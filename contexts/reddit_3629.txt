My ex girlfriend passed away. I’m overwhelmed with sadness and guilt. I can’t stop crying...help.
I found out on NYE that my ex girlfriend passed away on Christmas Eve. Sadly, our relationship faded toward the end of 2018; and it did not end amicably.  I haven’t tried to date anyone else since. I went through a healing process in 2019 and started to really love and take care of myself. I was head over heels in love with her and wanted her back in my life. I was hoping to reconnect with her in 2020 to rekindle, at the very least, a friendship. I wanted to apologize to for drifting away and for not giving any effort to fight for her.  Now my heart is guilt stricken and I haven’t been the same since I learned she passed. My eyes are full of tears everyday. I have tried to distract the pain; however, there’s no treatment plan for this pain. I’m a wreck :(
