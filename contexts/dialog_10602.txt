KEITH: I mean, what for?
CARTER: That's what I was wondering.
KEITH: Come off it. Frank was... well... straight. He had no worries I know. Hell, we worked together every day for a year. It would have showed.
CARTER: Why would it?
KEITH: It just would. He was always the same.
CARTER: Since when did he drink whisky?
KEITH: Don't know.
CARTER: Nobody seems to know.
