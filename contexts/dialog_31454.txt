CARLOS: I'll never forget you got me started there.
WALTER: I just recommended you. You still had to prove yourself.
CARLOS: Hey, is that a school?
WALTER: K through sixth.
CARLOS: Living across the street from a grade school. Jesus.
WALTER: Something wrong with that?
CARLOS: I was just thinking of... the noise.
WALTER: I like the noise.
WALTER: One hundred and twenty feet.
CARLOS: What?
WALTER: Law says I can't come within one hundred feet of where children congregate. I figure the distance from my window to the school is one hundred and twenty. Make a bet?
CARLOS: No way, man, you'd rob me blind!
CARLOS: But maybe it's not so healthy being so close, you know, to a school.
WALTER: You find me a decent place for under three hundred a month in this town, and I'll happily move out of this crap neighborhood.
CARLOS: I should go. Your sister worries, and when she worries she yells.
WALTER: How is she?
CARLOS: Annette? She's good... tense.
WALTER: When can I see her?
CARLOS: I'm working on it.
WALTER: Is it because of Anna?
CARLOS: I don't know. She won't talk about it.
WALTER: You're the only one in the family who still talks to me.
CARLOS: I remember when they all referred to me as the little spic poor Annette married." Except her brother. You treated me with respect. Look
WALTER: How old is Anna?
CARLOS: She'll be twelve next week. We're throwing a big party on Saturday. Wish I could ask you to come...
WALTER: Only if it's no closer than a hundred feet.
