JELLY: Looks like every time we get together things are in a mess.
SISSY: So be it. It looks serious this time, though. All these guns... are you actually prepared to kill and die for whooping cranes?
JELLY: Hell no, the cranes are wonderful, okay, but I'm not in this for whooping cranes. I'm in it for cowgirls. If we cowgirls give in to authority on this crane issue, then cowgirls become just another compromise. I want a finer fate than that -- for me and for every other cowgirl. Better no cowgirls at all than cowgirls compromised.
SISSY: How did this business get started, anyhow? Why are the birds nesting here?
