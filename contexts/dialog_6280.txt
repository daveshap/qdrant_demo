VINCENT: Would you have called her?
MAX: Who?
VINCENT: Your lady friend. The one who gave you her business card. Think she was just being polite?
MAX: I don't know.
VINCENT: What holds you back, Max? Tell me. Why does life scare you so much?
MAX: I only owe you a ride, Vincent.
VINCENT: It's not what you owe <u>me.</u> Time is so fleeting. One day it's gone. You make it out of this alive, Max, you really should call her. That's what I think.
