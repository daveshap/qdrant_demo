JACK: It'd be the best thing for you. You know what? I'm going to get you laid this week. That's going to be my best man gift to you. I'm not going to give you a pen knife or a gift certificate or any of that other horseshit.
MILES: I'd rather have a knife.
JACK: No. No. You've been officially depressed for like two years now, and you were always a negative guy anyway, even in college. Now it's worse -- you're wasting away. Teaching English to fucking eighth-graders when they should be reading what you wrote. Your books.
MILES: I'm working on it.
JACK: You still seeing that shrink?
MILES: I went on Monday. But I spent most of the time helping him with his computer.
JACK: Well, I say fuck therapy and what's that stuff you take, Xanax?
MILES: And Lexapro, yes.
JACK: Well, I say fuck that. You need to get your joint worked on, that's what you need.
MILES: Jack. This week is not about me. It's about you. I'm going to show you a good time. We're going to drink a lot of good wine, play some golf, eat some great food, enjoy the scenery and send you off in style.
JACK: And get your bone smooched.
