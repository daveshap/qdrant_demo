The Girl Of My Dreams Doesn't Like Me
I've been best friends with this girl for about 3 years. She is my absolute everything and I care almost too much about her. I recently asked her out and she rejected me. I've never felt more pain then knowing I just got rejected by who I beleive is the person who was made for me. The worst part is when I felt like maybe I wasnt  boyfriend material, and she proceeded to say "you're way more than boyfriend material". The fact that she told me I was more than boyfriend material and yet still broke my heart is driving me mad. This is not the first time this has happened, and I'm seriously considering suicide at this point. I just want a release.
