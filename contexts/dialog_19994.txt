BETTY: You never mentioned a 'Stella' to me.
GEORGE: Didn't I?
BETTY: No, I would have remembered that name. The only Stella I ever knew was a parrot. Was this before Leslie? Before us?...
GEORGE: I've never met anyone like you, Betty.
BETTY: I know, that's why we were meant to be together...
GEORGE: No, I mean your dedication scares me...
BETTY: It's easy to be dedicated, when you care about something...
GEORGE: Yeah, I felt that way, too, when I first started, but now... the hours, the repetition... it's not all glamour and mall openings anymore. Maybe I should've listened to my people and tried to make the crossover to nights earlier, I don't know... ...I just hope it's not too late for me. God! Listen to me, Me
BETTY: ...but I love listening to you, so that's okay...
GEORGE: Thanks. But I'd like to hear what you're feeling...
BETTY: Well, I just feel that life'll be much sweeter for you now with me around. I promise...
GEORGE: You know, I almost believe that... you're like a warm breeze that's suddenly blown into my life... I said that to Leslie, once, at her funeral, remember?...
BETTY: I remember. You said it to her, but it was meant for me, wasn't it?
GEORGE: Yes... maybe it was.
