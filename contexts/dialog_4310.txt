BETTY: I don't mind waiting.
MICHAEL: Well, there's a lot of boring stuff to do. Lists of people we have to write to. Find mama's relatives addresses in Italy -- stuff like that.
BETTY: Well, I can help.
MICHAEL: I said NO!
BETTY: I do not need instructions from you to bathe! I knew you'd do this! I knew I'd come all the way here and be shut out as usual! I came to be here for you! I didn't have to come! Lord knows I was never much welcome in this house before. Apparently dead or alive, nothing's changed.
CAROLYN: Aw, Betty.
BETTY: Carolyn -- you want these candlesticks?
CAROLYN: No. You can have them.
