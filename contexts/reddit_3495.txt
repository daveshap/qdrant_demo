Dating is easy
Dating shouldn't be hard. Its a built in buddy system. Hold hands with your buddy so you don't get separated. Check in on your buddy. Be a good buddy. 

Yeah, arguments and problems happen. They shouldn't be the majority of the relationship. Trust me. No matter how much you love a person, no matter what you would do for a person, if it's not working its not working. 

If your buddy doesn't check on you? It's not healthy. 
If your buddy doesn't care about you? Nope!
If your buddy hurts you? Get outta there buckaroono!
If your buddy is confused if they still want to be buddies? They should know if they want to work it out, and if they are "unsure" LEAVE!!

Nothing hurts more than getting out of a relationship and realizing how bad you were treated because they were a bad buddy. 

Tell your trusted friends everything. See their response. All the red flags just look like flags when you're wearing rose colored glasses. You can't trust yourself sometimes.
