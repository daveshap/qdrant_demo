Advice on bringing up WFH?
Got a new job about 3 weeks ago. In my offer the HR Recruiter said I could work from home 3 days a week after 2 weeks in the office. 

On week 3 now and nobody has said anything on setting it up.

 Any advice on how to ask for this without sounding like I  don't want to work. Not everyone in my office has WFH access but was told when I accepted the offer I could.

TIA!
