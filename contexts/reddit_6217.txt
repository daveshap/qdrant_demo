I think the interviewer tricked me
 

So I got this retail job, I figured it's a good way to earn some extra cash since I'm a full time uni student and want something I can do in summer and keep when uni starts again, BTW I am currently preooccupied with other projects unrelated to work so I don't have much free time

Anyway during the interview I was told I'd get to choose when I can work (which isn't out of the ordinary, most PT jobs here let you pick your times) I let them know about the side projects Im doing and that I won't be available most days of the week, and they said it's fine. I was told I'd get contacted (after I sign my contract) by the store manager so I can let him know my hours.

Long story short, they told me to come in for a full day and I did. The next day (today) I was told my hours for the next week and apparently, they put me in for FOUR whole days, like starting at 9 and finishing at 8pm. I told the store manager that I had a different agreement with the HR lady and she basically shrugged me off and said I need to ''bear'' with her and she ''needs'' me because they're understaffed..

I only agreed to this job because they promised flexible hours! What should I do? Should I tell HR people about this or forget it and keep on searching since they quite obviously tricked me and never even asked me what days I could work, pretty much everything that was promised in the interview was a lie.
