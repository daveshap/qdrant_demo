It’s really sad how lonely being suicidal is
Like, you can’t talk to anyone. 

And if you can, it’s like maybe one or two people. Half of them are probably your medical team, who check in with you once or twice a week, and are paid to care about you. 

You know all your “family and friends care” but it’s impossible to talk to them. You don’t want them to overreact. You don’t want them to worry. 

You can’t hang out with your friends anymore because you have nothing positive or noteworthy to say. No one wants to go to dinner or to a bar and hear about how you hate living. You don’t want to bring the mood down all the time. 

And the one person you trust to talk to can’t handle all of your stress. You can’t rely on just that person. It takes a toll on them and stresses them out too, so now you start censoring yourself and feel like you can’t tell them everything. 

And then you’re just stuck with your thoughts in your head. Wondering what’s the best thing to do. 


And then there’s the planning. 

What to write in your note saying goodbye. What to do with your dog. How to leave your apartment. What date to set. 

I just wish euthanasia was legal so I could die with my friends and family by my side. I wish I could talk freely about my thoughts and plans, and have support in my decision. I wish someone could be by my side in my last moments. 

But no, I have to do this alone. And it’s so lonely. 

I’m not afraid of dying. I’m slowly learning to not be afraid if I fail trying to die, and die suffering slowly and painfully. I just wish I wasn’t lonely through it all. I wish someone could hold my hand and hug me before I go.
