HADDEN: A sunrise and a sunset every forty- five minutes.
ELLIE: It's so... small.
HADDEN: Poor, tired, spinning girl... How we feasted on her. And now that we've had our fill and given her a giant dose of the clap... we're pulling out. That's Paris, where my daughter was born. Moscow, where gangsters rule the night and I gave up smoking. So many battles, so many lives... all that sturm, and drang. As if it never happened. If it weren't for a few power grids, you wouldn't know we existed.
ELLIE: What's that?
HADDEN: Japanese squid fleet. They use lights to attract them to the surface... then turn them into sushi.

HADDEN: Hokkaido Island.
ELLIE: The systems integration site.
HADDEN: Mmm. Look closer.
HADDEN: As each component was tested and shipped off to Texas a duplicate was maintained and assembled in Hokkaido -- for backup purposes, of course. We've been right behind you the entire time. You see my problem: I couldn't appear to control too large a percentage; my enemies wouldn't stand for it. So I simply made sure the Japanese consortium received the systems integration contract. Of course no one had to know the corporations involved were recently acquired, wholly-owned subsidiaries --
ELLIE: -- of Hadden Industries.
