Tonight I finally asked the guy in the next apartment over to stop yelling to people over the computer to all hours of the night after about 3 months of trouble sleeping because of the noise.
I was shaking the whole time but I said what I meant to and this is a major win for me. Of course Iâ€™m going to ruminate on the situation now and have trouble sleeping for that reason tonight but hopefully tomorrow night will be better. And yeah, the yelling was really that bad.
