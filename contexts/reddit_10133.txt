Phi Beta Kappa invitation
Is it worth the $85 to join? I've learned that this honor society is actually legit, but that many students only join for the self-worth and to put it on their resume (nothing wrong with that). I'm wonderin, does being a member make any difference for someone who is entering the higher education / student affairs profession? For reference, I've already been admitted to a master's program. Thanks in advance!
