MICHAEL: I thought everything WAS arranged.
CAROLYN: Well, there's a problem.
MICHAEL: What problem?
LAWYER: Your mother left explicit instructions that she wished to be cremated.
MICHAEL: Cremated?!
BETTY: Eeeww!
CAROLYN: I know. I don't understand it either.
MICHAEL: When did she decide this?
LAWYER: Apparently just before her death.
MICHAEL: Well, that's crazy. I don't know anybody who gets cremated.
BETTY: My Jewish friend's grandmother did.
MICHAEL: Well, no one in my family did! Dad bought cemetery plots at Oak Ridge. One for him, one for mom.
LAWYER: It clearly states in the will --
MICHAEL: I don't care what it says! Maybe Mama was delirious, you know. She didn't know what she was saying. If she wanted to be cremated, why the hell did she let dad buy two plots, huh?
LAWYER: Well, she was very specific. She wanted her ashes to be thrown over Roseman Bridge.
MICHAEL: WHAT!
BETTY: How bizarre!
CAROLYN: Mr. Peterson, are you sure mama wrote all this?
LAWYER: Well, it was notarized, and witnessed by a Mrs. Lucy Delaney. Maybe you can ask her.
MICHAEL: Who the hell is Lucy Delaney?
CAROLYN: I remember a Mrs. Delaney but Mama told me years ago she died.
MICHAEL: Well, I don't care if it's legal or not, we're not cremating her and throwing her all over some bridge where we can't even go visit her because she's going to be blown all over the place like an ashtray.
BETTY: Not to mention people driving over her and doggies doing their business --
MICHAEL: We're not doing it! I'm not even sure it's Christian.
BETTY: Maybe it's an Italian thing. Their mother was Italian.
MICHAEL: Doesn't matter. Move on.
