For those of us that can't donate to team trees
We all know the problem, you're broke, or your parents are horrible boomers. So ya can't donate to #teamtrees. Fear not! You can still do something for the environment

When you're free from school early and you live in a temperate climate. Just go to the patch of forest on your route and clean that shit up, I just cleared a patch of forest of half my body weight in plastic and old newspapers. It might be a bit of a task but you can't say you didn't do anything.

And if you live in the city, do it the next time you come into the forest
