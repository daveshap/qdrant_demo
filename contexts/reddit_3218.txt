Should I Report My Manager?
I’ve been working on a small HR team with this particular manager for the last 9 months or so. My coworkers have recently confided in me their issues with our manager (on top of my own grievances) which include:

- Comments he frequently makes towards female direct reports, like “Why aren’t you smiling?”. I’m the only other male on the team, never get comments like that.

- He chronically steals company time. He disappears for 2-4 hours a day every day. Does not let us know where he’s been and is unreachable during these times. He does not log these hours as time off (part of my job is to track this for all employees).

- He will take vacation days or work remotely last minute, letting us know the morning of. 

- Is chronically unavailable and hard to find in the office - causes our work/projects to grind to halt without any supervision.

- I cannot speak to his personal life, but he has drank heavily at at least two company events and driven drunk. On one such occasion when he was drunk, he offered me a ride home. I declined.

- I recently got diagnosed with a serious medical issue that caused chronic migraines. My manager took me aside and criticized me for not working fast enough despite knowing full well of my condition. Essentially sent the message that if I can’t work fast enough, I should just take a sick day.

- Everyone on our team did not provide critical feedback of him during his annual review for fear of reprisals. He is the type to hold a grudge. 

My other coworkers are more junior (first jobs out of college) and fear they will lose their jobs if they report him. I’m in a more senior role, and very upset at his management style and his hurtful reaction to and handling of my unexpected medical condition.

Should I report him to HR upper management? I fear for my job as well, since we are a small team I imagine he’ll figure out who actually reported him. 

I don’t want to ruin someone’s life by getting them fired. But I also fear that he will just get a slap on the wrist and then make our lives harder for the foreseeable future. 

Any advice or input would be greatly appreciated!

Edit: since it seems unclear to most people, I work in HR, and part of my job is maintaining HR software systems. So when I say my manager is stealing time, it is in fact (1) my job and (2) in my pay grade to track and know if people are stealing time and money from the company. And since I’ve worked there (less than a year) I have witnessed him steal 25+ days of time from the company.
