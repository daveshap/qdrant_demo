MIKE: Pirates of the fucking Caribbean.
TRENT: This is the hot new place, besides, you love pirates. Tell me Mikey doesn't love pirates.
MIKE: This is fuckin' post-pubescent Disneyland.
TRENT: You gotta love the pirates, baby. The pirates are money.
MIKE: This place is dead. I thought this was the city that never sleeps.
TRENT: That's New York, baby. You should know that. Look at the waitresses. I'm gonna get me a peg-leg baby.
MIKE: They're all skanks.
TRENT: Baby, there are beautiful babies here.
MIKE: Tee, the beautiful babies don't work Wednesdays midnight to six. This is the skank shift.
TRENT: What are you talking about? Look at all the honeys.
