LAURA: Are you worried about tomorrow night?
ROB: Not really.
LAURA: Are you going to talk to me, or shall I get my paper out?
ROB: I'm going to talk to you.
LAURA: Right.
LAURA: What are you going to talk to me about?
ROB: I'm going to talk to you about whether you want to get married or not. To me.
LAURA: Ha ha ha. Hoo hoo hoo.
ROB: I mean it.
LAURA: I know.
ROB: Oh, well thanks a fucking bunch.
LAURA: I'm sorry. But two days ago you were in love with that girl who interviewed you for The Reader, weren't you?
ROB: Not in love, exactly, but...
LAURA: Well forgive me if I don't think of you as the world's safest bet.
ROB: Would you marry me if I was?
LAURA: No. Probably not.
ROB: Right. Okay, then. Shall we go?
LAURA: Don't sulk. What brought all this on?
ROB: I don't know.
LAURA: Very persuasive.
ROB: Are you persuadable?
LAURA: No. I don't think so. I'm just curious about how one goes from making tapes for one person to marriage proposals to another in two days. Fair enough?
ROB: Fair enough.
LAURA: So?
ROB: I'm just sick of thinking about it all the time.
LAURA: About what?
ROB: This stuff. Love and marriage. I want to think about something else.
LAURA: I've changed my mind. That's the most romantic thing I've ever heard. I do. I will.
ROB: Shut up. I'm only trying to explain.
LAURA: I mean, maybe you're right. But were you really expecting me to say yes?
ROB: I dunno. Didn't think about it, really. It was the asking that was the important thing.
LAURA: Well, you've asked.
