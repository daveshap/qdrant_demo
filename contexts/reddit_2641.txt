Will I get blacklisted for reserving my legal rights with a would-be employer?
Without going into too much identifying detail. I work in creative/tech in a large North American city and recently interviewed for a lucrative contract role for a Fortune 500 company. 

The hiring manager and I mostly communicated through the recruiter at first but after several phone screenings and a great on-site interview, he started to personally call and email me. He offered effusive praise such as “everybody loves you” and told me that the job was basically in the bag. He even went as far as to tell me that they were not interviewing other candidates. I was thrilled!

The only catch? I had to complete a hiring assignment. OK, no problem.

I’ve accepted these in the past but usually they are only 1 to 2 hours at most. This one was easily 12 hours of work that I diligently completed and even went above and beyond in many respects. I had a friend of mine who is senior in the industry review my work and she agreed that it was very high-quality after I made just a couple of tweaks.

Getting to the point, the hiring manager totally blew me off and went with another candidate after I busted my ass doing this take-home assignment. I started to get suspicious of his motivations based on several red flags I regretted ignoring. Couldn’t even get any meaningful feedback from him.

Had an attorney write a letter to the company’s head general counsel reserving my copyright to the content and affirming they don’t have the right to use it. The wording was low-key, factual, and professional. 

I’m not trying to get any payment from them, just protecting my rights not to have free work extracted from me by a potential employer just to be ghosted after false promises.

I feel good about standing up for myself not be taken advantage of but now I’m worried that this guy will go and drag my name around the industry. Has anyone else ever done this and how did it go for you in your subsequent job search?
