MARY: Oh, no.
GEORGE: Come on, tell me.
MARY: If I told you it might not come true.
GEORGE: What is it you want, Mary? What do you want? You want the moon? Just say . . .
MARY: I'll take it. And then what?
GEORGE: Well, then you could swallow it and it'd all dissolve, see? And the moonbeams'd shoot out of your fingers and your toes, and the ends of your hair. Am I talking too much?
