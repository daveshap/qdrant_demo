Secret santa embarrassment
Just wanted advice 
So today we had a mini secret santa party in our class where everyone had to get food, after filling my plate with food I put it on the edge of a table and it flipped and all the food was kn the floor, only one of my friend had helped me clean up and I was soo happy , but embarrassed at the same time, people didnt really care but being a teenager I really am embarrassed, do you think that it was an embarrassing moment or should I just forget about it. Please help me. Thank you
