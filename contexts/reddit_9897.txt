How do other schools view online classes?
Hi everyone. Sorry if my question is stupid but I was wondering how do other colleges view online classes? I currently go to a community college and have taken 4-5 online classes instead of the traditional classes, in part because online classes fit my schedule better and I can do all my work from home. Once I transfer to a 4 year college, do you think the fact that I have taken so many online classes will have any impact on my acceptance? Do other colleges look down on online classes? Or are online classes held to the same standard as traditional classes? I feel like online classes are considered easier... Anyway thanks for answering!!
