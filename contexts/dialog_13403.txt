BERT: It's what Eddie wants. He, uh, told me to give you some money.
SARAH: Put it on the bed. That's the way it's done, isn't it?
BERT: That's the way it's done.
SARAH: And the way you're looking at me, is that the way you look at a man you've just beaten? As if you'd just taken his money, and now all you want is... his pride?
BERT: All I want's the money.
