Xbee pro s2c 2.4 ghz 10dbi Antenna and its effect Just wondreing  how to increase the range/distance of communication between two xbee modules operating in API mode,we are considering to replace the 2.4 ghz antenna of 5dbi gain with 10dbi high gain antenna, does it work and fit into our need, the only term i cannot understand is the power requirements of the antenna.Does antennas draw more power if their gain is higher? And also the xbee pro s2c module power is limited to 10mw as per the digi website.
