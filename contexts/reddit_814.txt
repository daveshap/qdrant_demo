What to do?
So I'm 17 and it's this girl I know age 17, we've been talking for awhile (like 3 years) and I never really notice that she may have like me. Here's a little backstory about me (to skip this just scroll into I put "The Problem") so I am a handsome guy and all my life I always had girls come up to me and flirt but since I never really learn or practice social skills I never really knew it was flirting. I had girls and some homosexual guys flirt with me and since I've never pick it up and saw it as "just socializing" when it came to actually chasing women or trying to pursue someone I was and still am bad at it. I have everything giving to me based off my looks, but I still have a personality. I like to laugh, talk, and hangout, with people (as long it's not pill popping or smoking). 


*The Problem*, I really like this girl and looking back at are interactions with each other it seem like she like me back. As of this year being a senior in highschool I decided to focus on school because I need to pass ALL my classes if I'm going to graduate (fuck up freshmen and sophomore year). The problem with that is as I'm trying to focus on passing I have seem to not really talk to her at all, like completely cut her off and I do admit that was my fault. Now when I see her it feels like she doesn't like me no more or at the very least do like me but don't show any more signs like she used to. How can I change this because I do like her a lot and I want to be with her, just with school I do need to finish it if I'm going to continue my life and mature.
