Does anyone else ever get to a point where they feel emotionally detached from even the most important people in their life?
Like, I've never felt so empty or so bad that I just don't care about anyone or anything anymore. I can't even bring myself to see or talk to my bf, who has been my greatest support this year. It's not that anyone's done anything, I just can't feel anything except a crippling emptiness that makes me want to disappear.
