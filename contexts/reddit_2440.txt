Anyone else ever just feel like it’s over?
34 years old. 

-Had a management job for 6 years only making 40k
-Went onto sales making almost 80k a year but hated my life 
-Do marketing merchandise installing now for $32k a year, usually like it but feels underpaid in comparison 

I messed up in college. Live in a rather small area that I can’t move too far from due to family. 

Nothing seems to interest me, or feels like it’ll take so long that I can’t reach it.

I have no debt. I also have two kids.

I just feel like my life’s over at 34.

Only good thing I have is a 800+ credit score.

Edit: worked on finance underwriting for 3 years and company was bought out. Made about 50k
