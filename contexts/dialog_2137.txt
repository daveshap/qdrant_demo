DOUG: Not bad hey, I think I'll add Sparkie to my resume.....Good shovel!
CHRIS: Yeah, you're in luck there's two of them, the other's in there.
DOUG: Later Mate, right now I've got to do the locks on these doors so we don't have to climb through that bloody window every time.
CHRIS: I thought that was part of the charm!
DOUG: I'll drill the locks and replace the barrels, that way it won't cost so much.
CHRIS: A locksmith too? Why d'you ever bother with writing?
DOUG: I'm making history Chris, nothings going to stop me. There could be a knighthood for us in this, once President Havel hears.
CHRIS: I'll settle for a pardon. You gotta drill?
DOUG: No.....But I think Honza at the office has. You keep shifting this crap and I'll take care of the locks, shouldn't take long. Take a break for lunch and I'll catch you up later.
CHRIS: And if the police stop by - what do I tell them?
DOUG: Tell them we're working for the University.
CHRIS: Thought of everything haven't you.
DOUG: Yep, except a name for this place.
CHRIS: You're nuts man, Katka's right!
