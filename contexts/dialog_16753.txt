CHLOE: Hello.
BOBBY: Chloe?
CHLOE: Uncle Bobby?
BOBBY: Hi, baby. What are you doing awake? Where's mommy?
CHLOE: I don't know.
BOBBY: Mommy's not home?
CHLOE: No.
BOBBY: What time is it there?
CHLOE: Can you take me to Color Me Mine?
BOBBY: Yeah. Are you sure mommy's not home? It's very late.
BOBBY: I gotta go, baby. I love you. Tell mommy I called. You be a big girl and be careful when you're alone.
CHLOE: I love you. Come home.
