O2 molecues speed in air, and their limit Temperature is the proportional measure of kinetic energy of the random motion of the constituent micro particles in a system as per wikipedia.Now I understand that O2 molecules are randomly moving in air at normal temperatures.I could not find if we could define the speed of these molecules at a certain temperature.Obviously these particles with rest mass cannot move as fast as light. So they must cause a max limit to temperature.I wanted to know if there was a limit to the temperature of air (gases) due to this speed limit of their constituent gas molecules? Is this temperature the absolute max (like absolute min 0 K)? Have we ever seen anything close to this in the universe?Question:What is the speed of the random motion of O2 molecules in air at normal temperature (20Celsius)Is there a function or equation that would describe the connection directly between this speed of the O2 molecules and the temperature of the air they are in? Does this speed (must be smaller then c) give a limit to the absolute max temperature?
