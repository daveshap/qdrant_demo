LOUELLA: Schaefer, I gotta see this Welles picture
SCHAEFER: Louella, hello, I was just fixing a drink, would you like--?
LOUELLA: You drink at 10 am, do you?
SCHAEFER: No -- no -- I mean--
LOUELLA: I wanna see the picture today
SCHAEFER: That might be a tad difficult because Orson is scoring the picture now and he's very particular about the music--
LOUELLA: Cut the malarkey, buddy. The boss himself wants me to see the picture today.
SCHAEFER: He personally asked you to?
LOUELLA: That's right
SCHAEFER: Hearst?
LOUELLA: Uh-huh
