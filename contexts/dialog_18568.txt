JENNER: A few days... When he heard, the Prince of Wales threw the bust from the window of the Royal Gallery. It took four hours to gather the fragments.
PONSONBY: The Queen wishes to publish an account of him.
JENNER: Dear oh dear.

JENNER: Well, no rest for the wicked, Henry.
PONSONBY: No, indeed.
