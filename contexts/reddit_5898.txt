Need help on tutoring in apts
I'm a college student and I'm bored due to the pandemic. I would like to help students with their homework via Zoom. I'm planning to post a sign on the bulletin board saying that I will tutor and help students with their assignments but I am not aware with the procedure of advertising. What are some things I should be aware of before posting it? I'm not charging money  but I would like a small donation ($5?). How do I add my contact info. What can get me into trouble?
