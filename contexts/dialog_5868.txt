GITTES: Yeah.
MORTY: Drowned, too.
GITTES: Come again?
MORTY: Yeah, got dead drunk, passed out in the bottom of the riverbed.
GITTES: The L.A. River?
MORTY: Yeah, under Hollenbeck Bridge, what's wrong with that?
GITTES: It's bone dry, Morty.
MORTY: It's not completely dry.
GITTES: Yeah, well he ain't gonna drown in a damp riverbed either, I don't care how soused he was. That's like drowning in a teaspoon.
