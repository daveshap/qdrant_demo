LANA: I can never get a way from it.
CLARK: Old ties are hard to cut.
LANA: No. I mean, yes they are, but I was talking about that. Wheat King. Bet your bottom dollar that's a Wheat King thresher.
LANA: That's the biggest change in Smallville, you know. They've taken over this town. Everybody who isn't actually working for Wheat King -- like I do -- is out there -- on a Wheat King thresher. Do you think I could do it? Do you?
CLARK: Ride a thresher? Well, I don't know. Girls are trying just about everything now but --
LANA: No, what you said before, Could I make it in Metropolis? I've dreamed about it, sure, but I never really thought about it. What would I do when I got there?
CLARK: Call me.
LANA: Oh, I wouldn't want to -- I mean, I'd want to, but I wouldn't want to...be a nuisance to you.
