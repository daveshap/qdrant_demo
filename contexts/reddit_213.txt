Should I feel like I am in the wrong?
This is my first post so sorry if I do anything wrong.

So I live with my grandparents and they are Jehovah's Witnesses. After growing up with their religion I have chosen to not be in it. I am the only child in the whole family still "in the religion" and they have called me their only hope which puts pressure on me that I don't want. I have tried before to tell them I don't want to be a part of their religion but when I did they said I was disappointing them after all they have done for me (if i didn't go to when them when I was a year old then i would have gone to my mothers grandparents who i don't know.) and my grandma even cried. Before confessing this I have indiscreetly asked what they would do if I didn't want to be a witness and they said that as long as I am under their house they would take me to church if i wanted to go or not. Growing up in the "truth" I know for a fact that Jehovah's Witnesses believe that no one should be forced into their religion.  I was planning on leaving the religion and getting a job at 16 to save up money to be able to live after 18 as they will probably kick me out. But after confessing the first time and seeing their sadness I begun thinking that me wanting to do my own thing is wrong and that I should just suck it up and be unhappy but make them happy which is what I have been doing. Also if I continue to go after becoming inactive people would look at me with disappointment which would hurt me emotionally. I seriously don't know what to think about this so any advice at all is happily welcomed and worshiped.
