SALIERI: Where is your wife?
MOZART: Not here! She's not well, either. She went to the Spa.
SALIERI: You mean she's not coming back?
MOZART: You're so good to me. Truly. Thank you.
SALIERI: No, please.
MOZART: I mean to come to my opera. You are the only colleague who did.
SALIERI: I would never miss anything that you had written. You must know that.
MOZART: This is only a vaudeville.
SALIERI: Oh no. It is a sublime piece. The grandest operone. I tell you, you are the greatest composer known to me.
MOZART: Do you mean that?
SALIERI: I do.
MOZART: I have bad fancies. I don't sleep well anymore. Then I drink too much, and think stupid things.
SALIERI: Are you ill?
MOZART: The doctor thinks I am. But -
SALIERI: What?
MOZART: I'm too young to be so sick.
SALIERI: Shall I answer it?
MOZART: No! No, it's him!
SALIERI: Who?
MOZART: The man. He's here.
SALIERI: What man?
