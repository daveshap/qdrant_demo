AMOS: Didn't kill anything, did I?
EDWARD: A few rabbits, but I think one of them was already dead.
AMOS: That would explain the indigestion.
AMOS: I was wrong about you kid. You may not have much, but what you got, you got a lot of. You could get any girl.
EDWARD: There's only one I want.
AMOS: Her name is Sandra Templeton. She's going to Auburn. The semester's almost over, so you better hurry.
EDWARD: Thank you.
AMOS: Good luck, kid.
