LILY: That's not --
JAKE: You interested in a little work?
LILY: Sorry about your wallet, but if you think I'm going to suck dick over thirty seven dollars, a maxed out Visa and a bad fake I.D., you're fucking crazy. Jake.
JAKE: Take a deep breath and count to ten. It's not that kind of work. You're Lily, right?
LILY: Says who?
JAKE: You're working Daffy's block. He was going to break your kneecaps. Pick- pockets can be so bitchy sometimes. I told him you were with us, so that's two you owe me.
JAKE: We have work. It pays a lot. Unless you figure on getting rich lifting wallets while old guys feel you up.
LILY: Oooh. Sassy. What do you care who feels me up, Jake? Unless it kinda gotcha going. Did it, Jake? Getcha going?
