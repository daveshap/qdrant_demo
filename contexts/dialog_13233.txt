MINERVA: We want Da Vinci's sketchbook, what do they call it, the Codex.
DARWIN: Listen Hawk, this might be hard to believe, but I'm a regular joe. I just want to be happy and happiness comes from the achieving of goals. It's just when you make your first billion by the age of 19, it's hard to keep coming up with new ones. But now finally I got my new goal. World domination. With your help...Bunny....quit that!
MINERVA: Bunny, ball-ball! Bad bunny!
