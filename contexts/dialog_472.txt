BUD: What's the matter with you?
HIPPY: Now we're right in the middle of this big-time international incident. Like the Cuban Missile Crisis or something.
LINDSEY: Figured that out for yourself, did you?
HIPPY: We got Russian subs creeping around. Shit! Something goes wrong they could say anything happened down here, man. Give our folks medals, know what I mean?
BUD: Hippy, just relax. You're making the women nervous.
LINDSEY: Cute, Virgil.
HIPPY: No, I mean it. Those SEALs aren't telling us diddly. Something's going on.
BUD: Hippy, you think everything's a conspiracy.
HIPPY: Everything is.
