Is it okay to quit a job because you feel like you are in the wrong place?
Hello, I feel like I’m not in the right place considering what I went to school for, plus additional time and money (thousands) spent on certification and education outside of regular school. 

My job is completely irrelevant to my degree. I took an extra year in school to major in a specific field, and spent thousands on outside education. I took the offer because it was the first paying offer I received. Almost 2 years later and nothing has changed. No opportunities. 

My job does not make use of my potential. Anyone could do this job. A grade 10 student would probably do this for minimum wage. 

If i quit, it’s easy money that’s loss. But easy isn’t good for my mind. I need stimulation/challenges. 

If i quit now, i’ll be jobless until I find something else, and I don’t know how long that will be. 

Sorry this turned out to be a semi rant. I’m seeking and appreciate any feedback and advice. Thanks
