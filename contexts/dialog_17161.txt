ANDY: Sir, do you have a problem?
ZMUDA: Yeah, my problem is you're tired.
ANDY: I, I was asked to do this material - -
ZMUDA: Sure, because your new stuff's a bunch of crap. Kaufman, people are sick of you. The wrestling... the hoaxes...

ZMUDA: Who gives a shit?! It's not funny!
GEORGE: Why...? Andy, why...?
ZMUDA: I used to think you were original.
ANDY: I was very original!
ZMUDA: Yeah, exactly -- was"! But now
ANDY: The world thinks Andy Kaufman sucks. So I was just giving 'em what they want...
GEORGE: Andy, they don't think you suck. They've just... lost a reason to love you.
