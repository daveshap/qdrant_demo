Eighties novel about robot killers who look like kids assassinating various military leaders, politicians and scientists This was a hardback book from a UK library \u2013 I read it in the late eighties. No memories of the book cover.<br>Some may say this is just a \u2018techno thriller\u2019 but there was a strong robot element.What I remember, evil organisation (or Cold War enemy) with bad scientists is having a go at world domination. They begin by assassinating various military leaders, politicians and scientists.One weapon deployed are robots that look like cute little kids (This is NOT \"Second Variety\" by PKD) and these robots approach their targets at home, pleading for help. Once they're at close range they explode and kill the leaders and anyone else within several yards.There is a frantic race on between the good defender teams and the evil killer teams, one side trying to stop the killer robots and the other side trying to carry out the hits.One bit I recall is a couple of kid robots have strolled into a chocolate shop and are acting enthusiastic for white chocolate. This was to gain the owners trust so they could get a scientist's address.
