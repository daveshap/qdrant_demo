FRANK: Where the hell is she?
JACK: It's early.
FRANK: I told everyone seven-fifteen. Didn't I? Seven-fifteen.
JACK: She'll get here.
FRANK: Just like the day of the auditions, right? Jesus. How's my hair?
JACK: Awe inspiring.
FRANK: Yeah, well, Your's isn't. Let me run a comb though it.
JACK: Get out of here.
FRANK: Come on, stand still.
JACK: Get out of here!
FRANK: It's not gonna hurt you.
JACK: I'll hit you, Frank. I swear.
FRANK: You hit me.
JACK: I told you I was gonna hit you.
FRANK: All right, all right. I'm a little tense.
JACK: You're a fucking alarm clock.
FRANK: I just wish she'd get here, that's all.
JACK: She's here.
FRANK: Christ, look at her. You'd think if she was gonna wear her street clothes she'd have enough sense to come in the back. Good evening, Miss Diamond. You're late.
SUSIE: Where's my name?
FRANK: What-?
SUSIE: And how come you guys are the only ones with your pictures on the poster?
FRANK: We'll talk about it later. Right now, you gotta get changed.
SUSIE: Changed?
FRANK: Where's your dress?
SUSIE: What's he talking about?
FRANK: Is there a language problem here? Your dress. For tonight. Where is it?
SUSIE: Do I look like I'm naked?
FRANK: That! You can't wear that!
SUSIE: What's wrong with it?
FRANK: It's orange!
SUSIE: Am I missing something?
FRANK: Come on.
SUSIE: Hey!
FRANK: Come on. We don't have much time.
SUSIE: Time for what?
SUSIE: If you ask me, this is pretty stupid.
FRANK: Just look. What do you wear? A nine?
SUSIE: A seven.
FRANK: My wife wears a seven. You don't look like a seven to me.
SUSIE: I wear a seven.
FRANK: Okay, okay. Here, how about this?
SUSIE: Save it for your wife.
FRANK: We're not exactly silly with time, you know. Jack, you find anything?
JACK: No.
FRANK: Here, how's this?
