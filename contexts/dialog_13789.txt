THOMAS SANDEFUR: Jeff's a premiere golfer... What are you, a two handicap?
WIGAND: Seven...
THOMAS SANDEFUR: And, he gets out there and he has five strokes on us. He has more concentration than anybody I've ever met. It's spooky how he can concentrate.
WIGAND: I'd rather play than talk about it. What did you want to see me about? I don't like being back here.
THOMAS SANDEFUR: Jeffrey says exactly what's on his mind. Most people consider what they're saying... social skills... Jeffrey just charges right ahead. Now, I know you understood the nature of the confidentiality portion of your severance agreement with Brown & Williamson, Jeff...
WIGAND: Chapter and verse.
THOMAS SANDEFUR: Yeah, I know you do... You know, I came up through sales. One of the reasons I was a great salesman, was I never made a promise I couldn't keep. I knew that if I ever broke my promise I'd suffer the consequence...
WIGAND: Is that a threat?
THOMAS SANDEFUR: ...we worked together for, what was it, three years...? Now, the work we did here is confidential, not for public scrutiny... any more than are one's family matters...
WIGAND: You threatening my family, now, too?
THOMAS SANDEFUR: Now, don't be paranoid, Jeff. About the direction of research here, we may have had our differences of opinion...
WIGAND: Research..." You declare
THOMAS SANDEFUR: That's why we hire scientists...
WIGAND: Okay. I don't believe you can maintain corporate integrity without confidentiality agreements. I was paid well for my work. The health and welfare benefits are good. The severance package is fair. I have no intention of violating my confidentiality agreement and disclosing that which I said I wouldn't.
THOMAS SANDEFUR: I appreciate all that, Jeff. But, upon reflection... we've decided to expand our zone of comfort with you.
