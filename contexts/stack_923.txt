On booting ubuntu installer from PD, it shows up a black screen with error codes I am having HP Compaq dc5800 small form factor PC with 2 GB RAM, 2.20 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo Processor, 160 GB of HDD, Intel Q33 integrated graphics and I am currently running Windows 10 Pro (32-bit), although my PC i s 64-bit supported. When I boot my PC from Ubuntu 18.04 installation media (flash drive), it opens up a screen with options like try Ubuntu without installing, install Ubuntu, check drive for errors and 2 more. But when I click any of the above two options, it displays a command prompt like black read only screen with error codes on it. I want to install Ubuntu in dual boot with Windows 10.
