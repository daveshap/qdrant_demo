You have 2 days left to apply to [insert college or university I'm 100% not going to apply to]
Like chill out if I was going to apply to your school It would be on my mind, like i have the common app screaming at me too, you dont need to yell at me as well. I got 6 emails in a row this morning within one hour of each other. Jesus.
