I’ve been told by multiple people that care about me to seek help from a therapist, but every time I’ve seen one my anxiety goes through the roof because I have to share intimate details of my life with a stranger.
How can I convince myself that it is the right decision to get help when it just feels like every time I try I slip back into bad habits.
