Has the United States and Iran engaged in activities in an attempt to de-escalate potential conflicts after contentious events?
American and Iranian relations are quite tense [following the killing of Maj. Gen Solemani](https://www.npr.org/2020/01/02/793208096/iraqi-tv-says-top-iranian-military-leader-killed-in-rocket-strikes-on-iraqi-airp). The Iranian Foreign Minister described the killing as an act of [both terrorism and war](https://www.npr.org/2020/01/07/794150712/irans-foreign-minister-u-s-strike-on-soleimani-an-act-of-terrorism-and-war) and hours later, Iranian forces [attacked](https://www.npr.org/2020/01/07/794388410/military-base-housing-u-s-troops-in-iraq-has-been-attacked) a US/Coalition base in Iraq. 

This is not the first time the US has had [difficulties with](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93United_States_relations) Iran since the 1979 Iranian Revolution, yet the two countries have yet to engage in prolonged direct conflict. When looking back at the history between the two countries since the Iranian Revolution : 

* Did the two countries ever engage in diplomatic activities following a contentious event in an attempt to de-escalate the situation? 

* Was a formal agreement reached? If so, did both countries honor the terms of the agreement?
