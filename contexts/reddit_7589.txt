What graduate degree would you suggest I pursue given...
 

* Bachelor's in business (no foundational coursework in biology, programming, engineering, or any other specialization)
* Current job: consultant (pharma clients exclusively)
* Live in major city with salary: \~$100K
* I enjoy teaching myself (via MOOCs) programming, statistics, biology, economics, data visualization software skills
* Assume I'm open to relocation and have unlimited budget for grad school (for the sake of this experiment)
* My main #1 goal is to increase my salary as much as possible (I know that's not the best approach to life but assume for this question this is my only goal)
