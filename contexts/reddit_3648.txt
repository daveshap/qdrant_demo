A scientific look into why some men leave after sex
Maybe you've heard men say "Women get so attached after sex".. Or maybe you've heard women say "After sex, he seemed not as interested".

I wasn’t going to post this but I think that it might give some insight even just a tiny bit into why some men “leave after sex”.  I’ve seen many posts about women wondering why the man only wanted sex and everything was fine before sex etc on here so I just wanted to give a little bit of “biology fun fact” type of information on the male and female brain during sex. **Im not an expert by any means** but I am a biology enthusiast going for her doctorate now (not a biologist though) so I’ve read up on this a little bit enough to post this information here which might give some insight to some situations which I think could potentially a tiny bit helpful or interesting.

**Edit: DISCLAIMER: I am not an expert biologist specializing in this topic.** However, the studies I've read and information on hormones is public information. Do your own research please as well. 

**My point for this post was to give/add a different perspective on sex on this subreddit.** There are many variables and every human is different. There are also different situations and nuances.

**TLDR:** When a man and woman have sex, oxytocin is released. Women feel this “cuddle hormone” and men don’t because their high level of testosterone blocks it. A man's vasopressin (lust and attraction hormone) that had been building up for the woman prior also drops after sex. 

This hormone allows women to feel closer and good about her relationship with the man. Whereas the man hasn’t felt that at all, and due to the dropped vasopressin and not feeling oxytocin, he will move on to spread his seed. 

Only when a man has true feelings for a woman and he makes the decision to commit/be vulnerable/let his guard down with her, his testosterone drops enough to feel oxytocin. This is when the man and woman both feel oxytocin and bond and both “make love”. Oxytocin gives feelings of trust, love, etc.

**PLEASE WATCH THIS VIDEO by an expert biologist who says everything I'm saying with references and study data:**  **Dawn Maslar’s Ted Talk** - which sums this information up perfectly in short video form (called: "How Your Brain Falls In Love")

**Longer Version**

This is the cuddle hormone and for women, it skyrockets during sex. This hormone comes out when a woman is giving birth and having sex etc. it makes the woman feel bonded to the man and more trusting and closer to him (and her baby during pregnancy).

The high level of testosterone in men blocks the effects of oxytocin. He does not feel those same effects of a closer bond with the woman (there are exceptions, more on them later).

In fact, vasopressin in men builds as he feels sexual attraction for a woman like when dating her, seeing her, being in anticipation, etc (lust, attraction, affiliation hormone). But immediately after sex, his vasopressin buildup for the woman drops. And testosterone blocks oxytocin.

So therefore after sex, the woman is feeling closer to the man and good about the relationship. 

Whereas a man's vasopressin buildup for the woman has dropped and he hasn’t felt the effects of oxytocin at all. Due to biology, if he didn’t have feelings for the woman, it is in his nature to continue to spread his seed elsewhere. 

**HOWEVER, THIS IS THE EXCEPTION: when a man HAS FEELINGS for and/or LOVES a woman** and decides he wants to commit/be with her in his mind, his **testosterone levels DROP when he lets his guard down and makes the decision to be vulnerable to her**, allowing him to feel the same in love, bond, trust feelings of the oxytocin hormone as the woman does during sex. 

Due to the lowered level of testosterone, oxytocin is now able to work and that is when a man is able to “make love” to the woman and feel all of the oxytocin hormone.
