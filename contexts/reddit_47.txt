So I've had a crush for 6 years...
I don't know how to approach him, because I just recently realized I r*eally, really* like him. But I've never held a proper conversation with him. I don't know how to approach him and start up a conversation, because I can't talk properly with him without blushing uncontrollably or tripping over my words. Helpp..
