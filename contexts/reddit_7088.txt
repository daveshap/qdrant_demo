Start up decision
I am currently being offered a position in a major metro with a west coast based startup. They're established in a few other large metros and are rolling out in my city. I would be in charge of helping with the roll out and hiring a team to work on site here. I am on the east coast.

I currently have a fairly cushy job that pays okay. The pay would be a slight cut to move to the startup, but more upside. I work 9-5 now and don't have to worry about my job after work or on the weekends. The new job would likely be 9-5 but much farther away, and probably more work answering phone calls/emails on the weekends and after hours.

Does anyone have any experience moving to a start up after leaving an easy office job that can shed some light on pros and cons? I would be happy to provide details in PM if anyone is willing to help. Thank you.
