MARGO: Would you like a drink? It's right beside you...
KAREN: I was telling Margo and Lloyd about how often you'd seen the play...
EVE: No, thank you. Yes. I've seen every performance.
LLOYD: Every performance? Then - am I safe in assuming you like it?
EVE: I'd like anything Miss Channing played...
MARGO: Would you, really? How sweet-
LLOYD: I doubt very much that you'd like her in 'The Hairy Ape'.
EVE: Please, don't misunderstand me, Mr. Richards. I think that part of Miss Channing's greatness lies in her ability to choose the best plays... your new play is for Miss Channing, isn't it, Mr. Richards?
MARGO: Of course it is.
LLOYD: How'd hear about it?
EVE: There was an item in the Times. i like the title. 'Footsteps on the Ceiling'.
LLOYD: Let's get back to this one. Have you really seen every performance? Why? I'm curious...
EVE: Well. If I didn't come to see the play, I wouldn't have anywhere else to go.
MARGO: There are other plays...
EVE: Not with you in them. Not by Mr. Richards...
