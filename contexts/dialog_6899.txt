OLIVER: I'd hate her to grow up like that.
ALICE: She's not Irena's child -- there's nothing of Irena in her. She's my child.
OLIVER: All I have to do is look at Amy's eyes, blue and deep like yours.
ALICE: I'm not a jealous woman, Oliver.
OLIVER: I know that.
ALICE: That's why I can tell you, straight out, you think too much about Irena -- blame yourself for her death. And its your thinking and brooding about her that makes you so unnaturally concerned about Amy.
OLIVER: No. It's not that. It's because I know what can happen when people begin to lie to themselves -- imagine things. I love Amy too much to let her lose herself in a dream world where butterflies become pals. I saw what happened to Irena with her Cat People.
ALICE: I know, dear. I understand. But try to worry a little less about her -- be a little easier in your thinking. And especially today â€” let's forget about it. We want a really bang-up birthday party, don't we?
OLIVER: You make me sound like the father in East Lynne.""
ALICE: Darling, no father could be nicer to a child than you are to Amy.
MISS CALLAHAN: You'd better hurry. I've left Amy in the car and she's getting impatient. She tells me there's something especially important about a sixth birthday.
OLIVER: We'll see that she gets there in good time
ALICE: I'm so glad to have met you at last. You're just as nice as Amy told me you were. I hope you'll come to see us.
MISS CALLAHAN: I'd love to.
