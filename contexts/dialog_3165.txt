JENNIFER: Oh come on - the guy's going to be a creep. All Englishmen are ugly.
DAVID: What makes you say that?
JENNIFER: All the guys they claim are English to and good-looking like Dan Day- Lewis and Liam Neeson, turn out to be Irish. Even Anthony Hopkins is welsh. Prince Charles is so ugly they pay him two million bucks a year to stay indoors.
DAVID: Richard Burton was very good-looking.
JENNIFER: Welsh.
DAVID: Sean Connery.
ALISON: Scottish.
DAVID: Tom Jones?
JENNIFER: Welsh again.
DAVID: Okay, so the guy's gonna look like Meatloaf's backside. No-one's asking you to go to bed with him.
