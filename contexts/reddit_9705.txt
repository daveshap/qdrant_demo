Writing A Recommendation Letter Advice
Hello all!

A student recently reached out to me and asked me to write them a recommendation letter. I am more than happy to do this, but I realized I'm not sure what the norms are around my particular situation. I supervised this student while in grad school and since graduating, I am no longer with that institution/position. When doing this in the past, what have you all done in regard to letter head/signing the letter? Should I use my graduate position's letter head/title or should I use my current positions? 

Any advice would be helpful!
