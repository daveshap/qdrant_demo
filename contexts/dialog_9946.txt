CREATURE: Nice.
GRANDFATHER: The music? Or the fire?
GRANDFATHER: I'm glad you finally came to the door. A man shouldn't have to scurry in the shadows.
CREATURE: Better that way... for me.
GRANDFATHER: Why?
CREATURE: I'm... very, very ugly. People are afraid. Except you.
GRANDFATHER: It can't be as bad as that.
CREATURE: Worse.
