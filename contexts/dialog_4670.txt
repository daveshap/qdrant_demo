CONKLIN: What?
ZORN: Zurich police are looking for an American with a red bag. Apparently he put two cops in the hospital last night.
CONKLIN: What the fuck is he doing?
ZORN: Maybe it's a game. Maybe he's trying to send us a message.
CONKLIN: It doesn't matter now. We've just got to be the first ones there. Get everybody up. I want them all activated.
ZORN: All of them?
