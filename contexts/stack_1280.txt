Run conduit from exterior sconce We have a sconce on the outside of our brick house on a covered patio currently.  I would like to run conduit from it to allow us to place an exterior fan on the same covered porch.  My questions:1) Can I add an exterior junction box and run conduit from it (all surface mounted) to the new fan placement, 2) mount a new sconce on the junction box (hopefully covering most of the box)3) Mount the fan to a fan rated exterior junction box which will be flush mounted to the ceiling joist?I want to make sure this would be code and safety compliant.  Thank you.Elmo
