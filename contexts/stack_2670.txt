Install osgeo live package in existing Ubuntu? I am using Ubuntu. In my secondary computer I use Lubuntu based OSGEO-LIVE 12.0. OSGEO-LIVE is a great software when it comes to any GIS application and reduces tedious work of individual package installation. But I want to set up all the packages from OSGEO-live into my existing Ubuntu 18.4. Is there any way of doing this in bulk in short time?
