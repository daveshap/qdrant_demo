JOHN: Well, would you like to know who it was you were marrying?
ANN: Well, a tall handsome Ubangi, I suppose.
JOHN: No, not that bad. It was a fella that sends you flowers every day. Er, what's his name? Mr. Norton's nephew.
ANN: Ted Sheldon.
JOHN: Yeah, that's the one.
JOHN: But here's the funniest part of it all. I was the fella up there doing the marrying. You know, the Justice of the Peace or something . . .
ANN: You were? I thought you were chasing me?
JOHN: Well, yes, I was. But I was your father then, see? But the real me, John Doe, er, that is, Long John Willoughby, I was the fellow up there with the book. You know what I mean?
ANN: I guess so. Then what happened?
JOHN: Well, I took you across my knee and I started spanking you.
