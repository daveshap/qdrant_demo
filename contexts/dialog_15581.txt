TENZIN GYATSO: I ask them to stop, to lay down their guns.
LORD CHAMBERLAIN: The Khamba's gun is his most prized possession. I admire them so. They face a modern, well equipped army, and still, they fight.
LORD CHAMBERLAIN: Land reform is underway in Amdo. The large estates are being confiscated and redistributed. Landlords are being punished.
TENZIN GYATSO: A beggar can be called a landlord if he disapproves of the Chinese.
TENZIN GYATSO: I have always asked for plain information. Just the truth.
LORD CHAMBERLAIN: The Communists put their guns in the hands of the Khamba children and force the child to kill the parent. They have dropped bombs on the monastery of Lithang in Kham. It has been destroyed. Women and children, trying to escape from the fighting, have been shot with machine guns, fired from airplanes.
TENZIN GYATSO: The pursuit of non-violence. Very difficult.
LORD CHAMBERLAIN: Non-violence means co-operation when it is possible. Resistance, when it is not.
