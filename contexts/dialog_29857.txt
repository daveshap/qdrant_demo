COLE: GOOD LUCK, CHET. SAM, YOU STICK WITH CHET, HE'S GOT HIS OWN M.O. MODUS OPERANDI. YOU CAN REACH ME AT THE PHILADELPHIA OFFICES. I AM FLYING OUT TODAY.
DESMOND: Right, Gordon. We'll be in touch.
STANLEY: That was really something. That dancing girl. What did it mean?
DESMOND: Code. If you work with Gordon you learn that right away.
STANLEY: Code, I've heard a lot about this.
DESMOND: Sort of shorthand.
STANLEY: Shorthand. Really?
DESMOND: We're heading into a difficult situation.
STANLEY: How do you figure?
DESMOND: I'll explain it to you. Do you remember Lil's dance?
DESMOND: Lil was wearing a sour face.
STANLEY: What do you mean?
DESMOND: Her face had a sour look... that means we're going to have trouble with the local authorities. They are not going to be receptive to the FBI.
