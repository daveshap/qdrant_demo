Selected after only one interview, and I was told I was their first candidate?
I am a software engineer, and I was recently out of work for about 6 months after I was laid off until I got (and accepted) a job offer last week.  It's a contract position with a fairly well-known company.  I was told by the contracting company that I was their first candidate being interviewed, and I was chosen after just one (video) interview.  Initially they said there would be multiple rounds of interviews, so I was especially surprised to hear I was chosen after just the first interview.  I just started yesterday, but I am still surprised after looking for months and being rejected many times, sometimes after 2 interviews.  Should I feel something might be wrong that I was accepted so quickly?  
I'm not sure if it's imposter syndrome, as I have about 16 years of experience, and I'm sure I can pick up whatever skills I'm less familiar with that I'd need for this position.
