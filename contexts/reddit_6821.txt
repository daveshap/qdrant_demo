Recruiters Ghosting me after first response?
Recruiters contacting me as a good fit. External and in house human resources. It is to setup a call or answer a few questions through email.

I get completely ghosted after that. Is this normal? They don't respond. It is frustrating because they leading you on and then ghost after first or second email.
