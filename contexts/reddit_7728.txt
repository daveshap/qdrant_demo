Interview Follow up Advice
I'm wrapping up my PhD and looking for a postdoc to start in about 10 months. I am visiting a collaborator at a different institution and they introduced me to a faculty member and we had a 45 min. meeting I would describe as a casual interview (talked projects, asked about my research interests, showed me around, etc). I liked the lab and it is definitely a place I'd consider working.  

Now I'm struggling to decide how to follow up, just a thank you email, email+CV, or full blown cover letter-style email.

Any advice is appreciated.
