SINGLETON: Lonnegan's a fast egg, Henry. He's not gonna sit still for a standard play.
GONDORFF: Everybody'll sit still for somethin'. What did ya find out about the train, Eddie?
NILES: He's been taking the 8:10 Century Limited outa New York on Friday and getting in here early Saturday morning. He usually stays a day to check on his policy operations, and then flies back.
GONDORFF: Wonder why he doesn't fly both ways.
NILES: The porters say he runs a braced card game in one of the cars. $100 minimum, straight poker. Last time he pulled in here ten grand heavier than he left New York.
GONDORFF: Fancies himself a gambler, huh?
