Jobs That Don't Require You To Work After Hours At Home or Work on Days You Ars Supposed to be off?
I'm looking for a job where I can put in 8-10hrs of work per day 5 days a week. I don't want to be regularly expected to continue working in the evenings or on the weekends. 

For qualifications I have a Liberal Arts BA + Cashiering and Data Entry experience. 
(Not great I know. I have been planning on starting a Paralegal studies program this fall. But, I'm not totally sure that's what I want to do.)
