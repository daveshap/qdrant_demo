HARTMAN: No? Well -- Johnson, you're under arrest. You, too, Burns.
BURNS: Who's under arrest? You pimple-headed, square-toed spy -- do you realize what you're doing?
HARTMAN: I'll show you what I'm doing. Burns, you're guilty of obstructing justice and so is the Morning Post. I'm going to see that the Post is fined ten thousand dollars for this.
BURNS: You'll see nothing of the kind, Sheriff.
HARTMAN: We'll just start by impounding the Post property. Is that your desk?
HILDY: No!
BURNS: Yes! What are you afraid of Hildy? I dare him to move that desk out of here.
