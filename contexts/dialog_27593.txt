PETE: Bought the bottle, didn't I? To the United States of America. Long my she wave.
PETE: Thanks, Jerry. Tell me something.
JERRY: What.
PETE: You tight with J. Edgar Hoover?
JERRY: The G-man?
PETE: Zackly.
JERRY: Pete, if J. Edgar Hoover walked in here wearing a dress, I wouldn't know him.
PETE: Too bad. He says I'm a communist.
JERRY: You should watch what you say. You don't know who's listening.
PETE: You know I'm not a communist, don't you, Jer?
JERRY: Sure, I suppose. That why you're on a bender?
PETE: This is not a bender yet. This is the start of a bender. But I can see how you were confused, they look a lot alike.
JERRY: Pete... go home. Come on, I'll call that girlfriend of yours, what's her name... Sandy?
PETE: Sandra Sinclair.
JERRY: Gimmee her number, I'll have her pick you up.
PETE: Sandra Sinclair. Wanna know her real name? Bella Iskowitz. No one's who they really are, Jer. Everyone's someone else. Even you. Even me. Especially me. I'm Peter Appleton, the communist who's not really a communist.
JERRY: I wanna close up soon. C'mon, let's call her.
PETE: Nope. Can't. We're through.
JERRY: Then I'll call you a cab.
PETE: I'll save you the trouble. I'm a cab. There. Did it myself.
PETE: 'Sides, car's right outside. I'll be seein' ya, Jer.
JERRY: Pete...
