ADAM: Yes...what is it?
HOTEL MANAGER: I'm sorry Mr. Kesher, but there seems to be some problem concerning your credit card.
ADAM: ... What??
HOTEL MANAGER: The fact is Mr. Kesher a representative of your bank called us.
ADAM: How... how'd they know I was here?
HOTEL MANAGER: I don't know. All we do is take an impression of the credit card and until you check out it just sits in our files.
ADAM: So, what did they say?
HOTEL MANAGER: Well, Sir, I'm afraid they said you're overdrawn at your bank and your line of credit has been cancelled.
ADAM: Unbelievable. Look... here. I don't know what's going on. That's so much baloney. I've got enough cash for one night, okay?
HOTEL MANAGER: That's fine, Mr. Kesher. You can pay cash when you check out. I'm sorry. it was my duty to inform you.
ADAM: Fine. I'll check out in the morning.
HOTEL MANAGER: Have a good evening, Mr. Kesher.
ADAM: Someone's shut off my money!
CYNTHIA: I know. Where are you Adam?
ADAM: What do you mean you know"?"
CYNTHIA: Someone called me. When they couldn't get you they told me you were as good as broke. I didn't believe then, so I made some calls.
ADAM: And?
CYNTHIA: You're broke!
ADAM: But I'm not broke.
CYNTHIA: I know, but you're broke. Where are you?
ADAM: Beverly Hills Hotel. I've got enough cash in my pocket for one night.
CYNTHIA: Do you know somebody called the The Cowboy?
ADAM: The Cowboy??
CYNTHIA: Yeah, the Cowboy. This guy, the Cowboy, wants to see you. Jason said he thought it would be a good idea.
ADAM: Oh, Jason thought it would be a good idea for me to meet the Cowboy. Should I wear my ten gallon hat and my six shooters?
CYNTHIA: Something tells me this guy is connected with what's happening, Adam, and I think you should do it and I think you should do it right away.
ADAM: Cynthia...what's going on?
CYNTHIA: It's been a very strange day.
ADAM: And getting stranger. Where do I meet this Cowboy? I mean do I have to ride out to the range?
CYNTHIA: Sort of, funny boy. If I tell him the meeting's on you're to go to the top of Beachwood Canyon. There's a corral up there where he'll be.
ADAM: You gotta be kidding?
CYNTHIA: Will you meet with him?
ADAM: Yeah, sure. It is that kind of a day. When?
CYNTHIA: I'll call him, then call you back...If you want you could stay at my place.
ADAM: Cynthia... that would not be a good idea.
CYNTHIA: I'm just offering a place to stay.
ADAM: I understand, Cynthia and thank you for the offer. I'll find a place. Now go ahead and give the Cowboy a yodel and get back to me.
CYNTHIA: Okay, but you don't know what you're missing.
ADAM: Git along little dowgie and call me back.
COWBOY: Howdy!
ADAM: Howdy to you.
COWBOY: Beautiful night.
ADAM: Yeah.
COWBOY: Sure want to thank ya for drivin' all the way up to see me from that Beverly Hills Hotel.
ADAM: No problem. What's on your mind?
COWBOY: Well now, here's a man who wants to get right to it. Kinda anxious to get to it are ya?
ADAM: Whatever.
COWBOY: A man's attitude ... a man's attitude goes some ways toward how a man's life will be. Is that somethin' you agree with?
ADAM: Sure.
COWBOY: Now... did you answer cause you thought that's what I wanted to hear or did you think about what I said and answer cause you truly believe that to be right?
ADAM: I agree with what you said...truly.
COWBOY: What did I say?
ADAM: That a man's attitude determines to a large extent how his life will be.
COWBOY: So since you agree I guess you could be a person who does not care about the good life.
ADAM: How's that?
COWBOY: Well, just stop for a little second and think about it. Will ya do that for me?
ADAM: Okay, I'm thinking.
COWBOY: No. You're too busy being a smart aleck to be thinkin'. Now I want ya to think and quit bein' such a smart aleck. Can ya do that for me?
ADAM: Look ... where's this going? What do you want me to do?
COWBOY: There's sometimes a buggy. How many drivers does a buggy have?
ADAM: One.
COWBOY: So let's just say I'm drivin' this buggy and you fix your attitude and you can ride along with me.
ADAM: Okay.
COWBOY: Now I know a few things. I know you have had a rough day. You're probably thinkin' I don't know the half of it, but in actual fact I know every part of it. The business of gittin' thrown off your movie, the heartache of seeing your wife with another man... losin' access to that precious film vault...
ADAM: It will work out.
COWBOY: Good then, but, just in case, that bank's gonna stay closed a bit longer. You understand that?
ADAM: I understand.
COWBOY: You're an understandin' fella.
ADAM: So, this is the last time I see you then unless I do bad?
COWBOY: No, this one doesn't count. It's part of the original one. So then ... until we meet again.
ADAM: Okay.
BETTY: You're still here?""
RITA: I came back. I thought that's what you wanted.""
