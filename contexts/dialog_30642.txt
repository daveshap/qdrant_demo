DIXON: ...this guy who said he was from the Security Exchange Commission, whatever the hell that is, calls and wants to ask me about that stock I bought...
BUD: What'd you tell him?
DIXON: I told him I was in the bathroom and I'd call him right back. What the hell was I supposed to say Buddy, you got me into...
BUD: Look Dixon, calm down! It's not illegal to buy stock or to be right. And it's not all that unusual to be spot checked on a big buy. Tell him you did your homework and you thought the stock was a sound investment.
DIXON: What if he asks where I got the money?
BUD: Tell 'em your father gave it to you.
DIXON: What if they call him?
BUD: They won't. That's not their jurisdiction.
DIXON: You sure?
BUD: Yes! Read the Constitution, it's all in there. And remember--you don't know anything, nothing.
DIXON: I don't know anything!
BUD: Good. Then call him back. And call me back. Don't worry.
MARV: Hey you hear the news. I just got a job at a new firm: Dewey
BUD: Didn't I tell you to knock before you came in here?
MARV: Hey the door was open.
BUD: Then get out and close it behind you.
MARV: You know what you need, buddy buddy--an optorectomy. That's when they cut the nerve that runs from your brain to your rectum--to change that shitty attitude of yours.
BUD: Get the hell out!
BUD: So what's the problem?
ROGER: ...got a strange call from the SEC. They asked to see my records... Bud, this is a heavy...
BUD: ....Relax Roget You're 82M in the account numbers and I'm the Invisible Man... they're always looking for red flags, Gekko's always getting checked by them, they never come up with anything... we're invulnerable on this...
ROGER: Alright... I just wanna slow down Bud... no more calls for awhile, no lunches... we suspend our business, alright...
BUD: Sure Roger, whatever you want, it's cool.
