LOEW: It's okay. These are police. <u>What</u> do you want?
EXLEY: I want D.A. bureau men to tail Dudley Smith twenty-four hours a day; I want you to get a judge to authorize a wire tap on his home phone; I want authorization to check his bank records and I want it all in an hour.
LOEW: On what evidence?
EXLEY: None. Call it a hunch.
LOEW: Absolutely not. Dudley Smith is a highly decorated member of this city's police department and I won't smear his name without --
EXLEY: Without what, his smearing yours first? What's he got on you, Loew? Pictures of you and an out of work actor with your pants down?
LOEW: Do you have any proof?
EXLEY: The proof had his throat slit. So far you're not denying it.
LOEW: I'm not going to dignify youwith answers. If you'll excuse me, I've got a Jack Vincennes press conference to prepare for.
