MIMI: Clyde Wynant's crazy... absolutely crazy to stay away at a time like this. No wonder the police think he has something to do with it.
NICK: What do you think?
MIMI: Oh, I know he didn't, but I wish I could find him... I have something very important to tell him. Macaulay won't help at all. He thinks I just want money.
NICK: Well, don't you?
MIMI: You're always teasing.
