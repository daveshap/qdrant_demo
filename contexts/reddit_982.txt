Does anyone else's stomach get messed up by anxiety?
I've been crazy stressed this week and have been getting a lot of stomach aches. Then last night, these awful stomach cramps started and they still haven't gone away. At this point I'm honestly not sure if it's anxiety or if I'm constipated lol. Though I'm more inclined to say it's anxiety because the pain seems to vanish the moment I stop feeling anxious, and then comes back when I start thinking about it again. No fun :(
