Career existential crisis thread: Any STEM PhD students completely uninterested in doing a postdoc? What are your career goals? How are you setting/have you set yourself up for success? Those who have started your careers, what did you do during grad school that helped?
I'm a 5th year and I am just so uninterested in doing any form of academic research after grad school. I hate how biased research is, how results are so fickle and most data out there isn't even reproducible, and how slow and unfulfilling it feels. I don't hate my research topic personally, but I'm definitely just doing it because it's my job at this point. I'm pretty much just trying to finish my program to get the Ph.D. and start my career.

Personally, I'm extremely interested in teaching, and education has always been a huge interest of mine. I want to be a professor so badly, but I don't want to run a lab or have to do research on the side. I love working with students and have a lot of experience in that. I honestly want to be a full-time faculty member at a community college or smaller school and teach a few courses every quarter/semester. That sounds incredible to me and like a dream come true! I feel like it's so taboo to even say that in grad school.

There are a few other career options I'm considering, but I would like to hear from y'all about your experiences! I don't even care about making a ton of money - I just want to be happy and do something I can enjoy doing without putting in too much more than 40 hours a week.

Those of you who have not done a postdoc, or aren't considering doing one, what are you interested in doing after grad school or have done after grad school? What are some things you did during grad school that helped you get your first position? What do you consider to be invaluable traits or skills for the career you got into?
