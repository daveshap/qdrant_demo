Anyone wish they would get hit by a car or bus or get an incurable cancer, instead of the stigma their family would receive from suicide.
I wish I got hit by a car or bus or got some incurable disease to die. I truly wish somebody facing death from a disease could have my body so that they could use it well and develop friends and relationships and spend time with their family and pursue their dreams. Trade me please, I know what I would be walking into and wouldn’t regret a thing. 

I don’t want my family to receive the stigma from my suicide. People will think they have failed me or that our family is broken. It’s not true, it’s me and my fault. 
People can say you’ll be dead so why would you care. Truth is we don’t know for sure what happens after death.
