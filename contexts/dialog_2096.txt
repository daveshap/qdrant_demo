RATH: Good afternoon. We have reservations at the Hotel Paraiso in Costa Blanca.
CABBY: Yes, sir.
RATH: No, no. I said the Hotel Paraiso.
CABBY: Yes. This is the Hotel Paraiso.
RATH: No, the other Hotel Paraiso, in the city. Near the Plaza del Sol.
CABBY: I'm sorry, sir. A year ago there was a fire in the old Hotel Paraiso. This is the new Hotel Paraiso.
RATH: Take us there.
