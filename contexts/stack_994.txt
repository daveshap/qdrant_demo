Upgrade to 18.04 using Ubuntu wiki I would like to try MythTV but first it seems that I ought to upgrade from 16.04 to 18.04. Using Ubuntu wiki BionicBeaver/ReleaseNotes\".  The first step says that I should open the \"Software &amp; Updates\" Setting in System Setting but I can find no \"Software &amp; Updates\" in system Settings.  Is there a way around this.  There seem to be many sources for this information, all a little different.  I assumed the Ubuntu wiki would be the best curated (close to the source).  Is this so?  Can anyone recommend a more reliable way to upgrade.
