12 years...
Entire life changed in 24 hours. My loving wife and I agreed to a divorce after 12 years. I stopped being the man she fell in love with. I never knew why. And it’s absolutely amazing how I can see every single detail why after I left that house. Last Saturday. Scared, depressed and lonely. We never had counseling and this is the first time I have been away from her in 12 years. I’m refraining from pouring my guts out to her, I know that she needs her space. I understand that. I’m praying that she sees hope for us yet like I do. I actually scheduled online counseling for myself. I have to be fixed for her first if she ever wants to try and work things out. That’s all I want right now...is to be back with her. I haven’t felt pain like this...ever. That’s how I know I love her, and she loves me, she said that right before I left with a huge hug...
