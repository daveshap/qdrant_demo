WOMAN: Where did you learn to fight like that? JIM I read a book.
WOMAN: Well, you saved me from a bad situation. Thanks. I admit this is...unusual.
JIM: Are you a regular there?
WOMAN: Are you serious? My boyfriend ditched me...
JIM: Ditched you?
WOMAN: We were fighting - I told him to let me out. So where are you headed?
JIM: Bartender said there are motels south of here.
