ZUZU: Ford, you were right!
FORD: Ye-ah.
GRENDEL: Actually you're a bit off in the motivation department... I mean, revenge is so... Bronson. Wait, where's the third C.D.? How could you come here without proof? It's a three piece set here! A computer disc from Colleen, Bobby's computer disc, and Johnny's computer disc. Together they make, oh fucking forget it!
FORD: Yeah, yeah, I know the third one unscrambles the high bits and the low bits. Shit, just start torturing me, man. I didn't even know Johnny had a disc and I can't deal with any 'Don't play games with me, Mr. Fairlane' bullshit.
GRENDEL: Don't play games... ugh. Did you say you don't have the third... ugh. I'm not going to torture <u>you</u>, Ford.
