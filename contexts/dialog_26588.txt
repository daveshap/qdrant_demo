LOW: When I was at the rest stop, there was a young boy, maybe ten, and his mother. Darryl Hawkins, Zero, abducted the boy in the men's room. I tried to stop him. He cold-cocked me --
KOESSLER: Listen to this guy? Can you believe this? He'll never change. Born a liar, first word out of his mouth was a lie. Make up a story, always a story, any goddamn story, to save his ass.
LOW: Agent Kulok, that boy, as we speak, is in Hawkins' truck, probably still alive, in a dark refrigerated compartment, shivering in just a T- shirt: put yourself in his mind, freezing, terrified, wanting his mother. Put yourself in his mother's place, desperate, imagining the worst is happening as she pleads, back there at the rest stop, for someone, anyone, to listen to her. This is not hypothetical, this is real. It is happening now and you can do something about it.
KOESSLER: Shut the fuck up or I'll shut you up.
LOW: You have to save this boy. Good exists in this world. I can prove it because you can, in your life, save this one person.
KULOK: Deputy Director, get out, sir.
KOESSLER: What are you doing?
KULOK: Please.
KOESSLER: Mackelway, I could understand. He is over-emotional by nature, but you, Agent Kulok, you had a shining career in front of you.
KULOK: Just step outside, sir. Now. Keep your hands where I can see them.
