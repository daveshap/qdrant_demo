RUTH: So, Miles. If you have a proposal, let's hear it.
MILES: At this point my client is still prepared to consider reconciliation.
RUTH: My client has ruled that out.
MILES: My client is prepared to entertain an amicable dissolution of the marriage without prejudice.
RUTH: That's delusional.
MILES: My client proposes a thirty day cooling off period.
RUTH: My client feels sufficiently dispassionate.
MILES: My client asks that you not initiate proceedings pending his setting certain affairs in order.
RUTH: Ha Ha.
MILES: Heh heh.
