Almost there... but very SLOW recruiter
I have a return offer with a company I did very well at as an intern.

My start date is in a couple days and I still have not gotten to finish their onboarding process or drug test. I have been emailing my recruiter about once a week for updates and he seems to be going at a snail's pace. Since until last week, he kept pushing the date (I'll get it to you by July, I'll get it to you by start of August, I'll get it to you by next week, etc.) and finally sent me the internal job application I could apply to so they could send me the appropriate steps to finish. However he went MIA again for 3 days when my start date is in 3 business days.. he hasn't responded to my email since and I'm wondering what to do now. Granted his average response time in the past has been probably 3-5 business days (still extremely slow) but given the time constraints we have now I thought 3 was still pretty long. I only have his e-mail and not phone number.

I do have the e-mail of my direct supervisor and the email/phone of the recruiter's direct supervisor (head recruiter). Should I contact my manager and cc the recruiter? Or is that a nono? I want to convey the urgency I have while not making it seem like I'm being rude/calling someone out. Any help would be appreciated as this process has been frustratingly and needlessly last minute.
