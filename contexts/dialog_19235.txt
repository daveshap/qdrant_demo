DUFF: How come you don't hate their guts?
JOSIE: I don't know. I guess I'm not afraid of them.
DUFF: You were plenty scared that night in the car.
JOSIE: Just of getting hurt. They can't touch me inside.
DUFF: Like hell they can't. They can reach right in with their damn white hands and turn you off and on.
JOSIE: Not if you see them for what they are, Duff.
DUFF: Jesus, baby, you're so full of talk! Well, you ain't never really been a nigger, have you - livin' like that in your father's house! So just shut your mouth.
DUFF: That's two bucks, Joe.
JOE: Why don't you come over for a beer when you get through?
DUFF: Okay, I will.
