WELL-MANICURED MAN: Our vaccine may have no effect!
STRUGHOLD: Well, without a cure for the virus, we're nothing more than digestives anyway.
WELL-MANICURED MAN: My lateness may have well been absence. A course has already been taken.
CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: There are complications.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: Mulder was in Dallas when we were trying to dispose of evidence. He's gone back there again. Someone has tipped him.
WELL-MANICURED MAN: Who?
CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: Kurtzweil, we think.

WELL-MANICURED MAN: No one believes Kurtzweil or his books. He's a toiler. A crank.
STRUGHOLD: And Mulder?
