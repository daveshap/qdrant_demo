make schengen visa outside your origin country/homeland hello i want to ask question about schengen visa, and i'm from Indonesia. My problem is i have plan to go flight to Romania on June for an exchange program purpose, and the romania visa is being processed now. But also i want to go to Schengen Area(germany, france, netherlands) but my concern is that i might not make time for applying schengen visa in my country before my departure time to Romania. So my question is can i make the schengen visa outside of my origin country/homeland(indonesia) especially while i'm in Romania?FYI my first choice of schengen country is GermanyThank you..
