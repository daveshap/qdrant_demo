JACK: Are you cold?
DAVID: Yes.
JACK: Good.
DAVID: Jack.
JACK: David.
DAVID: You're not having a good time are you?
JACK: Oh, I don't know. I mean look around. Isn't this a fun place?
DAVID: Well, I like it here.
JACK: I'm sorry. Northern England first, Italy later.
DAVID: Right.
JACK: Do you think she'll meet me in Rome?
DAVID: I think Debbie Klein is a mediocre person with a good body.
JACK: Debbie is not mediocre and she has one of the great bodies of all time.
DAVID: She's a jerk.
JACK: You're talking about the woman I love.
DAVID: I'm talking about a girl you want to fuck, so give me a break.
JACK: Well, anyway, do you think she'll be there?
DAVID: I don't know.
JACK: Rendezvous in Rome starring Jack Goodman and Debbie Klein. The love affair that shocked Europe! See torrid lovemaking at its most explicit! See Jack and Debbie expose their lust in the sacred halls of the Vatican! Never has the screen dared...
DAVID: If you don't stop, I'm going to kill you.
JACK: I have to make love to her. It's very simple. She has no choice really.
DAVID: It just fascinates me that you can spend so much energy on someone so dull.
JACK: It is impossible for a body like that to be dull.
DAVID: We've known Debbie what, since the eighth grade? How many years of foreplay is that?
JACK: She says she 'likes me too much'.
JACK: The Slaughtered Lamb?
DAVID: Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed fox head on a spear as their symbol?
JACK: That's a wolf's head.
DAVID: Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed wolf's head on a spear as their symbol?
JACK: That's not a spear. It's a pike.
DAVID: A severed wolf's head on a pike as their symbol.
JACK: David, before we go in there I want you to know that - no matter what happens to us - it's your fault.
DAVID: I assume full responsibility.
JACK: Okay.
DAVID: Shall we?
DAVID: Hello.
JACK: Nice to see you.
