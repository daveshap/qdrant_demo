SMECKER: While Greenly's getting coffee, anybody else want anything?
GREENLY: Shit! Shit!
SMECKER: So Duffy, got any theories to go with that... tie.
DUFFY: These guys were pros. I think they were coming for one target, the fag man, he was the...
SMECKER: The what man?
DUFFY: The fat man.
SMECKER: Well, Freud was right. So you think they came for the fag man, huh? And what do you base this upon?

SMECKER: And the pennies?
DUFFY: New hitman wants to leave his mark
SMECKER: That's a possibility. Y'know you Boston cops are perking up. That's two sound theories in one day, neither of which deal with abnormally sized men. Another possibility is that they were placed there with religious intent.
DUFFY: Yeah. Some cultures still put pennies in the eyes of the dead, or silver.
SMECKER: The Greeks. The Italians.
DUFFY: The Sicilians.
