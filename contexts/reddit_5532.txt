Applying for jobs that require an Interim Secret or Top Secret Clearance
Ugh, there's this tech job I totally qualify for except- I dont have a current security clearance. I googled and found it could take up to more than a year to get a Top Secret clearance. Is this something I could do for myself? Are these jobs only applicable to those who are already working these DoD jobs? Will the employer get the clearance for me?
