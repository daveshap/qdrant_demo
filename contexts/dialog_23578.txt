JILL: There were some shots.
GEORGE: What're you talking about?
JILL: Gunshots, there were some gunshots.
GEORGE: Where?
JILL: Here in the canyon.
GEORGE: Well, it's a big canyon. Honey, I'm sorry but I've gotta get back... just for a minute.
JILL: Let me come, too. Please don't leave me alone.
GEORGE: What's gonna happen?
JILL: I don't know... every once in a while I just get the feeling something awful's going to happen.
GEORGE: Well, like what?
JILL: I don't know... just... somebody's going to get me.
JILL: I've had these dumb dreams lately.
GEORGE: What?
JILL: They're dumb, somebody... I don't know...
GEORGE: Who?
JILL: I just... who what?
GEORGE: You said somebody... who?
JILL: I don't know. I can't remember. It was just in my dream.
GEORGE: No shit?
GEORGE: Nobody's gonna get you. Now get inside.
JILL: George, I don't --
GEORGE: You'll do what I tell you. Now get the fuck inside.
JILL: George --
GEORGE: Keep moving --
JILL: Now, George --
GEORGE: Nobody's gonna get you but me!
GEORGE: How are you, baby?
JILL: Fine. How are you?
GEORGE: Great, great, fantastic. Fantastic. Incredible. Incredible, really incredible.
JILL: What?
GEORGE: I'm gonna open the shop, baby, I'm gonna open the shop. I'm getting it together.
JILL: How?
GEORGE: Right now -- I'm at the epitome of my life. Right now I feel so good I'm afraid something's gonna happen.
GEORGE: When I was a little kid, I used to want to go to Europe but right now wherever I am I'm gonna be in Europe.
JILL: Honey, what happened?
GEORGE: I just came from a meeting... I can't talk about it now, baby. But in a few days -- see I'm disgusted with my life.
JILL: I thought you said you were at the epitome of your life.
GEORGE: I am, I am. But I've had it with chicks. They're like an occupational hazard. Six guys working for me... I'm gonna retire or settle down or something.
JILL: What about me?
GEORGE: You're different.
JILL: I am?
GEORGE: You're great.
JILL: I am?
GEORGE: Yeah.
JILL: Do you really mean that?
GEORGE: Hey, baby -- I'm gonna retire with you.
JILL: Honey?
GEORGE: Yeah, baby.
JILL: Why am I great?
