PATROL VOICE: 10-4, in a few minutes. He's down checking a buoy in the Bay Channel.
BRODY: Get him the hell over to Amity Point, the old lighthouse. Right now.
PATROL VOICE: What for?
BRODY: There's a bunch of Kids day-sailing that way. Turn them back to port.
PATROL VOICE: That's it?
BRODY: That's it. Just do it, all right?
PATROL VOICE: 10-4, soon as I can raise him.
BRODY: If they're not at the light, look for them. I don't want them out there. Get them back to port!
PATROL VOICE: Affirmative, affirmative. Turn the Kids day-sailing back to port. I heard you. Patrol out.
