If the unemployment rate is 3.6, why is it still so hard to get a job?
I always learned that the lower the unemployment rate the easier it was to find a job since so there are not so many people available to work. 

Today’s climate seems like it’s nearly impossible the get a job.  I applied for over 50 jobs and haven’t gotten one interview yet even though they are all in my industry. 

Can someone explain it to me? I thought I’d be flooded with interviews
