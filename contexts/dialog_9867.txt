FRANCES: It's already started, Dad... with me.
ERNEST: I know.
FRANCES: And I can't understand how it can hurt to be honest, but the more I tried to explain --
LILLIAN: Don't listen to him, little sister. When you're proud of what you are, you don't refuse the label, understand?
FRANCES: Yes, Ma.
LILLIAN: And you... should be proud. You won that contest and made a name for yourself.
LILLIAN: You're poisoning that child's mind.
ERNEST: I have a right to talk to her. She's my daughter, and she's beginning to understand why I've sacrificed so much in order to achieve...
LILLIAN: You've sacrificed?! If you'd practice law for decent folk instead of Communists and indigents --
ERNEST: They need help, Lil. They pay me back in other ways.
LILLIAN: How? What do they do for you, Kaminski and his friends? They're all anarchists! Traitors!
ERNEST: No, Lil. It's just you can't understand their brand of patriotism.
LILLIAN: That's right. I can't understand a man who puts strangers over his family, a man who gives up a good career to become a shiftless inkhorn failure.
ERNEST: I'm going back to the hotel.
LILLIAN: Good.
ERNEST: See you next weekend?
LILLIAN: As usual. Everything as usual, Mr. Farmer. Just give me my due.
ERNEST: Lillian... I'm more than willing to meet you halfway.
LILLIAN: Don't make me sick. I'd sooner drown myself in Puget Sound.
ERNEST: That's a thought, Lil. That sure is a thought.
