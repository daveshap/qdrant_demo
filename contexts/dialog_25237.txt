SPOCK: I do not understand the final question...
AMANDA: You are half human. The Computer knows that.
SPOCK: The question is irrelevant.
AMANDA: Spock... The retraining of your mind has been in the Vulcan way, so you may not understand feelings. But as my son, you have them. They will surface.
SPOCK: As you wish, since you deem them of value. But I cannot wait here to find them.
AMANDA: Where must you go?
SPOCK: To Earth. To offer testimony.
AMANDA: You do this -- for friendship?
SPOCK: I do this because I was there,
AMANDA: Spock. Does the good of the many outweigh the good of the one...?
SPOCK: I would accept that as an axiom.
AMANDA: Then you stand here alive because of a mistake -- made by your flawed, feeling, human friends. They have sacrificed their futures because they believed that the good of the <u>one</u> -- you -- was more important to them.
SPOCK: Humans make illogical decisions...
AMANDA: ... They do, indeed.
COUNCIL PRESIDENT: Status report, Admiral!
MORROW: Mr. President, the Probe has passed through all quadrants. The starships Shepard and Yorktown and three smaller vessels have been neutralized.
COUNCIL PRESIDENT: Neutralized?" How?"
MORROW: We don't know. It's using forms of energy our best scientists do not understand...
COUNCIL PRESIDENT: Can you protect us?
MORROW: We are launching everything we have.
