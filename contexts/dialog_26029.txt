MAX: Bobbyyyy! Tequila por favor! Double shots. Make it Tres Generaciones, huh. Nothin' but the best for my good friend Lenny, the finest cop that ever got thrown off the vice squad. Hey, nice tie.
LENNY: Thanks, Max.
MAX: D'you always have to dress like a fuckin' pimp?
LENNY: This tie cost more than your entire wardrobe.
MAX: That's not sayin' much.
LENNY: It's the one thing that stands between me and the jungle.
