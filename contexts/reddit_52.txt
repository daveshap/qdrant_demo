can i be friends with a recent friend with benefits?
so i (16 f) have hung out quite a bit with a guy (16 m), and we made out quite a lot over the summer, but we kind of fell apart and now we are just friends.
the thing is, a while ago he said to hang out as friends, and i was doubtful, but i agreed, because he’s a really cool guy, buuut let’s just say i don’t kiss my friends a lot.
now it has been some time since we last hung out (couple of months), and he keeps telling me we have to hang out, and he truly is just such a friendly nice guy, that i’d love to just hang out as friends, and nothing more, but i’m scared the same thing will happen again.
i’m very attracted to him, but i’m also terrified of him and how he makes me feel. i don’t feel ready for a relationship, but i’m aware that’s probably not what he’s looking for, he’s more experienced than i am, and i don’t have any reason to think he actually wants anything serious. but even if he doesn’t want a relationship, i feel like he might want “something” and i definitely don’t want that, because i’ll end up falling for him, and he also might only want to fuck which i don’t want to do with someone that isn’t my boyfriend (mostly a trust issue).
only other option, my favorite, is that he wants to be friends! my friends say im totally naive and there’s no way he just wants that, but he really is such a great guy :( i’d just love to hang out with him and more people so that im not as anxious about it :/
i’d love to hear anyone’s views on this :)
