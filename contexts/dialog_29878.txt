JAMES: Laura, do you love me?
LAURA: Yes, I love you. I've told you, but it doesn't really matter.
JAMES: Why? It does.
LAURA: No, it doesn't... just kiss me.
JAMES: It does matter. We're in love.
LAURA: James, you don't know what you are talking about. Quit trying to hold on so tight. I'm gone... long gone like a turkey through the corn.
JAMES: You're not a turkey. A turkey is one of the dumbest birds on earth.
LAURA: Gobble, gobble, gobble.
