Apply to multiple jobs in the same office or institution?
What are your thoughts on apply for multiple jobs at the same small institution? What about two jobs in the same office?

I am looking at two jobs in the same office. One AD job would be a slight stretch with my qualifications, the coordinator would be very similar to the position I am currently in.
