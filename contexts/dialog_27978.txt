J.D.: So how come you don't have any kids?
THELMA: Darryl, that's my husband, he says he's not ready. He's still too much of a kid himself. He prides himself on being infantile.
LOUISE: He's got a lot to be proud of.
THELMA: Louise and Darryl don't get along.
LOUISE: That's puttin' it mildly.
THELMA: She thinks he's a pig.
LOUISE: He's a real piece o' work. I wish you could meet him.
J.D.: Did you get married real young?
THELMA: Twenty-four isn't young. I'd already been goin' out with him ten years when we got married. I've never been with anybody but Darryl.
J.D.: Well, if you don't mind me sayin' so, he sounds like a real asshole.
THELMA: It's okay. He is an asshole. Most of the time I just let it slide.
