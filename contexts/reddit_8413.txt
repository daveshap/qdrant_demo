Should the United States allow foreign airlines to fly domestic routes?
Under U.S. law, foreign airlines are not allowed to fly routes within the United States. It's rare for any country to grant [these rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabotage). The recent situation with United had me wondering whether American travelers would be better served if foreign airlines could operate domestic routes. We only have three major airlines, which is hardly ideal competition. Thoughts?
