I think I fucked up the last 24 years of my life. Should I go back to get another degree?
I thought I always had everything in the bag. Graduate, go to law school, and then live an okay life. But as I worked an internship at a law office and was unable to take the LSAT this year (law school admission test) due to family reasons, I’m beginning to realise more and more that this may not be what I wanted.

Unfortunately, all the jobs I’ve been able to find with my useless BA degrees (Criminology/Film, God knows why) are in sales and marketing and that is definitely something I do not want to do for the rest of my life. It never actually occurred to me to try my hand at anything STEM related, but I’m beginning to think I should go back to school to get a BS instead. I literally have nothing else gunning for me except for some job experience (peer academic counselor) and good grades. It’s kind of depressing. I also have some stupid dream to work in the game industry someday and I’m nowhere near that at all. 

Thank you for reading and I would greatly appreciate any advice! I’m afraid of wasting the next few years of my life as well...or even the rest of my life in pursuit of something I may not even like in the end.
