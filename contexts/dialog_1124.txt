MOZART: Why what, sir?
COLLOREDO: Why do I have to be humiliated in front of my guests by one of my own servants?
MOZART: Humiliated?
COLLOREDO: How much provocation am I to endure from you? The more license I allow you, the more you take.
MOZART: If His Grace is not satisfied with me, he can dismiss me.
COLLOREDO: I wish you to return immediately to Salzburg. Your father is waiting for you there patiently. I will speak to you further when I come.
MOZART: No, Your Grace! I mean with all humility, no. I would rather you dismissed me. It's obvious I don't satisfy.
COLLOREDO: Then try harder, Mozart. I have no intention of dismissing you. You will remain in my service and learn your place. Go now.
