JOHNSON: You got a lot of guts calling me.
CARTER: Yes I do. That's all I got. Guts and you, Johnson. There's no one else I can trust.
JOHNSON: You made a fool out of me! In front of the FBI!
CARTER: Listen, this ain't about us! It's about a thirteen year old girl. She's not gonna make it. Unless we do something.
JOHNSON: Jesus...what do you want?
CARTER: This whole thing is goin' down tonight. I need to know where the Ambassador is gonna be. The Feds will be keepin' a lid on everything. You thing you can do that?
JOHNSON: This is my city. I'm a cop. I'll find Å’em.
CARTER: Alright, Johnson, thank you. So...what are you wearing?
LEE: What are you doing here?
CARTER: Well, I ain't goin' to China. And neither are you.
