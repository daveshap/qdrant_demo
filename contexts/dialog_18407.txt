JEFFERSON: What do they--? Who are all those--?
SAUNDERS: One of the plagues on members of Congress--office-seekers, cranks, people with pet bills. Get my son into West Point--or *outta* West Point. I've got a scheme to put people to work.

JEFFERSON: No--not today! Boy, I feel like a house afire! Saunders--how did I do?
SAUNDERS: Great.
JEFFERSON: I--I don't know how I got it out. My heart was right up here all the time-- I wonder what Senator Paine thought of it?

SAUNDERS: Thanks a lot.
JEFFERSON: Oh--*Saunders*!
JEFFERSON: I--I--gee whiz--I didn't thank you!
SAUNDERS: Don't mention it--
JEFFERSON: I mean it. I--without you, I could't've--
