GALLAGHER: What is it? I'm about to go on.
WADE: We have to talk.
GALLAGHER: I heard about today. Good job. I'm all for capital punishment. Why don't you go home and see your family?
WADE: That wasn't your plan, was it?
GALLAGHER: What are you talking about?
WADE: You were planning to send me back to the ice house. You set me up.
GALLAGHER: You're crazy.
WADE: <u>You</u> were the dirty cop... and I was on to you. You panicked. Afraid I was going to expose you... so you shut me up.
GALLAGHER: I don't want to hear anymore.
WADE: You stole the heroin out of the evidence room and planted it on me. I was iced. What better way to keep me from talking. Stop me if I'm wrong.
GALLAGHER: You have no evidence. Arrest this man.
SANCHEZ: You want evidence. I'll give you evidence.
DUBBS: It was Wade's old partner... Gallagher. He was behind it all.
SANCHEZ: Put that on your political resume.
PEEBLES: Sir---
GALLAGHER: Shut up! Drop it.
