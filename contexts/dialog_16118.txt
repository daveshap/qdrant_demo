GEORGE: I was up on the roof this morning, tearing it down and it struck me as strong as anything ever has. That I'm happy today.
ROBIN: What have you been before today?
GEORGE: It was just that, maybe the way the sun struck the ocean, the sound of the waves. It was simple, whatever it was. Then I started thinking about the last time I felt this good. It's been a long time.
ROBIN: Do you remember?
GEORGE: The only time I can think of for sure, I was holding onto Sam in the ocean, saving him from the waves.
GEORGE: You head was pressed against my chest. I could feel your heart racing. And I remember I kissed your hair.
ROBIN: We have it on video! Was that when? My parents were down for his sixth birthday! I remember that.
