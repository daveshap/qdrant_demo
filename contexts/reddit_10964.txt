I told my husband.
I told my husband I was suicidal as expected he cried and got upset. He made me promise not to leave him. I promised him. I feel good finally asking for help, now that's it's the new year and I have health insurance I can finally get the medicine I need. Plus I had a job interview this morning that was pretty promising. Who knows maybe 2017 is the year everything turns around for me. I have a good feeling about this year. 

Sorry if this isn't the right spot for it. I just felt like I needed to share with someone. Since it was the topic of suicide I figured this was the place to post it.

Hang in there everybody.
