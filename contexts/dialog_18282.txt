ROSE: He doesn't like you. Thank you for answering my question.
MR. JOHNNY: You don't know where Loretta is?
ROSE: No idea.
MR. JOHNNY: Then tell her I'll come by in the morning. We need to talk.
ROSE: Okay, I'll tell her.
ROSE: What the hell happened to you?
LORETTA: Well. I don't really know where to start.
ROSE: Your hair's different.
LORETTA: Everything's different.
ROSE: Are you drunk?
LORETTA: No. Are you drunk?
ROSE: No. But I have a hangover.
LORETTA: Where's pop?
ROSE: Upstairs. Johnny Cammareri showed up last night.
LORETTA: What? He's in Sicily!
ROSE: No more he's not.
LORETTA: He's with his dying mother!
ROSE: She recovered.
LORETTA: WHAT!! She was dying!
ROSE: It was a miracle.
LORETTA: A miracle? This is modern times! There ain't supposed to be miracles any more!
ROSE: I guess it ain't modern times in Sicily. He came right from the airport. He wanted to talk to you. You got a love bite on your neck. He's coming back this morning.
