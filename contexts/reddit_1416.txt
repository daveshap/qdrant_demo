Friendly reminder to anyone in the the US (yes this includes cali and florida, you're not exempt): if you have anxiety or depression, this is the time to get tested for low vitamin d and possibly start supplements. Winter blues are upon us folks
Winter blues and seasonal depression can make anxiety much worse. So its worth it to go get tested for low levels which is very common. And its recommend to take up to 5000iu of D3. NOT D2.
