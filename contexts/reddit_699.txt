Boyfriend v. Friend issues
So here’s the thing. At the beginning of knowing my boyfriend i HATED him. Some of my friends were in relations to him despite my hatred. One of these friends, (Kaitlyn) had a HUGE crush on him. So much so, she continually “touched herself” to the thought of him to supposedly “get him of her head”. This occurred last year, My boyfriend and i are amazing together and he even distanced himself away from him after she tried to “cancel” me. By the power of having mutual friends we ourselves are forced to be nice to each other now.  Although this is old news, you can tell shes still has obsessive thoughts about him. Recently this was all brought to my attention and i confronted her telling her i deserved an apology. She of course refused. What can i do? All of my friends love her despite her manipulative ways.
