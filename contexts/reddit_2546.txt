Am I wrong to want a job with decent vacation?
I'm in the USA and we're known for our lack of vacation time. However, at my old job I had 2 weeks of paid vacation, and next summer I would have been entitled for 3 weeks paid. I had been with them for 4 years and got an extra week for each year I was there.

But my new job is only 2 days of vacation for a whole year, which is awful. I enjoy traveling and 2 days does not fit my needs. Am I wrong for wanting a job to give me a proper vacation in my first year? I don't agree with having to "earn" it, I think that's silly. I've worked long enough and it sucks you start all over again when you begin a new job.

I am looking for another job even though I've only been at this one for 2 months. It's a lot more serious things than vacation pushing me away though. It's just one more thing added to the pile of negatives. I wouldn't have left my old job if it wasn't for a nasty colleague who was never disciplined.
