DODGE: Probably slipped her moorings, got tangled up in a current.
EPPS: Out here? What, so a seven hundred foot passenger liner drifted out of Spokane harbor and nobody managed to bump into her until now?
DODGE: Somebody's probably looking for her as we speak.
MURPHY: Whatever the reason, she's adrift and abandoned. We've got every right to salvage her.
GREER: You mean tow her back? That's a thirty thousand ton ship you're talking about.
MURPHY: We've done it before.
DODGE: Yeah, from one side of the harbor to the other. But we got half the Bering Sea and the whole Alaskan gulf to drag her over.
MURPHY: You have any idea how much a ship like that could be worth in salvage? The fittings alone could go for a few million.
DODGE: If you get it back in one piece.
MURPHY: It's a risk I'm willing to take.
GREER: All we got to do is hit some rough weather and you can forget about it.
MURPHY: So we cut her loose and wait it out. A little weather couldn't be anything she hasn't seen before.
DODGE: It's a bloody navigation hazard. One boat can't control a ship that size.
MURPHY: The damn thing's been floating around for God knows how long and it hasn't hit anything yet. So we take it easy. A little of the old push pull.
