KEVIN'S BROTHER: Try the spicy tuna hand roll.
KEVIN: What?! How do I do that?
KEVIN'S BROTHER: Uh -- forget that. Look, is that all you're interested in? Ways to get your girlfriend into bed?
KEVIN: Well, no. I think...I guess it would be good to be able to return the favor. I mean, it would be nice to know she enjoys things as much as I do.
KEVIN'S BROTHER: That's good, that's what I needed to hear. Now you qualify.
KEVIN: Qualify for what?
KEVIN'S BROTHER: You've just inherited The Bible.
