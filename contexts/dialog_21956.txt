JIM: You still pretty upset?
JUDY: I'm numb.
JIM: You cold?
JUDY: Even if I'm near a fire, I'm cold. I guess just about everybody's cold.
JIM: I swear, sometimes, you just want to hold onto somebody! Judy, what am I going to do? I can't go home again.
JUDY: Neither can I.
JIM: No? Why not? You know something? Sometimes I figure I'll never live to see my next birthday. Isn't that dumb?
JUDY: No.
JIM: Every day I look in the mirror and say, What? You still here?" Man!"
