SHEP: Nope.
MARGE: Well, you do reside their at 1425 Fremont Terrace?
SHEP: Yep.
MARGE: Anyone else residing there?
SHEP: Nope.
MARGE: Well, Mr. Proudfoot, this call came in past three in the morning. It's just hard for me to believe you can't remember anyone calling.
MARGE: ...Now, I know you've had some problems, struggling with the narcotics, some other entanglements, currently on parole -
SHEP: So?
MARGE: Well, associating with criminals, if you're the one they talked to, that right there would be a violation of your parole and would end with you back in Stillwater.
SHEP: Uh-huh.
MARGE: Now, I saw some rough stuff on your priors, but nothing in the nature of a homicide...
MARGE: ...I know you don't want to be an accessory to something like that.
SHEP: Nope.
MARGE: So you think you might remember who those folks were who called ya?
MARGE: Mr. Lundegaard?
JERRY: Huh? Yah?
MARGE: I wonder if I could take just a minute of your time here -
JERRY: What... What is it all about?
MARGE: Huh? Do you mind if I sit down - I'm carrying quite a load here.
MARGE: ...You're the owner here, Mr. Lundegaard?
JERRY: Naw, I... Executive Sales Manager.
MARGE: Well, you can help me. My name's Marge Gunderson -
JERRY: My father-in-law, he's the owner.
MARGE: Uh-huh. Well, I'm a police officer from up Brainerd investigating some malfeasance and I was just wondering if you've had any new vehicles stolen off the lot in the past couple of weeks - specifically a tan Cutlass Ciera?
MARGE: ...Mr. Lundegaard?
JERRY: ...Brainerd?
MARGE: Yah. Yah. Home a Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox.
JERRY: ...Babe the Blue Ox?
MARGE: Yah, ya know we've got the big statue there. So you haven't had any vehicles go missing, then?
JERRY: No. No, ma'am.
MARGE: Okey-dokey, thanks a bunch. I'll let you get back to your paperwork, then.
