UCLA is handing out 97,000 Ls tomorrow
There's been all this talk about UCLA handing out Ls lately, so I did a little digging. They accepted 16,456 students last year; if we assume they accept the same number this year, then out of the total pool of 113,409 applicants, there will be a grand total of 96,953 Ls handed out tomorrow (or whenever they release). 


We've gotten to a point where a school is handing out ~100k Ls. That's a lot of Ls, almost too many Ls if you ask me. And yeah, I mean there's the waitlist too, but I'm taking that as an L if I don't get straight in. Now I know other schools hand out more Ls percentage wise because their acceptance rates are lower and yields are higher (and not everyone applies), but they don't receive the kind of volume in applications that the UCs do. So it's interesting to see the sheer quantity of Ls we're dealing with. UCLA handing out 100k Ls means...


- 85.5% of applicants will receive an L 


- Only 1 out of every 7 students won't receive an L tomorrow


- Only 14.5% will receive that coveted W


- There are 17 countries or territories with populations smaller than the number of Ls UCLA is handing out tomorrow, a few of these places are Greenland, Cayman Islands, and Bermuda. Essentially, it would be like UCLA rejecting the entire of country of Seychelles, an island country East of Africa - Population 94,677, and then some. Imagine seeing that on CNN.

- To visualize the impressive number of Ls, just take a look at this photo of a [Michigan football game](https://www.flickr.com/photos/upnorthmemories/2234177323); every person in that stadium represents an L from UCLA. 


- This means UCLA could fill the next Superbowl with nothing but the Ls they handed out and still have an overflow crowd to rival the total season attendance of last year's Cleveland Browns.

- There's 34,748 subscribers on this sub, which means UCLA could theoretically hand us all about 2.8 Ls if they wanted to. Not that they will, because I'm sure plenty of people on here won't be getting an L, but it does put into perspective the number of Ls that will be available and imminent during decision time. 


- UCLA will hand out just under the same number of Ls Harvard, Yale, and UC Hicago usually hand out... COMBINED.

- No other college in U.S. history has ever handed out so many Ls in a single year. 

- If you took a shot of tequila for every L UCLA handed out tomorrow you would be dead, like *really really* dead.

- All of this makes UCLA the most selective public university in the country, maybe even the whole world.


Lots of quick maths here, but I thought it'd be interesting to see the distribution of Ls handed out. 

Just remember that if you happen to catch an L tomorrow, you won't be alone. We are brothers and sisters in *ar.*.. *uhh*, I mean *Ls*. All 97,000 of us.


Anyway, good luck tomorrow everyone... and god speed. I hope you don't take that L from UCLA.
