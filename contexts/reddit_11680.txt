I think I might be depressed
Little things bother me to no end, my friends dont invite me to play a game and I immediately think they hate me, I leave a conversation and no one tries to talk to me and I think they hate me again,  I'm to nervous and anxious to talk to people and take steps to better myself, I've been told that I am just looking for a reason to moan whilst walking near a road and I considered jumping in front of a car but I know I'm to scared to do it. 

I have no idea who my friends are and I hate everything about my appearance. 

I don't enjoy most things any more and am always bored,  gaming which is something I have always used to take my mind off things is something that I get bored off immediately now

And yet I'm always told I'm the guy that's constantly smiling and blahblah

I'm also to scared to see a doctor or talk to people about how I'm feeling
