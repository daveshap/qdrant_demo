Graduating in 3 months and I don't know anything about finance
I'm a senior (philosophy and history major) at a decent college. I'm graduating in a few months and I don't know anything about personal finance (loans, mortgage, budgeting, credit etc). Is anyone in the same boat?

I wish I took a finance class but it's too late now. I know about the personal finance subreddit but there's way TOO much information. Does anyone know of a place where I can find CONCISE information (in layman's term please) regarding these things?
