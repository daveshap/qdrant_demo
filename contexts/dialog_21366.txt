SCHAEFER: Billy's on it. Heat seeker. Pretty sophisticated for half-asses mountain boys.
DILLON: They're getting better equipped every day.
BILLY: Major, looks like there were ten, maybe twelve guerrillas. Looks like they took some prisoners from the chopper. Then a different set of track, over there.
SCHAEFER: What do you mean?
BILLY: Six others, U.S. issue jungle boots. They came in from the north, then followed the guerrillas.
SCHAEFER: Mean anything to you?
DILLON: Probably another rebel patrol. They operate in here all the time.
