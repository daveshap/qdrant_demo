EDDIE: Where's Bert?
SARAH: He went off someplace.
EDDIE: Well, that old lovin' horse paid twenty-two forty. Let's see... two hundred I won from the jockey last night. And today at the track... I got five hundred and forty bucks. Here, you hold it.
SARAH: Why?
EDDIE: Just for luck.
BERT: Hey, Findley's here.
EDDIE: Where?
BERT: Over there by the bar.
EDDIE: Aren't you gonna go over and talk to him?
BERT: Nah. Sit tight. He'll be over here.
BERT: Are you ready for another?
SARAH: Thank you.
EDDIE: No, no more for me.
FINDLEY: Well, hello. Haven't seen you in a long time.
