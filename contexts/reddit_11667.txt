How can I find my people? I don't feel like belonging anywhere.
So the problem is that I've been noticing I have very little or sometimes nothing in common with the people I hang out with, especially at work. I am an intern at the company I work, so I hang out with other interns, but I feel like I have nothing in common with them AT ALL. They like to talk about parties, boys, relationships and I am not very interested in those subjects, and also they are very loud. I am very calm and quiet and a  few years older. there are actually some people I would like to hang out at work which I consider to be a little more calm and with different subjects to discuss, but I don't know how to approach them. I used to work with a few of them before but I always feel like I have nothing to say to them either. 
How do I find my people at work and also in life? I am very shy and introspective so it's really hard for me to start a conversation.
