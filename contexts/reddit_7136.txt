I recently got hired, did my paper work, but they haven't called me back.
Okay, I got hired by a popular clothing store last Monday. On Wendesday I went in and did the usual showing them two forms of ID, filled out my paperwork, and was told they would contact me in a couple of days with information on my employee ID number and a schedule. I still haven't heard back from them, tried calling and no one has picked up I kinda need to start working ASAP because of bills and food. I do have other offers lined up though, but had a good feelings about this company. What do I do or not do?
