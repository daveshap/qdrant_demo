Apparently, my college sent me the wrong decision letter. LMAO
A few weeks ago UMass Amherst accepted me into their CS program with a $16k scholarship, but no Honors college.

Today they sent me an email saying that they made an error regarding my Honors college decision and that I'm actually accepted. I didn't know colleges could send the wrong decision letter lmao
