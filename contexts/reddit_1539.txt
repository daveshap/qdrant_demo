Anxiety is having a multitude of people scream at you to move a pile of burning tires and you're sitting there begging them to wait until the tires aren't on fire anymore.
But the tires are never not-on fire, and the people never stop demanding that you move them and moving them is the hardest thing to do and you end up completely burnt and in pain, but when you're done, the people bitch about how the tires aren't in the right place and the pile isn't right and so you need to do it again. So you move the whole burning mess again and then you're nothing but a pile of ashes and your friends think you hate them because you didn't want to show up to the bar as a pile in a dustpan and try to pretend that you're still vaguely shaped like a person.

Then the next day you wake up and people start in with "Why are you being so lazy? You're just sitting there like a pile of dust." :(

(I've been on a panic attack for 4 hours now, and it's not going anywhere and every time I ask people to give me a minute, they go full "Friday Boss" mode and start yelling about how it needs to get done immediately and I just want to go into a cave and sleep for an entire week.)

Edit: Maybe not technically a 4 hour attack,  I don't really count 10-15 minute periods of normalcy an "end" to an attack in the beginning of another. Call it a 4 hour "chain" attack if that is a better wording to describe it
