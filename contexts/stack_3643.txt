How to control program permissions and resources in Windows Is it possible to set specific restrictions/permissions for a program(s) by using any software/feature on Windows? Preferably set before launch and preferably set using a single software/interface, like how android handles permissionsFor instance, deny program XYZ access to the internet, but not read/write files except in folder ABC. It would be great if it was also possible to set restrictions on resource usage as well (not more than 50% of total CPU, etc)Task Manager's process priorities is pretty good but not quite what I'm looking for
