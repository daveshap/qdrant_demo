Is there a job/career path that would allow me to work less hours and get paid less? Ultimately my goal is to work less than 40 a week, and I dont need much money.
Hello,

Currently a mechanical engineer with a bachelors. I hate 40 hour weeks. Its way too much. I still want to have some free time where I can continue to learn in.

Im currently looking into going into a new career. What kind of careers have options to work less hours, and get less pay that of course should come with less hours? My problem is, nearly all jobs seem to be 'all or nothing'. 40 hours, or 0. I guess I'm looking for a scaleable job. I just know that I would be infinitely happy with just 2 more hours each weekday. But that simple request feels like it's impossible.

Thanks guys for all input and advice
