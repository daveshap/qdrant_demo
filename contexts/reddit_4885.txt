Why I always feel alone?
I have my family but they always feel me that im a strong independent woman that i can solve everything in my own way. Im tired doing things. Im tired of being feeling strong. I always hide my feelings to everyone. I always kept feelings inside me now, it feels like my heart will bomb anytime.
