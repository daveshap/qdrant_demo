NED: I'm goin' on down to Kansas.
MUNNY: We got to kill this other one first. Shit, Ned, if we're lucky, we could kill him by nightfall... or maybe tomorrow morning. Then we could head back, all three of us, with the money.
NED: You want the Spencer, Bill?
MUNNY: Shit, Ned, this ain't the time to quit.
THE KID: You're gonna lose your share. If you don't...
MUNNY: Shut up, Kid.
