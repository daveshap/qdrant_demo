PORTER: You folks need any help?
STELLA: Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays.
PORTER: Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world- renowned agronomist?
STELLA: Yes.
PORTER: It's a privilege to meet you, sir, I'm familiar with all your work.
STELLA: Let's go, Daddy. We have to check in. He was never appreciated at the Institute.
PORTER: Ah, yes, the Institute, I'm familiar with it.
STELLA: Now he's D-Y-I-N-Ging and wants to be buried on Mercury.
