It's not even my problem but I've had enough of it.
My best friend is in an abusive marriage. They haven't even been married that long. She sends me pictures of the bruises he gives her. They argue over the dumbest things! I've told her multiple times to report his drunk ass to the police but she uses the "But I love him" card... I've even been harsh with the cold truth pulling the "If he really did love you like he said he wouldn't be treating you like that" card. Her last boyfriend did this to her too, but this was before I met her. I save all of the messages she sends me of him threatening her, and the pictures of her bruised face and body. What really bothers me is that they act like the "happy couple" when I am around or when other friends are around. Even on facebook and Instashit they have pictures where they seem stuck in a surreal love cave. I've had enough of it. I don't want to hear any of the bullshit anymore. I told her to do something or deal with it.... She is choosing to deal with it, and me being the friend, it makes me deal with it too. She's begged me not to go to the police or to her family. What else can I do? I can't even stand being in the same room as that asshole without imagining throwing a hot iron at him. 

Yesterday was the last straw... I was dropping off her birthday cupcake, red velvet (her favorite). I met up with her at her house, she was waiting in her car & when she got out to greet me, she was limping. I walked with her inside, her husband was on the couch and he starting being a smart ass to me, of course I don't put up with anyones BS so I shut him up. I go to her room and tell her to let me see it... she looks sad & ashamed, takes her pants off... 2 goddamn bruises the size of my galaxy 4 on her thigh and calf... really??

I don't know what to do. 

Edit: Now that I think about it... The title should read "I've had enough of it"... It is my problem.
