ALICE: I've been working double shifts.
DAN: Extra money, huh?
ALICE: Look, you know why, you just don't believe me.
DAN: No offense, or anything, but it's kind of hard to swallow.
ALICE: The story is, the deaths you can't argue with.
DAN: How long have you been awake?
ALICE: Three days.
DAN: Alright, let's assume this whole thing is true. Why does Freddy all of a sudden need you?
ALICE: Kristen was the last child left of the people who killed Freddy. Maybe Freddy can't get to new kids without someone like me. Someone to bring them to him.
