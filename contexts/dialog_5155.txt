KAYLEIGH: You know how spiritual he's gotten ever since he saved Mrs. Halpern and Katie.
EVAN: He saved Mrs. Halpern? Please, the twisted fuck.
KAYLEIGH: Is something the matter?
EVAN: Yeah, I think I gotta get these fixed or something.
EVAN: Kayleigh? Do you ever think about us?" I mean
KAYLEIGH: Sure, Evan, why not? You were the first person I really ever cared about.
EVAN: I was?
KAYLEIGH: That's why when I was little I never went to live with my mother.
EVAN: I don't get it.
KAYLEIGH: When my folks split, they gave me and Tommy a choice who we wanted to live with. I couldn't stand my dad, but I knew if I moved to my mom's I'd never see you again.
EVAN: I never knew that. So then you still sometimes think of us... together?
KAYLEIGH: It's crossed my mind from time to time.
EVAN: And...?
KAYLEIGH: Well a lot of things cross my mind. I've always been a fast thinker, Ev. I can play out the movie of our entire lives in under a second. Boom -- we fall in love -- get married -- two kids, your keen analytical insight matched to my generous nature -- kids grow old as do we, relatively stable relationships, matching burial plots, the whole bit. It took a lot longer to spit out than to imagine.
EVAN: Then you think it might have worked out?
KAYLEIGH: Why not? But that's not how things wound up. I'm with Lenny, Lenny's your friend. And there it ends.
