Amazon just emailed me notifying me that my rental textbook case has been "closed." I still have the textbook though.... Anyone else get this?
Link to screen shots of my email and Amazon account w/ the textbook in question:

The other two have indeed been shipped back to Amazon, despite having two different statuses (wtf)

I DID get an email a couple of weeks ago saying that my rental was extended, but not that I could keep it lol.

Also, real talk, I'm not someone who would steal from a company, but if this is a glitch in my favor, I would love to add this to my professional library....

Maybe I'll just email them right now.
