TENZIN GYATSO: I need to know what you know. I am no longer a child.
LORD CHAMBERLAIN: Ask whatever you will.
TENZIN GYATSO: What is the danger from the Chinese, now?
KASHAG MEMBER: Very complicated, Holiness. Let me tell you current news. The Chinese have launched a deceptive campaign aimed at convincing the world that Tibet belongs to China. We sent a mission to the Chinese National Conference. Our attendance was a grave mistake.
KASHAG MEMBER: The Tibetans were introduced as delegates from the Chinese region of Tibet". We protested this reference and demanded a letter rebutting it."
TENZIN GYATSO: Did you receive the letter?
KASHAG MEMBER: We did not.
LORD CHAMBERLAIN: The war is over. This is a time in when nations are redefining themselves.
TENZIN GYATSO: So, Tibet, too, needs to define itself.
LORD CHAMBERLAIN: Yes. As a free country. But our attempts have proven futile. We continue to be badly outmaneuvered by the Chinese.
TENZIN GYATSO: Can India help us?
LORD CHAMBERLAIN: India is a newly independent nation. They are struggling. India is in no position to help us.
TENZIN GYATSO: Britain?
LORD CHAMBERLAIN: Britain chooses not to.
TENZIN GYATSO: And, America?
LORD CHAMBERLAIN: America, we shall see.
TENZIN GYATSO: Ask the Chinese mission to leave our country. Immediately.
LORD CHAMBERLAIN: Quite simple. Yes. Good.
TENZIN GYATSO: I shall send a letter to America, to the President, informing him of our problem.
