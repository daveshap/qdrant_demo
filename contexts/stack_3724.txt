Confounds alternative- additional variable Let's say that we would like to predict y from x, and we are aware that there are many confounds we wouldn't be able to deal with.Would it be a reasonable idea to find another variable, z, which has less confounds with x, but may be predicted by x, and has less confounds with y, but may predict y.Does this sounds reasonable? If yes- is this a common strategy, in cases of unknown confounds, or confounds which may not be eliminated for some reason?Thanks!
