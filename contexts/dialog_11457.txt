BARON: Like dancing?
FLAEMMCHEN: Not with strangers.
BARON: Never?
FLAEMMCHEN: You're a fool!
BARON: Yes, I am rather.
BARON: He must be very nice.
FLAEMMCHEN: Who?
BARON: Whoever is keeping you waiting.
FLAEMMCHEN: Have you seen it?
BARON: Oh, my large and noisy neighbor -- really? That?
FLAEMMCHEN: That.
BARON: You?
FLAEMMCHEN: Oh -- work!!
BARON: Oh!
FLAEMMCHEN: Dictation. You know...
BARON: Oh... poor child. If you were free, I'd ask you to come and have some tea -- but --
FLAEMMCHEN: Tea would spoil my dinner. One meal a day, I'd hate to spoil it.
BARON: Reducing?
FLAEMMCHEN: No -- why? -- should I?
BARON: Lord no -- charming -- but why one meal a day?
FLAEMMCHEN: Money -- Ever heard of it?
BARON: Yes -- yes indeed -- but you are a... ...a stenographer. Don't little stenographers earn little pennies?
FLAEMMCHEN: Very little.
BARON: Too bad.
FLAEMMCHEN: Did you ever see a stenographer with a decent frock on? -- One that she'd bought herself?
BARON: Poor child -- I wish I were free tonight -- we could --
FLAEMMCHEN: Aren't you?
BARON: What?
FLAEMMCHEN: Free --
BARON: Unfortunately no -- to bad -- tomorrow though.
FLAEMMCHEN: Tomorrow? What time tomorrow?
BARON: Shall we say five o'clock -- downstairs?
FLAEMMCHEN: Where downstairs?
BARON: Yellow Room where they dance --
FLAEMMCHEN: You're very funny --
BARON: Yes? -- Tomorrow?
FLAEMMCHEN: Of course.
BARON: Really?
BARON: We'll dance.
FLAEMMCHEN: All right. We'll dance.
