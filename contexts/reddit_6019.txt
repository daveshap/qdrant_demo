Are museum jobs dead for the foreseeable future?
Been a museum/zoo educator my entire adult life.  With Covid-19, many of my friends in the same field across the country have been laid off.  We're in this business not for the money, but because we're passionate about what we do.  Still we have to pay the bills.  Is this the time to put that passion aside and find something new, or do you think museums/camps/zoos will bounce back in some way?
