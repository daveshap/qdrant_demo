SICK BOY: It's certainly a phenomenon in all walks of life.
RENTON: What do you mean?
SICK BOY: Well, at one time, you've got it, and then you lose it, and it's gone for ever. All walks of life: George Best, for example, had it and lost it, or David Bowie, or Lou Reed -
RENTON: Some of his solo stuff's not bad.
SICK BOY: No, it's not bad, but it's not great either, is it? And in your heart you kind of know that although it sounds all right, it's actually just shite.
RENTON: So who else?
SICK BOY: Charlie Nicholas, David Niven, Malcolm McLaren, Elvis Presley. -
RENTON: OK, OK, so what's the point you're trying to make?
SICK BOY: All I'm trying to do is help you understand that The Name of the Rose is merely a blip on an otherwise uninterrupted downward trajectory.
RENTON: What about The Untouchables?
SICK BOY: I don't rate that at all.
RENTON: Despite the Academy award?
SICK BOY: That means fuck all. The sympathy vote.
RENTON: Right. So we all get old and then we can't hack it any more. Is that it?
SICK BOY: Yeah.
RENTON: That's your theory?
SICK BOY: Yeah, Beautifully fucking illustrated.
RENTON: Give me the gun.
