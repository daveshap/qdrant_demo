VIVIAN: Hey Sugar, you lookin' for a date?
EDWARD: What's that?
VIVIAN: You looking' for some company?
EDWARD: Uh, no. How do I get to Beverly Hills?
VIVIAN: What? You gonna tell me you're lost?
EDWARD: Yes.
VIVIAN: Great. What do I look like a tourguide?
EDWARD: No, you look like a hooker.
VIVIAN: Actually, I'm a movie star out for a walk.
EDWARD: Good. Can you tell me how to get to Beverly Hills?
VIVIAN: Sure. For five bucks.
EDWARD: That's ridiculous.
VIVIAN: The price just went up to ten.
EDWARD: Why don't you just do it out of the kindness of your heart?
VIVIAN: Sit... and spin.
EDWARD: Sit-and-spin. Alright... why not?
