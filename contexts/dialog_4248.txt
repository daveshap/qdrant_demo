REBECCA: Yes.
REESE: What time did you leave?
REBECCA: Six thirty -- and he was very much alive.
CARDENAS: Miss Lawson, do you use cocaine?
REBECCA: I have.
CARDENAS: Did you use it the night Marsh died?
REBECCA: No. I haven't done it in years.
REESE: Did Marsh use it?
REBECCA: No -- never.
REESE: It had to get there somehow.
REBECCA: It didn't get there from me.
CARDENAS: Were you aware of Mr. Marsh's heart condition?
REBECCA: No.
CARDENAS: Mr. Marsh's Cardiologist and his nurse have told us that you accompanied Mr. Marsh to their office on at least two occasions.
REBECCA: That's correct -- but Andrew never told me he had a heart condition. He said he had a heart arrhythmia and it was nothing serious.
