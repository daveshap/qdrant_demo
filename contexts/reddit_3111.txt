What can I do with my psychology degree?
Hi all. 

I am a 23 year old about to graduate with my bachelors degree in psychology this December. I am posting here today because I am lost on what doors this degree opens for me. I went into college almost straight out of high school with no idea what I wanted to do. I went because that’s what I was expected to do. I told myself I’d figure out a career later. My entire time in college, I have also worked part-time jobs, ranging from food service to my current retail gig. Working and my full class schedule took up most of my time, and so I never explored my interests beyond the courses required for my degree. I did not volunteer or join clubs, I worked and got good grades. 

I have spent time looking for full time jobs I could get with my degree, and the ones that pay what I need to support myself all want experience of some sort. Currently, my parents are pressuring me to apply to law school and go from there. I’m not 100% sold on the idea of being a lawyer. I guess I’m just looking for advice on routes I can take with just a bachelors degree and customer service experience. 

Thank you to anyone who takes the time to read this
