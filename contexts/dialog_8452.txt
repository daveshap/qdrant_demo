PAULSEN: Oh. Oh.
ERIN: No one put me up to anything. I was just hoping I could ask you a couple questions.
PAULSEN: Of course! Oh, gosh, of course --
PAULSEN: Well, look, there isn't a ton of information here, but from what there is, I'd say that these two people here -- what are their names? Shanna and Ashley?
ERIN: Right, I guess those are the kids --
PAULSEN: They've both got some immune system problem. Can't say what from, whether it's viral or genetic or what, but something's wrong. And these guys -- Donna and Peter --
ERIN: Their parents, I'm pretty sure.
PAULSEN: Well, from what this stuff says, I'd say they both have some form of cancer.
