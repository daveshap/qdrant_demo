Jared Kushner reportedly wanted to establish a secret communications channel with the Kremlin. Is there precedent for such conduct, and is it legal?
From the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/russian-ambassador-told-moscow-that-kushner-wanted-secret-communications-channel-with-kremlin/2017/05/26/520a14b4-422d-11e7-9869-bac8b446820a_story.html?utm_term=.6bb9bfa9dc78):

>Jared Kushner and Russia’s ambassador to Washington discussed the possibility of setting up a secret and secure communications channel between Trump’s transition team and the Kremlin, using Russian diplomatic facilities in an apparent move to shield their pre-inauguration discussions from monitoring, according to U.S. officials briefed on intelligence reports.

>Ambassador Sergey Kislyak reported to his superiors in Moscow that Kushner, son-in-law and confidant to then-President-elect Trump, made the proposal during a meeting on Dec. 1 or 2 at Trump Tower, according to intercepts of Russian communications that were reviewed by U.S. officials. Kislyak said Kushner suggested using Russian diplomatic facilities in the United States for the communications.

According to [Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/05/27/jared-kushner-hr-mcmaster-not-concerned-238885), National Security Advisor General McMaster responded to questions about the report by with this:

>“We have backchannel communications with a number of countries. What that allows you to do is communicate in a discreet manner so I’m not concerned.”

According to the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/26/us/politics/kushner-talked-to-russian-envoy-about-creating-secret-channel-with-kremlin.html), the purpose of the channel was "to discuss strategy in Syria and other policy issues." According to the same NYT article, the channel was never set up.

My ultimate question is this: is this conduct a normal occurrence in the course of Presidential transition activities?
