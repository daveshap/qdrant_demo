First professional conference in grad school - tips to ease nerves?
I’m giving my first poster presentation in my graduate school career tomorrow. I’ve done poster and oral presentations before in my undergrad and am fine with talking in front of people, but I have some experts in my field looking forward to talking with me about my presentation and I’m super nervous all of a sudden. Any tips to ease the nerves so I don’t choke and screw up tomorrow?
