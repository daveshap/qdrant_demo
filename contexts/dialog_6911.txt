ALICE: I thought you were with Amy.
EDWARD: No, she went runnin' off to some old house she was talkin' about yesterday.
ALICE: That's the Farren house.
EDWARD: Is that where she got the ring, Mrs. Reed? She shouldn't be up there.
ALICE: But I told her to go with you.
EDWARD: She said something about that, Mrs. Reed â€” but she didn't tell me it was the Farren house. I'll get my other hat and coat and go over there.
ALICE: You do that, Edward.
MISS CALLAHAN: That the old actress -- Julia Farren?
ALICE: Yes, She's a little odd, I understand.
MISS CALLAHAN: But quite harmless, I'm sure.
