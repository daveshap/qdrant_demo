HanAholeSolo v CNN: Blackmail or Protection by CNN?
Recently, [Trump tweeted](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/881503147168071680) a meme that a redditor [claimed credit for](https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6ku6mp/wow_i_never_expected_my_meme_to_be_retweeted_by/).  

It was then found that same redditor had a [post history](http://www.npr.org/2017/07/03/535351893/reddit-user-taking-credit-for-trump-tweet-video-has-history-of-bigoted-posts) that "could be described at best as questionable, and at worst racist and xenophobic". 

CNN [says](http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/04/politics/kfile-reddit-user-trump-tweet/index.html)
> CNN is not publishing "HanA**holeSolo's" name because he is a private citizen who has issued an extensive statement of apology, showed his remorse by saying he has taken down all his offending posts, and because he said he is not going to repeat this ugly behavior on social media again. In addition, he said his statement could serve as an example to others not to do the same.

> CNN reserves the right to publish his identity should any of that change.

Many are claiming that [this is blackmail](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2017/07/05/the-reddit-user-behind-trumps-cnn-meme-apologized-but-cnnblackmail-is-the-story-taking-hold/)

So: Is it blackmail?  Is it CNN just doing that user a favor?  Is there another take that I'm not seeing?
