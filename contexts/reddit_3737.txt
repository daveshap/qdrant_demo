Guys who can't get dates, how do you cope with the loneliness?
21M Virgin here. My question is to others in my boat, how do you get over the feeling of missing out and being unattractive to women. It really sucks never having experienced cuddles, or holding a girls hand or kissing. It's always on my mind when I see other couples, and the medias constant barrage of romance and sex.

What's the best way to cope with the feeling of loneliness?
