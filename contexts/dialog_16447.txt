SWANN: You think I'm an asshole.
HARRY: Didn't know you read minds.
SWANN: I can do a lot of shit, D'Amour. But you know that. So I like playing games with people. Gives them something to wonder about...
HARRY: Is that all?
SWANN: I distract them from their banality for a few minutes. It's like a public service. It doesn't mean much in the end. They're all going to die.
HARRY: And you're not?
SWANN: Oh, I was going to discover the secret of the universe. That's why I liked Nix. He promised me all these explanations.
HARRY: And he didn't have them?
SWANN: He had something. He showed me how to bend the rules. A little levitation. A few fireworks.
HARRY: Is that all?
SWANN: No. At the end... when we had him cornered, he got into my head. He showed me what we really look like, when the veneer's gone. Jelly. Shit...
HARRY: And you believed him?
SWANN: I saw it with my own fucking eyes! See, that's his best trick. No illusions. Just the truth. Are you ready for that?
