ALEX: You needn't take it any further, sir. You've proved to me that all this ultra-violence and killing is wrong and terribly wrong. I've learned my lesson, sir. I see now what I've never seen before I'm cured, praise Bog!
DR. BRODSKY: You're not cured yet, my boy.
DR. BRODSKY: You must take your chance boy. The choice has been all yours.
ALEX: But, Sir... Missus... I see that it's wrong! It's wrong because it's like against like society. It's wrong because everybody has the right to live and be happy without being tolchocked and knifed.
DR. BRODSKY: No, no, boy. You really must leave it to us, but be cheerful about it. In less than a fortnight now, you'll be a free man.
