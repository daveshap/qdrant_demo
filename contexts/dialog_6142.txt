RANDAL: Get to work.
DANTE: What'd you rent? Best of Both Worlds?
RANDAL: Hermaphroditic porn. Starlets with both organs. You should see the box: Beautiful women with dicks that put mine to shame.
DANTE: And this is what you rented?
RANDAL: I like to expand my horizons.
DANTE: I got fined for selling cigarettes to a minor.
RANDAL: No way!
DANTE: Five hundred dollars.
RANDAL: You're bullshitting.
RANDAL: I didn't think they even enforced this.
DANTE: Living proof.
RANDAL: I thought you never sold cigarettes to kids.
DANTE: I don't; you did.
RANDAL: Really?
DANTE: Little girl. Maybe five years old?
RANDAL: Holy shit. That girl?
DANTE: As opposed to the hundreds of other children you let buy cigarettes whenever you work here.
RANDAL: Then how come you got the fine?
DANTE: Because I'm here.
RANDAL: You're lying.
DANTE: I swear. I couldn't make this kind of hell up.
RANDAL: Then why aren't you like screaming at me right now?
DANTE: Because I'm happy.
RANDAL: You're happy?
DANTE: I'm happy.
RANDAL: You're happy to get a fine?
DANTE: No. I'm happy because Caitlin came to see me.
RANDAL: Now I know you're lying.
DANTE: I'm not. She just left.
RANDAL: What did she say?
DANTE: She's not going to marry that guy. She went home to tell her mother.
RANDAL: You're kidding.
DANTE: I'm not.
RANDAL: Wow. You've had quite an evening.
DANTE: She went home, she's getting ready, and we're going out.
RANDAL: I feel so ineffectual. Is there anything I can do for you?
DANTE: Watch the store while I go home and change.
RANDAL: What happened to title dictates behavior?
DANTE: This is my way of spitting water at life.
RANDAL: Hey, what about Veronica?
DANTE: No! Don't bring it up. I don't want to think about that now. Let me enjoy this hour of bliss. I'll think about all of that later. In the meantime, nobody mentions the V word.
RANDAL: You're a snake.
DANTE: In my absence, try not to sell cigarettes to any newborns.
RANDAL: You want me to bring the VCR over here so we can watch this?
DANTE: I might be leaving early to go out with Caitlin, in which case you'll have to close the store tonight.
RANDAL: All right, but you're missing out. Chicks with dicks.
DANTE: I'll read the book.
CUSTOMER: Cute cat. What's his name.
RANDAL: Peptic ulcer.
CAITLIN: Randal Graves-scourge of the video renter.
RANDAL: Ladies and gentleman, Mrs. Asian Design Major herself: Caitlin Bree!
CAITLIN: You saw that article? God, isn't it awful? My mother sent that in.
RANDAL: I take it she likes the guy.
CAITLIN: You'd think she was marrying him. What are you watching?
RANDAL: Children's programming. What did your mom say when you told her you weren't engaged anymore?
CAITLIN: She said not to come home until graduation.
RANDAL: Wow, you got thrown out? For Dante?
CAITLIN: What can I say? He does weird things to me.
RANDAL: Can I watch?
CAITLIN: You can hold me down.
RANDAL: Can I join in?
CAITLIN: You might be let down. I'm not a hermaphrodite.
RANDAL: Few are. So what makes you think you can maintain a relationship with Dante this time around?
CAITLIN: A woman's intuition. Something in me says it's time to give the old boy a serious try.
RANDAL: Wow. Hey, I was just about to order some dinner. You eat Chinese, right?
CAITLIN: Dick.
RANDAL: Exactly.
CAITLIN: So where is he?
RANDAL: He went home to change for the big date.
CAITLIN: God, isn't he great?
RANDAL: No, this is great.
CAITLIN: Can I use the bathroom?
RANDAL: There's no light back there.
CAITLIN: Why aren't there any lights?
RANDAL: Well, there are, but for some reason they stop working at five-fourteen every night.
CAITLIN: You're kidding.
RANDAL: Nobody can figure it out. And the boss doesn't want to pay the electrician to fix it, because the electrician owes money to the video store.
CAITLIN: Such a sordid state of affair.
RANDAL: And I'm caught in the middle-torn between my loyalty for the boss, and my desire to piss with the light on.
CAITLIN: I'll try to manage.
RANDAL: Hey Caitlin... Break his heart again this time, and I'll kill you. Nothing personal.
CAITLIN: You're very protective of him, Randal. You always have been.
RANDAL: Territoriality. He was mine first.
CAITLIN: Awww. That was so cute.
