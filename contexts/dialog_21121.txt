RHAH: Not the only man to meet his Jezebel either.
KING: So he got a reduced and come over here. Nam's his freedom man, Nam's his pussy. Three years he been here.
CHRIS: Three years, Jesus, he's crazy as Barnes...
KING: Well sometimes a man jes don' wanna go back. How you gonna talk to civilians man? People back in the world just don't give a shit, y'know what I mean, to them you're a fuckin' animal is all -
LERNER: I was home on leave y'know and everybody's just worried 'bout making money, everybody's out for themselves, they don't even want to talk about it man, it's like the fucking Twilight Zone back there - you wouldn't even KNOW there's a war on here. My sister says to me why you have to go there like I started this...
RHAH: Baaaa! Fuck it, they sold us out - so what! What'd you'all expect? Civilian life is phoney BULLSHIT man. They're ROBOTS man - watchin' dopey television and drivin' dopey cars, and they fuck up, nobody dies. That's all right, you keep fuckin' up, politicians keep lyin'. Cause it don't really matter. Don't mean shit. So what! Whatcha want - a parade! Fuck that too! No war time no grunt never got no respect. Till he was dead - and even THEN! You're fighting for YOURSELF man! You're fighting for your SOUL, dat's all. Remember dat. And it's some goddamn battle too - if you'se a man, wrestle with that angel... ...Love and Hate - the whole shitbang show, that's the story then and now and it ain't hardly gonna change...
CHRIS: ...I can't sleep, why don't you get some sack time.
ELIAS: ...don't feel like it either.
CHRIS: ...beautiful night.
ELIAS: Yeah. I love this place at night. The stars... there's no right or wrong in them, they're just there.
CHRIS: That's a nice way of putting it.
CHRIS: Barnes got it in for you, don't he?
ELIAS: Barnes believes in what he's doing.
CHRIS: And you, do you believe?
ELIAS: In '65 - yeah. Now... No. What happened today's just the beginning. We're gonna lose this war...
CHRIS: You really think so... us?
