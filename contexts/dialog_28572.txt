ALEXANDER: This is where my journey started... right here.
MARA: You lost someone.
ALEXANDER: Yes.
MARA: Someone you loved very much.
ALEXANDER: Yes... After her death, it was intolerable for me here... The future had to be better.
MARA: Is it?
ALEXANDER: If you only knew...
ALEXANDER: You've welcomed me into your home. Into your lives. Everyone has... For the first time in a long time it doesn't hurt quite so much. I thank you for that.
MARA: I know what it is to lose someone. When my husband was taken from us... I thought the pain would never end.
