DODGE: What, you think there's something funny about it?
MURPHY: A ship with fifty million dollars in gold aboard, adrift? And nobody seems to care enough to come looking for it?
GREER: If they thought it was lost at sea, they probably just wrote it off.
MURPHY: Not for fifty million. An ocean liner maybe. But fifty million in gold, they come looking for.
EPPS: Maybe they didn't want it back. Maybe the whole fat deal was insured.
MURPHY: Maybe. But there's always somebody whose interest's at stake.
