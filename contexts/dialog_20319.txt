JOHNNY: I ain't interested in his mental condition. All I want to know is, is he D 'n D or is he a canary?
CHARLEY: I wish I knew.
JOHNNY: So do I, Charley. For your sake.
CHARLEY: What do you want me to do, Johnny?
JOHNNY: Very simple. Just bring him to... that place we been using. Mac, you take care of the details. Call Gerry G. in if you think you need him.
CHARLEY: Gerry G!! You don't want to do that, Johnny! Sure the boy's outa line, but he's just a confused kid.
JOHNNY: Confused kid? First he crosses me in public and gets away with it and then the next joker, and pretty soon I'm just another fellow down here.
CHARLEY: Johnny, I can't do that. I can't do that, Johnny.
JOHNNY: Then don't.
CHARLEY: But my own kid broâ€”
JOHNNY: This is for you to figure out. You can have it your way or you can have it his way. But you can't have it both ways. Am I right, Sonny?
