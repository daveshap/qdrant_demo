SIDNEY: So...
BILLY: So... I'm sorry. I've been a selfish shit and I'm sorry.
SIDNEY: No, Billy. I'm the one who's been selfish and self-absorbed with all of my post traumatic stress.
BILLY: You lost your mom...
SIDNEY: But you're right -- enough is enough. I can't wallow in the grief process forever and I can't keep lying to myself about who my mom was.
SIDNEY: I think in some weird analytical, psychological bullshit way I'm scared I'm gonna turn out just like her, you know? Like the bad seed or something...
BILLY: Oh Sidney...
SIDNEY: Everytime I get close to you I see my mom. I know it doesn't make sense.
BILLY: Sure it does. It's like Jodie Foster in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS when she kept having flashbacks of her dead father.
SIDNEY: But this is life. This isn't a movie.
BILLY: Sure it is, Sid. It's all a movie. Life's one great big movie. Only you can't pick your genre.
SIDNEY: I wanna let go. I do...
BILLY: Ssshh... everything's gonna be okay. I promise.
