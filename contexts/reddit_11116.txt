IM GETTING ADOPTED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
So me and my stepdad were having a man to man talk and he asked me if I would mind if he adopted me. I grew up without a dad in my life and everyone that was there before him was nothing but a bag of dicks. But when he asked me I just felt the weight of so much stuff just leave my shoulders. I'm just so so so Goddamn happy right now. I'm not trying to be a karma whore or anything thing like that. I just hope everyone has an amazing life and don't let anything/anyone bring you down.

Edit 1-just some spelling issues that i noticed

Edit 2-i can safely say I didn't expect the gold thank you for your generosity
