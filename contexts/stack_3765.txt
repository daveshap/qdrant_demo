How to interpret pairs plot in R? I am a beginner in plotting/graphing. Kindly explain how  to interpret the pairwise scatter plots generated using pairs() function in R. The data contains 323 columns of different indicators of a disease. Although I see that many columns are mean, std, slope, min, max and so on of any one parameter. For example, for an attribute like 'walking', there are other attributes like: sum.slope.walking, meansquares.slope.walking, sd.slope.walking and so on. Is it okay to select any one parameter in such a case (such as meansquares.slope..) ? What are the patterns to look out for to identify relationships between attributes ?
