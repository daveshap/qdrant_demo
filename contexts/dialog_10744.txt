SEYMOUR: Hey, it's nearly nine already - we're gonna have to leave now if we're going to make that movie.
DANA: Oh, all right... Party-pooper! Just let me put a few things away.
DANA: I'm so excited to see this film - Dustoffvarnya is such a brilliant director! Did you see his last film, The Flower That Drank The Moon? It was simply glorious!
SEYMOUR: Uh, no. I missed that one. But what do I know? I like Laurel and Hardy movies.
DANA: Really? I never really cared for those. Why does the fat one always have to be so mean to the skinny one?
SEYMOUR: Uh... hello?
ENID: Hi, it's me...
SEYMOUR: Oh, hi...
ENID: So, what happened?
SEYMOUR: Actually, it's kind of still happening... she's over here right now... I think everything's going pretty well...
ENID: What? You're kidding me...
SEYMOUR: Yeah, so I better go -- it's not really the best time to talk...
ENID: What, are you going to like have sex with her on your first date?
SEYMOUR: Jesus, Enid... I'll talk to you later... bye!
REBECCA: Hello?
ENID: Do you still want to do something tonight?
REBECCA: What happened to Seymour?
ENID: I can't believe it - he actually scored!
REBECCA: How repulsive!
ENID: So should I come over?
REBECCA: Actually, I'm just about to go out with some friends...
ENID: What are you talking about? Who?
REBECCA: Just some people from work...
ENID: I don't believe you.
REBECCA: Yeah well, you said you were busy... look, I'd better get going... I'll call you tomorrow.
JOSH: Hi... what's up?
ENID: Can I come in?
JOSH: Are you the one who left that note?
ENID: I guess.
