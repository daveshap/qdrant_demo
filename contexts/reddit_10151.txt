“If you truly wanted to kill yourself and wasn’t seeking attention, you’d just do it and tell no one so no one could stop you”
Yeah because I DONT WANT TO FUCKING DO IT, but I’m out of options and want the feeling to stop! It’s 20 fucking 20, why is opening up about suicide still “selfish” and “grow up” and “stop attention seeking” IM ASKING FOR FUCKING HELP YOU BLIND FUCKS. 

Oh and when someone else opens up about it, it’s all love and support and strength but when DICKHEAD FAILURE me does, I’m a weirdo and “negative” and “selfish” and “playing games”. 

I will not kill myself. I will just sit here, suffer, and hate the fucking world until the day I die.
