When someone shows you who they are the first time, believe them
There will  come a time when you've  learned that people are who they are. Never change, but become better versions of themselves. For better or for worst.

We  whether  men or women make the error  of acting like we know someone better than they know themselves. This leads to us expecting that by tomorrow, she'll treat me better or maybe he just  had a bad day and its going to get better tomorrow.  Only issue  is the fact that its been 2 years and one day turns into 24 months.

We're  all guilty  of this and we all fall into the trap of falling for the idea of someone rather than the actuality. It is this idea of fantasy that leaves us broken with time wasted and regret. 

Everyone in life has to learn and teach all in the split second. Some for better or for worse.  When they leave and they did you wrong dont fall for it. They'll  do it again. When you're  in a dead end relationship  don't  act like one good meal or a night of sex will make it better.
When you're  on a date and you feel that he or she want you gone dont chase them.

This is one step into realizing self worth and moving onto better people in your path.
