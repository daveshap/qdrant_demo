culture shock while studying abroad
hey so i just made reddit just to ask this, has anyone experienced anything similar? (tldr just in case)

i changed schools from my home country (hong kong) to the UK a year ago. just some background, studying abroad that far away from home isn’t uncommon here, so it wasn’t that strange when i decided to leave. i felt very confined in my old school, disconnected from classmates cuz the humour i developed from spending hours on end on the internet was very different from my peers, so i had a handful of friends and that was about it. when i left, i thought i would be exposing myself to a myriad of new people, some that might share a similar sense of humour, long story short that didn’t really happen, in fact, since i go to school in the middle of nowhere now, it’s probably worse since people barely use or are exposed to the internet in the same way people living smack dab in the heart of a city do.

tldr, i felt culturally isolated in my home country in terms of humour and conversation topics, moved countries to improve the situation, felt culturally isolated in a new country. i have a feeling it’s something to do w/ social anxiety as well, but has anyone else experienced similar problems when moving/studying abroad?

ps. i’m sorry if i make any mistakes w/ formatting or unwritten rules- i’m pretty new to using reddit (´；ω；`)
