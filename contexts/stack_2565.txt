Line/Polygon intersection with a tolerance in QGIS I have a layer with Polygon and a layer with Polylines.I am looking for the list of Polygons crossed by the Polylines.Just here it's relatively simple: intersection function.That said, the layout of the line is not perfect, so I would like to exclude polygon for which the line only touches the polygon contour or does not fit more than 1m into the polygon.
