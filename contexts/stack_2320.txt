Can you use the /testfor command to test for a player who is not at some coordinates At the moment, I have been dedicating time into learning command blocks. I am stumped on something at the moment.I am trying to make it so when you shift on coal blocks in certain co-ordinates it'll take 3 seconds then set to air and give you the coal blocks. But, I am wanting it so there's a duration of cool-down between this.I am trying to testfor players outside of the area and give them a tag to remove them from this. So, I'd have people outside with the tag \"outside' while people in that areas tag gets removedThe main problem being, how do I test for players outside of said co-ordinates.Edit: I know there is an alternative way to do this, I just want to try something new.
