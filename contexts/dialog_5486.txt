THEO: It could be a fire. This is Malibu.
LENORE: No, there's a police car way back there. See it, in the distance coming around the turn? The van is blocking it now.
THEO: What's Nels' number?
LENORE: 259-7881.
THEO: Dial him up. We need him to run interference.
LENORE: Nels, don't let that cop pass you.
NELSON: What am I supposed to do?
THEO: If he pulls me over he gets all the proceeds plus Lenore here.
NELSON: And if you ditch us we get zilch.
THEO: Sure, I end up with some cash. And a lot of bonds I don't know how to dispose of.
THEO: You're going to have to see to it that both lanes of this road get blocked.
NELSON: The fuck I will!
THEO: It's in your interest, Nels, since the additional passenger in my trunk -- an LAPD officer is probably carrying a few bullets in him traceable to the piece you're carrying. Tell the man.
LENORE: Lose the hardware now.
NELSON: We'll toss it when we make the blind curve.
THEO: You researched me. You know where I live. She'll be waiting for you there along with your split.
NELSON: There's two police cars now.
THEO: Tailgate me. I'll jam on the brakes. You go into a spin to avoid an accident and cut them off.
NELSON: You want us to get ourselves killed?
THEO: From what I can see you're a pretty fair wheelman. There's a hairpin coming up -- that's the place for it. The cops'll plow right into you.
NELSON: And I end up in a fucking neck brace for life!
THEO: Then you can sue the cops. Collect from both ends. Tighten your belts. Here it comes. Ready?
