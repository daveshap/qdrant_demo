Hypothesis Test of Hypothesis Tests I am doing a linguistics project in which I am comparing the % of the time \"um\" follows a contraction vs. the % of time \"um\" follows what I call the full form (e.g. full form of don't is do not). I have 100 contractions I'm looking at. For each contraction, I treat \"is followed by um or not\" as a binomial random variable and run a z-test accordingly. I would like to then run a test on all these tests to test if contractions do have an effect on \"um.\" The reason I can't just sum them all up and do one test is some contractions are way more frequent and therefore would dominate the data set. One issue is that it's possible the different contractions are not all distributed the same, such that the effect may only occur in some of them.In general it seems like you should be able to interpret multiple hypothesis tests to see the significance of your testing. For instance, if I'm using an alpha of 0.05 and I only get a p-value &lt; 0.05 in 5/100 of my tests, I could safely conclude those were just false positives and there isn't a general effect. Is there a more rigorous way to perform this test of tests?
