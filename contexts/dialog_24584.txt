SUGAR: I thought I heard voices - and I just had to talk to somebody. I don't feel like going to sleep.
JERRY: I know what you need - a slug of bourbon.
SUGAR: Oh, no. I'm off that stuff - for good.
JOE: Did you have a nice time?
SUGAR: Nice? It was suicidally beautiful.
JERRY: Did he get fresh?
SUGAR: Of course not. As a matter of fact, it was just the other way around. You see he needs help.
JERRY: What for?
SUGAR: And talk about elegant - you should see the yacht - candlelight - mint sauce and cranberries.
JOE: Gee, I wish I'd been there.
SUGAR: I'm going to see him again tonight - and every night - I think he's going to propose to me - as soon as he gets up his nerve.
JERRY: That's some nerve!
JOE: Daphne got a proposal tonight.
SUGAR: Really?
SUGAR: From a rich millionaire.
SUGAR: That's wonderful. Poor Josephine.
JOE: Me?
SUGAR: Daphne has a beau - I have a beau - if we could only find somebody for you.
