MARTHA: Mother Miriam was with you wasn't she?
AGNES: Yes.
MARTHA: She took the baby in her arms?
AGNES: Yes.
MARTHA: You saw it all didn't you?
AGNES: Yes.
MARTHA: And then... what did she do? Agnes what did she do?
AGNES: She... left me alone with that little thing, and I looked at it, and I thought this is a mistake. But it's my mistake, not Mommy's. God's mistake.
MARTHA: What did you do?
AGNES: I put her to sleep.
MARTHA: H... how?
AGNES: I tied the cord around her neck... wrapped her in the bloody sheets... and stuffed her in the trash can.
