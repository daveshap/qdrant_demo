DAD: You came through, Nicky.
NICKY: I came through for you, Mom and the butterflies, Dad.
DAD: You're back in Hell now, kid. There's no butterflies here. If you want butterflies, you need to be on Earth.
NICKY: What about you and Grandpa and everyone in Hell?
DAD: Nicky, I let my butterflies die once upon a time and it's never stopped hurting. That's right, you heard me, Holly. I'm still in love with you.
