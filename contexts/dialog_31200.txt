JIM: I know! I know!
ARTEMUS: I don't have to tell you what that would do to our careers!
JIM: We've got to stop him right here, now! With that armored steam engine of his it'll be a slaughter.
ARTEMUS: I'd love to stop him, but have you noticed the hundred armed men?
JIM: There's only seventy-eight.
ARTEMUS: Oh, well, then let's kick some ass!
ARTEMUS: You didn't tell us you had this on!
PEMBERTON: My Lord, he was telling the truth!
