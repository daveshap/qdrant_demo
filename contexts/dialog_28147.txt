DEBORAH: Whatever the reason, I’m sorry I did. Goodbye, Mr Lombard. I believe you know your way out.
LOMBARD: You knew he had nothing to do with your brother’s disappearance, didn’t you?
DEBORAH: Huh! Don’t you recall convincing me he had? You should learn to live with your mistakes, Mr Lombard. There is some merit in it.
LOMBARD: I take it you learnt to live with yours then. Take it all the mind-dulling pills in your medicine cabinet are surplus to your well-being...
DEBORAH: How... When did you...
LOMBARD: It must be tough being married to Adonis to end up sleeping alone every night. Sleep must be hard coming. What’s harder? The thought of the fine litter you two could have bred if? Or imagining what he does with his children?
