Is There A Website Like This? Where Interests Are Linked To Careers?
Is there a website that I can just type in a handful of interests/topics I like or excel at that will give me a list of careers that combine those interests/topics?

Example, if I were to type in **Geography** and **Computers**...it would give me a result like **GIS** for instance.

Cause I have a few interests I excel at and I'm certain there are careers that combine these skills, but I just don't know about them? Or haven't thought of them?

BTW, my interests are Geography, Economics & Geopolitics...I'm fairly good at Statistics too (have an undergrad degree in it). Are there careers that combine these skills? or at least 3  of them?

I'm also willing to pick up new skills if it means I can find a career which incorporates 3 of those 4 interests. Like Programming, Business Studies etc.
