DODGE: So. I got a question. Just from a, you know, purely technical standpoint. We call the Coastguard. Coastguard shows up. What exactly is the plan?
MURPHY: How do you mean?
DODGE: Well, they're gonna be asking a lot of questions. About us. About those bodies. About the gold. Seems like we oughta be prepared is all.
MURPHY: I guess the best strategy's just to tell them the truth.
DODGE: Yeah, well. The truth is one thing. When there's more than a few hundred million dollars involved, that's a whole new deal.
MURPHY: What do you propose?
DODGE: For starters, getting that gold off the ship. What they don't know about isn't gonna bother them.
MURPHY: There's no way we're gonna hide a few thousand pounds of gold from the Coastguard here. Besides, it'll be safer where it is.
DODGE: With all due respect, skipper. Part of that up there's mine. I'd kinda like to have a little say in what happens to it.
