PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT: Stop making tinder dates with people who are looking for a relationship if you “aren’t in a good place and not ready to date”.
This is happened to me 3 or 4 times in the last couple months and I’m starting to get sick of it. If I tell you I’m looking for a relationship, don’t try to make plans and then cancel last minute because you “don’t want to date right now.”

EDIT: since this keeps coming up and I can’t change the title, I’m not specifically only talking about tinder dates. I mean online dating in general. In my area, tinder just so happens to be the most common way to meet new people online. But I also use bumble and a couple other platforms.
