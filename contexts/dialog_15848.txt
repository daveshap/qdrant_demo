ELLE: Why didn't you call me?
DORKY DAVID: What?
ELLE: We spend a beautiful night together and then I never hear from you again?
DORKY DAVID: -- uh --
DORKY DAVID: I'm sorry?
ELLE: For what? Breaking my heart or ruining sex for me with any other man?
DORKY DAVID: Uh -- both?
ELLE: Forget it. I've already spent too many hours crying over you.
