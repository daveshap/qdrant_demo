PEGGY: Not now, Charlie. I've got a headache. Get used to the word. Roll it around your tongue for a years.
CHARLIE: Hey, I can take a hint. You look great today.
PEGGY: You drive like a maniac!
CHARLIE: I call this the staccato.
CHARLIE: Not that I'm glad you were sick, but I had a chance to do some thinking last night.
PEGGY: Oh yeah?
CHARLIE: You know. About what we said on Tuesday. It makes a lot of sense.
PEGGY: Refresh my memory.
CHARLIE: How could you forget? We talk about seeing other people and you forget?
PEGGY: Maybe I blocked it out.
CHARLIE: I can understand that.. But please don't start crying again.
CHARLIE: It's not going to be forever. I figure three years is long enough. I can see it the music pans out. And right after graduation we should start seeing other people. Kind of comparison shop before we settle down and get married. Know what I mean?
PEGGY: Why wait?
CHARLIE: Well, we got the prom coming up, all these parties. We shouldn't upset our parents?
PEGGY: They'll learn to live with it.
