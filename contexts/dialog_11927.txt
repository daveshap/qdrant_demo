LOOMIS: Yes?
TOMMY: Dr. Loomis, thank God you're here. You heard her, didn't you? It was Jamie.
LOOMIS: I'm sorry, but do I know you --
TOMMY: I'm Tommy. Tommy Doyle. Laurie Strode -- Jamie's mother -- she was baby-sitting for me that night --
LOOMIS: Yes ... Tommy. What are you doing here?
TOMMY: Please -- just tell me the truth. Has Michael Myers come home?
LOOMIS: What do you know about Michael?
TOMMY: I know he's alive. People in this town -- they want us to believe he's dead. But I know. I've always known.
LOOMIS: Right now at least one girl is dead and Jamie Lloyd is in there fighting for her life. She is the last of his blood line. If she dies --
TOMMY: No, Dr. Loomis. She's not the last night.
