Will my depression ever just go away? I am just so tired of emotional pain.
I am tired of thinking about death everyday and wanting to die. I am tired if thoughts like "Is death peaceful?". I am tired of wanting to self harm every single time I feel a negative emotion. I am honestly scared that one day I will end up killing myself. I know how I will do it, I just don't know when or if I will do it.
