Is there a stopwatch app available that shows the time on the sidebar? I am loving Ubuntu 16.04 and was wondering if there was an app that has a stopwatch in it. But I want it to show the timer on the side bar as time goes by.For example, I am studying and want to stop after 30 minutes. GNOME clocks does the job but I have to keep checking every now and then. I was wondering if there was a way to display how much time has passed on the little bar on the left.Thanks for reading
