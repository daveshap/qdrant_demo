\"To the best of one's ability\" - Synonym? I'm trying to rephrase <blockquote>  We help children move and play to the best of their ability.</blockquote>It's about children with movement concerns,so this seems semantically correct to me.I just need a different phrase.Can you suggest anything other than \"as well as they can\"? I've reviewed the suggested duplicate, but it doesn't answer my question.
