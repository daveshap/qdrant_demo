How much of stipend to spend on housing?
I am actually coming over from the world of r/medschool (lol don't kick me out). I am in a bit of an unusual situation for medical school and was hoping y'all could give me some advice.

I am super fortunate to have gotten accepted to a med school that is a) tuition free and b) offering a pretty generous stipend for living expenses. For those of you that may not be familiar, this is extremely rare in the med school world and I am a bit over my head with the idea of actually having to figure out a budget rather than just going 150K in debt.

I guess I am just wondering if there are any commonly used guidelines for figuring out how to budget in grad school. I know the "adult rule" is \~30% of income on housing, \~20% savings, \~50% needs and wants, but I'm not sure if that really applies here since I was not planning on saving a single cent during medical school on account of the whole loan thing. I want to be financially responsible, of course, but I'd also reallllyyyyy love to live alone, which would of course be $$$.

Anyways, any insight/advice is super welcome!

EDIT: Will be outside of LA, where COL is obviously not cheap
