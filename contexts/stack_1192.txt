Running remote stored procedure with DDL locally Sorry if my question is redundant, I searched Stack Exchange and the internet for hours but do not have a definitive answer to my question.Database: SQL Server 2017 + AzureThe goal is to build a BI infrastructureI have multiple (20+) database servers (clients) which all have one common database in the cloud (Azure). All these clients should be exactly the same when these are on the same DB version. To make life easier when doing an update (almost weekly, tuning), I want my 20+ databases to update automatically.I thought of the following solution:I create a table in the Azure DB which has the most recent client DB version (e.g. v1.2) checkIf I have an update script, I will put this as a stored procedure on the Azure DB. checkI schedule a task on the client which checks the most recent client DB version once a day and compares whether an update is needed. checkIf yes -> run the \"update\": this is the stored procedure on the Azure DB which have to run on the client DB. oh noHere I get into trouble, running the stored procedure which resides on the Azure DB obviously runs the stored procedure on the Azure DB. I don't know how I can run the stored procedure of the Azure DB on the client DB.Motivation: I thought it would be clever to do it this way so I only have to change the content of the stored procedure and all clients would update itself when getting a connection with the Azure DB. Also, is this the correct way of tackling this problem? Any help is much appreciated!If you need more information, please let me know.
