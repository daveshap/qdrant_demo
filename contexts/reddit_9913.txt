Student Affairs Professionals, what was your major as an undergraduate?
I'm currently in my sophomore year of undergrad as a Math major, and currently contemplating upgrading my Communications minor into a double major.

From what I've been told, student affairs graduate programs tend to be filled with people of several different undergrad backgrounds, so I wanted to see what the sampling of that looked like in this subreddit.
