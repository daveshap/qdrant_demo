How does scikit-learn's kNN model handle zero-distances when using inverse distance weighting? OK, I could go through the code to figure this out but I feel something Googleable doesn't hurt. When I'm using a kNN classifier with (inverse) distance weighting, how does it handle cases whereby the distance between the prediction input and (m)any of the k nearest training records is zero? What if some of them aren't?
