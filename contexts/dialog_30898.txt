CARTER: Its cramped in here isn't it BRIAN
MANAGER: Yes it is...
CARTER: Tell me BRIAN, what would happen if the client lost the key?
MANAGER: Then we would have to call in our locksmith to break the lock
CARTER: So there is only one key...
MANAGER: That's right...
CARTER: And it can't be forged?
MANAGER: I didn't say that - I'm sure it could be, but our clients must sign in first, checking signatures, and a photo ident - we had a nasty theft two years ago and we've been very strict since then.
