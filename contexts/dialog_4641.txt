ABBOTT: Call a Mayday into Berlin station. We need snipers, DOD, whatever they got. Snipers?
PAMELA: Hold on -- he said he wants to come in.
ABBOTT: My ass he does. You're playing with fire, Pamela. Marshall said nail him to the wall. I don't know how you interpreted that, but I don't think he meant repatriate him.
PAMELA: Don't you want answers?
ABBOTT: There are no answers. There's either Jason Bourne alive or Jason Bourne dead. And I for one would prefer the latter. And what about her? You just send her out to this lunatic with no protection?
PAMELA: What do you think? Is he coming in?
NICKY: I don't know. He was sick. He wanted out. I believed him.
PAMELA: Alright...
