Don't write about heroin in your essays guys!
After seeing the drug dealer post I thought it would be fun to update you on my college results! [I posted a while ago asking if it was a good idea to write my Common App essay on my former heroin addiction.](https://old.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/a04lbp/heroin_addiction_in_essays/)

I was deferred from my REA and accepted to my state school. I visited my state school and fell in love with it and realized I didn't care if I got rejected from all the top schools. So, for my RD schools, I decided to do it, against everyone's advice. I wrote the essay, it was beautiful. Showed it to my counselor and she cried (and then she told me to not submit it).

Anyways, I got rejected from all my RD schools, lol. My counselor apparently talks to the AOs though (?!?) and they said they liked/loved my essay, but couldn't convince the rest of the AOs to vote for a former heroin addict. My counselor said that the AOs said they really can't vibe with essays that involve drugs, alcohol, sex/rape, or violence. 

BUT, I got into my REA school after being deferred!!!!! So I guess everything works out in the end?

EDIT: To clarify (I've rephrased the post, too), I wrote a "tame" but good essay for my EA and REA schools, and then applied with my heroin essay to RD schools. I'm paraphrasing what my counselor said, by the way, the gist is that essentially AOs personally liked my essay but institutionally, it made me inadmissible.
