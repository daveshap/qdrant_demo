AMY: What happened to you?
WELLES: I'm okay, honey, I'm okay. Are you alright?
AMY: What's going on, Tom? What happened?
WELLES: I can't tell you, Amy. You know I can't. You have to trust me...
AMY: Tom...
WELLES: It has to be this way for now. It won't be long.
AMY: Why haven't you called? Why don't you answer your phone?
WELLES: I don't know. I'm sorry...
AMY: You're sorry? What was I supposed to think?
AMY: You owe me an explanation. You can't treat me like this.
WELLES: I wanted to call. I couldn't.
AMY: You couldn't?
WELLES: You don't understand...
AMY: No, I don't, because you're not telling me anything!
WELLES: I was in hell. If I called you... if I heard your voice... it would have been so easy for me to quit. I couldn't do that.
AMY: You should have.
WELLES: Amy, I'm not going to let anything happen to us.
AMY: Look where we are. Look at yourself. You son of a bitch, you don't have any idea what you're putting me through...
WELLES: I don't know what to say
AMY: You're killing me...
WELLES: Don't...
AMY: What was I supposed to think happened to you?!
WELLES: Amy...
