ALLISON: We've been through this.
ALVY: If they-they recovered the shells from that rifle.
ALLISON: Okay. All right, so whatta yuh saying, now? That e-e-everybody o-o-on the Warren Commission is in on this conspiracy, right?
ALVY: Well, why not?
ALLISON: Yeah, Earl Warren?
ALVY: Hey... honey, I don't know Earl Warren.
ALLISON: Lyndon Johnson?
ALVY: L-L-Lyndon Johns Lyndon Johnson is a politician. You know the ethics those guys have? It's like-uh, a notch underneath child molester.
ALLISON: Then everybody's in in the conspiracy?
ALVY: Tsch.
ALLISON: The FBI, and the CIA, and J. Edgar Hoover and oil companies and the Pentagon and the men's-room attendant at the White House?
ALVY: I-I-I-I would leave out the men's- room attendant.
ALLISON: You're using this conspiracy theory as an excuse to avoid sex with me.
ALVY: Oh, my God! She's right! Why did I turn off Allison Portchnik? She was-she was beautiful. She was willing. She was real... intelligent. Is it the old Groucho Marx joke? That-that I-I just don't wanna belong to any club that would have someone like me for a member?
ANNIE: Alvy, now don't panic. Please.
ALVY: Look, I told you it was a... mistake to ever bring a live thing in the house.
ANNIE: Stop it! Don't... don't do that! There.
ALVY: Well, maybe we should just call the police. Dial nine-one-one, it's the lobster squad.
ANNIE: Come on, Alvy, they're only baby ones, for God's sake.
ALVY: If they're only babies, then you pick 'em up.
ANNIE: Oh, all right. All right! It's all right. Here.
ALVY: Don't give it to me. Don't!
ANNIE: Oooh! Here! Here!
ALVY: Look! Look, one crawled behind the refrigerator. It'll turn up in our bed at night. Will you get outta here with that thing? Jesus!
ANNIE: Get him!
ALVY: Talk to him. You speak shellfish! Hey, look... put it in the pot.
ANNIE: I can't! I can't put him in the pot. I can't put a live thing in hot water.
ALVY: Gimme! Gimme! Let me do it! What- what's he think we're gonna do, take him to the movies?
ANNIE: Oh, God! Here yuh go! Oh, good, now he'll think- Aaaah! Okay.
ALVY: Okay, it's in. It's definitely in the pot!
ANNIE: All right. All right. All right.
ALVY: Annie, there's a big lobster behind the refrigerator. I can't get it out. This thing's heavy. Maybe if I put a little dish of butter sauce here with a nutcracker, it will run out the other side, you know what I mean?
ANNIE: Yeah. I'm gonna get my... I'm gonna get my camera.
ALVY: You know, I-I think... if I could pry this door off... We shoulda gotten steaks 'cause they don't have legs. They don't run around.
ANNIE: Great! Great! Goddammit! Ooooh! These are... p-p-p-pick this lobster up. Hold it, please!
ALVY: All right! All right! All right! All right! Whatta yuh mean? Are yuh gonna take pictures now?
ANNIE: It'll make great- Alvy, be- Alvy, it'll be wonderful... Ooooh, lovely!
ALVY: All right, here! Oh, God, it's disgusting!
