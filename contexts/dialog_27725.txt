FETTES: Why do you want the white horse to bid you good-day"?"
GEORGINA: He was a nice horse.
FETTES: Maybe there's another reason. Maybe you haven't friends enough. Could that be it, Georgina?
GEORGINA: Of course -- I don't have friends. That's because I can't walk. I try to make myself used to it.
FETTES: One shouldn't get used to the wrong things, Georgina. You want to walk and run and play.
