Is smoking a dealbreaker for you? Why?
I [27F] just started dating this guy [28M] that I really like. The conversation is great, the chemistry is incredible, he’s a gentleman, etc. However I just found out he smokes. 

Typically smoking is a dealbreaker for me because I find it gross and it’s detrimental to your health, but I find myself rethinking this with him. 

Am I being closed minded? Or is it worth dropping something potentially amazing?

Update: he brought it up last night in a conversation about our intentions in the relationship. He told me he vapes cbd for anxiety and pain. So I’ll do some research, but we’re giving it a go!
