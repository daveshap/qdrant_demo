Are these valid concerns?
Got offered a job as a TSR in this apartment complex downtown. All I know is that they are a non profit organization who provide subsidized housing for low to middle income individuals/families. Their base salary is almost 20k more than what I currently make and the benefits are amazing. Due to the COVID19 situation, they will have me working remotely until the threat is gone. I am a recent graduate and I am struggling financially. It seems like a good opportunity for development and will allow me to pay the bills until I find a job in my field. However, I know a lot of companies tend to hide the negative aspects of working for them during the recruiting process and compensate with a higher salary, especially now during the pandemic. I was wondering whether or not some of my concerns are valid.

1. I have no idea what the office inside looks like, but the building itself is absolutely hideous - it makes me question what the atmosphere must be like. I have no idea what type of people I'll be working with for the first few weeks of employment. I don't want to be stuck with jerks or zombies for coworkers.
2. Instability - Since they are a non profit organization, there is less job security. If the funding gets suspended or the donations are low, what happens to my salary? Why is this position vacant?
3. Possible burnout - The job description mentions "the incumbent may experience considerable amounts of stress." Looks like a huge red flag.
4. $80/month for parking, having to commute downtown and back to the east end during peak hours.
