I don't want to work for the corporate world, how do I fulfill this?
Sorry if this is jumbled and a lot to read.

I'm a 22 year old male from the USA about to graduate with a degree in Software Engineering (Computer Science) in 2021. I had an internship and honestly it was the perfect job for someone going into my field, it was fun, exciting, and hands on.

I just don't feel any type of reward from working hourly paid jobs, maybe because I don't feel the direct impact of what I am doing, plus I hate belonging to a big group.

I noticed I am much more productive when I'm not following other peoples orders. For example, over the breaks I would sometimes do unassigned projects on my own, then when the next semester would start a professor would assign something similar and I would end up procrastinating and barely submit it on time while I had already completed something similar. I also work as a freelance mobile mechanic and do heavy research on the vehicles that I fix and I have a lot of enjoyment working on their cars.

In my life I had worked 12 different jobs (construction, software internships, mechanic engineering internships, Retail, etc.) and I would always think cynical thoughts to cripple the companies.

I'm currently deciding whether to just graduate and finish my degree in Software Engineering, then apply for dental school and eventually open my own practice.

My dream in life is to work less than half the year in the States, and spend the rest of the year in a Latin American country with the money I saved up working in the USA. Basically make 40k in 6 months then live in Central America for the other 6 and repeat this process.

edit: Latin American country for example would be a Guatemala or an Ecuador, something less developed, than some of the more booming markets.
