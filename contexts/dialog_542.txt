CLAUDIA: Did the hotel manager speak to you about that place nearby?
SANDRO: Yes, she started to but I didn't feel like staying to listen to what she had to say. If we had to listen to everybody...
CLAUDIA: No, Sandro... We should go. Besides, we haven't been in touch with anybody. Not even with Anna's father. We should have at least sent a wire or telephoned... let's be fair, he must be feeling awfully lonely.
SANDRO: I don't doubt it. But at a time like this we're the least suitable persons to be with him. And as far as telephoning him... Who knows where he is?
