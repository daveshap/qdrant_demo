ILSA: What makes you ask?
NICHOLAS: I'm not sure.
ILSA: All the time I've known you, you've never once asked about him.
NICHOLAS: He came to my mind recently, that's all.
ILSA: Your mother thought he was a good man. He worked very hard. What I remember most was his manner was so... slight. It was easy to spend time in a room, and not realize he'd been there the whole time.
NICHOLAS: Was he morose, or...? I mean...
ILSA: No. What happened... no one expected it.
NICHOLAS: Sometimes I wonder how much of him there is in me.
ILSA: Not much, I think.
NICHOLAS: I'm just like him.
ILSA: You're not like him at all. I don't know exactly what's going on around here lately, but don't make me start worrying about you.
NICHOLAS: Did you worry about him?
ILSA: Nobody worried about your father.
