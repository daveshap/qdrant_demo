There is a guy in my class making me really uncomfortable
Okay, so there is this guy in my physics class who keeps making fun of me and irritating me. It started with him just making comments about how I look or what I say and him telling me to 'get back to the kitchen' or 'make him a sandwich' which was irritating but I could get over it, but he has switched to a different tactic. He is now calling me his 'girlfriend' and keeps trying to touch me and keeps blowing kisses at me e.c.t. This was really annoying and uncomfortable but I dealt with it but it is getting worse, like on Thursday he hugged me from behind and whispered in my ear 'it's okay baby you can tell me what's wrong'. This made me really uncomfortable. We are both 15. I don't want to be labeled as a tout, what should I do?
