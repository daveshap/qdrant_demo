MAN: Is that for Mitch Brenner?
MELANIE: Yes.
MAN: He's not home.
MELANIE: That's all right.
MAN: He won't be back until Monday. I mean, if those birds are for him....
MELANIE: Monday?
MAN: Yes. I don't think you should leave them in the hall, do you?
MELANIE: Well, I...
MELANIE: Well, where did he go?
MAN: Bodega Bay. He goes up there every weekend.
MELANIE: Bodega Bay? Where's that?
MAN: Up on the coast. About sixty miles north of here.
MELANIE: Sixty... Oh.
MAN: About an hour and a half on the freeway. Or two if you take the coast highway.
MELANIE: Oh.
MAN: I'd hold the birds for him, but I'm going away myself. Someone's got to feed them, I suppose.
MELANIE: Yes. Yes, someone's got to feed them.
MAN: I'm awfully sorry.
