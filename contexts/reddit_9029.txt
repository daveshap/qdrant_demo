How does the Republican Party's enthusiasm for tax cuts compare to other right of center political parties among G20 countries?
In the US the Republican Party is [famous for cutting taxes](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/09/us-parties-republican-democrat-taxes.asp), most recently with the [Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.](https://taxfoundation.org/the-tax-cuts-and-jobs-act-simplified-the-tax-filing-process-for-millions-of-americans/)

However prioritizing tax cuts appears to be a relatively recent development.

[George H.W. Bush raised taxes in 1990](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnibus_Budget_Reconciliation_Act_of_1990) and famous tax-cutter Reagan [raised taxes a few times in the 80's:](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2017-12-15/the-mostly-forgotten-tax-increases-of-1982-1993)

This led me to wonder: Do other right of center political parties among other G20 countries prioritize tax cuts in the same manner as the American Republican Party?

For example, should I expect the tax policies of right of center parties in Germany and India to be similar to that of the Republican Party in the US?
