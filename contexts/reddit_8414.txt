Is it normal for House leaders to leave a vote open after the vote clock has expired in order to solicit members to change votes?
[This article from The Hill](http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/280542-dems-cry-foul-after-house-gop-votes-down-lgbt-measure) describes a recent vote which went against the goals of the US House majority party, so instead of closing the voting as normal they held the electronic voting method open until such time as they has pressured enough members to switch to their position. The article points out that this is contrary to Speaker Ryan's insistence on obeying House rules regarding the voting clock, which implies that perhaps this technique for securing votes has been used previously. Has it, or is this behavior unusual? Does the difference between keeping the electronic voting open versus requiring members to change votes publicly in "the well" matter within that context?
