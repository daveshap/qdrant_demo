PETER: Any luck?
LEONARD: Well...there's an old service elevator half a mile down the tracks. Ain't gonna be much use, though. Lines are dead.
PETER: You said those cables're still live. Can't we rewire...?
LEONARD: Oh, man, there you go again.
PETER: What?
LEONARD: Those things bring juice to the new stations. You just can't rewire that shit...
PETER: For Chrissakes, what's the problem? You need a memo every time you fart?
LEONARD: All right, motherfucker, that's it.
