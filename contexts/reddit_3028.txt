Why would somebody still hire me when I am 50?
Letâ€™s face it: the hiring market is not a charity organization, they will take the best / cheapest candidate where they have the best return on investment.
I am now in my 30s, with some decent work experience and I get invited to most of the jobs I apply for. Why would a company receiving 100 applications hire me when I am 50 for a job (not C-level) while they can find somebody in their 30s with the exact experience needed? What do I have to do to be employable then?
