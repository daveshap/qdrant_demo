MAX: That's Winston. He works here.
ORDELL: He's a big one. You two tight?
MAX: Yeah.
ORDELL: It was our idea to take the picture, wasn't it?
MAX: So, you want a ten-thousand dollar bond. What've you got for collateral?
ORDELL: Gonna have to put up cash.
MAX: You have it with you?
ORDELL: It's in my bag.
MAX: You have cash. What do you need me for?
ORDELL: C'mon, you know how they do. Black man comes in with ten thousand, they wanna fuck with 'em. First off, they gonna wanna know where I got it. Second, they gonna keep a big chunk of it -- start talkin' that court cost shit. Fuck that shit, Jack. I'll go through you.
MAX: Cost you a thousand for the bond.
ORDELL: I know that.
MAX: Who's it for? A relative?
ORDELL: Fella named Beaumont. They have him up at county. It started out drunk driving, but they wrote it up possession of a concealed weapon." Dumb monkey-ass had a pistol on him."
MAX: Ten thousand sounds high.
ORDELL: They ran his name and got a hit. He's been in before.
MAX: He takes off and I gotta go to Kentucky to bring him back, you pay the expenses.
ORDELL: You think you could do that?
