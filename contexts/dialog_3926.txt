HELEN: Mutants?!
CALVIN: It's not a pretty sight. Some eat out of garbage cans. Others are...cover your ears, Son, and hum. I mean that literally and I mean right now!
CALVIN: Others are...multi-sexual. It seems...they can be both masculine and feminine...simultaneously.
HELEN: No.
CALVIN: Yes.
HELEN: I don't believe it!
