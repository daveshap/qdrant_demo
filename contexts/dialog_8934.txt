JACK: Nina?
SUSIE: Who's Nina?
JACK: Friend.
SUSIE: Friend? What's she look like? Maybe I can help you find her.
JACK: She's four feet tall. Ed?
SUSIE: Ed? How many people live here?
JACK: I have to make him some chili. Okay?
SUSIE: Sure.
SUSIE: Like diamonds, huh? I never get over it. When I was a little girl, my mama'd stand me before the window and tell me to close my eyes and make a wish.Like I could reach out and grab all the lights of the city and string them into-a necklace for myself. She'd take my hand and when she closed her eyes, I don't know, it was like she really believed it.
JACK: How come you didn't close your eyes?
