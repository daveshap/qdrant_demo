How do I tell potential employer I quit my last job in a professional way?
Hey all, I have an interview coming up and I know they are going to ask me why I left my last job. I'm trying to figure out how to be professional about it. In short, my values were no longer in alignment with theirs. While that sentence is short, it also says a lot.  I'm just worried that I'm choosing the wrong words. The second worry is that I don't want to use my last boss as a reference (because of the reasons I quit) and so I am worried about how that will look. I do have other references and one will be a coworker as professional and character reference as we worked side by side and she knows more of the work I did and produced than my boss did. Any tips or suggestions? Thanks for reading.
