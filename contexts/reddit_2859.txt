How to stay calm and separate work anxiety from my personal life?
Hi,
I work as a financial analyst and recently things have been very very high stress. I recently was assigned a new department 3 weeks ago. My director demands immediate & accurate results, while everything I turn in never seems good enough. I’m expected to take ownership of my own work and to figure things out on my own (about the department because my director is fairly new as well and doesn’t have the bandwidth or knowledge of how things were done in the department in the past to answer all my questions). Basically, every night I dream about work and barely can rest peacefully. Even when I nap on weekends, I am scared to check my phone in case I see a message..and whenever I do, my heart skips a beat and my anxiety is activated. I don’t have an appetite at work and I think I’ve lost 2-4lbs in these past 2 weeks. I really want to be able to relax on the weekend without thinking of the impending doom that is the weekday...please, does anyone have any tips on how to separate work and personal life? I’m the type of person who gets fixated on things easily, so it’s hard to be 100% present with my friends/family because my mind wanders back to work. I don’t want to look for a new job yet because this is my first job out of college, and a lot of the positions I see in other companies require at least 1-2 years of experience in finance. And I’ve tried methods of distraction (watching TV, exercising, socializing), but my mood is ALWAYS ruined the minute I see another message from my director, and I lose motivation/joy in those activities. I just want to be able to look at a message and be able to write off any emotion until Monday so I can properly recharge, sleep, & enjoy my weekend.
