Job has a start date as the 1st of the month, but new employee orientation is the 7th of the month?
Because my job offer letter says start date is 1st of month, originally I assumed that I was supposed to report for work on the 1st. It sounds like they don't go over benefits or anything until the new employee orientation on the 7th. Not sure whether to go to work on the 1st or 7th? This is a major university. My thoughts are to ask HR, but thought I would get some input here first thanks!
