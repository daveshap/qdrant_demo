I need help with my mincraft commands So I'm making a minecraft map, and what I need help with is this: the player puts 4 nether stars in a chest. Then they get teleported to a new area. I need to have it set up so that they can't put any random items in the chest and teleport away, and I don't know what commands I need to use to have this happen. Basically, I need the chest to detect the nether stars when they are put in the chest teleport the player to a new location after the items are detected, and destroy the items once the player is teleported to the new area. Could someone please help me with all of the commands I will need to use if this is even possible?
