One simple thing a girl I was talking to said to me caused a big hit to my psyche
About a month ago a girl I've kind of known for awhile from work started blatantly hitting on me on night and was very forward with how much she liked me. She's really cute and I thought I'd be interested in getting to know her better too so that night I mustered up the courage to get her number and for a week or so we texted back and forth a good amount and I was getting ready to ask her out to a Cleveland Indians baseball game over the weekend.

At work word quickly spread that I asked for her number and that we started talking and immediately one day I felt bombarded by a group of coworkers and a couple managers, and they were either saying a some things about her, asking what we've done and what we're going to do and just wouldn't stop getting involved in my business and that kind of scared me a little bit but I tried playing it cool. 

The next day or both the girl and I were working the same shift and lets just say I had a ton of anxiety built up regarding when the appropriate time was to ask her out, how I was going to do it, and what kind of stuff to talk with her beforehand and I was so trapped in my own head and thoughts that I shut down and barely uttered a word to her that entire night until she came up and asked "Where've you been all night?"

 I have a hard time opening up and expressing my emotions a lot of the time when I went to her and told her about how I was feeling after basically feeling *interrogated* by everyone else and explained to her how that was the reason why I hadn't said much, she responded with a simple "you need take a chill pill, dude." That was basically when we stopped talking and things have been pretty awkward between us since. That lone comment made my general anxiety even worse and it completely changed the way I interact with people. I've been much more quiet and reserved at work since, keeping to myself for the most part and haven't been my previous outgoing self since and I think most people have noticed that. I'm in a pretty weird funk right now.
