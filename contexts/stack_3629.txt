Does using two layers of encryption reduce security (Veracrypt/Truecrypt)? If I decided to do a full disk encryption, or simply encrypt the partition of a disk, then put a encrypted file container which contains sensitive files inside it for a little extra peace of mind, how does that effect security?I ask this because I'm always hearing some people say that layers of encryption effects the overall security of your... whatever. So is any of this true? If so explain HOW please. thank you.I'm aware of the speed implications of putting so many layers of encryption and don't care. What I do care about is whether or not this method affects my overall security.
