When you get anxiety because you finally feel relief from anxiety and youâ€™re not sure how long it will last
I have been struggling hard with overwhelming anxiety over my job and the environment. Earlier today I felt some relief and was actually feeling happy and then the anxiety creeped back in; knowing the happiness will fade and anxiety will take its place. 

Does anyone else experience this?
