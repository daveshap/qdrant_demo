Can I be a contact tracer for a different state?
I'm a college student currently living in Nashville, TN, and I'm having trouble finding job applications for contact tracers in my area. I only found one application, and I want to have a remote backup plan in case that application doesn't work out for me.

As I continued my contract tracer job search, I noticed that there were plenty of openings in Kentucky. Some of these openings would pay me more than the one I applied for in Nashville. I was thinking about applying for a job in Kentucky, but since I don't live in Kentucky and don't want to break any rules, I thought I'd take my question to the internet to answer. Is it okay for me to apply for a fully-remote contract tracing job in another state?
