Is it correct to say \"proud of having met you\or should it be \"proud to have met\"? Is it correct to say \"I have proud of having  met both of you\"I am proud of having met both of you. (past present?)I am proud to have met both of you. (present perfect?)What does the first one say? The word \"having\" sounds like it is happening, but it was done already. Is it right?The second one sounds like it happened in the past. Does it mean it is finished? Inconclusive?
