Accepted a job offer over email before COVID. Should I look for other jobs now?
So after months of searching, I finally got accepted for what was hopefully going to be the start of a lucrative career. Then COVID happened.

I accepted the job and was given a start date and everything but luckily before I gave in my notice I asked if they still wanted me and they said they were thankful I hadn't done anything yet. We agreed over the phone to postpone my start date until things calmed down (this was 2 weeks before our lockdown in the UK).

I've spoken to my would-be manager twice since then over LinkedIn, mostly just seeing how we're doing on each side etc. The problem is that their company is in 2 sectors which never do well in recessions, and have been hit particularly hard during COVID. As far as I can tell, they're doing okay though (nothing in the news about their collapse and linkedin etc seems to be BAU).

I haven't asked directly about when they're planning on having me back as the manager said that they're just surviving the next few weeks/months for now.

Based on the info I've given here, does it sound likely I'm still going to have a future at that company? More importantly though, is it worth me just applying for other companies? I hate my job and the moment and I feel trapped, but I don't want to awkwardly/directly ask if they still have the position for me at the job I was already accepted for.
