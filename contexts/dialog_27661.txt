MITCH: Deke, have you got a first aid kit back there?
DEKE: What happened?
MITCH: Young woman cut herself.
DEKE: Shall I call the doctor?
MITCH: I don't think it's that serious. You want to sit up here?
DEKE: You cut yourself outside, Miss?
MITCH: Stop worrying, Deke. She was in a boat.
DEKE: I had a man trip and fall in the parking lot once, sued me before I could bat an eyelash.
MITCH: I don't think Miss Daniels is going to sue anybody.
DEKE: Well, you're the lawyer.
MELANIE: What's that?
MITCH: Just some peroxide. I want to clean out the cut.
MELANIE: So you're a lawyer.
MITCH: That's right. What are you doing in Bodega Bay?
MELANIE: Do you practice here?
MITCH: No, San Francisco. What are you...?
MELANIE: What kind of law?
MITCH: Criminal.
MELANIE: Is that why you'd like to see everyone behind bars?
MITCH: Not everyone, Miss Daniels.
MELANIE: Only violators and practical jokers.
