My friend has anxiety and recently just told me that he’s suicidal
A friend of mine admitted that he was feeling suicidal. I already knew he had anxiety. We’re in middle school (getting ready for HS) and I’m terrified he’ll start cutting himself or try to commit suicide. His parents already know about the situation, at least I think so, but they haven’t taken him to get therapy or to the doctors. I told him he can text me during school if he needs me to help him calm down. I have no idea how to calm someone who’s having an anxiety attack down, same goes for depression/suicidal thoughts.
Just the thought of him having an attack and me not being there to help him makes me sick to my stomach and I feel really guilty when I’m out of school sick.
How do I help him? I’m so scared every time I don’t see him at school that something happened, and that it was my fault for not being there often enough.
