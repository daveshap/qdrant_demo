VINCENT: Here's yours.
FRANCOIS: There's been a slight problem.
VINCENT: What's that?
FRANCOIS: If you say a word in English, Vincent, my friend with the high powered sporting rifle will shoot you in the throat. Sorry to screw you over like this, but the information you want might get me killed if I give it to you, and that's a price I'm not willing to pay.
VINCENT: I take it you still want the money...
FRANCOIS: Of course.
VINCENT: Where's my information?
FRANCOIS: In here...
VINCENT: Then you better find it in your heart to tell me, Francois, because while your death is inevitable, it still isn't decided how painful it's going to be.
