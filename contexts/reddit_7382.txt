Question: In tech interviews, what's your experience with male vs. female interviewers discriminating based on looks, height, weight, age, school, etc.
My experience is males and females seem to have some conscious or subconscious bias in tech interviews.   I'll hold off on my experiences, but was just wondering if anyone else had some experience with this.
