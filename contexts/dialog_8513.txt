ED: I don't know what to say.
ERIN: Say you were wrong.
ED: I was wrong.
ERIN: Say you shortchanged me and you shortchanged yourself.
ED: I did. Both.
ERIN: Say you'd be the luckiest son of a bitch on Earth if I didn't up and quit over all this.
ED: The luckiest son of a bitch in the universe, Erin. The luckiest son of a bitch in history.
ED: But I know you're not gonna quit on me.
ERIN: How do you know that?
ED: Cause you got a little voice in your head saying, do the right thing. Give him another chance.
