Spend $120 for forklift certification? I have no job skills and am partially mentally disabled.
Richland Community College in NE Dallas is offering a 2 Saturday class, 9 hours total, for forklift certification. I have no job skills, and I just lost a simple job after a short period due to mental dysfunction. I still collect SSDI/Medicare. I am not of sound judgement. Maybe this work is too dangerous for me. I have about $1400. I'd like to get my teeth fixed, and get some trauma therapy. But yeah, $120 is a good investment. Military service, Level II Security License, Forklift Certification. If I become homeless driving my father crazy, this is a good way to land a job, and low wage jobs often add $5 or so to the hourly wage if you can drive a forklift. My problem has always been holding a job.

I hate making eye contact with anyone, I avoid the potential for intimacy by not being around women, I fear authority figures, and my working memory is absolute shit. I might have to explain to my next employer that it took me 20 years to realize I had been molested before puberty.
