JESSIE: Gabe!?
GABE: What are you doing here!?
JESSIE: Looking for Hal. Oh my God, I heard someone kick the door open...you came back.
GABE: How'd you get up here?
JESSIE: Frank dropped me in the west valley and I hiked. You look frozen. What's happening?!
GABE: You got to go back now!
JESSIE: Where's Hal, what's going on?
