how to begin my analysis? panel data, lots of missingness, and around 100 variables I have an extremely unbalanced panel dataset over ten time periods\uff0c with a large percentage of missingness, and a high number of mixed types variables and the dependent variable is binary. I want to ask:1. how to select independent variables across the time period? 2. how to deal with missingness? some of the variables with over 90% missingness3. which goes first? Variables selection or imputation?finally, the software I can use is STATA SAS and R, but R is just beginner level.Thanks
