KIRKHILL: Memo E-7 on top will cover the details. An abandoned Vietnamese Army base in the North-central highlands may have a compound used as an internment camp. As you can see the intelligence is soft. These LANDSAT photos show huts... barracks. It could be anything.
RAMBO: What's the plan?
KIRKHILL: This operation is in two phases. Recon and rescue. You are phase one. Your two-man team will probe the site, confirm the presence of American POWs, if any, make photographic and tactical observations, then proceed to the extraction point without engaging the enemy.
RAMBO: We don't try to pull out any of our guys if we find them?
KIRKHILL: Negative. Absolutely not. The phase two assault team will get them out.
RAMBO: We just take pictures?
KIRKHILL: Don't look so disappointed. It should be hairy enough... even for you.
