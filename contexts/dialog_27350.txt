LORENSON: It's important for you to know who your father was, isn't it?
STARKS: [Beat] Yeah, it is.
STARKS: Exactly.
LORENSON: Well... [beat] let me know how your search turns out.
STARKS: [Beat] We will.
STARKS: I don't believe a thing she just said.
JACKIE: Me neither. Who was the boy she was talking about, Eugene?
STARKS: I have no idea.
JACKIE: You think Lorenson kills you?
STARKS: Maybe. I don't know. Seems more likely Becker does, but at the very least she knows how I died.
JACKIE: Let's see if they have an address for Becker. I also want to figure out more about the kid you helped her with.
STARKS: Why?
JACKIE: Because that's the part I believe is true. You probably did help her somehow with the boy and Eugene's name did come up over and over again on the abstracts I pulled.
