ANNIE: I don't mean to pry, but I've read in two magazines now where you were seeing this model who does those disgusting jeans commercials. And I said it can't be true. Paul Sheldon would never waste his time with a trampy woman like that.
PAUL: Well, you can't believe everything you read in magazines.
ANNIE: I knew it. I knew it wasn't true. Boy, how do they get away with printing stuff like that?
PAUL: You'd be amazed at what some people will believe.
ANNIE: Thank you so much.
PAUL: My pleasure.
ANNIE: I thought it was time you two should meet. Paul, say hello to my favorite beast in all the world, my sow, Misery.
PAUL: Misery?
ANNIE: Yes. I told you I was your number- one fan.
PAUL: I'm getting to believe you.
ANNIE: This farm was getting kind of dreary, what with just the few cows and chickens and me-- But when I got Misery here, everything Changed--she just makes me smile so.
PAUL: She's a fine... uh... pig is what she is...
ANNIE: I'm on page three-hundred now, Paul, and it's better than perfect--it's divine. What's the ceiling that dago painted?
PAUL: The Sistine Chapel?
ANNIE: Yeah, that and Misery's Child--those are the only two divine things ever in this world...
