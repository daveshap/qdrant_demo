KITTY: You read Eddie's Chase Manhattan Bombing summation in the Leftist Law anthology?
ROGER: -- Eddie told you?
KITTY: My skip-trace turned up two Cecil Stipes. One's in Butte, Montana. Other's at Riverhead Veterans Psychiatric.
ROGER: I'll take odds on Cecil Number Two.
KITTY: So what'd this guy do? Snitch off a dealer?
EDDIE: Murder witness.
KITTY: You're doing a murder case?
EDDIE: It hasn't been that long.
EDDIE: Stipe was just one of four eyewitnesses who came forward, Kitty. Y'oughta start looking for the others...
KITTY: Eddie, I'm not working on this case. You boys have fun.
