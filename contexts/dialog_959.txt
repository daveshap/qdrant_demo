CASSIE: A pair of incomings. They popped-up on the medium-range about thirteen twenty-four local time.
PARSONS: We figured on it being a magnetic anomaly, but we ran a back-trace just to make sure.
CASSIE: Yeah. Turns out they dropped straight out of hyperspace.
CASSIE: Curious thing is, the mass detector says they're too small to carry a deep-space drive.
HIROKO: Sounds like a couple of escape shuttles.
PARSONS: That's what we thought.
HIROKO: Have you got an updated Lloyds' Almanac to cross-reff them through?
PARSONS: Done it already. Nothing matches.
