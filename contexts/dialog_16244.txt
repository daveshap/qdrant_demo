HATCHET: I will.
EDDY: You will what?
HATCHET: I will loan you the money.
EDDY: I think I would rather just turn them over.
HATCHET: I am not interested in what you would rather; I want to keep going. I am also offering you the money, so we don't have to turn them over because you can borrow.
EDDY: I need two hundred and fifty grand.
HATCHET: No, you need five hundred grand to see me.
EDDY: That's if I want to see you.
HATCHET: Well, you're going to have a problem carrying on, aintcha.
