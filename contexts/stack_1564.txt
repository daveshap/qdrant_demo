turning off an ATX-PSU Converting an ATX PSU to a bench supply i found out how to start it by shorting the green wire to ground with a Push-button, and that I have to place a minimum load (preferably on the rail with highest amp rating) to keep it running.What I want is another Push-button to shut it down again.(I don\u00b4t want to use a on/off switch between green and ground, I also dont want to use the on/off switch on the back of the PSU)How does a mainboard turn off the PSU? does it simply disconnect all loads? if so, how can I achieve this for all rails (3.3, 5, -5, 12, -12) with a single Push-button?
