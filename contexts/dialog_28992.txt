SALLY: I'm crazy about the kid and I got him into it. What do you want me to do?
LOTHER: Just smile again and be reasonable. I'll order dinner here--just the two of us--like old times.
SALLY: --and you swear when you get to the other side, you'll never come near either of us again?
LOTHER: That's a bet--but I couldn't let you walk out like that, Sally. I'd have gone cuckoo back there--just thinking about you--
SALLY: Don't, Lee--that's dead.
LOTHER: Let's see if I can bring it back to life.
