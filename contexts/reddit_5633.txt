Got a job offer but thinking of declining because it pays less than unemployment
After I was laid off in March, I immediately began looking for work. Once the recent stimulus bill rolled out, I applied for UI and took advantage of the extra $600 per week that was being doled out. 

I finally got a callback for an interview for a work from home position and got the job on the spot. The thing is, the job pays 75% of what I currently get in UI. Effectively, I’d make more money collecting unemployment than working 8 hours, 6 days a week with this latest job offer. 

I’m considering declining the offer just to keep my benefits, but can’t help feel unethical about the whole thing because I was offered work. What would you do in my position?
