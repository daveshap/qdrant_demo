SAAVIK: Request permission to beam aboard immediately.
ESTEBAN: Saavik... Does Dr. Marcus think there could be -- any chance of -- ah -- radioactive contamination?
SAAVIK: None that I can detect, sir.
ESTEBAN: Well, all the same, I'm going to advise Starfleet and get instructions.
SAAVIK: I'm sure Starfleet would approve, sir.
ESTEBAN: I know, but -- let's do it by the book. Stand by on this channel. Go.
