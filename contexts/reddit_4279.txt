Come on guys
I’m a female (24) and I am so tired of trying to carry a conversation. Things were going good on the app itself (bumble) but then we moved our talking over to Snapchat and just like that I get nothing but a picture of his face with no fucking text or questions asked. So I send the same shit back and I get left on read. Yeah no, do these dudes just expect you to stick around and hope they’ll get better at communicating? I just straight told him I’m going to pass because the lack of conversation is unappealing and it’s just so one sided. Here’s a tip when talking to a girl fucking ask her some questions! Get to know her! If I ask you a question why not just respond with the answer and a simple hbu? I just don’t get it. If your bumble says you’re after a relationship don’t you think you would try?? Ugh I’m just glad I’m getting better at calling these guys out and just moving on.
