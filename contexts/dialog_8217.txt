HICKS: We found two sets of latent prints in the rubble of Brill's studio. One was Dean's. The other, we believe, belongs to Brill.
REYNOLDS: We believe?
HICKS: Well...his real name's Edward Lyle.
REYNOLDS: Lyle?!
HICKS: Yes sir.
REYNOLDS: You're kidding me.
HICKS: No sir.
REYNOLDS: Dean's with Lyle.
HICKS: And they have the video. That's confirmed.
REYNOLDS: So they know everything.
HICKS: If they've looked at the video.
REYNOLDS: Oh, let's assume that they have.
HICKS: If he's with Lyle it means he's got resources.
REYNOLDS: Resources, that's a good point. He's got resources. All we've got is a <i>six-hundred billion dollar</i> <i>organization!</i> Now god<u>dammit</u>, Hicks, you find 'em. You find 'em and you end it now!
