China's President has suggested China's government could serve as a model for the world. Disregarding subjective 'ethic' things like rights and freedom of speech, what are the actual pros and cons of the current Chinese model?

Basis for this question is that China is often condemned for it's lack of rights or abuses of such. However the authoritarian control they have means they can be quite effective for such a large country in implementing any changes such as environmental based policies or clamping down on corruption. Censorship and constant control can stifle knowledge and new ideas, however also help keep from having to deal with large internal conflict over how to progress or going back and forth in policies or trying to cater to public for votes.

If we consider things from a more 'common/greater good' of humanity or the people in general as opposed to what we 'ideally should have' with freedoms and access. What are the pros and cons are of the Chinese model as it stands currently?
