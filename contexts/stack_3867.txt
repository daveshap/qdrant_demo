Time Series Analysis and Classification I need to classify data that changes over time. A good example is stock prices. My problem is that stock prices examples are trying to predict the next price and I need to classify the data.I looked at text classifiers but they are based on human text.Another example is credit score classification in which the data is income and expenses of people. The target is to classify the data to groups. It can be reinforces learning as each sample belongs to a woman/man/couple/young/aged, etc. Or it can be that the classifier finds new classes.So can anyone help with a code example/references on how to classify data that changes over time?
