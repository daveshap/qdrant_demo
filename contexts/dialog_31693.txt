FREDDY: All right then, I suppose I owe the family that much. You'll have everything ready for me when I arrive?
HERR FALKSTEIN: Yes, sir.
FREDDY: One week at the most!?
HERR FALKSTEIN: One week -- I'll see to it, sir.
FREDDY: Well, thank you very much for all your trouble.
HERR FALKSTEIN: Not at all -- a great privilege, Doctor.
FREDDY: Saturday night then! I'll take the train to New York and fly from there.
HERR FALKSTEIN: Saturday night, yes, sir. Have a pleasant journey!
ELIZABETH: Darling!...you will be careful!?
FREDDY: Of course.
ELIZABETH: You have your tickets?
FREDDY: Yes.
ELIZABETH: And your passport?
FREDDY: Yes, don't worry.
ELIZABETH: Call me from New York before you leave??
FREDDY: Yes.
ELIZABETH: Promise??
FREDDY: I promise.
ELIZABETH: Oh, darling -- I'll count the hours that you're away.
FREDDY: Oh, darling -- so will I.
