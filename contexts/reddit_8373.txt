What are the powers of Congress to enforce subpoenas against the President and executive branch?
Recently, several disputes have arisen over subpoenas issued by the House of Representatives to Trump administration officials.  

In particular:

* The [White House directed a former security clearance official Carl Kline not to testify before the House Oversight committee despite a subpoena.](https://www.lawfareblog.com/documents-white-house-orders-former-official-defy-congressional-subpoena-congress-responds)  Kline [wrote the committee](https://oversight.house.gov/sites/democrats.oversight.house.gov/files/documents/eLtr.%20to%20Cummings%20and%20Jordan%2020190422.pdf) to say he would not comply with their subpoena due to the White House request.

* Donald Trump in his personal capacity sued [the House Oversight committee and his accounting firm](https://www.lawfareblog.com/document-trump-sues-house-oversight-chairman-and-accounting-firm-over-tax-returns) to prevent his accounting firm from turning over financial records to the Oversight committee pursuant to a subpoena.

* DoJ civil rights division official [John Gore](https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/justice-department-refuses-to-comply-with-congressional-subpoena-for-testimony-on-citizenship-question-and-2020-census/2019/04/24/d132996a-66a6-11e9-a1b6-b29b90efa879_story.html) told the Oversight committee yesterday he would not attend a deposition he was subpoenaed to attend related to the citizenship question on the 2020 census.

* The Treasury Department [said they would not yet turn over Trump's tax returns under 26 USC 6103(f)](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/Secretary-Mnuchin-Response-to-Chairman-Neal-Plus-Appendix-A.pdf) after the Ways and Means Committee invoked that statutory authority to demand them [earlier this month.](https://waysandmeans.house.gov/sites/democrats.waysandmeans.house.gov/files/documents/Neal%20Letter%20to%20Rettig%20(signed\)%20-%202019.04.03.pdf) 

* The White House directed former White House counsel Don McGahn [not to testify to the House Judiciary committee under a subpoena about matters he discussed with Mueller and which appeared in Mueller's report.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/white-house-plans-to-fight-house-subpoena-of-former-counsel-donald-mcgahn-for-testimony-on-mueller-report/2019/04/23/2d48732a-65f1-11e9-83df-04f4d124151f_story.html)

* President Trump has publicly commented that [he intends to fight "all" House subpoenas.](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/24/us/politics/donald-trump-subpoenas.html)

Given all of these disputes, I have the following questions:

* **What are the legal merits of the particular refusals to comply listed above?**

* **Is there any precedent for the executive branch to categorically ignore or defy all subpoenas from Congress regardless of subject matter?**

* **What means does the House have at its disposal to compel enforcement of subpoenas and other statutory document requests?**
