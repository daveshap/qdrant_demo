Looking for more evidence in the Russia election hacking situation
So in this whole Russia election hacking story, I know of two "hacks": that resulted in the release of information - Podesta's emails and the DNC server.


I have no clue about electronic internet forensics but I do know that news is like an iceberg...we only see the tip, and it likely looks different from various angles.

After the president's recent comments about "it could be Russia, it could be others...we don't know" I started digging a little further as it appears that all the reporting has been that it was most certainly Russia.


In trying to understand more I came across at least two articles related to the DNC hack which clearly state that the DNC has never allowed any outside intelligence or investigative body access to their servers -


From January - http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/05/politics/fbi-russia-hacking-dnc-crowdstrike/index.html


Just recently - http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/jul/5/dnc-email-server-most-wanted-evidence-for-russia-i/


Is there any other corroborating evidence that can be gathered outside of the server that substantiates the claims of this private company?


Is there evidence that this private company can provide that could not possibly be faked or misleading that investigators can use to make their determinations?


In regards to the Podesta emails - I have seen no stories regarding NSA, CIA, or FBI investigators reviewing the information, but I am also aware that they would most likely not comment on ongoing investigations. I did however find articles stating that "private cyber security" firms confirm that the Russians were the source of the phishing scam

Here's one - http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/28/politics/phishing-email-hack-john-podesta-hillary-clinton-wikileaks/index.html


And another - https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/21/us/private-security-group-says-russia-was-behind-john-podestas-email-hack.html

Same questions apply. 

 
Lastly, were there attempted hacks of any republicans or the RNC that did not get the same amount of press coverage because they were unsuccessful?
