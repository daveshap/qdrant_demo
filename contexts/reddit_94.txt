My personality adapts and mirrors that of my peers
Okay, i don’t really know the best way to describe this. i’m a senior in high school and depending on my social setting or which group of friends i’m with my personality severely changes and it’s not a conscious act that i’m making it’s just what it is. Basically, my need for advice comes from the fact that i’ll be graduating soon and plan on having a grad party which i will have to invite all of my closest friends to, this is where the biggest personality splits come from, and i’m kind of scared if i will be able to function with both ends of my friends there. idk what to do please help

example, say i’m with friends A and i’ll act obnoxious, cracking jokes, basically never serious and kind over the top. however, when i’m with friends B i’ll be more laid back and chilled out, ready for a conversation about existential crisis or whatever it may be.
