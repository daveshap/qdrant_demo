ROSS: Pig Woman agreed to take a test.
BERLIN: I think I got something - twenty two years old, dark hair - study- ing mathematics - - Last seen <u>5 weeks ago</u> ..
GOODRIDGE: As recent as we have .. What ex- actly is your interest in Amber?
BERLIN: I'm afraid I can't give you an ans- wer to that, Mr Goodridge. As I ex- plained to your secretary, we're do- ing a lotta looking, but we're not even sure it's her we're lookin for ..
GOODRIDGE: Then what are you hoping I'm gon- na do? Dissuade, or persuade you?
BERLIN: I was hopin since we spoke that you might have remembered something that would give us an idea where she is?
GOODRIDGE: Then you could have saved yourself a lot of driving, Sergeant. What I said on the phone's the same as I'm saying now. I got no idea where Amb- er is, or who it was took her there.
ROSS: A blind girl can just walk out of here, and you don't know who with?
GOODRIDGE: You find something curious in that?
ROSS: Yeah, I guess I do.
GOODRIDGE: Then let me put your mind at ease .. Firstly, Amber isn't blind" - she has some useful vision - and second
ROSS: And you got <u>no</u> <u>idea</u> with who?
GOODRIDGE: No, Sergeant, I got <u>no</u> <u>idea</u> with who. And I might add, that in another six weeks, a hundred and fifty students will be leaving here, & driving away for their Christmas holidays with pe- ople whose name I-won't-know-either ..
BERLIN: Yes, Sir.
GOODRIDGE: As she's a member of my staff, may I ask what this is about?
BERLIN: Well, apparently, she saw Amber the weekend she left, & was briefly in the room with the guy she left with.
GOODRIDGE: I see .. Well, she's teaching an- other class at four .. I'd apprec- iate it if you don't detain her ..
ROSS: Where is everyone?
BERLIN: I dunno .. I guess this is staff side of the building?
HELENA: What d'you wanna ask, Mr Ross?
BERLIN: I'm Mr Berlin. Mr Ross is right here. And Mr Ross is maybe gonna take a few notes, if that's O.K.? O.K. .. I'd like you to tell me in what ever way you want, what you can remember about the time you spent with Amber on the aft- ernoon she left? Take your time, and nothing's too trivial, O.K.
HELENA: Well, I think I told you on the phone .. I went up to her room to say good-bye, and we just sat on the bed and chatted a while, while her friend was coming in and out collecting her things ..
BERLIN: What kind of friend? Was he a boy friend? An old friend? New friend?
