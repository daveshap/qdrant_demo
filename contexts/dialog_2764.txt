CHARLIE: Howdy, neighbor.
BARTON: Charlie. How are you.
CHARLIE: Jesus, I hope I'm not interrupting you again. I heard you walking around in here. Figured I'd drop by.
BARTON: Yeah, come in Charlie. Hadn't really gotten started yet – what happened to your ear?
CHARLIE: Oh, yeah. An ear infection, chronic thing. Goes away for a while, but it always comes back. Gotta put cotton in it to staunch the flow of pus. Don't worry, it's not contagious.

CHARLIE: Mine have passed on. It's just the three of us now...
CHARLIE: ...What's the expression – me myself and I.
BARTON: Sure, that's tough, but in a sense, we're all alone in this world aren't we Charlie? I'm often surrounded by family and friends, but...
