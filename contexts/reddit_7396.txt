[Rant] Not to sound like a jerk, but I’m so sick of students constantly coming to me instead of the professor because I’m a “nice” TA
I really do enjoy teaching and tutoring, and I put a lot of work into teaching my labs/recitations. I’m not too much of a softy, but I am very friendly. Unfortunately, this has resulted in students constantly coming to me to ask for absolutely anything they can think of. Questions about exams, questions about their grade, questions about the technology for inputting their grades, questions about rounding up their grade, questions about getting excused absences for lecture (which I don’t teach), questions about things not even related to the course. No matter how many times I firmly redirect them to the professor, there’s always more.

I have been told so many times by students that they’d rather talk to me because emailing or going to the prof’s office hours is “scary”. The last prof I taught for was one of the nicest people I have ever met, possibly Mormon, and about 5’ tall; HOW IS THAT SCARY? I am happy to clarify anything unclear or help with material, but I feel like I’m getting punished for being a nice and enthusiastic TA by making students practically refuse to talk to the professor. 

Some of y’all undergrads need to grow up and learn that it’s not “scary” to go talk to your own instructor, especially when it has to do with matters I can’t help you with! I have anxiety too, I get it, but c’mon. 

Sigh. Rant over.
