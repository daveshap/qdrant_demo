BRODSKI: Blowing the walkway? You come up with that yourself?
BOEMAN: Rizzo did.
THORGAN: Kay-Em!
BOEMAN: What are you doing back?!!
KAY-EM 14: Sumbitch won't be giving us anymore trouble.
RIZZO: You killed him?
KAY-EM 14: Blew half his skull away, one leg, one arm and left his entrails stretched across the lab. And look at me! I'm covered in his filthy blood!
THORGAN: You did good, Kay-Em. I'm proud of you.
KAY-EM 14: A real mamma's boy that one. Dissed his mamma and he nearly threw a tantrum. Little good it did him.
RIZZO: His mother?
BOEMAN: What?
RIZZO: I don't know. Nothing.
