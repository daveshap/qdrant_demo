LARCH: First pregnancy?
HOMER: Yes, for both.
LARCH: I presume you'd prefer handling the delivery.
HOMER: All I said was, I don't want to perform abortions. I have no argument with *you* performing them.
LARCH: You know *how* to help these women-- how can you not feel *obligated* to help them when they can't get help anywhere else?
HOMER: One: it's illegal. Two: I didn't ask how to do it--you just showed me.
LARCH: What *else* could I have showed you, Homer? The only thing I can teach you is what I know! In every life, you've got to be of use.
