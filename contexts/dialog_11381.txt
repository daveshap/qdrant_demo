MRS. ROBINSON: Thank you.
BEN: Right.
MRS. ROBINSON: Will you come in, please?
BEN: What?
MRS. ROBINSON: I want you to come in till I get the lights on.
BEN: What for?
MRS. ROBINSON: Because I don't feel safe until I get the lights on.
MRS. ROBINSON: Would you mind walking ahead of me to the sun porch. I feel funny about coming into a dark house.
BEN: But it's light in there now.
MRS. ROBINSON: Please.
MRS. ROBINSON: What do you drink? Bourbon?
BEN: Look -- I drove you home. I was glad to do it. But I have some things on my mind. Can you understand that?
BEN: All right then.
MRS. ROBINSON: What do you drink?
MRS. ROBINSON: Benjamin -- I'm sorry to be this way, but I don't want to be alone in this house.
BEN: Why not?
MRS. ROBINSON: Please wait till my husband gets home.
BEN: When is he coming back?
MRS. ROBINSON: I don't know.
MRS. ROBINSON: Drink?
BEN: No.
BEN: Are you always this much afraid of being alone?
MRS. ROBINSON: Yes.
BEN: Well, why can't you just lock the doors and go to bed?
MRS. ROBINSON: I'm very neurotic.
