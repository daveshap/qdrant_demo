My nipples [Explanation inside]
I am a 17 year old male and I have extremely puffy nipples. I'm also a really skinny guy, so you can imagine how awkward it looks to see my little ronis poking through my shirt. They make me very self concious when I wear T-Shirts because you can see them through my shirt. I pretty much only wear hoodies and button-down shirts because of how self concious I am about them. It's honestly the only physical feature I have that embarasses me, and I can't fix it.

Yea, this seems extremely ridiculous and stupid compared to some of the stuff on this sub, but it's been bothering me for 3 years and I finally decided to rant about it.
