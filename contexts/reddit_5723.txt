6 months pregnant and unemployed
Recently relocated and resigned from a management position in order to further advance fiancé’s career. 

However, I am on the job hunt again! Any advice for being a 6 month pregnant, degree holding, motorcycle racing, powersports enthusiast, saleswoman? 

I’ve been actively applying. It seems a bit daunting in the area I’m located in (Houston), as there are a million other applicants behind me (or so it feels). 

Thanks y’all!!
