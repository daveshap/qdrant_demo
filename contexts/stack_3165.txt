What was that movie? (Creepy children edition) I saw a movie on television as a kid and have wondered for years what it was.  I haven't been able to find any clues online.  What I remember about the plot is that it begins with two men in the last railcar of a train that becomes separated from the rest of the train and rolls away down the tracks out of control until it comes to rest in a small town.  They discover all the children have some odd mutation(?) so that they have (from what I remember) dark rings under their eyes and elongated heads.  They somewhat remind me of the children in Village of the Damned -- but it definitely was not that movie.  The children are also very intelligent and mature -- adult-like -- and may possess some sinister supernatural powers (again, like in Village of the Damned), but I can't remember the specifics.  There's also woman in this town that the men meet who's trying to help these children, to liberate them from whatever this condition is that's possessing them.  In the end, I remember there's something of a celebration when the children do become liberated.  I remember only a few other scenes, like where one of the mutant boys becomes threatening toward one of the men when he realized that the man has taken photographs of... whatever is going on in this town with the children.  If I had to guess, I think the movie was from the 60's (possibly late 50's or early 70's).  Also, I've wondered if it could have been an episode of a TV series, but I really think it was a movie.  Can anyone help?
