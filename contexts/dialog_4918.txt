JANE: Hi. It's me.
TOM: Where are you?
JANE: I can't get away just yet. I'm at Aaron's.
TOM: Well, when?
JANE: I'm not sure. It seems like he had sort of a mishap on the news.
TOM: I know. I taped it.
JANE: It wasn't as bad as he think, was it? -- it wasn't unprecedented or anything?
TOM: Not if you count 'Singing in the Rain.' Do him a favor and don't treat it like a tragedy. You want me to talk to him?
