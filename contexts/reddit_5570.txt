How long should one be in a professional field before teaching as a professor?
I received my Master of Social Work in May 2018, and I've been very eager to teach Intro to Psychology as an adjunct professor at any one of the local universities or community colleges here. While reviewing some sample cover letters, I noticed that they all contain "I've been a Master/PhD of ______ for *X* years."

Since I only have just over a year in, am I too "green" to be teaching an introductory course? If so, how long should I wait? If not, how do I keep from saying in my cover letter that I've only been doing this just over a year?

Thank you in advance.

*Edit:* If it helps, I also have a bachelor's in psychology.
