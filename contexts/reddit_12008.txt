Unsure
Everything is trivial. I have no interest in anything no matter how hard I try. I am in a constant loop, everyday ghosting around with no meaning. I do not remember life before this. I have never had a mental connection with anyone, and cannot tell if this bothers me. I feel heavy. I feel light.
