HARRY: Who is she?
VALENTIN: Swann's wife.
DOROTHEA: I want you to help me help my husband. I know he's in some kind of trouble. And it's something to do with the man you saw murdered.
HARRY: Did your husband know Quaid?
DOROTHEA: Yes. They weren't close, but they saw each other once in a while. I think Philip believes all that stuff with the tarot cards.
HARRY: You don't?
DOROTHEA: I think we make our own futures.
HARRY: What's the connection?
DOROTHEA: I don't exactly know. Philip doesn't like to talk about the past.
HARRY: Why not?
DOROTHEA: He's a secretive man.
HARRY: And you don't ask questions?
DOROTHEA: We don't share our lives the way a lot of people do.
HARRY: Does that mean...?
DOROTHEA: We haven't slept in the same bed for years.
HARRY: But obviously you still care what happens to him.
DOROTHEA: We wouldn't be having this conversation if I didn't. Swann's one of the most remarkable men alive.
DOROTHEA: You don't believe me.
HARRY: He's an illusionist. It's not exactly brain surgery.
HARRY: Sorry. You asked.
DOROTHEA: No. You're right. He could have been something more. Maybe a lot more. But people get lost. Even good people. Too much fame. Too much money,
HARRY: Where do I sign?
DOROTHEA: Will you take the job, Mr. D'Amour?
HARRY: Harry.
DOROTHEA: Harry.
HARRY: I'm no bodyguard.
DOROTHEA: That's not what I'm asking for. I want somebody who can find out what Philip saw in those damn cards. And stop it from happening.
HARRY: When do you want me to start?
DOROTHEA: Come to the show with me. Tonight I want you to see him with an audience. They love him.
HARRY: Do you?
DOROTHEA: I didn't marry him for love, Mr. D'Amour. Tonight?
HARRY: Sure.
