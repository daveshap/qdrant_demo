MERRICK: Well, it's a lovely bedroom. What do you call that thing above the bed?
TREVES: That's a canopy, John.
MERRICK: Ohhh...
TREVES: How is your tea, John?
MERRICK: It's very good. I'm enjoying my visit with you very much. It's so very kind of you to have me as a guest in your home. I'm sorry I made a spectacle of myself.
TREVES: Not at all, John.
MERRICK: I love the way you've arranged your pictures on the mantlepiece. Is that the way it's done in most houses?
TREVES: Oh yes.
MERRICK: Who are they of?
TREVES: Oh, our relatives... the children.
MERRICK: The children! May I see?
TREVES: Of course.
MERRICK: The Children. Where are your children
TREVES: Oh, they're gone for the day... with friends.
MERRICK: Friends. Ah yes, friends! How nice.
ANNE: And here is one of Frederick's mother.
MERRICK: How lovely.
TREVES: Yes.
ANNE: And here are my mother and father.
MERRICK: They have noble faces.
ANNE: I've always thought that myself.
MERRICK: Oh, yes.
MERRICK: Would you... would you like to see my mother?
TREVES: Your mother?
MERRICK: Here.
ANNE: Oh... why Mr. Merrick she's beautiful.
MERRICK: She has the face of an angel... She was an angel. She was so kind... so kind to me. It's not her fault, for in the fourth month of her maternal condition she was knocked down by an elephant. I'm sure I must have been a great disappointment to her.
ANNE: Oh no, Mr. Merrick. No. No son as loving as you are could ever be a disappointment.
MERRICK: If only I could find her. If only she could see me now, here, with such lovely kind friends. You, Mrs. Treves, and you, Mr. Treves. Then maybe she would love me as I am. I've tried to hard to be good.
