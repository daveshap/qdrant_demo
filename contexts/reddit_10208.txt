The worst feeling in the world is when you don't want to be alive but you're too big of a pussy to do it because you feel obligated to stay for other people's well-being
I don't know why they'd even miss me. Even want me around. I destroy everything I touch, in a way. I'm not cut out for this "life" thing.
