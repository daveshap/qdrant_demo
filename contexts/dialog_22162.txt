LUKE: Your thoughts betray you, father. I feel the good in you...the conflict.
VADER: There is no conflict.
LUKE: You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe you'll destroy me now.
VADER: You underestimate the power of the dark side. If you will not fight, then you will meet your destiny.
