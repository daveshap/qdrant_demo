JUNO: Hey, what kind of swag did you score?
MARK: Yeah. Mall madness, huh?
VANESSA: Oh it's just some stuff I picked up. For, you know, the baby. Babies need a lot of things. I want everything to be just right.
JUNO: I thought people got all that stuff at baby showers. When my stepmom had my sister I remember she got about a million presents. They were all lame though, so I wasn't jealous.
MARK: I doubt anyone's throwing us a shower.
JUNO: Why?
VANESSA: Um, I think people are kind of unsure about the situation because it's not, you know, set in stone.
JUNO: What do you mean? You mean... Do you think I'm going to flake out on you?
VANESSA: No, no, I don't think that, Juno. It's just that, we went through a situation before where it didn't work out.
MARK: Cold feet.
JUNO: You should have gone to China. I heard they give away babies like free iPods. They shoot 'em out of those T-shirt guns at sports events.
VANESSA: Right. Well, Juno, your parents must be wondering where you are. You might want to head home.
JUNO: Naah. I'm already pregnant, so they figure nothing worse could happen to me. I gotta bounce anyway. It was nice seeing you guys again.
