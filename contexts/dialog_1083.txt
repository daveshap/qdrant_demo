WOODWARD: --this should take only a minute, Mr. Dahlberg, but we're doing a follow- up on the break-in-- --and I was kind of curious about your check.
DAHLBERG: ...check...?
WOODWARD: The twenty-five thousand dollar one. The one with your name on it. In Bernard Barker's Florida account. Bernard Barker, the Watergate burglar--
DAHLBERG: ...you're definitely doing a story...?
WOODWARD: Yes, sir.
DAHLBERG: I'm a proper citizen, I'm a decent man, I don't do anything that isn't decent or proper. I know I shouldn't tell you this...
DAHLBERG: That twenty-five thousand dollars is money I collected for Nixon in this year's campaign.
WOODWARD: I see. And how do you think it reached Miami?
DAHLBERG: I don't know; I really don't. The last time I saw it was when I was in Washington. I gave it to the Finance department of the Committee to Re- Elect the President. How it got to that burglar, your guess is as good as mine.
WOODWARD: That checks out with our finding, thank you, Mr. Dahlberg.
