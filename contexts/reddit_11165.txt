I could be done for sexual assault at 16 for a ridiculous reason.
I'm sitting here typing this in my principals (he's left to go do something) office both shocked and baffled by my current situation. So yesterday my schools rugby team defeated a rival schools team to knock them out of a cup, after which we left the ground we saw many rival supporters who we began jeering as we'd just won. Through our jeering this enraged them
and they began both spitting and bashing the windows of our bus furiously as we continued to anger them. In the heat of the moment I decided to moon a massive crowd of their supporters as the bus began to pull off. So today I'm called into my principals office and told that one of the students is filing for 'visual assault' and trauma. Sorry what? So because of a bit of banter after a match I could potentially go on Ireland's sexual offenders list at 16? I'm both in tears and shock and anger at this and I don't know how to handle this.
