ALAN: Should I run him through?
EDGAR: I've only got one question for you, and I want an honest answer. Have you taken any human victims yet?
MICHAEL: Of course not!
EDGAR: If you're telling the truth, it means we can save you.
SAM: He's telling the truth! Aren't you, Michael?
EDGAR: To free you, we must destroy the leader of the vampires.
MICHAEL: David.
EDGAR: I don't want names! Just lead me to him. Where's their nest?
MICHAEL: I'll take you there.
