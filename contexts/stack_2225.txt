How do I equip more moves? Currently, I can only equip two moves for the up/right and up/left stances, and one move each for the down/right and down/left stances, plus one extra move per stance on the other button.I've seen people with decks that have three moves per stance, though. How do I unlock bigger decks so that I can actually start customizing things?
