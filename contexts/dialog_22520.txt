SALLY: I told him I bought the lingerie, as a surprise. I don't think he suspects anything, but now you know, if he mentions it.
BOOTH: How the hell did he find it?
SALLY: He started digging through my closet, something he never does.
BOOTH: Great...
SALLY: It's OK, Booth, it's no big deal.
BOOTH: Let's hope so. SALLY If he asks me again, I'm gonna tell him I returned it all.
BOOTH: Dammit, I'm so sick of this.
SALLY: I know.
BOOTH: Every night I think about you sleeping with him, him slobbering all over you.
SALLY: He doesn't slobber, he just snores. And I told you we haven't...done anything in over a year.
BOOTH: It doesn't matter...he's next to you. You know, I always say to myself, you should have left him years ago. Why didn't you?
SALLY: I used to think he was something, once... I was eighteen, I didn't know any better, and he had something steady to offer.
