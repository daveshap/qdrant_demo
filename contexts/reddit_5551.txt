I'm new to the job market, why are company's asking for people to have so much experience, yet offering little compensation in terms of salary.
I saw a job posting for a Bookkeeper asking for 3 years of accounting experience and it only offered $16 an hour, no benefits. Do hiring managers think it's okay to have job postings with such outrageous askings?
