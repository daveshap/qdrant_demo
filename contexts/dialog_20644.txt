MRS. KELCHER: What happened to you?
PEGGY: I had a dream that Grandma died.
MRS. KELCHER: Well, she is getting on, but she's fine. I told her you weren't feeling well yesterday. She called to find out how you are.
PEGGY: She did? I love her so much, and I haven't seen her in such a long time. And Grandpa Barney. Is he all, right?
MRS. KELCHER: Yes, he's fine, too. You saw them at Easter.
PEGGY: I'm sorry, Mom. I'll call Grandma back and apologize.
MRS. KELCHER: That's a good girl... I hate to see you so upset. Tell me, sweetheart. Are you having problems with Charlie? You mentioned something this morning.
PEGGY: I'm confused about a lot of things right now. Charlie's only one of them.
MRS. KELCHER: Is Charlie pressuring you to do things you don't think you should be doing?
PEGGY: What do you mean?
MRS. KELCHER: Peggy, do you know what a penis is? Stay away from it.
MR. KELCHER: Hello, Charlie.
CHARLIE: Hello, sir. How are things at the hat store?
MR. KELCHER: Fine, thanks. Come on in. I want to talk to you.
