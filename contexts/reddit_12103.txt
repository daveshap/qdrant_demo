Success = Happiness?
I'm a simple man of simple means; I didn't graduate High School (Did get a G.E.D), I have an above minimum wage job, I rent my own place, I have the ability to buy things that I want, I've time enough for hobbies, and to top it all off I'm in great shape. 

I live a life that I should be both happy and content with, and yet I can't help but feel like a failure. I've no idea what I want to do with my life and I don't have a degree of any sort. Usually these things don't bother me but lately its seems that my Family, Friends, and potential girlfriends are all of the mind that I'm going nowhere fast. Apparently, one must have a degree to be happy and successful, and if anyone says otherwise they're fooling themselves.

I don't know what to do, I really don't want to go to college; I've never been the book smart type and I just don't see the wisdom in me paying to get tortured and then ending up in debt. But it's really affecting my social life, I've had more than a couple of people (friends and girlfriends) cutoff ties with me because they felt I wasn't ambitious enough. I just want to be happy, I want a modest house, a girl who understands me, and the ability to walk around with my held high, but apparently I need a degree for that.

Please forgive the Grammar, English always was my worst subject.
