KLUTE: I thought you ought to know, Arlyn Page is dead.
BREE: How?
KLUTE: The same as Jane McKenna.
BREE: Thanks for the jolly news. I thought maybe you'd left town by now. You kind of just disappeared. But you boys from Tuscarora have a habit of disappearing, don't you?
KLUTE: The next few weeks I would like to know where you are all the time.
BREE: Why?
KLUTE: Just let me know when you are going out and where --
BREE: What if i go out on tricks - you wanna come along? You could sit and read the National Geographic.
KLUTE: How can you do it to yourself?
BREE: I don't get you.
KLUTE: Ligourin: How could you do it?
BREE: I told you before, you wouldn't understand.
KLUTE: You're right, I don't understand. Explain it to me. You were scared. Arlyn Page, that scared you. Well it should; that's death. So what did you do, you ran straight for it, death. Ligourin kills women.
BREE: No.
KLUTE: No, no you're right, I'm sorry. He uses women; he lets them kill themselves. Is that how you want it?
BREE: Arlyn was a junkie; I'm not on junk!
KLUTE: No, you can find some other way. Explain it to me. Bree, show me any sense to --
BREE: You get the Christ out! You dumb stupid bastard, you don't know anything, you square, you get out! I don't have to show you anything; you get out!
