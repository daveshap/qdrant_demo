I got a 4.0 this semester in college!
 I don't ever like to post anywhere about my grades, but I got two A+s and two A's this semester in college, making it a 4.0 for the semester! 

I've been told by therapists before that it's at least 10 times harder for me to do any given assignment in school than most students as a result of my anxiety. I had some really hard tests and assignments this semester, a hell of a lot of panic and test-related nightmares, but I did it. 

I'm at a relatively difficult college and I even suffered through a horrible kidney stone that caused me to miss two weeks of class and cost me a trip to the emergency room. I also had chronic bronchitis that caused a couple doctor's visits as well. I genuinely don't have friends at college or groups I belong in. I have depression alongside this shit anxiety and I went through this all alone, away from any family or anyone that could help.

It may not be much, but I did it, and I made it through. And you guys can, too! 

Please never hesitate to get the support y'all need. If you can, reach out to get accomodations with your school and if you get sick, let teachers know! Get doctor's notes. Most professors are more understanding than you'd think. 

Y'all got this! I hope anyone who's semester just ended had a great one, and everyone else have a great holiday break and happy holidays in general.
