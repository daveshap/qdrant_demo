M.J.: The prowler in Hudson's apartment turns out to have a meeting with a suspect...
QUINN: You got a suspect...
QUINN: How'd you get in on the deal?
M.J.: I'm gonna drop charges on the break-and-enter at Hudson's...
QUINN: You have no authority to make a deal like that. That' s for the D.A...
M.J.: Or the F.B.I.?
QUINN: Saks. If he knew you did that! They're all asking me, 'what is she doing,' as it is.
M.J.: Give me Ruben back...
QUINN: Nikko?
