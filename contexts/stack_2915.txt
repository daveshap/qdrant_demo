How does the coating work when using an electron microscope? When a non-conductive sample is viewed with an electron microscope, it can happen that some electrons from the beam can be trapped (absorbed) by the sample so it acquires a charge. This is called \"charging\". To prevent charging, the non-conductive sample is covered with a thin coat of a conductive material.I've read that this prevents charging, but I don't understand how the coating works.If the sample holder is conductive, after depositing the coating the sample will be inside a conductive body (if the coating is in contact with the sample holder). But I'm stuck here because I can't see what this would imply on the charging effect: electrons could break through the coating and reach the non-conductive sample, charging it?Edit: The coating is usually a few nanometers thick. The electrons from the beam have typically energies of a few keV. In these conditions, I think the energy of those electrons is enough to penetrate some tenths or hundreds of nanometers (it also depends on the material but for metals the order of magnitude is similar), so they can reach the sample below the coating.
