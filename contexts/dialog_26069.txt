MACE: Yeah. Lenny. I have.
LENNY: It didn't stop you from loving them. Right? Or understanding them, or being able to forgive them...
MACE: I guess.
LENNY: And it didn't stop you from wanting to protect them. Did it?
MACE: No. It didn't.
LENNY: I worked Vice, Narcotics... Violent Crimes... and I saw every known depravity. I was lost, Mace. In outer darkness. Then I busted this strung-out little teeny-hooker. When I met Faith she was just another runaway giving twenty dollar blowjobs to buy crank. Another lost soul.
MACE: You never told me.
LENNY: But she was different. There was a light in her eyes... and she had this voice. It was scary, all that pain coming out of that little body. Like she could take all the hurt and rage of the entire world and lift it up to heaven in one voice. I helped her. And I promised her that I'd always be there... to protect her. See? It's not about what's in her head. It's what's in mine. I can't let go of the promise. It's... like... it's all I have left.
MACE: No, it's not.
