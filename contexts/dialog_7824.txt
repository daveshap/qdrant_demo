MS. HELLER: So the chest is still out there somewhere.
PRINCIPAL COLLINS: Yes. So as soon as Zimmer shows up, we'll get our check and blow this pop stand before anyone finds out anything.
MS. HELLER: This band sounds terrible.
PRINCIPAL COLLINS: I sold all the wind instruments. Hawaiian Air, business class. And you like that new fur coat?
MS. HELLER: Love it!
PRINCIPAL COLLINS: Well there's a reason why that mascot isn't a stallion anymore.
MS. HELLER: This is horse?
PRINCIPAL COLLINS: No... no it's not horse, you see I sold the horse.
