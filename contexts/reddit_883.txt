Anyone else sometimes get a huge burst of confidence, but then feel like absolute shit later?
Idk if this is the right place to post this, but I felt like I needed to get it off my chest. 

Every other week it seems, maybe for a day or two, I feel like I can do anything, like i'm on top of the world. However, after a day, everything comes crashing down and I feel like shit, almost like I didn't deserve that boost of confidence. It has just been a viscous cycle. 

UPDATE: I just went to the counseling center at my university, and they said I may have bipolar II. Thank you everyone for sharing, it really helps me feel less alone in this. I hope you all get the help you need as well
