BELLIARD: But, sire, Your Majesty would lay Paris open to being sacked. The enemy is outside the gates with more than 120,000 men. Besides this, I left the city under the terms of a treaty and I am forbidden to reenter Paris.
NAPOLEON: A treaty? Don't be ridiculous. What treaty is this? Who made it? Who has been giving orders?
BELLIARD: I don't know the details of the treaty, sire, Marshal Mortier sent me word of its having been agreed to, and he said that I was to take the army and make for Fontainebleau.
NAPOLEON: But who made this treaty?
BELLIARD: I believe it was arranged by Marshals Mortier and Marmont. I must explain to you that we have had no orders all day. Each marshal has been keeping his own position.
NAPOLEON: Who sent my wife and son out of Paris?
BELLIARD: I don't know, sire.
NAPOLEON: And where is Joseph?
BELLIARD: I don't know what has happened to Prince Joseph.
NAPOLEON: What cowardice! What treason! Joseph has ruined everything. How could they all lose their heads. They knew I was coming up fast. Victory was just within grasp. Come, come, turn your troops around, General Belliard.
