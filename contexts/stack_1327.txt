How to wire a 2 in 1 paddle switch I am changing a 2 in 1 switch that controls a light(top) and garbage disposal (bottom). They are controlled by different breakers. There was 3 wires in the old box. Black and red on top (different sides) and red on bottom, same side as black on top. I purchased a Legrand RCD33WCC6 paddle switch. When I wire red for light to top,black to common (Middle),and red for disposal on bottom. The light works with switch but disposal just comes on and stays on.  What is wrong?
