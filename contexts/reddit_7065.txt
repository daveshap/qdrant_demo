needing advice, what do you guys think of my plan?
Hello everyone, long story short i am an animator i was working full time before i lost my job, but I really want to start a small studio and create my own IP's, i am confiedent that if i dedicate a few years to working on my own stuff it will make me money in the long term. But currently i live in an apartment, would it be a good idea to get a part time job to pay my rent and food and just work loads on my own stuff?? its a basic plan, i just wanted to see what you lot would think. thank
