REBECCA: Do you think I did it?
DULANEY: I don't know. That's why I'm asking you.
REBECCA: You must have some feeling. Some immediate impression. A young, attractive woman, involved with an older man who leaves her everything in his will. And the things that went on in that house. Such wild sex. What kind of picture does that paint?
DULANEY: Not a very good one I'm afraid.
REBECCA: And that's exactly what the jury will see when they look at me. That's why I need a very good lawyer, Mr. Dulaney.
DULANEY: You're assuming the District Attorney is going to file charges.
REBECCA: He'll file. He's an ambitious man. Ambitious men build their careers on the bodies of others.
DULANEY: You still haven't answered my question.
