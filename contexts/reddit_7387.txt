Going to grad school after ten years, how do I increase my 'studying stamina'?
I'm starting a full-time master's degree (three year programme) in August. I graduated from undergrad more than ten years ago and I've been working since then. I'm wondering if y'all have any advice for how to improve my attention span/stamina for studying and comprehending difficult texts? Also, any W/L balance tips specifically related to missing the "real world" of the private sector would also be appreciated!
