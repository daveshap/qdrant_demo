JACK: I'm in your debt, Screwball.
SCREWBALL: Watch behind or I'll never collect on it!
GUMP: Well done, lad. Stout heart.
SCREWBALL: Wolf-slayer, worm-sticker... give a cheer for the champion!
OONA: Were I a mortal girl, Jack, methinks I'd be in love with you.
JACK: Then I'd kiss you without turning my garments inside-out and sewing bells all over.
OONA: No need for bells, Jack. I'll nay enchant ye.
