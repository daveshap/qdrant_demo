How bad is it to use my company PC to download tax software?
So I downloaded H+R block software from Amazon for $25 but failed to realize that I downloaded the PC version, I'm an idiot. My personal computer is a Mac, but my work laptop is a PC. Would my company penalize me for using the work laptop to file my taxes?
