Haha help
Yes, I am suicidal. Yes, I am "getting help". Posted on mobile.

 I don't believe in an afterlife or religion. I only believe in the void after death, where my conciousness ends. With that in mind, dying doesn't seem so bad to me, in fact it's very attractive, especially since I can't imagine myself doing anything productive with my life, or getting a good ending. I think that if I die now, I will stop all possibilities of all problems from affecting me and making me upset. I also believe that even if I was happy or successful, none of that would mean anything in the time frame of the life of the planet, much less the universe. With no knowledge of my personal life or my abilities or personality, I feel that nobody will be able to prove to me that I am unjustified in killing myself. I have had many people make the argument "your family and friends will be sad". My reasoning is this: in the void, my conciousness, and by extension, my conscience ceases to exist. This means I won't have to worry about any moral issues, including my method of suicide and whoever finds my body or whatever.
