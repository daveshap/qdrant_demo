Looking for Qualifications in any Field
Hey r/jobs community, 
I'm looking for some courses I could take to qualify me for careers. Which career? I dont care! 

I've got a path ahead of me through college, but I'm interested in branching out my knowledge to prepare me for whatever may cross my path. The more obscure and interesting, the better!

For example, I have a *beef quality assurance* certification through Texas A&M, and am workin ggv on my *Beekeeping 101* through PSU extension!

Any help you's could give me would be great. P.S. to mods: if this isnt the subreddit for this kind of post, could you direct me to one that is? Thanks!
