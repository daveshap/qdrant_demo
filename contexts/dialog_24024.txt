CHRISTY: Come on -- stay. Just a little. We can talk, I'll get a pizza. Pizza in bed, we'll have fun. And you still haven't told me what happened. What did she say?
VINCE: What did who say?
CHRISTY: Who? The other woman. Your wife.
VINCE: You are so damn sexy.
CHRISTY: Vince...
VINCE: How did I get so lucky? What is it now, five years we've been together? Who do I thank?
CHRISTY: Today was the deadline, Vince.
VINCE: I want us to be together. Like people. Honest, decent people. In the eyes of God. Babe, today... I went to confession.
CHRISTY: You did what?
VINCE: For the first time in I don't know how long. I wanted everything done right. Open and above board. I told Father Antonelli I was in love. I told him it was a special love, for all the ages.
CHRISTY: You said that? And what did he say? Did he say you could leave her? Did he say we'd be happy?
VINCE: He said that if I got a divorce I'd burn in Hell. For all eternity.
CHRISTY: What?
VINCE: You want me to go against a priest? Get excommunicated? You think I'm nuts?
CHRISTY: You bastard!
VINCE: We can still see each other. Just like always. It's a different kind of sin. Smaller.
CHRISTY: You pig!
VINCE: Babe, it's not me! I love you! It's God!
CHRISTY: You lying sleazeball! The best years of my life! What am I, garbage? Am I lint?
