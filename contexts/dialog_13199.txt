JOEY: ... but it is good. You know, over to the left, you can ...
TERRI: Who's that?
JOEY: I don't know his name ... I saw the whole story. A wounded bird was on his roof. I could hear its cries from here. He went straight to it. I couldn't've. I'd be frozen between pity and fear. But he wasn't. Its pain spoke directly to him. He picked it up. Nursed it. Fed it. And it got better. Everyday he'd watch the pigeon. Everyday the pigeon would watch him. I saw him learn. Learn that there was one more thing he had to do to make the rescue complete. And one day, just as afternoon became evening, he leaned over, opened the cage, and walked away. Didn't look back. But he heard the sound of its wings.
TERRI: And he still sits there?
JOEY: Every day.
TERRI: Maybe he thinks it'll come back.
JOEY: No. He knows it won't. It was his final act of love and part of him knows that and part of him doesn't yet.
