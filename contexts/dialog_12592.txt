ROB: Hello? Anybody there?
ROB: I'm all right, if that's what's upsetting you.
MOM: You know that's not what's upsetting me.
ROB: Well it fucking should be, shouldn't it?
MOM: I knew this would happen. What are you going to do Rob?
ROB: I'm going to drink this bottle of wine watch TV and go to bed. Then tomorrow I'll get up and go to work.
MOM: And after that?
ROB: Meet a nice girl and have children. I promise the next time we talk I'll have it all sorted out.
MOM: I knew this was going to happen.
ROB: Then what are you getting so upset about?
MOM: What did Laura say? Do you know why she left?
ROB: It's got nothing to do with marriage, if that's what you're getting at.
MOM: So you say. I'd like to hear her side of it.
ROB: Mom! For the last fucking time, I'm telling you Laura didn't want to get married! She is not that kind of girl! To use a phrase. That's not what happens now.
MOM: Well I don't know what happens now, apart from you meet someone, you move in, she goes. You meet someone, you move in, she goes.
