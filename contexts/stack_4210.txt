How can I legally reduce religion in my world? Religious rights are protected, and freedom to religion is secured, how can we reduce religion in a country without breaking religious rights laws.Here are some examples:Ban religious schools (perhaps indirectly by only allowing state-schools)Teach atheistic/spiritual/non-religious philosophies in state-schoolsBan organisations like halal certificationextra \"humanitarian\" tax on religious organisation profits, which is spent towards healthcare &amp; welfareFull financial transparency for any religious charitiesMake non-profits pay tax on profits (If you don't make a profit, you won't pay tax)banning public prayingbanning public religious preachingsHow else could you legally reduce religion? (without too aggressive laws)NotesThis is in a dictatorship, where the dictator wants to pass grey-area laws which aren't too aggressive, but can also slightly break some religious freedomThe dictator is worried about international attention, and if extreme anti-religious laws are made, then other nations will intervene. It can't be aggressive enough to trigger a casus belliThe world is like ours, same day and ageBonus Question: How would you prevent domestic religious teaching?
