How did you ‘make’ it?
I’m a first year grad student. I’ve had some brief research experience, but it’s mostly been very elementary with me doing a bulk of writing, making and running scripts, and -fleetingly- touching on formulation. All this was during my undergrad. 

Now that I’m taking grad courses (which are reeling in math) and I’m expected to do research, I always find myself thinking WOAH how did they come up with that / how did they even think of that when I read a paper. 

How do you do it? I just can’t find the bridge in the skill gap.
