Normalizing a digital surface model? I am trying to generate a normalized DSM by subtracting the original DSM (oDSM) from the DTM. To generate the DTM I had to first use a median filter on the oDSM (remove noise) and then use a morphological filter on the cleaned oDSM. For the morphological filter I had to convert the oDSM to an 8bit from float32. Now, I need to finally subtract the oDSM from the morphologically operated DSM. I need to know if subtracting two different data type rasters is a problem. If yes, how can I convert the 8 bit back to a GTIFF? I am working with QGIS and R.
