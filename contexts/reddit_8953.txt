Does Trump’s free speech executive order affect conservative Christian universities' long-standing policies of privileging Christian views?
On Thursday, US President Trump [signed](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/435183-trump-signs-executive-order-aimed-at-protecting-free-speech-on) an [executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-improving-free-inquiry-transparency-accountability-colleges-universities/) about free speech on college campuses. The order will [“withhold federal funding from public and private colleges and universities that do not protect free speech on campuses”](https://www.usnews.com/news/education-news/articles/2019-03-21/trump-to-sign-executive-order-protecting-campus-free-speech).

Many say that this is a move by conservatives to protect against the suppression of conservative views on college campuses—the existence of which is a separate question. However, one might consider how this executive order might actually protect against suppression of non-conservative, non-Christian, or non-heteronormative speech on conservative Christian colleges and universities—e.g., [Liberty University](http://www.liberty.edu/media/1312/hr_formsmanager_forms/Signoff%20for%20Doctrine,%20Ethics,%20&%20Harassment-full%20version%20(01-2015).pdf).

After all, some conservative Christian universities accept federal funds (, e.g., from tuition payments provided by federal [aid](https://www.christiancolleges.com/resources/financial-aid-for-christian-colleges/) or [grants](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/111109/grove-city-college-v-bell/).

However, many of these universities regulate not only speech, but also beliefs: They explicitly require faculty and staff to sign faith statements (see “Employment Practices” [here](https://www.cccu.org/institutions/) or an example of a statement [here](http://www.liberty.edu/aboutliberty/index.cfm?PID=6907)). This clearly and systematically requires certain speech and prevents speaking opportunities from atheists, non-Christian religions, and people with certain sexual identities/preferences, etc.—a clear violation of the executive order's attempt to "promote free and open debate on college and university campuses."

And many Christian universities do not hide this attempt to regulate speech. They celebrate the fact that they privilege conservative and/or Christian views over others in their curricula/classrooms/events with statements like, [“we integrate a Christian perspective into everything we do”](https://www.biola.edu/student-life). Indeed that might be what conservative Christian students (and/or their parents) find so appealing about the universities: they like the idea of a [“safe environment”](https://www.liberty.edu/residential/students/spiritual-growth/) where young impressionable minds can be protected from atheist/non-Christian/secular speech.

The White House claims that [“private schools \[need only\] follow their own policies, and the executive order will not impact student tuition aid programs”](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-colleges-idUSKCN1R22G0). However, in the past, private Christian universities that seek to maintain their own policies have had to either forgo accepting public funding from students or else seek a religious exemption—e.g., from Title IX standards: see [here](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2016/07/the-controversial-reason-some-religious-colleges-forgo-federal-funding/490253/) and [here](https://www.npr.org/2018/03/27/591140811/christian-colleges-are-tangled-in-their-own-lgbt-policies). 

So, on the one hand, if the executive order truly "ensure\[s\] institutions that receive Federal research or education grants promote free inquiry, **including through compliance with all applicable Federal laws, regulations, and policies**" (such as Title IX), then the executive order creates an opportunity to challenge private Christian colleges' and universities' practice of privileging certain speech and inhibiting other speech (emphasis added; see Section 3 of the executive order).

But, on the other hand, if the order allows private campuses to regulate speech of certain people on the basis of religion or sexuality after all, then the executive order creates an opportunity to challenge private Christian colleges eligibility for certain federal, state, and local funding—e.g., due to Title IX.

Either way, this executive order creates challenges for some private Christian universities in the US.
