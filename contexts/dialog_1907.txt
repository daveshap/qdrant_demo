WILLARD: Chef.
CHEF: Yes, sir --
WILLARD: Why they call you that?
CHEF: Call me what, sir?
WILLARD: Chef -- is that 'cause you like mangoes an' stuff?
CHEF: No, sir -- I'm a real chef, sir -- I'm a sauciere --
WILLARD: A sauciere --
CHEF: That's right, sir -- I come from New Orleans -- I was raised to be a sauciere.. a great sauciere. We specialize in sauces; my whole family. It's what we do. I was supposed to go to Paris and study at the Escoffier School; I was saving the money. They called me for my physical so I figured the Navy had better food.
WILLARD: What are you doing out here?
CHEF: Cook school -- that did it.
WILLARD: How?
CHEF: They lined us all up in front of a hundred yards of prime rib -- magnificent meat, beautifully marbled.. Then they started throwing it in these big cauldrons, all of it -- boiling. I looked in, an' it was turning gray. I couldn't stand it. I went into radio school.
