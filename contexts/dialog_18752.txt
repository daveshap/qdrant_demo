O'CONNELL: Where's your new friend?
BENI: What friend? You're my only friend.
O'CONNELL: Then you got no excuse for living. What the hell you doin, being buddies with this creep, Beni? What's in it for you?
BENI: It is better to be the right hand of the Devil,... than in his path. As long as I serve him, I am immune.
O'CONNELL: Immune from what?
BENI: You shall see.
O'CONNELL: What are you looking for? Lie, and I'll slit your throat.
BENI: The book! The black book they found at Hamunaptra! Imhotep wants it back. Said to me it would be worth it's weight in diamonds.
O'CONNELL: What does he want the book for?
BENI: Something about bringing his dead girly-friend back to life. He needs the book... And your sister.
JONATHAN: That looked rather painful.
O'CONNELL: Ya know, ever since I met you, my luck has been for crap.
JONATHAN: Yes, I know, I do that to people.
O'CONNELL: Damn-it! That's two down and only two to go.
JONATHAN: And then he'll be coming after Evy.
