DR. BENNETT: Glad to see you're not trying to have a heartfelt talk. It's one of my greatest annoyances, when people talk to those who can't hear them.
WILL: My father and I have an advantage. We never talk.
WILL: How long have you known my father?
DR. BENNETT: Thirty years. Maybe more.
WILL: How would you describe him?
DR. BENNETT: Five-eleven. One-eighty. Regulated hypertension. How would his son describe him?
DR. BENNETT: Did your father ever tell you about the day you were born?
WILL: A thousand times. He caught an uncatchable fish.
DR. BENNETT: Not that one. The real story. Did he ever tell you that?
WILL: No.
DR. BENNETT: Your mother came in about three in the afternoon. Her neighbor drove her, on account of your father was on business in Wichita. You were born a week early, but there were no complications. It was a perfect delivery. Now, your father was sorry to miss it, but it wasn't the custom for the men to be in the room for deliveries then, so I can't see as it would have been much different had he been there. And that's the real story of how you were born.
