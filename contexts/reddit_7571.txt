Received a rejection from a big journal with barely any constructive feedback.
I received a rejection from a pretty big journal in my field, and I was very disappointed by the lack of feedback given. They offered few nitty gritty points of feedback but no real reasons to reject.  The editor mentioned that they rejected due to “many concerns” by reviewers but there was hardly any other feedback than usual comments one would expect from a revise and resubmit. It was 2:1 reject to revise and resubmit. Has anyone received this kind of feedback before? Thoughts? I feel bummed because I don’t have many take always from the peer reviews and it was with them was a solid 4 months.
