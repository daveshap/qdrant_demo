ERIC: ...I won't let a killer walk!
: 157 CONTINUED:
MEYERLING: Alleged killer.
ERIC: What does this matter to you?
MEYERLING: You can't see past your lousy little assignment, sniffing around the pipeline. The few voters there are in this district look up to Corbett, and I'm not about to alienate them.
ERIC: I should release Corbett because you want some votes?
MEYERLING: This miserable wilderness is a state of the union. Policy's made here the same way as in the civilized world: at the ballot box. That's the beauty of it -- these icebox cowboys are living a century too late. Get them on your side, it's like buying Manhattan for beads. With a handful of votes you control the greatest frontier since white men stumbled onto the New World.
ERIC: Some day these people'll wake up, and you'll be the first one they'll run out of here.
