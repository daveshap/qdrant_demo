I hung myself 17 years ago
I was 20 years old. I wrapped a heavy insulated wire around a tree branch, stood on an old metal folding chair and wrapped the stiff wire around my neck a bunch of times, I said to myself "well, this is it" and stepped off the chair. I was instantly unconscious. I woke up in a hospital thinking it was the next day but two days had passed and I was tied to the bed with sores around my ankles where I was restrained. They told me my body was wrenching and writhing violently and the paramedics thought I was on pcp. One of my roommates found me hanging and had saved my life. Thanks, I guess. I was sent to a mental hospital with a very sore throat. Turns out I don't like being locked up. I told them what they needed to hear and they let me out in 72 hours. I've tried to appreciate this second chance for 17 years. I'm not lonely. I'm my happiest and most at peace when no other person can see or hear me. There is no hope, nothing helps. I could see the future back then as I can now and I want/ed no part of it. I've tried. I've tried so fucking hard. I've had my last birthday.
