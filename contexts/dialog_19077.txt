NAPOLEON: The important thing is to find the right lawyer. One who will not protract the thing indefinitely, in the courts.
JOSEPH: You know I am only too happy to be of help to you, but surely this isn't the ideal moment to involve yourself in such matters.
NAPOLEON: I know of no better time.
JOSEPH: You can't be serious. It would not be good to become another husband out of a Moliere farce.
NAPOLEON: The comedy of my marriage is sufficiently well known already.
JOSEPH: You must not act impetuously.
NAPOLEON: It is time to clarify the situation. Everything is over between us.
JOSEPH: But you can do the same thing in six months. The next few weeks may be the most important ones in your life.
NAPOLEON: My mind is made up. She will not set foot in my house again. I think if I saw her again, I might be tempted to strangle her.
JOSEPH: Are you sure that you are not still in love with her?
NAPOLEON: Are you trying to insult me?
JOSEPH: Of course not, but such violence of feeling makes me wonder.
NAPOLEON: Well, you shall see.
JOSEPH: When is she supposed to return?
NAPOLEON: I have no idea. Her maid said she left two days ago, to meet me -- I can imagine where she is. But when she finally does come home, she will find her things in the street and my door locked.
JOSEPH: She will probably appear with a dozen excuses and you will forgive her anyway.
NAPOLEON: My dear Joseph, the only thing that is clear is that my wife is a slut -- and while a man may want a slut for his mistress, he does not want her for his wife.
NAPOLEON: Were you in love with him?
JOSEPHINE: I thought I was. I was confused.
NAPOLEON: And now?
JOSEPHINE: Now, I know that I shall die if you leave me.
NAPOLEON: Do you expect me to believe that?
JOSEPHINE: Yes.
JOSEPHINE: And you, are you in love with any one else?
NAPOLEON: No.
JOSEPHINE: But you have had mistresses while you were away.
NAPOLEON: Of course.
JOSEPHINE: Were you in love with any of them?
NAPOLEON: No.
JOSEPHINE: Were they pretty?
NAPOLEON: Yes.
JOSEPHINE: Were any of them prettier than I am?
NAPOLEON: One had better legs.
JOSEPHINE: Were any of them married?
NAPOLEON: Yes. They were the easiest. I made love to one of them within ten minutes of our first meeting.
JOSEPHINE: She must have been in love with you.
NAPOLEON: Not in the least. After all, what is adultery -- only a brief transaction on a couch, requiring a few minutes of privacy.
JOSEPHINE: Promise me you will never leave me.
NAPOLEON: I cannot promise you that.
JOSEPHINE: Promise me.
NAPOLEON: I will never forgive you.
JOSEPHINE: I don't care, but promise you will never leave me.
NAPOLEON: I don't understand you.
JOSEPHINE: Promise.
NAPOLEON: Promises mean nothing.
JOSEPHINE: Perhaps -- but tell me you promise, anyway.
NAPOLEON: All right -- I promise.
JOSEPHINE: You are my old friend.
