WELLES: It's an awful title, of course, but I can't think of anything better. Someone came up with A SEA OF UPTURNED FACES -- which has a nice, grand ring to it -- and I thought of JOHN CITIZEN, USA but that strikes me as a bit Warner Brothers. Or, God forbid, Capraesque. I suppose AMERICAN will do for now but--
SCHAEFER: CITIZEN KANE
WELLES: Pardon?
SCHAEFER: CITIZEN KANE There's your title.
WELLES: A Z" and a "K" in the title. That would draw the eye. For the poster. I like that THE PRISONER OF ZENDA had a "Z" and a "P" and that worked--"
SCHAEFER: Now look, Orson, let's not get ahead of ourselves. The budget projections on this--
WELLES: I know, I know! But what more can you expect of me?! I have pared this story down to the marrow to save money but to cut more would be to--!
SCHAEFER: Listen, get off your horse with me. You know I've stuck by you since the beginning of time it seems like, while the stockholders in New York were ready to cut and run and everyone else in Hollywood was set to toss me in a rubber room. But your contract stipulates a max budget of 500 thousand. This one's gonna come in at 750 thousand. What do we do about that?
SCHAEFER: Now don't have a fit -- but I want you to think again about doing WAR OF THE WORLDS-
WELLES: Jesus
SCHAEFER: Do WAR OF THE WORLDS as a feature and everyone's happy. You make some money and New York's happy and you have a track record and then we'll move on to KANE.
WELLES: Please don't ask me to do this.
SCHAEFER: It's the safe bet, Orson. There's nothing wrong with that.
