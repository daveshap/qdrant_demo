RHEYA: What do I have to do to stop it?
KELVIN: I want you here.
RHEYA: You're lying.
KELVIN: You exist here. I keep telling you.
RHEYA: That's impossible. I'm not Rheya.
KELVIN: Who are you, then?
RHEYA: I... I am Rheya. But I am not the woman you loved ten years ago.
KELVIN: Yes, you are --
RHEYA: Did you hear what Gibarian said? I'm not a human being. I'm an instrument. I came from your memory and your imagination and I will torture you no matter what. Even if I remain passive. That's when I drank the... I was going mad. It felt like there was no body underneath my skin. There was something else. An illusion. But I could feel my heart beating, and I remembered you tested my blood. Is it like yours?
KELVIN: Yes. I told you. It was exactly like mine.
RHEYA: But then I would be dead now.
KELVIN: Is that really what you want?
RHEYA: I want to stop taking those pills.
KELVIN: I wish you wouldn't.
RHEYA: They do something to me. It's hard to think straight.
KELVIN: I think they help.
RHEYA: I have consciousness, but I am not mortal. Don't you see why I'm going crazy?
KELVIN: You have to remember that I love you, that's all that matters --
RHEYA: I can't --
KELVIN: It put you here. I'll admit it, it acted like a God and put you here, put you into my consciousness. I was asleep, and it put you into my dream. I saw your mouth. And there you were. Whether you've been sent here to make me happy or punish me, it doesn't matter. The decision we make now is all that matters. Stay with me.
RHEYA: Am I really her?
KELVIN: I don't know anymore. All I see is you.
