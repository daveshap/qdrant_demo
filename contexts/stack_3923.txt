How multi layer neural network classify data without extracting features? In CNN we have convolution layer and pooling layer for feature extraction. How the features are extracted in Fully connected neural network? Secondly CNN has more expressive power and and number of learn able parameters are also less in this case. I want to know that if CNN are so perfect then why we use fully connected neural networks?
