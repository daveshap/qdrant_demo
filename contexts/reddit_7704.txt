I am a Multimedia Designer - What Master's Degree Should I Get?
Before anyone goes off on not needing an advanced degree in my field, I agree. A demo reel and solid portfolio is all I really need to excel in media production. However, an opportunity may present itself that a degree would be partially/fully paid for, so I am simply exploring my options.

I have seen the following degrees as options:

1. Graphic Design (meh)
2. Instructional Design
3. Film & Media Studies
4. Communication

Does anyone have any suggestions about the best type of degree to pursue? I work in the private sector, usually supporting corporate initiatives ranging from HR trainings to social media content... from agency film work to online video course studies, etc.
