What happens when an electric charge crosses the event horizon? Let's say a charged particle is falling into a black hole. What happens immediately after the particle crosses the horizon? It seems to me that one of these two situations will take place.The charge is instantaneously distributed on the surface of the horizon. It looks like this scenario breaks the local conservation of electric charge. Not only this, but charge density moving instantly from one end of the horizon to another would generate an infinite electromagnetic field.The charge is not instantaneously distributed on the surface of the horizon. But this would violate the no-hair theorem, because the black hole would have a non-uniform charge distribution.
