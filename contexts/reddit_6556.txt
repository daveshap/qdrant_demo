How do you apply for the airlines? Iâ€™m in Pittsburgh , Pa
I had a good friend I lost touch with give me the information how to apply as a flight attendant with Delta . I understand that might be ambitious for a would be first timer working on the airlines . 

Could someone please provide a link to the airline you work for what you like about it ? maybe perks you receive ? This is something I have always been interested in doing . 

Thank you all!
