Hey Reddit Users, Help a Heart-broken Brother out will ya?
Yeah like the title says i went through a pretty messy break up with a girlfriend of 7 years that i am trying to salvage what i can of our relationship.
So in the mean time if it doesnt work out can i get some suggestions on what to do? (Btw i am an 18 year old loser whos a skinny nerd with some emotional baggage)
