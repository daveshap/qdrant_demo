MITCHELL: The lie?
NIXON: You remember, John, in '48 -- no one believed Alger Hiss was a communist. Except me. They loved Hiss just like they loved this Ellsberg character. East Coast, Ivy League. He was their kind. I was dirt to them. Nothing.
MITCHELL: And Dick beat the shit out of them.
NIXON: But I wouldn't have if Hiss hadn't lied about knowing Chambers. The documents were old and out of date, like these Pentagon Papers. The key thing we proved was that Hiss was a liar. Then people bought it that he was a spy. It's the lie that gets you.
MITCHELL: Hiss was protecting his wife. I've always believed that.
NIXON: When they know you've got something to protect, that's when they fuck you!
