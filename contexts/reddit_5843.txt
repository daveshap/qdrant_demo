Are multiple Associates degrees worth it? Or just redundant?
I received an AAB in Management last July from a CC and then transferred to a university - this August I'll be done with my BS in Business Admin. 

I'm taking 3 (8-week) classes (the max) at the university to get done ASAP, and since I had only a few classes to go to get an AAB in Accounting for free at the CC, a couple of classes with them simultaneously. I work for a municipality and free unlimited online community college classes are a benefit of the union that I am a part of. However, it's only at one school with limited options. I had to pay out of pocket to finish my Bachelors, but what are you going to do. Also, before anyone gets too ahead of themselves and tells me to focus on my Bachelors's, I have a 4.0 with both schools - no issue with performance. I also plan on starting my MBA by the end of this year.

My question is: since the community college classes are completely free to me, is it worth it to put it a little bit of extra effort to attain the second AAB, but this time in Accounting? Also, with my current AAB in Management, I am only 2 classes short from another AAB in HR Management. Is that worth pursuing? I could be done with both additional AABs by October. 

My reasoning behind this is that I want to appeal to employers as much as possible and show that I'm not a one-trick pony, but in fact, pretty well rounded (with the degrees to prove it?). While I have 12 years of financial & hr business admin experience, I want to move up upon completion of my BS and ultimately be able to pay for the MBA as I go, instead of crippling myself with student loans. Also, I'm 32 years old and the plan is to continuously advance in my career.
