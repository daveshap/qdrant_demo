Are the former Attorney General's allegations against PM Trudeau criminal?
Yesterday, former Attorney General of Canada Jody Wilson-Raybould [testified](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/wilson-raybould-testifies-justice-committee-1.5035219) that Prime Minister Trudeau and his staff had repeatedly pressured her to overturn the decision from the director of the Public Prosecution Service to prosecute the large Quebec-based engineering company SNC-Lavalin.

Ms. Wilson-Raybould was eventually moved to a different role in Cabinet (Veterans Affairs), and subsequently resigned from Cabinet earlier this month.

Following her testimony, leader of the opposition and Conservative party leader Andrew Scheer [called for Trudeau to resign and for the RCMP to launch a criminal probe.](https://globalnews.ca/news/5007650/andrew-scheer-justin-trudeau-snc-lavalin-resign/)

NDP leader Jagmeet Singh called for a public inquiry, but not for the immediate resignation of PM Trudeau.

PM Trudeau said ["I completely disagree with the characterization of the former attorney general about these events."](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/wilson-raybould-testimony-liberals-1.5036494)

I have two principal questions:

1. If true, do the allegations made by Ms. Wilson-Raybould against the Prime Minister constitute a crime, as implied by Mr. Scheer's call for a police investigation?

2. What forms of public inquiry, as suggested by Mr. Singh, would be available? Would a [royal commission](https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/royal-commissions) be historically or structurally appropriate for a discrete issue like this?
