ROBINSON: Dwayne Robinson. Well, what have you learned? What do they want?
POWELL: The terrorists? Don't know, Sir. We haven't heard a peep from them.
ROBINSON: Then who the hell have you been talking too?
POWELL: We don't exactly know, Sir. He won't give us him name. He appears to be the man who called in the report...he's killed one of the terrorists for sure and claims he capped two others.

ROBINSON: -- recognizing phony ID's? Christ, Powell, he could be a fucking bartender for all we know!
