PORTER: Baron Kurtz.
MARTINS: Must be some mistake.
MARTINS: Yes.
BARON: I was a friend of Harry Lime.
MARTINS: I would very much like to meet you, Baron. Come around.
BARON: Austrians aren't allowed in your hotel. Couldn't we meet at the Mozart cafe?
MARTINS: Where?
BARON: Just around the corner.
MARTINS: How will I know you?
BARON: I'll carry a copy of one of your books. Harry gave it to me.
