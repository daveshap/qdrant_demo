SANDY: Well, you can...
WENDY: Hey Sandy, what were you blowing up out there? Your mom was pretty p.o.'d.
SANDY: All my model planes.
WENDY: The ones you built?
SANDY: They were old. And they couldn't fly anyhow. I'm going to get a radio-controlled airplane at Christmas, and then I'll stuff it full of m-80s and then fly it into Mrs. Burgess's English class and blow it up.
WENDY: I have to go to the bathroom.
SANDY: Yeah.
