KOESSLER: He said it was a clue?
SALINAS: Maybe something to do with Zorro.
KOESSLER: Don't say that. Don't even think that. The next thing we'll be hearing about Zorro Killer" in the media -- this hasn't gotten out
SALINAS: Just hospital talk. Nothing that connects to Speck.
KOESSLER: This could all be a coincidence, but, you know something, I don't believe in coincidences. That's why I came back. Do you think the UNSUB -- we're not going to mention the word Zorro -- met Harold Speck online?
MACKELWAY: Yes I do.
KULOK: It explains a lot.
SALINAS: But why attack an Agent?
MACKELWAY: He wants us to know he's out there, what he's doing. It's not enough just to kill somebody like Speck, he wants us to know he did it.
KOESSLER: Agent Mackelway, you're going to get your wish. You're going back to Washington. I want you back in Computer Crimes. Fire up those chat rooms.
MACKELWAY: This time, sir, if I may be so bold, would it be possible to set up my equipment outside CIIAC, perhaps in military housing at Quantico? I didn't get along very well with the other members of the Division. We thought differently.
KOESSLER: You didn't like anyone looking over your shoulder -- why was that? What were you doing?
MACKELWAY: If my Reporting Agent could be someone outside Computer Crimes, perhaps Agent Kulok?
KOESSLER: I'll take it into consideration.
MACKELWAY: What I do requires confidentiality.
KOESSLER: I always meant to ask, what is it that makes you so special? Why is it you have this special rapport with multiple killers? Why you?
MACKELWAY: They like my stories. They like the way I think. They're into fantasy. I turn them on.
