BERLIN: That's a very stupid question, Ross.
ROSS: I'm asking it.
BERLIN: How the hell do I know <u>who</u>? Some jerk-off. Some peeping-tom prick.
ROSS: Ease off, John ..
BERLIN: <u>I'm sick of this toy town shit</u>.
ROSS: Everything you say sounds reason- able. But there's also a reason- able explanation for the opposite.
BERLIN: Don't give me that! <u>Not another</u> <u>word</u>! When you had the Fat Lady in there, and I asked you if she was lying, you looked me right in the eyes and said <u>yes</u>. So as far as I was concerned, <u>she's ly-</u> <u>ing</u>. And if the King of fucking England had walked in & told me different, I wouldn't have bel- ieved him - because <u>you</u> told me ..
ROSS: I dunno what I can do to help you?
BERLIN: I dunno what I'd do with your help. I've gotta take her out of there ..
ROSS: What about Citrine?
BERLIN: Screw Citrine. He can fire me.
BERLIN: Has he got your aunt's address?
HELENA: I don't think so .. He said the police had been calling .. want- ed to ask me some more questions ..
BERLIN: Who? Probably Angelo .. I'll take care of it .. Don't worry, we- 're gonna find this guy, and everything'll be O.K. .. O.K.?
BERLIN: You're looking worried again, Helena?
HELENA: No I'm not.
BERLIN: You're looking more worried now than when you decided to stop worrying"?"
HELENA: Alright, I'm worried about Christmas. I wish I hadn't told him I'd be back ..
