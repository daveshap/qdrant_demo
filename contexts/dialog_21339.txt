UTAH: Yeah. I just want to sit out here for a minute.
TYLER: Look at you.
UTAH: What?
TYLER: Well, usually you have this sort of intense scowl of concentration, like you're doing this for a school project or something... I don't know, like something's driving you. See, it's gone. If I didn't know better I'd say you looked almost happy.
UTAH: I... I don't know. I can't describe what I'm feeling.
TYLER: You don't have to.
