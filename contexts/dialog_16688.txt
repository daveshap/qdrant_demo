SIDRA: So what are these Spanish guys like?
MONICA: I wouldn't know.
SIDRA: What? You've been over here seven months and you ain't tapped anything?
MONICA: Just not my type, I guess.
SIDRA: Shoot, Italian boys love them some black women. They can't get enough of me.
MONICA: You ever think about going back?
SIDRA: Sometimes. But what's the alternative, not playing? You remember big Toni? She quit last year, now she's working at some bookstore. I mean, look at us. They treat us like we're Hollywood stars over here. We just played in the championship game. It doesn't get much sweeter than this.
