JOHNNY: Drink up, Charley. We're ahead of you.
CHARLEY: I'm not thirsty.
JOHNNY: After what we been hearing about your brother, I thought your throat'd be kind of dry.
CHARLEY: So they're walking along and smiling. That doesn't mean he's going to talk. There's no evidence until he gives public testimony.
JOHNNY: Thanks for the legal advice, Charley. That's what we always kept you around for. Now how do we keep him from giving this testimony? Isn't that the— er— as you put it— main order of business?
CHARLEY: He was always a good kid. You know that.
