Should I take this job?
I've worked in student services for 6 years. I got my MA in higher ed in 2017. My husband is the primary "breadwinner", salary-wise.

I had to leave a good job last year due to medical issues that required my full time attention. After getting healthy, I took a part time temp job to earn some money while I waited for the next job cycle to begin.

I've been applying to jobs the last few months, had some interviews, etc. Had an offer from one school but it wasn't a good culture fit for me despite my desperation, so I agonized over the decision but eventually turned it down.

I was just offered another job but the salary is really low and I'd be relocating 4 hours away. The salary is less than what I was making 3 years and one master's degree ago.

I really like the job and people. Location is okay, but far from our family and friends. The salary is an issue. I'm not sure if I can justify moving my family for that little money. 

I guess I'm left wondering if I should take the job because I'm desperate, wait too the next cycle, or what. I'm also a finalist for another position that is in our ideal location with good pay, but I won't get an answer from them until next week.

Do you guys and gals have any advice? Thank you.
