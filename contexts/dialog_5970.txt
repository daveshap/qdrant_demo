BUSTER: What are you going to tell the little ones?
LARCH: I'll tell them Fuzzy was adopted.
BUSTER: Why would the little ones believe that *anyone* would adopt him?
LARCH: They'll believe it because they want to believe it.
BUSTER: Shouldn't we tell Homer?
LARCH: If Homer wanted to know what was happening here, he could pick up a telephone and call us.
