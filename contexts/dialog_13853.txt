WILL: She was nice." Wow. That makes me all soft inside. Ever occur to you she didn't love you back?"
RANDY: Huh?
WILL: You heard me that time.
RANDY: She loved me. She wanted to see me every night.
WILL: But she was seeing someone else on the side.
RANDY: I don't know what you're fucking talking about.
WILL: Friday night, at the party - what'd you fight about?
RANDY: Stuff.
WILL: What kind of stuff?
RANDY: Just stuff. I don't fucking remember.
WILL: The other guy?
RANDY: I told you I don't remember.
WILL: After that she left the party to go to him.
RANDY: How should I know?...
WILL: Ran like hell to go to him...
RANDY: Fuck you, man! - I'm sick of all your fucking cop questions...
