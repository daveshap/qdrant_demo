MAUDE: Here we are, Harold. Oat straw tea and ginger pie.
HAROLD: Certainly a new experience for me.
MAUDE: Wonderful! Try something new each day. After all, we're given life to find it out. It doesn't last forever.
HAROLD: You look as if you could.
MAUDE: Me. Ha! Did I tell you I'll be eighty on Saturday?
HAROLD: You don't look eighty.
MAUDE: That's the influence of the right food, the right exercise, and the right breathing. Greet the dawn with the Breath of Fire! Of course, there's no doubt the body is giving out. I'm well into autumn. I'll have to be giving it all up after Saturday. Sweeten the tea with honey, Harold. It's delicious.
HAROLD: That's a nice teapot.
MAUDE: Sterling silver. It was my dear mother-in-law's, part of a dinner set of fifty pieces. It's one of the few things that survived. Oh, but I do rattle on so. Tell me about yourself, Harold. What do you do when you aren't visiting funerals?
