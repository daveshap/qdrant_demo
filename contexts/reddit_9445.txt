Do not underestimate the advantage of consolidating your debt. The difference between an average credit card rate and a consolidation loan is roughly 40% of the total debt every 4 years, 96% after 8 years, and 274% after 12. This can dramatically improve your ability to pay off debt.
For those of you not aware, nearly all financial institutions offer consolidation loans to get people out of credit card debt.
For those of you with high rates, consolidation loans can have massive effects on your ability to pay down debt.

Comparing the average 16% card to a 7.24% consolidation loan will save roughly $4000 for every $10,000 every 48 months. This means a $150 payment pays off twice the amount of debt instead of half of the payment being wasted on paying crazy credit card interest.

The effect of reducing your interest rates cannot be expressed enough. Interest builds on itself and grows exponentially.

Consolidation loans are also far better for your credit score because they count as a loans and not as credit card debt, which will dramatically improve your credit score, as the two kinds of debt are scored completely differently.

Nearly all financial institutions have these kinds of consolidation loans, so I'm not endorsing any particular company. It's your choice. 

I hope this helps!
