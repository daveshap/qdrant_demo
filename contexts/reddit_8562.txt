How realistic is Erogdans strategy in Syria and does it have sympathy or support from any other countries?
Most of the media talks about the issue of incursion into Syria from the lens of US foreign policy. I'm trying to understand the motivations behind Turkeys strategy and what they hope to achieve. 

With /u/nosecohn 's help I found this article.

>>His solution, recently laid out in a speech at the UN General Assembly, is to carve out a large buffer zone along Syria’s border with Turkey. The area would be 300 miles long and 20 miles deep, under Turkish control, and off-limits to Kurdish forces. According to Erdogan, this “safe zone” would host two million to three million refugees, thus ridding Ankara of a major domestic headache. It would boast 200,000 homes, along with hospitals, football pitches, mosques, and schools, Turkish-built but financed internationally—a setup that would provide much-needed revenue for Turkey’s struggling construction sector at a time of economic downturn.

It sounds like there are three outcomes trying to be achieved.
1/ Relocation of refugees who are becoming a difficult problem for domestic politics
2/ Undermine the possibility of creation of a Kurdish state
3/ Provide economic stimulus to the domestic construction industry through construction projects funded by the international community (nobody has agreed to that but I guess they will try to bargain for it)

How realistic is this plan and does it have sympathy or support from any other countries?
