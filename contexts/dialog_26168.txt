JEFF: Guy should cut down on his caffeine intake.
BUFF: Needs some pizza in his diet.
TIM: I don't think I like that guy's attitude at all. Hey, you know what? Take off the blades. I mean it. I'm gonna break your fucking legs. Take 'em off.
BUFF: You're fascist, man. Neofascist.
TIM: Buff, sit. You know what I mean though? Somebody ought to crack that guy with a baseball bat.
JEFF: Yeah, well, he's from a Third World country. He doesn't have it easy.
TIM: What? What the fuck do you know about the third world? You been there? No? No, well, I have. Fuckers live like sardines in a can over there, you know. Everything stinks. It's true, there's no, you know, law, no order. No nothing. The assholes come over here, they think it's gonna be the same.
JEFF: Hey, he's a human being you can give him that much.
TIM: Actually, the only thing I gotta give that guy is a one-way ticket back to Greaseball-land.
JEFF: Yeah, well, that pizza could feed a family of four in Turkey or India or wherever the fuck he comes from.
BUFF: Oh yeah? Oh, how'd you ship it over there, man? Federal Express? Hm? By the time it got there it'd be way cold and coagulated. Total waste. Cheese be stuck to the cardboard.
JEFF: Buff, that slice is the difference between life and death for some half-dead Bangladeshi.
BUFF: Yo, your gettin' me all upset here.
JEFF: You should get upset. Everyone should get upset. When, when Hitler was greasing the Jews, people were saying, Don't get me upset. Your bumming me out." My duty as a human being is to be pissed off. Jesus Christ
TIM: If it's all so fucking futile, what the fuck are you so fucking upset about, fuckhead?
JEFF: Because I'm alienated.
