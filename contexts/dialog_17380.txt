MAYOR: Yes, Spencer. Who? The Governor? Well, what about me? it's my building he's jumping off of! And I'm up for re-election, too!
SECRETARY: Shh!
MAYOR: What are you doing? Get Connell at the Bulletin ! Why, he's liable to go right past my window, What was that?!
SECRETARY: What?
MAYOR: Out the window! Something just flew by!
SECRETARY: I didn't see anything.
MAYOR: Well, don't stand there, you idiot. Go and look. Open the window. Oh, why did he have to pick on my building?
MAYOR: Is there a crowd in the street?
SECRETARY: No, sir.
MAYOR: Then he may be caught on a ledge! Look again!
SECRETARY: I think it must have been a sea- gull.
MAYOR: A sea-gull? What's a sea-gull doing around the city hall? That's a bad omen, isn't it?
SECRETARY: Oh, n-no, sir. The sea-gull is a lovely bird.
MAYOR: I-it's all right, Mrs. Brewster. It was just a sea-gull. Er. nothing's happened yet! No, I'm watching. Don't worry. Ju-just leave it all to me!
