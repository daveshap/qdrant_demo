INDIANA: Hey, Willie -- I think you better get out now.
WILLIE: Stark naked? You wish... If you're trying to seduce me, Dr. Jones, this is a very primitive approach.
INDIANA: Me seduce you? Honey, you're the one who took your clothes off. I just came over to remind you that you never know what else might be in the water.
WILLIE: Somehow I feel safer in here.
WILLIE: Indy! Help me!
INDIANA: Don't worry, I'm coming in! What is it?
WILLIE: A snake!
INDIANA: A what...?
WILLIE: A SNAKE!!
WILLIE: Hurry, help me out of here! What're you waiting for?!
INDIANA: Uh, listen -- Willie -- I got a better idea.
WILLIE: What?!
INDIANA: First of all -- don't panic!
