Can one factor be used multiple times in multi factor authentication? Is it mandatory in MFA that the factors should be (1) something you have  + (2) something you know + (3) something you are, or it is okay to use any single of two factors multiple times (e.g. password + fingerprint + retina scan)? It seems there are one more factor to consider as \"Something you do\" which includes your handwriting pattern, typing speed etc [Ref: Computer Security: Art &amp; Science by Mat Bishop].
