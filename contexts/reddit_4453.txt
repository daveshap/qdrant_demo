How to be "you" when you are not sure who "you" is
&#x200B;

I am a 20 yr old in college. I used to think I knew who I was.

Example: I used to think I found beauty in math. Then I delved into more and more difficult math courses, and I eventually convinced myself I was too stupid to do it and could not appreciate its beauty any more.

I used to think I knew a lot of other stuff about myself too. It was comforting. Events took those certainties away from me, and now I realize myself as a dynamic being, and my identity can't really be defined by anything nor am I really comfortable defining it, since it is always subject to change, always subject to something I hadn't seen before that I can see now, or at least realize I can't see. Why pigeonhole myself to believing the same thign all my life?

To be in this constant state of questioning and openness to change is in a way terrifying. I feel as if there is no stability in who I am as a person. People say just to be "you" but the thing is I'm not sure who I am. Because to me it all depends. Who I am right now could be different from who I am tomorrow. And moreover I am not *confident* in the person who I am now because I know how little I know, and how ill informed most of my decisions likely are. This is a huge source of depression for me.

On the flip side I feel like people who think they know who they are are ignorant. I believe we are all constantly being changed and affected by the experiences in life and people's personalities change depending on context. And if people try to act the "same" thorugh it all it just means they are shutting themselves off, preventing themselves from being sculpted by life.

But is that a bad thing? Should you completely open yourself up to life, and let it sculpt you? What if your life has been traumatic? Should you not let life sculpt you at all, perhaps retain idealist values and cling tightly to them, maintaining the integrity of the sculpture, making it stand the test of time? Somewhere in the middle maybe?

**The verdict is I am struggling to develop a healthy relationship with myself.** In one way, I don't want to associate myself with any form of identity because its limiting my growth as a person. On the other hand, I feel like some form of identity is absolutely necessary to a healthy being with a good relationship with oneself. People find other people who have a strong sense of self attractive and fun to be around. While I might've used to be this person, I just can't put so much faith into my self anymore, its so unfinished, so incomplete, I feel pathetic.

Perhaps to find myself I need to revert to my emotional urges and impulses, but I don't want to submit to those really, because they are not much healthier than not having a self. Perhaps I need to make my identity some sort of wanderer, and gain my certainty from the act of wandering and navigating through the eternal grey area that is life.

**I DONT KNOW, and I DONT KNOW HOW ANYONE CAN KNOW.**

Someone please give me your thoughts, and thanks.
