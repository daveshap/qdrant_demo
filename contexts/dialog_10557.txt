CHILI: I checked the bag at the airport, when I came.
BONES: Yeah? Which terminal?
CHILI: Sovereign.
BONES: You found Leo, didn't you? Took the poor asshole's money and put it in a locker, ready to go. Why haven't you left?
CHILI: I like it here.
BONES: Look, there's no reason you and I shouldn't get along. Forget all the bullshit from before -– I don't even remember how it started. You took a swing at me over some fuckin' thing, whatever it was -– forget it. You owe me some money, right? Forget that too. But, you don't say a fuckin' word about this to anybody. It's strictly between you and me, right?
CHILI: Whatever you want, Ray.
