SUSAN: And what I love about molecular science is the way it revolutionizes how we have to think. It unifies the entire world on a single level. Everything is completely connected. Sometimes I can really feel it, everything around us, just a small part of a whole. It's really wonderful.
O'BRIEN: Yeah, we'll see.
SUSAN: We'll see? What does that mean?
O'BRIEN: We'll see how wonderful it is after you spend the next twenty years making Agent Orange.
SUSAN: God, Daniel, I'm not going to make Agent Orange.
O'BRIEN: You think the chemists that invented Agent Orange twenty years ago were in school saying, 'Boy, I really got some good ideas for a highly toxic incendiary defoliant.' You think Oppenheimer was dreaming about mushroom clouds before the war?
SUSAN: We've had this conversation already, Daniel.
O'BRIEN: All I'm saying is that the companies that have money for the kind of research you're interested in, have money because that's what they're interested in! Money!
SUSAN: I'm sorry I brought the whole thing up! If you're gonna flip your wig --
O'BRIEN: I can't help it, Suze. It's this place. You know how I get in these stores. They freak me out. All these tiny boxes, little cans filled with eight syllable God knows what.
