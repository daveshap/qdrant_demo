REGGIE: I hope it turns out you're a Whitefoot, Alex -- I could be very happy hanging around the tepee.
DYLE: Reggie -- listen to me --
REGGIE: Oh-oh -- here it comes. The fatherly talk. You forget I'm already a widow.
DYLE: So was Juliet -- at fifteen.
REGGIE: I'm not fifteen.
DYLE: Well, there's your trouble right there -- you're too old for me.
REGGIE: Why can't you be serious?
DYLE: There, you said it.
REGGIE: Said what?
DYLE: Serious. When a man gets to be my age that's the last word he ever wants to hear. I don't want to be serious -- and I especially don't want you to be.
REGGIE: Okay -- I'll tell you what -- we'll just sit around all day long being frivolous -- how about that?
DYLE: Now please, Reggie -- cut it out.
REGGIE: Okay.
DYLE: What are you doing?
REGGIE: Cutting it out.
DYLE: Who told you to do that?
REGGIE: You did.
DYLE: But I'm not through complaining yet.
REGGIE: Oh.
DYLE: Now please, Reggie -- cut it out.
REGGIE: I think I love you, Alex --
DYLE: The phone's ringing --
REGGIE: Whoever it is won't give up -- and neither will I.
