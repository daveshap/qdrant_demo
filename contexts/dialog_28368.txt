FLOYD: Doyle, can I see you a minute?
LONNEGAN: I'm busy, Floyd.
FLOYD: It's important. We had a little trouble in Chicago today. One of our runners got hit for 12 grand.
LONNEGAN: Which one?
FLOYD: Mottola.
LONNEGAN: You sure he didn't just pocket it?
FLOYD: No, we checked his story with a tipster. He was cleaned by two grifters on 47th.
LONNEGAN: They workin' for anybody?
FLOYD: I don't know. Could be. We're runnin' that down now.
LONNEGAN: All right, mark Mottola up a little and put him on a bus. Nothin' fancy, just enough to keep him from coming back. Get some local people to take care of the other two. We gotta discourage this kinda thing.
