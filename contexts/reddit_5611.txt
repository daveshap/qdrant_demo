Reality check for dream job please
Boyfriend is pretty high up in management for a basketball academy for school age kids. He deals with the money, scheduling, policies and procedures, just about everything there. He also coaches high school teams from time to time. Highest level was a summer league that toured in all the large MidWest cities playing games. The kids love him as a coach. I know I'm biased but he's damn good at coaching.

An assistant men's basketball coach job for a small college opened up (3,000 students). He won't apply because he said he has zero chance. I'm trying to push him to at least try, he would be fucking amazing at it. Is he right that there's very little chance at getting hired and I should let it go?
