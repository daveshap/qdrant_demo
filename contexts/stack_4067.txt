Is a medical evaluation required for Australia's eVisitor (subclass 651) visa? I just applied for a 651 for my son to make his annual visit here from the UK, which is usually processed in a day or two. This time, however, they've requested that he get a medical exam and chest x-ray? Why?We do this every year; the only difference now is that he's 18 years old and that I'm now an Australian citizen.Has anyone else ever been requested to do this? Is it possible that it's a mistake? Surely they can't expect every holiday visitor to spend time and a large amount of money prior to a visit to Australia.
