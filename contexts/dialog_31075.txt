LULA: I'm fine, mama. I just wanted to tell you not to worry.
MARIETTA: Why, how could I not worry? Not knowin' what's happenin' to you or where you are? Are you with that boy?
LULA: If you mean Sailor, mama, yes I am.
MARIETTA: Are you comin' back here soon, Lula? I need you here.
LULA: Need me for what, mama? I'm perfectly fine, and safe, too.
MARIETTA: You in a dance hall or somethin'? I can hear music behind you.
LULA: Just a place.
MARIETTA: Really, Lula, this ain't right!
LULA: Right?! Mama, was it right for you to sic Johnnie Farragut on us? How could you do that?
MARIETTA: Did you run into Johnnie in New Orleans? Lula, are you in New Orleans?
LULA: No, mama, I'm in Mexico, and we're about to get on an airplane to Argentina!
MARIETTA: Argentina! Lula, you're outta your mind. Now you just tell me where you are and I'll come for you. I won't say nothin' to the police about Sailor, I promise. He can do what he wants, I don't care.
LULA: Mama, I'm hangin' up this phone now.
MARIETTA: No, baby, don't! Can I send you somethin'? You runnin' low on money? I'll wire you some money if you tell me where you are.
LULA: I ain't that dumb, mama. Sailor and I been on a crime spree? Knockin' off convenience stores all across the south? Ain't you read about it?
MARIETTA: Lula? I love you, baby. I just want you to be all right.
LULA: I am all right, mama. That's why I called, to let you know. I gotta go.
MARIETTA: Call me again soon? I'll be waitin' by the phone.
LULA: Don't be crazy, mama. Take care of yourself.
SAILOR: I was just wastin' time, peanut, till you come back.
LULA: It's me who's wastin' time, Sailor, bein' with you.
SAILOR: Honey, I'm sorry. It wasn't nothin'. Come on and get up and we'll take off.
LULA: Leave me be for a minute? Mama gets all insane and then I see you practicin' your individuality and personal freedom with some oil-town tramp. How you figure I'm gonna feel?
SAILOR: Told you not to call your mama.
