SICK BOY: This had better be good.
TOMMY: It will be. It'll make a change for three miserable junkies who don't know what they want to do with themselves since they stopped doing smack.
SICK BOY: If I'm giving up a whole day and the price of a ticket, I'm just saying it had better be good. There's plenty of other things I could be doing.
TOMMY: Such as?
SICK BOY: Such as sitting in a darkened room, watching videos, drinking, smoking dope and wanking. Does that answer your question?
TOMMY: We go for a walk.
SPUD: What?
TOMMY: A walk.
SPUD: But where?
TOMMY: There.
SICK BOY: Are you serious?
TOMMY: Well, what are you waiting for?
SPUD: I don't know, Tommy. I don't know if it's... normal.
TOMMY: It's the great outdoors.
SICK BOY: It's really nice, Tommy. Can we go home now?
TOMMY: It's fresh air.
SICK BOY: Look, Tommy, we know you're getting a hard time off Lizzy, but there's no need to take it out on us.
TOMMY: Doesn't it make you proud to be Scottish?
