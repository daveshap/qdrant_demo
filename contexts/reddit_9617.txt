Do I want my master's degree? I have concerns about timing and being overqualified or unemployed.
I'm looking for some insight.

I interviewed for a spot in several graduate programs and was not initially matched with an assistantship. I took this as a sign that it's not the right time, and I should pursue other opportunities.  My area of interest is advising, and I haven't found any bachelor-level jobs in my area, but there are still functional areas where I'd be content building experience that don't require a master's degree. Plus working full-time allows me to pay down my student loans.

But... this week I was contacted by folks with open assistantships in my program of interest (and one of the positions is in advising). I know that if I get an offer, I will have to make a decision very quickly, and I want to have my answer prepared in the event that they do make an offer.

I've made my list of pros and cons, and it really comes down to the fact that I am hesitant about getting the degree and being either unemployed or overqualified. I follow the SA Pros group on Facebook and have been a little intimidated by the number of people who are unemployed or who have left the field. Like I mentioned before, I also have some other areas of interest that don't necessarily require a master's degree (e.g. admissions), and I wonder if I should maybe pursue a job in one of those fields before committing to the master's degree. I know that I will need to get the master's degree at some point to get the jobs I'm most interested in, but I don't know if I want to do it now or later.

Does anyone have advice for making this decision? Thank you in advance. :)
