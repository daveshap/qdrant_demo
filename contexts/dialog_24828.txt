WAYNE: Evening.
ANNA: It can't be.
WAYNE: Excuse me?
ANNA: You're Warren Wayne.
WAYNE: Uh, yes I am. And you are?
ANNA: Anna Koros. She sensually extends her hand, Warren shakes it -
WAYNE: Koros, as in...Koros? Dimitri Koros?
ANNA: My grandfather. My God, I can't tell you what a fan I am of yours! You were magnificent in Deadly Gamble.
WAYNE: Oh, thank you.
ANNA: Magnificent, magnificent.
WAYNE: Well I appreciate that.
ANNA: So, what brings you out here? Pleasure cruise?
WAYNE: Well a little business too. In my upcoming project Star Trackers I play a ship's captain, and I really wanted to get a feel for the outer space experience. I feel it will add more credibility to my performance.
ANNA: Of course, of course...
WAYNE: So...
ANNA: Well I guess we're neighbors for this trip.
WAYNE: Well, so we are. Sure is beautiful, huh?
ANNA: It certainly is.
WAYNE: Well, it was nice meeting you. Enjoy the rest of the trip.
ANNA: I'm sure I will.
