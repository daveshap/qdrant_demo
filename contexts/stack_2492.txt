pgShapeLoader cannot be opened because of a problem I installed the OpenGeo Suite 4.8 on MacOS 10.13. I can open pgadmin3 from the package, as well as PostGIS. When opening the pgShapeLoader I get the following error:  pgShapeLoader cannot be opened because of a problem.<br>Check with the developer to make sure pgShapeLoader works with this version of macOS. You may need to reinstall the application. Be sure to install any available updates for the application and macOS.  <blockquote>  Process:               pgShapeLoader-bin [8517] Path:<br>  /Applications/PostGIS  Utilities/pgShapeLoader.app/Contents/MacOS/pgShapeLoader Identifier:<br>  org.opengeo.pgShapeLoader Version:               ???
