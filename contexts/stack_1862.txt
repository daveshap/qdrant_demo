Is 'I was climbing down the road' correct? My friend Thomas asked me to come in his home with my brother Solomon. So me and my brother were on the way to his house. Thomas called me (on the phone) while I was on my way over and asked me \"where did you reach?\" Then I replied, \"I'm climbing down the road\". As soon as I said that sentence, my brother started laughing and pointed me out that it is not a correct sentence. Actually at that moment I was very tired and that road was also very steep (hard slope). And I was having difficulty walking down that road. So I was trying to express my tiredness to my friend. My question is whether it is correct to use 'climbing down' instead of 'walking down' in a sentence?
