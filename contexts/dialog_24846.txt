BARNES: Weren't you down in the dining room?
MAC: I was there. Officer Taylor accessed my CPU directly to open the airlock doors. They are not functioning properly.
BARNES: Oh he did, did he?
MAC: Yes he did. Yes he did. Barnes looks at the monitor - Taylor and the others are still in the dining room -
BARNES: You didn't do anything to the monitors, did you Mac?
MAC: I did nothing to the monitors.
BARNES: And what are they doing now, Mac?
MAC: They are awaiting further information.
BARNES: Were you going to give it to them?
MAC: I am here to provide service to... to all our guests. There is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction. It is my duty...to report this.
BARNES: Well you did the right thing Mac.
