MORGANA: You are truly magnificent!
MERLIN: Flattery! Do you think I am ignorant of your stupid little games? Preying on you weakness of others. That's your power, a petty evil. Mine is great. Great plans. Impossible dreams. Laughable endings...
MORGANA: Merlin, the powers of Summoning, the true Name of the charms of Doing and Undoing. Show me!
MERLIN: I won't. You would misuse such power. I have paid enough for you, and I will have you.
