CROSS' VOICE: Hello.
GITTES: Have you got your checkbook handy, Mr. Cross? I've got the girl.
CROSS' VOICE: You've got her? Where?
GITTES: Do you remember the figures we discussed?
CROSS' VOICE: Of course I do. Where are you?
GITTES: At your daughter's house. How soon can you get here?
CROSS' VOICE: Two hours... tell me, will Evelyn be there as well?
GITTES: Either that or she'll be in jail.
CROSS' VOICE: What are you talking about?
GITTES: Just bring your checkbook.
