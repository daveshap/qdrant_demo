ALICE: Here you are. Where were you this morning? Rick's looking all over for you.
KRISTEN: Have you seen Joey and Kincaid! God, I can't find them. I can't find them anywhere.
ALICE: I'm sure they're around.
KRISTEN: Yeah, I'm not so sure.
ALICE: I love to dream, I just hate ones about my dad.
KRISTEN: You could do worse.
ALICE: My mom taught me when I was little. Did you ever hear of the dream master?
KRISTEN: Sounds like a game show host to me.
ALICE: No really, it's a fable. The 'guardian of good' dreams. It was like my teddy bear when I was growing up.
KRISTEN: Great, you wouldn't happen to know his phone number?
ALICE: I daydream. you have to dream about some place fun. Remember you're in control.
KRISTEN: How'd you learn so much about dreams?
ALICE: When they're all you have, you kinda become an expert.
