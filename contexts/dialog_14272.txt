BEAUMONT: Fuck that shit, man. I ain't shootin' anybody.
ORDELL: What the fuck I tell you. You don't hafta shoot nobody. Just hold the gun. They'll get the idea.
BEAUMONT: I ain't gittin' in that trunk.
ORDELL: We're only goin' to Koreatown. You'll be in there -- ten minutes.
BEAUMONT: Uh-uh. I ain't riding in that trunk no minutes. Why don't I just ride with you?
ORDELL: You can't ride with me. The surprise effect is ninety percent of it.
BEAUMONT: Well, I'm sorry, man, but I ain't gittin' in that trunk.
ORDELL: I can't believe you do me this way.
BEAUMONT: I ain't doin' you no way. I just ain't climbin' in that trunk. I got a problem with small places.
ORDELL: Well, my ass has got a problem spending ten thousand dollars of my own goddam money to get ungrateful, peanuthead niggas outta jail, but I do it --
BEAUMONT: Look, man, I know I owe you --
ORDELL: Well, if you owe me, git your ass in the trunk.
BEAUMONT: I wanna help you, but I don't wanna be locked in the trunk of no car.
ORDELL: You think I wanted to spend ten thousand dollars on your ass?
ORDELL: Answer the question, nigga. Do you think I wanted to spend the thousand dollars on your ass? Yes or no?
BEAUMONT: Course you didn't.
ORDELL: But the only way to help you was to do that, so I did it. Okay, how 'bout this? After we're through fuckin' with these Koreans, I take you to Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles. My treat.
