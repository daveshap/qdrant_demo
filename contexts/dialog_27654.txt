MELANIE: What did you say?
MITCH: I was merely drawing a parallel, Miss Daniels.
MELANIE: But how... how do you know my name?
MITCH: A little birdie told me. Good day, Miss Daniels. Madam.
MELANIE: Hey, wait a minute!
MELANIE: I don't know you.
MITCH: Ahhh, but I know you.
MELANIE: How?
MITCH: We met in court.
MELANIE: We never met in court or anyplace else.
MITCH: That's true. I'll rephrase it. I saw you in court.
MELANIE: When?
MITCH: Do you remember one of your practical jokes that resulted in the smashing of a plate glass window?
MELANIE: I didn't break that window!
MITCH: No, but your little prank did. The judge should have put you behind bars!
MELANIE: What are you? A policeman?
MITCH: I simply believe in the law, Miss Daniels, and I'm not too keen on practical jokers.
MELANIE: What do you call your lovebird story if not a practical...
MITCH: Ahhh, but I really do want those birds.
MELANIE: You knew I didn't work here. You deliberately...
MITCH: Right. I recognized you when I came in. I thought you might like to know what it felt like to be on the other end of a gag. What do you think of that, Miss Daniels?
MELANIE: I think you're a louse.
MITCH: I am. Good day. Madam.
MELANIE: And I'm glad you didn't get your lovebirds!
MITCH: I'll find something else. See you in court some day.
MELANIE: That... that... who was that?
MRS. MACGRUDER: I have no idea.
MELANIE: Have you got a pencil?
MRS. MACGRUDER: What? Oh, yes, certainly.
MRS. MACGRUDER: They said the myna bird would be here later this afternoon. If you'd care to come back...
MELANIE: No, you'd better send him. May I use your phone?
MRS. MACGRUDER: Yes, certainly.
MELANIE: Do you have any lovebirds?
MRS. MACGRUDER: No, not in the shop. But I can order them for you.
MELANIE: How soon?
MRS. MACGRUDER: Well... well, how soon would you want them?
MELANIE: Immediately. Is this the Daily News? Melanie Daniels. Would you get me the city desk, please?
MRS. MACGRUDER: I might be able to have them by tomorrow morning. Would that be all right?
MELANIE: That would be just fine. Hello, Charlie, this is Melanie. I want you to do a favor for me. No, this is a small one. Pressure you? Why, Charlie darling, would I try to pressure you? Will you call the Department of Motor Vehicles for me and find out who owns this license plate? DKQ dash one seven six. Yes, a California plate. No, I'll stop up there in a little while. Is daddy in his office? Oh. No, no, I don't want to break in on a meeting. Just tell him I'll see him later. Thank you, Charlie.
