Are the Fremen cannibals? I saw a debate recently on Facebook but can't find it now, I've searched in loads of FB forums looking for it since, someone (convincingly) spelled out step by step why the Fremen ate the meat of their dead after they had reclaimed the water. Allegedly there are hints in the first 3 Dune books about this issue.Does anyone know about this?
