Made a significant step towards happiness.
Deleted Instagram and Snapchat off my phone. Yeah. This may sound stupid as fuck but Instagram and Snapchat were holding me back significantly. I felt like those apps were making my condition go crazy almost everyday. Glad I made this step towards a better life.
