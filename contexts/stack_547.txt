How to burn .iso file to external hard-drive I need to use an external hard drive, the same as a Live-USB,  I used to download an ISO file and burn/copy it's content to a USB using a software like unetbootin, but unetbootin does not detect a my external hard drive (a file manger do).If you know any way that I can try/install a distro without using a USB/CD I will be really happy to use your help
