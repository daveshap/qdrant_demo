Useful things to learn for those in the sciences?
So I'm using all the free time I have from covid-19 to learn some new skills to improve my resume and make me a better candidate. I'm unsure if my old work will survive after lockdown eases up or ends (I'm in the SF Bay Area) so that's a factor too. 

Some background info: I graduated in 2019 with a BS in chemistry and am looking for lab tech positions. My old job was at R&D for a cosmetics company and I didn't use as much of my degree as I would've liked while I was there. I still have all my notes I took for my chem classes so I should be able to study up on that when/if I get rusty.

Right now, I'm learning some more complex stuff with Excel and I know Python is a good thing to learn too. Is there anything else that would make me a stronger candidate for jobs involving the sciences, more specifically chemistry?
