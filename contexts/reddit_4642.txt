Anyone else just bloody exhausted?
I am exhausted. I have spent the last 2 years clawing my way out of the pit of depression and it always feels like I just fall back in. It feels unfair and it hits me harder and harder every time. I go to therapy, try medication, change my diet, monitor my sleep,  download fucking apps, change therapists look for the best people in the field and I am still here feeling like shit and unable to shake thoughts about ending it all. I am over it. I feel broken and hopeless. I don't feel like I'll ever be better.   
Does anyone ever \*actually\* recover????
