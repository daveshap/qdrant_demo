Is an International Business Degree any good for a career?
I was planning on doing Business Administration at UCR with a finance concentration, but I was recently accepted into UCSD. They only offer IB or Economics, however economics is difficult to switch to. 

I am thinking about doing IB with a minor in finance UCSD. Will that still give me similar opportunities as BA? I’ll be doing my masters in business either way after a few years working. My goal was to become a financial advisor or analyst of some sort. 

There are other factors that are somewhat unrelated to the sub so I won’t include them.
