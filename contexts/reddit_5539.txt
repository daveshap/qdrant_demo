Books to read to be a better employee?
Was just thinking if/when I am at a new workplace I kind of want to start strong and the right way.  Learnt a lot from my past job but want to be better.  I was looking on Amazon and lists online and there are tons of books related to how to be a better manager or entrepreneur.  Maybe there is some overlap there but I'm not leading anyone, haha I'm just trying to improve my communication skills, etc.  Thanks!!
