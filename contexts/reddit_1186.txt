does anyone get anxious around the noise of yelling?
i always have a fear of loud yelling even if it’s not directly at me, i don’t have a fear of loud noises at all but if it’s yelling it’s different. it sends me into panic and overthinking. i’ve been though traumatic things growing up so maybe that’s it,or does anyone else feel this way too with their anxiety.
