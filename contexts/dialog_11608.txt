COLE: Well. If Mary Beth vouches for you, and if she told you the story already...
MYRA: So here we are!
COLE: Mister Hebbing, we are talking about breaking the law here, I want to be sure you understand that. No one gets hurt, but the law does get broken.
HEBBING: Well, that's what the law's for, isn't it?
COLE: And I don't just mean the SEC. We could have the FBI breathing down our necks.
HEBBING: I certainly hope not.
COLE: Loose talk is the one thing I worry about.
HEBBING: I can keep my mouth shut, Mister Fellowes.
