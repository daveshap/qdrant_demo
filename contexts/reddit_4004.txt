I fucking hate what apps like tinder have done to the world of dating
\[23/m\] words cannot express how deep my hatred is for tinder (or any swipe dating apps), and online dating in general. it has significantly damaged my mental health, and there’s no end in sight.

1. it puts average looking men at a severe disadvantage. I’ve spent so much time and effort into tinder and bumble, getting the perfect pictures, sending a ton of messages, swiping right on everyone, etc. fucking nothing. it’s wrecked my self esteem, and it makes me resent those who effortlessly match with dozens of people
2. if you’re and awkward texter, you’re completely fucked. there’s an immense amount of pressure to be charming, funny, etc etc when you start texting your match, and if you’re not, you’ll never get anywhere.
3. it’s allowed women to not have to even set foot out of their homes to find tons of men to date. that’s taken away the impetus for many women to actually go out and meet men in real life.

I moved to a new city about 6 months ago. I’ve wanted a relationship desperately since I’ve been here, and I’ve tried it all. I’ve spent months swiping on tinder and bumble. total failure. I’ve tried approaching girls whenever I’m out and about, got lots of numbers, but in the end that was a total failure too.

I also spend a substantial amount of time going to MeetUp events to meet girls. I try to put myself out there and meet as many people as possible, in the hopes that one day I will come across a nice girl who I can pursue. as it turns out, the gender ratio at the vast majority of these events is about 75 men 25 women, and of those women, maybe half are my age.

&#x200B;

to me, it seems that the age of online dating has made the dating world as a whole more isolating and emotionally crushing for average looking men. I’m so fucking frustrated sexually and emotionally I have a hard time thinking straight sometimes. I don’t have money, so those singles meetups in bars are out of reach for me. anything that costs money is out of the question.

&#x200B;

and yet here I am, back on tinder and bumble. why? because apparently that’s one of the only fucking ways to meet girls. I hate it, but I feel like I don’t have a choice.

how do the other average looking men in this sub deal with this?
