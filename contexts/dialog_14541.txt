MIKE: I don't need you. Andy's here.
SEAN: You always go with Andy.
MIKE: How was dive class?
ANDY: Same as always -- glub-glub, bubble-bubble, stroke-stroke. There sure is some weird shit on the bottom of the ocean.
BROOKE: Shells and lobsters and stuff?
ANDY: Mostly old garbage. Today we found a '48 Hudson.
SEAN: Do I have to play with the little kids?
MIKE: Yeah. Go on, beat it.
