WILL: Thanks.
FARRELL: I wish I'd had the chance to get to know him better. Take him fishing or something.
WILL: He would have liked that.
FARRELL: We just gotta catch the bastard, right?
WILL: That's why I'm here. I need to know exactly what you saw yesterday, Farrell.
FARRELL: What I saw?
WILL: Anything. It's important.
