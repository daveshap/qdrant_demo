WOODLY: Hello? Oh--hello, Mother.
HAROLD: Hello, Mother.
WOODLY: ...Who?... Did she say how far apart the pains were?... When was that?... Oh dear.
HAROLD: Oh dear.
WOODLY: Call her back--tell her to head for the hospital. Tell the hospital to expect her. I'll leave right now.
WOODLY: Look--I'm sorry--I have to go.
HAROLD: We'll miss you so.
WOODLY: Look--this isn't my apartment, and there isn't anybody else here. Mrs. Ryan won't be home for a while.
HAROLD: Oh, oh, oh--I thought it was your apartment. You seemed at home here.
WOODLY: I'm a neighbor. I have the apartment across the hall. I have to go to the hospital now. An emergency.
WOODLY: I mean--I can't leave you here. You'll have to go. I'll tell Mrs. Ryan you were here. You can come back later.
HAROLD: Ahh--then she's still alive.
WOODLY: She's fine. Please--
HAROLD: And still Mrs. Harold Ryan?
WOODLY: Will you please go? An emergency!
HAROLD: She still has just the one child-- the boy?
WOODLY: Yes! Yes! The boy! One boy!
HAROLD: And what, exactly, is your relationship to Mrs. Ryan?
WOODLY: Neighbor! Doctor! I live across the hall.
HAROLD: And you come into Mrs. Ryan's apartment as often as you please, looking into various health matters?
WOODLY: Yes! Please! You've got to get out right now!
HAROLD: Just her neighbor and doctor? That's all?
WOODLY: And her fiancé!
HAROLD: And her fiancé! How nice. I hope you'll be very happy--or is that what one says to the woman?
WOODLY: I've got to run!
HAROLD: You wish the woman good luck, and you tell the man how fortunate he is. That's how it goes.
WOODLY: I've literally got to run!
HAROLD: I won't try to keep up with you. I'm not as fast on my feet as I once was.
HAROLD: Miss me, baby?
LOOSELEAF: I dunno, boy.
HAROLD: Hm?
LOOSELEAF: It's a bitch.
HAROLD: A bitch.
LOOSELEAF: Didn't recognize you.
HAROLD: We've never met.
LOOSELEAF: I wonder who'll recognize us first? They'll wet their pants.
HAROLD: I hope the men do. I would rather the women didn't.
LOOSELEAF: I'm gonna wet my pants.
HAROLD: Home, sweet home.
LOOSELEAF: One thing, anyway--at least Penelope didn't throw out all your crap. I bet Alice threw out all my crap after I'd been gone a week.
HAROLD: We'll see.
HAROLD: It appears that we're going to have to wait awhile for any more action here, Colonel. Why don't you run on home while the evening's young.
LOOSELEAF: Home. Jesus. I'm like this. Home!
HAROLD: Home is important to a man.
LOOSELEAF: You know what gets me?
HAROLD: No.
LOOSELEAF: How all the magazines show tits today.
HAROLD: Um.
LOOSELEAF: Used to be against the law, didn't it?
HAROLD: I suppose.
LOOSELEAF: Must have changed that law.
HAROLD: Home.
LOOSELEAF: You know what gets me?
LOOSELEAF: You know what gets me?
HAROLD: Oh, shit.
LOOSELEAF: How everybody says fuck" and "shit" all the time. I used to be scared shitless I'd say "fuck" or "shit" in public
HAROLD: Looseleaf--will you get the hell home?
LOOSELEAF: At least we found the diamonds.
HAROLD: At least!
LOOSELEAF: I'd really feel stupid if we didn't bring anything back home.
HAROLD: It's enough that you've brought yourself home!
LOOSELEAF: I wish you'd tell Alice that. And that Goddamn Mrs. Wheeler.
HAROLD: Tell them yourself!
LOOSELEAF: You don't know my mother-in-law, boy.
HAROLD: After eight years in the jungle with you, I know Mrs. Wheeler better than I know anybody in the universe!
LOOSELEAF: I didn't tell you everything.
HAROLD: The time we were in a tree for fourteen days, you certainly tried to tell me everything about Mrs. Wheeler.
LOOSELEAF: I didn't even scratch the surface. You're lucky, boy. You come home, and nobody's here. When I go home, everybody's going to be there.
HAROLD: This room is full of ghosts.
LOOSELEAF: You're lucky, boy. My house is gonna be filled with people.
LOOSELEAF: You know what gets me?
HAROLD: Go home!
LOOSELEAF: Thank God we found the fucking diamonds!
HAROLD: The hell with the diamonds!
LOOSELEAF: You were rich before. This is the first time I was ever rich.
HAROLD: Go home! Show them how rich you are for a change!
LOOSELEAF: Can I have the Cadillac?
HAROLD: Take the Cadillac and drive it off a cliff, for all I care.
LOOSELEAF: What'll you do for transportation?
HAROLD: I'll buy a hundred more Cadillacs. Go home!
LOOSELEAF: You know what gets me about that Cadillac?
HAROLD: Go home!
LOOSELEAF: When I drive it, I feel like I'm in the middle of a great big wad of bubblegum. I don't hear anything, I don't feel anything. I figure somebody else is driving. It's a bitch.
HAROLD: Go home.
LOOSELEAF: I'm liable to find anything!
HAROLD: That's the point! Walk in there and find whatever there is to find--before Alice can cover it up.
LOOSELEAF: I know, I know. I dunno. At least she's in the same house. Sure was spooky, looking in the window there, and there she was.
HAROLD: So long, Colonel.
LOOSELEAF: You know what gets me?
HAROLD: Let's talk about it some other time.
LOOSELEAF: How short the skirts are.
HAROLD: Good night, Colonel. It's been beautiful.
LOOSELEAF: Something very important about sex must have happened while we were gone.
