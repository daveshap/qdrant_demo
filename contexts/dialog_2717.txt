CAPTAIN GROGAN: That's a very handsome sword you have there.
RODERICK: It was with this sword that my late father, Harry James, God rest his soul, met Sir Huddelstone Fuddelstone, the Hampshire baronet, and was fatally run through the neck. He was quite in the wrong, having insulted Lady Fuddelstone, when in liquor, at the Brentford Assembly. But, like a gentleman, he scorned to apologize.
CAPTAIN GROGAN: And now you risk the same fate. If you are killed, your mother is all alone in the world.
RODERICK: I am Harry James' son, and will act as becomes my name and quality.
RODERICK: I hope to spoil this sport, and trust to see this sword of mine in that big bully's body.
CAPTAIN GROGAN: Oh, it's with pistols we fight. You are no match for Best with the sword.
RODERICK: I'll match any man with the sword.
CAPTAIN GROGAN: But swords are today impossible; Captain Best is -- is lame. He knocked his knee against the swinging park gate last night, as he was riding home, and can scarce move it now.
RODERICK: Not against Castle Dugan gate, that has been off the hinges these ten years.
CAPTAIN GROGAN: It must have been some other gate.
