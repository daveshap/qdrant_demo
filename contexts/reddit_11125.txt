I will be turning 20 in an hour. Farewell r/teenagers
(Reposting cuz I'm stupid and forgot to flair)

Well I'm about to turn 20 years old so I thought it'd only be fitting to say goodbye. Even though I never posted here it's always been fun lurking here. In the last 7 years that I was a teenager, I've failed my high school, got kicked out of community college, been arrested, attempted suicide, and dealt with drug addiction. But I have turned most things around, and I'm in a happier place now. So here's some advice that I wish a had when I was younger (Take it with a grain of salt, since I'm young and was a troubled teenager.):

* **Take responsibility for your actions.** If something happens, fess up and deal with the consequences.

* **Stop obsessing what you look like.** Most people don't care what you look like, so stop obsessing over it, but do take care of your hygiene.

* **Don't compare someone's life with yours.**

* **Use a fucking condom, even if she tells you that she's on the pill.**

* **Put effort in the things you want to achieve.**

* **Do not start smoking.** Shits expensive af.

* **Do not say 'Sure, why not' when someone's offering you heroin at a camping site at a festival.**

* **Just do not do hard drugs in general.** Don't.

* **Know what resources are available to you.** Google it or ask your country's subreddit.

* **You will grow apart from a lot of your friends.** This is ok, just appreciate the friendships while they last.

* **Reach out to your friend with mental illness.** Just the invite itself can make somebody's week.

* **But don't be afraid to put yourself first, you can’t help others if you’re not ok.**

* **You are not defined by your disorder. You are not your disorder.** I believe you are a human.

* **Don’t be afraid to have a conversation or to seek professional help.** Be honest and kinder to yourself and those around you, your body and mind will be grateful for it.

See you later nerds.
