Which Statistic Test should I apply in the following scenarios I have a survey data with Yes/No response variable and a categorical variable assigning survey takers to one of the 4 groups:16-24 years old25-34 years old35-54 years old55+ years oldI want to test the significance of my hypothesis:  People in the age group 55+ are more likely to use smartphones. What test should I use to test this hypothesis. If I had to change the response variable to multiple categories, how would my choice of the statistical test be affected?
