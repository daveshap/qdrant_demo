I'm Finally worth $0
I've been waiting for this day since I began college, the day in which I can finally say that I'm worth **$0** because I have finally been able to pay off my undergrad loans. I came to this country with my family 15 years ago, and we've always been living paycheck to paycheck. I went to college where tuition was $65K, more than what my parents made a year, luckily the school was need-based and offered a pretty good financial aid package, though as every year progressed I was required to take out more loans. I was determined to ensure that my parents would not pay more than what was necessary, so I applied for fellowships, and internal scholarships. When I finally graduated I was in 10k worth of loans, I know it's not a lot compared to other graduates, but to someone who lived paycheck to paycheck, it was daunting. So I decided to do a year of service, in hopes of earning an education award that could be used to pay half of my loans. There were many times I wanted to quit, given that I was a recent graduate, and was yet again living paycheck to paycheck. I finished my year of service, moved back to my home state, with a job lined up. And dedicated my earnings to my student loans, and I have finally been able to pay off my students loans and can begin to save for my future.
