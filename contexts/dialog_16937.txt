PINTA: Could I ask you a question?
CREASY: Could I stop you?
PINTA: You don't drink like you used to.
CREASY: That's not a question.
PINTA: I know because I go in your room and check the bottles.
CREASY: Still not a question.
PINTA: My mom drinks, too... Why do people drink, Creasy?
CREASY: Now that's a question. I don't know about your Mom. For me, the problem isn't in the glass. The problem's in between my ears.
PINTA: You think too much?
CREASY: Yeah. Because at one time, I didn't think enough.
LISA: He has to go, Samuel.
SAMUEL: What? Who?
LISA: Creasy.
SAMUEL: Why? You were so pleased with him.
LISA: Pinta likes him too much. She thinks of him as a father.
SAMUEL: That's ridiculous.
LISA: It's not.
SAMUEL: I've just been so busy, Lisa.
LISA: He has to go.
