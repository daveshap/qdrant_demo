HELEN: You're fired.
ANDY: I know. Do come and meet your guest.
M.J.: We've got another one.
HELEN: That's no surprise.
M.J.: But it's a different m.o.
HELEN: Then what do you need me for?
M.J.: She was killed somewhere else and dumped outdoors in an empty lot. Where it says no dumping." Her legs pulled apart in a kind of sexual pose. It's all different but it seems so -- the same. Artificial and <u>posed</u>... Something's wrong with it."
HELEN: You're saying it's the same man, but he's changed his style? That doesn't happen. These men are robotic; the murder is like a ritual. The method itself is part of the pleasure...
M.J.: Who turned off the Internet computer...
HELEN: I turned it off. It's like an open window he can climb right in...
M.J.: He comes in the window, we maybe grab him. Where's the on-switch?
HELEN: Have you got a warrant? Get the hell out o here! This is the <u>only space I have left in the</u> <u>world</u>! Why can't you leave me out of it?
M.J.: Helen -- the killer directly contacted you. His interest in you is <u>intense</u>. I'm worried about you. I don't want to lose you. I know this stirs up every monster under the bed, but this is the only direct contact we have with him. The only chance we have to trap him. So, you can turn Internet back on, or I do, and we put somebody here on a 24 hour shift and you can kick, scream and hyperventilate.
HELEN: That little Winona Ryder manner... you're more convincing as Clint Eastwood.
M.J.: Clint is putting a guard on you. But if you swear to leave the computer on, Winona will assign him to the hall outside.
