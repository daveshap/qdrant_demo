RAE: Get out. We have nothing to talk about.
MAL: Rae, I need help.
RAE: Why come to me?
MAL: Because you're my sister. There's nobody else. The men who killed Daddy are after Jake. I gotta talk to him.
RAE: What's stopping you?
MAL: They're watching the Hollis place. I can't get through.
RAE: What makes you think I could?
MAL: Why would they stop you?
RAE: Because I'm your sister.
