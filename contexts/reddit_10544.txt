I just wish I'd get cancer or some incurable illness
Life just isn't worth living. When you've got the unfortunate mix of being unattractive, irratible, and dumb you realize how shitty the world is. I really want to kill myself but I love some people and would feel awful if my suicide effected them, even if it only affects them for a year at most. I just wish I'd get cancer and die so people could say it was bad luck instead.

I don't know. Maybe I should start smoking cigarettes or something. I wonder how many I'll have to smoke to get the desired results
