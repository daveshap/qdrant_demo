MOZART: Another? But that's too soon! Tomorrow night? It's impossible! Did he say a hundred?
SALIERI: Yes. Can I - could I help you, in any way?
MOZART: Would you? Actually, you could.
SALIERI: My dear friend, it would be my greatest pleasure.
MOZART: But you'd have to swear not to tell a soul. I'm not allowed.
SALIERI: Of course.
MOZART: You know, it's all here in my head. It's just ready to be set down. But when I'm dizzy like this my eyes won't focus. I can't write.
SALIERI: Then, let us try together. I'd regard it as such an honour. Tell me, what is this work?
MOZART: A Mass. A Mass for the Dead.
OFFICER: What is it?
CONSTANZE: I want to go!
OFFICER: Where?
CONSTANZE: I want to go back to Vienna.
OFFICER: Now?
CONSTANZE: Yes!
OFFICER: Why?
CONSTANZE: I feel wrong. I feel wrong being here.
OFFICER: What are you talking about?
MOZART: Where did I stop?
SALIERI: The end of the Recordare - Statuens in parte dextra.
MOZART: So now the Confutatis. Confutatis Maledictis. When the wicked are confounded. Flammis acribus addictis. How would you translate that?
SALIERI: Consigned to flames of woe.
MOZART: Do you believe in it?
SALIERI: What?
MOZART: A fire which never dies. Burning one forever?
SALIERI: Oh, yes.
MOZART: Strange!
SALIERI: Come. Let's begin.
SALIERI: Confutatis Maledictis.
MOZART: We ended in F Major?
SALIERI: Yes.
MOZART: So now - A minor. Suddenly.
MOZART: The Fire.
SALIERI: What time?
MOZART: Common time.
MOZART: Start with the voices. Basses first. Second beat of the first measure - A. Con-fu-ta-tis. Second measure, second beat. Ma-le-dic-tis. G-sharp, of course.
SALIERI: Yes.
MOZART: Third measure, second beat starting on E. Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis. And fourth measure, fourth beat - D. Ma-le-dic-tis, flam-mis a-cri-bus ad- dic-tis. Do you have that?
SALIERI: I think so.
MOZART: Sing it back.
MOZART: Good. Now the tenors. Fourth beat of the first measure - C. Con-fu-ta-tis. Second measure, fourth beat on D. Ma-le-dic-tis. All right?
SALIERI: Yes.
MOZART: Fourth measure, second beat - F. Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis, flam- mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis.
MOZART: Now the orchestra. Second bassoon and bass trombone with the basses. Identical notes and rhythm. The first bassoon and tenor trombone -
SALIERI: Please! Just one moment.
MOZART: It couldn't be simpler.
SALIERI: First bassoon and tenor trombone - what?
MOZART: With the tenors.
SALIERI: Also identical?
MOZART: Exactly. The instruments to go with the voices. Trumpets and timpani, tonic and dominant.
SALIERI: And that's all?
MOZART: Oh no. Now for the Fire. Strings in unison - ostinato on all - like this.
