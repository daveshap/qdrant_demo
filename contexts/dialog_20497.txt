HUEY: You were alright Judge, better than alright. You're what the Party needs. A fighter but also one that's going to school not making the man too nervous.
JUDGE: I don't know about that.
HUEY: I do. You think you're smart enough to keep playing the game?
JUDGE: What, I don't know how you mean?
HUEY: See, the thing about Panthers. For all their speed and strength. They are not naturally aggressive. They don't just go out killing, tearing through the jungles murdering. No, the Panther keeps his claws hidden until he is attacked, until he's backed into a corner. Then believe me those claws are fierce.
JUDGE: Huey, you're losing me. What are you talking about?
HUEY: I'm talking about survival. Yours, mine, all of it. Outside and in. You got to do something for me. Staying alive might depend on it. The pigs are gonna try to infiltrate us and we're gonna let 'em. But their spy's gonna be our spy too. How about it?
JUDGE: Me? You've got a whole lot of other folks signing up. Why me?
HUEY: You fit the profile, Brother. You look exactly like the kind of nigger they think they can trust...
