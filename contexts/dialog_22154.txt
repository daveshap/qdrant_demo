LUKE: Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother?
LEIA: Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.
LUKE: What do you remember?
LEIA: Just...images, really. Feelings.
LUKE: Tell me.
LEIA: She was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad. Why are you asking me all this?
LUKE: I have no memory of my mother. I never knew her.
LEIA: Luke, tell me. What's troubling you?
LUKE: Vader is here...now, on this moon.
