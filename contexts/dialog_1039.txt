ADDISON: After you change, if you're not busy elsewhere, we can have supper.
EVE: I'd love to! Or should I pretend I'm busy?
ADDISON: Let's have a minimum of pretending. I'll want to do a column about you-
EVE: I'm not enough for a paragraph.
ADDISON: - perhaps more than one. There's so much I want to know. I've heard your story in bits and pieces... your home in Wisconsin, your tragic marriage, your financial attachment to Margo - it started in San Francisco, didn't it? I say - your idolatry of Margo started in San Francisco, didn't it?
EVE: That's right.
ADDISON: San Francisco. An oasis of civilization in the California desert. Tell me, do you share my high opinion of San Francisco?
EVE: Yes. I do.
ADDISON: And that memorable night when Margo first dazzled you from the stage - which theater was it in San Francisco? Was it - the Shubert?
EVE: Yes. The Shubert.
ADDISON: A fine old theater, the Shubert. Full of tradition, untouched by the earthquake - so sorry - fire... by the way, what was your husband's name?
EVE: Eddie...
ADDISON: Eddie what?
EVE: I'm about to go into the shower, I won't be able to hear you...
ADDISON: I can wait. Where would you like to go? We'll make this a special night...
EVE: You take charge.
ADDISON: I believe I will.
