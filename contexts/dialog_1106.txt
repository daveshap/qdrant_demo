BERNSTEIN: --I want you to shut up and listen to me--
WOODWARD: --I haven't said anything--
BERNSTEIN: --for the first time I'm beginning to feel like a fucking reporter-- Woodward, I got a tip. A guy called me up with a tip-- --someone named Donald Segretti contacted a bunch of lawyers and asked them if they'd like to go to work with him screwing up the Democrats, dirty tricks, shit like that. The FBI knows about Segretti-- Howard Hunt made a bunch of phone calls to him--they interrogated him, but on account of Segretti wasn't involved with the break-in, they didn't follow through. But Segretti did a lot of traveling--he called these lawyers from different places, and he told them the Republicans knew what he was doing.
WOODWARD: How high up, which Republicans?
BERNSTEIN: That's what we've got to find out, but Segretti went to Southern Cal. and so did a bunch of Nixon men--
WOODWARD: --Haldeman I know, who else?
BERNSTEIN: Dwight Chapin, Nixon's appointments chief--he knew Segretti in school. Maybe I'm crazy, but this is the first time any of this starts to make sense. What were the three theories?
WOODWARD: The burglary was done by Cubans or Democrats or Republicans.
BERNSTEIN: Now the reason no one believed the Republicans is because there wasn't any reason, they were so far ahead. But Segretti was talking to these other lawyers a year before the break- in.
WOODWARD: So maybe Watergate wasn't really about Watergate--maybe that was just a piece--
BERNSTEIN: --because a year before, the Republicans weren't ahead, not in the polls, Muskie was running ahead of Nixon then. Before he self- destructed.
WOODWARD: If he self-destructed.
WOODWARD: Segretti criss-crossed the country over ten times in six months--and never stayed anyplace over a night or two. Switch to another station, huh? You're driving me crazy with that.
BERNSTEIN: Segovia begged me for me secret but I said, No
WOODWARD: California, Illinois, Florida, New Hampshire--all the major Democratic primary states. Why does everything you play sound the same?
BERNSTEIN: --'cause I only know four chords--
BERNSTEIN: Donald Segretti?
SEGRETTI: That's right.
BERNSTEIN: I'm Carl Bernstein. My paper sent me out to see if I couldn't persuade you to go on the record.
SEGRETTI: You can't.
BERNSTEIN: Mind if I try?
BERNSTEIN: According to what we've been able to verify, you've been busy.
SEGRETTI: I've got a lot of energy.
BERNSTEIN: Listen--we know you're involved in this--we're going to get the story, why not help?
SEGRETTI: They never told me anything except my own role--I had to find out the rest in the papers.
BERNSTEIN: By they" you mean...?"
BERNSTEIN: By they" you mean the White House
SEGRETTI: I know where Dwight works.
BERNSTEIN: When did he hire you?
BERNSTEIN: Do you feel much about the things you did?
SEGRETTI: I didn't do anything wrong.
BERNSTEIN: Tell that to Muskie.
SEGRETTI: Oh, maybe nickel and dime stuff.
BERNSTEIN: During the Florida primary, you wrote a letter on Muskie stationery saying Scoop Jackson had a bastard child. You wrote another that said Hubert Humphrey was out with call girls.
SEGRETTI: Sometimes it got up to a quarter maybe-- --off the record.
BERNSTEIN: You wrote the Canuck letter--the one where you claimed Muskie slurred the Canadians.
SEGRETTI: I didn't.
BERNSTEIN: But you know who did.
SEGRETTI: When you guys print it in the paper, then I'll know. I'm a lawyer, and I'll probably go to jail, and be disbarred, and what did I do that was so awful?
SEGRETTI: None of it was my idea, Carl--I didn't go looking for the job.
BERNSTEIN: Chapin did contact you then?
SEGRETTI: Sure--off the record.
BERNSTEIN: On the orders of Haldeman?
SEGRETTI: I don't know anything about Haldeman, except, Dwight's frightened of him-- everybody's frightened of him--Christ, I wish I'd never gotten messed around with this--all I wanna do is sit in the sun; sit, swim, see some girls.
BERNSTEIN: It gets interesting if it was Haldeman, because our word is that when Chapin says something, he's gotten the OK from Haldeman, and when Haldeman says something, he's gotten the OK from the President.
SEGRETTI: Can't help you.
BERNSTEIN: At USC, you had a word the this-- screwing up the opposition you all did it at college and called it ratfucking. Ever wonder if Nixon might turn out to be the biggest ratfucker of them all?
