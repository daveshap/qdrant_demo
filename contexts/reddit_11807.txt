My job offer got rescinded.
Well it's that time of year again, when university students scramble to find a good job for the summer, both for some extra income as well as experience. In late February, I interviewed for a position that I was interested in and got the job shortly after. I was told that I would get an information, etc package emailed to me in a couple of weeks.

Then last week I got a call from HR telling me that my job offer is no longer valid. Either they didn't give a reason or it was because they "accidentally hired too many people", I can't really remember because I was too shocked. They offered me another interview as a consolation, but I don't know my chances this time around. Meanwhile the rest of my friends are all accepting their offers (I'm happy for them, because I know how it feels). Now I'm back to constant worrying about what I'm going to do for the entire summer if nobody wants me.
