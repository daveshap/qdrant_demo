THE MARQUIS: I should've told you it was the blood of Christ; you'd believe that, wouldn't you?
COULMIER: We treat you well enough here, don't we Marquis? Your very own featherbed, in lieu of a straw mat. Your antique writing desk, all the way from LaCoste. Enough quills to feather an ostrich --
THE MARQUIS: It's true, dear-heart, you've spoiled me pink.
COULMIER: In exchange, we ask only that you follow the rules. Now you know as well as I do... you're not to entertain visitors in your quarters.
THE MARQUIS: I'm entertaining you now, aren't I?
COULMIER: I'm not a beautiful young prospect, ripe for corruption.
THE MARQUIS: Don't be so sure.
COULMIER: Take your pen in hand, Marquis. Purge these wicked thoughts of yours on paper; maybe they'll govern you less in life.
THE MARQUIS: I'll fill page after page, I promise.
