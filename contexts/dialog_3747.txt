DECKARD: I'd like you to take a look at these pictures.
TAFFEY: Of course.
TAFFEY: You see I lost my contacts a couple of days ago around here somewhere and my sight is a little... What am I supposed to be looking for?
DECKARD: Do you recognize any of them?
TAFFEY: This one looks familiar, but I don't know. Naw. There's one came in today looks a little like this one but...
DECKARD: What did she want?
TAFFEY: Who?
DECKARD: The girl that doesn't look like that girl.
TAFFEY: Nothing. She wanted to know about suck night.
DECKARD: What night?
TAFFEY: I didn't know if I wanted to handle her -- I already got a snake act. But my partner goes down there to the Opera House on suck night to book the good ones.
DECKARD: What's suck night?
TAFFEY: That's what we call in the trade, audition free-for- alls and most of it sucks. Bit I don't think that's her.
DECKARD: You talking about the Opera House on the Main?
DECKARD: Book the good ones for where?
TAFFEY: Lots of places. The tours, the clubs, the Silicone shows, private parties.
DECKARD: What shows?
TAFFEY: Silicone Valley. Lots of these science guys never leave that place. We book two shows a month in there. Those big time techs and bio- guys might be real high zoners up here, but when it comes to the arts, they like it loud and lewd.
