ROSEN: And how's your job?
WALTER: The job's okay.
ROSEN: Do I take okay" to mean you feel good about working there?"
WALTER: I said the job is okay.
ROSEN: That's right, you did. Have you made any friends there?
WALTER: I'm not running for Mr. Popularity.
ROSEN: You seem a little hostile today.
WALTER: That was a joke.
WALTER: It's called sarcasm, Dr. Rosen.
ROSEN: No need to call me doctor. I'm a therapist, not a psychiatrist.
WALTER: It's all the same.
ROSEN: Walter, I'd like you to try something for me.
WALTER: What?
ROSEN: I'd like you to keep a journal.
WALTER: A diary?
ROSEN: That's right.
WALTER: No way.
ROSEN: Why not?
WALTER: Diaries have sent too many guys to prison.
ROSEN: I don't understand.
WALTER: Ev-i-dence.
ROSEN: Oh. It never crossed my mind.
WALTER: Of course.
ROSEN: It was just an idea.
WALTER: Bad idea.
ROSEN: I thought a journal would encourage you to reflect.
WALTER: Reflect.
ROSEN: That's right.
WALTER: You think reflection is good.
ROSEN: It's very good, indeed.
WALTER: How's that?
ROSEN: By reflection we can derive a deeper meaning from our experience in life. We gain greater understanding about ourselves that can lead to making better choices in our relationships, our careers, and our goals.
