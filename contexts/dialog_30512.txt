MADISON: The rally's a little obvious as a target, don't you think?
PARKER: I told you before, Grimes liked to be obvious.
MADISON: Sid 6.7 isn't Grimes.
PARKER: Part of him is.
MADISON: If we find Sid, Lindenmeyer won't be far behind.
PARKER: Think he's keeping track of his creation?
MADISON: That, or living through him...
PARKER: See something?
MADISON: I'm not sure...on the bridge...the guy at the payphone...
PARKER: Nice work.
MADISON: Thanks.
