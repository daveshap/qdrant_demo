Splitting event data into training and testing with all the events in training ending before the events in testing starts I have a dataset with event data. It has a date of start and date of finish vareiable. I need to predict time remaining until an event finishes. The problem is that I can't use events in future time to predict events before that date. That is why I need to somehow split the data into training set with only events that finish before the events in the testing dataset start and still maintain a nice 75/25 or 80/20 split. Any ideas?Thanks!Some clarification of the problem: Events are actually aggregated cases with one-hot encoded columns of different type of events as counts of occurance. The problem is to predict the actual time remaining until the end of an event. The reason for this particular split, is that you can't use events that happen in the future, to predict the remaining time of cases (and therefore events belonging to this case). If you do that, it is assumed that they are independent, but they are actually not.
