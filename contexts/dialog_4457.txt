CONNOR: Well, the light caught the side of his face for a second. And it looked like he had a gray beard, maybe... late fifties, early sixties.
SMECKER: So you're telling me it was one guy with six guns? A-and he was a senior fucking citizen?
CONNOR: I think it's better if we find this man before he finds us again.
SMECKER: I'll see what I can do. How do I get in touch with you?
CONNOR: We're going to hit Poppa Joe tonight, right in the comfort of his own home. Then we move on to New York. It's getting a bit hot for us here.
SMECKER: Be careful.
CONNOR: I'll call you tonight, afterwards.
