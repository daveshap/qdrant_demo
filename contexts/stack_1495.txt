Which type of capacitor to use for matching the data sheet? I want to choose decoupling capacitors for some microcontroller peripherals, which in their data sheets only specify some capacitans. Since you have quite a choice of passive components and the data sheets not always specify which type to use (ceramic, some electrolytic, aluminum or tantalum) I feel insecure.The data sheet says to use a 1uF and a 0.1uF cap. I feel sure that the 0.1uF one could be a ceramic. But could the 1uF be one to? I want to operate at 3.3V will a 1uF ceramic cap lose to much capacity to make the recommended 1uF. And is a 0402 cap as good as a 0603 for the same capacity?Thank you for any help!
