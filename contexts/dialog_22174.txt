JANET: Oh....Say something.
BRAD: Say! Do any of you guys know the Madison?
JANET: Brad, please lets get out of here.
BRAD: For God's sake keep a grip on yourself Janet.
JANET: But it seems so unhealthy here.
BRAD: It's just a..a party Janet.
JANET: Well I want to leave.
BRAD: We can't go anywhere until I get to a phone.
JANET: Then ask the butler - or someone.
BRAD: Let's wait awhile Janet. We don't want to interfere with their celebrations.
JANET: This isn't the Junior Chamber of Commerce Brad.
BRAD: They're probably foreigners with ways different from our own. - They may do some more folk dancing.
JANET: Brad - I'm cold, I'm wet, and plain scared.
BRAD: I'm here, there's nothing to worry about.
