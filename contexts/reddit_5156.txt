Is it a wise to apply to a new position opening in a company listing right after your application for another postion (within the same company) is rejected?
So around two weeks ago I sent my resume in to this position within a company. Received the standard rejection letter today ' we regret to inform you that we have decided not to move forward with your application for this role. We will keep your resume on file for future opportunities.' blah blah blah

Checked the companies vacancy list and saw another position( quite a different position than the last one, quality assurance testor vs customer service rep) that I reckon I have the experience and ability for.

I'm just wondering if its wise to put in another application? Since the recruiters must have just seen my last resume & cover letter would that create a bad impression?

P.S: I really liked the company that im applying for (yeah I know it sounds a bit naive and stupid) and really wanted to work for them and thats why I want to keep trying.
