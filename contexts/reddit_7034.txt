If I have equity at work, is it okay to ask for a raise closer to market rate?
I have been working at a startup for 3 years now. I'm a founding member and worked without salary (for equity) for about a year and a few months. Fortunately, things have been going well for us and we've been growing at a steady pace. About a year ago, we hired another woman at my level of seniority: about 7 years in the industry. I recently found out she's making more money per year than I am (about $15k more, $20k more would get me to market rate). I know she has less equity than I do, but this still feels unfair because I've been here 2 years longer, and have never received a raise. I currently oversee production in my department, we bring in the majority of new revenue, and the CEO has commented on it.

I want to ask for a raise but I'm not sure if it's standard in the industry to pay a founding member below market rate in exchange for higher equity. There's some additional tension in that I am the only woman of color in the company (person of color, really). I feel a little bit taken advantage of right now. Any advice on how to proceed?
