HR called me to interview me for a job they didn't know I already interviewed for then the next day I was told I didn't get the job.
So I interviewed at a company which I know went extremely well. The interviewer told me that he loved me but the only thing is that somebody from within the company is applying for my position and he might get priority. Aside from that, he said he will try to get me to come in to replace the spot of the employee from within the company. I was told I'd hear back in a few weeks and I really felt confident in hearing some good news. Fast forward a few weeks and I get a call from the company. The HR recruiter told me she'd like to bring me in for an interview and I awkwardly told her that I already interviewed for the job she's calling me about. She felt really embarrassed and just said "really? I'm sorry who did you interview with?" I told her who and she told me she will talk to him and get back to me. I'm sitting here thinking okay this isn't very organized but I must have a good shot if two different people called me to interview. 

A few days later I got an email saying that under really careful consideration, I did not get the job. 

Wtf?
