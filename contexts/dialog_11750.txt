ANNIE: You got everything you need?
GRACE: If I had everything I need, I wouldn't be going to physical therapy.
ANNIE: Honey, come on. Would you like to stay in town for dinner? Maybe see what movie's playing tonight?
GRACE: Why? There's no food in the house?
ANNIE: No. I just thought... forget it.
TOM: You know, we're branding here tomorrow. If you two want to come by to watch or give a hand, you're welcome.
ANNIE: Branding? I haven't branded in years.
GRACE: I'll come.
ANNIE: Uh, I don't, honey. Branding? Oooh... I think we'd just be in Mr. Booker's way.
