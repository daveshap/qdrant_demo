If I’m more than 2 minutes late, I often don’t go to a class out of fear of what others will think
EDIT: So last i heckled this was at like 40 likes and I thought “well ok. A few people feel like this so that’s nice I’m not alone.” 

Now I know I’m not alone out there in this. Thanks for the support, peeps
