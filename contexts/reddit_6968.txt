got fired..
So after 3 months of working in customer service (at a bakery), i got fired because i wasn't "motivated" enough, didn't smile enough, wasn't fast enough etc etc. I'm a really shy person but i was really doing my best and didn't think i was that horrible. The other job i had before i quit after a few months bc i was not getting payed all my hours... I will eventually look for another job and i wouldn't mind doing customer service at a nice place. I'd really like to work on my interpersonal skills and all. What can i say in an interview if they ask me why i stopped working there??
