Read temperature sensor from microcontroller to Android application (via microUSB) I'm working on a concept for a project, and I'm having difficulty determining whether this application is possible. I will have some misc. microcontroller with an attached temperature sensor, and that microcontroller will be connected to an Android device via Micro USB. Is it possible to read that sensor and display results on the Android application, or are there hardware limitations to this?Having the microcontroller send data to a server is not an option, as one of the main purposes of the project is for the Android device to handle most of the work and the microcontroller will not have network capabilities.
