ERIN: What's going on? What are you doing?
GEORGE: Thinking.
ERIN: About what?
GEORGE: About this.
ERIN: What's that?
GEORGE: It's a pair of earrings. I saw 'em in the mall one day, and I thought, damn, those would look good on those beautiful earlobes. So I bought 'em. And I said to myself, next time Erin says something nice, does something nice, I'll surprise her with 'em. Know how long ago that was? Six months. In six months, you haven't said one nice thing to me. That's a long time.
ERIN: I'm sorry. I'm just working so hard --
GEORGE: I know. But still. Six months. I think you oughta either find a different job or a different boyfriend. Cause there may be men who don't mind being the maid and getting nothing in return, but I'm sure as shit not one of 'em.
ERIN: I can't leave my job, George.
GEORGE: Yeah, you can. You could just quit. People do it all the time.
ERIN: I can't. Look -- this job -- it's the best thing that ever happened to me. I mean it. For the first time in my life, I got people respecting me. Up in Hinkley, I walk into a room and everyone shuts up just to hear what I got to say. I never had that. Ever. Don't ask me to give it up. I need it.
GEORGE: More than you need me.
ERIN: I need it.
