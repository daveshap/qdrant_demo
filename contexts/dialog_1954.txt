CORBETT: Go ahead. Take the jeep. I'll come to Cache with Bob when he gets here.
MITCHELL: Okay by me. You're the one likes these hot springs so much.
CORBETT: Leave my traps. We'll tag up, couple days.

WILDER: I was making my rounds, saw your hangar wide open, plane getting rained on, so I closed it up.
ERIC: Thanks.
ANNE MARIE: I bet you haven't had lunch.
WILDER: Bet you're right. But I didn't come by to wangle a meal --
ERIC: -- We appreciate the company. Anne Marie's getting cabin fever already.
WILDER: What'd you say they call these spaceships?
ERIC: Mobile Arctic Dwelling -- MAD.
ANNE MARIE: I call it 'the Turtle,' as in carrying your home on your back.
ERIC: Best thing is, Meyerling has to chase around to find us.
ANNE MARIE: The little creep hates it that Eric actually does what the company hired him to do.
WILDER: Watch it with Meyerling. Man's as mean and corrupt as they get. Cut his mother's throat if it'd get him a couple votes.

ERIC: Hey, Sam, look over there. Black and white smoke.
WILDER: Damn. Likely that's an SOS. Have to pass on that lunch.
ERIC: We'll go with you.
