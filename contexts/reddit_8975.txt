Everyone is talking about how long it's been since Hillary did a press conference, but what is considered a 'normal' amount of press conferences?
I guess I can frame this question both for Presidential Candidates and President in general. Is there a public record anywhere for this?

It's been 275 days since Hillary had a press conference, source: http://uk.businessinsider.com/hillary-clinton-mounting-pressure-press-conference-2016-9?r=US&IR=T
