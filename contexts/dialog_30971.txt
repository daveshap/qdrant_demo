ZUKERMAN: In a hurry, are we?
TED: I was in the middle of a melodramatic exit. It wouldn't really make a statement if I tiptoed out the door...What are you selling?
ZUKERMAN: Bad news.
TED: People pay good money for that?
ZUKERMAN: I'm just a messenger.
TED: Oh no. No way. I've had all the bad news I can take for one day.
ZUKERMAN: It's about your parents.
TED: My parents? What do you mean?
ZUKERMAN: I'm terrible at this. I blurt. I'm a blurter. Your parents...They ...well...they exist no further. Skinny-dipping. The Amazon. Piranhas. It wasn't pretty.
TED: You've got the wrong guy. The closest my parents have been to the Amazon is the Brazilian pavilion at Epcot.
ZUKERMAN: Well kid, I'm speaking of...your biological parents.
