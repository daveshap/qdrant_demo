How to break up with a friend in the most peaceful way possible?
I’d love for us to slide off of each other but the thing is, it’ll probably takes a long long time and I’m not that all patient.

So here’s a little background information:

The reason why I want to break this off with my friend is simple: I can’t stand spending time with her anymore. And it’s just that, plain and simple. I don’t want to be with her, I think she’s annoying and I’d rather my own company, it cost me so much patience to not explode and I don’t want to deal with that anymore.

(We have a history as to why I feel this way towards her, you can look at my profile for reference but there’s a lot of rant and so so) 

Long story short, how do I tell her this in the most polite way possible? How should I manage to react if she storms out or any aggressive reaction?
