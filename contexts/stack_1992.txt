What is the lingustic term for a language's usage conventions? Every language has usage conventions that cannot be deducted from a basic dictionary. For example, to describe highly concentrated tea, English speakers will usually use \"strong tea\". Is there a scientific/linguistic term for such conventions/word pairings?
