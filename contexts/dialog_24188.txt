ICHABOD: An honor, gentlemen. In time I will need every detail of the three murderings you've had, but, for now, I ask only if you have any theory at all as to who the killer might be?
DOCTOR LANCASTER: Excuse me?
ICHABOD: I say, is there any one person suspect in these acts?
DOCTOR LANCASTER: I was afraid of this.
PHILIPSE: Well, Constable... are you aware... to be honest, you are not what we expected. We sent for the militia.
ICHABOD: The militia?
FATHER STEENWYCK: Why not tell us what you have heard? Hmm? How much have your superiors bothered to tell you?
ICHABOD: All I know is three are slain, their heads found severed from their bodies...
FATHER STEENWYCK: The heads were not found severed. The heads were not found at all.
HARDENBROOK: Taken. Taken by the Headless Horseman. Taken back to hell.
ICHABOD: Pardon me?
