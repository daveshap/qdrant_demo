In love with my best friend and it's killing me
I am so fucking in love with my best friend that it's mentally killing me. It's going on 2 years now and what's more is that he's the same sex as I am, straight and taken. I didn't ask to be gay. I didn't ask to like him. I wish I was as straight as an arrow because fuck that would make my life so much easier. 

We're in high school and seeing him is unavoidable considering I sit right next to him. I feel like killing myself. Would be so much easier than this. 

He hurts me a lot but that is to be expected for liking the same sex. He doesn't do it on purpose so I can't blame him for it or talk to him about this since he doesn't know about this thing I have for him. 

I try to find the bad things in him but he's always so considerate and kind and thinking bad about him makes me want to throw up. 

He's so beautiful it kills me. 
And I don't know what else to do. 

please help
