MACAULAY: How are you? Here. Get under this.
DOROTHY: Thanks... we're taking your cab.
MACAULAY: Is your father still in there?
DOROTHY: He's waiting for you.
MACAULAY: Did he tell you where he was going?
DOROTHY: He wouldn't say.
MACAULAY: Tch-tch-tch -- Well, goodbye, Miss Wynant. You wouldn't drive slowly, so you don't get a tip.
