I'm starting to feel like a leech on society
I figured out that I've taken in more in SNAP and Medicaid benefits than I've paid in taxes over the past decade. While I am extremely thankful for these safety nets, I feel ashamed that I am a net drain on society, at least in fiscal terms. Anyone else feel like this? I hope to turn it all around one of these days, but I'm starting to lose hope.
