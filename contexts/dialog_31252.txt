SCHAEFFER: How reliable is this kid?
BOOK: Oh, he's good.
SCHAEFFER: Amish.
BOOK: Yeah.
SCHAEFFER: What have you got?
BOOK: Zenovitch was about to deliver a list of names tonight – street chemists... the guys processing this P2P into speed.
SCHAEFFER: So one of them got to him.
BOOK: Maybe.
SCHAEFFER: You know who?
BOOK: Maybe.
SCHAEFFER: You're still convinced there's a link to the department?
BOOK: If there isn't I've just wasted the last six months.
SCHAEFFER: That's the problem. We need results. The press is driving us crazy over this P2P thing. Calling us the 'speed capitol of the country'. You know the sort of thing. It's getting political. The Commissioner's getting very uneasy.
BOOK: The Amish boy saw him, Paul. I'll make it, but Set Donahue and the Homicide Department off my back or they'll blow the whole thing.
SCHAEFFER: When word gets out that Zenovitch was a cop, all hell will break lose. You've got 24 hours. That's all I can give you. 24 hours on your own. After that the case and the witness go back to the Homicide Department.
SCHAEFFER: Tell you what... why don't you and that blonde – what's-her-name – come over for dinner Sunday. How 'bout that.
BOOK: What's-her-name moved to Buffalo.
SCHAEFFER: Well, anyway, don't get crazy. I'll do something for Zenovich's wife.
CARTER: I got there late, John.
BOOK: Let's just find Coalmine. Listen, Zenovich made a mistake. You didn't let anybody down. It happens –
CARTER: It won't happen again.
RACHEL: Where are you taking us?
BOOK: We're looking for a suspect. We've reason to believe he's still in the area.
RACHEL: You have no right to keep us here.
BOOK: Yes I do. Your son is a material witness to a homicide.
RACHEL: You don't understand, we have nothing to do with your laws!
BOOK: Doesn't surprise me. I meet a lot of people like that.
RACHEL: It's not a joke.
