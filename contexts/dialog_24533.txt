MULLIGAN: Better bring the check now - in case the joint gets raided.
WAITER: Who's going to raid a funeral?
MULLIGAN: Some people got no respect for the dead.
JERRY: Say, Joe - tonight's the night, isn't it?
JOE: I'll say.
JERRY: I mean, we get paid tonight, don't we?
JOE: Yeah. Why?
JERRY: Because I lost a filling in my back tooth. I gotta go to the dentist tomorrow.
JOE: Dentist? We been out of work for four months - and you want to blow your first week's pay on your teeth?
JERRY: It's just a little inlay - it doesn't even have to be gold -
JOE: How can you be so selfish? We owe back rent - we're in four eighty-nine bucks to Moe's Delicatessen - we're being sued by three Chinese lawyers because our check bounced at the laundry - we've borrowed money from every girl in the line -
JERRY: You're right, Joe.
JOE: Of course I am.
JERRY: First thing tomorrow we're going to pay everybody a little something on account.
JOE: No we're not.
JERRY: We're not?
JOE: First thing tomorrow we're going out to the dog track and put the whole bundle on Greased Lightning.
JERRY: You're going to bet my money on a dog?
JOE: He's a shoo-in. I got the word from Max the waiter - his brother-in-law is the electrician who wires the rabbit -
JERRY: What are you giving me with the rabbit?
JOE: Look at those odds - ten to one. If he wins, we can pay everybody.
JERRY: But suppose he loses?
JOE: What are you worried about? This job is going to last a long time.
JERRY: But suppose it doesn't?
JOE: Jerry-boy - why do you have to paint everything so black? Suppose you get hit by a truck? Suppose the stock market crashes?
JOE: Suppose Mary Pickford divorces Douglas Fairbanks?
JERRY: Hey, Joe!
JOE: Suppose Lake Michigan overflows?
JERRY: Don't look now - but the whole town is under water!
