i went to a bookstore and got a coffee by myself today!
i have severe anxiety and it is really difficult for me to do things by myself; i like to have someone with me as it helps me feel less pressured. however, i decided to go to barnes and noble (bookstore) alone today, and they have a cafe in there. the first time i ended up leaving the bookstore without getting a coffee because i was too nervous, but i ended up going back twenty minutes later and got one!! it was so easy, and the barista was very friendly which helped so much. iâ€™m so proud of myself, and iâ€™m so happy. i started to feel a little overwhelmed and almost left again but i did it!! i hope you all are able to silence your anxiety like i did today, and if not, thereâ€™s always tomorrow ðŸ’›
