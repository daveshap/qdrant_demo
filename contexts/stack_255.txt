Make Ctrl-k in Terminal copy to the system clipboard I'd like whatever I last \"cut\" with Ctrl-k in Terminal to be available in my text editor when I hit Cmd-v. Is that possible? Or something close?Update with additional explanation: Ctrl-k is by default in Terminal \"delete to end of line\". As well as deleting it puts the deleted text into the Terminal's clipboard (emacs \"kill ring\") and it can be retrieved with Ctrl-y. This is essentially a second clipboard separate from the system clipboard. I want to use the same clipboard for Terminal and for the rest of the system such as my text editor.
