My mental illness makes me feel childish and immature
I have struggled with anxiety and depression for most of my life. I got my first job 2 years ago. In that time, I have had 4 anxiety attacks/breakdowns at work. It happened just last week. I had really hoped that wasn't going to happen again but it did, and I feel so humiliated. Most of my coworkers are my age or younger and they don't act like that. They don't hide in a closet crying and panicking for two hours. 

I also have a bunch of physical health problems that have caused me to have to leave early and call out numerous times. So I can't help feeling that I'm the problem child at work and everyone must think I'm such a drama queen. There's always *something* going on with me. 

I really try to hide it. I try to tough it out when I can and find private places to rest for a minute when I need it. I try not to let people see me get upset. I wish I could help people understand that I don't *want* to do this or be like this. They never say anything, but I'm certain they're silently judging me.

Anyway... yeah. Anxiety sucks.
