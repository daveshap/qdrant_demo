DUKE: What made you do it? Who paid you off?
MAID: Nobody. I'm the maid!
GONZO: You're lying! You were after the evidence. Who put you up to this -- the manager?
MAID: I don't know what you're talking about!
GONZO: Bullshit! You're just as much a part of it as they are!
MAID: Part of what?
DUKE: The dope ring. You must know what's going on in this hotel. Why do you think we're here?
MAID: I know you're cops, but I thought you were just here for that convention. I swear! All I wanted to do was clean up the room. I don't know anything about dope!
GONZO: Come on, baby don't try to tell us you never heard of the Grange Gorman.
MAID: No! No! I swear to Jesus I never heard of that stuff!
DUKE: Maybe she's telling the truth. Maybe she's not part of it.
MAID: No! I swear I'm not!
GONZO: In that case, maybe she can help.
MAID: Yes! I'll help you all you need! I hate dope!
DUKE: So do we, lady.
GONZO: I think we should put her on the payroll. See what she comes up with.
DUKE: Do you think you can handle it?
MAID: What?
GONZO: One phone call every day. Just tell us what you've seen. Don't worry if it doesn't add up, that's our problem.
MAID: You'd pay me for that?
DUKE: You're damn right. But the first time you say anything about this, to anybody -- you'll go straight to prison for the rest of your life. What's your name?
MAID: Alice. Just ring Linen Service and ask for Alice.
GONZO: Alright, Alice... you'll be contacted by Inspector Rock. Arthur Rock. He'll be posing as a politician.
DUKE: Inspector Rock will pay you. In cash. A thousand dollars on the ninth of every month.
MAID: Oh Lord! I'd do just about anything for that!
GONZO: You and a lot of other people.
DUKE: The password is: One Hand Washes The Other." The minute you hear that
MAID: I fear nothing.
GONZO: Oh, and don't bother to make up the room. That way we won't have to risk another of these little incidents, will we?
MAID: Whatever you say, gentlemen. I can't tell you how sorry I am about what happened...
GONZO: Don't worry, it's all over now. Thank God for the decent people.
