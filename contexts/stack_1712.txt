Designing a sequence detector(0110) I asked to design a sequence detector to detect 0110 and when this sequence happend turn it's output to 1 for 2 clock cycles.Here is what I designed:But the problem is it turns the output to 1, one clock cycle late IE if it encountered 0110 it doesn't turn output to 1 but instead it turns output to 1 on next positive edge of clk as you can see in below timing diagram.I tried so much to solve it but I can't :(Can someone help me pleaseEdit: I have to add I know the problem is: y2 D flip flop is synchronised with Q1 D flip flop but what to do instead?Edit 2:New state diagram Edit 3:New state diagram
