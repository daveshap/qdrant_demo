Life Pro Tip: Do NOT constantly be watching the news on this stuff
Keep informed on key updates and take the medical advice seriously (distancing, washing hands, etc). 

But trust me, do NOT be watching the news 24/7, googling it all the time and scrolling World News subreddit constantly for updates. **This will destroy your mental health.**

People who don't have anxiety are panicking, so what the hell do you think those with anxiety will behave like?

It's not worth it. I haven't watched the news in 2 days and I've now put several subreddits on block. Honestly my anxiety is WAY less! It really does make a difference.
