VIRIDIANA: Let me pass!
DON JAIME: You must listen to me before you go.
VIRIDIANA: I've listened to you long enough. Let me out.
DON JAIME: All that I said just now was a lie. I said it so you wouldn't leave. I only molested you in my thoughts ... I can't bear to have you leave me, hating me like this. Tell me you believe what I'm saying and I'll let you go.
VIRIDIANA: You disgust me... even if what you say is true.
DON JAIME: Then you won't forgive me?
DON JAIME: You believe me, don't you?
RAMONA: Yes, sir.
DON JAIME: Don't lie. You don't believe me either.
RAMONA: It's only that ... It's all very odd, sir.
