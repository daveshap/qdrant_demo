Giving up on dating apps and using my dog instead!
So I just can’t get on with dating apps. My work is 99% males so no chance of meeting someone there. I’m a bit of an introvert and don’t socialise much. I spend a lot of time walking my dog. 
So I’ve decided to teach my boy a command (who’s that) and then he goes up to that person to say hello!
This is my new way to try and meet and talk to people who look interesting!
