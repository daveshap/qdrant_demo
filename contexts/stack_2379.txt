How do I optimise expedition and gym output? I noticed that when assigning spirits to an expedition, gym, or dojo, apart from the basic level/rarity/type information on each spirit, some of them have an upward red arrow icon while others have a downward blue arrow icon or no icon at all. You can even sort spirits by \"condition\so I'm gonna call it exactly that. My question is: how to choose the best spirits for each task?In my opinion, each of those four stats (level/rarity/type/condition) might contribute to the spirit effectiveness, but I want to know to what degree. So my question is twofold:What does this \"condition\" mean, how is it calculated, and how does that affect expedition rewards (or gym effectiveness)?How does level/rarity/type affect expedition rewards and gym effectiveness?
