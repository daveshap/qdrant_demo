MICKEY: Yeah?
CAESAR: Hey, Mickey.
VIOLET: Oh, God.
MICKEY: Caesar? What the fuck time is it?
CAESAR: Mick, I know it's late, but there is a problem. They haven't shown up yet.
MICKEY: What? They ain't there?
CAESAR: No. I don't know where they are. I even called over at Johnnie's, but no answer.
MICKEY: Okay. Let me call around. I'll see what I can do. Don't go anywhere, okay?
CAESAR: Okay, sure, Mick.
MICKEY: Caesar, you still got the money?
CAESAR: Yeah, Mick. I've got the money. I'm staring right at it.
MICKEY: Good. Sit tight. I'll call you.
