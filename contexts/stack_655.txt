Install 17.10 on 32 bit machine The new 17.10 only has 64 bit ISOs. However 32 bit is still supported, there just are no live ISOs for it.I have a 32 bit machine with WIFI, and I need to install from a USB disk. I tried the \"mini.iso\" but it doesn't have WIFI support.What options do I have?(PS I don't want another distro, and I can't use ethernet for installation, must be WIFI).
