WALDMAN: I'm quite serious. Look at all the charity and clinic work we do. Up until thirty years ago, the concept of vaccine was unheard of.
HENRY: You're saying all disease will eventually be eradicated?
WALDMAN: I'm convinced. Not by treating symptoms, but by diving nature's most jealously-guarded secrets.
HENRY: Do you foresee this happening in our lifetimes?
WALDMAN: No. But someday.
HENRY: Thank goodness. We'd be out of work.
VICTOR: Only you would think of that!
HENRY: Somebody has to!
VICTOR: I tell you what we need, my friends. Forget the symptoms and diseases. What we need is a vaccine for death itself.
WALDMAN: Oh, now you have gone too far. There's only one God, Victor.
HENRY: And here's to Him. Everything in moderation, Frankenstein.
VICTOR: Nothing in moderation, Clerval.
