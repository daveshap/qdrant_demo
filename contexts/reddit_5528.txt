I work as a stand up forklift driver, are there any better paying jobs this experience would help me get?
I've previously had retail/stocking jobs, this is in a warehouse with a stand up forklift, I'm on it for the entire day only getting off to put boxes on pallets. I get paid a little under $14 and this is probably the closest thing to a "real" job I've had, just wondering if there is anything I could segway this job into if I find this pretty easy/moderately enjoyable. I've tried the whole saving money and learning "skills" online thing, it does not work for me I don't wanna be a programmer. 

I think this still might be dead end since it's too disconnected from cranes/higher paid machinery, but thought it might be worth bouncing off of reddit if anyone has any suggestions, I'm definitely don't want to be management.
