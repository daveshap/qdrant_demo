Girls ends it with me after I bring up concerns over her never offering to pay
Did I dodge a bullet here?

I went on 3 dates with a girl who never once offered to pay for anything. I kind of gave her a pass on the first 2 since she drove 25 minutes ( I paid her to park since there is no street parking) to come see me and we always had a great time. I absolutely would not have let her pay but I still think she should have at least made an offer, but I was not too worried about it. On the third date, we went somewhere closer to her that she picked. We agreed on just drinks but shortly before the date, she told me she was hungry and she ended up ordering food while I ate dinner beforehand but got something small so she didn't feel weird.

We had a great time again but does not offer to contribute and then a few minutes later makes a comment about how I don't pay for her ubers to and from dates, while other guys she had gone out with did. She claims it was a joke but the timing was pretty poor so I was annoyed and the date ended pretty awkwardly shortly after.

The next day I let her know that I was pretty insulted by her comment because it's important to me that a girl offers to at least do something as little as pay for a round of drinks over the course of 3 dates, so to make a comment like that really hit a nerve. I told her I would not have even let her pay at this point, but the offer is a nice gesture that goes a long way with me and is very reassuring to me that Iâ€™m not being used as a meal ticket.

She then basically says "I'm sorry you feel that way about me offering to buy a round of drinks but I don't really have much else to say" and also makes a comment about this situation being immature and tells me that she'd like to end things. 

I'm pretty bummed because we connected really well and I was extremely attracted to her. But at the same time, I feel like I also dodged a bullet.
