(advice from an exec. recruiter) Curious why you aren't being called back after an interview?
I've worked in recruiting for many years, representing companies ranging from small tech start ups to fortune 25's.  Here are 3 reasons you'd never guess, that are keeping you from being advanced to the next interview.

1)  **You asked lame questions.**  Interviewers learn more about you *NOT* from the way you answer their questions, but from the questions you ask them.  Make them think.  Stump them.  Demonstrate you know everything there is to know about their co & what they do, through the questions you ask.  Make them fall in love with you through a single ?

2)  **You cared more about impressing them than uncovering their greatest need.**  You primped & polished, brought your heavy brag book and card stock resume, but you completely missed the mark on the fact that they are losing sleep because this vacant territory is losing 15k/day because someone's not there hustling.   

3)  **You were all arm and no follow through.**  You sent a canned email "Dear Interviewer, thank you for your time today.  I look forward to hearing more about the next steps."  Very, very, very few job seekers understand the critical importance of a proper follow up.  It is just as important as the interview itself.  I've had more clients than I can count, dismiss a candidate for either not following up at all, or sending a lame email.  Make it count.  Every jot & tittle.
