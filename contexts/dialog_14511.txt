QUINT: Hey, Squirt! You want to stow this gear or you want me to use it for ballast? It ain't good for much but bait.
HOOPER: I'll see ya. Tell Dorothy hello.
QUINT: Hello, Junior. What are you? Some kind of half-assed astronaut? Jesus Christ, when I was a kid, every little squirt wanted to be a harpooner or a sword fisherman. What d'ya have there -- a portable shower?
HOOPER: Anti-Shark cage.
QUINT: Who's inside, you or the shark?
