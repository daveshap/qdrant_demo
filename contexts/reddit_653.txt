Moving out young
Okay so I want to move out of my house as soon as I’m 18 but I’m not too sure where to start. For those reddit users that moved out young if any can you give me any tips or advice as to what to start with this is really important to me thank you. I also have a buddy or 2 that may want to join me as well because obviously I can’t do this alone and I’m also 17 about to graduate soon as well as I turn 18
