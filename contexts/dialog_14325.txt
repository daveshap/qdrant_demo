JACKIE: How long you been with Ordell?
MELANIE: This time? Almost a year. I've known him forever.
JACKIE: What were you two fighting about?
MELANIE: He told me to go outside. You may leave us now." It's all part of his pathetic attempt to be "the man." You know Mr. Walker don't you?"
MELANIE: Mr. Walker's my buddy. Ask him about Ordell.
JACKIE: That coke was yours, wasn't it?
