Big ol Meeting coming up
I work for a fairly large company as a contractor. We just acquired a new IT executive (not new to the company) in March/April. He has had a 'Team Connect' in March and late last night a new Town Hall meeting was scheduled for just contractors.   


I'm a little nervous. Mind you a previous company I worked for also did Town Hall's but it was always employee only. My director was also suprised by this Town Hall, they didn't know about it until a teammate brought it up.   


So, while I'm sure its just a normal Town Hall, I'm nervous.


UPDATE: well, found out why it was semi weird and secretive. Long story short, they only invited about 25% of there contractors because we are the core of what will be supporting the company going forward. So that's good :D
