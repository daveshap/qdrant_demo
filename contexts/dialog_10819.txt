VENKMAN: Be careful on that sofa -- it's a butt-biter. But the bed's good and I just changed the sheets so if you get tired, feel free. In fact, I think you should definitely plan on spending the night here.
DANA: Really? And how would we handle the sleeping arrangements?
VENKMAN: For me it's best if I sleep on my side and you spoon up right behind me with your arms around me. If we go the other way I'm afraid your hair will be getting in my face all night.
DANA: How about you on the sofa and me in bed with the baby.
VENKMAN: Or we could do that.
DANA: Thank you. Poor baby. I think I should put him down now.
VENKMAN: I'll put him down for you. You are way too short! And your belly-button sticks out! You're nothing but a burden to your poor mother!
VENKMAN: Did you find anything at Dana's?
STANTZ: Nothing. Just some mood-slime residue in and around the bathtub. But we did turn up some interesting stuff on this Vigo character you mentioned. I found the name Vigo the Carpathian in Leon Zundinger's Magicians, Martyrs and Madmen. Listen to this:
SPENGLER: Vigo the Carpathian
VENKMAN: A hundred and five years? He really hung on, didn't he.
STANTZ: And he didn't die of old age either. He was poisoned, stabbed, shot, hung, stretched, disemboweled, drawn and quartered.
WINSTON: I guess he wasn't too popular at the end there.
SPENGLER: No, not exactly a man of the people. Also known as Vigo the Cruel
STANTZ: This guy was a bad monkey. He dabbled in all the Black Arts, and listen to this prophecy. Just before his head died, his last words were, Death is but a door
VENKMAN: That's it? I'll be back?""
SPENGLER: It's a rough translation from the Moldavian.
