I’m worried about working 50 Hours/Week and going to Grad School. Has anyone experienced something similar and can give me tips on how to get through it?
I just got a great new job that starts in three weeks that pays really well. The problem is that they told me it would be a 50 hour/week job and I’m also taking two classes in Grad School. I’m worried about how I’m going to survive the stress of the extra workload of my new job along with the intensity of my coursework. 
Can someone give me some guidance of how they got through their similar experience, or just some tips on how to balance everything?
