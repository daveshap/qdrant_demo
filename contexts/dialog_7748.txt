GROUCHO: Gloria -- may I call you Gloria?
MRS. TEASDALE: Why -- why -- of course.
GROUCHO: You can call me Gloria too. Gloria -- what a beautiful name. When I was born my mother named me Gloria -- two minutes later she found out her mistake...
BOB: Father...
GROUCHO: Take a letter...
BOB: Who to?
GROUCHO: None of your business... Take another letter.
GROUCHO: Eureka Ammunition Company -- Gentlemen -- Your shipment of sailor hats arrived this morning by freight -- Gloria, I could go for you in a big way -- However, the rifles you sent were a little rusty -- -- and I don't say that to everybody -- Have not received last month's drawing account. How come? Your neck is like a swan... Yours very truly. Now read it back.
BOB: Eureka Ammunition Company, Gentlemen. Your shipment of sailor hats arrived this morning by freight. Gloria, I could go for you in a big way. However, the rifles you sent were a little rusty and I don't say that to everybody. Have not received last month's drawing account; how come your neck is like a swan. Yours very truly...
GROUCHO: They'll know I mean business then they get that letter... see that that gets out immediately and that goes for you too.
BOB: Yes, sir.
GROUCHO: Gloria, much as I hate to leave, I'd be crazy to stay here.
