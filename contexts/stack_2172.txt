Is there a fix for Skyrim's bug for Glory of the Dead? I recently got Skyrim Complete edition, the one with all the add-ons. I have it installed on my hard drive for Xbox360. I have many quests open, but the one I can't do is the Companions mission - Glory of the Dead.I started the mission before, to kill the witches at the coven and get the heads. I have all the witches heads with me. I got back to Whiterun and saw Kodlak was dead. I then proceeded to the Silver Hand fort and wiped them all out. I then fast travelled back to Whiterun, where Vilkas said that the funeral will start and I must go to the Skyforge. I then proceeded up to the Skyforge, where Aela starts talking. They light Kodlaks body on fire, and that's it. Nothing. There was something said about the underforge, but the quest marker did not point there. It still says Attend Kodlak's funeral.Now every time I go to Whiterun, the Skyforge has all the people there (the Jarl and steward, some villagers, and the companions) but they all just stand there. Vilkas, Farkas and Aela are all there. But the person not there is Eourland Grey-mane. I know he is needed, because you must give him the fragments of Wuurstal.I have done more quests after this bug, even built a house by Lakeview. But every time I go to Whiterun the people just stand there, the pyre burning and nothing happens. I have gone to the stables and entered by foot. I have uninstalled the game and run it from disc. I have waited till evening and morning. I have slept. Waited there. Gone about my business. Even went back to the witches coven and the Silver Hand places. I just killed one lonely Silver Hand guy outside the fort, but nothing changed when I got to Whiterun.Please has anybody solved this glitch for Xbox360? I want this mission done, so I can talk to those just standing there and continue the game, because I read that the Jarl is needed in order to progress the main quest-line
