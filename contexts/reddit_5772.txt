Anyone feel out of loop In life with their career goals or too old to get into anything ?
I’m 29 and meet people my age who are well into their careers they have the house the promotion the kids and I look at myself and think wow what have I been doing with my life seriously!! It’s depressing and angering to be honest how little iv respected myself and let myself fall out of loop with society.
