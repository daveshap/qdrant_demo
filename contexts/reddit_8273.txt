What would have happened to someone in Jimmy Kimmel's situation under the current version of the AHCA?
Jimmy Kimmel recently described his experience having a child born with congenital defects and expressed his gratitude for the ACA in the process. See [here](http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/02/entertainment/jimmy-kimmel-baby-surgery/) for example.

This raises the question of how things would have gone differently for someone in the same situation under the proposed AHCA. See [here](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1628) and also consider the recent proposed changes to coverage of preexisting conditions.

Of course, he's rich and would have been fine either way. What would the outcome be for a poorer family in the same situation without health insurance? What about a family with health insurance? A family with preexisting conditions before the pregnancy? A family with high-deductible coverage? Etc.

What are the major differences between how this situation would unfold under AHCA versus ACA?

I understand that some of these outcomes depend on the state the family lives in and whether that state opts out of the preexisting conditions coverage clause.
