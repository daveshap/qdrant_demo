BOBBY: Hey.
DARRELL: Hey, your ... what the hell happened to you?
BOBBY: Nothing.
DARRELL: Don't look like nothing.
BOBBY: Just banged my head. It was an accident.
DARRELL: Another accident? You got to be more careful.
BOBBY: What the hell happened to my car?
DARRELL: Bottom hose was shot too. Rotted clear through. Had to put a new one in. Runs like a dream now.
DARRELL: Well ... you got your parts, you got your labour ... let's call it a hundred-fifty bucks.
BOBBY: How much!?
DARRELL: Hundred-fifty.
BOBBY: To replace a goddamn radiator hose!?
DARRELL: A goddamn radiator hose in a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang. You know how long it took me to find that hose?
BOBBY: About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer I've been gone.
DARRELL: Actually, it's been about three hours. You're the one thinks that car's so damn fancy. What you expect but fancy damn prices?
BOBBY: That's a Ford, not a Ferrari. You going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford?
DARRELL: That's not just a Ford
BOBBY: What's that got to do with the radiator hose?
DARRELL: I don't know, but it's the reason I'm living here and you're just passing through." Now you owe me a hundred-fifty dollars."
BOBBY: It might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars, because I don't have the money.
DARRELL: Then you ain't gonna have the car.
BOBBY: Listen, man. I got rolled half an hour ago for everything I had.
