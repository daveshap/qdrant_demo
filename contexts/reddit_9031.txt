What are legislative alternatives to the current practice of Gerrymandering in the US? What pros (if any) argue that no policy change is needed?
**ger·ry·man·der**
verb *ˈjerēˌmandər* ***manipulate the boundaries of (an electoral constituency) so as to favor one party or class.***


Here is an old CGP Grey video on it for those who aren't familiar.  This video helps get an intuitive grasp of simple forms of gerrymandering:

Gerrymandering is a common action in the US today and results in entrenched districts being created.  Groups like FairVote, and others have cited this is a cause for concern.

Some sources claim that gerrymandering does not reduce the effectiveness of local representation (in terms of obtaining local funding), although it can skew party representation:

A summary of alternatives (as well as a discussion of the broad unpopularity of the current system) is discussed here:  https://news.virginia.edu/content/citizens-don-t-gerrymandering-study-offers-alternative-redistricting-methods

Should this be a legislative focus to fix, and if so, how should it be done?  Are the efforts in California and Iowa (described in the previous link) a good approach?

This may not be politically tenable, given that many reports claim that Republican majorities in the House stem directly from gerrymandering efforts over the last decades.

And some Democrats also use this technique to make stable seats such as in Chicago:

Is it really pushing out the centrist candidates, as claimed in this article?
