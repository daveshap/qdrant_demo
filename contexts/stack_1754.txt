Multiple slaves with identical address on multi-master I2C bus I'm planning a hardware design, where I have a main board and multiple peripheral boards. On each of these boards is a microcontroller with I2C, which is the communication bus for the boards. The same kind of a peripheral board can be attached multiple times to the bus.The microcontroller (will be an ARM, not specified yet) supports dual address. My idea now is, to set one address to an unique address (with switches for example) and the second to a \"group\" address, which will be the same for one kind of peripheral.Is it possible to send commands from my main board to the peripheral, as long it doesn't need a \"read back\" (only master -> slave)?For me, it looks like the same functionality as for the general call with address 0x00 except it allows me to make \"grouped\" general call. But I don't know for sure, if this will work.
