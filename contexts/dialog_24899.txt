BUZZ: Theo, I want you to get out of this town.
THEO: I'm getting to like it here.
BUZZ: Did that porcupine say he'd get you back on the tour?
THEO: I gotta survive.
BUZZ: He'll be a barnacle on your ass the rest of your life.
THEO: You got a better offer?
BUZZ: No...
THEO: I didn't think so.
BUZZ: Not for somebody who hit a man with his ball on national television.
THEO: That's right, Buzz, and you know when I did it? Last match, last frame. All I needed was one spare for the crown - and I get stuck with the seven-ten, the Fazeli Split.
BUZZ: You never even took the shot. You couldn't do it. Theo moves towards Buzz in a threatening manner.
THEO: I was beaten on a shot named after my own dad. The moment passes. Theo turns and climbs into his car. He looks up at Buzz.
BUZZ: Look, kid, gimme a break. I'm an old man. I'm runnin' on a Delrin aorta. I'm finished - dead from my ankles up.
THEO: I couldn't care less.
