Is this unprofessional?
Hi everyone! I recently applied to a job at my alma mater which I am extremely excited about. The job doesn't close for another 9 days and then of course there is the wait time while they review applications. Is it inappropriate of me to email the head of the department the job is in just to express my interest and excitement about this job opportunity? I keep going back and forth about it, so I figured I would ask for your advice. Thank you!
