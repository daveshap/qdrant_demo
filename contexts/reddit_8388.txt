Why are Green Parties consistently anti-nuclear?
I've been reading up on the Green movement and I've noticed that registered Green Parties around the world hold consistent anti-nuclear stances.  This is regardless of a country's economic development level.


I understand that Green Parties have their own Political International organisation, the [Global Greens](https://www.globalgreens.org/) with their own [charter](https://www.globalgreens.org/globalcharter).  In the charter, of course is the pledge to phase out nuclear power.


Any Green political party with any influence (whether it is from the U.K, Taiwan or Brazil) is a member of the global Greens movement and holds the same beliefs and policies with little deviation.


However, it doesn't really explain why the stance on nuclear power is such a core tenet of Green politics though.

&nbsp;

So there's really a few questions:

&nbsp;

Why is the anti-nuclear movement so strongly correlated with Green political parties to the point that there's no notable Green/pro-environmental Parties that have a different stance on nuclear power?

Is it because an anti-nuclear stance is a law of nature for pro-environmental groups?  Or is it simply the consequence that coalition/consensus building must inevitably involve anti-nuclear issues?  Because this trend is remarkably consistent.

&nbsp;

Is there any exceptions to this rule?
