I am absolutely terrified I will fail my master's degree.
I'm taking a master's of economics and it is *hard*. I'm studying 2-3 hours every single day, and I still don't think that's enough. I just can't take it all in. I have a mid term in 7 days, and another in 9 days. I just don't know how I'm going to do it. I'm slowly starting to understand the material, but then I look at the potential exam questions and I feel like I'm just fucked. I really need this too. I can't fail.
