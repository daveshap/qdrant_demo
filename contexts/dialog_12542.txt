BERNIE: You <u>woulda</u> gone in there, you wouldn'ta thought twice... Trust me on that, that's the kinda guy you are. For a guy like me, it's a momentary loss of sanity. I wasn't thinking clearly.

DEAKINS: She can't quit.
EVELYN: My God! It... it <u>is</u> him!
JOEY: Wh-why's he... why's he up there, mom?
