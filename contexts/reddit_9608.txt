Higher Education Job Search Stories
Given that we're entering the peak hiring time, and a lot of the soon to be new grads are going to various hiring conferences (i.e. TPE, OPE, etc) and actively searching, I figured it would be fun for people to share some of their craziest/funniest/weirdest job search or interview stories. I'm going through a particularly brutal job search right now (I've been applying for about a year), so my selfish reasons for this is that hopefully it will cheer me up...?

Can be from either side of the interview table (either as the job searcher or the search committee)! (Also probably for the best that we use pseudonyms in place of real office/institution names)
