For anyone with depression, anxiety, low self esteem who struggles everyday...
I want you to know you are not alone. I think about suicide a few times a day. I don't have a tight knit friend group, just one-on-one relationships. I have trouble connecting with people as I am always worried what they think. I am overemotional, sensitive and have very low self esteem. Although I feel like giving up... alot. I do not want to. I do not want to harm myself and let the last thing I do hurt everyone that loves me. Life isn't about being perfectly happy all the time. Let the pain rush over you and do not fight it. Once you allow yourself to feel it, you will begin to heal. Fear and paranoia consume my life. I watch others live in peace jealously, but every once in a while I realize they struggle too. Find something that makes you happy and do it. Don't compare yourself (as much as you can) Sending you love and support.
