\"Please confirm receipt of this email\" or \"Please confirm the receipt of this email\"? So, Gmail now is intelligent: it guesses what one wants to write and suggests it in advance! One thing it suggests is: <blockquote>  Please confirm receipt of this email.</blockquote>But shouldn't it be:<blockquote>  Please confirm the receipt of this email.</blockquote>And correspondingly,<blockquote>  Please confirm receipt.</blockquote>or <blockquote>  Please confirm the receipt.</blockquote>Which one is correct/better? To write it with \"the\" seems to me more natural.
