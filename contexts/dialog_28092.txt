LOMBARD: May I...?
MRS SPITZ: May I ask if you are Jewish, Mr Lombard?
MRS SPITZ: Lombard, this is not a Jewish name, is it?
LOMBARD: I hope it’s not too significant.
MRS SPITZ: What if it is?
LOMBARD: Well, I would have to point out that we could have dealt with that question when you called this morning, Mrs Spitz. I wouldn’t like to think I’d kept you waiting for nothing.
MRS SPITZ: Whatever, you come recommended. We...
LOMBARD: Recommended?
MRS SPITZ: Must I speak to you in French?
LOMBARD: Didn’t you say I came recommended? That’s what I thought. May I know by whom?
MRS SPITZ: You may not. And besides, it is irrelevant.
LOMBARD: Okay. Recommended...
MRS SPITZ: Good. Now, as I trust you may have guessed, we are looking for someone to work for us. Someone whose discretion can be relied upon. Someone who while in our employ would give us full commitment. Do you think you could be that person, Mr Lombard?
LOMBARD: Look Mrs Spitz... I don’t know to whom I’m indebted for the recommendation but... I’m not in the business of making oaths of allegiance or giving myself character references. What I do is listen to what the people who care to call me have to say and judge whether or not I can be of help. I hope you can appreciate that, Mrs Spitz.
MRS SPITZ: What I can appreciate is insolence, Mr Lombard!
