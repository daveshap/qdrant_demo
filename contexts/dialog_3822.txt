WHISTLER: Tell me something, Skid --
SCUD: Scud.
WHISTLER: Whatever -- What'd you do to the Charger?
SCUD: The pimp-mobile? Just made a few after market modifications. Nitrous-oxide injection system, forged aluminum pistons and crankshaft, higher flowing fuel pump.
WHISTLER: Gave it a more aggressive exhaust profile ramping.
SCUD: Fuck yeah. Whole package'll crank this betty up another three-hundred horsepower.
WHISTLER: And you'll burn the damn thing out before your next fucking oil change.
WHISTLER: Where'd you dig up this shit-bird anyway?
SCUD: Look, what's your problem?
