LEE: Are you okay?
CARTER: What's the first thing I told you -- never trust nobody. How could you fall for that shit? I knew she was dirty.
LEE: She saved our lives.
CARTER: For how long? Face it, Lee, she's playing both sides.
CARTER: Look, man I'm sorry. I know you got a thing for her.
LEE: Shhh, my head hurts.
CARTER: I'm about to be killed and you Shhh" me! This wasn't my case
LEE: Why did you help me?
CARTER: It doesn't matter.
LEE: I'm not used to having a partner.
CARTER: We are not partners. Between your daddy, my daddy, and the beating I just took, as far as I can tell all partners get you is dead.
LEE: Well we're not friends.
CARTER: You got that right. And we ain't brothers. Maybe we should just end this right here.
LEE: Fine with me.
CARTER: I won't talk to you, you don't talk to me. We'll die in peace.
LEE: See you in the next world.
CARTER: I don't believe in reincarnation. So I won't see you in the next world.
LEE: Fine.
CARTER: I believe in heaven. You people believe in heaven?
LEE: Yes. We have heaven.
CARTER: Is it the same heaven, or is it a Chinese heaven?
LEE: What's a Chinese heaven?
CARTER: I thought it might be like those five foot and under basketball leagues. They don't let everybody in.
LEE: I think we should stop talking.
CARTER: Fine by me.
CARTER: You thinking about that girl that dumped you?
LEE: No.
CARTER: If she was the right girl, you'd be thinking about her.
LEE: Mind your own business.
CARTER: How was the sex?
LEE: There was no sex. She was very traditional. We were waiting until we were married.
CARTER: You're kidding. No sex? Nothing? No mu-shu?
LEE: No mu-shu.
CARTER: What about a little king pao chicken?
LEE: No kung pao chicken. Never.
CARTER: Steamed dumplings?
LEE: Once in a while, steamed dumplings. But only when she was drunk.
CARTER: That's rough, man. If I don't get steamed dumplings once a week, I go crazy.
LEE: Tell me the truth, Carter. Do you think I have a good voice?
CARTER: Are you serious?
LEE: Forget it. It doesn't matter.
CARTER: As long as you're asking...I think you have a pretty good voice.
LEE: I knew it. What does she know. You want me to sing something?
CARTER: That depends. How do the Fu-Cang-Long usually kill their victims?
LEE: They'll probably torture us first, shock our privates, then put two bullets in our eyes and one in the back of the head.
CARTER: Go ahead. Sing your ass off.
