Any tips
So I really want to pursue my masters in Student Affairs, but im really struggling to write an interest statement with professional goals. I feel like im over thinking it, but I may not be. Im super interested in the motivation and human behavior/development at the collegiate level and also looking at the various ways we communicate with each other and students. 

I soent 2 years working in housing (not as an RA though) and I learned a lot about the two above concepts honestly just from observing and interacting. I just dont know how to get it on paper. 


I really need to get it down though because one of my letters of rec wont write it until she reads this statement (even though shes had me for 2 years as a student)
