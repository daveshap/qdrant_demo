International Grad to the US
Hello! I was accepted to a grad school doctoral program in NY State, but have not received notification of an assistantship. I'm worried that I won't get one, and I won't be able to afford tuition (for I-20 purposes, I'd need to show I have the full amount in my account - I don't). 

I'm hoping to start in Fall 2020.

I realise time is not on my side, and this is likely a stupid question, but can anyone recommend good resources for grad school funding?
