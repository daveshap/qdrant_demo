MISS OLSEN: Hi. How's the branch manager from Kansas City?
FRAN: I beg your pardon? MISS OLSEN I'm Miss Olsen -- Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.
FRAN: Yes, I know.
MISS OLSEN: So you don't have to play innocent with me. He used to tell his wife that I was the branch manager from Seattle -- four years ago when we were having a little ring-a-ding- ding.
FRAN: I don't know what you're talking about.
MISS OLSEN: And before me there was Miss Rossi in Auditing -- and after me there was Miss Koch in Disability -- and just before you there was Miss What's-Her-Name, on the twenty- fifth floor --
FRAN: Will you excuse me?
MISS OLSEN: What for? You haven't done anything -- it's him -- what a salesman -- always the last booth in the Chinese restaurant -- and the same pitch about divorcing his wife -- and in the end you wind up with egg foo yong on your face.
