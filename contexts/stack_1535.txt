Why does a MOSFET enter saturation? From all my browsing, it has become clear that as drain-source voltage increases, we eventually reach saturation. Mathematically, Vds>Vgs-Vt is the condition we look at.But when I try to understand it logically, we need a reverse bias at Vgs to attract minority carriers from substrate to form a channel. So now that the channel is formed, a drain source voltage gives rise to a current flow due to electrons. It also makes sense that Vds should produce a depletion region at one of source/drain and reduce depletion region.But how would all this relate to channel widths, saturation and everything else that gives rise to saturation?
