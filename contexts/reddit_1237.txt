Im tired of people saying there has to be a reason why I'm anxious.
Can I not wake up anxious or it suddenly come on? People act like "oh you're fine" if you have no specific reason for the anxiety. I have generalized anxiety disorder and binge eating disorder. I can't help it sometimes and when I talk to someone about it, they brush it off like it's not a big deal because I can't figure out why I'm anxious. 

I woke up wanting to eat my whole fridge today. Is there really a giant reason? No. People say "just eat then". They don't understand that if I do right now, idk if I can stop myself. You know? It goes with OCD too. You can't stop thinking about it until you act on the obsession.

Sorry for that rant. If anyone would like to talk about it, I'd be happy to possibly make some new friends!
