RANON: Dada, what's a daikini?
WILLOW: Daikinis are giant people who live far far away.
RANON: Are you scared?
RANON: I could be you rguard! I could carry your spear!
WILLOW: What a great son you are, Ranon. I wish I could take you with me. Now go to sleep...
HIGH ALDWIN: Now, you know where you're going? Down there, through those trees, follow the river. You'll know the crossroads by a big daikini struc- ture. Willow, this is serious business. Don't waste any time, the outer world is no place for a Nelwyn. Give the baby to the first daikini you see, then hurry home as fast as you can.
WILLOW: If I'm not strong enough to be your apprentice, how can I do this?
HIGH ALDWIN: You're strong enough. But you're going to need courage, Willow.
WILLOW: I don't want courage. I don't want to be a warrior. All I've ever wanted was to do magic, real magic, like you!
HIGH ALDWIN: Real magic, Willow, is simply the art of controlling the reality of others. You lack faith in your- self. You must learn to trust your intuition.
HIGH ALDWIN: Go in the direction the bird is flying.
WILLOW: Oh, if I could do that I'd--I'd turn Burglekutt into a toad!
HIGH ALDWIN: Waste magic on revenge? You have much to learn, Willow...
