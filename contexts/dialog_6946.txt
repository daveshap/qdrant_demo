FRIDA: I have cramps. I can't believe I let you talk me into this.
JENNIFER: Come on, we've been double dating since the fourth grade.
FRIDA: Yeah even then look what happened: Michael Mortenson kissed you and Billy Sullivan threw a worm at me.
JENNIFER: Well that's not going to happen tonight. George said Carlton's a nice guy.
FRIDA: Translation: a total geek.
JENNIFER: Anything's better than Mark.
FRIDA: My shrink says he's not so bad.
JENNIFER: Your shrink always gives you bad advice. He only hears what you choose to tell him. Mark's an asshole, he cheated, he borrowed money and never paid it back, he's never had a regular job.
FRIDA: He's a very talented musician.
JENNIFER: Every woman at some point has to date a musician. I wish you'd get rid of Mark for good. Every time you break up you see him more than when you were going out.
FRIDA: I guess I have a weakness for him. It's those big brown Bambi eyes.
JENNIFER: So don't look in his eyes.
