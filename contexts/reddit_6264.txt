Accepted a job offer, but no start date yet.
I accepted a job offer, signed an offer letter, but said the start date is contingent upon passing drug screening and background check. I last called the recruiter to ask the status of my background check and was supposedly cleared July 3rd. The company has been radio silent since then, should I keep trying to bug HR? I'm super anxious if the job even exists still.

Edit: Sorry forgot to include, I was verbally told my starting date would be July 8th, but I called on the 5th to see if I could see if I can officially start and the recruiter said not officially yet. So I'm at a bit of a loss as to what to do now.
