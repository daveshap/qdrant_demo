MACREADY: Would that test have worked?
DR. COPPER: I think so.
NORRIS: Somebody else sure as hell thought so.
MACREADY: Who else could have used that key?
GARRY: Ah... no one... I give it to Copper when he needs it...
MACREADY: Could anyone have gotten it from you?
DR. COPPER: I don't see how... when I'm finished I return it right away.
NORRIS: When was the last time you used it?
DR. COPPER: A day or so ago... I guess.
GARRY: I suppose... well, it's possible someone might have lifted it from me. But...
CHILDS: That key ring of yours is always hooked to your belt. Now how could somebody get to it without you knowing?
GARRY: Look, I haven't been near that... that refrigerator.
