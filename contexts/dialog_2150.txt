CHRIS: I thought you were gonna throw these?
DOUG: I had a better idea, we'll burn them. There's a drum across the road; I was just waiting for the workers to go home.
CHRIS: Destroy the evidence huh.
DOUG: Have you ever stolen anything?
CHRIS: Nope.
DOUG: Could you handle it if it was in a good cause?
CHRIS: Like helping a sick kid?
DOUG: No, for the Asylum.
CHRIS: Close!
DOUG: Just aiding and abetting if it makes you feel better.
CHRIS: What's that, five instead of ten years jail.
DOUG: They'll never get us.
