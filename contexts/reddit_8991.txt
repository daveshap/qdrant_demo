[META] How are we doing?
Dear users,

In the first three months of this year, we experienced an explosion of growth in both subscribers and traffic. With the influx of new users came multiple complaints to the mods, so we decided to take action by temporarily [shutting down the sub and then relaunching](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/4cxx7m/meta_rneutralpolitics_is_going_into_lockdown_mode/) with more strict enforcement and an expanded mod team.

It's been five weeks now and overall feedback has been remarkably positive. But we want to hear from the general community, especially those of you who have been here a while.

How is /r/NeutralPolitics doing? What's working and what isn't? What can we improve?

Sincerely,

â€” /r/NeutralPolitics mod team
