Is it possible for ssh app on Android to collect my credentials? I have a condition that I am far away from my laptop that I use to work. All I have is my Android Samsung J2. Sometimes I need to work remotely on my server, checking some stuff like traffic data, logs, and such. I try using putty on my Android. There are many ssh apps like putty for Android. Is it possible for the ssh apps to get my ssh user and password? Could the developer of that app collect credentials?
