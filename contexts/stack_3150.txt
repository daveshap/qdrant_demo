Does anybody remember the Star Wars Marvel comics between Star Wars and Empire Strikes Back? As far as I remember, it went on for 5-6 issues and was mostly taking place on a Waterworld-type all-water planet.  Blasters, skimmers, wooden ships.The funny, and somewhat creepy in hindsight bit, is that Luke and Leia were a couple.  Not entirely unexpected, there had been a bit of romantic vibes in the air between those 2 in the first movie.  Which Empire, of course, quickly switched over to Leia and Han.How did that romance see the light of day, considering their later-to-be-revealed sibling relationship?  Seems like not exercising enough control on your spinoff agreements and plot arcs.
