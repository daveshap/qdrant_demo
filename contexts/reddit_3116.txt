I didn't pass probation for my dream job. How should i reflect on this?
Hi all,

I didn't pass probation. It was an economist position. I'm new to the workforce, been working since graduation for ~11 months.

I feel some of it was my fault, but some of it was not. I did my best, and thought i was doing well. I could do things that others there couldn't do. I met deadlines (where they were given to me). I learnt R on the job, and in a month i could write complex geospatial analyses in R to help with evidence-building to work out effective consumer choice.

But around 3 months into the job it looks like (and only on the last day did i realise) management was assembling evidence to boot me out. A report was drafted and the managers agreed i should not pass probation.

Comments made to me were:

* Couldn't get a piece of R  work done on time (the code was done by another team member and malfunctioning. Worse still, another team member left it half done and didn't touch it for a month. I was effectively blamed for that.)
* Didn't understand a concept around a productivity measure (i did, but the data i relied on another organisation to give it to me was never there - so i tried alternative measures which didn't make sense)
* Inability to let things go (true - i kept thinking someone had a problem with me so i made sure i didn't do something wrong by accident)
* Asked too many questions (could have told me to stop, and would have)
* Attention to detail lacking sometimes (in the cases they raised, they said it was "fine"...ugh)

Some things said of me wasn't really true, so i think a part of it was that i didn't click with the team (esp. the managers).

But i don't care about blaming people. I care about making sure this never happens again. How do i reflect on this?

I have interviews lined up, and i'm actually in close contention for one position (they didn't get this employer's reference and accepted the reason i gave - which technically is not a lie). 

How can i be sure if i get a similar position, i don't fuck it up? I can't bear giving up on an economist career (at least for a while) after this failure, but is being an economist even right for me?

Help me reflect on this.
