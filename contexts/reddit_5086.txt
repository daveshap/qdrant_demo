Trying to curb hopelessness
Greetings /r/jobs, 

This is my first post here. I come to you seeking some advice. I suffer from depression, anxiety, all that... and, unfortunately for me, applying for jobs is not an exercise in positive mental health. I hate my current job; it keeps the lights on, but I am suffering from a lack of projects and severely limited potential. I just applied for one new position online, but, it just feels so hopeless. In 2019, I have received so many rejections - too numerous to mention. The self-doubt keeps creeping back no matter what I try to do. This is day 1 in what feels like an eternal struggle.

Thank you for reading my post. What else should I be doing?

Edit: I'm realizing that I'm trying to curb hopelessness assuming I will get rejected from the opportunity I applied for. This is the mindset I'm in. I would appreciate a discussion on this topic, as I am not the first person to suffer from these issues.
