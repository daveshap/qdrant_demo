TV Show About People Who Make Deals With The Devil I remember watching a show on Hulu (90% sure it was on Hulu, but when I checked a list of their original programming I couldn't find it) that involved people meeting with a supernatural figure that acted as a middleman between the people and God. I don't know if the figure was a demon or an angel. It might have been ambiguous. The middleman would give them a task in exchange for his help.  In one episode he told an old lady to build a bomb, and in another he told a man to surveil a kid. I believe the stories were also interconnected. When the old lady's bomb went off, I think the man was able to save the kid's life because he was close by watching. That's all I remember.
