HAWKEYE: I'm going to play poker until three a.m. or until the patient is ready for surgery. However, if you'd like to operate on him yourself right now, be my guest. I get the same dough whether I work or not.

HAWKEYE: There's nothing to talk about, General. You take the case yourself or join me at three o'clock. Either way you're liable to learn something.
