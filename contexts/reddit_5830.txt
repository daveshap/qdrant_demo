Seeking advice on if I should pursue an associates degree rather than a bachelors degree
I graduated with a bachelors degree in media studies in 2016.  Its been four years, and I've decided that I would like to pursue an education in computer programming.  I'm currently enrolled in an community college that has a transfer program to a university.

My question- is it really worth taking out student loans to get the bachelors degree at a university, when I can get an associates degree for much cheaper?  I understand that generally a bachelors degree looks prettier to employers.  My existing bachelors degree is in an unrelated field to most jobs I'll be applying for, but its a bachelors degree nonetheless.

Would having an associates degree on top of my bachelors really set me back in the job pool, or do you internet strangers recommend I accrue some good old fashioned debt for my education?
