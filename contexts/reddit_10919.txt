I'm actually excited about the corona virus and hope it kills me or changes life overall for the human race so my life isnt so fucking meaningless all the time.
I know no one here really cares about this and that's not a surprise. In today's society, everyone is so fucking selfish. Seriously, everyone either cares about money or clout or both. I don't have either of those and I do envy those who are spoiled. My life isn't bad at all and in fact I have many more advantages than most people my age, but I still feel like theres no purpose. I get a degree from university. So what? then I have to work a boring ass fucking office job for years 8 hours a day only having some time on the weekends for a few hours? What is the fucking point. I swear it feels like a fucking prision. The only thing I semi enjoy is gaming but you can't make a career out of it today. and yes, I KNOW IT IS POSSIBLE, BUT IT IS NOT PROBABLE.  so don't give me that shit about "just try" like fuck off. 

Overall I honestly feel like theres no purpose in life. Like when thinking about killing myself I try to remember to before I was born and what it was like and I realize I can't remember anything because I didn't exist. It was like a void. The same will happen when I kill myself. no pain just a state of nothingness that we as humans can't even comphrend.

I don't know how to be happy when it seems everyone is better than me, they have goals and are doing stuff. I have no goals. I have no ambitions and don't care what anyone else thinks. One day I will find a way to end it but not today because im too much of a pussy. fml. 

also sorry about the grammar im not gonna edit it cause im a lazy shit.
