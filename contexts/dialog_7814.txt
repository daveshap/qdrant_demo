HARRY: You're it.
LLOYD: Am not.
HARRY: Are, too.
LLOYD: D2.
HARRY: It's okay. I want the rush.
LLOYD: No. Look.
HARRY: Hey, it's Jessica.
LLOYD: That must be her boyfriend's car.
HARRY: PRINCIPAL COLLINS is her boyfriend!
LLOYD: Now it makes total sense why she didn't want him to know we were in his office the other night.
HARRY: No wonder we both struck out with her. Who can compete with the sexual power of the man who occupies the highest office in the land?
LLOYD: He's like the Pope. Like we're gonna snake a girl away from the Pope.
HARRY: Hey, let's go spy on them.
HARRY: Oh my god, are you alright?
CALE: Yeah, I think.
