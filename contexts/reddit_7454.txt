I am so burnt out
I am in nurse practitioner school and am about 20% done. I just finished my BSN in August and started my MSN 3 days later. I graduated with my ADN 3 days before starting my BSN. 

Right now I am starting my search for preceptors for next semester. It seems like it'll only get harder from here, but between been in school year round for the last 7 years, and being stuck in a toxic and unpredictable workplace, I just feel like I can't keep going. My brain is overwhelmed and exhausted. I don't have the energy to work out or do more than the bare minimum for school.

What have you guys done to keep going when you have felt this way?
