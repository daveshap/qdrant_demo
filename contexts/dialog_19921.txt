SPIKE: What's going on?
WILLIAM: I'm going to throw out these old videos.
SPIKE: No. You can't bin these. They're classics. I'm not allowing this.
WILLIAM: Right -- let's talk about rent...
SPIKE: Let me help. We don't want all this shit cluttering up our lives.
MARTIN: I have to disturb you when you're cooking the books, but there's a delivery.
WILLIAM: Martin, can't you just deal with this yourself?
MARTIN: But it's not for the shop. It's for you.
WILLIAM: Okay. Tell me, would I have to pay a wet rag as much as I pay you?
ANNA: Hi.
WILLIAM: Hello.
ANNA: You disappeared.
WILLIAM: Yes -- I'm sorry -- I had to leave... I didn't want to disturb you.
ANNA: Well... how have you been?
WILLIAM: Fine. Everything much the same. When they change the law Spike and I will marry immediately. Whereas you... I've watched in wonder. Awards, glory ...
ANNA: Oh no. It's all nonsense, believe me. I had no idea how much nonsense it all was -- but nonsense it all is... Well, yesterday was our last day filming and so I'm just off -- but I brought you this from home, and...
ANNA: I thought I'd give it to you.
WILLIAM: Thank you. Shall I...
ANNA: No, don't open it yet -- I'll be embarrassed.
WILLIAM: Okay -- well, thank you. I don't know what it's for. But thank you anyway.
ANNA: I actually had it in my apartment in New York and just thought you'd... but, when it came to it, I didn't know how to call you... having behaved so... badly, twice. So it's been just sitting in the hotel. But then... you came, so I figured... the thing is... the thing is ...
WILLIAM: What's the thing?
