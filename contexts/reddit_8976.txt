What States allow Joint-Administered Primaries and what are the Pros & Cons of having both parties share resources?
In Texas (and other states) many citizens faced [long lines](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/03/03/super-tuesday-long-lines-reported-polls-texas-california/4946817002/)
 resulting in polling places not closing [well past an additional three hours](https://www.texastribune.org/2020/03/03/texas-voting-lines-extend-hours-past-polls-closing-super-tuesday/). [Harris County Clerk Trautman confirmed](https://twitter.com/dtrautman/status/1235062013778223105?s=19) many polls remained unclosed hours after the cut-off. 

In light of this difficulty the [Harris County Clerk in Texas released a letter](

Some have cited recent initiatives such as [county-wide voting to blame](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/politics/houston/article/Sunrise-voters-set-the-pace-for-Super-Tuesday-in-15101191.php) for the lack of locations while allowing some locations to become packed while others have shorter lines. 

In addition, there were reports that polls [opened late](https://www.kxan.com/news/your-local-election-hq/technical-difficulties-staffing-shortages-creating-long-lines-on-election-day/), some volunteers choosing to stay home for various reasons including the [Coronavirus](https://www.kut.org/post/travis-county-poll-workers-coronavirus-fears-prompt-rocky-start-election-day)

- Knowing these other difficulties, Is there evidence to suggest that the structure of primary system itself plays a role in the wait times of voters?
- Per the letter's request is it typical for parties to share primary resources in other states? (All machines are available to all users). Many locations in Texas had  ["much longer lines for the Democratic primary than the Republican primary"](https://dailyjournalonline.com/news/national/govt-and-politics/the-latest-harris-county-blames-long-primary-lines-on-gop/article_26587263-373d-5523-83d2-097d0cdab25b.html) Republicans waited ["a fraction of the time"](https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/politics/some-voters-report-long-wait-lines-in-tarrant-county-on-super-tuesday/2323606/) because of the distribution of voting machines.
