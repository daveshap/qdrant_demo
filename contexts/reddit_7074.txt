Just started working for a domestic violence hotline, what should I exoect?
I'm not sure if I am posting this in the right subreddit so I do apologize in advance. I am working on the domestic violence hotline in Illinois, we don't get paid since it's more of volunteer work but I will be using this as a foot in the door for other job opportunities for me in the future. Does anyone here know a thing or two about working on a dv hotline? What to expect? How to react or what to say in certain situations? I did dv training and know how these relationships work I think I am just have first day jitters.
Edit: *facepalm* I spelt expect wrong in the title
