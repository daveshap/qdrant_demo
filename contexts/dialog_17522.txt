PARRISH: The Treasury Department asked my cooperation in his undercover investigation of John Bontecou. They were convinced that Bontecou, on past deals, had structured his mergers and acquisitions in sus- picious and complicated ways so as to evade paying the taxes he is liable for. The IRS wanted to go after him, and this deal offered them the opportunity. I agreed to cooperate.
JOE: And we're very grateful.
PARRISH: Moreover, Agent Joe Black here -- of course that's not his real name -- smelled out your involvement, Drew. He developed evidence you were working both sides of the fence. Unfortunately, that's known as a conflict of interest --
JOE: Undisclosed conflict of interest --
PARRISH: An offense --
JOE: An indictable offense.
DREW: I think I'd like to talk to my lawyer --
PARRISH: No lawyers, Drew. We're going to offer you a deal.
DREW: And what do I get?
PARRISH: You get not to go to jail.
DREW: You're talking through your hat. You're offering a deal because you've got no proof.
PARRISH: Proof? We've got plenty of proof.
