How do i get a job i have no experience in?
Need some help with planning my career. So I got a B.A. in psychology and I want to go into marketing. But, I have no marketing experience. What can I do to gain the experience and skills to land a good marketing position? Had anyone been in a similar position and what have you guys done about it. Any advice if appreciated.
