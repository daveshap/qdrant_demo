KENNY: Hello?
THE PRESIDENT: I've got to move. What do you have, Kenny?
KENNY: They know each other! Khruschev and Feklisov aka Fomin were war buddies!
THE PRESIDENT: You're sure...
KENNY: Don't take it to court, but we've got good circumstantial evidence... Walter agrees. My gut's telling me Khruschev's turning to a trusted old friend to carry his message.
THE PRESIDENT: Okay, Ken. We're going.
SCALI: I am instructed to tell you that the American Government would respond favorably to an offer along the lines you have discussed. If this solution were raised at the U.N. by Ambassador Zorin, he would find a favorable reply from Ambassador Stevenson.
FOMIN: So I understand you correctly. If the missiles in Cuba were dismantled, returned to the Soviet Union, and a guarantee was made not to reintroduce them, the United States would be prepared to guarantee that it would never invade Cuba?
SCALI: That is correct.
FOMIN: This is from the Highest Authority?
SCALI: Yes. From the Highest Authority. There are two conditions. The U.N. must be allowed to inspect the removal of the missiles.
FOMIN: And, of course, the U.N. must be allowed to observe the redeployment of forces from the American Southeast.
FOMIN: And the second condition?
SCALI: Time is of the essence.
FOMIN: John. How much time?
SCALI: 48 hours. In 48 hours there can be no deals.
