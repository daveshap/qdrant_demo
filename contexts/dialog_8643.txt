JOEL: I should maybe talk to you.
VOICE-OVER: Clementine. I should just maybe talk to her.
JOEL: I love you and if you knew that... if I told you what happened... I'll explain everything, what we meant to each other. I'll tell you everything about our time together. You'll know everything again and...
VOICE-OVER: Maybe if I just explain what happened, I wouldn't have to go through this and I could tell you everything and it would be like you knew and we could rebuild and we could be happy again and...
JOEL: Clementine.
VOICE-OVER: That's your look for me.
PATRICK: I just thought I'd say hi. I was in the neighborhood.
CLEMENTINE: You were not.
PATRICK: I was not.
CLEMENTINE: Come over after I'm done here?
PATRICK: I can't. I want to, but I have to study.
CLEMENTINE: You rat.
PATRICK: I really want to, but tonight's important. Test tomorrow.
JOEL: How could she have done this to me? How could anyone do this to anyone?
CLEMENTINE: You didn't say anything about my hair.
PATRICK: It's so cool. You're by far the most sensational person in the room.
CLEMENTINE: In the room?
PATRICK: In the world.
