I lied to my friend...
Hey, I made this account just cause I wanted some advice and wanted to know what I should do- I started playing WoW when I was 12 and since nobody really likes kids (especially in games like WoW) I said I was 15. My voice could easily pass for a 15 year old at the time and I wasn’t exactly immature so it was pretty believable. I made some friends who were 15/16, and they believed I was 15 at the time. I’m 14 (almost 15) now and they’re 17/18. They think I’m 17. I don’t know if I should tell them the truth, I know it sounds childish but I’m scared that they wouldn’t want to talk to me since I’m younger. Should I tell them or keep up the charade? And in the future, should I tell people my real age or say I’m older? I’m pretty lost.
