MAXINE: What?
CRAIG: I just wanted to say “hi.” Did you know I still don't know your name or where you work?
MAXINE: Yeah.
CRAIG: How about this, if I can guess your first name within three tries, you have to come out for a drink with me tonight.

MAXINE: Who told you?
CRAIG: I'm right?
MAXINE: Who told you?
CRAIG: That's incredible! Nobody told me! I swear! It's kismet. Maxine! It's a beautiful name. There's a psychic connection. Don't you see? It was meant to be! Maxine! Maxine! Maxine! I will shout it from the rooftops!
MAXINE: Somebody told you.
CRAIG: Oh, Maxine, nobody told me. Maxine, Maxine. It just came out of me like a song, Maxine. A beautiful crazy, song, Maxine. Maxine. Maxine!
MAXINE: I am dubious, but I don't welsh. Meet me at The Stuck Pig. Seven o'clock. You're late, I walk. So help me, if I find out you cheated.
CRAIG: Maxine.
LESTER: Imagine a room full of women. Nubile, blonde, wet with desire, Schwartz. A harem, if you will. Me in leather. A harness, if you like. I am the object of this desire, and all eyes are on me as I speak. “Ladies,” I begin. “I am the love god, Eros. I intoxicate you. My spunk is to you manna from heaven...
CRAIG: Dr. Lester, it's been really fascinating, but I'm afraid I have to get home to my wife now.
LESTER: Wife, huh? I'd love to meet her, Craig.
CRAIG: Yessir.
LESTER: Shall we say dinner on Friday. Just the two of us? You can come too if you like, Schwartz.
CRAIG: That's sounds fine, sir. Gotta run.
CRAIG: Made it. Maxine. Maxine, Maxine, Maxine.
MAXINE: Just.
CRAIG: Buy you a drink, Maxine?
MAXINE: You married?
CRAIG: Yeah. But enough about me.
CRAIG: What'll you have?
MAXINE: The usual, Barry.
CRAIG: I'll have, like, a beer. Like a Budweiser, or something.
CRAIG: I like you. I don't know what it is exactly.
MAXINE: My tits?
CRAIG: No, no, it's your energy or your attitude or the way you carry yourself or...
MAXINE: Christ, you're not a fag are you? Because I don't want to be wasting my time.
CRAIG: That's the usual?
MAXINE: Don’t let the girly shit fool you. It'd blow your shorts off.
