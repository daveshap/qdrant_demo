SCHOOL-MARM"": Let me tell him. Let him decide.
KITTLE: You're not gonna see him again.
SCHOOL-MARM"": What... what makes you think you can order me around?!
KITTLE: Maybe I'm not making myself clear. You're probably the first girl Billy-Boy's ever fallen in love with, and I know for sure you're the first he's slept with. So, how's he gonna feel... ... when he finds out that the only first he is for you is the first guy who didn't have to pull out at the last second to get his close-up?
KITTLE: Hasn't he got enough problems, or didn't you notice that's not cream soda on his breath?
SCHOOL-MARM"": ... okay... you made your point.
