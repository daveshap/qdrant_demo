Who is an average "climate change denier"?
I'm from the country with almost no public climate change debate. For a long time I thought that "climate change denialism" means in US literally denying climate change. 

It turned out, many people labeled by media in such way don't doubt the change itself, but rather extent of human influence or extent of potential negative effects. I had been mistaken by taking the meaning literally. 

So it seems there is a whole spectrum of people called denialists: from denial of any current dramatic change on the one side to impact indifference on the other (that is believing that change is happening and caused by humans and would lead to negative effects, but that these effects would be negligible in comparison to avoidance costs). As these positions cover a very broad range, is there some statistics on them for US? 

In wikipedia there are stats on perception of human influence and of potential threat. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_opinion_by_country. But maybe there is more detailed analysis of positions spectrum somewhere? 

As a side question, what is **perception** in US of the "denier" label? That is, are US people as confused as me about it's actual meaning in variety of cases or there is a consensus on that?
