JULIE: No, I'm not kidding you, <u>Philip</u>.
PHIL: What next?! -- A strange bra under my pillow!
JULIE: I <u>remember</u> what day you wore that jacket. It was <u>Monday</u>. The day you were all day in <u>meetings</u> again? And had to send out for <u>sandwiches</u>?
PHIL: Honey, you know what I've been like lately... I've been a total zombie. I have no idea what that was doing in my pocket.
JULIE: Well, what about <u>these</u>? Do you usually put your <u>carbons</u> in your pocket, too?!
PHIL: Sweetheart, this is a very risky time for me right now. Maybe you don't appreciate that.
JULIE: I don't care, Philip. You want to go chasing Barbara Zelman, go ahead. Just watch out for those buck teeth.
PHIL: Barbara <u>Zelman</u>? I don't believe this!
JULIE: Do you usually pay for Charlie? At Trattoria <u>Valentino</u>"?"
PHIL: Honey, I can't track of all the meals Charlie and I have been having. This is a delicate time. If it leaks out that I'm jumping ship before I'm set up someplace else I could be out on my ear before I'm ready with nothing. With <u>nothing</u>.
JULIE: There <u>are</u> people who do things because they <u>want</u> to get caught.
PHIL: Who told you that -- someone on the radio?
JULIE: Fuck you, Philip.
JULIE: I thought we'd be happy here.
PHIL: Honey, I'm sorry, I think the vacation will be a good break for both of us. You'll see.
PHIL: The cab's waiting!
JULIE: Where should I hide the car keys?
PHIL: I don't know -- put 'em in the drawer with all the Chinese take- away menus.
JULIE: Did you lock the garage door?
