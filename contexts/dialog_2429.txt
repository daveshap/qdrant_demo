GARY: Jumbo, where the hell are the women?
JUMBO: What are you talking about, asshole?
GARY: Your whores never showed up.
JUMBO: They left an hour ago, pink nuts.
GARY: Screw you!
JUMBO: That's it, prick lips.
GARY: What are you...
JUMBO: I've had it, numb nuts... How much money you got?
GARY: Why?
JUMBO: Because I'm pissed off. Now give me your cash.
GARY: This is bad public relations. I was planning to do a lot of business with you. But now I'm going to have to go elsewhere.
JUMBO: Hey. I'm sorry. You want girls. I'll give you girls.
JUMBO: Give him the works.
GARY: That's more like it.
DEBBIE: Are you sure this is a good idea?
ILENE: Look, you heard what those hookers said. They were supposed to go to a bachelor party.
DEBBIE: That doesn't mean it was Rick's party.
ILENE: Debbie, men are pigs -- if they can have women, we can have men.
