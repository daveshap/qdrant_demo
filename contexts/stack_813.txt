Set persistent notification for certain app The problem: I recieve skype messages while afk and I don't notice the little orange dot in the trayicon when I'm back.The question: I'd like to make Skype's notifications persistent on screen (until I dismiss them) so that I don't miss them. Is it possible to make notifications sent by apps persistent?I'm on: Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using Skypeforlinux (Skype version 8.22.0.2)Any other solution to make me notice skype's notifications (like make blinking dock icon) is welcomedP.S. it is not a duplicate of older similar question since those refer to a different skype version that didn't used the system notification by default. Now it does and it isn't possible to customize it anymore (I was used to setup a messagebox whenever a message from a new chat was sent)
