Being born ugly sets you up to fail
They say looks don’t matter, but unfortunately that isn’t true. For some of us, the amount of grooming, styling and exercising we do just can’t fix bad genes. While adults may not judge someone on face value if they are unattractive, being made fun of as a kid leads to a chain of effects

Get made fun for appearance as a kid/teen...

Don’t have anyone to hang with...

Shattered confidence...

Staying home on weekends and not talking much during school...

Not developing social skills...

Being socially inept as an adult
