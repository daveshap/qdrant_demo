I got a steady job!
I did it, y'all! I'm got a steady full time job!

It started out with just an application, then an interview, then training, then my my licensing exam yesterday. Even though I was so nervous through out each step of the process, I'm so thankful and proud that I was able to get this far.

Yesterday as I was waiting for the scores to come back on my exam, I felt sick and wanted to vomit. The suspense was killing me and the entire time I was training, I also kept thinking how awful a job I was doing. But you know what? Everything turned out okay. Good things can happen. Your anxiety isn't right until it's actually right and something bad has happened, so screw it! Do your best!

EDIT: Thank you so much everyone! I'm glad to have your support. Those of you who are waiting to hear back from your job hunts, I wish you the best of luck. We can do this!!!
