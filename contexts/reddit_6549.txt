Leave a company or stay during a "transition" period?
I moved a couple years ago with my family to come work for a mechanical design build contractor. Two years ago, the company was sold and moved from a family owned business to a private corporation. Shortly after, the original owner died. About a year ago, the owner's son left the company over a disagreement with the new corporation about how they're running the company.

Within the last two months, the owner's son has opened up his own business across the street doing the exact same type of work. He was one of the lead design engineers here, so not a big surprise. He has made it clear he intends to put us out of business. He has since taken with him the following people:

\-another head engineer

\-manpower supervisor

\-service group leaders

And there is already talk of several field employees/more office employees going with, most of them all with high knowledge of this field and our business.

My question is if it is worth sticking around at my company during this transition period. I have several other prospects I could look in to, but I'd like to stay and finish out my projects, about another 3-5 weeks.

My concern is if I do tender my 2 weeks resignation, their MO so far has been to walk people out on the spot. I am unsure if they are paid or not for the 2 weeks.

On top of that, my personal phone, laptop, and car are all currently through my employer, so if I left, that would be one of the conditions of my new employment.

Anyone been in a similar situation? What are your thoughts or advice?
