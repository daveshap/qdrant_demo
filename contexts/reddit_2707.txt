The biggest career transition in all of history?
Hi Career folks,

I just watched an interview on post Covid19 world and the expert they had on made a statement which perked me up. 

He stated that 'when things recover, many people had time to think about what they want to do - many people will decide not to return to what they were doing before. This is going to be the biggest career transition in all of history'.

I am somewhat doubtful with this statement, however it does apply to my situation. I have been planning and working towards a career change well before covid situation. Now I am even in more hurry to move into a different field.

What are your thoughts? Do you foresee many people jumping ship? are you planning to returning to your old post if still available?
