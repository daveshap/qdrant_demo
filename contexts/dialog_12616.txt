BARRY: Un-fucking-believable. Dick's out on a hot date, Rob's boning Marie LaSalle, and the best-looking and most intelligent of all of us isn't getting anything at all.
ROB: How do you know about that?
BARRY: Oh come on, Rob. What am I, an idiot? I'm more bothered by Dick's thing. How did this happen, Dick? What rational explanation can there possibly be? What's her name?
DICK: Anna.
BARRY: Anna who? Anna Green Gables? Anna Conda?
DICK: Anna Moss.
BARRY: Anna Moss. Mossy. The Mossy Thing. The Swamp Thing. Is she all green and furry?
ROB: Shut the fuck up, Barry.
BARRY: Yeah, you would say that, wouldn't you? You two have to stick together now. Boners United. United in getting some.
ROB: Don't be sad, Barry. You'll find true love someday.
BARRY: Suck my ass.
ROB: Terrific.
ROB: Don't worry about it, Dick. Barry's an asshole.
DICK: Yeah... Well... I'll see you tomorrow, Rob.
