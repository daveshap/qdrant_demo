Where does the Document Viewer (Evince) store history? I would like to access \uff08to view\uff09 the list of \"Recently viewed\" in Evince documents from the terminal, without starting Evince. Or maybe can I find a text document where this list is stored? I am using Ubuntu 16.04.Paradisally, I would like to find a complete list of Evince documents opened during the previous session or at least a history file, where opened documents are listed together with the dates of opening or at least in the order of opening.Can you guys help me with this?Update:Unfortunately, in my system recently-used.xbel is a really short file. It is just 218 bytes and contains nothing related to Evince.
