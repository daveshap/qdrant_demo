sometimes I just feel like crying out of nowhere
I'm 16 and probably depressed, and within the past 6-ish months I just feel like I'm gonna cry out of nowhere. like, I'll just be watching youtube, or drawing, or be in school and I'll feel like I'm gonna start crying.  I've stopped going to the counselors at my school because they're no help.   
I probably have depression, but last time I went to check out if I did was two years ago, and I was told I didn't have it.  now I'm pretty sure I do.  my mom doesn't want me getting anti-depressants because she "doesn't want me to rely on medication my whole life" (she's in an essential oil MLM so that probably influences her opinion on me getting meds)  
so, a lot of the time it's when I'm at home that I feel like I'm gonna start crying out of nowhere, but sometimes it's at school.   
I don't know why this happens. and I don't like it when people try to find a reason cause I don't think there is one.
