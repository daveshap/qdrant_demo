EVE: Chauncey...
CHANCE: Hello, Eve.
EVE: Chauncey, I just wanted to wish you well. I know you'll be smashing.
CHANCE: Thank you, Eve.
EVE: And Benjamin sends along his best wishes.
CHANCE: How is Ben feeling?
EVE: He's tired, Chauncey - but he's going to watch you tonight. We'll both be watching.
CHANCE: That's good. I like to watch, too.
EVE: I know you do - you and your television... ... Good luck, Chauncey.
COURTNEY: ... Gardiner is laconic, matter-of fact. The scuttlebutt is that he's a strong candidate for one of the vacant seats on the board of First American. But before we can do any sort of a piece on the man, we're going to need facts on his background... ... Kinney, what did you come up with?
KINNEY: ... Nothing.
COURTNEY: ... Skip the levity, Kinney - what have you got?
KINNEY: ... I realize this sounds banal but there is no information of any sort on Gardiner. We have no material on him - zilch...
HULL: Mr. Gardiner, I'm Morton Hull, the producer of 'This Evening.'
CHANCE: Hello, Morton.
HULL: Of course, Mr. Gardiner, the fact that you occupy such a position in the world of finance makes you ideally suited to provide our millions of viewers with an explanation of this nation's economic crisis.
CHANCE: I see.
HULL: Do you realize, Mr. Gardiner, that more people will be watching you tonight than all those who have seen theater plays in the last forty years?
CHANCE: Yes. It's a very good show.
HULL: I'm glad you like it, Mr. Gardiner.
