Choose yourself, not them
PSA to anyone who needs to hear this:

On the topic of waiting... 
On the topic of "taking a break"...
On the topic of "if it's meant to be, we'll happen again"...

Don't. 

Don't wait. Don't tell people you guys are taking a break. Don't hope that maybe after they're done fooling around they'll come back to you. 

Because if they fucked up, know that they messed it up, and STILL aren't coming around, then why do they deserve you? 

An anonymous note to my ex: I knew you weren't the one when you told me you missed me, told me I was the best thing you lost out on, and STILL didn't do anything to get me back. If you really thought those things you wouldn't be dating someone else right now. 

To whoever needs to hear this, choose YOURSELF before you choose the person you love. Don't disrespect yourself by letting someone know they can walk back into your life whenever they want. You deserve all the best in the world, not someone who doesn't appreciate you for who you are.

EDIT: Thank you so much everyone for the support on this post! ‚ù§ I'm glad so many people were able to find comfort through my words and so many more shared their stories and talked with each other in the comments :) feels a bit more like Facebook than Reddit now but oh well haha
