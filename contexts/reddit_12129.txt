I didn't get to experience HS graduation or prom
I was dealing with mental health problems during HS so I ended up skipping lots of classes and eventually dropped out/expelled of HS, now I'm planning on finishing HS education through online courses, but it sucks that I'll never get to experience prom, or the graduation ceremony, especially with my buddies from elementary and high school. I seen some of them posted videos of their graduation on social media, even at the moment where they all threw their academic hat into the air, it makes me feel jealous and left out. It made me feel better when one of my mates said he didn't go to prom, but he still went to the graduation ceremony, I even saw him in the video, I wish I was there, fml. Their families were probably so proud of them, seeing them receiving their diplomas, while I'm here at home dropped out good for nothing.
