what happens if ufw firewall is inactive? I want to know more of what ufw is. I'll ask some questions and you can let me know if i'm right or not.1) ufw helps us to block connections or allow connections from specific ip address or whatever. I'm curious what happens if ufw is not enabled which means it's INACTIVE. does it mean it allows anything at all? whatever we want?2) let's say I enabled ufw, add one rule. if the answer to previous question was (IT ALLOWS ANYTHING If it's inactive) , then if I only have one rule and ufw is active, it means anything else(any kind of my service that listens on some port) is blocked by default and I have to enable it to allow it.Thank you.
