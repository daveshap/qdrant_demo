Hall Director with questions of layoffs
Hello all.

I hope I'm not adding to the fear and anxiety already present everywhere. I just want to be prepared for whatever happens next.

As the title states I am a Hall Director. I recently (as in the last 6 months) started my job but now with residents leaving and things like summer courses going online  and summer conferences canceling I am wondering if there would be layoffs. I have never been fired or experience a layoff so I don't know what to expect. I am hoping a four-year university is able to keep me but I dont know what I'm looking at.

Is it likely that they will layoff the newest person first? Would I get enough warning? I do not have the ability to move back home without being a big burden on my family, went bankrupt, and spent 4 months of near  homelessness before finding this job. I barely started saving up money again so I d ok nt have that cushion yet. I know I can get through this but I don't know how this works and how it would work in a university.

Any help or pointers would be appreciated.
