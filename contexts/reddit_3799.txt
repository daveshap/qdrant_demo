I miss the feeling of being loved
I feel like I haven’t felt it in so long... this is the longest I’ve been single in my entire life (2 years). I miss being kissed, cuddled, going out, having someone to always talk to. Having someone to go to and tell your day to after work... ): I miss it all and just feel so alone... ): I have so much love to give just no one to give it to
