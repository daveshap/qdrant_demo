wine needs Mono but does not install it Just installed the latest wine on 16.04 (all updated+upgraded) and tried to run a windows installer \"wine nn4me.exe\" and it showed \"...needs .NET, but it is better to use ... Mono ...\" and an \"Install\" button.I clicked that and nothing happened. Waited five minutes, still no activity on the progress-bar nor on the modem/router LEDs.Thought it might be a \"sudo\" thing so tried \"sudo wine nn4me.exe\" and got a message \"you don't own wine\"How do I get it to install Mono and my program?Thanks
