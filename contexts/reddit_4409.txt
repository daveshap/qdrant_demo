I just want to stay in my bed and cry
I don't want to do anything, I just want to stay in my bed and cry. I'm still eating which I guess is good but I'm spending so much money on deliveries because I can't be bothered to go grocery shopping or cook. 

I managed to fold some laundry yesterday but I couldn't bother to actually put it away so it's all neatly folded on the floor.

I just want to be happy.

I go out and lay down on the grass instead of my room get some sunshine but it just makes me sadder that everything is so beautiful and I'm not happy.

I tried to hang out with friends but I don't have a good time, I wish I did but I just don't.

I just want to be happy but I can't stop crying.
