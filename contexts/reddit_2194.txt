It's crazy how little this really matters
Everyone in this bitch thinking the admission decision we receive in a month, or a few more, is going to determine the trajectory of our lives. You've got to be on some to really believe that. Your high school gpa is not part of the criteria for med school, for law school, for landing that dank job at a social media business, for creating some phenomenal music that takes off and moves the world, or for being happy. My friends, take a breather for a minute and just think how lucky we are to live in a world where we can truly create our own opportunities from almost nothing. all love
