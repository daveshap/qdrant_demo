THORFINN'S MUM: And if you have to kill somebody, KILL them! Don't stop to think about it.
THORFINN: I never do...
SVEN'S DAD: It's a tradition.
SVEN: I know, Dad.
SVEN'S DAD: I was a Berserk for King Harald Fairhair...
SVEN: You went berserk...
SVEN'S DAD: I went berserk in every battle I ever fought for King Harald...
SVEN: So did your father...
SVEN'S DAD: So did my father and his father before him.
SVEN: But it's a responsibility...
SVEN'S DAD: But it's a responsibility being a Berserk.
SVEN: I must only let the red rage...
SVEN'S DAD: You must only let the red rage take hold of you in the thick of battle.
SVEN: I KNOW! I'VE HEARD IT ALL 1 THOUSAND TIMES!
