MACKELWAY: Every cop has a story and every story has a girl. The girl in my story was fifteen years-old. She wore a pink angora sweater -- I can still see it -- one day, she disappeared. I told the police she wouldn't run away, I told them who to look for, but I was just a kid. I sat in the police station crying and crying. My parents took me home. The girl was my cousin and the man who abducted her was a teacher I'd had. He kept her alive a week before he killed her. The police could have saved her. Every time I see a photo of a victim I see her. That's what I want to do. I want to save her.
KULOK: Me too. Make any headway with Zorro"?"
MACKELWAY: None. Can't find a thing. Nothing on file, nothing online. It's not a part of any known killer's signature.
KULOK: I was thinking, maybe we should ask Professor Daitz. Nobody knows this stuff better.
MACKELWAY: That's because he's a fucking wacko. Never met a self-promotion scheme he didn't like. What's he doing now?
KULOK: He's a consultant to a network TV program on Profilers. He gets a check every episode.
