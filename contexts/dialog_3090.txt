ALFRED: Welcome, Master Grayson. I'm Alfred.
DICK: How ya doin', Al?
ALFRED: Al?
DICK: Big house. How many rooms?
BRUCE: Gee, I'm not sure. Alfred? How many rooms? Total?
ALFRED: Ninety-three, including the sauna.
BRUCE: Take any three you like. After you get settled we can...
DICK: Okay. I'm outta here.
BRUCE: Excuse me.
DICK: I figure telling that cop I'd stay here saved me a truckload of social service interviews and good will. So no offense but thanks. See ya.
BRUCE: Where will you go? The circus is halfway to Metropolis by now.
DICK: I got no place at the circus without my family. I'm going to get a fix on Two-Face. Then I'm going to kill him.
BRUCE: Listen, Dick. Killing Two-Face won't take the pain away. It'll make it worse.
DICK: Look, spare me the sermons, okay. You're just some rich guy who is trying to do a good deed. You don't even know me.
