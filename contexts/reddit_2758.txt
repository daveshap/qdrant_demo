Had a serious panic attack at work. Is this a good time to jump off?
Hi all,

I'm 26 (M) and I've been working as an analyst in a bank for 1 and a half years. It's a stressful job, we take a lot of shit from different people. The internal policies are ridiculous, they treat us like children, the work is incredibly tedious and repetitive, and honestly there doesn't seem to be much room for growth (the higher up jobs look unbearable). 

We have about two managers per analyst... And all that the managers do is discuss projects that never happen, fight over the holiday schedule, or convince us that we don't need to get paid for overtime.

I want out, I want to change industries all together. I have about 3 months savings at the moment and I was thinking of sucking it up for a few months while I applied to schools and saved some more.

But I have an anxiety disorder which stems from PTSD. I've kept my anxiety and depression on the down low at work, even though I know that my job enhances my symptoms. I've been muscling through, sometimes it gets really hard and I hide in the bathroom.

Today, while I was chatting with my manager, I suddenly felt like I couldn't breathe. Then I felt like I was going to die. I couldn't stand straight. Suddenly there was an ambulance and I was taken to the hospital. They had me there for three hours or so... At the end I just started crying.

Right now I'm at home trying to process what just happened. I'm terrified of going back to work tomorrow. I'm terrified that this might happen again. I don't want to go back. Is this a good time to jump off? Can I say I need to take this time to focus on my mental health and have a look at other options?

(Thanks so much for reading)
