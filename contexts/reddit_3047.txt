I lost my job because of Coronavirus, What should I do now?
What’s up everyone, I recently got laid off from my electrical job as a helper.Work was slowing down because no one wants us in there houses or offices. My company is looking to lay off a couple more because of it. I worked there for 8 months and now I’m looking to go into a different career field, any suggestions? Is right now a good time to look for a job? I still got bills to pay so I need to find something for the mean time. I’m 18 btw 
Thank you!
