Advice during time of cancellations?
I'm a chemistry major going into my senior year of college. I have 3 on campus jobs relating to STEM and higher ed administration, research experience, and I was accepted at an REU... and all of it is gone due to COVID-19.

I understand why, but I would be lying if I said I wasn't upset. I feel like I had finally started to build towards the life I wanted for my future only to have it ripped away. I'm struggling to even get lab tech jobs in manufacturing plants because nobody is hiring. 

I'm debating whether it is worth it to go back for my senior year if my school is online, or if I should take the year off, work, and go back once I can actually show up to labs. This would, of course, be dependent on me actually finding a lab job of some type- if I'm going to take a year off, I should at least gain some relevant skills.

My goal is to become a professor at a PUI, but that's feeling less and less realistic every day and I'm starting to feel like I'll never have a career that I am passionate about and where I feel valued in my workplace.

Advice?
