DEWEY: You broke my heart.
GALE: What are we looking for?
DEWEY: A bloody knife. A ghost mask. Something like that?
GALE: Can we turn the light on?
DEWEY: That's not the way it's done.
DEWEY: And it's sexier in the dark.
GALE: Dewey, you and I would never make it.
DEWEY: Maybe not. But think about the sex. As frustrated as I am...
GALE: ..and as lonely as I am...
DEWEY: We'd break some furniture.
