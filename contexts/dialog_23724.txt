FORSYTHE: OK, Roger. Here's the stuff you wanted. Files on Horsefield, Tudor, Swinburne, and Velakofsky. Papers published by Hobbes, Linsky, and Lefebvre in a couple of issues of the Bulletin of the Canadian Medical Association and also the Journal of the American Medical Association. And, as an added extra, a couple of odds and ends from the files I helped compile before your time here, Doctor. I thought they might interest you.
ST. LUC: That's great, Forsythe, great. Thanks.
FORSYTHE: Do I get a kiss?
FORSYTHE: Kiss, kiss?
ST. LUC: Uh, OK. Sure.
FORSYTHE: Another kiss?
ST. LUC: C'mon, Forsythe. Are there any more on the list?
FORSYTHE: No. Dotty's the last.
ST. LUC: Yes?
ROLLO: That you, Rog?
ST. LUC: Yes?
ROLLO: It's me, Rollo Linsky. Remember me?
ST. LUC: Rollo! How'sa boy? I was just thinking about you.
