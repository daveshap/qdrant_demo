How do I make my girlfriend understand that wednesday nights is video game night with boys?
I play world of warcraft and Wednesday nights are the only time that all of my friends come together to hang out and do content on World of Warcraft? She thinks I'm being anti-social however, playing world of warcraft gives my friend group an excuse to come together and just talk about life while we're doing raids and other content on wow.
