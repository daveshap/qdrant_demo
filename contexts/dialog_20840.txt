GIBBS: Curse you for breathing, you slack- jawed idiot. Mother's love, Jack, you know better than to wake a man when he's sleeping. It's bad luck!
JACK: Well, fortunately, I know how to counter it. The man who did the waking buys the man who was sleeping a drink, and the man who was sleeping it drinks it while listening to a proposition.
GIBBS: Aye, that'll about do it.
GIBBS: Blast it, I'm already awake!
WILL: I know. That was for the smell.
