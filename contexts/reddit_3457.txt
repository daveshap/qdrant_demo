I (26M) met a Hinge date during this lock down and now we're living together for the entire lockdown and it's amazing fun!
I matched with her last week Saturday and started chatting and switched to Video call in not more than half an hour. We clicked so well that we ended up talking for 8 hours throughout the night and slept at 7am.

We wanted to catch up but the cab services were down (travel history was checked from both ends). Spent the whole day talking on video call when at 1.30 in the night, I just happened to check the cab services and one showed nearby. I sent a request, it got accepted and I was on my way. I was so scared and honestly felt my guts shivering for the fear of being stopped by cops.

Reached her place, she wasn't a serial killer(thank god!) and ended up spending the night and the next night at her place. We then moved to my place on Tuesday and have been here since.

It's so much fun having her around, not to mention the fact that we both like cooking so all the free time goes in cooking something delicious (she's a better cook, hands down!).

I guess I'm one of the few ones who's seriously enjoying this quarantine and hoping that it doesn't end too soon!

If you have a quarantine Valentine, I'm hoping you're having as much fun as I am!

UPDATE: Got a request for an update so here it is. We had our first fight. In the middle of while things were getting hot. For what you ask - because as I pulled her hair (which she likes) she suddenly realised a few of those locks are falling out. Cue mental breakdown and blue balls.

Other than that, we cooked white sauce pasta today, smoked up and got high!
