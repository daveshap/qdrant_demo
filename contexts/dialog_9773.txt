MRS. STANWYK: Stay! I must be having an off day. I'm really a fabulous player.
FLETCH: I have this effect on lots of women.
MRS. STANWYK: I bet you do.
FLETCH: Say, the reason I asked about Alan is that I bumped into him this morning and you know what I can't figure out?
MRS. STANWYK: Alan's in Utah.
FLETCH: I can't figure out why I went to Utah for the morning.
MRS. STANWYK: Okay. I'm delighted to have someone to talk to, and you're very cute, so I'm very flattered, but I'm also very married so you may as well forget -- You are trying to hit on me, aren't you?
FLETCH: I'm such a heel. How'd you guess?
MRS. STANWYK: If I had a nickel for every one of Alan's flyboy buddies who tried to pick me up, I'd be a rich woman.
FLETCH: You are a rich woman.
MRS. STANWYK: See what I mean?
FLETCH: What's he doing in Utah?
MRS. STANWYK: None of your business, now go away. You're throwing my game off.
