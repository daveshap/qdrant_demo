Select n cells from a raster maximizing their variance I work in R, especially using 'raster' package. It is a computational problem too hard for my syntax capacities.STEP 1.I have a one band raster, and what I want to select is a set of n cells (in my case, n = 15) as different as possible different regarding their values. In mathematical terms, in my selection I want to maximize the variance of values. Obviously, there are a huge amounts of combinations, but I would select the best one solution.STEP 2. One further methodological complication is that at the same time I would like to maximize the distance between cells. I mean, once reached a set of possibilities from step1 (variance optimization), I would like to select the best solution in terms distance between cells (for example, the sum of distance between cells).Is it possible? (at least the step1, but preferentially also step2)
