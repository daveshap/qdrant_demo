What would be the benefits or drawbacks of imposing Congressional term limits?
I read an article about introducing term limits terms for both the house and the senate. The proposed amendment would limits senators to two terms and house members to terms.


I know this idea has been presented before. Why did it fail then? Why would it fail now and how likey is that?
