EMMETT: Are you all right?
HANNAH: This is a brutal land.
EMMETT: You must have known that before you came.
HANNAH: It's one thing to know it...
HANNAH: We told Sheriff Cobb about the attack. He said he'd... look into it. I can't believe he's the law out here. Now I see why you all wear guns.
EMMETT: How's Mr. Parker doing?
HANNAH: Just like you'd think. But he's not going to run. We're sticking to our plan. Now we both need help.
SHERIFF COBB: He must be pretty good.
MCKENDRICK: He's good, all right. Too good for my men. That's why you've got to take care of it.
SHERIFF COBB: What about his brother?
MCKENDRICK: We'll handle that. He's careless.
SHERIFF COBB: Things are getting messy around here. I hear Ezra Johnson got himself killed.
MCKENDRICK: I heard that too.
SHERIFF COBB: Did you hear his son is still around?
