Do the changing sentencing positions of the US government in the Roger Stone case constitute a violation of US law or DoJ policy?
Yesterday the Department of Justice filed a [sentencing memorandum](https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.203583/gov.uscourts.dcd.203583.279.0_2.pdf) for Roger Stone, who had provided information from WikiLeaks to the Trump campaign during 2016.  Stone was convicted in November 2019 by a jury of obstructing a Congressional investigation, making false statements to Congress, and witness tampering.

In that sentencing memorandum, the DoJ sought a sentence within the range they calculated the US Sentencing Guidelines to suggest of 87 to 108 months (7-9 years).

Stone's attorneys [disputed](https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.203583/gov.uscourts.dcd.203583.280.0.pdf) the guidelines calculation made by the government, and believe the guidelines range should be 15-21 months imprisonment.  They also requested a downward departure from that range, seeking only probation without incarceration.

After the sentencing memorandum from the government was filed, President Trump [tweeted](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1227122206783811585) 

>"This is a horrible and very unfair situation. The real crimes were on the other side, as nothing happens to them. Cannot allow this miscarriage of justice!"  

>>@ChuckRossDC  "Prosecutors recommend up to NINE YEARS in prison for Roger Stone. They call foreign election interference a "deadly adversary" even though Stone was never accused of working with Russians or WikiLeaks."

After the President's tweet, news broke that the Department of Justice intended to file a second sentencing memorandum, [overriding the prosecutors who had signed the original sentencing memorandum.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-stone/in-reversal-justice-department-to-seek-shorter-sentence-for-trump-adviser-stone-idUSKBN2052E5)

After that news breaking, one of the prosecutors who had signed the original sentencing brief [gave notice to the court that he was no longer working on the case, and had resigned as a special assistant US Attorney for the District of Columbia.](https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.203583/gov.uscourts.dcd.203583.282.0_5.pdf)  A second prosecutor also [resigned as an Assistant US Attorney](https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.203583/gov.uscourts.dcd.203583.283.0_3.pdf) shortly thereafter.

**Edit for subsequent developments.**  The DoJ has filed a ["supplemental and amended"](https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.203583/gov.uscourts.dcd.203583.286.0_5.pdf) sentencing memorandum, signed by John Crabb, Jr, who was not one of the attorneys previously on the case.  The supplemental memorandum says:

>The prior filing submitted by the United States on February 10, 2020 (Gov. Sent. Memo.
ECF No. 279) does not accurately reflect the Department of Justiceâ€™s position on what would be
a reasonable sentence in this matter. While it remains the position of the United States that a
sentence of incarceration is warranted here, the government respectfully submits that the range of
87 to 108 months presented as the applicable advisory Guidelines range would not be appropriate
or serve the interests of justice in this case

A third attorney previously the case, [Adam Jed](https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.203583/gov.uscourts.dcd.203583.285.0_10.pdf) has also withdrawn from the case.

My questions are:

1.  If the DoJ changed its position due to the President's tweet, or other pressure from the President, is that lawful?  Does it make a difference that the conduct Stone lied about related to the President's campaign?

2.  Is it in compliance with DoJ guidelines for attorneys, or the rules of professional ethics?
