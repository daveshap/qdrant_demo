Tell me I'm not the only one that do this
Sometimes I 'play' dead. Let me explain myself before you think I'm nuts. 
I stop breathing on purpose for as long as I can, and I pretend to be found dead. My body relaxes and I tilt my head to one side. My body is limp and unresponsive to any stimulation. Somehow, it calms me down when I'm having a crisis, because it is a dream that I can't make come true. I can't leave my family, since they would never forgive me.
Am I the only one that do this?
