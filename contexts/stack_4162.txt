Why does the \"job\" question in French visit visa application disappear as I answer an earlier question? I am applying for a French visit visa or Schengen Visa. When I answer yes (to the question \"A close member of your family is A national of EU?\") to confirm that my brother is an EU (British) citizen, the next answer regarding \u2018job\u2019 vanishes. What does that mean?
