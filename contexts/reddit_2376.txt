Has COVID made you reconsider, not just a job change, but an entire career shift moving forward?
I've been meeting people left and right who have outright considered COVID to be somewhat of a blessing in disguise in terms of their career shifts. This time in lockdown has allowed many people the time to sit and meditate on many things that have been swept under the rug for years.

Despite many of us being stuck in a pickle right now after having faced layoffs and furloughs, I've also run across many of the same people who are otherwise relieved to have finally been "freed" from their jobs.  It feels like the universe is playing a round of musical chairs with many of us right now.

So has COVID made you reconsider, not just a job change, but an **entire** career shift moving forward?
