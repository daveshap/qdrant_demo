Is it bad form to reapply to a place you turned down?
Hi all,

A few months ago, I was between two job offers — one with a great company and one for a (massive) promotion at my then-current job. I agonized over it for a few days but eventually chose the internal hire position due to higher pay and generally liking my coworkers. I politely conveyed my regrets to the other company and wished them luck.

Well, choosing this position was a mistake. I've tried to stick it out, but it's getting to the point where I simply can't take it anymore (not receiving enough training, no clear expectations, being spoken to very unprofessionally/made cry, etc.). I've been looking at other jobs lately, and found out that the other place is hiring for another (position I applied for).

So my question — is it bad form to reapply there? I had nothing but genuine interactions with those I interviewed with, and it purely came down to money (of course, I didn't tell them that). Am I likely to be seen as flaky, or have my application passed over for having chosen another opportunity? If I manage to get another interview, what do I even say?

Thank you!
