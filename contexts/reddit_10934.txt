Death isn't the worst thing, waking up and realizing you're constantly in pain is.
Can't even find the motivation to do anything anymore because my brain tries to pretend everything is alright, that stupid piece of shit. I have to make myself feel like crap in order to try and get anything done. I don't want to feel pain anymore. I've always told myself I'd make it out of this, that I'd live an enjoyable life after all, but I realize nothing is set in stone.
