WOMAN: This where the auditions are?
FRANK: This is where the auditions were.
WOMAN: What do you mean?
FRANK: We're finished.
WOMAN: What about me?
FRANK: You're an hour and a half late.
WOMAN: My watch is broken, too.
FRANK: Punctuality. First rule of show business.
WOMAN: This is show business?
FRANK: Look, miss. We're tired, you have gum on your lip, and we're going home.
WOMAN: Just like that, huh? You're not even gonna give me a chance?
FRANK: Don't take it personally.
WOMAN: How should I take it?
FRANK: Impersonally.
WOMAN: I don't believe it. I come all the way down down here, break a heel, and you're not gonna give me a chance because I have gum on my lip and I'm a few minutes late.
FRANK: You're an hour and a half late.
WOMAN: So if I'm so 'late how come you're still here?
FRANK: We ran long.
WOMAN: So run a little longer.
FRANK: Miss --
WOMAN: You find a girl?
JACK: No.
WOMAN: So. I'm here, you're here, the piano's here. What d'ya say?
FRANK: Terrific. Thirty-eight.
WOMAN: What's that mean? Thirty-eight.
JACK: Don't worry about it.
WOMAN: You know, I'm feeling a lot of hostility from you.
FRANK: Jack.
JACK: Let's get it over with.
FRANK: All right. What's your name?
WOMAN: Susie. Susie Diamond.
FRANK: Catchy. You have any previous entertainment experience, Miss Diamond?
