New York Mayor Bill DeBlasio has called for a national draft of civilian doctors to help the areas hardest hit by COVID-19, like New York City. Is there any legal basis for such an idea?
The [New York Times reports](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/nyregion/coronavirus-new-york-update.html) :

>Mayor Bill de Blasio called Thursday night for doctors and other medical  workers across the country to be drafted and sent to the places where  coronavirus has hit hardest â€” starting in New York.

The  Selective Service system is the existing mechanism for a military draft in the United States. It [currently specifies a random lottery of men between the ages of 20-25](https://www.sss.gov/about/return-to-draft/lottery/).  Is there a legal basis for the President to unilaterally modify these criteria to call on people in specific professions and ignore the gender and age requirements? If not, does the Constitution allow Congress to pass a new draft law that would? Is there any other legal mechanism available to the President outside of military use of the Selective Service that would enable these actions?
