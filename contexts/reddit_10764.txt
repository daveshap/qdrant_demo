anybody else feel permanently fucked up?
even if i tried to get my shit together and put any effort into fixing my life, i’m already seriously behind and my brain doesn’t work right, which would just make it all even harder than it should be. trauma seems to have had a serious impact on my ability to do simple tasks, remember things, focus, or be a reliable person in general. it’s been a while since anything terrible has happened to me, and yet i’m still fucked in the head. i feel like it’s gonna be this way forever. why even try?
