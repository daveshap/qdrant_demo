RASHID: Watch out, man. You'll get yourself killed like that.
PAUL: I can't believe I did that ... Christ. I'm walking around in a fog ...
RASHID: No harm done. Everything's okay now. I've got to be going.
PAUL: No, wait. You can't just walk off. You saved my life.
RASHID: I just happened to be there. The right place at the right time.
PAUL: I owe you something.
RASHID: It's okay, mister. No big deal.
PAUL: Yes it is. It's a law of the universe. If I let you walk away, the moon will spin out of orbit ... pestilence will reign over the city for a hundred years.
RASHID: Well, if you put it that way...
PAUL: You have to let me do something for you to put the scales in balance.
RASHID: That's all right. If I think of something, I'll send my butler over to tell you.
PAUL: Come on. At least let me buy you a cup of coffee.
RASHID: I don't drink coffee. On the other hand, since you insist, if you offered me a cold lemonade. I wouldn't say no.
PAUL: Good. Lemonade it is. I'm Paul.
RASHID: Rashid. Rashid Cole.
PAUL: Are you sure you don't want some food to go along with it? It might help to absorb some of that liquid. You don't want to slosh around too much when you stand up.
RASHID: That's okay. I've already had lunch.
PAUL: You must eat lunch pretty early. It's only eleven o'clock.
RASHID: I mean breakfast.
PAUL: Yeah, sure, and I bet you had lobster last night. Along with two bottles of champagne.
RASHID: Just one bottle. I believe in moderation.
PAUL: Look, kid, it's okay with me. You don't have to play games. If you want a hamburger or something, go ahead and order it.
RASHID: Well, maybe just one. To be polite.
PAUL: Cocktail hour is over. The young man would like to order a hamburger.
WAITRESS: How do you want that cooked?
RASHID: Medium rare, please.
WAITRESS: Fries?
RASHID: Yes, please.
WAITRESS: Lettuce and tomato?
RASHID: Yes, please.
WAITRESS: You want another one of these, too?
PAUL: Yeah, give him another one. And I'll take a cup of coffee while you're at it.
WAITRESS: Hot coffee or iced coffee?
PAUL: Do you have real iced coffee, or do you just pour hot coffee over some ice cubes?
WAITRESS: Everything is real in here, honey. As real as the color of my hair.
PAUL: I'll take the iced coffee. You only live once, right?
WAITRESS: If you're lucky. Then again, it depends on what you call living.
PAUL: I don't mean to pry, but I see a kid walking around with a big knapsack on his back, and I begin to wonder if all his worldly possessions aren't stowed in there. Are you in some kind of trouble or what?
RASHID: Mostly what.
PAUL: You don't have to tell me if you don't want to, but I might be able to help.
RASHID: You don't know me from a hole in the wall.
PAUL: That's true. But I also owe you something, and I'm not sure that buying you a hamburger is going to do the job. What is it? Family problems? Money problems?
RASHID: Oh no. Momsie and Popsie have oodles.
PAUL: And where do Momsie and Popsie live?
RASHID: East Seventy-fourth Street.
PAUL: In Manhattan?
RASHID: Of course. Where else?
PAUL: Then what are you doing in Park Slope? It's a little far from home, isn't it?
RASHID: That's where the what comes in.
PAUL: The what?
RASHID: The what. I've kind of run away from home, you see. It has nothing to do with my parents or money. I saw something I wasn't supposed to see, and for the time being it's best that I keep myself out of sight.
PAUL: You can't be more specific than that?
RASHID: Here and there. Around.
PAUL: Uh-huh. One of those cozy bed and breakfast places, probably.
RASHID: Yeah, that's right.
PAUL: Except that there's no bed, is there? And no breakfast either.
RASHID: The material world is an illusion. It doesn't matter if they're there or not. The world is in my head.
PAUL: But your body is in the world, isn't it? If someone offered you a place to stay, you wouldn't necessarily refuse, would you?
RASHID: People don't do that kind of thing. Not in New York.
PAUL: I'm not people." I'm just me. And I do whatever I goddamn want to do. Got it?"
RASHID: Thanks, but I'll manage.
PAUL: In case you're wondering, I like women, not little boys. And I'm not offering you a long-term lease -- just a place to crash for a couple of nights.
RASHID: I can take care of myself. Don't worry.
PAUL: Suit yourself. But if you change your mind, here's the address.
