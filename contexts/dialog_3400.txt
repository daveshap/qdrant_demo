ERROLL: Hello, I'm here about the ad.
CRAIG: Please, have a seat.
ERROLL: When you say, I can be somebody else, what do you mean exactly?
CRAIG: Exactly that. We can put you inside someone else's body for fifteen minutes.
ERROLL: Oh, this is just the medical breakthrough I've been waiting for. Are their any side effects? Please say no! Please say no!
MAXINE: No.
ERROLL: Long term psychic or physiological repercussions?
MAXINE: No. Don't be an ass.
ERROLL: Can I be anyone I want?
MAXINE: You can be John Malkovich.
ERROLL: Well that's perfect. My second choice. Ah, this is wonderful. Too good to be true! You see, I'm a sad man. Sad and fat and alone. Oh, I've tried all the diets, my friends. Lived for a year on nothing but imitation mayonnaise. Did it work? You be the judge. But Malkovich! King of New York! Man about town! Most eligible bachelor! Bon Vivant! The Schopenhauer of the 20th century! Thin man extraordinaire!
MAXINE: Two hundred dollars, please.
ERROLL: Yes. Yes. A thousand times, yes!
ERROLL: Oh, thank you! Thank you! Thousand times, thank you!
CRAIG: Tell your friends.
ERROLL: Oh, I will, and I have many, many friends and associates, my friend. All, by the way, in Overeaters Anonymous. All of them fat and alone like me, all of them dream of being someone else, all of them with John Malkovich as their second choice!
CRAIG: This is amazing! We're gonna be rich!
MAXINE: So unbolt the fucking door, Einstein.
LESTER: You're making a big mistake, Schwartz. Ma'am
CRAIG: Dr. Lester, I don't know what you're talking about.
LESTER: There are rules, boy, procedures, etiquette. This is not a toy. I've been waiting seventy years to utilize this room, grooming myself, quietly setting the stage, performing ablutions, paying tribute, seeing all his motion pictures again and again. Worshipping, Schwartz, worshipping properly.
CRAIG: You're insane.
LESTER: I am not alone. There are others. We are legion. You will pay for this blasphemy. You will pay dearly.
