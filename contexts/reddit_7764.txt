Check update 3!

Hey everyone,

I am a PhD student myself and struggling. Many many things are making me worried regarding my academic life. I thought about creating a support group for all of us in a similar situation. I thought about creating a discord server which, for those who don't know, is an app in the form of a chat/forum where you talk and can keep your anonymity, hence making you feel safe to share your personal struggles. I am also open to other suggestions like other apps. If you are interested send me a pm and we will start from there!

Update: I sent you the link via the reddit chat! Please check it out.

Update 2: Since I am receiving so many replies and chat messages, I will share here the link [https://discord.gg/egNNNY](https://discord.gg/egNNNY)
