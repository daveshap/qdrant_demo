Does anyone else get anxiety from being seen by someone they know?
If I’m at work, or at a store, or just driving my anxiety runs wild if I see someone I know. I’m not sure why I am so scared of being seen by people I know but I literally cannot just drive around with my windows down or anything like that. It’s giving me anxiety just thinking about it. I work a nice job and drive a nice car so I’m not embarrassed about it. Anyone else have this problem?
