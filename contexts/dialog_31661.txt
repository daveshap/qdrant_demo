XANDER: You got a great set-up here Yorgi. You really know how to live.
YORGI: It's a beautiful town, Prague. It's been good to me.
XANDER: I've been here before, when I was a kid. My old man was in the service, we used to live on the Army base in Hamburg.
YORGI: You, an Army brat? I don't see that one at all. Did you join the service as well?
XANDER: Hell no. My dad was a straight up tin soldier. Somehow he pissed this general off and got himself dishonorably discharged. Had a court martial and everything. The charges were total bullshit, so he was sure he'd get his name cleared, but it didn't happen.
YORGI: Connections and politics, it's the same everywhere.
XANDER: My old man, he bought into the system, and it screwed him. So he swallowed a bullet. Me, I don't believe in nothing I can't see and touch.
