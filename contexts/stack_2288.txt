Where are the Shards of Mehrune's Razor? I visited and cleared the Cracked Tusk Keep prior to getting the \"Pieces of the Past\" quest. Now that I've returned to the Cracked Tusk Vault to complete the quest, I cannot find the \"Shards of Mehrune's Razor\". They are not on the alter nor are they in my inventory? Where could they be?
