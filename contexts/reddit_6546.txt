Being recruited after just starting new job
I just started a new job in a new industry and role about 6 weeks ago. So far I am really liking the company, my team, my manager and the job itself. 

Out of no where, one of the people I met when I was job searching reached out to me about an open position. It pays around the same rate as I get now but with the potential for bonuses and I would work from home full time. It’s in the industry and role I previously left. I didn’t love the industry but it was mainly due to the company I had worked for in it. 

I really like the aspect of being able to work from home full time since that was something I’ve always wanted and would give me the flexibility to work on my side things. On the other hand, I’m currently in a role that’s teaching me great skills and new experiences that so far I’m enjoying. 

Is this open position something I should look into? Anyone ever get recruited for a job right after they started a new one? Interested in hearing what your take on this is.
