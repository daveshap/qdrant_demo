SUSAN: God, when we were in that store all I could think about was that one time, when we were in school, and you attacked that little kid who wanted some cereal. Do you remember that?
O'BRIEN: I remember I was trying to help...
SUSAN: God, what a fight that was.
O'BRIEN: We were different people then.
SUSAN: Do you suppose that was our problem? We met before our time? I think that happens a lot. People, events, planets all just circling each other waiting for that moment when everything clicks into place.
