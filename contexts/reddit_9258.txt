Opened my first savings account
And put $76 in it. All of my bills are paid.
I get paid again on the 10th and plan to put another $80 in.
I’m on fire and just wanted to share.

Edit: I do have some credit card debt with a paydown plan taking me to the end of 2020, and a few small personal debts to friends and family, but I merely didn’t want to delay this step towards an emergency/rainy day fund.

Second edit- wow a silver and a gold! My first ever! This seemingly small decision to open a savings account has such a powerful impact and I hope others will be inspired to make a small step to move towards their financial dreams too.
