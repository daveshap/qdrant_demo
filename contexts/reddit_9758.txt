Why Should I Create a Reddit Account for This?
Reddit is a dynamic place where the community gets to curate the content.  Posts (questions, topics, links, etc.) that are popular move to the top and don't get swallowed up based on when they were submitted.  

You can have longer text responses like a blog post, but with the community interaction that people love about Twitter.  Plus all the related reflections are compiled instead of being across scattered blogs.  

Take your time to submit a thorough answer - there's no timelines!  That's especially helpful for those people who need more time to process & reflect before responding, or who want to be able to cite/provide links.

Within a post, certain comments can be moved up or down, kind of like the amplifying effect of a RT on Twitter.

Basically, it's the greatest.  

Experienced Redditors - why do you see this as a great venue for SA discussions?  Add to my list in the comments! [New Redditors, you should probably read this Reddit 101 so you can get started **right now**.](http://mashable.com/2012/06/06/reddit-for-beginners/)
