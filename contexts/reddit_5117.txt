Not being kept after seasonal
So, I worked a job for over three months on contract. They hired twenty six seasonals and the two people who got hired on the same time as me got their contracts extended, but I did not and I can't help but not take it personally. I am truly appreciative for the opportunity I was given but I feel like I was snuffed out of getting to become a permanent. In my past I have had conflicts with other coworkers because our personalities clashed. Most of the time I was told I was not a good fit and I had to go. I keep having horrible flashbacks of those times and am taking this really personal. Over these three months, I have worked well with a majority of the people. There were a few who just don't like me, and thats fine, but I don't see why that should stop me from working there. There are over two hundred employees!!! I brought good numbers and sales, was very professional, and got great reviews. I am trying to move on, but afraid this will happen to me wherever I go.
