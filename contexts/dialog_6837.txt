MRS. CALDWELL: I can't tell you how happy we are that Cecile is going to be attending Oakwood with you this fall. You've always been an inspiration to Beau and I on raising her. We just hope she can rise to the high standards which you've set for her.
KATHRYN: I'll do my best.
CECILE: What was that?
KATHRYN: I was thanking her. Vietnamese is such a beautiful language.
KATHRYN: You're too kind.
MRS. CALDWELL: How do you do it? I mean with all peer pressuring that goes on in high school. Where do you get your strength?
KATHRYN: I know this sounds corny, but whenever I feel temptations of peer pressure, I... turn to God and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism, but it works.
MRS. CALDWELL: That's beautiful.
CECILE: What are the boys like?
MRS. CALDWELL: Cecile, is that the best you can do? You must forgive her, Kathryn. She's never been in a co-educational atmosphere before.
KATHRYN: Don't worry, it's totally understandable. Most of the boys that matriculate at Oakwood are very upstanding gentleman, however there are the occasional bad apples.
MRS. CALDWELL: Like your step-brother Sebastian. I can't believe they didn't expel him after what he did to the school nurse.
