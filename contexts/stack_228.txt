CPU speed of the Macbook Pro Retina downclocked I've a MacBook Pro 15\" late 2013. For a long time I have encoded videos with handbrake and the CPU was very hot for hours. The clock speed was about 2.8GHz (I have the 2.3GHz model) and the temperature was over 95\u00b0C. In one of the last updates of High Sierra I think there was some modification such that now the CPU speed while encoding a video is about 1.8GHz and the temperature is always lower than 80\u00b0C. What can I do? I've lost about the 35% of the power of my mac....
