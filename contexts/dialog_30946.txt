SKIPPER: What's on your mind?
CHUCK: I'm here on behalf of the crew, sir.
SKIPPER: Well, spit it out.
CHUCK: The fact is... We'd like you to give Phil another chance.
SKIPPER: Can't do it.
CHUCK: Sir...?
SKIPPER: Close the door. Sit down.
SKIPPER: Why do you think I'm sending him home?
CHUCK: He killed the dolphin.
SKIPPER: The Dolphin was a symptom.
CHUCK: Of what?
SKIPPER: Of a fight he can't win out here.
CHUCK: It's his father sir. He's suffocating him. We've all seen it...
CHUCK: I mean he has all these expectations and he doesn't even know who his own kid is. What right did then have to show up here?
SKIPPER: They have every right Chuck.
CHUCK: They send us because they want us to change, or grow up or something and then they try to keep us the same.
