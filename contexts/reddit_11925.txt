Ex-Friend with Benefits Tried to Kill Himself a Little Over a Week Ago
I'm a sophomore at an extremely conservative Christian college in the Midwest.  I'm not so conservative (though prior to this year I hadn't done anything you can really call scandalous).  Anyway, last semester one of my guy friends asked if I wanted to have a one-night stand, and I said yes.  I was a virgin (which I told him) before that.  Anyway.  He was really nice and we messed around a few more times.

Then over Christmas break he texted me telling me that his therapist said he really shouldn't be messing around (I'd known he was seeing a therapist and that he tried to kill himself and was hospitalized last year).  So of course I didn't want to give him a hard time about that because I mean he's been having a shitty time anyway.

When we got back to school it was pretty awkward though (mostly my fault) but eventually we smoothed things over.  Then after about a month I saw him for an actual conversation for the first time since.  And he told me he'd tried to kill himself again.  I didn't tell the admin (DON'T GIVE ME A LECTURE I SWEAR TO GOD I'VE HEARD LIKE TWENTY ALREADY) but someone did and so he's at the hospital now.  Well he has been over a week and last year he told me he'd been there a week.

I'm worried I guess.  People just keep telling me like "oh don't worry, at least you know he's safe" but it's getting so annoying because YES I KNOW he's physically safe but I don't even want to think about how he's doing emotionally right now.

Is this the part where I tell you that I think my feelings for him (friendship/physical attraction initially) have grown stronger?  I'm just so conflicted.  I feel dumb I guess but I don't regret it at all.  I mostly miss him right now.
