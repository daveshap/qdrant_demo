DICKIE: She was pregnant. Did you know that? Do you know what that means in a place like this?
RIPLEY: I'm prepared to take the blame.
DICKIE: What are you talking about?
RIPLEY: You've been so good to me. You're the brother I never had. I'm the brother you never had.
DICKIE: She came to me for help, she needed money, and I didn't help her. I didn't help her. Now she's dead and it's my fault.
RIPLEY: I'm not going to say anything -- to Marge, or anybody, the police -- It's a secret between us and I'll keep it.
