Does anyone else feel like they deserve to feel depression and feel shitty all the time?
I'm just curious if this is a normal feeling. I might have options to get out of my depression, like certain pills, maybe PMS pills (antidepressants seem to never work but my depression gets 10 times worse around my period) and maybe counseling would work. Maybe these things would work if I tried them again even if they haven't in the past, but for two reasons I haven't(besides cost). First I don't think they'd work or the side effects to meds wouldn't be worth it. But second and perhaps more important idk that I want to get better, I feel like I should live with all the shitty feelings and guilt, like I have to or deserve to. I don't do it for attention, maybe once in my life when I was much more lost, when all this depression started to get bad, but not anymore, I barely even talk about my depression to anyone anymore. Is this normal? Or common? To feel like you deserve misery? Or am I actually just being an attention whore throwing a pity party for herself or something stupid like that? I don't want to be that.
