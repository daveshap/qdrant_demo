LOOSELEAF: You know what gets me? Those guys who went to the moon! To the moon, boy!
HAROLD: Leave me alone! After eight years of horrendously close association, the time has come to part! I crave solitude and time for reflection-- and then a reunion in privacy with my own flesh and blood. You and I may not meet again for months!
LOOSELEAF: Months?
HAROLD: I'm certainly not going to come horning back into your life tomorrow, and I will not welcome your horning back into mine. A chapter has ended. We are old comrades--at a parting of the ways.
LOOSELEAF: I'm lonesome already.
