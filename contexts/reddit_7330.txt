How to get started in the PC/tech repair field?
I've been considering switching careers. I think a phone/PC/tech repair job might be something I could enjoy though. I have had and used computers my whole life, and am generally good at looking at issues and troubleshooting. My experience with hardware itself is lacking, but I have enough cursory knowledge that I think I can pick it up with some training. My OS knowledge is pretty limited to Windows and Android at the moment though. I have a bit of programming knowledge (python, C#, Java, GDscript) but only on a very basic level. And my GoogleFu is strong. What paths for training are there? Would starting out with a corporate outfit like Geek Squad be a good way to get training?
