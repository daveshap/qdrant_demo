JEWELER: Mrs. Langtry, I'm sorry.
MYRA: Why? What's wrong?
JEWELER: You are a valued customer, as you know.
MYRA: But what's wrong?
JEWELER: I can't understand a thing like this. It's something you almost never see.
MYRA: What is?
JEWELER: This is some of the finest filigreed platinum I've ever seen. But the stones, no. They're not diamonds, Mrs. Langtry.
MYRA: But they must be! They cut glass!
JEWELER: Glass will cut glass, Mrs. Langtry. Do you know where it was purchased?
MYRA: It was a gift. It isn't worth anything at all?
JEWELER: Why, of course it is. I can offer you -- well, five hundred dollars.
MYRA: All right.
JEWELER: I'll get you a check.
JEWELER: I hope you're not too badly disappointed with us, Mrs. Langtry.
MYRA: It's not your fault.
JEWELER: You'll give us an opportunity to serve you again, I hope. If there's anything you think we might be interested in...
MYRA: I have only one thing now. Are you interested?
JEWELER: Well, I'd have to see it, of course.
MYRA: You are seeing it. You're looking right at it.
