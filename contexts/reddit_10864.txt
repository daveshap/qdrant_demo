How CAN'T people be depressed
seeing how fucked up and selfish humanity is?
I just can't bare when I point out animal cruelity  or wage slavery or bullshit in religion or bullshit of politics and non depressed people are like "whatever... what can you do... focus on being productive".

Oh yea, PRODUCTIVITY I love that word, it keeps sheeple in a fucking line... Just obey your 33 loving  overlords and then you will get a cookie and a paycheck to paycheck life.
