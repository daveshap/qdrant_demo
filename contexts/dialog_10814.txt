DANA: I'm sure you didn't come here just to talk about art.
VENKMAN: As a matter of fact, I stopped by to tell you that I haven't forgotten your problem and that we're still on the case.
JANOSZ: Dana, aren't you going to introduce me to your friend?
DANA: Oh, I'm sorry. This is Peter Venkman. Peter, Janosz Poha.
JANOSZ: Pleasure to meet you. I've seen you on television.
VENKMAN: How are you? What's that you're working on, Johnny?
JANOSZ: It's a painting I'm restoring for the new Byzantine exhibition. It's a self-portrait of Prince Vigo, the Carpathian. He ruled most of Carpathia and Moldavia in the 17th Century.
VENKMAN: Too bad for the Moldavians.
JANOSZ: 
DANA: He was also a lunatic and a genocidal madman. I hate this painting. I've felt very uncomfortable since they brought it up from storage.
VENKMAN: Yeah, it's not the kind of thing you'd want to hang in the rec room. You know what it needs? A fluffy little white kitten in the corner.
JANOSZ: We don't go around altering valuable paintings, Dr. Venkman.
VENKMAN: Well, I'd make an exception in this case if I were you.
VENKMAN: I'll let you get back to it. Nice meeting you.
JANOSZ: My pleasure.
VENKMAN: I may be wrong, but I think you've got a little crush on this guy.
DANA: Good-bye, Peter.
VENKMAN: I'd like to stay, but I really don't have time to hang around here. I'll call you. Later, Johnny!
STANTZ: Oh good, you're here. Spengler and I have something really amazing to show you.
VENKMAN: It's not that thing you do with your nostrils, is it?
