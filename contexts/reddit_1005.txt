Remember to drink water. Remember to breathe. Remember to stay off social media.
Sending all of you hugs and a reminder to take care of yourself and your loved ones. The little things can be the hardest in the face of all these big scary things. Take a deep breath in, and back out.  
  
You are going to get through this. ðŸ’™
