HELEN: What's keeping you?
MATT: Oh, Charlie again.
HELEN: Say Matt, you haven't done anything about what you saw today, have you?
MATT: Who? Cluett? No, not yet. But I'd like to take a crack at that stiff- necked, horse dollar.[6]
HELEN: Oh now, don't be silly.
MATT: Can you imagine that guy? He was kissing her.
HELEN: Now you've got me worried, dear. Promise me you won't butt in.
MATT: Okay, honey - but just the same I'd like to take a crack at thatâ€”
HELEN: Shh . . . ! I'll wait for you upstairs.
MATT: All right, dear.
MATT: Where you been?
CHARLIE: Where do you think I've been? I took the baby for a stroll in the park.
MATT: What's the matter, Charlie?
CHARLIE: I'm fourteen cents out, and it took me half an hour to find the mistake. And me with a date, too.
MATT: I remember once when your account checked.
CHARLIE: Yeah.
MATT: And listen, wise guy - I'm setting friend time clock for exactly nine o'clock, so no squawks out of you guys in the morning.
CHARLIE: Say, don't annoy me. I got troubles of my own.
CLUETT: Are the payrolls ready for tomorrow?
MATT: Yes, sir.
CLUETT: Let me see your cash book, will you?
MATT: Now?
CLUETT: Yes, now.
