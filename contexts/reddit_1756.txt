Please, reddit, help me find someone I met at SAT testing today
She said she knows of this sub. We were at (redacted) in Philadelphia, originally scheduled for (redacted). Name is Rachel and is applying Ed 1 to (redacted). I was taking lit and Spanish she was taking math 2 and lit. Forgot to get her insta and add her to T20 discord and another discord group.

Edited: Please PM me so I can inv you to the discord for the school I mentioned I was applying ED to

Edited again: redacted some information after being suggested to for privacy. 

Edited: Next day, I have a lot of PMs about the discord from when I was sleeping, which I will get to throughout the day, but the search is still on 

Edited again: looks like we failed boys

FINAL EDIT: IT WORKED

I will update this post if she is found
