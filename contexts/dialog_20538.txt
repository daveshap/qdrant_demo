MARION: How did this... how did I let this happen?
CHARLOTTE: You couldn't have known.
MARION: I should have known... once I would have... I used to be wary... and today I watched my son killed before my eyes... your sister civilized me and I damn myself for having let her...
CHARLOTTE: Thomas is dead but you've done nothing for which you should be ashamed.
MARION: I've done nothing and for that I am ashamed.
CHARLOTTE: If you go, I'll care for them as if they were my own.
MARION: I'll leave in the morning with Gabriel.
