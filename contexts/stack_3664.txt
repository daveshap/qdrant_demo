cross validation for model evaluation I want to use cross validation to validate the results of my model,However, I'm confused how to use it.Should I split my data to 3 sets (Train, Validation,test) and validate the results on test set?or make the validation on the whole data set?or use validation as a training phase and test on the test set?It is good to mention that my dataset is almost 500 records.Thanks
