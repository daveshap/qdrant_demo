Can electric field be restricted? In high school physics, the electric field between a pair of NOT INFINTE paralle plate electrodes exists only between the plates, but now we know there are electric field lines curved out from the edge of the anode plate to the edge of the cathode plate. I am thinking, is there a way to restrict the location of the field so that it only exists at the orientation we want them to? (e.g. so that the electric field can only be detected between the parallel plate electrodes, but not its immediate surroundings)
