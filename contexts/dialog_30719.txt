JOHN SAXON: You're not crazy, by the way.
HEATHER: Thinking I saw Freddy in the grave feels pretty crazy. And jumping in...
JOHN SAXON: You didn't jump in.
HEATHER: That's my memory. And it seemed absolutely real.
JOHN SAXON: Seemed, not was.
HEATHER: It's in my family, you know. My grandmother died in an institution...
JOHN SAXON: Really? Hell, if having a screwy family made you crazy, the world'd be one colossal nuthouse.
HEATHER: I've never mentioned it to him.
JOHN SAXON: Kids know when something's bugging a parent. You've got no idea who this is calling?
HEATHER: Freddy, for all I know.
JOHN SAXON: Steady...
HEATHER: A man, or a boy with a deep, y'know, Freddy voice.
JOHN SAXON: Six weeks of this, and you're surprised you've got Freddy in your dreams? Hell, Sonny Bono says after a while he was seeing his stalker everywhere. Even at Mass.
HEATHER: Really?
JOHN SAXON: Absolutely. And how many times has Letterman called the cops thinking that woman was down in his kitchen again? It gets under your skin if you let it.
HEATHER: You really think Dylan's okay?
