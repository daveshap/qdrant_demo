HILDY: You're so nice, Bruce, you think everybody else is.
BRUCE: Oh, he's not the man for you. I can see that. But I sort of like him. Got a lot of charm.
HILDY: He comes by it naturally. His grandfather was a snake.
BRUCE: If anybody had told me I'd be sitting at lunch with him -- but he swept me right off my feet.
HILDY: That's what he did to me. Swept me right off my feet -- and left me lying on the floor.
