I don’t know where I would be without this sub
I come from a low income school in the “ghetto” where much of the graduating class doesn’t go to college. In my one and only meeting with my high school counselor, he straight up said valedictorian was for guys and salutatorian was for girls. I didn’t even try to stifle my outraged laugh. The majority of our 31 valedictorians last year (its easy to get a 5.0 gpa to prevent competition) were female so idk what world he’s living in. But the point is, I had no access to any information about college until I found this sub. 

I was inspired by the work ethic and ambition of the students here, and I started reading the sub daily for college advice. I learned about the US News rankings, then I learned they were bogus. I learned what college entrance exams were and found r/ACT which helped me study to a 36. I learned about summer programs to apply to, leading me to attend MOSTEC this past summer. I learned about formulating a college list, writing essays, ordering ECs, and presenting an authentic version of myself to colleges. Thanks to this sub, I got into every school I applied to except St. Anford and UC Hicago, including HYPM. I’m happy to say that I will be attending MIT in the fall (assuming this corona thing is over). I want to thank especially u/admissionsmom and u/icebergchick. I would not have come anywhere near this far without this incredibly helpful community!

EDIT: Thanks for the bling, u/smokie_bear! Also, I’ve been thinking more about it, and this sub literally changed the trajectory of my life.
