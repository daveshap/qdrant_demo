On Kubuntu, how do I install my Samsung ML-1640 printer? I installed Kubuntu on my laptop and now I want to install my printer drivers. I tried from System Configuration and by selected printers. Then, my laptop detected my printer, but when I searched for the driver, there was not driver for my printer (ML-1640) in the list.Can you help me to install the packages? I begin with Kubuntu, by the way.Thank you very much,Pierre-Olivier
