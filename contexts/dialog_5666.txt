ROD: Maybe it won't stay in.
STACY: Maybe you better just drive me home.
ROD: Let me just ask you a serious question first.
STACY: What?
ROD: Aren't you worried you could die a virgin?
STACY: Yeah. I'm extremely worried about that. It's right up there with global warming.
ROD: On our way home, a drunken driver could hit us head on and send us flying through the windshield. Terminate us instantly. We'd never experience what it means to make love.
STACY: If sheep don't count.
ROD: That wasn't me ...
STACY: I know. I'm kidding you. Chill out.
ROD: Well I'm trying to be real here and you're mocking me.
STACY: I'm sorry, but you're not going to die a virgin Rod.
