Cannot open files created on windows in ubuntu On my system I am dual booting Windows 10 and Ubuntu 17.10. I also have a third partition where I save files that I then mount when logging on ubuntu. In that partition I also have my onedrive folder. On windows the file is fine and I am able to access all the sub folders. On ubuntu though the file is not recognized and I cannot open it. Anyone knows of any solutions?
