My mom grounded me for getting a 36 on the ACT
My GPA is terrible compared to my ACT so my mom got mad at me and took away my car for the week and grounded me because she says “I wasted my act score since my gpa is bad and I cant get into a ivy” 

If you have an asian mom you’d know that this kind of logic is what we have to deal with daily 😂
