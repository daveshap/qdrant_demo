I'm trying to create a planet with a purple sky, human life on planet not necessary I think that it could be possible with a red sun, and either massive oceans containing algae or a surface covered with active volcanoes. What would my atmosphere be made of, and what color would those oceans/volcanoes appear? Although humans don't need to exist on this planet, they could theoretically discover it and explore.Edit: I know that there is a lot more to color than what the atmosphere is made of. I was wondering more what sort of atmosphere would support either the ocean or volcano theory.
