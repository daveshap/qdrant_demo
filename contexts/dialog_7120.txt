REED: It's just five minutes. She comes in. You wave to the press. She leaves.
DAVE: Yeah, but the First Lady... Couldn't we start with a cousin or something?
REED: She hardly ever sees him and it'll be so fast, she won't have a chance to tell.
BOB: Be a professional. If you can convince her - - you can convince anybody.
DAVE: ... Alright.
BOB: Now when she comes in, we'll move you right out to the balcony. All you have to say is `thanks for doing this, Ellen.'
DAVE: `Thanks for doing this, Ellen.'
