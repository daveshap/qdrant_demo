ESCOBAR: Where is my nephew?
BO CATLETT: Your who?
ESCOBAR: Yayo. Where is he?
ESCOBAR: He's my sister's kid. No papa. Not too bright. Personally, I think he's a retard. I only gave him the job as a favor for my sister, you understand?
BO CATLETT: Sure. Family. I know how that goes.
ESCOBAR: He comes up here with our product. He suppose to come home with five hundred thousand dollars. He never shows up. Meanwhile, my sister's going crazy calling me all the time worried about him. Me, I just wanna know what happened to my focking money.
BO CATLETT: Well, I don't know. I gave the man his money, sent him on his way.
ESCOBAR: You gave him the money?
BO CATLETT: I gave him a key to a locker that had the money in it.
ESCOBAR: Now why would you do that? Put the money in a locker?
BO CATLETT: Because there were a zillion DEA guys hanging around the terminal.
ESCOBAR: A zillion, huh? That's a lot.
BO CATLETT: Maybe your nephew panicked, took off.
ESCOBAR: Where's your partner, the jumpy one? Why isn't he here?
BO CATLETT: He's around someplace.
ESCOBAR: I hear he's around Palm Springs. Dealing our product. Product we sold to you for five hundred thousand dollars. Why do you keep talking to me bullshit? I think maybe I have Ramon and Ceasar staple your tongue to your chin. What do you think?
BO CATLETT: You know, you speak very good English, Mr. Escobar.
ESCOBAR: I went to UC San Diego. We're gonna spend the weekend at the Universal Sheraton. We're gonna take the tour. See the shark. Check out the Miami Vice Action Spectacular. After, we'll come here, get our money.
