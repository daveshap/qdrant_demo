What do I do?
I’m 15 and male, just realized about an hour ago I have a cold sore on my lip (HSV-1). I’ve know for a while that there was a good chance this was going to happen because I found out that a girl that I had more than friendly contact with had it, but I only found out afterwards. So here I am at 15 with fucking oral herpes. I’m at a loss for words because my sex drive is crazy so my friends have been calling me a man whore for years already and this, this is gonna make that all too real. I feel so powerless knowing that I fucked up and there’s nothing I can do to fix it. The only thing now is I really do like that girl and if we can keep it going between us then things will be ok I guess. If you were in my situation what would you do?
