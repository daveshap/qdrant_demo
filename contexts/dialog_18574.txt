NICK: So what's the scenario? Am I saving a princess? Fighting Zombies?
DIFFORD: It changes. There are eleven levels. Each one is a different layer of the ARCADE universe. The concept is, you're entering the video game itself, making your way across the circuit board to the logic core ... ARCADE's brain.
NICK: So how do I start?
DIFFORD: The game will guide you.
