BILL: Ah...
EVE: I have a suggestion. There's really not much time left - I mean, you haven't had a minute alone yet, and - well, I could take care of everything here and meet you at the gate with the ticket... if you'd like.
BILL: I think we'd like very much. Sure you won't mind?
EVE: Of course not.
BILL: She's quite a girl, that what's-her name...
MARGO: Eve. I'd forgotten they grew that way...
BILL: The lack of pretense, that sort of strange directness and understanding-
MARGO: Did she tell you about the Theater and what it meant?
BILL: I told her. I sounded off.
MARGO: All the religions in the world rolled into one, and we're Gods and Goddesses... isn't it silly, suddenly I've developed a big protective feeling for her - a lamb loose in our big stone jungle...
MARGO: Take care of yourself out there...
BILL: I understand they've got the Indians pretty well in hand...
MARGO: Bill...
BILL: Huh?
MARGO: Don't get stuck on some glamour puss-
BILL: I'll try.
MARGO: You're not such a bargain, you know, conceited and thoughtless and messy-
BILL: Everybody can't be Gregory Peck.
MARGO: - you're a setup for some gorgeous wide-eyed young babe.
BILL: How childish are you going to get before you quit it?
MARGO: I don't want to be childish, I'd settle for just a few years-
BILL: And cut that out right now.
MARGO: Am I going to lose you, Bill? Am I?
BILL: As of this moment you're six years old...
