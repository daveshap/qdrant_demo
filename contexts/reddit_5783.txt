I Got Hired!!!
Been graduated from college for about two months, now. I was way late to the game in terms of preparing and so I stuck to this subreddit for advice on interviews, resume writing, etc. I sent an endless amount of applications and received three interviews and got two offers at companies with wonderful benefits and great pay for recent grad! I genuinely don't think I could have done it this quickly without the advice and resources on this sub so thank you r/jobs!!
