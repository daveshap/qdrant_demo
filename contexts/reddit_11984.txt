I hate my class
So in my school, the classes are split. This wouldn't be a problem if the teachers didn't put every single annoying 8th grader in the same class. Basically everyone except for 2 people (my only two friends in my class) are annoying. Every single person just talks and talks and talks all the fucking time. Teacher talking and you want to learn? Well too bad, I'm going to talk all the fucking time during the lesson. Sometime they're even yelling across the class to their friend to tell them a stupid joke. I get headaches during every single lesson because it's so loud and it makes me so god damn tired after every single day. They also almost always pick on a single kid because he has said some regrettable things. Sure, he's kinda weird, but it's not to the extent they ramp it up to be.

Tl:Dr: I hate my class because they're alwatlys talking and picking on one single kid.
