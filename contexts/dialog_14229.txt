POTTER: You wouldn't mind living in the nicest house in town, buying your wife a lot of fine clothes, a couple of business trips to New York a year, maybe once in a while Europe. You wouldn't mind that, would you, George?
GEORGE: Would I? You're not talking to somebody else around here, are you? You know, this is me, you remember me? George Bailey.
POTTER: Oh, yes, George Bailey. Whose ship has just come in –– providing he has brains enough to climb aboard.
GEORGE: Well, what about the Building and Loan?
POTTER: Oh, confound it, man, are you afraid of success? I'm offering you a three year contract at twenty thousand dollars a year, starting today. Is it a deal or isn't it?
GEORGE: Well, Mr. Potter, I . . . I . . . I know I ought to jump at the chance, but I . . . I just . . . I wonder if it would be possible for you to give me twenty-four hours to think it over?
POTTER: Sure, sure, sure. You go on home and talk about it to your wife.
GEORGE: I'd like to do that.
POTTER: In the meantime, I'll draw up the papers.
GEORGE: All right, sir.
