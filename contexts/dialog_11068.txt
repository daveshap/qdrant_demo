FREDO: Oh, 'scuse me.
MICHAEL: It's all right. He stays with me all the time.
FREDO: Oh. Mikey, what's up? I'm totally in the dark.
MICHAEL: We're making an investment in Havana.
FREDO: Great, Havana's great. Lots of activity in Havana! Anybody I know here. Five-Angels? Anybody?
MICHAEL: Johnny Ola... Hyman Roth.
FREDO: I never met them.
MICHAEL: Pentangeli's dead. He was ambushed by the Rosato Brothers. Didn't you know that?
FREDO: No. No, I didn't. Who tells me anything? I been kept in the dark so long, I'm getting used to it.
MICHAEL: I want you to help me, Fredo.
FREDO: That's what I'm here for.
MICHAEL: Tonight I want to relax with you. The Senator from Nevada is here with some people from Washington. I want to show them a good time in Havana.
FREDO: Count on me; that's my specialty.
MICHAEL: I'd like to come along. There's been a lot of strain, and I've been cooped up in this room for three days.
FREDO: Me and you, great! Gimme an hour to wash my face and do my research and we'll have these Washington suckers right where you want 'em. Poor Frankie Five-Angels. He always wanted to die in bed...with a broad.
