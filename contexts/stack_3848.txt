Which statistical test would you suggest I use? I'll try to keep my question as short as I can:For my study I will include 30-40 patients. For each patient, I will already have retrospective data for creatinine, a substance found in urine and blood.I will look at the variance in the retrospective creatinine measurements. So for example they might have had 3 urine creatinine measurements in the past: 9,2 ; 6,8 and 8,0. I will apply an intervention to each patient, in the hope to reduce the variance of these values. (for example post-study it would then be 9,2 ; 8,9 and 9,0). So the setup is pre- and post intervention. The goal is to see whether the intervention decreased the variance in found values pre-post. I also want to measure the variance within group. After a lot of (confusing) research I am considering taking the standard deviation of the pre and post values, and then employing a paired T-test. I'm not sure if thats a good way to do it, what is your opinion?  The substance is normally distributed.Your thoughts would be very much appreciated.Regards, Daniel
