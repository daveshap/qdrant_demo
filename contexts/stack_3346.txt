Book (series?) in which a word defeats a dark lord/evil king I have remembered a middle-grade book (series?) that I'd read probably around 4th-6th grade. These are all the details I can remember:It was a medieval fantasy esque setting.It featured a world with some sort of king or dark lord that the protagonist was trying to defeat - for some reason, I don't remember why, this king was almost undefeatable. He could only be defeated by a secret word.Parts of the secret word were scattered around the land in syllables.The book begun with an ominous prologue in which a character had finally gathered all the parts of the word, and confronted the king - I think he might've been captured or something like that, and was brought before the king. When he said the word, it didn't work. I don't remember perfectly, but it might've been because the 'king' was an imposter, staged there to make the person say it and then the real king would come out.After saying the word, the person who said it immediately forgets it.
