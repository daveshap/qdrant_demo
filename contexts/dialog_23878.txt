MERRILL: For the kids protection. All they were doing was watching TV from five a.m. I felt like they were getting obsessed like you said. They should be playing furry, furry rabbit or tea party or something right?
GRAHAM: What's furry, furry rabbit?
MERRILL: That's a game isn't it? Anyway... There's been some interesting developments.
GRAHAM: What time is it?
MERRILL: Eleven a.m. They're gone.
