Fuck covid I’m in the negatives and I want to puke
I’m not working due to covid. I’m doing freelance deliveries but it’s been dying down and I don’t get my money until Tuesday. 
I’m living check by check, I had been negative a couple of dollars in my bank account and had a credit card payment due. I am extremely anal about not missing a payment. I panicked but scavenged enough of my collected cash tips together to just barely get me out of negative and to pay the minimum due. Then a freaking reoccuring monthly fee I forgot about hit and drained my account back into the negatives and then I got slapped with an overdraft fee and I just woke up to -$70.
I don’t get any form of money until Tuesday. I think I’m going to puke. All of my cards are essentially maxed out trying to get by, I just got accepted into my dream school but I have tuition deposit due in a few days that’s a couple hundred dollars and then semester tuition due in a few weeks, plus textbooks, etc etc I just want to curl into a ball and scream and cry
