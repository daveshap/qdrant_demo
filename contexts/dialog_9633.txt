SONDRA: You're so witty. I'm so jealous... I <u>need</u> to get out of here, Jack, and do something other than sit in this apartment and count how many funny lines you have per page.
JACK: You know, tomorrow's a very big day for me... It would be nice if you acted like you understood.
SONDRA: Fine. I'll say no.
JACK: They're putting me on film tomorrow.
SONDRA: Fine.
JACK: ... First time in my life I'll be a voice with a body. Do you know what that means? What this could lead to?
SONDRA: Jack, it's a sitcom -- you're not defining Pi.
JACK: I'll remember that the next time you get excited by drawing pubic hairs on raisin bran. Want some?
SONDRA: No, I have to work.
JACK: How un-sixties of you.
SONDRA: I was nine in the sixties.
