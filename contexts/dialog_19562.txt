EVIL SCIENTIST: What trail are you trying to throw me off now?
SALLY: Nothing. W-w-what are you talking about?
EVIL SCIENTIST: Taste it.
SALLY: But why? It's <u>your</u> lunch. There isn't much there in the first place.
EVIL SCIENTIST: Taste it.
SALLY: No.
EVIL SCIENTIST: Why not?
SALLY: I'm not hungry. What's wrong? I spent all morning on that soup. I thought you liked Worm's Wart.
EVIL SCIENTIST: There's nothing more suspicious than Worm's Wart -- it distracts one from every other taste and smell.
