Didnâ€™t get the job, but recruiter invited me to stay in contact. Is this just a nice thing to say to a rejected candidate or should I actually try to stay in contact?
The title really says it all, I think they really did like me but I do lack experience because of just getting out of college and only having 2 small internships under my belt. Should I email the recruiter back and ask if I can add her on LinkedIn?
