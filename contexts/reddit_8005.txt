Grad school under reporting costs by $8k+
I’m in a competitive medical program that requires a certain amount of clinical/immersion hours. The program itself is fairly expensive and many of us are using a combination of traditional loans to pay for the courses and grad plus loans to help supplement our income and pay for living expenses etc as it is nearly impossible to work full time and maintain the grade point average required to stay in the program.  Our financial aid also does not include our summer courses even though the amount of courses over the summer is considered full time by federal guidelines (over 6 credits considered full time and our summer courses average 9-10.) I spoke with financial aid about the summer courses and they had no idea that the traditional loans don’t cover them.

We just had a meeting to discuss the process of signing up for and paying for (!) immersion hours which costs $8,000 and is not covered by financial aid. I think this is unfair and ultimately our school is under reporting the cost of attendance by tens of thousands of dollars per year (including summer course) and doesn’t report this cost for immersion hours. 

This school is in an already expensive state with a high cost of living and state and federal income tax so working part time doesn’t cover all that much in the way of expenses. Lots of hospitals offer something in the way do education costs but it is not competitive and many offer less than $2k per year (less if you’re full time.)

I’m trying to figure out what my best course of action is.  The vast majority of us in the program are taking out loans but they basically don’t cover the cost of tuition because the school isn’t reporting accurately. 

Has anyone dealt with the situation or just have advice in moving forward?
