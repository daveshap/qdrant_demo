JOE: Well, here's where the fun never stops!
SEYMOUR: Yeah, I'm really, really happy. Really having a good time.
JOE: Still torturing yourself over that Enid, huh?
SEYMOUR: Where else am I ever going to find another girl who likes Geeshie Wiley records? She could at least have the decency to call me back.
JOE: Maybe she was just using you to try and get back at some guy. Who knows? It could be a million things. It's wasted time trying to logically figure out the female brain, that's for sure.
JOE: Maybe she's got another boyfriend.
SEYMOUR: Yeah, well... thanks for cheering me up.
JOE: No problem.
