Access from external network safely to raspberry I am implementing a home alarm system with raspberry and I need to access it from the external network. The initial idea was to use cascade VPN and ssh (in my university to connect to the cluster I had to first connect to the University network and then use ssh). But if via VPN I connect to the raspberry address then I cannot give commands via ssh because I'm in 'local', no? ... So I should either use ssh more fail2ban or use VPN. But could I be calm with one of these two methods? Can I use ACL somewhere? It would not be nice if someone could open the gate or access the cameras...
