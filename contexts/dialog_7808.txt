MS. HELLER: Baby, I'm going to spend the morning at the mall. You know, shop for Waikiki. Honey, what are you looking for?
PRINCIPAL COLLINS: The chest! The chest that I put my papers in.
MS. HELLER: What papers?
PRINCIPAL COLLINS: The documents. The photos! The tapes! The evidence.
MS. HELLER: The evidence of what?
PRINCIPAL COLLINS: Sweetheart keep up with me for half a minute. The evidence of every scam we ever pulled. The evidence that's going to put us away for twenty years.
MS. HELLER: Where is it?
PRINCIPAL COLLINS: I don't know where it is. It's not here. It's been stolen.
MS. HELLER: Wait a minute, I think I know who stole it.
PRINCIPAL COLLINS: No you don't know who stole it. Just let me do the thinking.
MS. HELLER: It was Jessica. That girl who tried to follow me on the field trip.
PRINCIPAL COLLINS: JESSICA. Are you sure?
MS. HELLER: She's been snooping around a lot, asking questions.
PRINCIPAL COLLINS: Okay, I'll take care of Jessica.
MS. HELLER: Are you going to kill her?
PRINCIPAL COLLINS: Why don't you see to it the kids are ready for the parade tomorrow. I have to pay somebody a little visit.
