GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER: Let me worry about that, Major. I've still got my red line to the Air Command.
MAJOR MANDRAKE: That's right, sir.
GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER: We don't want to be vulnerable to saboteurs calling up and pretending to be different people from the President down, do we?
MAJOR MANDRAKE: You're right, sir.
GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER: No calls from inside out. No calls from outside in are even answered. No calls.
MAJOR MANDRAKE: I understand, sir. Nothing comes or goes without your personal say-so.
GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER: No calls at all. With or without my say-so. My voice can be imitated too, Major.
MAJOR MANDRAKE: Yes, sir. I just thought of something, sir. How do I know I'm talking to you now?
GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER: Who do you think you're talking to?
MAJOR MANDRAKE: To you, sir. But how do I know?
GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER: Are you trying to be insubordinate?
MAJOR MANDRAKE: No, sir.
GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER: I hope not. Now, as soon as you do what I told you, have Plan-R radioed to the Wing.
MAJOR MANDRAKE: Plan-R????
GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER: Are you hard of hearing, Major?
MAJOR MANDRAKE: No, sir. Plan-R to be radioed to the Wing.
GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER: As soon as you've done that, shut down the communications center. Lock it up and assign the personnel to base security details.
MAJOR MANDRAKE: General Ripper, if I shut down the communi- cations center, there'll be no radio or teleprinter contact with Air Command head- quarters or anyone, for that matter.
GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER: Are you questioning my orders, Major?
MAJOR MANDRAKE: No, sir. I'm just bringing the facts to your attention, sir.
GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER: You're a good officer, Major, and you're perfectly right to bring these facts to my attention.
MAJOR MANDRAKE: Thank you, sir.
GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER: Now, as soon as you've done that, double- up on all base security teams. Our enemies are plenty smart, and there might even be an attack on the base by saboteurs.
MAJOR MANDRAKE: Yes, sir.
GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER: And lastly, all privately owned radios are to be immediately impounded. They can be used to issue instructions to saboteurs. Air Police will have lists of all owners.
LT. TOEJAM: Hey, King. Somebody at Burpelson has a very perverted sense of humor.
MAJOR KONG: Yeah?
LT. TOEJAM: I just got another blast on the CRM-114, and the damned thing decodes: Wing Attack, Plan-R.
