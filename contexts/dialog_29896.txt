LEO: Someone who knows how to clean knows where the object was before she started cleaning and then that object goes back to its exact same spot. Shelly, I know where everything in this house is. Sometimes on the road I mentally go through this whole house and picture where every item is.
SHELLY: Lay off the bennies, Leo.
LEO: Anybody can clean the surface of an object, but dirt can find its way anywhere. To really clean, you have to scrub below the surface. WHERE THE DIRT IS, SHELLY.
LEO: That's one thing you are going to learn, Shelly, -- HOW TO CLEAN. It takes scrubbing, Shelly. There is no easy way. THIS IS WHERE WE LIVE, SHELLY.
SHELLY: As if I didn't know.
LEO: I'm going to show you how to wash this tile and then you're going to do it.
SHELLY: Come off it, Leo. I'm late for work...
LEO: What did you say?
