BARNES: Elias - you take your squad and I'll take Tex and Francis from your squad. We move out in two-zero mikes.
ELIAS: I thought it was O'Neill's turn tonight.
O'NEILL: Shit! Morehouse and Sal are short. Fu Sheng's going on R&R, you don't want to send their asses out on an ambush. You got the fresh meat Elias.
ELIAS: They don't know shit Barnes, and chances are we gonna run into something.
O'NEILL: So what am I going to do! Get one of my guys zapped so some fuckface fresh from the World can get his beauty fucking sleep!
ELIAS: Hey O'Neill why don't you cool it, you don't have to be a prick everyday of your life, you know.
O'NEILL: Fuck you Elias.
