JOHNNIE: I thought you two were in Austin, Texas. Or Takes-us, as they say in these parts.
DROP SHADOW: We were. Now Mr. San Pedro Sula and I are on our way back to Utila, in the morning.
REGGIE: Would you like to enjoy a martini with us?
JOHNNIE: Why not? How was the fishin'?
REGGIE: I think they are too serious, these American fishermen. In Honduras, we are not so concerned with the method.
JOHNNIE: So, it's back to the islands.
DROP SHADOW: Yes. Mr. San Pedro Sula spoke yesterday to his son, Archibald Leach San Pedro Sula, who is named after Cary Grant, and he told them there was a shooting.
REGGIE: Teddy Roosevelt, one of the local shrimp boat captains is in jail now. These people are friends of mine, so I must return and find out what happened.
JOHNNIE: This island of yours sounds like a kind of unpredictable place.
REGGIE: It has its moments of uncertainty.
DROP SHADOW: But how are you finding New Orleans, Senor Farragut?
JOHNNIE: Call me Johnnie... N.O. has always been a good town to sit around in.
