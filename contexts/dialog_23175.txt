DETECTIVE KINCAID: Whoever it is, now is taking credit for Maureen Prescott's murder.
GALE: But we know who killed Maureen Prescott, Billy Loomis and Stu Macher. I mean, they even told Sidney how they did it!
DETECTIVE KINCAID: Yeah, but, if I'm not mistaken, you said in your book that Sidney got it wrong before. She accused Cotton Weary of murdering her mother, and he was sent away for it! Maybe there is a third killer. Sidney Might know something
DEWEY: I told you, I don't know where Sidney is. And even if there was a third killer, Sidney doesn't know about it.
DETECTIVE KINCAID: That is for me to decide. I need to talk to her Mr. Riley, she is a key element in this case. I have a press conference in an hour, and I need to explain why there are four dead celebrities.
GALE: Four? There are five.
DETECTIVE KINCAID: Ben Damon. Christine Perkins. Sarah Darling. Tom Prinze. That's four, last time I learned how to count.
DEWEY: What about Angelina Tyler? She was there too.
DETECTIVE KINCAID: Police are still searching through the debris. Could be days before we find her . . . that is, if she's even there.
GALE: OK, look. We all know that this has something to do with 'Stab 3'. What we do not know is why the killer keeps leaving articles about Maureen Prescott.
DETECTIVE KINCAID: Actually, there was more this time. This time, we found a picture too.
