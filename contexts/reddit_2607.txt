Had a video interview this week and did not like the hiring manager (or the job, really). They have advanced me to another round of interviews. How do I politely decline with the hope to possibly find a job somewhere else in the company?
I know I shouldn’t turn down a job or an interview during these times, but the hiring manager was arrogant and seemed more toxic than my current manager. I am interested in the company, but not working for him or this specific role. It is a large company. TIA!
  
EDIT: the hiring manager WOULD be my direct boss. Does that change anyone’s opinion? Just curious.
