ARTEMUS: J. S. Bach.
JIM: Jim West.
ARTEMUS: Artemus Gordon. Bach, he's the composer.
JIM: I don't mind him, but who the hell are you... my valet or something?
ARTEMUS: Valet? You jest of course. I am a U.S. Marshal.
JIM: Funny. So am I.
ARTEMUS: Congratulations. Unfortunately, my train is about to leave, and I really must insist you disembark.
JIM: Your train? Listen, friend, you're obviously lost. ... I've got orders here to take possession of this train and to investigate a certain crime.
ARTEMUS: Interesting. Mine say the same thing, and they don't mention you, not even as a valet, although we could talk...
JIM: Just another bureaucratic foul-up. You know how these pencil-pushers are. So, why don't you just run on back and explain what happened?
ARTEMUS: Funny, I was just thinking you should do the same. Since I am already in residence, and am obviously the man for the job, it's been grand making your acquaintance, sir. And best of luck in all your future endeavors.
JIM: You're quite the wordsmith, fiddle boy. But nobody smooth-talks his way into my assignment.
ARTEMUS: If you're implying our little imbroglio has reached an impasse whose only resolution can be found in a more primitive fashion, then I for one am fully prepared to do so... al fresco.
