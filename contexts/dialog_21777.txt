JOEY: Stick out your hands, Jake.
JAKE: C'mon, Joey.
JOEY: G'wan, do it. Protect yourself, rummy.
JOEY: See? That's all there was to it.
JAKE: What the fuck they want? I took the dive. They want me to fall down too? I don't fall down for nobody. I never went down in my life. Joey, what do I gotta do? Crawl on my hands and knees? I made an asshole of myself in the fuckin' Garden! All the newspaper writers make fun of me. I'm the bum of the year. All I want is a shot. Just a fuckin' shot. What do I gotta do? I'll do anything.
JOEY: Except fall down like a normal person.
JAKE: Yeah, except fall down. That's right.
JOEY: All right, you don't wanna fall down, so now you gotta take a rest. So, you enjoy the suspension. 'Cause there's nothin' you can do about it. Let the Commissioner and the D.A. jerk you around. So you wait.
JAKE: Jesus Christ! Seven months! What am I gonna do for seven months? I'm gonna go crazy. How do I keep my strength? By that time I'll be too weak to win the title. And my weight? Forget about it -- I'm gonna blow up like a balloon. I ain't never gonna hold my weight down. Seven months! I don't know...
JOEY: We did what we had to do. Tommy don't forget. Sooner or later you'll get your shot -- if Tommy don't die.
