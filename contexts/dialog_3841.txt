NYSSA: Each day is a little life.
BLADE: What?
NYSSA: Each day is a little life. Every waking and rising a little birth
NYSSA: Anyone else make it?
BLADE: I don't think so.
NYSSA: Thank you.
BLADE: For what?
NYSSA: It would've been easy for you to let me die back there today, but you didn't.
BLADE: I wouldn't read too much into it.
BLADE: You don't want to go there.
NYSSA: Why?
BLADE: Because one of us is going to kill the other before this ends.
NYSSA: It doesn't have to be like that. We don't have to be enemies.
BLADE: Get real. I was useful to Damaskinos as long as the hunt was still on. Now that it's over, all bets are off.
NYSSA: If that's true, then why'd you save me?
NYSSA: Why do you hate us so much?
BLADE: I am a hunter. A weapon. It's what I do. It's in my blood.
NYSSA: Well it's in mine, too. I'm a pureblood. I wasn't turned. I was born this way. Just like you. Am I evil because I want to survive? What about a wolf? What about any predator?
