People who say “it’s a bad day, not a bad life” are the fucking worst
It IS a bad life. Do you rly think I wanna kill myself bc I had one bad day? Fuck no. It’s because every single day of my life is a battle. Every step, every blink, every breath takes so much willpower. 

Depression can’t even be cured. People say it’s “not logical” to kill your self, but it really is for me at least. It WONT get better. Depression can only be suppressed. I’ll have to live with this horrible pain for the rest of my life. And the things in my life that make it worse are even more unbearable because they’ll NEVER go away, no matter what some fucking stranger who doesn’t even know what I’ve been through says. 

So don’t say any of those shallow ass phrases. If ur gonna say those then get OUT of here bc ur just making things worse.
