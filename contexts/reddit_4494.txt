Does anyone else experience an “Itching Soul” symptom?
When my anxiety and depression is really bad I have this strange sensation that I can’t quite describe. It’s like experiencing the emotional part of having an itch - though nothing actually itches, and nothing to scratch to relieve it. I call it an itchy soul. Does anyone else know what I’m talking about?
