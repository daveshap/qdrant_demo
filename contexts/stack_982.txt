Ubuntu boots to black screen after Update to Ubuntu 18 I have just tried to upgrade my Ubuntu to Ubuntu 18, and at one moment I had to choose if it should install new version of a certain file or keep the old one, and I selected to see the difference. After which, I didn\u00b4t know how to close the window and return to upgrade so I pressed  Ctrl+X which terminated the process completely. At first I could continue using Linux without any problems, but after I rebooted,  it started making problems.<br>It shows a black screen where I can move with my mouse, but I can\u00b4t do anything else.  So I looked up online what I can do about it, and after trying everything with Booting in recovery mode, I have decided to install a new version of Ubuntu, while keeping the old data on the drive. But it seems that was not the solution either.  Any ideas ?
