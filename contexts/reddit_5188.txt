How should I decline a job offer?
I was emailed out of the blue about a position at another company (I was originally eager to work for a while back) that was open a couple days ago and they answered my questions.  They said if I was interested, they will give me a contract to read.  Over time I didn't really find the answer I like.  But after consideration, I've decided I am not ready to work for this company as I already have another job but not ready to take on the tasks of being a contractor job, which I would not be working as a company but a self employment.  So should I politely reject by email or by calling them?
