CRUZ: Other than we had so much fun the last time we worked together. You gonna tell me why you're comin' to me instead of the FBI?
KAREN: I report to the FBI, first thing they're gonna do is ask me to go get some coffee.
CRUZ: You know, I'm not in homicide any more.
KAREN: No, I didn't know that.
CRUZ: Yeah, I'm crimes against persons and property now, also sex crimes and child abuse.
KAREN: Detroit, you must be pretty busy.
CRUZ: Yeah, and, as you can see, home invasions are big, too.
KAREN: Listen, Raymond, a year ago, DEA had this guy Glenn Michaels on possession with intent but couldn't make it stick. In his statement, Glenn said he went up to Detroit to visit a friend and look into job opportunities -- if you can believe that.
CRUZ: Who was the friend?
KAREN: Guy named Maurice Miller, also known as Snoopy, a former prizefighter.
CRUZ: Christ, I know Snoopy Miller. He's a fuckin' wackjob thinks he's Sugar Ray Leonard. Hangs out with a couple other Grade-A nutcases over on the West side.
KAREN: I'll need a last known address.
CRUZ: That's fine, but I don't want you to talk to Miller alone.
KAREN: Come on, Raymond, I'm a federal officer, I'm armed.
