JACK: The Royal.
FRANK: Right. The Royal. When's the last time we were there?
JACK: Couple years.
FRANK: February?
JACK: April.
FRANK: Right. It's incredible how you do that. Remember things.
JACK: A useless talent.
FRANK: Drove me crazy when we were kids. The way you never looked at the music. Miss Simpson would just play it and ...
JACK: They were simple songs.
FRANK: Not for me. I still have to look at the music sometimes, you know that? Otherwise, I forget. I just forget. But you. You never forget. Ever. So how come you couldn't remember Ma's birthday?
JACK: I told you. It's a useless talent.
FRANK: God, the old man would've loved this view, wouldn't he?
JACK: Yeah.
FRANK: I always think of him on New Year's. How he used to pour us each half a can of beer. Remember?
JACK: You always threw up.
FRANK: Yeah, and you drank yours like it was orange juice. He loved that about you.
JACK: He was just having fun.
FRANK: It was like you'd passed some test, you know?
JACK: It was just a can of beer, Frank.
FRANK: Yeah, but he told you things. He never told me anything. Even though I was the oldest. It was always you two, running off, doing things together.
JACK: You could've come.
FRANK: I could've. But he didn't want me to.
JACK: You're making things up, Frank.
FRANK: Maybe so. You ever go back there? Where it happened.
