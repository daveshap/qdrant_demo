Does the ground wire for my pool connect to the pumps? I am in the midst of a new gunite in-ground pool install.  I have the electrical background to tackle this job but I want to know I have it right, particularly around the bonding and grounding.  I got the homeowners one time electrical permit.I successfully obtained the initial bond permit after the rebar was laid out.  I ran #8 bare copper around and left my 4 tails above the pool.  I also ran a #8 bare copper from the bonding lugs on the 3 pool lights I have installed and left them tailed out.  I have now laid out the 3ft wide copper grid to go under my pavers.  I will connect my tails(4 rebar bonds and 3 lights) to the grid and then run a solid bare #8 from the grid back to my equipment pad. Does this #8 go to one or all pumps I have at the pad and their ground lugs?  Ill have a sub panel outside.  Will I still need another grounding stick for this subpanel? I have also read I need to run a solid, insulted #8 from each light, in addition to the ground wire that comes with the light.  Is that right?  Do I need to bond the inside of the light too?  This is where I am confused.
