Friend groups really be succeeding together
So, my best friend got into Columbia yesterday. While we were screaming in her car and filming a really bad decision video, I was busy posting a cute little photo on my Instagram story of her. Scrolling through, I see many people, close friends of mine that go to different schools, people I did programs with, all doing the same thing. In 20 minutes on my phone, I saw six people going to Harvard. Three going to Princeton, five going to Duke. I have a friend who was accepted to Emory yesterday, and one to Notre dame qb.  I know personally three people going to NYU and two going to Stanford. And every single one I smiled bright and was super excited to text them holy hell you’re going to ______!!

This is my favorite part of the process. Getting to see the amazing people I know get what they deserve, the acceptances they worked so hard for. It’s amazing.
It hurt a lot to see some my friends got rejected from their dream schools. But, I know that in a year, it won’t matter. They’ll be happy. They’ll be living it up somewhere. And in the end, I am so proud of all of them.

edit: okay so I got into notre dame
