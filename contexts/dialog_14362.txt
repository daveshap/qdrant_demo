JEZZIE: It's still there, Jake. Even if you never say a word about it. You can't spend two years in Vietnam ...
JACOB: What does that have to do with anything? Does it explain the barricaded subway stations? Does it explain those Godforsaken creatures?
JEZZIE: New York is filled with creatures. Everywhere. And lots of stations are closed.
JACOB: They're like demons, Jez.
JEZZIE: Demons, Jake? Come on. They're winos and bag ladies. Low life. That's all they are. The streets are crawling with 'em. Don't make em into somethin' they're not. It's the pressure, honey. That's all it is.
JACOB: Those guys tried to kill me tonight. They were aiming right at me.
JEZZIE: Kids on a joy ride. Happens all the time.
JACOB: They weren't human!
JEZZIE: Come on. What were they, Jake?
