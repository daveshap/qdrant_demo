DOYLE: Hey Freddy, what's goin' on boy. I seen your pitcher in the paper for catchin' that big-ass bass.
FREDDY: Yeah She was a big 'un. You ain't drunk drivin' are you Doyle?
DOYLE: Yeah.
FREDDY: I figured that. Well you better be careful with that cripple in the back. You'll throw him out. Looks like you got a wagonful.
DOYLE: We run outta somethin' to drink. Goin' to the county line. You want to race?
FREDDY: You know better than that. We're on duty. Catch me in that Camaro next week one night.
DOYLE: Catch you later Freddy!
DOYLE: I bet you like sittin' between two men in a dual wheel truck don't you?
VAUGHAN: Oh, yeah, I'm thrilled.
DOYLE: Sarcastic right? You know the boys in the band are probably gonna stay over tonight. We'd be glad to have you.
