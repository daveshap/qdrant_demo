MARYLIN: As you are well aware, my previous marriage ended with an unjustified strain on my reputation My motives were questioned. I was slandered in court.
DOYLE: You did good, Massey!
MARYLIN: Therefore in an effort to remove any trace of suspicion from my sweet Howard -- I wish to execute a pre- nuptial agreement.
DOYLE: And -- there's no talking her out of it. Believe me, I've tried.
MARYLIN: They say the Massey pre-nup has never been penetrated.
DOYLE: She said penetrate." Heh heh heh."
MILES: Oh, for the love of...
MARYLIN: That is true, isn't it Miles? Your pre-nup is the best there is?
MILES: That is correct. Not to blow my own horn, but they devote an entire semester to it at Harvard Law.
DOYLE: Harvard? Whoa, Daddy!
MILES: I just want to make sure that you both --
MILES: -- understand what you're asking for here. The Massey pre-nup provides that in the event of a dissolution of the marriage for any reason, both parties shall leave it with whatever they brought in, and earned during. No one can profit from the marriage. The pre-nup protects the wealthier party.
DOYLE: Well -- at the moment, that'd be me.
MILES: And without it, that party is exposed -- a sitting duck. No wriggle room.
DOYLE: A Wriggle Room! Maybe we should put that in the Malibu house. Screw the screening room!
MILES: -- and we are sure...
MILES: -- we are both sure that's what we want?
MARYLIN: Absolutely.
DOYLE: Course I can't do much wriggling" if you tie me up like that again. Massey -- this is one bad bad little girl."
MARYLIN: We'd better go before we get thrown out.
MILES: Excuse me, Mr. Doyle, if I could just borrow your charming fiancee for a moment.
DOYLE: What part?
MILES: I'd just like to have a word with her.
DOYLE: Why not? I'm going to have her for a lifetime.
