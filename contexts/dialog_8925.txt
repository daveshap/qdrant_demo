FRANK: We were just having a little discussion about morality.
SUSIE: Some discussion.
FRANK: I just saw a man walk out of your room!
JACK: You saw wrong.
FRANK: Huh?
JACK: He's with the hotel. I called him.

JACK: We had a leak in the bathroom. He fixed it.
FRANK: He was wearing a suit.
JACK: He had to come quickly. It was a big leak.
FRANK: How come I didn't hear anything?
JACK: You're a heavy sleeper, Frank. You've always-been a heavy sleeper. Unlike me.
FRANK: I guess I ... If I jumped to...
SUSIE: Forget it.
