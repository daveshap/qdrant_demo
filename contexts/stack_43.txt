Installing SSD to non retina 2012 macbook pro via recovery menu I have a 13\" 2012 non-retina MacBook Pro that I intend on upgrading with a Samsung Evo 850 SSD. I have watched some tutorials and for the most part, I think I know what to do on the hardware side of things but I have two questions for the software side after the disk has been successfully installed. Question 1. Can I use the recovery menu (accessed by hitting command + r on boot) to both format, and install a version of MacOS? Question 2. If so, do I need to initialize the disk before installing it? Or can I literally unbox the SSD, install it in my MBP, and then format/install MacOS via recovery?
