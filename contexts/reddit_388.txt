Making time for a relationship
So me and this girl (both freshman) have been hanging out for a while, since a little before Christmas. We both like eachother for sure, but ive been kinda waiting to ask her out because I don't really know how it would work out. I've got daily sports including weekends year round. Afterwards I'm always kinda wrecked so we've only been able to hang out once or twice a week. 

If we start dating, is only hanging out outside of school a couple times a week an ok amount? Would I have to drop some things to make more time?
 
Clearly I'm not the only kid to have daily sports, I'm just inexperienced with all this. Thanks.
