How to integrate a pre-FTL and a pre-sapient civilization in the same system into your Stellaris empire? I have a system within my borders that has both a pre-sapient civilization and a pre-FTL civilization. I'd like to integrate both of them into my empire. I know I can uplift the pre-FTL civ and then integrate them after a while, but I worry that if I uplift it, it will settle the pre-sapient life form's planet.Can I give them sapience and then advance one or the other without them fighting?
