PRICE: Right here, Mr. Pritchett. As well as five other bona fide, bank drafts for one million dollars each. Made out to cash.
EDDIE: And we get this money when?
PRICE: The second the sun hits tomorrow morning. Assuming you have stayed the entire night - and you're still alive, of course. Any other questions?
SARA: Yeah. Why's there five checks? There's only four of us.
PRICE: You're forgetting my lovely wife; she's part of the same winner-take-all as the rest of you.
SARA: What're you talking about?
PRICE: Oh, sorry. Detail I guess I forgot to mention. You die, you lose. Your check gets divvied-up by those still amongst the living.
BLACKBURN: What are you playing here, Price?
PRICE: A very, very scary game. But then look at the bright side: if there's only one of you still upright at dawn, you'll be leaving here with five million dollars in your pocket.
EDDIE: This is nuts.
PRICE: Yeah. But, hey, anybody who's not comfortable" with the rules
PRITCHETT: I'm ready now.
PRICE: Alright, Mr. Pritchett, let me just sign the damn thing.
