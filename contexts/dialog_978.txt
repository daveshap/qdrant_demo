DE VRIES: C'mon, man. One more sweep.
GUTTIEREZ: One more sweep... one more sweep. I'm getting tired of one more fuckin' sweep. We're been lookin' for this thing for three days now, and found zip.
DE VRIES: Ah, quit griping. Keeps you in shape doesn't it?
GUTTIEREZ: Hey! I was in shape before we started doing this.
