ENID: Hi. Look, I'm kind of tired - I think I'll go to bed.
DAD: I made spaghetti. Do you want some?
ENID: I-I really have to get up early for class tomorrow.
MAXINE: It's really quite something to see you all grown up like this, Enid. I'd love to hear about what you're doing. I can't help but feel that I had some small part in how you turned out... What are you studying? You were always such a smart little girl.
ENID: I'm taking a remedial high school art class for fuck-ups and retards.
