MISS WOLLSTEN: I'm a woman -- a lonely woman. I have few friends.
GENERAL: Yes?
MISS WOLLSTEN: I have not had a happy life --but that one thing - - that terror which brings me awake out of deep sleep —- I want to avoid it.
GENERAL: I don't understand you.
MISS WOLLSTEN: I don't want to be buried alive. If I die I want to be sure —- quite sure.
GENERAL: If you should fall sick we'll be careful. You need not worry.
MISS WOLLSTEN: No, I want more than that. I beg you General, make sure --drive a knife through my heart -- anything.
GENERAL: You ask that of me? You're afraid to live in your coffin. You know what that means?
MISS WOLLSTEN: That's superstition. That's something out of old tales -- about the dead who live —- I'm talking of something else --cataleptic attacks -- apparent death that is not real.
GENERAL: Never fear -- when you are dead you will remain dead. I will see to it that you do not walk about again. I promise you that. There is another one here who can not die. I will watch you both. Never fear.
