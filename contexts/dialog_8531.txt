LEIA: I don't know what he's talking about.
HAN: Ooops! I guess you haven't told Luke about that yet.
LUKE: About what?
HAN: Now don't get the wrong idea, pal. She was just trying to express her true feelings for me.
LEIA: You must have gone completely out of your feeble mind.
HAN: Come on, your highness, are you telling me you haven't been thinking about that kiss?
LEIA: Why you low-down, stuck-up, half- witted, scruffy-looking nerf-herder.
HAN: Who's scruffy-looking? I tell ya' sweetheart, I must've hit pretty close to the mark to get you hoppin' like this. Doesn't it look that way to you, Luke?
