GARY: When you get to a certain age, you start wondering. About your legacy. I doubt you even remember Outpost 1.0 --
MILO: I do!
GARY: Yeah? I wanna feel like I did when I wrote that. But I'm 42, that's 100 in cyber-years. I look at you and see the things that got me here. But somehow got away.
MILO: If my dad'd leveled with me like that even once... The weird thing is, my fantasy he could somehow be like the old Gary? It's his fantasy, too.
ALICE: I think that's great, Milo. I do.
MILO: ...But?
ALICE: Didn't you visit the campus?
MILO: I forgot. That's why you have to help me decide.
ALICE: No way. You have this -- destiny.
MILO: C'mon, I wouldn't have a destiny without you. My destiny would be dying at 20. From eating --
ALICE: Don't bring that up. Like a different girlfriend would'd've let you die?
MILO: You saved my life in alot of ways.
