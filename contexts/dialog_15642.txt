KELLY: I'm not making it up.
JACK: Well. You don't have to <u>stay</u> out <u>here</u>, why don't--
KELLY: I've come, I'm here, I'm staying. Unless there are ticks.
KELLY: Oh my God.
JACK: What?
KELLY: If this is who I <u>think</u> it is. It <u>is</u>.
JACK: Who?
KELLY: Hector Cyr. He's a rich kook mythology professor. He's done some work with our museum. He also treks the world to swim with crocodiles.
KEOUGH: With what?
KELLY: Crocodiles. He's an expert on them. And if he's <u>here</u>... then he must think that's what's in this lake.
JACK: In Maine?
KELLY: There <u>have</u> been Northern sightings. But not <u>this</u> North.
