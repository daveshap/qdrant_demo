CHARLIE: Oscar, what's the matter?
OSCAR: I was the first one to see it. I was coming down the stairs, and there was the watchman lying dead at my feet.
CHARLIE: No kidding?
OSCAR: No kidding. When I saw it, you could'a knocked me over with a pin.
CHARLIE: Where's Matt?
OSCAR: Matt?
CHARLIE: Yeah. He'll have a tough time thinking up a wise-crack for this one . . .
OSCAR: The detectives got Matt up there in Sampson's office.
CHARLIE: He has?
OSCAR: Yeah.
