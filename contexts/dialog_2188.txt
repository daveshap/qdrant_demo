DOUG: And the students?
PAVEL: I have the Director's word, there will be no action against them. You may go once we have the disks.
DOUG: How do I know this isn't a trap?
PAVEL: You have the letter and my word, if you wish you may wait upstairs....Now, where are the disks?
DOUG: I'll need to make a phone call.
PAVEL: You may use my office.
PAVEL: Would you like your things now?
DOUG: Yeah!
PAVEL: Release Mr Greenwell's possessions.
