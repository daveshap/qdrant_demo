control brightness on the second monitor I use HP ProBook 440 with a second monitor [HP Z24i]Currently I can control only the brightness of the laptop monitor with 'Brightness Controller'. I tried f.lux and DisplayCAL. The first doesn't work, the second one has many options and looks extremely complicated. I am novice user in Ubuntu and I would like to have any simple (GUI) solution to make the second screen at least not so bright.best Alex
