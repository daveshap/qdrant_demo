I’m not feeling so good
My girlfriend of nearly a year broke up with me a week before Christmas and I haven’t been taking it well I’ve fell into a bad place and I’m really scared I can’t get out of the house I can’t eat I can’t sleep it’s horrible. I also have a very large history or depression anxiety suicide and anorexia. I was also in a mental health hospital of almost a year. And the worst thing is she was my only friend, so now I literally have no one, and I’m really scared of the feeling I am experiencing now because I know from experience what they have led me to do. I just want someone to talk to
