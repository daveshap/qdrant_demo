GF of 7 years (24F) vicariously lives through YouTube couple vlogs
So as mentioned in the title, my girlfriend of 7 years vicariously lives through these YouTube couples she watches daily, for hours. It was never a problem before until she started to juxtapose our relationship to theirs. She compares how I treat her to how the couples treat each other in their vlogs. Whenever we get into arguments, she’ll just walk away and binge watch these couples for hours. I feel like these couples promote a idealized relationship that is seriously impossible to maintain in reality, but my gf tries to hold me to those standards when she herself doesn’t even do it and it honestly feels like it’s killing our relationship. I haven’t talked to her about because all she does is tell me how bad I treat I her. Man I’m really trying to make this work but it makes me feel incompetent as fuck. I feel like I’m just not good enough for what she expects anymore.
