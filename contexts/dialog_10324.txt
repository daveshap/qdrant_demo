DRIVER: Under the Manhattan Bridge.
NICKY: That's where I peed.
MICHAEL: Who is it?
NICKY: I'm at the door.
MICHAEL: Go way. I'll call a cop.
NICKY: Pop, will you let me in?
MICHAEL: Where the hell are you?
NICKY: Right here. At the door.
MICHAEL: What do you want?
NICKY: It's me. Nicky.
MICHAEL: Nicky comes on Sunday's.
NICKY: Where are your glasses? Go get them.
MICHAEL: If it's you, what are you doing here?
NICKY: I'm on my way to get a haircut.
MICHAEL: Where does Nicky get his hair cut?
NICKY: Across Ninth Avenue. Dodgie's. Where you've been getting your hair cut for fifty years. Where Uncle Billy and Uncle Marty got their hair cut. Where Jim Rorty shot a man for cheating at poker.
MICHAEL: It was rummy, not poker. But I'll take a chance and let you in.
NICKY: It's a constant shock to me, how small this place is. How did we do it? Five people in these little rooms.
MICHAEL: Get yourself something to eat.
NICKY: We must have been heroic.
MICHAEL: Five's not so many. There were families with seven kids. A grandmother. A dimwit uncle.
NICKY: Lillian says it once a week. `Why doesn't he come live with us?'
MICHAEL: You know the answer to that.
NICKY: I do know the answer to that. Why don't we watch the ball game later? We'll go to Mannion's.
MICHAEL: They're only gonna lose.
NICKY: Of course they're gonna lose. We'll watch them lose. What good is heartbreak if we don't experience it firsthand?
MICHAEL: The Red Sox are your problem. I never understood about you and the Red Sox. Everybody rooted for the Yankees.
NICKY: Remember 1949? Last two games of the season. Against the Yankees. The Sox lost on Saturday. Then they lost on Sunday. First I cried for twenty-four hours. Then I had fist- fights the rest of the week.
MICHAEL: It's one thing for kids. You get older, you Nhave other things.
NICKY: It's all connected, Pop. It's one life. Baseball is memory. How do fathers and sons show their love? They go to a ball game together. Thirty-five years later, they sit in the kitchen and remember.
MICHAEL: But the son is suppose to stop crying.
NICKY: I could have grown up happy. A Yankee fan. A divorce lawyer.
NICKY: You'll need these. Tonight. For the play.
MICHAEL: Don't make me sit through one of your plays.
NICKY: Hey, Pop. I know you don't like the commotion of opening night. But I especially want you to see this play. It's new territory for me. And for you too. I have to know what you think.
MICHAEL: Since when did that matter?
NICKY: Let's not start that again.
MICHAEL: My back is killing me.
NICKY: Where's your elastic brace?
MICHAEL: I can't find it.
NICKY: You're suppose to wear it when your back gives you trouble.
MICHAEL: I lost it. I lose everything.
NICKY: I'll go get you another one. You have to wear it.
