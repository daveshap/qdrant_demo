Apply for programs, even if you're unqualified.
As an underclassman, I got rejected from most of the stuff I applied to, but the important part is I wrote a lot of essays. My writing got better. 

When junior year came around and I applied to stuff, I sounded more natural. And the junior year scholarships asked for **a lot** of essays, giving me more practice.

I figured out how to write about myself, what my voice sounds like, and what stories I wanted to tell. I've been cruising through supplemental essays for colleges. It's going even faster because I've recycled a lot of my old essays that worked. At this rate, I'll be done with my applications before school starts in the fall. 

TL;DR: Any opportunity to write essays and get feedback is a good opportunity. You'll be more prepared for college applications.

Edit: PM me if you want to know the scholarships or programs.
