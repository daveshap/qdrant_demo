Money can’t buy happiness but it sure as hell can buy freedom from financially-induced sadness.
Car and laptop repair estimates are about to break my bank account and I’m laying awake unable to sleep because I can’t believe the bad luck I just had. 

At this point I don’t even want happiness, if I have money I don’t care how bland my life is as long as I never feel this stressful or anxious again.

Edit: Thanks for the inbox messages dudes and dudettes of Reddit. This site truly is a wonderful
place. I was just a little spooked when I posted this because it was just terrifying that the two of them happened around the same time. That being said I asked for an advance on my paycheck so I’ll make it through this month. I also found some great
local repair places that are willing to let me pay in increments. I’m very grateful to my irl support network as well. Thanks ya’ll, ya boi will survive.
