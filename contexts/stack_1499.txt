noobie question on 3 phase i am renovating a house and the electrician has installed all new wiring ,circuit switches, outlets etc...  so now the electric company has asked if i want 1 or 3 phase.  I told them 3 phase and already paid for that but now i am worried that the wiring already done might be incompatible with 3 phase.  excuse my ignorance but i never could really understand how electricity works.my old system was on a 5 amp meter and it was a given that i would change the meter to 15 amps--so the new wiring is up to spec--   can someone guide me a little on this.  by the way this is in northern thailand
