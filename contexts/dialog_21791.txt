JAKE: I'm sorry. I had to work late last night. Slept at the club.
VICKIE: I'm leaving you Jake.
JAKE: Sure, what else is new?
VICKIE: No. This time it's true. I didn't bother to tell you until I had everything worked out.
JAKE: Open the door, Vickie.
VICKIE: No. I won't talk to you where you can use your hands on me.
JAKE: Aw, c'mon. Don't say that.
VICKIE: I got a lawyer, Jake. We're getting a divorce. I'm getting custody of the kids.
JAKE: Aw, c'mon, Vick --
VICKIE: I'm sick of it. I can't watch you this way. You're too drunk all the time. There's too many girls. I can't... I don't wanna talk about it. I made up my mind.
