Does anybody else feel like everybody hates them all the time?
For example, I went to a little get together with some strangers with my friend tonight. Right as I was leaving, I felt like everybody was staring at me and waiting for me to leave so they could talk shit about how annoying and unbearable I was. Maybe I’m right, maybe I’m wrong. But I notice myself doing this thing a lot where I just assume that I annoy everyone and I’m better off just being quiet so nobody has to put up with me. Anybody else feel similar?
