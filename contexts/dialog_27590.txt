LEO: Peter, their hands are tied. You see that, don't you?
PETE: I... I don't believe this.
LEO: Are you saying it's a mistake, that you didn't go to any meetings? They say you did.
PETE: Who the hell is this they?""
LEO: Congress, the FBI, Red Channels, it don't matter who the hell they" is. "They" know who "they" are
PETE: No. Yeah... I... I don't know. Maybe I did. Leo, this was before Pearl Harbor. I was in college. It was a bunch of kids, and I was just one of 'em. I didn't believe in what they were saying. Hell, I didn't even know what they were saying!
LEO: So, you're saying that it's true. You went to a meeting of a known communist organization.
PETE: Leo, I was trying to impress a skirt. You know me, I'm non- political. Republican, Democrat, Communist, there's not a dime's worth of difference between 'em anyway.
LEO: You should watch what you say.
PETE: I don't know who fingered me, but I'm not a communist!
LEO: Kid, that cuts no ice with them.
PETE: What? That I'm accused of being a communist when I don't happen to be one?
LEO: They know you were at that meeting, Peter. They've been told, and they know.
PETE: Leo, you're my agent. Tell them" to take a flyin' piss. I didn't do anything wrong. I fought in the war
LEO: Fought? Come on, Pete, you ran the PX at Fort Dix.
PETE: I was decorated.
LEO: I know. A Purple Heart.
PETE: Exactly.
LEO: You broke your arm. You were coming out of a bar. You were drunk.
PETE: At least I was on our side! Look, they want me to testify? I'll testify. I'll tell 'em anything they want to hear! Jesus, Leo, this is my career!
LEO: You can't testify.
PETE: Why not?
