I failed my driver's test for the third time at 20 years old. My god I'm pathetic.
The first time it all went well but then he had me park next to the kerb and back up, and I drove over the kerb.
The second time, I'd only had three hours sleep because I just wasn't tired the night before, so I made mistake after mistake.
The third time, I automatically failed right away because of nerves. I didn't register that the examiner told me to turn right away, and I jerked into the turning lane and almost hit another car.

Yes I know I failed for a reason, but MY GOD, I'm almost 21 years old. And it's going to be a whole four months before I can try again. I'm so tired of being immobilised by my own incompetence that I can't seem to get out of.
