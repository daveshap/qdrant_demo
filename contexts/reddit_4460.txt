I've been a shut in for 10 years
I had no friends in the last 10 years. Iron rust in disuse and so my social skills. I lost my ability to interact and now is very awkward person. I started working out last few years and have made significant progress, physically, tho it didn't boost  my confidence like what google says. I'm drowning in negativity and negative people, how am i going to comeback in the society. I'm 23 years old and i don't have a job, Anybody could you please tell me what to do.

Thanks. God bless
