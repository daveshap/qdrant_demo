In the past, the Department of Justice held the position that Trump's tweets constitute [official statements from the office of the President.](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/nov/14/doj-donald-trump-tweets-are-official-statements-of/)

> “The Court has asked, broadly, about the official status of the President’s tweets … asking the parties to ‘provide insight on … the President’s tweets and what they are, how official they are, are they statements of the White House and the President,’ ” Justice Department attorneys wrote Monday citing a Nov. 2 status conference hearing.

> “In answer to the Court’s question, the government is treating the President’s statements to which plaintiffs point — whether by tweet, speech or interview — as official statements of the President of the United States,” the Justice Department responded.

The President's lawyers [clarified Trump's statement](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/01/us/politics/trump-sessions-russia-investigation.html) by saying this tweet is not an instruction, but just an opinion:

> The president’s lawyers, Rudolph W. Giuliani and Jay A. Sekulow, said in a telephone interview that Mr. Trump was not ordering the inquiry closed but simply expressing his opinion.

> “It’s not a call to action,” Mr. Giuliani said, adding that it was a sentiment that Mr. Trump and his lawyers have expressed publicly before.

> Mr. Sekulow said: “He doesn’t feel that he has to intervene in the process, nor is he intervening.”

> His lawyers said the president wanted the legal process to play out. “He’s expressing his opinion, but he’s not talking of his special powers he has” as president, Mr. Giuliani said

Democrats claim this is a clear attempt to obstruct justice.

From Senator [Chuck Schumer:](https://twitter.com/RepAdamSchiff/status/1024654912385425409)

>The President of the United States just called on his Attorney General to put an end to an investigation in which the President, his family and campaign may be implicated.

> This is an attempt to obstruct justice hiding in plain sight. America must never accept it.

And Senator [Patrick Leahy,](https://twitter.com/SenatorLeahy/status/1024661101466845184?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1024661101466845184&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2018%2F08%2F01%2Fus%2Fpolitics%2Ftrump-sessions-russia-investigation.html) who merely implied this was obstruction of justice:

> When I was a prosecutor, obstruction of justice was often hard to prove, requiring difficult-to-obtain evidence that the individual’s actions were truly intended to interfere with an ongoing criminal investigation. Oh how times have changed.
