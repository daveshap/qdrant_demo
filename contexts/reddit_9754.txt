On-Campus Interviews
So I am flying out tomorrow for an on-campus interview. Woo! I'm very excited, but this is only my second time with this style of interview. The last time I interviewed with an institution I learned quite a bit about how to prepare and what to expect during the process, but I'm still quite inexperienced with this process. I feel very confident that I will fit in with staff, but I'd like to know if there is anything that I can do to better prepare myself for this interview.

Also I am planning to wear slacks with a button down and tie, but no blazer. Is this proper attire, or should I plan on wearing the blazer?

Thank you for any tips you can give me!
