LOWELL: Excuse me. Yeah...
WIGAND: They're terrorizing us. Death threats?! To my family? My kids?!
LOWELL'S VOICE: What are you talking about?
WIGAND: Someone put a bullet in my mailbox.
LOWELL: Jeff, call the FBI right away...
WIGAND: They do this with impunity!
LOWELL: Jeff...
WIGAND: They get to go home at night. What does it cost these people to do this to us? Nothing?! My girls are crying, so fuck them! I want to tape! I'm done thinking about it.
LOWELL'S VOICE: I heard you. But I got to arrange a legal defense first. I got to get you to testify in court, get it on public record.
WIGAND: Then hold it off the air until you got that. But I want to go to New York. And I want to go on the record. Right now!
LOWELL: Good. But Jeff...
WIGAND: I'll call them, Lowell.
FBI AGENT #2: Did you handle the round, Mr. Wigand?
WIGAND: Yes, I'm afraid I did.
