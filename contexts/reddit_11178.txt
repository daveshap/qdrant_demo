I don't think I can raise my son
He's 9 months & the love of my life. I'm obsessed with him & him smiling is the best thing I have seen. But right now my father is dying of colon cancer, I live in his house and I don't know if I'll be able to keep it. I also work for his business & I don't know if I'll be able to keep the business going. Then, my son's father is leaving for good in a week which is both good & bad. 

I'm going to be alone. I have no other family who can help, my aunt already said she won't & my grandmother has Parkinsons and lives in another country. My friends all have lives of their own. 

I don't think I can take care of my son. His father has me so full of doubts. All I want to do is die because I'm so afraid of what's going to happen. I don't think I can do this alone. When I got pregnant everything was fine, my father was healthy the company was doing well, the father & I weren't good but we were working on it. I don't know what to do. All I'm doing now is crying because I'm so lost. I don't want to be alone! I don't think I can handle it. I love my father I want him to see his grandson turn 1. But that won't happen. I don't even know if I'll be able to see him turn 2 at this point I feel like such a failure.
