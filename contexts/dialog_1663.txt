SOPHIA: You look so well, Clair. A wraith.
CLAIR: You think so!? I've been working out a lot since the baby. And I've been working. And that takes it's toll, you know.
SOPHIA: I'm glad that's all over for me.
CLAIR: Don't you miss it?
SOPHIA: Never.
CLAIR: Really.
SOPHIA: Not for a second. Cal can have all that.
CLAIR: Really?
SOPHIA: So where is young Jonah?
CLAIR: With a sitter. We have a sensational sitter. Jonah's really comfortable with her. You know, a second mom sort of. Like part of the family. Amazing with kids.
SOPHIA: What is that thing?
CLAIR: So this sitter can always reach me. I'm still not used to leaving him.
SOPHIA: You should have brought him.
CLAIR: Dander. He's allergic. Otis.
SOPHIA: Oh. Do you have any pictures?
CLAIR: Pictures. They're always in my tote. I left my tote in the damn trailer. But! He's Mac all over again. Imagine Mac shrunk to two-and-a-half feet. The fact is they probably didn't even need me for this birth.
SOPHIA: Are you the funniest person I know, or what?
CLAIR: I can't think how you gave it all up, Soph.
