# Anxiety tip #1 -  Stop consuming caffeine

Caffeine increases the level of a neurotransmitter called norepinephrine in your brain. This neurotransmitter triggers your sympathetic nervous system. Stimulating your fight or flight response is the primary process of the sympathetic nervous system. 

Caffeine also makes your body release adrenaline and depletes your body of the ‘anti-stress vitamin’ B1 (thiamine). For anxious people these things add up quickly, making them feel stressed out and on edge. 

Note: The sensitivity to caffeine varies quite a bit between people. But whether you are sensitive to caffeine or not, **caffeine WILL make you feel more anxious**. It’s best to avoid caffeine as much as you can.

# Anxiety tip #2 - Set specific times in your day to be offline

People with anxiety are usually sensitive and easily overstimulated. We might have gotten used to it, but the internet is a pretty hectic place. Your subconsciousness knows that at any time it could see something on the internet that will trigger it. You won't get really deep rest and stress relief if you are always online

**It’s very important that you create time for yourself every day where you KNOW that you won’t be disturbed**. Most people don’t recover well enough from their daily stress. That’s why our stress accumulates and we end up feeling anxious and on edge more than we need too. We can make sure this stops happening by planning time into our day where we’ll be offline. We should put our phone away and go read a book, meditate, or go for a walk everyday.

# Anxiety tip #3 - Train yourself to breathe through your stomach

Scientists have recently discovered that humans have group of brain cells whose only function it is to ‘watch’ our breath. If the breath is slow, deep, and done with our stomach, it signals to the brain that everything is okay. If the breath is fast, shallow, and done with our chest, it signals to the brain that something might be off.

Breathing in your chest is meant for fight or flight situations. It’s original purpose is to get your body and your mind in a state of readiness by pumping a ton of oxygen into them. 

**Breathing through your stomach has been proven to lower stress and anxiety**. And it’s actually not that hard to retrain yourself to breath like this all the time! If you learn to breathe through your stomach, you will be decreasing your anxiety automatically, just by breathing.

# Anxiety tip #4 - Tie up loose ends

You could do this right now, and it would make a world of difference. We can feel very overwhelmed and anxious because we have so many loose ends in our life. We have mail that we haven’t opened yet, we have friends we should call, maybe our room needs a good cleaning, or you haven’t checked your bank statements in 2 months. 

These things are tricky to actually go and do. The longer we procrastinate, the more anxiety we build up around them. But biting the bullet and doing all these things will reduce your anxiety a lot. It might spike your anxiety while you’re doing it. But when it’s done you’ll feel much better and lighter. **The less we have on our mind, the less anxious we’ll feel.**

# Anxiety tip #6 - Be in flow

Athletes call this state ‘being in the zone’, Psychologists refer to it as flow. It’s a state where you forget the time and whatever is going on around you. If you are in flow you are totally absorbed in what you are doing. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, the psychologist who came up with the concept, describes the 8 characteristics of flow as follows:

1. Complete **concentration** on the task
2. **Clarity of goals** and reward in mind and immediate feedback
3. Transformation of **time** (speeding up/slowing down of time)
4. The experience is intrinsically **rewarding**
5. **Effortlessness** and ease
6. There is a balance between **challenge and skills**
7. Actions and awareness are merged, **losing self-conscious rumination**
8. There is a feeling of **control** over the task

Flow makes you temporarily free from your anxiety in a healthy way. It makes you more calm throughout your day and gives you something to look forward too. Find something that puts you in a state of flow and make sure you do it at least once or twice a week. It will make a big difference in in your life satisfaction.
