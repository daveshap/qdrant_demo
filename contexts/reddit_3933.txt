Is it just me or is it harder to date after school ends and you enter the real world as an adult ?
In school I felt like it was easier. You could  run into a girl and get to know her in class, after class,  go to prom, etc. The opportunities were endless.

In the real world you could talk to women at work but it's  more risky and you have a job to do. If you takeaway work your only option is meeting women outside of it. There's  less time, feels like you have to try harder, bars get old, and people are more serious about dating.
