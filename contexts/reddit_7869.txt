F31 application score is in and it wasn’t discussed
I thought everything was perfect and I put in weeks of effort to make the application so strong. But I guess the two reviewers I got didn’t see it that way.

I told my PI, he tells me not to take it too hard, but I just can’t help it. Every older grad student in his lab who applied for this award got it. Why can’t I be as good as them? Why do I have to be the failure?
