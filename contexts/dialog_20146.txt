MCMURPHY: Maybe I'll just use that thick skull of yours as a batterin' ram, Sefelt.
SEFELT: Why, my head would just squash like an eggplant, McMurphy.
MCMURPHY: You think it's funny, huh?
TABER: Yeah, you don't know how to get outta this place!
MCMURPHY: Put your money where your mouth is, Taber.
TABER: Yeah, yeah, you're a fucking phony, McMurphy!
MCMURPHY: You want me to show ya! You want me to show ya how!
TABER: Yeah, yeah, show me. Show me how!
MCMURPHY: All right!
MCMURPHY: With this thing! I'm gonna put this thing right through the window, that's how!
HARDING: You mean you're going to try to pick that thing up and shove it through the window?
MCMURPHY: You're fuckin' A-right, I am!
HARDING: With your own two hands?
MCMURPHY: You heard me the first time!
TABER: I'll bet a buck you don't do it!
MCMURPHY: You're on!
BILLY: M-M-Mack, y-y-y-you c-c-can't l-l lift that thing!
MCMURPHY: Stand aside, son. Any more takers?
SEFELT: I'll bet a dollar.
FREDRICKSON: Me, too...
MCMURPHY: Right!
MARTINI: A nickel.
SCANLON: A dime.
MCMURPHY: Okay. Who else?
HARDING: Twenty-five dollars.
MCMURPHY: Okay, Harding, you're on.
HARDING: Okay, sucker.
MCMURPHY: Yeah... Okay, stand aside, you guys! You're usin' up my oxygen!
HARDING: Giving up?
MCMURPHY: Just warmin' up.
