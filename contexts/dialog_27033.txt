WILSON: This bloke she was bunked up with. This Terry what'sit.
ED: Terry Valentine.
WILSON: Valentine. What's he got to say for himself?
ED: I dunno. What's he gonna say? They had a fight that night, she drove away, she was upset? I don't even know the guy. Don't get me wrong, Jenny and me were friends, but we didn't travel in the same social circles. She had her life, I had mine.
