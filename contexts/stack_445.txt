Ubuntu 14.04 mouse and keyboard focus different windows I'm using Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS and my mouse and keyboard are behaving weird after login today and after opening one window (firefox, nautilus) and then the terminal (terminator). Mouse and keyboard are both focusing different windows and I cannot click another window or the unity logo, just the window the mouse has focus on.Info:It worked seamless for a good month and this behaviour happened just today.Last thing I installed: WineLast settings I changed: Set gedit as default editor with Ubuntu TweakKeyboard: Logitech K270Mouse: Logitech M705Happens with laptop touchpad, too.Happens on Unity and Gnome.Rebooting does not fix this problem.Cannot upgrade Ubuntu because I need to use ROS indigo.I found other threads, where people had focus problems, but it was due to using gamer mice. And as I said, everything worked before.Is there an easy way to fix this behavior? I cannot think of any cause and can barely work on Ubuntu like this.Any help is appreciated.
