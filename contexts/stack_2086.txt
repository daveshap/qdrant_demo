Capitalization and hyphenation of proper name derived from a number sequence I'm writing a sci-fi novel in which humans travel to a nearby star known by the catalog number Gliese 892, where they encounter a sentient species. Listening to numerous videos about such stars, it is clear that each number in the catalog name is pronounced separately (so it is \"Gliese eight nine two,\" not \"Gliese eight hundred ninety-two\").The crew refers to members of this species as Gliese eight-nine-twoians (and jokes about how awkward the name is).Is there a rule or guideline that can be applied to capitalization and hyphenation of this term?<blockquote>  I met my first Gliese Eight Nine Twoian?    I met my first Gliese eight-nine-twoian?    Something else?</blockquote>Or<blockquote>  The Gliese-eight-nine-twoian was nice.    Something else?</blockquote>
