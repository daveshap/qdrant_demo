How has "Muhammad Ali Boxing Reform Act" (2000) affected boxing in the US? What would be the effects of expanding it to cover MMA fighters?
Background:

* The [Ali Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Ali_Boxing_Reform_Act) was enacted in 2000 to address problems in American professional boxing, especially exploitation of athletes and conflicts of interest rampant among promoters. For example, by requiring boxing promotions to disclose financial information, it hoped to stop promotions from downplaying the income generated by fighters--which would in turn lead to fighters receiving a larger cut. It also hoped to make rankings more objective and harder to manipulate.

* Congressman [Markwayne Mullin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markwayne_Mullin) (R-OK) has introduced a related bill, the [Muhammad Ali Expansion Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/44). As the name implies, it would amend the original Ali Act to include mixed martial arts fighters. This is the second time Mullin has introduced the bill.

* While potential expansion has been discussed in MMA circles from time to time ([e.g., here's something from 2016](https://www.mmafighting.com/2016/6/12/11911444/click-debate-whats-all-this-talk-about-the-ali-act-coming-to-mma)), support of the bill by Democratic candidate Andrew Yang ([policy link](https://www.yang2020.com/policies/empowering-mma-fighters/)) has brought greater attention to the issue. (That's how I heard about it; of course, this thread is not about anything else related to Yang.)

* The UFC opposes expanding the Ali Act to include MMA. Of course it's easy to be cynical about this position, but I'd be interested in any good-faith [steelman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man#Steelmanning) arguments here. For example, [here is a video](https://youtu.be/PFgR2gbzgiI) offering some criticisms of the need for the expansion bill. Also, it's worth remembering that the UFC is not the only MMA organization in the US

* As a general observation, professional boxers make much more money than professional MMA fighters. But this is not only due to fairer contract design; it's also because boxing is just a more popular sport, both for audiences (bigger revenue pool) and athletes (bigger talent pool).

* Fun fact: Congressman Mullin has a professional MMA record of 3-0. Bonus fun fact: Congresswoman [Sharice Davids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharice_Davids) (D-KS) is also a former professional MMA fighter. Bonus bonus coincidence: They are both of Native American heritage.
