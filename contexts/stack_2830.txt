Does gravity CAUSE the bending of spacetime, or IS gravity the bending of spacetime? In reading these discussions I often see these two different definitions assumed.  Yet they are very different.  Which is correct:  Does gravity CAUSE the bending of spacetime, or IS gravity the bending of spacetime?  Or do we not know?  Or is it just semantics?Would, in the absence of spacetime, my apple still fall to the earth?
