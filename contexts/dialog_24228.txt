BALTUS: Clergyman Steenwyck is calling a meeting. This time he is determined to have you forced out, or worse.
ICHABOD: How did you hear this?
BALTUS: He came to me. He promised great violence. Said I should cast you out for my own protection. I must speak honestly. There is no reason to think he will not meet with success.
