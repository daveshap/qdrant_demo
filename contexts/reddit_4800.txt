I'm at my end point.
I feel so alone and like no one cares about me, I have no one to turn to for reassurance or comfort in these very difficult times. Other people have friends and family but I have no one. Suicide phone lines don't help me one bit and besides, I've called too much at this point and I consider myself a nuisance to them. I've attempted to make friends but I always ruin it or they're not interested and ghost me, let me tell you, being thosed or ignored is one of the worst feelings when you're lonely and trying to reach out for that human connection. I don't know what's wrong with my generation or society as a whole, it seems empathy has gone out of fashion with my generation or it went extinct.
