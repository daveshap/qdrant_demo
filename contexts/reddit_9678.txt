Discovered my calling and want to become an academic adviser! Can anyone give some advice on how to start?
Hey everyone, if you're reading this, thank you :). It's a bit lengthy, so if you stick to reading this, I appreciate you :)

TL;DR, want to be an adviser, have an opportunity at a for-profit college...

 I'm a senior majoring in History, and working on a Master's degree in International Studies as part of a combined degree program.

**BRIEF BACKGROUND**

I've had a varied work history, from a big red retail store, to working as an intern for a senator, to software QA, to my current position. I was never able to truly find my groove as you can see. I found myself wanting to be part of academia in some capacity, but never quite sure as to what or how.

I currently work at a community college as an IT lab assistant for one of the computer labs on campus, which is essentially a supervisor role for the lab in which I engage student with their inquiries and check operations.

It's a slow job, but I found that the most exciting part of the day is helping students to solve their problems and make life a little easier for them. I've came to the realization that I'd like to be an academic adviser after a lengthy conversation with my own. I've discovered it to be my own little passion.

Part of it stems from my own experiences in school, having grown up in a high-risk school in Chicago. I want people to have the opportunities I almost never had, and the opportunities many cannot be granted. 

**SO, WHAT THEN?**

I can start at Devry University during the summer as a Student Support adviser. While my mind is in it, my heart is not, considering the nature of the school as a for-profit, and the ultimate goal is *not* the student, but rather, the dollar.

I want to find myself working as an adviser in a university or community college and moving upwards to have a positive influence on a school's operations. The more I think about it, the more I want to provide students with an experience that could encourage others to be in my position.

I've considered looking at NACADA and meeting with advisers at the college I work for! Can anyone else give me some advice!
