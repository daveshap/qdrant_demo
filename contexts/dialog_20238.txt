PETER: It was an emergency. I only lied that night because it was the only way I knew to stop her. I knew if I didn't, I'd never see her again.
KATE: Good strategy.
PETER: Do you know I wasn't even supposed to be in Rome? My boss was supposed to come to this conference, and at the last minute he got the measles. The measles. Who gets the measles at forty-three? So they sent me. And I wasn't supposed to be in that piazza that night either. I'd gone to the movies, only it was sold out. So I was wandering around. Just wandering... When I got hit in the head with this shoe.
PETER: And then I saw her. And all I know is, when I looked in her eyes I saw something... light. And life and passion and yearning. And something else I can't even put my finger on, something I'd never seen before--
KATE: Mania.
PETER: Whatever. And I thought, please God, give me a sign, give me some way to keep this woman from getting into that taxi and disappearing from my life forever. And He did. She told me the name. Granted, it wasn't my name, but it was a start.
PETER: And if that's not destiny, I don't know what is.
KATE: That's really romantic.
