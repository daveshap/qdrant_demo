MILES: I'd like to offer my congratulations. That was a beautiful gesture of Howard's.
MARYLIN: Howard is a beautiful person.
MILES: Yes. He's a diamond in the rough. And I have a feeling that someday soon you'll be taking that diamond and leaving the rough.
MARYLIN: Miles. Miles. Miles.
MILES: I am thrilled for you, but tell me this... How'd you get Howard to do it? I've addressed enough juries to appreciate the power of suggestion, but it seemed like he thought it was his own idea.
MARYLIN: It was his idea. It was a gesture of love and trust. Be happy for me, Miles.
MILES: Well, when this goes south -- promise you'll have dinner with me?
MARYLIN: Have you tried the duck?
MILES: I figure a couple of months. That's how long it should take for the ink on the settlement to dry.
MARYLIN: It has bones. Be sure to swallow one.
MILES: Although knowing you as I do -- there will be no settlement. This time it will be complete and total annihilation.
