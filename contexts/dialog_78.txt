PATRICK: My grandmother's .
KAT: What?
PATRICK: That's where I was last year. She'd never lived alone -- my grandfather died -- I stayed with her. I wasn't in jail, I don't know Marilyn Manson, and I've never slept with a Spice Girl. I spent a year sitting next to my grandma on the couch watching Wheel of Fortune. End of story.
KAT: That ' s completely adorable!
PATRICK: It gets worse -- you still have your freshman yearbook?
