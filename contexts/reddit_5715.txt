What steps should one take after being let go from their job?
My apologies if this is not the appropriate sub-reddit.  

I suspect in the following week or weeks I will be let go from my current position.  My general plan, in no particular order is to:

1. begin searching and applying for new jobs \[friends have already reviewed the resume\]
2. pick up a part time job that can provide some income \[such as driving for Uber\]
3. look at whether or not I may qualify for unemployment \[I suspect I will not\]
4. engage the local community and volunteer/get involved/network more

Is there anything else I should be considering?
