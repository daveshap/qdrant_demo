LIEUTENANT: The Professor's secretary says she found you in Barnhardt's room, making marks on his blackboard.
KLAATU: I was only trying to be helpful. He was having difficulty with a problem.
LIEUTENANT: Oh, I see. He was having trouble and you were helping him out.
KLAATU: That's right.
LIEUTENANT: I suppose you know that Barnhardt does a lot of secret work for the Army.
KLAATU: In this case the secret wouldn't be worth much. He doesn't know the answer himself.
LIEUTENANT: But I suppose you know the answer.
KLAATU: It's really quite simple... The three- body problem, you know.
LIEUTENANT: Your name's Carpenter -- that right? Any identification, Mr. Carpenter? Driver's license -- social security number?
KLAATU: No -- I'm afraid not.
LIEUTENANT: Well, how do I know who you are?
KLAATU: You don't.
