A poverty finance tip that doesn't even require financial literacy: I haven't paid for clothes in two years.
I'll admit, this on won't work for everyone. But it will work for *most people*.

Step one: take a deep breath, remember that your value comes from who you are not what you own, and remember that people *like* helping other people. 

Step two: message all of your family and friends, and mention that you would like to offer them a trade: "Money has been tight recently, I'll take all your clothes to the donation center for you, if you don't mind me looking through them first."

If your family, friends, and coworkers are anything like mine you'll have quite a few people who buy too many clothes and know they buy too many. These people will watch daytime tv telling them how to clean, gather a bunch of their unwanted items in bags, and then never actually go donate them!

Hell, it's such a common occurrence that even John Mulaney did a bit about it.

Don't think you have to be *exactly* the same size either. You'd be surprised how many "oversized" sweaters and "fat pants" people will have lying around that they haven't worn in years. And if you're a bit handy, even complete misses can be cut up and made into patches, washrags, or stuffing.

The final part of this tip is the most important, remember: people like helping, and they *love* hearing that they successfully helped.

No matter how many clothes you ended up keeping/getting rid of, send or say a genuine thank you to the person a week or two after.

Mention it was a big help, and how it positively impacted you (reduced stress, helped save for bills that month, got cat's surgery with extra money, etc.) If they're anything like the people I know, they'll be thrilled and offer to do it again sometime.

And that's how I haven't needed to buy clothes in years.
