Ubuntu 18.04 Desktop - Live USB doesn't boot and shows pixel test on screen I've downloaded/tested the USB live version of Ubuntu 18 on my Desktop and decided to try and install it on my laptop. The laptop is a bit older, runs a 64bit CPU (Intel Q9000).When I try to boot to the USB drive, I see first the regular boot screen (keyboard + circle on bottom), followed by a command line blinking. Then, the screen goes into a pixel test mode, showing all RGB + grayscale test patterns and I hear a drum sound once.When I try F4 to enter the debug mode, the same issue happens after selecting install.Any advice?
