Some my anxiety can get so bad that it makes me have to suddenly poop and makes me nauseous.
I have been working on my anxiety but sometimes when I have a really bad moment I have to suddenly poop and as I’m pooping I’m also nauseous so I have to throw up. And well it’s a mess. 

I’m not sure what to do when this happens, I just end up purging everything in my body and it’s so awful. It doesn’t happen very often but when it does wow it’s terrible.

Does this happen to anyone else? What do you do?
 
Why does this happen?
