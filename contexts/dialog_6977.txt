JENNIFER: No he didn't. Come on, I don't want to be alone with those two. All they talk about is basketball and it bores the hell out of me.
FRIDA: Okay. I guess so.
JENNIFER: Great. George is meeting Carlton first for drinks. We can meet and go together. It'll be a blast.
JENNIFER: Come on, I've been working with Frida. Carlton won't even recognize her now. She's really coming out of her shell.
GEORGE: She's just so... pathetic.
JENNIFER: She's just insecure. Once you get to know her she's fabulous.
GEORGE: She'll talk about PMS and stare at her salad.
FRIDA: I started out on that eye-of-newt diet the doctor gave me and wound up in the tub covered in chocolate.
JENNIFER: Well whatever it was, seems to have worked cause you look great.
FRIDA: You're just saying that.
