If I don't need a relationship to be happy, why does being single hurt so much?
Every time I think about being single and my frustrations with dating my mind crosses the advice that everyone gives, talking about how I should be happy with myself first and that I shouldn't be looking for a relationship for the sake of having one.

But there's this constant sensation of emptiness and sadness every time these thoughts come up and I just wish I still had someone to call a partner and I constantly wonder if I'm in the wrong or if I truly need some form of companionship. It feels like these two narratives in my head are constantly fighting and it leaves me feeling drained and incredibly depressed.
