CLAIRE: What's happening to me?
DR. DRAYTON: Well, that's what we're here for.
DR. DRAYTON: Whether you imagined it or not, you actually saw and heard things that frightened you...that gave you reason for concern.
CLAIRE: Yes, but...
DR. DRAYTON: Your friend saw them.
CLAIRE: Isn't there something called group hysteria?
DR. DRAYTON: You think you influenced her?
CLAIRE: Maybe. I don't know. I just know that when all this was happening, I felt, some part of me felt...alive. Like somebody needed me. And the more I reached out to, it, the fuller it became.
DR. DRAYTON: You're saying you willed these events to happen?
CLAIRE: I don't know, I'm very confused right now.
