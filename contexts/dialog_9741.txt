DRIVER: Haven't you got a jacket or anything with you?
BOBBY: No, I don't, I uh... it got burned up. Everything in the car got the shit burned out of it. All I got left is what I have on...
DRIVER: I've got an extra jacket behind the seat, if you want to put it on.
BOBBY: No, it's okay.
DRIVER: Suit yourself. But I'll tell you, where we're headed is gonna get colder'n hell.
BOBBY: It's all right. I'm fine.
