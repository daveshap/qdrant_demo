If anxiety is keeping you awake right now...
That's fine.

I know you'd rather be asleep. I would too. But we'll get there eventually.

Try not to feel bad if you have something to do tomorrow and you're worried you'll be tired while you do it. 

That happens to everyone.

If the idea of not sleeping right now really stresses you out, get up and do something low impact but productive. 

Update your calendar for the week. Start watching that netflix show you keep meaning to check out. Maybe wash those few dishes that you didn't get to before bed. Sort laundry (this is my favourite, because I hate doing it and often put it off, AND it's quiet.) 

Or pop onto reddit and leave a helpful message for someone.
