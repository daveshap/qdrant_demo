Can I be fired for my super gay Youtube channel?
I just accepted my first job offer, and it's an entry level social media gig at a big company. I have a Youtube channel that I have never mentioned during interviews, and I use a pseudonym (same first name, different last name) on the channel. I've never mentioned it because I talk about things that are very personal to me. Most of my videos are about my sexual orientation, and the ups and downs I've had in accepting myself. I don't use profanity during these videos, but sometimes I'm drinking a glass of wine or saying something that someone ultra conservative might not approve of.

I'm worried that if my company ever discovers this channel, they'll fire me or make me delete my channel and stop filming. Or that someone homophobic might watch me and send my videos to my boss to get me fired. I would never mention my company in my videos, and I do not reveal any personal information that could indicate to any of my subscribers of who I am and where I live. Youtube is not only my passion and a great way to get out my thoughts, but it's also my side hustle, and I'm able to make a decent amount of money from it so I really don't want to lose it. But I also don't want to lose my job.
