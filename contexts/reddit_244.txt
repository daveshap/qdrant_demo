I need some advice :(
I’m on mobile so sorry about the format but I’ve been having some friend problems. So this girl and I, let’s call her F, and I were friends a few years ago but she moved away and moved back a year or 2 ago and we’ve been best friends ever since. Butttt just recently she’s been distant and she’s been getting closer with my cousin, which I consider one of my best friends because we’re the same age and have always been close. 

Anyways F has been getting closer to my cousin ever since before winter break. They even went to Mexico to visit some of my and cousins family and didn’t even invite me. They said it was because they were going deeper into Mexico and that required a passport (which I don’t have) and I understood but they didn’t go deeper into Mexico and it’s sus to me y’know. 

Previously, me, F, and my cousin were inseparable as a group but now I feel like they’ve left me out. Plus F has been talking a lot to our whole friend group before she talks to me. Like bro, you said we were best friends and even said that I was your favorite. Like fucking act like it y’know. Anyways I don’t know if it’s just me and they’ve been excluding me a great deal y’know. And I’m a very anxious person so Don’t have many friends and it sucks that one of the people that I considered one of my best best friends would just ditch me like that y’know. I woulf really appreciate it if I could get some advice on what to do/ tell me if I’m tweaking or not :(
