JIMMY THE DEMON: Nothing's getting through that. The fire is solid as a rock.
NICKY: We gotta get this bad boy burning again. Ideas?
DAD: To do that Cassius and Adrian have to come back through the other way.
NICKY: So go get 'em, Dad!
DAD: I'm too weak. The process has already begun.
NICKY: So go get 'em, Jimmy!
JIMMY THE DEMON: I'm just a demon, Nicky. I don't got devil blood in me. I'd last two minutes up there with your brothers.
NICKY: You're not saying it's up to me?
NICKY: I've never been to Earth. I've never even slept over at some other dude's house!
JIMMY THE DEMON: You're the spawn of Satan. You got it in you.
DAD: Nicky, the worst thing that could happen on Earth is you get killed, in which case, boom, you end up back here.
NICKY: Are you telling me I have to go to Earth and kill my brothers?
