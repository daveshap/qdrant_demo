DOMINO: Take us to Vegas. <b> EXT. DESERT ROAD -- DAY </b> The crew rides in the back of the Wanderer's truck toward Vegas. <b> INT. VEGAS SECURITY LOCKDOWN -- NIGHT </b> Domino stares at Taryn as she returns to the table.
TARYN: This is your last chance. Tell us everything you know.
DOMINO: Do you want know the real reason why I became a bounty hunter?
TARYN: No. Please enlighten me.
DOMINO: I became a bounty hunter because of cunts like you. I remember all the cunts in high school who were mean to me. Eventually... they all grew up to be just like you. Angry and bitter because they peaked early... and now they're stuck in some dead end marriage... or worse yet... an unfulfilling job that keeps them from meeting a man.
