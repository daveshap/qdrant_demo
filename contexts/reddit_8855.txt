Does the federal government possess the power to perform a mandatory "buyback" of certain classes of firearms, such as assault weapons?
Yesterday, [Beto O'rourke](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/beto-orourke-gun-control_n_5d556fc8e4b0d8840fef8cea) came out in favor of a government buyback of assault weapons.  Other candidates have expressed similar policy positions as well.

Would such a law/policy be legal?  There are examples from [Australia](https://www.vox.com/2015/8/27/9212725/australia-buyback), and most recently [New Zealand](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/12/new-zealand-gun-buyback-10000-firearms-returned-after-christchurch-attack), carrying out these types of programs, [but in general these countries did not have a constitutional right to bear arms.](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/08/gun-control-why-us-is-different-from-uk-and-australia.html)

In one of the [most recent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_of_Columbia_v._Heller) Supreme Court cases concerning the Second Amendment, the court found that the government did not have the ability to ban weapons that "were in common use" for "lawful purposes".  This finding concerned handguns.  Would this opinion also apply to assault weapons?
