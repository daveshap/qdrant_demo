I want to suggest an additional rule for this sub: No MLM/Pyramid schemes. They're designed to target the type of people that this sub is meant to help.
I had a roommate completely destory his life thanks to one of these scams, so I'm admittedly biased against them. But they don't belong here at all. 

They're designed to target the poor by luring them in with hope, and then just waste so much of what little money they have. 

If someone promotes one of these scams they should, in my opinion, be immediately and permanently banned. 

If you want a specific list I recommend Wikipedia's list: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_multi-level_marketing_companies Although I did notice a few are missing, such as Pink Zebra. 

r/antiMLM is another good resource
