ALLISON: Daddy!
PARRISH: Hi, Allison --
ALLISON: Have you got a minute?
PARRISH: Not much more. Big day in the big city. What's on your mind?
ALLISON: Fireworks. Update -- we're con- structing the number '65' on the barge, archers from the State College at New Paltz will shoot flaming arrows at it, when it catches fire it will give us the effect of a Viking funeral with none of the morbidity... The Hudson River Authority says, for you, they'll make a special dispensation - of course there'll be an overtime bill for the Poughkeepsie Fire Dept...
PARRISH: Allison, I trust you. This is your thing.
ALLISON: But it's your birthday.
SUSAN: Good morning, Dad.
PARRISH: Hi, honey.
ALLISON: I'm Allison, you're 'honey'.
SUSAN: Drew called from the AStar, they're still two minutes away.
PARRISH: Drew's aboard?
SUSAN: He wanted to ride back down with you. Now sit and relax, get some- thing in that flat tummy of yours --
