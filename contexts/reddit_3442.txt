I think it’s such horseshit when people say “be happy you’re single because relationships are hard”.
Yeah no shit relationships are gonna be hard. NOTHING in life that is good is easy to obtain and keep. Might as well say “be happy that you’re unemployed because having a job is hard” or “be happy you’re uneducated because school is hard” or “be happy you have no friends because keeping friendships is hard”

I see candid pics of couples together who are truly happy and I think it’s bullshit that they would think *I* should be happy that I’m single and that them being together is hard. And if they think I would happier as single then they’re hypocrites for being in a relationship themselves.

Edit: wow thanks for the gold! I didn’t expect this post to blow up like this.
