What are the advantages and disadvantages of constitutionalizing the US impeachment trial procedure?
[The vote over not allowing witnesses and new evidence in the impeachment trial has dominated news cycles lately](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/01/31/us/politics/impeachment-vote.html). Are these elements of a trial that are so fundamental to the proceedings, that they should be accepted out of hand? (And/or there are other fundamental elements of a trial that were skipped that should also be deemed necessary?)

Did the framers leave [the process of the impeachment trial](https://constitutionus.com/#a1s2c5) too open-ended when they allowed for the possibility of the president being acquitted without witnesses or evidence? Are there advantages or intention behind the current vagueness of the procedures as outlined in the Constitution?

Should there be an amendment to the constitution that codifies this process and implements more standards, for example [more closely resembling criminal trial procedure](https://uscode.house.gov/browse/prelim@title18/part2/chapter223&edition=prelim)?

What are the potential downsides of this idea? EG: does this give the Chief Justice too much say in what witnesses and evidence gets allowed? Inconsistencies in going by criminal proceedings in a venue where there is no [well-defined criminal code](https://uscode.house.gov/browse/prelim@title18/part1&edition=prelim)? Are there ways to address these downsides or other ways an amendment could be framed? Should increased rigor on the Senate side raise the standards of impeachment on the House side?
