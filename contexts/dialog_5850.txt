GITTES: Walsh here?
SOPHIE: He's in the dark room.
GITTES: Where'd he go yesterday?
WALSH'S VOICE: Three reservoirs. Men's room of a Richfield gas station on Flower, and the Pig 'n Whistle.
GITTES: Jesus Christ, this guy's really got water on the brain.
WALSH'S VOICE: What'd you expect? That's his job.
GITTES: Listen, we can't string this broad out indefinitely we got to come up with something.
WALSH'S VOICE: I think I got something.
GITTES: Oh yeah? You pick up the watch?
WALSH'S VOICE: It's on your desk. Say, you hear the one about the guy who goes to the North Pole with Admiral Byrd looking for penguins?
