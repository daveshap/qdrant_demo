LION: What -- what did you do that for? I didn't bite him.
DOROTHY: No, but you tried to.
DOROTHY: It's bad enough picking on a straw man, but when you go around picking on poor little dogs --
LION: Well, you didn't have to go and hit me, did you? Is my nose bleeding?
DOROTHY: Well, of course not. My goodness, what a fuss you're making. Well, naturally, when you go around picking on things weaker than you are -- Why, you're nothing but a great big coward!
LION: You're right -- I am a coward.
