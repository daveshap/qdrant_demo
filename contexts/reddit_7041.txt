(21F) want to start an apprenticeship as an instrumentation technician. Help.
I live in Alberta. 
I have my H2S, WHIMIS, CSTS 2020, St.Johns ambulance first aid, cpr and aed and life saving society first aid, cpr and aed.
I have applied to every company I could possibly google. I have been re applying every week for 4 weeks. Almost every time with a new ticket. 
I am more than willing to get any other neccessary or helpful tickets. 
This job sounds super cool to me. I've read the job description and it looks awesome. I love learning, tedious jobs, fast paced everything. I've heard they a constantly busy and I love that. Another driving factor is they make a lot of money which I need. 
My only job experience is retail and housekeeping but I cannot work those jobs anymore.

But there is also a negative thing that I dont know if I should bring up. I have fibromyalgia and sciatica. I know being a female getting in the patch is hard but I also have this dumb disability. I can work fine with it though, except in the cold for long periods of time. My leg locks. But if I have to use my cane it only slows how fast I walk. 

Please I really need some help, after 4 years from school in finally found a job I want to be my career.
