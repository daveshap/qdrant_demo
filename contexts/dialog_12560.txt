NEIL: Why can't you just drive me to my old school every morning?
JULIE: Because you'd have to get up at five a.m., would you like that?
NEIL: I could take a cab on the way home.
JULIE: Here, take this out to the table.
NEIL: But there's this <u>psycho</u>. Really. Mom, there's a psycho I have to deal with <u>every day</u>. I don't know why they let a psycho even go to school!
JULIE: How was lunch?
PHIL: Huh?
JULIE: How was your lunch with Charlie?
PHIL: Oh -- great.
JULIE: Well, did he hear anything about your prospects for the new job?
PHIL: <u>No</u>. If I hear anything you'll be the first to know, all right?
