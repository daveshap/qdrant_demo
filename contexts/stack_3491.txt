Can opening an email be tracked with a wav file? I work for a large company and they are currently running a phishing training program. I received one of these \"safe\" phishing emails and found something I don't really understand.There are several png files and one wav file that are hidden at the bottom, all of which reference what looks to be a unique web site. I know that loading the png image can be used for tracking but by default (I use Outlook 2016) images are blocked and therefore wouldn't load unless I allowed them.So my question is, can wav files be used for tracking when an email is opened and get around the default picture blocking behaviour?
