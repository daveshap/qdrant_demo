Building circuits with BuildCraft I'm making a large logic circuit with ProjectRed, and there are a lot of parts of the circuit that are repeated in a line, so I'd like to \"copy and paste\" a block several times. To do this, I've built the block I want to copy and I'm using the architect table and builder from BuildCraft. I surround the block I want to copy with land marks, put the architect table next to them, and produce a blueprint. However, when I put the blueprint into a powered Builder, the Builder immediately removes the blueprint from the blueprint slot and puts it in the inventory. Is this an issue with BuildCraft and ProjectRed not working together? If so, is there another way to do this? I'm using the FTB Inventors pack.
