Combing logit and linear regression I am looking for a proper method for my research. I want to analyze left-right political position of a person.My idea is to combine logit regression with a linear regression. Logit will decide on weather a person is on left or right side of the spectrum: it will consist of factors like attitude towards immigrants or toleration towards minorities.The other part will define the extremity of person's views. It would consist of factors like being satisified with current government or other factors that push people towards extreme political views.I am looking for anything that can somehow help me find a proper tool.Thanks!
