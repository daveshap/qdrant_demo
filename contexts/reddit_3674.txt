Im 26, and I feel like I'm running out of time dating wise
 

I've never been in a serious relationship, now I've "talked" to guys on dating apps, but it hasnt gone anywhere because guys have been too forward with me too quickly, or the conversation hasnt gone anywhere. So I've given up on dating apps temporarily, mostly because of that but also because I am moving sometime in the next 6 months, and I dont really want to do long distance for my first relationship. Not to mention, I'm not a huge fan of the people in my area for various reasons. I also dont feel like I'm attractive to men out there, unless it's on dating apps. I moved back home the year after I graduated, and I live with my mom currently working for the family business.

Anyways, I see people my age getting married, or in relationships. and I've wanted to be in one for a while. The majority of my podcast group either are in serious relationships are married. But I know now is not the time for me to consider getting in one, however I also still feel like Im running out of time if that makes sense, especially since I'm closer to 30 and haven't had a successful relationship yet.

Honestly any advice is appreciated, really.
