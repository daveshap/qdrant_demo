What's supposed to happen in the \"Something for the Neighbors\" quest? I had a quest from Liam called \"Something for the Neighbors\" and the only objective was to advance Jaal's Friend or Foe mission. But when I did (by handling things on Eos), Liam's mission went straight into the Completed folder.Did I miss something? Is there a different progression through the game (an earlier set of Jaal's Friend or Foe objectives, maybe?) that produces an actual quest or at least a cutscene out of this, or is this it?
