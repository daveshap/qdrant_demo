Michael that is it's in the will - for centuries. Tradition enjoins, Rowan. of course, future earnings from your practice will not fall into -

RYAN: That's new territory for us...but yes, we can look into that. Explore shelter possibilities, funding bodies. we could -
ROWAN: No tax shelters. No funding. I want to fund the clinic - exclusively. The Diedre Mayfair Research Clinic. I'd like to find an existing building and move in immediately - while we draw up plans for new construction.

ROWAN: I plan on liquidating almost evetything.
