Entry level jobs that teach valuable skills?
I'm 22 and feel like I have no real skills that would help me get a decent job. Right now I'm an Aerospace Warehouse Support. For the most part I answer emails from branches and ship parts out to them or fulfill orders for customers. For example Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and a bunch of other places you've probably never heard of. I get paid $13 an hour (30 hours a week) and a little bonus every month if we meet certain goals. I want to start saving up for a house but I need something that pays more. Which I understand in order to get paid more I need a better job and those require skills.

So my question is what are some jobs a person without lots of experience or degree could get that teach valuable skills that could help me get a better job down the line? Also that pay better. (Excluding anything that has to do with sales, automobiles, and construction) 

As of right now I'm leaning to going to work for FedEx. My GF has a friend who is not the smartest guy, but after working there part-time through college he is now making over $100k a year. My GF's sister's boyfriend has been working there for around a year or so and is making $19 hour which probably isn't much to some people, but that's night and day difference for me.
