CARLOS: I get horny as hell for other women. I mean I fantasize about raping some beautiful woman.
WALTER: You don't have to tell me this.
CARLOS: I'm just talking, man.
WALTER: Carlos, I never raped a woman.
CARLOS: I know. I'm just saying I understand.
CARLOS: It's crazy out there. Young girls wearing mini this and mini that. Sometimes when I walk down the street and pass some sexy looking woman, she makes me feel like I'm bothering her. She stares down like she's afraid to look at me. Why she do that? Why can't she look me in the face?
WALTER: Maybe because you're looking her in the face.
