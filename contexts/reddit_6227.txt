What exactly is "business casual"?
Hi folks, 
I've been working at a grocery chain for quite some time and finally received an offer at a veterinary clinic (dream job yay!). Until I've finished my training as a veterinary assistant, they don't want me wearing scrubs. Understandable, given that clients will probably ask me medical questions more frequently should I be wearing them. In the mean time, I was told to wear business casual clothes. 

As someone who comes from a background of wearing jeans and t-shirts to work, I'm not quite sure what this even means. 

I am female if that helps. 

Khakis? Slacks? Button up shirts? 

Thanks!
