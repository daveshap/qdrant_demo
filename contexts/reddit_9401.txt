Predatory loan PAID!
I have just finished paying off an installment loan.  

158$ biweekly is no longer being taken from me. 

I managed to save over 90$ in fees and interest by paying it off early.  

I did this by sending 20-15-30-40$ at a time on top of regular payments. 


I had another one that finished in November.  That one was 181$ biweekly.  



I've left to go. 2600$ at 76$ biweekly.  35% interest rate.   

I'm hoping to have that cleared soon.


Then it's on to the credit card debt. (2500)



There is light at the end of the dark tunnel.   


Feeling much lighter.
