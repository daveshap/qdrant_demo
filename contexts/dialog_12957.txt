DENNIS: If we don't escape, we gotta get the word out about the cash. That's how we'll stay alive.
KEVIN: What are you talking about?
DENNIS: The only way he can keep the cash is if nobody knows about it. He's gotta cap all three of us before they even read our rights. He's probably planning it right now.
KEVIN: That's crazy. He's not going to kill us.
DENNIS: Kevin, you're so fuckin' stupid...
KEVIN: It's over. We have to give up.
DENNIS: Fuck it's over. That money's mine.
KEVIN: That money's fucked up your brain. Talley's going to get tired of waiting for us to give up, and we'll all be fuckin' killed!
DENNIS: Then we might as well die rich.
KEVIN: I'm not going to die for this!
