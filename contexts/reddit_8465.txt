How does a 50-50 tie work in the Virginia House of Delegates?
So last night's elections in Virginia produced a [surprising Democratic wave](https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/republicans-seek-new-path-after-failure-of-gillespies-trumpism-without-trump/2017/11/07/3afb9144-c3e7-11e7-aae0-cb18a8c29c65_story.html?hpid=hp_hp-top-table-high_fallout-1125pm-1%3Ahomepage%2Fstory&utm_term=.b496f767538f) in the Virginia House of Delegates, where [as of this writing,](https://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/virginia-general-elections) at least 14 seats have changed from Republican to Democratic hands.  Currently 5 seats are still being reported as too close to call.  Of those, two Democrats hold a lead and three Republicans hold a lead.

If that shakes out with the current leads holding, and no other seats changing in a recount, that would result in an exact 50-50 tie in the House of Delegates.  (There are 100 seats)

Since the body has an even number of members, are there any tiebreaker mechanisms?  It seems like the vote on the speakership will be important, and under the [current House of Delegates rules](https://publications.virginiageneralassembly.gov/download_publication/87) I can't seem to find any indication of how it would be handled when there's an exact tie.
