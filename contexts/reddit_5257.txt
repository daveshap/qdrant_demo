(Probably) Fired for Lateness
Title. I’m a college senior studying Education, and next year I do my student teaching and will start applying for jobs. At the job I’m currently at, I work as a support staff for people with disabilities. 

I’ve been showing up late by about 5-10 minutes, and was told that on Monday I’ll be getting called into the manager’s office. This is the third job I’ve ever had, I’ve never been fired from my other two jobs: Cashier at Safeway (left after 1.5 years because of management) and Cashier at Winco (left after 1 year for better pay at current job). I’ve been at this job since September 2018 and was intending to stay until June 2021 when I’m done with student teaching. 

So how is me (potentially) getting fired going to impact me? I know I need to fix my absenteeism issues, I just don’t want this to follow me for the rest of my life. And I can’t just leave the job off my resume since I’ve been here for so long.
