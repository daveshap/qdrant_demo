VIRGINIA: We didn't tell her anything yet. We thought that we'd leave it to you. We thought you'd put it like how you were lonely, and why don't she come to live with you. Because that way it looks like she's doing you a favor, insteada we're throwing her out, and it won't be so cruel on her. Do you want Tommy and me to stay here with you?
MRS. PILLETTI: I think it be a better idea if you and Thomas go out, because otherwise she's gonna start a fight with you, and everybody's gonna be yelling.
THOMAS: Hello, Aunt Theresa.
MRS. PILLETTI: Hello, Thomas.
THOMAS: I just this minute got the baby to sleep.
THOMAS: Aunt Theresa, we figure the best way to ask her is you say that you're very lonely, see? And wouldn't she come and keep you company, because that way, you see...
MRS. PILLETTI: Don't worry. I'm gonna take care-a the whole thing.
