Should I take a break after graduating with my B.S. and how should I optimize my break time if I do?
Please be patient if I sound ignorant, I’m the first of my intermediate family (including aunts and cousins, and great aunts etc...) to even make it to college, with some of them not even graduating high school. So I’m a little foggy on this situation. 

So here’s my story - I’m a commuting student that will be going into my senior year next year. And to put it bluntly I don’t think I’m financially ready to pack up and go to grad school, assuming I’ll even get in. 

I’m taking a hit with a 2.9-3.0 GPA after a freshman year that was basically worth nothing after transferring and a personal disaster my sophomore year after I transferred, although my  junior year alone is a 3.5. Since I commute and work so much I have trouble finding comfy internships and experience, which is important in my field (animal science). 

I currently work at a job related to my major, and I have experience at shelters, vet clinics, campgrounds (teaching children about animals) , and I’ve completed 2 independent studies last year and have one lined up this upcoming year, all related to animals. Although I feel like this isn’t enough. 

I want to get into an M.S. program for my major but, as mentioned above, I don’t feel anywhere ready. I can’t even afford the GRE right now, no kidding. 

I was wondering if it would be wise for me financially and academically to take a break. I want time to get more experience and credentials, take my GRE, and even visit my desired schools (which costs a TON of money). 

Would a break year hurt my chances of getting in? Should I go back and fix some classes or gain more experience? 

Any and all insight is appreciated.
