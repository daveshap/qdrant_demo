Are there any political systems where elected officials are legally accountable for their campaign promises?
I'm asking about modern examples.

Historically this has been the case in the Republic of Poland-Lithuania, where the newly elected king had to sign two agreements, [Pacta conventa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacta_conventa) and the [Henrician Articles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrician_Articles), the first one drawn by the parliament and the candidates. Breaking those agreements legally allowed the nobility to rise up against the king in a military way.
