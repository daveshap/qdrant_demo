RIPLEY: Marge? Where are you going?
MARGE: I was looking for a needle and thread. I wasn't snooping. I was looking for a needle and thread to mend my bra.
RIPLEY: The scent you're wearing. I bought it for you, not Dickie. The thing about Dickie. So many things. The day he was late back from Rome -- I tried to tell you this -- he was with another girl. I'm not talking about Meredith, another girl we met in a bar. He couldn't be faithful for five minutes. So when he makes a promise it doesn't mean what it means when you make a promise. Or I do. He has so many realities, Dickie, and he believes them all. He lies. He lies, that's his... half the time he doesn't even realize.
RIPLEY: Today, for the first time, I've even wondered whether he might have killed Freddie. He would get so crazy if anybody contradicted him -- well, you know that. Marge. I loved you -- you might as well know -- I loved you, and because he knew I loved you, he let you think I loved him. Didn't you see, couldn't you see? I don't know, maybe it's grotesque to say this now, so just write it on a piece of paper or something, and keep it in your purse for a rainy day. Tom loves me.
MARGE: Why do you have Dickie's rings?
RIPLEY: I told you. He gave them to me.
MARGE: Why? When?
RIPLEY: I feel as if you haven't heard anything I've been saying to you.
MARGE: I don't believe you.
RIPLEY: It's all true.
MARGE: I don't believe a single word you've said.
