MOZART: Nine performances! Nine! That's all it's had - and withdrawn.
SALIERI: I know; it's outrageous. Still, if the public doesn't like one's work one has to accept the fact gracefully.
MOZART: But what is it they don't like?
SALIERI: Well, I can speak for the Emperor. You made too many demands on the royal ear. The poor man can't concentrate for more than an hour and you gave him four.
MOZART: What did you think of it yourself? Did you like it at all?
SALIERI: I think it's marvelous. Truly.
MOZART: It's the best opera yet written. I know it! Why didn't they come?
SALIERI: I think you overestimate our dear Viennese, my friend. Do you know you didn't even give them a good bang at the end of songs so they knew when to clap?
MOZART: I know, I know. Perhaps you should give me some lessons in that.
SALIERI: I wouldn't presume. All the same, if it wouldn't be imposing, I would like you to see my new piece. It would be a tremendous honour for me.
MOZART: Oh no, the honour would be all mine.
SALIERI: Grazie, mio caro, Wolfgang!
MOZART: Grazie, a lei, Signor Antonio!
