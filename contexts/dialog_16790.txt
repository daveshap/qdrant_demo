CHAD: Why don't they have the same last name? They don't have the same last name.
PHIL: I know -- and I can't really explain that, but I have a feeling there's something, some situation between them, like they don't really know each other much or well, something like they don't talk much anymore --
CHAD: Uh-huh.
PHIL: Does this sound weird?
CHAD: Well I'm not sure why you're calling me.
PHIL: There's no number for Frank in any of Earl's stuff and he's pretty out of it -- I mean, like I said, he's dying, y'know. Dying of Cancer.
CHAD: What kind of Cancer?
PHIL: Brain and Lung.
CHAD: My mother had breast cancer.
PHIL: It's rough. I'm sorry, did she make it?
CHAD: Oh, she's fine.
PHIL: Oh that's good.
CHAD: It was scary though.
PHIL: It's a helluva disease.
CHAD: Sure is. So why call me?
