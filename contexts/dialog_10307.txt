NICKY: I never see you anymore. Where are you all day?
LAUREL: I go to college. I thought you knew.
NICKY: Do you want to get some coffee?
LAUREL: I don't drink coffee, Daddy. And this is not what we should be talking about.
NICKY: What do you want to talk about? I'll talk about anything. What's this?
LAUREL: I'm seeing your play tonight, remember?
NICKY: Why do you need a radio?
LAUREL: So at the intermission I can listen to the ball game. Do you know that mother is seeing a prominent divorce lawyer?
NICKY: That's completely crazy.
LAUREL: Is it?
NICKY: Don't talk like that. How prominent? What are you implying?
LAUREL: She's doing like those Iranians. `I divorce thee. I divorce thee. I divorce thee'
NICKY: And he hears it the same time I hear it? What happened to family secrets?
