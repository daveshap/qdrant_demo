Does anyone else feel suicidal almost everyday but not act on it ever?
When I say not act on it I mean I've never self harmed, never attempted any kind of suicide or damage. But everyday I wake up feeling like whats the point? The main reason I haven't is fear in case I mess it up and I am in pain or disabled for the rest of my life and the other is letting people down, worried my fiance and Mum would blame themselves.

I highly doubt I would ever do it but this is the worst I have ever felt. I have been fine for a while, got engaged just 2 weeks ago but now I am bad again.

Just looking for people in similar situations to talk to
