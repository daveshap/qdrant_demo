ANYA: It's so beautiful ... and sad.
DMITRI: Sad?
ANYA: Lost. it feels lost. This was hers?
DMITRI: Yeah ... well, yours. You still don't believe that you're the Princess, do you?
ANYA: I know I must have had something to do with the palace - I've had little flashes of things - but being the Princess? It doesn't matter as long as I find my home.
DMITRI: Well, the only thing you've got when you've got a home is a fear of losing it! You're lucky you don't remember the revolution -- I never had much, but what I did have -- I lost.
ANYA: I'm sorry.
DMITRI: Hey! It doesn't matter! You gotta make your own way in the world! Don't be sorry for me! I'm going to get what I want don't you worry!
