Interview question...help with phrasing?
Hey Folks,
I have an interview in a couple of weeks!  Yay!  It's for an Assistant Director of Student Activities at a private college and I am thinking of questions I want to ask.  

I know the college has a lot of diversity, namingly POC.  Awesome!  Loads of experience in working with students in a diverse community!  Yay!  

I know I want to ask a question regarding supporting students who may be having trouble dealing with the aftermath of the Charlottesville demonstrations.  Not only am I genuinely interested in the answer, but I want to demonstrate my focus on the student experience and support.  Iknow I don't necessarily want to inject my own opinions into the question, so I guess I need help with phrasing.  How does this sound:

"How have you noticed students reacting to the violence in Charlottesville, and what supports are in place to help those who may be struggling to cope?"

Or, should I just not touch the subject at all?  


Thanks in advance for your help!  

Warmly,
Leah
