What is the collective name for the power, volume, and/or function buttons on a tablet? I'm trying to be the most inclusive when writing a procedure that involves usage of a tablet computing device. I've read about hardware buttons for Microsoft Tablet PCs. I want to know if there's a more inclusive term for them on devices from other manufacturers, as well.An example sentence would be:<blockquote>  \"Press the device's ____ and verify there is no response.</blockquote>
