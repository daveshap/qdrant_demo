JACK: It's beautiful. Thank you.
MARION: I hope it brings you luck.
JACK: It will.
JACK: That girl, she works at the casino --
MARION: -- I don't care about her. Of course, I was angry. But not with you. The book is yours not mine. I was wrong, what I said about it. I hurt you, didn't I?
JACK: You're entitled to your opinion.
MARION: It's none of my business what you write. And your job, that's none of my business either. I love you. And I've done everything wrong.
JACK: I'll leave the casino soon. I promise.
MARION: You will?
JACK: Within a month. Believe me, I'm going to quit!
