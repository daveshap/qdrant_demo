MARY ROBERT: You have to help me
CHRISTY: Right, sure, but what's the problem? Are they keeping you a prisoner here? Do they drug you? Did Reverend Mother like, kidnap your parents? We can call the Enquirer.
MARY ROBERT: No, you don't understand -- I don't want to get out! I want to get in?
CHRISTY: Excuse me?
MARY ROBERT: Oh. Mary Clarence, I'm so unworthy. I want to take my final vows, I would do it tomorrow, but Reverend Mother won't let me!
CHRISTY: She won't? Why not?
MARY ROBERT: She says I should wait. She says that no one should become a nun as an escape from life. She says that I'm not experienced enough to make the decision yet. In a mature manner.
CHRISTY: She said that? Reverend Mother?
CHRISTY: Well, then there's only one thing to do.
MARY ROBERT: What?
CHRISTY: Reverend Mother says you need experience, right, in life. In order to make a responsible decision. This is going to be very painful for me. You know how much I love this little room. This whole convent. Wait.
