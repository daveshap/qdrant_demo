What do admission deferrals look like to grad programs?
This week I received admission into both the University of Miami (OH) Higher Education and Student Affairs program and University of Maryland's program. I could not be happier/ more excited as the impending meteor of graduation hurtles toward my senior year, but things may get complicated. 

Earlier this year I applied to and progressed to the last round of interviews for being a traveling consultant for my fraternity. The applicants who progressed to this final round with me are all waiting to hear back from the fraternity still. Now after receiving admission to my favorite programs, I am worried that I might be extended a job offer. If I accept the job with my fraternity, I am anxious about what deferring my admission might say to these programs. Any advice if I get the fraternity job? Or, what does an admissions deferral say to you?
