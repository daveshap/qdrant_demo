I bought myself tickets to a concert about two months ago just for myself. I forgot about it until this week, but I’ve been really excited about it! Every single day, I’ve been looking forward to it and not dreading it. I’m not even worried I’m going by myself.
Edit: Friends, I made it! I got dressed up, made it to the venue, and I’m here!
