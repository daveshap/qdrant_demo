ROTHSTEIN: Why didn't you tell me that Maranzano had made you an offer?
LUCIANO: I turned him down flat.
ROTHSTEIN: And if I had known, I would have warned you to expect this. We could have prepared.
LUCIANO: Masseria's been after me too.
ROTHSTEIN: Thank you for keeping me informed.
LUCIANO: We were overdue to get hit.
ROTHSTEIN: You think this is a coincidence? Next week half your customers will be buying their Scotch, our Scotch, from Maranzano. In a month, he'll be in Scotland talking to my distillers, because you can't move product. I'll be out of business, and you'll be working for Maranzano.
LUCIANO: We can operate around these guys.
ROTHSTEIN: Not by scurrying around like a puppies in a roomful of elephants.
LUCIANO: Okay. I'm listening.
ROTHSTEIN: A hundred years ago Austria was run by a prince named Metternich. Austria was weak, and it's neighbors were strong. But they were ruled by passionate men, while Metternich was ruthless and brilliant. If one country got too strong, he rallied an alliance against it. He would lead all of Europe to the brink of war, then bring the enemies together and forge the peace.
