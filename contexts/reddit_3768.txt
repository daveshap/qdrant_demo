Is it normal to feel a bit sad on Valentine's Day?
I used to push my bitterness and sadness away for a long time by acting like tomorrow is just another day. Just another stupid holiday that people go crazy for. But recently I've been accepting my feelings and thankfully let go of my bitterness thanks to the therapy that I've been getting. 

But I do feel sad and lonely though. I walk around and see some people holding hands, kissing, and hugging each other, and it makes me feel isolated. I feel like I'm missing out, and it honestly kind of sucks. 

Is this normal?
