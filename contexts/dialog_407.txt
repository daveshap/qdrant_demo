ALICE: You what?
KRISTEN: When I used to have nightmares. I brought my friends in to help me. Until they all started dying.
RICK: What is it?
KRISTEN: Oh God! He killed them!
NURSE: Feeling better now?
KRISTEN: Yeah. I guess so... What happened?
NURSE: You had a nasty bump.
KRISTEN: I gotta get out of here.
NURSE: You just stay put. You need rest.
KRISTEN: You don't get it, he's after me...
NURSE: Don't worry, honey
