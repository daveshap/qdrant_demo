ATTENTION ALL TEENAGERS: This sub is an early breeding ground for future INCELS and we should work to prevent it.
Greetings,

I've been a pretty long time reader of this sub. I have noticed a lot of posts along the lines of "I just asked my crush out" etc. 

Those posts are totally fine. We all like the comradery and supporting a fellow peer; however, its the comments and some of the other posts that breed this incel culture.

From the front page of this subreddit today:

 [I'm having a date with my crush in about 3 hours](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/amcok2/im_having_a_date_with_my_crush_in_about_3_hours/)

>Jesus lucky bastard

>You lucky shit! 

>Thanks, although I don't think much will change. Rn I'm just lying in bed watching anime like the lazy piece of shit I am.

>Tell us if you bang her

>I've always become friends with my crushes... just friends...

>You lucky piece of shit....

The "lucky" comments seem to insinuate two things. First, that love and happiness is based on luck, and that these commentors are just unlucky and won't even find love. Second, there is a bit of bitterness and disdain toward the "lucky" person. Kind of like saying, "Why this fucker and not me!!!!" Additionally, this thread also had some pretty incel-specific comments (3rd and 6th). Some of the responses to those comments were along the lines of, "oh don't worry it gets better you just need to wait it out". NO! That is the worst thing you can tell someone in that situation! More on that later.

[Anyone else feel heartbroken despite never having had a girlfriend?](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/amdkvp/anyone_else_feel_heartbroken_despite_never_having/) - **200 upvotes**

>At least you got offers

>Yep, except I didn't had any offer...

This post was pretty good overall. A lot of the other comments were supportive.

>I know how fustrating it can be trust me. But you are feeling this way because you're focusing too much on the fact that someone might turn up and then they don't. You shouldn't let wanting a relationship affect how you act or do work, otherwise you'll fall into a depression

We should take the example of this guy above. When you see someone posting stuff like this, work to counteract it. Don't let your friends on this sub fall into this incel-ish mentality. They may not be a full incel yet, but these types of feeling are what create one in the future.

**Those two posts are just examples from today. There are many more out there. PLEASE BOIS, when you see a friend display incel tenancies, try to snap them out of it!**

*If you are an incel or pre-incel reading this post, here are some suggestions to snap out of it:*

- You can't just sit idle and "wait for life to get better"! You have to get out and do something. Make something. BE SOMETHING. Sitting idle and waiting just allows someone to perpetuate their own grievances and get mad at the world that "life is not getting better for me". If you want your life to get better, you have to pull yourself up by your bootsraps and tell yourself "I want to change".

- Work out (strength, cardio, whatever). I can't tell you how amazing you will feel once you begin getting some exercise. It is almost like a drug, it's that good. 

- Bathe. You will feel good once you're clean.

- Talk to people in person. It's not as weird as you think to just randomly just start talking to someone (men or women).

- Stop doing drugs if you do them.

- Cut out the porn. You'll begin to see women as real people instead of sex objects. 

Thanks for reading.

**THE ONE AND ONLY EDIT:**

Quoting one of the replies:

>Why does no one see the point of this post. The point of this post wasn’t to call out kids who are depressed about not being in a relationship. The whole point was to just let people know about how incel behavior, given the right conditions, can manifest itself in teens as they grow older

>If this post prevents one depressed kid from becoming an incel in any way, then it’s done it’s job.

What this person said above is true. I've had numerous people PM me and say how they are going to improve themselves and turn themselves around. WONDERFUL! I'm glad this post accomplished something. A lot of the replies to his thread are completely disgusting. Not to mention the replies that perfectly exhibit the behavior I am trying to point out in this post.

Thanks to those that were able to have a civilized discussion.
