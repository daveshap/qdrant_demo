Screenshot paste only works in some apps, not in Google Chrome I used to love shift+control+command+4 for pasting screen grabs. But now it doesn't work in Chrome.In Stickies and Text Edit it doesn't work and gives the Apple error sound.The pasting Works fine in Discord, Skype and Firefox.I'm using macOS High Sierra 10.13.4, copy paste image doesn't work in Safari either.This is a real productivity killer.
