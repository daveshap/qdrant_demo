Having separated parents for college searching sucks
My parents are separated and i only go on college tours with one of them at a time. The problem is when both of my parents want to go to a specific school. I hate college tours and info sessions but I have to go on some of them twice just for my parents. It’s so goddamn boring. I’m the one applying and I’m not getting any extra information from going to the same info session twice.

Edit: this sounds a lot worse than it is, lol. I’m super grateful that my parents are supportive of my college search. They get along well, but I prefer only going with one at a time on college trips. But anyway, this is the most upvotes I have ever gotten on a post so uhhhh thanks. And glad I was able to inspire some discussions and support in the comments. Love you all.
