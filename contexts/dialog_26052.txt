LENNY: See, it's all about what they see walking in. A dead hooker, handcuffs, penetration... they'll see a trick gone wrong. Random kill. The kind you never solve.
MACE: But that doesn't add, does it.
LENNY: No it doesn't.
MACE: Because Iris knew somebody was after her.
LENNY: She said If they get me". They. Which means the whole sex-killer thing is a cover
MACE: So the guy's not a sicko.
LENNY: If he could do what's on that tape, he's a sicko.
MACE: Okay, so he's a freak who thinks he's sane pretending to be a freak. The point is, he was a hitter. Somebody wanted to shut her up. But why not just put a little lead in her ear?
LENNY: Because it had to look random. Not connected to anything or anyone. But then why give the rape to me?
MACE: That's where it gets a little strange.
LENNY: And what about the guy that was following me?
MACE: Now you're really getting paranoid.
LENNY: The question is not whether I am paranoid, but whether I am paranoid enough. You want to rub my neck?
MACE: Sure.
LENNY: How's Zander?
MACE: OK. He asks about you all the time. It's been weeks since you've seen him.
MACE: I'm sorry about getting on your case earlier. I just see you getting sucked in deeper and deeper, and I -- anyway. I'm sorry.
LENNY: S'okay. I know you still love me.
ZANDER: Where were you Mom? Did you meet a guy?
MACE: Just Lenny.
ZANDER: Right. That explains it.
MACE: Are you going to make me beg?
MACE: What is that?
ZANDER: Cheerios and wieners. I made it myself. It's good.
MACE: Well give me some then... I'm starving.
MAX: Hey, the last day of the world and you spend it in bed.
LENNY: W'sup, Max?
