KAY: Mr. Whale, this is such an honor. You're one of my favorite all-time directors. I can't believe I'm meeting you.
WHALE: No. I expect you can't.
KAY: And this is your house. Wow. The house of Frankenstein. I thought you'd live in a spooky old mansion or villa.
WHALE: One likes to live simply.
KAY: I know. People's movies aren't their lives.
