My father just missed his flight to get to my brothers graduation..
My dad just missed his flight to my brother's graduation..He's in CO and we are in VA and I'm sure it's impossible for him to make it here before tomorrow. I barely get to see him so I'm just kinda sad and frustrated right now. He was supposed to get here today and take us out I even woke up early and got ready and I turns out he may not even get here at all. I'm pretty sure my brother is frustrated at this also..just not sure what to think of this..
