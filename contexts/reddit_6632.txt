I have an interview with a recruiter on Monday whose title is “Diversity Sourcing Specialist”. What does that mean? I’m a white guy why is she tracking me down to get me to apply for this job? Should I even bother because they’re clearly only interested in women and minorities?
Edit; I’m going to take the interview the last question was rhetorical.

Maybe it’s because of my status as a military Veteran? Is that some kind of quota they need to fill? Let’s just cut the BS; when a company is looking for “diversity” they mean they’re looking to hire people who aren’t white males. It’s a large international bank and a high paying job but I don’t want to work for a company that hires/promotes people based on race and gender I want to work for a meritocracy. It just seems strange to me that her title is literally “I specialize in hiring people who aren’t white men”. Obviously, if a company even has such a position they’re obviously looking for a specific race/genders (everything but straight white men).
