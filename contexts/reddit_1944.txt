Farewell for now!
Hey guys, the time has come for me to depart. I’ve enjoyed the last few months contributing to this sub and I may pop by from time to time but a new assignment has come my way that I can’t pass up so I’ll have to put all my attention to ensure its success. Wish me luck!

Word of advice: keep your negativity to yourselves. It disincentivizes people like me from giving a valuable perspective. It’s really not fair to the people that need the help. If you don’t like what someone has to say then downvote and move on with your life. 

For those that do appreciate me, thank you from the bottom of my heart and drop me a pm if you need help and please point people to my old posts for interview related matters in my absence. I’ve gained a lot from so many of you and I hope to remain in touch. If you ever need me please mention my username in a comment because I won’t have the time to browse the sub but I should be able to take direct questions on an ad hoc basis.

edit: wow! I did not anticipate such an amazing response. Thanks so much guys. Keep the PMs and chats coming if you have specific issues. 

I still have a ton of coins so I expect you guys to keep the meme quality rising each week but I will drop in every so often the ones that have passed the IBC test!

Please let me know if any of you get in to your top choices
