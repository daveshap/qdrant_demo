induction motor stability Does the change in slip (s) have any impact on load torque in an induction machine/motor? I know it affects the motoring torque. But do the load torque also get affected by the slightest measures if not more?.Now my question is if the load torque is independent of slip, shouldn't be BC (the graph for load torque) a straight line parallel to y axis rather than increasing slightly as slip tends to 0?
