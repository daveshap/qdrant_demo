An idea if you need but can't afford therapy
If you live near a university, try calling their psychology department and see if they have a doctoral student clinic. A friend told me about one in our town, and it's $5 a session for students, and then sliding scale for everyone else. For their sliding scale it is also $5 per session for anyone who makes under $30k a year. It is students, but it's doctoral students being supervised via recording. There are confidentiality rules they follow, so it's as confidential as seeing an actual therapist. I know this isn't an option for everyone, but I figured it was still worth sharing in case it did end up helping someone out. They don't usually do a lot of advertising because they would get way too many people.
