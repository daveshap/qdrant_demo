Why do I get \"A program tried to load new system extension(s) signed by 'Benjamin Fleischer'\"? When I try to mount a disk using sshfs on my Mac High Sierra v10.13 I get the pop-up message:<blockquote>  System Extension Blocked    A program tried to load new system extension(s) signed by \u201cBenjamin Fleischer\u201d.  If you want to enable these extensions, open Security &amp; Privacy System Preferences.</blockquote>Why do I have to enable an extension? Is this new in High Sierra?
