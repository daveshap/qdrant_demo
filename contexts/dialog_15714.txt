CLARICE: I was your choice, Dr. Lecter. You chose to speak to me. Would you prefer someone else now? Or perhaps you don't think you can help us.
DR. LECTER: That is both impudent and untrue... Tell me, how did you feel when you viewed our Billy's latest effort? Or should I say, his next-to-latest"?"
CLARICE: By the book, he's a sadist.
DR. LECTER: Life's too slippery for books, Clarice. Typhoid and swans came from the same God. Tell me, Miss West Virginia - was she a large girl?
CLARICE: Yes.
DR. LECTER: Big through the hips. Roomy.
CLARICE: They all were.
DR. LECTER: Mmm. And what else...?
CLARICE: She had an insect deliberately inserted in her throat. That hasn't been made public yet. We don't know what is means.
DR. LECTER: Was it a butterfly?
CLARICE: A moth... How did you predict that?
DR. LECTER: I'm waiting for your offer, Clarice. Enchant me.
