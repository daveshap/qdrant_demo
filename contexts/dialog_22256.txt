APOLLO: You best find me another ranked contender an' I mean in a flash, man!
JERGENS: I contacted Ernie Roman's manager, he's fighting in France the same week.
APOLLO: Then gimme Buddy Shaw -- He's ranked fifth.
JERGENS: Shaw's fighting in South America -- Why not postpone the bout until July Fourth?
