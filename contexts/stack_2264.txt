How to duplicate Cracked Red Eye Orbs? Before I dive into my issue, here's a disclaimer:I harshly condone all forms of hacking. I this question is strictly meant to improve my PVP experience and will not affect the combat situation in any way.Well, I do not like to seek refuge in hacking, but it has to be done. I own Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition, and I must say the PVP experience is great (apart from the backstab fishing). The only problem is that I do not have any Cracked Red Eye Orbs, and it's too late for me to join the Darkwraith Covenant (in this playthrough at least; already placed the Lordvessel...). So, you see, I have NO consistent methods of acquiring items that would allow me to invade (I do not intend on using Red Sign Soapstone).I am sure that the duplication of items via Cheat Engine is possible, but I have no idea how to do it. I'd be very thankful if someone would write me a comprehensive yet short tutorial (note that even if I wanted to cheat, a wonderful tool called PVP Watchdog would prevent me from connecting to other players if I had, say 99 Titanite Slabs). My two main questions are:How to duplicate Red Eye Orbs?How to force the game (via Cheat Engine) to make me a Darkwraith +1 AND transmute some item into a Red Eye Orb (which is permanent)?Even better, if anyone knows of a \"legal\" way to get the needed items, let me know (I should mention that I am on NG +4 right now, I've killed all bosses except The Four Kings and Gwyn). Thank you for your answer in advance!
