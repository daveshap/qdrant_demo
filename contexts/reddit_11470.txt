Afraid of Death
I'm a 15 year old atheist. and ever since I was young I always wondered what it's like to die.  Death scares me, When I think of it I always wonder if I will ever see my parents again, or if I can do the things I like again.  I don't like the idea of living forever. I always think that I will be bored and will have nothing to do when I reach a thousand or a million.

What do you think will be the most effective way to overcome my fear of Death?
