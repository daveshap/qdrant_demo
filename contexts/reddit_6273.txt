I sipped once in weed vape pen two days ago and need to conduct a drug test.
Hi all,

&#x200B;

I got an offer from a mortgage company and in order to finish the onboarding process, I need to submit a drug test.

&#x200B;

Here's the thing. I am not a smoker and I do not regularly smoke weed. I just sipped once from my friend's weed vape pen two days ago and I got an offer letter the next day. I am going out of town for the weekend and will be back in town on Monday and will be going to the site to submit the drug test.

&#x200B;

Will I fail the drug test? I was doing some research and it said substance will be in your system for a week (urine). I'm not sure if that applies to the non-smoker.

&#x200B;

Am I worrying too much? I'm a bit concerned since this will be my first drug test.

Edit: this is in California
