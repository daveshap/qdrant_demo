Student Affairs Graduate Assistantships Interview Advice
Greetings!
I have a few interviews for Graduate Assistantships on Thursday and Friday that I am incredibly nervous about. Thankfully, I have a lot of experience in Residence Life over the past three years but I would appreciate any type of interview advice. 
What questions should I expect?
Any advice for things I should talk about during the interviews? What would be the best thing for me to say when they ask if I have any questions for them?
Thank you for your help! Any type of life experience, advice, or pep talk will be greatly appreciated!
