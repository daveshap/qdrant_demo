LONGFELLOW'S VOICE: I don't mind though. I had a lot of fun doing it.
BABE: Would you like to go for a walk?
LONGFELLOW: Yes, if it isn't too late.
BABE: I'll get my hat.
LONGFELLOW: Nice day out - er, nice night - wasn't it? - isn't it?
MABEL: Yes, lovely. We've had a lot of nice weather lately.
LONGFELLOW: It would be a nice night to go for a walk, don't you think?
MABEL: Oh yes, I think it'd be a swell night to go for a walk. A nice long one.
BABE: Ready?
LONGFELLOW: Gosh, she looks better every time I see her.
BABE: Thank you.
LONGFELLOW: Goodnight. Don't worry. I won't keep her out late.
MABEL: Thank you so much. Good night.
FRANK: Ow! My foot's asleep!
BOB: Come on - let's go!
