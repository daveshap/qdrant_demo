macOS High Sierra: Where is the Secure Empty Trash option? There used to be an option to delete files securely in older versions of Mac OS X. However, I am unable to find the same in macOS High Sierra 10.13.5.Is the option removed? If yes, what's the probable reason? As I understand, the command was useful to ensure that data could no longer be recovered from the hard drive.I am using a Late 2013 15\" retina MacBook Pro.
