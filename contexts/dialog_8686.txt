STAN: Hey.
MARY: Do you swear you didn't know?
STAN: I swear.
MARY: And you never even suspected? Never saw us behaving in any unusual way together?
STAN: Once, maybe.
STAN: It was here. At his car. I was coming back from a job and spotted you together. You seemed caught. I waved. You giggled.
MARY: How did I look?
STAN: Happy. Happy with a secret.
MARY: And after that?
STAN: I never saw you together like that again. So I figured I was imagining things.
STAN: I really like you, Mary. You know that.
MARY: Do you remember anything else? What I was wearing? Was I standing close to him? Was I leaning against his car like I owned it? How did he look at me when I giggled? Tell me everything.
STAN: You were in red. That red sweater with the little flowers, I think. You were leaning against his car. He looked a little like a kid. Kind of goofy and wide-eyed. I'd never seen him look like that before. Happy. You looked beautiful. You looked in love.
MARY: Thanks, Stan.
