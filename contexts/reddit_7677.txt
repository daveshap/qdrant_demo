Does having a degree from a respected school matter for academic jobs?
If I get a PhD from a school that’s very well respected (not quite Ivy League but close), will I get better jobs than if I get the same degree from a large state school? I’d like to think departments want good teachers more than fancy degrees, but I know reality might be different. What has been your experience?
