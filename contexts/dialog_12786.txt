HILDY: Let him out of here, Lieutenant.
LIEUTENANT: But, Hildy, I can't. He's accused of stealing a watch. And they found the watch on him.
HILDY: And who accused him? Diamond Louis! One of the worst crooks in town! Why don't you arrest Louis instead of innocent people that he frames?
LIEUTENANT: Now, Hildy --
HILDY: Don't Hildy me! Are you going to let him out?
LIEUTENANT: I can't.
HILDY: All right. You can't. But tomorrow the Post will run the story of that roulette game on 43rd Street that your brother-in-law runs. And we'll print that you get five hundred a month for forgetting about it!
LIEUTENANT: Now, Hildy, don't be hasty! I can't let him out.
HILDY: You can let him out on bail, can't you?
LIEUTENANT: Five hundred dollars.
HILDY: You'll take fifty and like it!
LIEUTENANT: Well, all right. But I'm liable to get into a jam.
