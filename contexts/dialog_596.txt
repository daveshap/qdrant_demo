MARTHA: What happens if the bell rings and you're under there?
AGNES: Oh, it's even more wonderful then.
MARTHA: It's like hiding from my mother when I was a little girl.
AGNES: Where did you go?
MARTHA: Oh, no place as wonderful as this. Agnes... have you ever thought of leaving the convent for something else?
AGNES: No. There is nothing else. Just being here at night helps me sleep.
MARTHA: You have trouble sleeping?
AGNES: I get headaches. Mommy did too... oh, but she wasn't stupid. She knew things that nobody else knew.
MARTHA: What things?
AGNES: She knew what was going to happen to me. That's why she hid me away.
MARTHA: How did she know that?
AGNES: Somebody told her.
MARTHA: Who?
AGNES: I don't know.
MARTHA: Agnes...
AGNES: You'll laugh.
MARTHA: I promise I won't laugh. Who told her?
AGNES: An angel, when she was having one of her headaches.
MARTHA: Did your mother see angels often?
AGNES: No.
MARTHA: Do you?
AGNES: No.
MARTHA: Do you believe she really saw them?
AGNES: No, but I can never tell her that.
MARTHA: Why not? Mmm?
AGNES: She'd get angry.
MARTHA: Agnes, did you love your mother?
AGNES: Yes.
MARTHA: Did you ever want to be a mother yourself?
AGNES: I could never be a mother.
MARTHA: Why not?
AGNES: Well I don't think I'm old enough and besides I don't want to have a baby.
MARTHA: Why not?
AGNES: Because I don't want one.
MARTHA: If you did want one, how'd you go about getting one?
AGNES: From someone who didn't want to have a baby.
MARTHA: Like you?
MARTHA: How would that person get one if they didn't want one?
AGNES: A mistake...
MARTHA: Agnes, how did your mother get you?
AGNES: A mistake... it was a mistake...
MARTHA: Is that what she said?
AGNES: If you're trying to get me to say that she was a bad woman and hated me and didn't want me but that's not true, she was a good woman, a saint...
MARTHA: Agnes, I don't believe you know nothing about sex...
AGNES: I can't help it if I'm stupid.
MARTHA: ... that you don't remember getting pregnant...
AGNES: Not my fault.
MARTHA: ... and that you don't believe you carried a child.
AGNES: I was a mistake.
MARTHA: What the child?
AGNES: Everything... I don't have children.
MARTHA: Agnes...
