does anyone ever feel mediocre ðŸ¥º
Iâ€™m not bashing anyone in particular but itâ€™s mentally draining when I see chance meâ€™s with obviously great candidate. I almost feel like partial joy because I know that person will do amazing but partial sadness because I donâ€™t have the same research opportunities, connections for internships, nor stellar grades. What do yâ€™all think?
