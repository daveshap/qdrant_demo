MALCOLM: Brother Earl.
BROTHER EARL: Malcolm, where are you? We've been calling all over the city.
MALCOLM: I'm gonna try and get some work done tonight.
BROTHER EARL: Let some of us come down there.
MALCOLM: No, that won't be necessary. I'll be all right.
BROTHER EARL: I wish you'd listen to us. What about the meeting tomorrow? We need to frisk people.
MALCOLM: I don't want folks to be searched, it makes people uncomfortable. If I can't be safe among my own kind, where can I be? Allah will protect me.
