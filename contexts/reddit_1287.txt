Is anyone else introverted most of the time, but very extroverted in friend groups or people you're fairly close with?
When I have to be in uncomfortable social interactions (large meetings at work, networking &amp;amp; meeting with possible clients at dinners, etc.) carrying on normal conversation and staying "in the pocket" is extremely draining.

However, in my groups of friends and acquaintances, I'm one of the most talkative, outgoing, and funny people (my opinion) in the group and it makes me feel genuinely happy.

What does this mean? I understand that the whole concept of introvert vs extrovert isn't black and white, but what can I learn from this? 

Edit: thanks for the responses. A lot of people are saying things like "well yeah that just sounds like social anxiety", or "you're more comfortable around your friends so obviously you'll be more yourself" but that's not what I'm getting at. I don't just become a "normal" member of the conversation when I'm comfortable - rather I tend to dominate it. I enjoy it a *lot*. So I'm wondering if the repressing of my own thoughts and words in uncomfortable situations is sort of causing this buildup of social energy which then gets released when I'm comfortable.
