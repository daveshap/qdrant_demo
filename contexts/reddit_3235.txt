Should I give up on finding a job that I enjoy?
20/yo Web Developer here. I worked hard to set myself up for a productive career as a programmer and I'm on a steady path for it â€“ unfortunately, it it makes me miserable.

I've worked jobs that are enjoyable but not fulfilling, my brother is a scientist who would describe what he does as fulfilling but not enjoyable, and I'm currently working a job that is neither but pays well. I'm already feeling like resigning to the "suffer in quiet desperation" life path.

What I want to know is: does anybody here find their job to be both enjoyable and fulfilling? Does anybody feel that their work tangibly affects the world? Am I just part of a spoiled generation, and that's why I think I'm supposed to enjoy my job and make a positive difference in the world?
