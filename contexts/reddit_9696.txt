Student Affairs Spring Graduate programs?!
Hi there!

I'm currently a senior undergraduate student at UT Dallas. I'm graduating in Fall 2013, and looking for a Student Affairs program starting in Spring 2014. I've been going through NASPA's directory desperately searching for programs starting in spring but I've had very little luck thus far. Most programs I've come across start in the fall.

Do any of you know any universities off the top of your head that have programs beginning in the spring? Or any idea what I can do to find out?

So far I've contacted the following for confirmation of spring programs based on what I found or heard about: University of Central Missouri, Shepherd University, Arkansas Tech University, Bowling Green State University, Kent State

Update: I also found Spring programs so far for- University of North Texas, Texas Tech, Loyola University of Chicago, NYU, University of Arkansas, and University of Memphis.
Any help would be greatly appreciated- thank you!
