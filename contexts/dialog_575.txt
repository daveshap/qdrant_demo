JACK: I'm fucking out of here.
WADE: Lawford?
JACK: Out of this fucking job. This job sucks. Working outside in the winter sucks.
JACK: Open the door, will ya?
WADE: Why don't you quit now, you want out so bad?
JACK: Open the door. We're late.
WADE: I mean it -- you got enough money now. Head out for California. Surf's up, Jack, and you're digging wells in the snow.
JACK: What do you mean I got money? I'm as broke as you.
