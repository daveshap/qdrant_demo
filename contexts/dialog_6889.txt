KATHRYN: Well done.
SEBASTIAN: Thank you. Now, where were we?
KATHRYN: To my triumph, of course.
SEBASTIAN: Not my choice of toast, but it's your call. To your triumph over Annette.
KATHRYN: Silly rabbit. My triumph isn't over her. It's over you.
SEBASTIAN: Come again?
KATHRYN: You were very much in love with her and you're still in love with her. But it amused me to make you ashamed of it. You gave up on the first person you ever loved because I called you names. Don't get me wrong, I'm flattered that you chose me over her, but please understand, I never loved you, Sebastian. You're just a toy. A little toy I play with. And now you've completely blown it with her. I think that's the saddest thing I've ever heard. Cheers.
SEBASTIAN: In any event, you still owe me my reward.
KATHRYN: I'm sorry, but unfortunately I don't fuck losers.
