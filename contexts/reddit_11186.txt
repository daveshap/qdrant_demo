i feel like no matter how productive i'm being, i can't find satisfaction or "self-solace" for the lack of a better term. nothing feels right
i have multiple hobbies that pursue, and have been pursuing for years now. i work a fulltime job making $23.50 an hour and provide for my family and then some.

i'm 20 years of age and i feel stuck. stuck with my life situation and where and when i should go do things in life. my brain seemingly lacks the ability to be "comfortably relaxed" unjustifiable relaxation feels SOOO wasteful to me and maybe that's just how i am dunno. i feel really stupid writing this as this is biting into time that i could spend being productive. why am i here? sometimes my brain enters this super existential state wherein i feel nothing can be accomplished and everything i am currently doing, and all i am striving for is for naught and it'll never be tangible.

writing this out here regardless of whether or not anyone reads it will help me i think, just letting whatever feeling this is out into some sort of outlet. sorry if poorly formatted or if there are any typos present
