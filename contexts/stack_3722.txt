small sample size with Likert data I have 5 point Likert scale answers to questions and I want to compare the results for 2 practice types.  I have only 17 respondents from one type so I believe my best approach is the Fisher exact test.  The articles I can find that do something like this seem to just look at the responses for agree &amp; strongly agree.  I'm assuming they must be running the test with # A/SA responses and the number of all other responses (neutral, disagree and strongly disagree).  So if there are 2 categories, they have a 2x2 matrix of data they are testing for each question.On the one hand it seems like you'd want to you all of the data you have an not condense it down so much.  On the other hand, by doing that you're making it easier to reach significance because you're distinguishing between all of the Likert values, where you weren't before.  And this test doesn't understand that the data is ordinal, which means you're losing information.  Are these simply limitations of what I can do with this data?  Should I use the 2x2 matrix of data or the 5x2 data (all of the detail)?Thank you!
