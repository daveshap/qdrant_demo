JIM: Morning honey.
DIANE: Dad, I'm so glad I went. Goodnight.
JIM: Wait a minute. How was Lloyd?
DIANE: Lloyd was such a gentleman. He was funny and nervous and strange, and I met people that I never would have met before, then I blew it. I called him basic. Can you believe I did that?
JIM: Well, I don't think he's really been embarrassed by it.
DIANE: Goodnight.
JIM: Goodnight.
COREY: Lloyd is doomed.
DC: Meaning?
COREY: Meaning that she made the second date a family audition, which is the kiss of death for Lloyd.
REBECCA: Why?
COREY: It's too much pressure, it's not his crowd.
REBECCA: What is wrong with this girl?
DC: I told him to be himself.
COREY: He's got that nervous talking thing. I told him not to speak.
REBECCA: Hey, I know this is a strange thing to say, but maybe Diane Court really likes Lloyd.
COREY: If you were Diane Court, would you honestly fall for Lloyd?
