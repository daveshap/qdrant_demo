My cousin attempted suicide.
My cousin just attempted to commit suicide by overdose on pills. He was home on break, where I assume he took the pills, and when my other cousin stopped by to pick him up he found him in the driveway having a seizure. They called the ambulance and brought him to the nearest hospital in a nearby town. No one really knew why he was rushed to the hospital besides the fact that he was having a seizure. When I had the chance to visit him I walked in on him crying with his mother saying, "I'm just so tired of this life. Why does it have to be so hard?" It hit me really hard hearing him say those words. I held his hand and cried with him. It just really baffles me why he would want to end his life. I've been constantly thinking about seeing him like that since yesterday.
