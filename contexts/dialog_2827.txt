OSBORNE: Nunez was chasing Dunbar.
KENDALL: Because he'd shot Mueller.
OSBORNE: But you didn't see it, right?
KENDALL: Like I said, I was in the kitchen. When I came out, Mueller and Pike were dead, Nunez and Childs were hit and Dunbar was gone.
HARDY: Why did he come back for you?
KENDALL: I honestly don't know. Maybe to have someone to cover for him. And I wish I could, but there's no doubt in my mind he killed those men.
HARDY: Okay. I think that's it. He rises and walks to the door.
KENDALL: Mr. Hardy?
