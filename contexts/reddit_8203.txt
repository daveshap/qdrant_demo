Trump announced new tariffs on steel and aluminum today. How can the President do that?
[Trump told business leaders his plans.](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/01/business/trump-tariffs.html) [Equities dropped.](http://money.cnn.com/2018/03/01/investing/dow-jones-trump-tariffs/index.html) How does the President unilaterally impose tariffs?

[The most infamous US tariff was Smoot-Hawley, a piece of legislation signed by President Hoover.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoot%E2%80%93Hawley_Tariff_Act) What changed to allow Presidents to impose new tariffs without Congressional consent? What are some separation of powers/checks and balances concerns?
