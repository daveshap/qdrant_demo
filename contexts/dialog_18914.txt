VADA: People said she looked like me.
ALFRED: I was drinking a little in those days. I'm drinking a little these days too.
VADA: I'm sure she found your lectures fascinating.
ALFRED: Oh I doubt it...lectures are notoriously boring.
VADA: No they're not. I wanna be a writer, I wanna be just like you.
ALFRED: Humph, meee?? My dear, this is not a country that rewards poetry, this is a country that rewards gas mileage, besides, people don't read poetry anymore, they watch television. Don't be a poet, be a TV repairman.
