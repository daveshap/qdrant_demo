WARNER: C'mon. Let me take you home.
ELLE: No.
WARNER: Elle -- it's twenty miles back to campus.
WARNER: Elle, believe me, I never expected to be doing this, but I think it's the right thing to do.
ELLE: How can it be the right thing if we're not together?
WARNER: I have to think about my future. And what people expect from me.
ELLE: So you're breaking up with me because you're afraid your family won't like me? Everybody likes me!
WARNER: East coast people are different.
ELLE: Just because I'm not a Vanderbilt, all of a sudden I'm white trash? I grew up in Bel Air, Warner! Across the street from Aaron Spelling! I think most people would agree that's way better than a Vanderbilt --
WARNER: I told you, Elle. I need someone -- serious.
ELLE: I'm seriously in love with you -- Isn't that enough?
