Do I have the right to be depressed
many friends and family tell me I shouldn't be depressed because i have much more than others. Yes, I am able to eat what i want daily and have lots of people who care and love me. But i just can't help it. 

So do you think i am just...like weak ? or do i have the right to be depressed ?  


(sorry if i couldn't  convey my message exactly how i want it, i am not  a native speaker)
