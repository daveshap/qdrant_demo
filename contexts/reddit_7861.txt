What to do if I hate research
First year PhD student in computational chemistry and hitting the problem (other than balancing classes, research, and life) that I really don't like research. I'm doing a degree because I want to teach undergrad chemistry and I don't like being in lab, but to get the degree I have to do chemistry. While I was applying I thought "eh, it'll just be a few years of research, I'll be fine" but then I get into doing the research and I just flat-out don't like it. It doesn't click with me, I don't have the passion for it that the other students in my research group do, and I have no clue what I would even want to research for a dissertation (although that's quite a ways down the road). Does anyone have ways to make research more likeable/less dreadful, or if I don't like research am I just wasting my time being here?
