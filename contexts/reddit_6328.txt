Programs to assist with relocation for a job when you have no money and crap credit?
I've been out of college for one year and *finally* got my first tentative job offer on the other side of the country.  The problem is, I'm flat broke.  I don't need *much*, just enough to repair my car, move a very, very small amount of belongings, and get me a place to live.  Are there any programs out there to help me with this?  I'm in that stupid catch-22 area where I need money to move, but need a job for money, but the job needs me to move.
