How has the Iranian 'split' from the west fared economically since the Iranian Revolution?
The [Iranian Revolution](https://www.britannica.com/event/Iranian-Revolution-of-1978-1979) was mostly an anti-Western or specifically, anit-American movement that came to overthrow the American-backed Shah. And the relationship with the west has been hit with some ebbs and flows along the way, for instance the table talks during the [Obama administration](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/node/328996), and Iran [doing essentially the reverse travel ban on the US](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/donald-trump-migrant-refugee-ban-muslim-countries-iran-tehran-us-citizens-stopped-entering-country-a7551276.html). 

Recently, Iran has been [aligning with Russia](http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/can-trump-break-up-the-russian-iranian-alliance) and even more recently with [Iraq
](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-iraq-military-idUSKBN1A80HJ). For the latter case, POTUS's view is: 

> "U.S. President Donald Trump has voiced concern over what he sees as growing Iranian influence in conflicts in Syria, Yemen and Iraq, where it is aligned with Shi'ite fighters."

So my question is, how has this anit-western rhetoric affected Iran's economy over the years? and have there been movements among Ayatollah's circles toward a more positive attitude towards the west?
