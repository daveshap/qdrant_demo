LOWRY: I'm, it really doesn't matter. Think C.I.A. and exponentiate. I'm a government employee and I've been watching Jerry for awhile.
LIZA: And Jonas?
LOWRY: He's why I watch Jerry. Jerry's the bait for Jonas.
LIZA: He's shown himself. Why haven't you arrested him or killed him or done whatever it is you do?
LOWRY: Jonas builds assassins for a living. Several of whom may be in place already. We'd like to kill a few birds with one stone.
LIZA: Where do you think Jerry is?
LOWRY: No idea. Honest. What are you going to do?
LIZA: I'm going to find him. Because he'd find me.
LOWRY: Don't go home. And don't go to work. Either one could be bad.
LIZA: What do you suggest?
LOWRY: That you come with me.
LIZA: I don't think so.
