NEDRY: What? No menthol?
DODGSON: Mr Nedry, Mr Nedry. The embryos have to be back here in San Jose by then.
NEDRY: That's up to your guy on the boat. Seven o'clock tomorrow night, at the east dock. Make sure he got it right.
DODGSON: I was wondering, how are you planning to beat the security?
NEDRY: I got an eighteen minute window. Eighteen minutes, and your company catches up on ten years of research.
MALCOLM: So you two dig up dinosaurs?
GRANT: Try to!
HAMMOND: You'll have to get use to Dr. Malcolm! He suffers from a deplorable excess of personality, especially for a mathematician!
MALCOLM: Chaotician, actually! Chaotician!
MALCOLM: John doesn't subscribe to Chaos, particularly what it has to say about his little science project!
HAMMOND: Codswollop! Ian, you've never come close to explaining these concerns of yours about this island!
MALCOLM: I certainly have! Very clearly! Because of the behavior of the system in phase space!
HAMMOND: A load, if I may say so. of fashionable number crunching, thatÂ¹s all it is!
MALCOLM: John, John.
HAMMOND: Don't do that!
MALCOLM: Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler -- you've heard of Chaos Theory?
ELLIE: No.
MALCOLM: No? Non-linear equations? Strange attractions? Dr. Sattler, I refuse to believe that you are not familiar with the concept of attraction!
