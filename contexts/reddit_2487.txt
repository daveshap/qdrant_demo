Is it possible to find a job/career I would like if I hated all my previous ones? What I if I’m the problem
Hi everyone,
For the past 7 years I was unhappy in every single job I had. They were all office jobs in similar fields but very different types of employers (small consulting, large international corporation, educational institution). I tried learning new skills like coding or taking classes in other fields, but I did not enjoy them. I like reading on different topics, but mostly browsing without getting deeply in any topic. I easily get bored and constantly distracted. I am relatively smart and capable, but I often procrastinate because I hate my job and just don’t want to do anything.
I am wondering, is it even possible to find enjoyable work? Or am I the problem?
