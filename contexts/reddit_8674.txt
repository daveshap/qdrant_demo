[META] Announcing an update to Rule 2: "Your source is biased" is not an argument.
Valued participants:

A common tactic in political discussion these days is to discount someone's point by simply accusing their source of bias. This will not fly in r/NeutralPolitics. On its own, "your source is biased" is neither an argument nor a useful contributor to discourse. We also consider it a factual claim, meaning it requires its own source. Accordingly, the bullet points under [Rule 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_rule_2.3A_source_your_facts) have been updated to include the following:

> The charge that a source is biased, inappropriate, or doesn't support the associated claim is itself considered an assertion of fact and therefore requires its own source.

If you believe someone's source is incorrect or inappropriate, *politely* quote the portion of the article that demonstrates your point or provide a [qualified source](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_sources) that does the same. Failure to do so will get your comment removed under [Rule 2.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_rule_2.3A_source_your_facts) There are other subs to discuss media bias.

Thank you.
