DAD: I have some good news for you, Pumpkin.
ENID: What is it now?
DAD: Are you still looking for a job?
ENID: I guess.
DAD: Well, Maxine thinks she can get you a sales job at Computer Station. Normally you have to have references and at least two years of experience, but she thinks she can convince them.
ENID: Tell her to forget it - I don't need her help.
