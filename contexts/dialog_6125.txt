DANTE: Pull my laces tighter.
RANDAL: I've gotta tell you, my friend: this is one of the ballsiest moves I've ever been privy to. I never would have thought you capable of such blatant disregard of store policy.
DANTE: I told him I had a game today. It's his own fault.
RANDAL: No argument here. Insubordination rules.
DANTE: I just want to play hockey like I was scheduled to.
SANFORD: Dante, let me grab a Gatorade.
DANTE: If you grab a Gatorade, then everybody's going to grab one.
SANFORD: So?
DANTE: So? So nobody's going to want to pay for these Gatorades.
SANFORD: What do you care? Hey, what smells like shoe polish?
DANTE: I've got a responsibility here. I can't let everybody grab free drinks.
SANFORD: What responsibility? You're closing the fucking store to play hockey.
RANDAL: He's blunt, but he's got a point.
DANTE: At least let me maintain some semblance of managerial control here.
