KAY: Why are you so cold to her and Carlo? They live with us on the Mall now, but you never get close to them.
MICHAEL: I'm busy.
KAY: Connie and Carlo want you to be godfather to their little boy.
KAY: Will you?

TESSIO: Barzini's people chisel my territory and we do nothing about it. Pretty soon there won't be one place in Brooklyn I can hang my hat.

MICHAEL: Be patient.
CLEMENZA: We gotta fight sometime. Let us at least recruit our regimes to full strength.
MICHAEL: No, I don't want to give Barzini an excuse to start fighting.
