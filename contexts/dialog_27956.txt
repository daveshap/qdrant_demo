THELMA: How much longer is it gonna be? I'm hungry.
LOUISE: Another hour of so. We've got enough food for a month.
THELMA: I'll never make it... Can't we stop just for a few minutes...
LOUISE: We've not gonna get to the cabin till after dark as it is, Thelma.
THELMA: Then what difference does it make if we stop? Come on. I never get to do stuff like this.
