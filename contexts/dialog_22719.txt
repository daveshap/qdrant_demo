JONAH: No.
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE: Why not?
JONAH: It's very hard for him to talk about this stuff. It's like it makes him sadder.
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE: You want me to talk to him?
ANNIE: Perfect. Sandbag the father.
JONAH: And you crazy? He thinks shows like this are dumb. If you didn't have an 800 number I could never get away with this --
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE: Is he home right now?
JONAH: Yeah.
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE: Well, I think I can help a little more if I talk to him directly.
JONAH: I don't know --
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE: I'm sure he won't be angry once he realizes how concerned you are about him.
JONAH: Okay, but if I get yelled at, I'm never gonna listen to this show again.
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE: Fair enough.
JONAH: Dad --
SAM: What is it?
JONAH: There's somebody on the phone for you. His name is Sam.
