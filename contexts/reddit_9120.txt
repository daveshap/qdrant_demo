LPT: Order groceries through Walmart for pick up (it's free) and order store brand items. Whenever they are out of stock you will automatically get upgraded (for free) to name brand items.
If you check "allow substitutes" you can get free upgrades. I just got two packages of oreos for 80 cents each because they were out of the generic cookies.
