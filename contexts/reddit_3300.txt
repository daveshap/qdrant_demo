Can I accept an offer with the intent to leave if I find something better?
I was just offered an internship for Summer 2019. It's a good position, but not my top choice, which doesn't post openings until January. In the offer, they stipulate:
"Your employment is on an “at-will” basis, meaning that both you and the Company are free to terminate the employment relationship at anytime, for any reason,with or without notice, and with or without cause." To me this seems that I could withdraw at any time without repercussions.

If I don't get my top choice, I would be pretty happy with this position, so I don't want to outright say no. Is it in my best interest to accept the position but continue looking for something better and then withdraw if I do get a better offer? Has anyone done something similar to this, because it seems like the best option, but it makes me a little uneasy. Will there be any repercussions to this, legally or more holistically, such as being blacklisted from the company for future positions?
