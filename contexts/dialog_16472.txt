MYSTERY MAN: We've met before, haven't we?
FRED: I don't think so. Where was it that you think we've met?
MYSTERY MAN: At your house. Don't you remember?
FRED: No, no I don't. Are you sure?
MYSTERY MAN: Of course. In fact, I'm there right now.
FRED: What do you mean? You're where right now?
MYSTERY MAN: At your house.
FRED: That's absurd.
