How do you calculate the distance from center for centripetal force equation for long objects such as board or a hammer? I am trying to calculate the centripetal force for an enlongated object like a fan blade.  Where do I measure to to get the distance from center.  Would I measure from the center to the end of the blade?  Also what if I had a mass such as a hammer in circular motion since this is an uneven distribution of mass where would I measure to from the center of rotation to get the distance from center?
