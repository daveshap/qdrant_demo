A creative online short story written about artificial intelligence As best as I can remember the story is about a female protagonist who has grown extremely discontent with her (now) immortal life. She was one of the original programmers who helped create this omnipotent computer which once built, became self-aware, and made \u201cthe change\u201d. Where everyone in reality became virtual gods basically. There was no longer any scarcity, you can think anything into existence, have almost anything you want as long as it doesn\u2019t go against the set rules of the computer. An example of something not allowed is suicide.As our main protagonist is always trying to push the logical boundaries of what can be done, she creates a new sport. This is essentially death games where any challenger can enter into the world of your creation and battle through whatever maze of traps and challenges to win a prize. <blockquote class=\"spoiler\">   Eventually she finds the original creator of the computer, and they realize that the computer has the ability to reverse the original event that made humanity what they are today, so long as the computer deems it is for the greater good of mankind. Through a series of logical loops, they are able to convince it that humanity needs to basically control their own destiny again.</blockquote>
