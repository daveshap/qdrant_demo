HAROLD: Eh, no. Thank you.
MAUDE: You're welcome. Did you know him?
HAROLD: Eh, no.
MAUDE: Me neither. I heard he was eighty years old. I'll be eighty next week. A good time to move on, don't you think?
HAROLD: I don't know.
MAUDE: I mean, seventy-five is too early, but at eighty-five, well, you're just marking time and you may as well look over the horizon.
