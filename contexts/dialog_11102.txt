WHALE: I have a proposal, Mr. Kay. This mode of questioning is getting old, don't you think?
KAY: I don't mind.
WHALE: Let's make it more interesting. I will answer any question you ask. But, for each answer, you must remove one article of clothing.
KAY: That's funny, Mr. Whale.
WHALE: It is, isn't it? My life as a game of strip poker. Shall we play?
KAY: You're serious.
WHALE: Quite.
KAY: Then the rumors are true?
WHALE: What rumors might those be?
KAY: That you were forced to retire because, uh -- a sex scandal.
WHALE: A homosexual scandal, you mean? For me to answer a question of that magnitude, you'll have to remove both your shoes and your socks.
