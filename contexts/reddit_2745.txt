How do I approach a lead whose "jokes" about me messing up/being unproductive are starting to wear on me and make it worse?
Ever since my coworkers and I started working from home about a month ago, I've had a really hard time staying focused. I have been diagnosed with ADHD by several different doctors, but my psychiatrist refuse to medicate or discuss other behavioral options with me because I don't think she believes the diagnosis/thinks I'm just "on my phone too much"... So I've relied really strongly on the external structure of a workplace environment and co-workers around to keep me focused. Since that doesn't exist anymore, I'm falling apart. I'm making more mistakes, being less productive, pretty much a slew of fireable mistakes if I wasn't working in an industry that doesn't really fire people.

One of the leads I do occasional work for has always needled me, and I could probably write an entirely separate advice post about his other behavior towards me. However lately, he's started making jokes about my mistakes... Saying things like "you messed up... again? :)" on a daily basis. I can take a joke, but the same one made every day when I *am* trying to find ways to create structure and stay focused is really wearing on me. 

It's already upsetting to be letting people down constantly, I want to do a good job and it's humiliating. But the jabs are getting to me and obviously making it worse, as I'm posting on Reddit instead of working. How do I get him to stop? (Other than not screwing up...which I'm working on...)
