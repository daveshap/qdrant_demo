I might lose my dad soon.
I will try to make this short but informative. Sorry in advance.
My dad hurt his knee a log time ago and about 8 years ago we decided to do replacement knee surgery for him. After this surgery his knee was never right, it got infected SEVERAL times since then and he has 5 different surgery's on that knee since then. They had to replace the parts with different material-ed parts and also surgically clean it for infection several times. -=-=--=-=-=-=-=-=- Well, he came down with a bit of a fever and flu like symptons but was able to get over that, but shortly after he couldnt put any pressure on that knee ( about a week and half ago) So my mother took him a doctor who said it was Staph infection and sent him with pain meds only (Should they have put him on antibiotics?) and told him to come back on Tuesday (this was Sunday). They mentioned nothing was wrong with kidney's or liver or even that he had any infection in his blood stream at this point. -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- So, when we brought him back on Tuesday (scheduled surgery to clean it out on tuesday) they found that the infection was in his blood stream and his kidney's were failing. -=-=-=-=-=-=- The doctors did the surgery on his knee to clean the infection out and were hoping this was the cause of the kidneys failing. His Kidney's continued to get worse, the only good news we got since this began was that the infection levels in his blood stream LOWERED but were not gone. -=-=-=-=-=-=-  They did Dialysis and it did not do much to help his kidney's but did remove a LOT of fluids from him. A few days later they noticed the infection back in his knee and also his livers were starting to fail .... This is where we made the hard choice to Amputate his leg. At this point we could try to clean it again and give it time, but with all the surgeries he has had to clean it and now his livers failing ... we thought it was the best idea .... 


-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- So he had his leg Amputated at 5pm on Xmas (last night) and since this his blood pressure has dropped dramatically - and he has excessive bleeding. They put in 3 pints of blood over night last night and this morning they transferred him to the ICU to see if they can stable him ... 

Should they have started antibiotics as soon as they figured it was Staph? Did we make the right choice to amputate? Does he even have a chance at this point?
