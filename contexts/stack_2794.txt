Pressurized tank emptying over time through a given area I having difficulty wrapping my head around a concept that I wish to solve. There exists a 10L tank of compressed air at 100psi. When an outlet hole of cross-sectional area of 0.115 $in^2$ is opened, I wish to develop a curve of pressure vs. time from $t=0$ until pressure drops from 100psi to atmospheric (0 psi). Many things can be neglected in this situation, such as friction etc., since I would like a general curve to compare with experimental data. I am unsure of how to apply fluid dynamics to a vessel that empties simply due to its own pressure difference through an area.Temperature can be assumed to be constant at 25C as well.
