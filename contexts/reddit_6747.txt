Grunenthal - scam?
Hello.

I got a text that a company that said they'd viewed my resume on ZipRecruiter.

We did a text-only interview via Google Hangouts and I got the job.

But it seems fishy. They told me of about 20 different positions, all seemed to offer the same pay.

The interview was minimal, they seemed very excited to hire me (based on pretty much nothing) and are going to send me a cheque with which I can buy equipment to start working from home.

They're located in Germany but are building a location near me (Canada) but I had to remind her what country I was in.

Thoughts?
