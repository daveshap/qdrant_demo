My brother killed himself and I am about to do the same thing
This is the short version of my story 
So I had an older brother. I had one. He was always depressed. He even tried to kill him self but he was stopped my parents. That happened about 2 years ago (I was 14, I’ve recently turned 16). One month later he somehow got my fathers gun, a shotgun. He then shot him self in the head. I rushed to his room and saw his exploded head. Since then I’ve never said a word and now im not able to speak anymore (im mute because of the trauma, its called selective mutism if you want to look it up.) and I am extremely depressed. Everytime I close my eyes I see the image of my dead brother with his head blown off. I have multiple panic attacks everyday. I don’t want to talk to my friends or family(by „talk“ I mean communicate not literally talk.). I can’t do this anymore. Im sitting with a knife next to me. I don’t know if I should do it. 

Please help me

Edit: thank you all for being so positive, it helped. I put the knife away and I will try to sleep for a bit.

Thanks to each and every single one of you

Edit 2: Thank you for the gold.
I also want to thank every person that has offered me to talk with them, I really appreciate it.

Edit 3: its bad. I had a panic attack and cut myself. 

Edit 4: a day since posting. Im still alive but not in a good state

Edit 5: still alive, my parents will be home tomorrow I will talk to them about therapy 

Edit 6: This is the final edit. I tried to kill myself.
I cut myself pretty bad and almost died. im okay now and im going to therapy. Thanks for the support.
