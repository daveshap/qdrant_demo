“Have you made any plans to kill yourself?”
Difficult question to answer doc.

I’ve planned how I’d do it in detail thousand of times, but have I planned it in the sense of how I’d plan to go to the mall and buy a new coat on Tuesday evening? No.

No timeframe, just a very detailed get-out clause for if I stop being able to handle this bullshit life any more. So I don’t know if that counts as making plans or not.
