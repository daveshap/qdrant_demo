I learned the hard way... Interview Advice / RANT
I'm an Art Director/Graphic Designer in New York City, arguably one of the most competitive arenas in the biz. After applying for a position, 1st, 2nd and then 3rd interview, meeting over 10 people in the company, touring the office, yada yada... I didn't get the job. 

I learned quite a few things in the process and after living the disappointment, here I am, here's what I learned (from feedback and self reflection): 

- The interview process is a game, and a competition of sorts. There are other people in it to win it! Don't let your guard down, and don't get comfortable. The moment you begin to get cocky, feel like you have the job, feel like you are winning and think you are getting positive feedback, you need to SLOW YOUR ROLL. All those intuitions may be true, but until paperwork is signed, nothing is final. 

- Be honest, but tell them what they want to hear at the same time. I mean... you need to work on phrasing strengths, weaknesses, fears, excitements in a way that is professional and appealing.  

- Make sure you KNOW the position and all the duties before you go into an interview! This will help SIGNIFICANTLY. You can even rephrase some of the requirements as items you are skilled at. Do not ever walk into an interview without clear expectations, otherwise you are walking into a deathtrap of uncertainty. 

- NEVER discuss title or money until they actually offer you a position, and want to know your "magic" number. Don't even mention it in passing. A time will come for this, but it may not happen until after 3+ interviews. ** If they ask where you see yourself in the company, never name positions, or titles-- focus on the big picture. 

- Care more about the company than your own needs. Be more interested in the team, office atmosphere, and good work, than your personal gain. 

- Never talk about your personal life unless it is directly relevant. Small talk is perfectly acceptable, but avoid the 3: politics, sex, religion. Don't ever make your social life seem important. Your family, friends, things you do are irrelevant unless they are specifically asked about. 

- Try to always do your interviews in person! Phone, Skype, etc. can skew people's perspective of you and body language is very hard to read!

And just some of the tough questions I was asked:

1. Where do you see yourself in 3 years?

2. What do you fear the most if you started working here?

3. Have you ever worked with/managed a team?

4. What was your most challenging project?
