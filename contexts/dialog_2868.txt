OSBORNE: What are you doing out here?
HARDY: Leaving without saying goodbye. What are you gonna do?
OSBORNE: Go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
HARDY: Think it'll work?
OSBORNE: Nah.
HARDY: Want company?
OSBORNE: A word of advice about women -- that first hour or so after they kill their boss? Probably not the best time to hit on them.
HARDY: I should probably write that down.
OSBORNE: Yeah.
OSBORNE: Your phone number?
HARDY: In case you need me to testify about the shooting. They'll clear you.
OSBORNE: He was your friend.
HARDY: Yeah. But he was a lot of other things, too. Thanks.
