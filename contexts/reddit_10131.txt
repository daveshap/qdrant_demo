Appeal Critique
Hi everyone. I messed up and got dismissed from my program at University. I need help with my appeal and would appreciate if people could provide some input on mine. Thank you!!

&#x200B;

Dear XXX,

I am writing this letter to appeal my academic dismissal from XXX program. Although I am not surprised by the decision, I am extremely upset to receive the letter of dismissal earlier this week informing me of this news. I am writing this letter with hope that I can still continue my journey in the Doctor of Pharmacy program. I would like to thank you for the opportunity to explain the circumstances that led to this decision. 

&#x200B;

This past year, I admit that I had a very difficult time and my grades have greatly suffered as a result. I went into my second year not knowing about the difficulty of all the classes I was registered in. Looking back, I realized I tried to balance too much this past year. I worked many hours at my job to be able to pay for tuition, rent, and necessities like groceries. The number of hours I worked cut into the time I had to study. I also tried to stay involved in extracurricular activities, such as clubs. Overall, my workload was too much for me to handle. I realize that I should have spoken to more people for support. In regard to balancing my schedule, I understand now that I should have made appointments with CASE more often to discuss how I should balance my schedule. I acknowledge and take full responsibility for what I previously stated, but I am taking all the steps I can in order to achieve the future I want. 

&#x200B;

I have fallen in love with XXX University and all that it has to offer, and it would mean the world to me to be able to continue to pursue my XXX degree. If I am given the opportunity, I will most importantly focus more on my schoolwork, work fewer hours, and manage my time more wisely. In order to improve my academic performance, I anticipate achieving the following:

&#x200B;

1.	Improvement Recognition: I have improved my grades from Fall 2018 by focusing harder and working smarter in Spring 2019. My GPA has increased by 0.203, an 8.9% increase. Given the chance, I surely know that I will be able to achieve this again. I have certainly worked harder in the last portion of the spring semester, and I will attach a conversation I had with Professor XXX that shows my improvement in my work habits. I would continue this academic growth into and throughout my professional years with the use of tutors and more hours dedicated to studying.

&#x200B;

2.	Additional Help/Resources:  I will continue to seek the help from my peer advisors, supervisors, tutors and attend “after hours” sessions. Historically, I have sought the guidance from XXX for Organic Chemistry I. I attended four of her Supplemental Instruction sessions and it helped me tremendously. Specifically, she helped me understand addition reactions, substitution and elimination, and many more concepts. After attending these sessions, I received a higher score on my final exam compared to previous exams. To continue this momentum, I will also seek a tutor for the more challenging classes I will undertake such as Organic Chemistry II.

&#x200B;

In addition, I frequently communicate and visit with my advisor, XXX, and discuss with her how to jumpstart my path to success in the future. I also plan on visiting Dean XXX for advice and guidance. I have recently emailed him to schedule days we can meet and chat about my future success. Since I am a first-generation student, I felt I did not have someone close to help guide me, but taking advantage of using faculty as mentors to assist me has pushed me in the right direction

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

3.	Summer Course Enrollment: I will be taking Organic Chemistry II and retaking Medical Microbiology. If I am given the opportunity to take these classes, I will definitely be able to obtain the 2.7 GPA requirement. I have proven my success through summer courses, as last year I was in a similar situation. I wanted to improve my GPA; therefore, I retook Introduction to Psychology. I received a C+ during Spring 2018. When I retook the course during Summer 2018, I received an A which improved my GPA by 0.113, a 4.2% increase.

&#x200B;

In addition, I plan on working during the summer to help save money. This leads me to my payment plan.

&#x200B;

4.	New Tuition Payment Plan: I discussed a more strategic payment plan with my family that will allow me to still afford tuition at XXX while also allowing me to allocate more of my schedule to my schoolwork and less of my schedule to external work. By lifting some of the financial burden from my plate, I can dedicate my time and efforts towards my academic goals.

&#x200B;

Although my grades have not yet shown it, I truly am a good student that had a very difficult year juggling my financial and academic commitments. I hope I will be able to receive the opportunity for a second chance. These years are not just about learning academically, but learning about oneself, and growing as an adult. This experience has helped me see that. Thank you again for considering my appeal, and I sincerely hope to continue the path to my XXX degree with your approval.

&#x200B;

Sincerely,

XXX
