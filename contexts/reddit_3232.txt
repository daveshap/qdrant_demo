New employer left me hanging a day before start date. They admitted fault. I'm left hanging and jobless. What are my options?
I had made a post on this previously but didn't get much traction.  Basically, I was hired for a position that requires government security clearance.  All prerequisites completed and both HR and new supervisor said I was good to start work.  The Sunday before start date they found someone had dropped the ball on some records changes.  2 days later i'm told it can't be resolved and to look for another job.  Both boss and HR admitted fault.  This is in Ohio (at will state).  I don't think I can get unemployment because I resigned from my previous employer.  Do I have any rights here?  What are my options?

FYI:

Going back to previous my previous employer is not an option because of personal reasons (I did leave on good terms)
