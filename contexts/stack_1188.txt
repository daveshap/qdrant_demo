MongoDB - Split brain with 3 DC I have mongoDB in 3 DC's.DC1 - 3 Nodes  with priority 300DC2 - 3 Nodes  with priority 200DC3 - 3 Nodes  with priority 100Questions :-Say, N/W is broken b/w DC1 &amp; DC2. But, still DC1 is able to communicate with DC3 and DC2 is also able to communicate with DC3. But DC1 will not be able to DC2.          Will it create 2 Primaries here, like 1 PRIMARY from DC1 and 1 PRIMARY from DC2?What if there is no Priorities? Only DC3 will become PRIMARY?Thanks
