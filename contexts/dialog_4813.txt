MARCUS: Okay, what happened?
DRUMMER: He's going to be all right, right?
MARCUS: No. He's dead.
DRUMMER: No way, man.
MARCUS: He's dead and there's nothing we can do. Come on, Frank, that's it.
FRANK: He's not dead. It's a heroin overdose. Break out the Narcon.
MARCUS: He's dead unless you folks want to stop bullshitting me and tell it straight. Then, Lord willing, we'll try to bring him back.
