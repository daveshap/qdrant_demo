I don’t know how to keep going.
This week I was sent to the hospital for an attempt, lost a relationship, burned a lot of friendships, damaged my car, and scared the hell out of my family-who now knows I’m depressed. My friends don’t see me, they don’t understand, they aren’t there for me at all. Those that are there I feel like I’m reaching the point of annoyance with. I can’t sleep, can’t eat, can’t focus on anything other than the way I’ve failed everyone around me. I’m trying so very very hard to hold on, but I don’t know how much longer I can keep this up. I can’t see a positive end to any of this. I just want to disappear. I just need someone to care.

Edit: 
To everyone who offered kind words, understanding, and advice, I thank you from the bottom of my heart. This is my first ever reddit post and I am blown away by the amount of support I have received. Truly a beautiful thing to feel so loved by total strangers.
