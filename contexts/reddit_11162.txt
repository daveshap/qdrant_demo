I’m probably never going back to high school before I graduate... thanks COVID-19
Hello, I’m normally not one to complain about what’s going on in my life on a subreddit, but this quarantine is really messing with me lol

I’m a senior in high school and tomorrow my state is going to announce the fate of public schools. I have a feeling that I’m not going to return to school and that really bothers me for some reason. I hate my school, I don’t really like a lot of the people who go to my school, and I don’t have too many friends, but for some reason I feel sad. I never got to say goodbye. I left my school a week ago, completely oblivious to the fact how that could be my last day there. I never got to say goodbye to teachers and some friends I only keep contact with there. AND graduation could not only be delayed, but cancelled. I know COVID-19 is very serious and keeps getting worse and worse, but I just wish I had at least 1 week... heck 1 more day of school just to say my farewell to people and the building before I start my new life as a college student (if the virus doesn’t ruin that too)

I know there are soooo many other things to worry about in this world and this just sounds pathetic but I just felt like letting this out.

Anyone out there in this situation and feeling the same way? 

WASH YOUR HANDS!!
