VAUGHN: Martin, it could be anything.
BRODY: What the hell does it take to make sense to you numbskulls? Jesus, it's right there in front of you. I know what a goddamn shark looks like, I've been through it, don't you understand? I've seen this sonofabitch before!
PETERSON: What have you seen before? This is nothing. Seaweed. Mud. Some- thing in the lens.
BRODY: My ass!
VAUGHN: Be reasonable, please....
PETERSON: Forget it, he won't listen.
BRODY: There is nothing to discuss.
PETERSON: Will you listen to this man? Will you just listen to him? You really caused a panic on a public beach, you shoot up the place, God knows who could've been injured -- what if somebody de- cides to sue us? That could ruin us.
BRODY: Is that what it is? Dollars? Money? I'll pay for it. Take it out of my salary.
PETERSON: You don't make enough.
BRODY: Maybe I don't make as much money as some bullshit rip-off artists around here, but I don't work the same way.
PETERSON: What's that supposed to mean?
BRODY: It means I don't like all that grab-ass and heavy breathing with my wife, it means I know who's out to screw me here, and it means that I know something none of you know because I've been there -- and I don't want to go through that horror again. Ever!
VAUGHN: Martin, could you wait here for a few minutes while we make up our minds about something?
BRODY: Go ahead, whatever it's worth.
