"But you are so attractive you have no reason to have social anxiety and depression."
I know it's not the correct sub but why the hell do so many fuckheads say that shit?

* Yes I have a mirror
* Yes I care about my hygiene and looks because I learned it that way and it's hard to dislearn something like eating with a fork and knife
* Yes I hit the gym every other day 

But why the fuck does that have something to do with my mental health?

I'm a male and it's already hard af to hide your feelings in public because of social pressure (at least in Germany) but shit like that is driving me mad if people think that being attractive makes you imune against depression and so on.

Has anyone ever encountered shit like that?
