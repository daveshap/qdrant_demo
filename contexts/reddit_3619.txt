If you’re not at ease on a date, leave but please be polite about it.
Honestly I’m dumbfounded.
I (23F) met this guy on tinder a few weeks back. After a fortnight of texting, sexting, sending photos, we agreed on a date to meet. He was really excited and told me multiples times how he « could not wait ». 
Which happened. We met. 
Guy arrives at my house and we have a nice little chat for about an hour. Honestly I think it was going well. No sloppy subjects, no blanks in the conversation, he looked relaxed and so did I. Then he suddenly hits me with:
« Okay. I don’t want to be here. It pisses me off. I’m leaving. ». I was so, so, so surprised. We were having a chat, and right in the middle of it, he just... said that. 


And there goes my fucking rant: you have every right to feel uncomfortable and every right to leave, I left many dates myself. But I always managed to do it in the most tactful way and polite manner (like: « Sorry, I don’t think this is working, I’ll be leaving now. Thanks for the night »)

I can handle rejection, but what I can’t handle is feeling like shit because my date is leaving w/o explanations and in the rudest way possible.
It happened yesterday, and I’ve spent all day and most part of the night wondering if I did something wrong to deserve such a nasty comment. 

Please, please, please, if you want to leave a date, please do, but don’t be rude about it. I still don’t understand what went wrong, most likely never will and I feel terrible.
