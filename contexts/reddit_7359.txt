Negotiating salary at a startup--what to expect? [x-post r/personalfinance]
I've just finished a long and very involved series of interviews for a startup sales position. This is a total career shift for me, but I have years of experience in another field that will translate very well to this position. I should find out next steps next week and want to be prepared in case I'm given an offer.  

Looking on AngelList and Glassdoor, I'm estimating salary would be between $50-75k (likely toward the lower end). Right now I'm making $60K and am hoping my next position will start out around $65k.  

My questions are:  

* If I'm given a lower offer than expected--say, closer to $40k--would it be inappropriate to counter with a number as high as my current salary of $60k? Should I be upfront about wanting $65k?  

* If I'm asked to tell them what my salary requirements would be, how do I avoid low-balling myself? Could I hurt myself by coming in too high?  

* I've been reading many articles about how equity works at startups and I'm still not sure how this might factor into an offer. This startup finished a very successful Series B funding round earlier this year and is in a period of rapid growth. I've read different things about how this will impact equity and salary offers.  

Any insight or personal experiences would be helpful. I'm moving into this world from the nonprofit sector and this is all brand new to me.
