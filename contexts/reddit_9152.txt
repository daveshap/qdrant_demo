If your state has not expanded unemployment, please consider the following:

* APPLY ANYWAY - the number of applicants may force the government to take action to deal with the financial burden in their state.

* Contact your Governor's Office and request that he take action

* Contact your state representatives (state government, not federal) and ask that they take action to push the governor

* REMEMBER THIS at voting time next election if your state refuses to take action and vote in your state elections, not just the federal ones.

I won't be able to keep up with any legislation changes on a state by state basis, it's just too much for me and I'm still (thankfully) working full-time, so I've tried my best to link to pages that should update if things change. Check your state government's website frequently for social programs started or expanded to help, including SNAP/WIC/TANF benefits, or disability benefits if you get sick.

Edited to add: Thank you for all your nice comments. And thank you for pointing out I forgot Virginia, sorry about that, I had a long list! I also fixed South Carolina's link
