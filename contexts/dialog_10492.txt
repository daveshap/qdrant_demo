CHILI: A marker's like a check, Harry.
HARRY: I know what a marker is.
CHILI: They don't want to deposit yours and have it bounce. That annoys them. So your dear friend Dick Allen's been calling, leaving messages on your machine, but you never get back to him. I happen to be in Vegas on another matter, and Dick asks me as a favor would I look you up. I follow you over here, see you in the window with this woman, looks a lot like that actress Karen Flores, was in Grotesque, except she's not blond anymore...
CHILI: You're not looking at me, Harry.
HARRY: Why do I have to keep looking at you?
CHILI: I want you to.
HARRY: You gonna get rough now, threaten me? I make good by tomorrow or get my legs broken?
CHILI: Come on, Harry -â€“ Mesas? The worst they might do is get a judgment against you, uttering a bad check. I can't imagine you want that to happen, man in your position.
HARRY: Fuckin' basketball game.
