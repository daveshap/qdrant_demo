PENTANGELI: Sure, Pete Clemenza died of a heart attack, but the Rosato Brothers gave it to him.
MICHAEL: We were all heartbroken at the news; but that wasn't cause to start a war.
PENTANGELI: Okay, now it's my family in Brooklyn; and I wanna keep up Clemenza's loyalty to you. But how can I run my family with you challenging my every move? You're too far from the street, Mike, the only way to reason with the Rosato Brothers is to whack 'em and whack 'em fast.
MICHAEL: You were unfair with them.
PENTANGELI: Says who?
MICHAEL: Clemenza promised Rosato three territories in the Bronx after he died, and then you took over and welched.
PENTANGELI: Clemenza promised them nothing, he hated the sonsuvbitches.
MICHAEL: They feel cheated.
PENTANGELI: Michael, you're sitting up here in the Sierra Mountains with champagne cocktails making judgment on the way I run my family.
MICHAEL: Your family still carries the name Corleone, and you will run it like a Corleone!
PENTANGELI: And while I feed my family in New York, you put the knife in my back in Miami.
MICHAEL: Frankie, you're a good old man, and you've been loyal to my Father for years...so I hope you can explain what you mean.
PENTANGELI: The Rosatos are running crazy; taking hostages, spitting in my face, because they're backed by the Jew in Miami.
MICHAEL: I know. That's why I want you to be fair with them.
PENTANGELI: How can you be fair with animals? They recruit niggers and spicks; they do violence in their own Grandmother's neighborhoods. And everything is dope and whores; the gambling is left to last. Let me run my family without you on my back. I want them taken care of.
MICHAEL: No. There are things that I have planned with Hyman Roth. I don't want them disturbed.
PENTANGELI: You give your loyalty to a Jew over your own blood.
MICHAEL: Frankie, you know my father respected Roth, did business with him.
PENTANGELI: He did business...but he never trusted him.
