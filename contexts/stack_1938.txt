How to refer to a city (or town) that is not on the coast? How could one convey the idea that a place is \u201cin the middle\u201d of the geographic area of a country, thus far from the seaside \u2014 whether city or town, rural or urban?The fact that it\u2019s a city or town or rural or urban is not relevant. The only relevant information would be: far from the sea; non-coastal.This word (or phrase, expression) would be used in sentences like this: \u201cI don\u2019t go to the beach very often, I live [...]\u201d \u2014 without needing to say one\u2019s exact location or explain too much, if possible.Does such straightforward expression (preferably a single word) exist?
