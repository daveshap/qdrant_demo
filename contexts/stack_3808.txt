How to get cross-validated correlation estimate? I have a logistic regression model trained on an outcome variable $y$ and I want to get an estimate of how good the predicted raw probabilities are in terms of aligning with $y$. I realize that logistic regression probabilities should not be expected to show a linear trend with the outcome variable but I would imagine that if it was well-trained, there might be a strong rank correlation at least.Either way, whether this is a linear or logistic model, what is the best way to assess the correlated strength in a generalizable way? I though about doing 10-fold cross validation and testing the spearman correlation in each fold and averaging those but I don't know if that makes any sense. Is there a better way to do this? Thanks.
