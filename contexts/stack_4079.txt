Will I be able to re enter canada even though I was there 2 months ago on a visa (IEC)? I'm an Australian that has worked in Canada before and my visa(IEC) has expired(March 2018) and I am not able to renew. Which is fine, but my problem is that I want to return to vacation in July 2018 (just two months)and to tie up some loose ends e.g collect personal belongings and shut down my bank account that I had while working in Canada, as well as do a little travelling with friends. So i'm wondering if this is going to hinder my chances of being able to re enter Canada.And if there is actually a specific time frame you are supposed to spend outside the country before returning. If anyone could shed some light on the situation it would be much appreciated, Thank you.
