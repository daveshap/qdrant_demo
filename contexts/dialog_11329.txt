SKYLAR: You suck.
WILL: What?
SKYLAR: I've been sitting over there for forty- five minutes waiting for you to come talk to me. But I'm just tired now and I have to go home and I wasn't going to keep sitting there waiting for you.
WILL: I'm Will.
SKYLAR: Skylar. And by the way. That guy over there is a real dick and I just wanted you to know he didn't come with us.
WILL: I kind of got that impression.
SKYLAR: Well, look, I have to go. Gotta' get up early and waste some more money on my overpriced education.
WILL: I didn't mean you. Listen, maybe...
SKYLAR: Here's my number.
WILL: Great, or maybe we could go somewhere and just eat a bunch of caramels.
SKYLAR: What?
WILL: When you think about it, it's just as arbitrary as drinking coffee.
SKYLAR: Okay, sounds good.
WILL: Five minutes.
SKYLAR: What?
WILL: I was trying to be smooth. But at twelve-fifteen I was gonna come over there and talk to you.
SKYLAR: See, it's my life story. Five more minutes and I would have got to hear your best pick-up line.
WILL: The caramel thing is my pick-up line.
