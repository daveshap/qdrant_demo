I feel left out.
Ever since I was little, I've been the kid that was left out of everything. I was the kid all of the family members have picked on.

Since then, I have grown a lot of confidence and changed my life dramatically, but for some reason, I feel the need to be "special" or the best at something in order for me to not feel left out.

What sparked this feeling yesterday when I had dance rehearsal for my dance team. We have a show this weekend and I have a set of best friends that I associate myself with. During the show, there is a solo that one of my best friends is choreographing for and he is allowed a couple of people to do it with. Out of the 4 of us, 1 being the choreographer, he chose the other 2 and not me. 

This makes me feel inadequate in my skills to perform and makes me think about my relationship with my best friend as I support him in everything he does. He even taught the piece last tuesday and I drove 45 min to support him while the other 2 didn't even show up. Thinking about it, he didn't even go to my graduation or really supports me in anyway. Feels like he just uses me to smoke.

I just sucks, and I hate feeling this way.
