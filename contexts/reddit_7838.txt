How to ask professor to co-author a research project/article
Background: I am 1st year PhD student (social science field) & need advice on whether I should ask a professor to work on a project with me. 

I just finished a course that opened my eyes to a whole new area of research that has yet to be explored. My final paper for this class highlighted all the areas for future research and my professor seemed to be interested. 

I emailed my professor after and told him I am interested in researching the topic & asked about a potential dataset. He responded and made it sound like the dataset I found could work, and then said he could provide me advice if I were to use the dataset. 

Would it be weird to respond and ask the professor if we could turn a part of my final paper into a research project (with him co-authoring)? 

My only dilemma is that I am currently assigned to a different professor to conduct research with, but this research project isn't really my assigned professor's area of research.  So I don't know if I should present this idea to the professor I'm assigned to or to the professor that taught the class... 

Any advice/suggestions would be greatly appreciated!! I have never gone to a professor with a research idea before, so I don't really know how to approach this/ask correctly...
