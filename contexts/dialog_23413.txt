MRS. CORTEZ: Is it about Jacqueline?
JUDD: No. She's no longer under my care.
JUDD: I don't know how to begin this, Natalie. Perhaps it's best to just plunge in. I want to join you.
MRS. CORTEZ: We always knew you'd come to us, Louis.
JUDD: But I'm not coming to you out of deep conviction, I'm coming to you out of loss. I no longer can believe in the power and the rightness of things that are called good.
MRS. CORTEZ: I never thought you did.
JUDD: I've talked nonsense. I've scoffed and hooted -- but somewhere very deep down in me, I always felt that good held the balance of power.
MRS. CORTEZ: You're even sentimental about it. What made you change your mind?
