Work schedule?
Hey! I don’t know if I can post this here but I am really new at my job, I’ve been looking for a job for like 1 year and finally gotten one. 
I’m just 18, and still in school. 
My job has an app to handle work schedules and such, and I’ve just gotten a looot of work. 
At least more than I thought I would get according to the job info. 
I have no issue working it’s just that when I already go to school 8 hours a day, and then work until midnight, and then opening shift at 11 in the morning the next day(weekend) I feel a bit overwhelmed.. 

To sum it up; my question is, am I allowed to talk to my boss and ask if we could work out my job schedule together? At least in the start and explain what would work best for me? Or would that be considered rude for a new employee?
