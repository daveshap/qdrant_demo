KILLIAN: Master Crane, sir. I'm glad we have time alone. You've been told plenty about the Horseman, I'm certain.
ICHABOD: More than enough, actually. I beg you, no more, please.
KILLIAN: No, sir, no. If you ask me, I say you just laid eyes on our murderer through that glass.
ICHABOD: Tell me something. What becomes of Young Masbath?
KILLIAN: Van Ripper and his wife agreed to take him. They have children and a good home and good land.
