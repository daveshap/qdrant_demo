MARY LAZARUS: Mary Clarence, are you with us?
CHRISTY: Um, I don't really know this one...
MARY ROBERT: Mary Clarence has a background in music. That's what Reverend Mother said.
MARY PATRICK: Really, Mary Clarence? Were you a choirmistress?
CHRISTY: Sure. Kind of... free-lance.
MARY LAZARUS: Free-lance? Oh really? You think I don't see? You think I took vows yesterday? I know what you're up to. You and Reverend Mother.
CHRISTY: What?
MARY LAZARUS: You're a ringer. She brought you in to replace me. Out with the old.
CHRISTY: Hold on.
MARY PATRICK: Mary Clarence, could you? Mary Lazarus, you're terrific, but... Could you help us?
