MILES: That was big of him.
VICTORIA: Yeah, he's good that way. Very considerate.
MILES: That's great.
VICTORIA: So how're you doing?
MILES: Since the last time we spoke? I don't know. Could be better. Could be worse.
VICTORIA: So what's happening with your book?
MILES: Universally rejected. Strike three.
VICTORIA: Oh, Miles. That's awful. What are you going to do?
MILES: Back to the drawing board, I guess. Or not. So... you're married. Congratulations. You look happy.
VICTORIA: I am.
MILES: Seems like everyone's getting married. A year ago it was all divorces. Now it's all weddings. Cyclical, I guess.
VICTORIA: I guess.
MILES: Well, let's go have some champagne, shall we? Toast all the newlyweds.
VICTORIA: Not me. I'm not drinking.
MILES: You quit drinking?
VICTORIA: I'm pregnant.
MILES: Oh. Huh. Well... Congratulations again, Vicki. That's wonderful news.
VICTORIA: See you over there, Miles.
MILES: Yeah.
