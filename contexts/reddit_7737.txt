What full time job can I take? (incoming part time MBA student)
Hey guys. Going to University of San Francisco for my MBA this 2019. Was wondering what jobs I can take as a part time MBA student. I'm an international student from the Philippines though so I was hoping to get a full time job to support my expenses while I study. I got 5 years experience in marketing and product management. Any suggestions?

Edit: I'm a US citizen so I can work more than 20 hours.

Thanks.
