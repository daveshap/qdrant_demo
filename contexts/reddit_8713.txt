Who is the rightful president of Venezuela, on what grounds, and how can it be interpreted so differently by different countries and institutions?
Nicolas Maduro [won](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/21/venezuela-elections-nicolas-maduro-wins-second-term) the presidential election in Venezuela, but his victory is [disputed](https://www.npr.org/2013/04/16/177427309/venezuelas-presidential-election-remains-disputed) by the opposition. Not long after, the European Union [backed](https://amp.dw.com/en/venezuela-eu-backs-juan-guaido-as-national-assembly-head/a-53689379) Juan Guaido, head of the opposition-majority in the National Assembly. He then went ahead to call himself the president of Venezuela, yet the Venezuelan Supreme Court [claimed](https://en.mercopress.com/2020/06/05/eu-ratifies-that-juan-guaido-is-the-legitimate-congressional-president-in-venezuela) Maduro was still the rightful president. It has even went so far that a British court has ruled that Venezuela’s gold reserves [belong](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-gold-britain/britain-recognizes-guaido-as-venezuelas-president-in-gold-dispute-judge-rules-idUSKBN2431CG) to Guaido’s administration rather than to Maduro’s.

But who is right and why? What political mechanisms speak for or against Maduro and Guaido? Who is the legitimate president from a constitutional perspective?
