I feel like I’m trying to force a relationship into my life
For the past 3 years I’ve been trying to get a girlfriend by going out clubbing, going on dating apps, approaching girls — but nothing’s worked. I feel like I’m trying too hard. 

Maybe I should just focus on self improvement and join new clubs for the sake of having fun and maybe then I will get a girlfriend, when I’m least expecting it
