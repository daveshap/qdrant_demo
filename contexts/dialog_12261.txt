HEATHER CHANDLER: Veronica. Finally. Got a paper of Kurt Kelly's. I need you to forge a hot and horny but realistically low-key note in Kurt's handwriting and we'll slip it into Martha Dumptruck's lunch tray.
VERONICA: Shit, Heather. I don't have anything against Martha Dunnstock.
HEATHER CHANDLER: You don't have anything <u>for</u> her either. Come on, it'll be Very. The note'll give her shower nozzle masturbation material for weeks.
VERONICA: I'll think about it.
HEATHER CHANDLER: Don't think.
