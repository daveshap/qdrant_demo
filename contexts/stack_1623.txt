Can I derive steering wheel angle of a car from gyroscope data (x,y,z values)? I am not an electrical engineer but I don't really know where to ask this question so here it is. I have some x,y,z gyroscope data from a car and I want to calculate the steering wheel angle at a point in time. Is that possible and how can I do it?EDITData comes from a smart phone mounted inside the car.The thing is that I don't really need to be precise. I just need some way of calculating the steering wheel angle (or the torque if the former is not an option). I want to then use this data for training and evaluating an algorithm, so it doesn;t matter if the steering wheel angles really match the real world that good, at the end of the day I only care about my algorithm being able to predict values close to those used for its training.
