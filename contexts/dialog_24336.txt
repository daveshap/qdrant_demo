APRIL: Jesus, what happened to you?
PAUL: It looks worse than it is. I'm okay.
APRIL: What happened?
PAUL: I'll tell you all about it... ... but not here.
APRIL: It's been a while. I thought maybe you'd be in touch.
PAUL: Yeah, well, I've sort of been out of commission. How's Melville?
APRIL: Almost done. A week or ten days, and I'll be there.
