GUILT TRIPPING IS NOT OK
I've been told all my life "Don't kill yourself you will hurt everyone else" " It's selfish" "Think about the people who have no choice" I fucking know that!!

 You don't think I know that I'm going to make people sad and hurt? Do you even care what I might be going through? 

DON'T TELL PEOPLE THAT IT'S SELFISH. THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING SO HARD. THEY JUST WANT THE PAIN TO END. 

That's all I want. It hurts too much. Stop telling me what I already know. I don't want to hurt anyone but I can't keep doing this shit
