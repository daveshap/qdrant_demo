Be the coolest (the calmest)
Be the coolest (the calmest) person in your family is a sort of a superpower. 
If you live in a family like mine, where you’re the “logician”, and you think you’ve reached a certain point of patience, the highest amongst buddhist monks 😅, than YOU HAVE TO KNOW: YOU ARE THE JOLLY CARD OF YOUR OWN FAMILY. 
So continue to be kind, use your logic, your intelligence, and your calm to stay cool and make cool situations when it occurs, use any and or every tool you have to make this happen. You need it. Your family needs it. 
They have not a rulebook, nor the perfect guide to live the “normal” life, nor they can teach it to you. So be inclusive with them, and to survive, just remember how important is to recognize the parents leadership as a SON! This is very important. 
It’s 10:48 am (CEST) right now,  and there’s a situation really... “interesting” today, nonetheless we’ve got guests tonight, so I have to be cool and make others be cool. 
Seems like I’ve got a Mission Impossible today: LET’S GET IT STARTED! 😎
