COMMENTATOR #1: Without a doubt this is the most punishing brawl I have ever seen -- The ringside audience is spotted with blood. This fight should have been stopped rounds ago but Rocky Balboa refuses to fall --
COMMENTATOR #2: Not only has he refused to fall, but he has beaten the Champion's body without mercy and the bout has become a vicious slugfest.
APOLLO: My side.
TRAINER: Get that doctor.
APOLLO: No doctor!
TRAINER: You're hurtin', man!
APOLLO: No doctor!... I'm feelin' good, bro!
MICKEY: Wanna keep goin'?
ROCKY: Would you keep goin'?
MICKEY: ...Yeah.
MIKE: No more, ya wanna lose an eye? No more.
ROCKY: Open my eyes -- Please, open my eyes!
