NURSE: No one's really said four months is all you have, have they?
GEORGE: Stage four pancreatic cancer. They haven't even pretended to offer treatment. You tell me, when would you start eating red meat?
NURSE: Can you build a house in four months?
GEORGE: I can die trying.
NURSE: Good for you.
GEORGE: I haven't been touched in years.
NURSE: I'm sorry, I don't know what that was.
GEORGE: A handshake, or you know, someone pats you on your back through clothes. Doctors, people who have to touch you. But not by people who want to.
NURSE: No. A friend... your mother? Everybody gets touched by someone they love.
GEORGE: Isn't that weird? I mean, I dated a little bit after my divorce, for four or five years. Six years. I know when my son was younger...maybe when he was ten or eleven even, he'd run up and wrap his arms around me.
