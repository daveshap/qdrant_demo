SALINAS: Speck's the killer all right. We got box loads of evidence. Did 'em all the same way: torture, strangulation. Prostitutes. I don't think we'll be able to write off any outstandings on him -- this is probably the full body count.
KOESSLER: What about his killer?
SALINAS: Nada. Vague description, that's all. Fine-tooth-combed Speck's car, the diner: no fingerprints, no trace evidence.
KOESSLER: What's with the eyelids?
EAGLEFOOT: Ripped off. By hand, my guess. Perimortal: victim was alive at the time, there's blood on his throat.
SALINAS: That's the thing. Don't know if it connects, but Harold here had a thing about eyes. Two of the victims had their eyes gouged out, another punctured. Took polaroids after.
KOESSLER: You have the photo from the diner?
SALINAS: At the field office.
KOESSLER: Let's take a look at it. Drop off my stuff at the hotel after you're done here.
KULOK: Thanks for the ride.
MACKELWAY: They sort of got me on shit detail, no offense.
KULOK: None taken.
MACKELWAY: Maybe I shouldn't put it that way. I'm on my best behavior. I've got to watch what I say.
KULOK: You used to be in the Behavioral Science Unit, right?
MACKELWAY: The Academy, then CIIAC.
KULOK: I read your white paper. It's sort of like the Bible for what they're trying to do in Computer Crime.
MACKELWAY: How long have you been downtown?
KULOK: Five months. I love it.
MACKELWAY: You work with Koessler?
KULOK: Not especially.
MACKELWAY: Why did he come out here? What's going on?
KULOK: Beats me. He just asked me to come along, double-check the forensics. What did you do to piss him off?
KULOK: This is a sexy case.
MACKELWAY: Yeah, you know the vic's car, he was killed this side of the state line, the car then pushed across the border. This by an Unknown Subject, presumably the killer, who left no fucking evidence except the snapshot, which may or may not have been accidental.
KULOK: Doesn't fit.
MACKELWAY: This is no random killing, no one shot deal. The UNSUB has killed before; he's good at it. So what do we have? We have someone who has killed before who kills someone who kills: a serial killer of a serial killer -- and who wants the FBI to know he exists.
KULOK: And who kills in the manner of his victim.
MACKELWAY: That information's being withheld from the media.
KULOK: A very sexy case.
