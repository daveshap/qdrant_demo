Can I get my Touch Bar to play sounds to acknowledge my Touch Bar key presses? I love my MBP and the Touch Bar is pretty cool, but sometimes I find I\u2019m second-guessing myself. Did I press the ESC key or not? Did I press that function key? Well you get the idea. There\u2019s just no physical feedback and sometimes I keep tapping where I think something is, but it\u2019s not!I know there's no tactile feedback, but then it hit me - maybe there\u2019s a setting somewhere for sound. You know, like the beeps you here when pressing buttons on some devices.My guess is this is just not possible, but before I make the suggestion to Apple I wanna make sure!Any ideas?
