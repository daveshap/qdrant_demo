If they wanted to, they would
I just wanted to put it out there for everyone and myself who are currently being “ghosted”. There’s a difference between someone being busy and getting ghosted. If the person wanted to text you, they would. If they wanted to call you, they would. People make time for who they want to make time for.. we all have the same 24 hours in a day. I know the phone works both ways and you can reach out to them. But if you find yourself being the one always reaching out take it as a sign and move on. Don’t chase someone that doesn’t want to be chased. There should always be a balance.
