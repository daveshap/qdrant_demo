TED: Elaine.
ELAINE: Ted, please. You're just making things difficult for yourself.
TED: Elaine, what happened to us?
ELAINE: Ted, I loved you and I'll always love you. But I need Simon. He's stable. He's a good provider. I want that at this stage of the game, Ted. He might have his faults, but Simon doesn't know the meaning of the word fear and I need that in a man.
