Seriously put SOMETHING in your description on dating apps!
Just your face is not enough. Does that face have a brain? Why not put a single sentence in your profile? Does it really work for you to leave it blank? I can’t help but assume you’re the most self-obsessed person ever.

How am I supposed to broach a conversation from nothing?

It’s an automatic swipe left from me if I see a blank profile no matter how “hot” you think you are.
