Is it possible to enforce mental and physical health thresholds for a President?
There has been a lot of speculation about [Trump's mental health](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/brainstorm/201701/shrinks-battle-over-diagnosing-donald-trump). I can't imagine anyone could diagnose a person without an actual examination, so I take these reports with a huge grain of salt. The health of candidates was an issue even during the primaries leading up to the election. There was a lot of debate when [Hillary Clinton fainted](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/hillary-clinton-collapse-faint-video-9-11-memorial-democrat-ill-overheated-latest-a7237276.html). Everyone's health is private and a leader's health issues must be a secret so that adversarial powers don't get an advantage.

But at the same time, since many candidates are past their middle age by the time they get to the Presidency ([average age is 55 as per Wikipedia] (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Presidents_of_the_United_States_by_age))  how should the citizens be assured that their leader is in the best physical and mental state to handle the enormous responsibilities that come with the position?
