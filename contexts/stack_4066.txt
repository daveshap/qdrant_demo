Can I apply for a F1 Visa while in the U.S. on a Visa Waiver (VWP ESTA) (NO Status change in the U.S.)? I am planning on visiting my friend in the United States in May and June on a ESTA. I will study in the U.S. in August with a F-1 visa. I was wondering if anyone knows if I can APPLY for the F-1 Visa in the United States? I don't need to change my status while on the ESTA. I will return to Germany and re-enter later.I am just worried that July is not enough time to get my VISA in Germany for August and trying to figure out if I need to cancel my plans! I would love to hear someone's experience!
