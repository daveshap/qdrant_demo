Can MQ-135 Gas Sensor be used to make DIY CO2 level monitor? So I am thinking of building an device to measure CO2 levels in the air DIY fashion as premade equipment costs upwards of 100$.I have found some information on how to build such a device using Arduino and a MQ-135 Gas Sensor. Seeing how the MQ-135 sensor is about 5 bucks I was wondering if it would be able to actually measure CO2 parts in the air, as other CO2 specific sensors I have found are more in the hundreds of dollars price range.Has the MQ-135 Gas Sensor already been used for projects like this?
