MADELEINE: They've taken your clothes?
THE MARQUIS: They decreed me a savage, and now they have made me one.
THE MARQUIS: Surely you've seen a man naked.
MADELEINE: It's only been described to me. In your books.
MADELEINE: I must say, in your novels you stoke the most unrealistic expectations.
THE MARQUIS: You're far crueler than I, my sweet.
MADELEINE: The Abbe's sending me away. He fears for me here, what with the likes of you --
THE MARQUIS: Don't be fooled, Madeleine! He fears for himself. He's like a man starving, and you -- ha! -- you're like a pork chop dolloped with heavy cream --
MADELEINE: He's a man of God; he's true to his vows.
THE MARQUIS: First and foremost, he's a MAN. You remind him of that fact, and he resents you for it.
