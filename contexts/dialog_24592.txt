JOE: What's the matter, Sugar?
SUGAR: I don't know. All of a sudden, I'm thirsty.
JERRY: How did you get that bracelet?
SUGAR: You like it?
JERRY: I always did.
SUGAR: Junior gave it to me. It must have at least thirty stones -
JERRY: Thirty-four.
SUGAR: He's going to South America to marry some other girl - that's what they call high finance.
JERRY: That's what I call a louse! If I were you, Sugar, I'd throw that bracelet right back in his face.
JOE: Daphne -
SUGAR: He was the first nice guy I ever met in my life - and the only one who ever gave me anything.
JOE: You'll forget him, Sugar.
SUGAR: How can I? No matter where I go, there'll always be a Shell station on the corner. I'll bring this back when it's empty.
JERRY: You crazy or something? The place is crawling with mobsters - gangrene is setting in - and you're making like Diamond Jim Brady! How are we going to get out of here? How are we going to eat?
JOE: We'll walk. And if we have to, we'll starve.
JERRY: There you go with that we again.
