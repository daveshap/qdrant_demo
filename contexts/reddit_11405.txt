My mother seems to care more about interior decor than my father's threats to disown me
About 1.5 years ago, I broke up with someone out of fear of parental retribution. Afterwards, when I specifically asked about it, my dad confirmed that yes, I would be disowned if I got involved with anyone who was at all black. My mother was silent then, and every other time this argument has come up. She *says* she doesn't want to disown me, that she will not cut contact, but that it's not worth fighting with my father over. 

But, she chooses to fight my father over all sorts of stuff. She says more words about my father leaving a vacuum cleaner out or the fact that he had to pull things out to go through and organize them and decide what to throw away. The two of them argued for nearly two years on the color of a toilet. 

I just don't understand how someone can derive so much their self worth from the color of a toilet in a house they don't even live in and so little from the family's relationship with their son. Why is she willing to break down in tears over granite counter-tops, but not even say a word when my father threatens to cut contact?
