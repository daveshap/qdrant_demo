SHELLY: Hey, I thought I recognized you two, hi Vada.
VADA: Hi.
HARRY: I'm just picking some things up for the barbecue.
SHELLY: Yeah, me too, mind if I tag along?
HARRY: Not at all. Lot of potatoes!
SHELLY: It's for Shelly's famous potato salad.
HARRY: I'm looking forward to that.
HARRY: HEY, OUCH, damn it!! Vada, watch what you're doing.
VADA: Sorry.
SHELLY: You know this is gonna be my first 4th of July picnic in a long time.
HARRY: Really?
VADA: Dad, didn't you say you needed prunes REAL bad?
HARRY: Ahh, Vada, just put anything you want in the cart, anything at all. I don't know what's gotten into her today.
