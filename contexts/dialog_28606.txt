RESTON: Kenny! What happened? They didn't let me up front, said the President was on the phone the whole time.
KENNY: He was.
RESTON: Yeah? Who was he talking to? Acheson? Come on, O'Donnell, everyone's wondering what's going on. What's Acheson doing in town? And don't give me some bullshit about DNC think tanks. Acheson's Mr. Cold War.
KENNY: Why don't you ask him yourself? You can have him on the way home.
RESTON: I'm giving you a chance here: talk to me. You can influence how this thing unfolds.
THE PRESIDENT: Let's get out of here.
KENNY: Cheer up, you've neutralized the entire White House Press Corps for a day.
