I feel traumatized after my "first" job after college
Okay, I graduated in 2018 so this happened nearly two years ago but it's something that has stayed with me since, and I don't know how to seek past it. First off, I'm sorry if this isn't the place for this, if anyone could direct me to where this would be more appropriate, please do so!

In 2018, I graduated with a degree in supply chain, job search was extremely hard but somehow I landed an inventory planner role at a small-mid food/trading company. Now this job was a disaster for me. There wasn't any kind of onboarding that allowed me to be acquainted with the operations of the company, I was given so much information and responsibilities that I could not retain everything, and it seemed like I was asking very stupid questions. My excel skills was very subpar at the time too, I never learned more beyond the excel I used at school. I had to google to learn how to do things on Excel on the job and the manager was very frustrated at me and he told me point blank that "I thought you graduated from a good business school, what happened? Did you lie about your credentials?" I was flabbergasted. He handed me a supply chain for dummies book and told me to study it, and it hurt my self worth a lot. I WAS passionate about supply chain and still retained a lot of things I learned at school, however I thought it was okay to not remember/know everything and that you would learn on the job?

Anyway, after a week, I knew that place couldn't be for me and we mutually decided to part ways as I knew he'd let me go sooner or less. Job search after that became even harder than it was before, I felt worthless and unconfident to start a career in supply chain, I went on so many interviews and failed to secure a position in the field. I am now working in an unrelated career path. It's a humble career, but I feel like I could do more with myself and get paid a lot more, especially since I have a double major in supply chain and information systems. But the thing is, that "first" job greatly traumatizes me to this day and I feel like I could never be good to work in an analyst or planner role within supply chain. COVID 19 has really set me back this year as well, I wanted it to be the year where I'd leave my current job and seek a job in supply chain, but right now I care a lot about job security. I don't want to land a job in supply chain and have it end up like my first job, with me having to leave or be let go because I am unqualified.

Did anyone ever have this problem or feeling when you had you first job after college, where you wholly unprepared and unqualified?

EDIT: First off -- wow, thank you everyone for your incredible support. I wrote this post not knowing I'd get this many responses. It's hard for me to formulate my thoughts and reply to each post, but I have read all of your responses and will take your advice to heart. I'm glad to know that I wasn't the only one going through this (I actually shouldn't say glad, it's sad that it's happened to so many people as well). It really just seems like I was very unlucky in my first job and what happened was not at all my fault. I just need to muster up the courage to start applying everywhere again and realize that any good company will have proper onboarding process and will offer me the support I need to adjust and fit well in the company.
