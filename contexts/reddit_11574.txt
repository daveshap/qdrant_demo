Cut contract with my abusive family. Don’t have any friends. My partner is withdrawn lately and I don’t know why. I feel completely alone.
I don’t know what to do at this point. My partner lost their job a few weeks ago, and has been incredibly depressed. But they’ve been getting more withdrawn lately and have been toxic to me today. I want to hurt about my family, even though they were driving me to panic attacks every time we spoke. The dislike of them for all the bad things is mixed in with the pain of losing people I’ve known for 26 years. Hearing coworker’s fond memories of holiday gatherings is making it even harder, despite the fact that I never had one even with them around. But I don’t feel like I can bring this up to my partner when they won’t speak more than 5 words to me. 

And I don’t have anybody else. I don’t know what to do.
