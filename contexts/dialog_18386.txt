JEFFERSON: Gee, I'm sorry. You see, it wasn't until I was fairly well along in the bus that I realized--
SAUNDERS: Did you say--bus?
JEFFERSON: One of those sightseers--you know. You see, I--gosh, I've never been called absent-minded or... but there it was all of a sudden--looking right at me through one of the station doors--
SAUNDERS: There *what* was?
JEFFERSON: The Dome--the Capitol Dome--
JEFFERSON: --big as life--sparkling away there under the sun. I--I started walking toward it--and there was a bus outside-- and--well--I--I just naturally got aboard--
SAUNDERS: Most natural thing in the world!
JEFFERSON: I don't believe I've been so thrilled in my--oh, and that Lincoln Memorial! Gee! There he is--Mr. Lincoln--looking right at you as you come up the steps-- sitting there like he was waiting for someone to come along--
SAUNDERS: Well--he's got nothing on me.
SAUNDERS: Now, if you're ready, Senator, we can start for the hotel. I'll *see* that you get there.
JEFFERSON: Yes--I think maybe you'd better.
JEFFERSON: Whose statue is that?
SAUNDERS: I wouldn't know in the *day time*.
JEFFERSON: The Capitol Dome! Lighted up!
SAUNDERS: You--uh--you better relax, Senator. You'll be plumb wore out.
JEFFERSON: Tell me, Miss Saunders--what time does the Senate--uh--what do they call it?
SAUNDERS: Convene?
JEFFERSON: Convene--that's it--yes. I got to pick up some of those parliamentary words. I imagine a fellow can get pretty lost in the Senate without 'em--
SAUNDERS: With or without 'em. Twelve--noon. The Senate convenes at twelve o'clock.
JEFFERSON: Gosh--that'll be something! You know what I better do in the morning?
SAUNDERS: No. What had you better--?
JEFFERSON: Go out to Mount Vernon. It'd be a sort of fine thing to do--see Washington's home just before walking into the Senate for the first time-- don't you think?
SAUNDERS: Oh--a wonderful thing--yes. Get you right in the mood--yes--yes.
