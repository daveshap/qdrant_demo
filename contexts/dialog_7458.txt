OLD FARMHAND'S VOICE: Hey there, Dan'l! Black Dan'l!
WEBSTER: Hullooo!
OLD FARMHAND'S VOICE: Someone to see you, Dan'l!
WEBSTER: If it's the British Minister, take him around to the pantry and give him some Madeira --
OLD FARMHAND'S VOICE: Just someone from New Hampshire!
WEBSTER: Why, that's different! Well, boys, I guess we'll knock off. I've got to see a friend.
WEBSTER: Well Mary, it's too bad I didn't know -- I would have given you a real dinner, but with my wife being in Washington -- Have another piece of pie --
MARY: No, really, thank you. -- Is Mrs. Webster coming back soon?
WEBSTER: Well -- she hardly ever comes here -- she's not the type of woman who cares to live in the country. Yes -- I'm all on my own -- sometimes it makes you feel a little lonely -- Do you mind if I indulge?
MARY: Of course not --
WEBSTER: No, you wouldn't -- You're not the sort of woman that's afraid of smoke -- or fire -- But now let's talk about your affairs.
MARY: Goodness, Mr. Webster, I've done nothing but talk about that all through dinner.
WEBSTER: Yes, you've chatted a lot, woman-like nibbling around the edge -- But, Mary, forgive an old lawyer's legal mind, I don't think you ever once came to the point. And there is a point, isn't there?
MARY: Why -- yes -- it's hard to put it into words, Mr. Webster. There's this matter of little Daniel's schooling and the new house -- and well -- there's something else that's wrong -- it gets worse, year after year -- it's like a shadow growing -- I can't really talk about it, even to Ma -- she puts it all on Jabez and I won't stand for that.
WEBSTER: I've heard some odd things about Jabez lately -- he seems to make the wrong kind of name for himself.
MARY: Mr. Webster, you mustn't believe all that people say.
WEBSTER: You don't have to defend him to me, Mary -- I've been called names myself.
MARY: You see, I don't care if we are rich or poor -- I don't care if we're big or small, all I care about is Jabez. He was the first man I loved. He never used to care about money -- we were poor as Job's turkey, but none of us minded. Now I've seen him drive the poor from the door, and we used to be poor ourselves. I've seen him get hard and mean, and he isn't hard or mean. I've heard him mock at the church bells -- the bells that rang for our wedding. That's not like him, Mr. Webster -- It must be my fault somehow -- my fault.
WEBSTER: Mary -- you've talked to me as you might have talked to your father and I believe he wants me to help you a little. You see, sometimes we think we're licked in this life -- but we weren't put here to be licked. Don't you believe it. Sometimes the shadows seem to get hold of us -- the shadows and the evil -- but it is still up to us to fight. Now I was thinking before you came, of coming over to Cross Corners end of the month, to get acquainted with my Godson -- and other things.
MARY: Oh, could you, Mr. Webster ?
WEBSTER: And now come on, Mary. I want to show you the all-fired biggest parsnips in the whole United States, raised right here in Marshfield -- of course!
