MARIE: Are you okay?
ROB: Yes. You?
MARIE: For now. But I wouldn't be if I thought this was the end of the evening.
ROB: I'm sure it isn't.
MARIE: Good. In that case, I'll fix us something else to drink. You sticking to the whiskey or you want coffee?
ROB: Whiskey.
MARIE: Tops off two whiskeys and starts into the other room where she sees Rob, standing and holding his jacket.
ROB: I'd better go. I gotta get up early. Go over to my parents'.
MARIE: When I said before that I hoped it wasn't the end of the evening, I was, you know... talking about breakfast and stuff.
MARIE: I'd like it if you could stay the night.
ROB: Oh, right. Alright.
MARIE: Jesus, so much for delicacy. I pegged you for a master of understatement, beating around the bush and all that buzz.
ROB: I use it but I don't understand it when other people use it.
MARIE: So you'll stay?
ROB: Yeah.
MARIE: Good.
