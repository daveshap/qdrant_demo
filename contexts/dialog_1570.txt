VLADIMIR: Are you impressed with our Anastasia?
SOPHIE: Oh, heavens - I must say, yes.
VLADIMIR: Then, you'll take her to see Tatiana?
SOPHIE: Oh, heavens I must say... no, no actually, I can't - Tatiana has refused to see any more girls.
VLADIMIR: Perhaps you could convince her?
SOPHIE: Oh, heavens, no... but ... She is going to be at the Ballet Russe tonight! That's the Russian Ballet - Russe for Russian, oh those crazy French... they only go to see which dancers will defect.
