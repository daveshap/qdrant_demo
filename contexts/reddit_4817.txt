I am broken and have never been this low before. I thought I was hurt after my dad died but losing a person you thought you’d spend your whole life with is next level. I just need someone to talk to.
It’s weird how one day you’re talking about marriage and a family and the next the person is gone. I just need someone to talk to so I can know if I’ve truly given my all to this situation or if I can do more. The hardest part is accepting what you can and can’t change
