SUPERGIRL: What is this place?
ZALTAR: This is the Phantom Zone. But why did you come here from Argo City?
SUPERGIRL: I was on Earth...
ZALTAR: Earth? You crossed the dimension barrier? By yourself?
SUPERGIRL: Yes. I went there to find the lost Power Source...
ZALTAR: Shouldnt've done that.
SUPERGIRL: ...but the person who has it. tricked me, and sent me to the Phantom Zone.
ZALTAR: It's dangerous to use a Power Source on Earth. It can unleash all sorts of terrible forces---
SUPERGIRL: I know.
ZALTAR: Well, nothing we can do about it. Come into my house. You can stay with me, until I build you your own place. I expect you won't want to mix with the others-- not our type of people.
SUPERGIRL: Others?
