MELVIN: What's this?
CAROL: A thank-you note for what you did for me.
FRANK: She's nice.
MELVIN: Really nice. Shouldn't that be a good thing... telling someone, 'no thanks required.'
FRANK: It looks like it really went over. You're sure making the rounds. Simon says you brought him soup last night. I hope he doesn't write you a note.
FRANK: What?
MELVIN: What?" Look at you... You sense a mark."
FRANK: Hey -- you called me... I...
MELVIN: About a dog.
FRANK: Yeah, but it's all about Simon now... you helped with the dog... And now there are other things. I'm just as concerned as you are about Simon.
MELVIN: Concerned. I'm just the hall monitor here.
FRANK: It's not only financial assistance. What he's got to do is go to Baltimore tomorrow and ask his parents for money. It's not going to happen on the phone.
MELVIN: Yeah. If his parents are alive they've got to help -- those are the rules. Good.
FRANK: Yes. And tomorrow? I have a high maintenance selling painter coming through... So I'm out. Can you take him?
MELVIN: Think white and get serious.
FRANK: Take my car -- a convertible. Do you drive?
MELVIN: Like the wind but I'm not doing it.
CAROL: Getting loud, getting loud.
MELVIN: He wants me to take his car and his client to Baltimore.
CAROL: I want your life for a minute where my big problem is someone offers me a free convertible so I can get out of this city.
