RUDY: Tell me something. This the first time you've ever done this?
ASHLEY: Go to hell, Nick Mason, what's that supposed to mean --
RUDY: No, not that, no... I mean this, the whole thing. Start writing to a guy, guy in the bricks. Get a boyfriend like this. Tell me the truth.
ASHLEY: Well. You're not the first guy I wrote to. But you're the only one I kept writing to.
RUDY: Yeah. Me too. Why? I mean I know why for me, why I paid for the ad. But you... why start writing to some guy -- some con -- you don't even know?
ASHLEY: I told you, Nick. Remember?
RUDY: Tell me again.
ASHLEY: All the guys I've ever been with... they never want to know me. Who I am on the inside. They just want to qet inside. When they do, they think that means they know who I am. That I trust them. That they know me. That there's nothing left to learn. A guy like you, Nick -- six months before you can even touch my face. I figure a guy in that kind of bind, he's gonna hafta work to get to know me some other way.
RUDY: Had some bad relationships, didn't you.
ASHLEY: Not bad. Just regular. You wrote me wonderful things, Nick. Personal things.
RUDY: Well, wasn't all me, y'know.
ASHLEY: Yes it was all you --
RUDY: Guy I was in with... he helped sometimes... some of the romantic stuff, actually... you'd like him --
ASHLEY: I'm talking about the heart, Nick. I'm not talking about the words.
RUDY: Y'know, some of the heart mighta been his too...
ASHLEY: Then he shoulda signed his name.
