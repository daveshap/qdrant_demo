COCO: Your Aunt called me.
BETTY: I was afraid of that.
COCO: She wants to know who's staying in her apartment.
BETTY: It's just for a night or two, until she finds her own place. I tried to explain that to Aunt Ruth, but the connection was bad and her plane was leaving and she got it all mixed up. I kept telling her it was my friend and she kept saying she didn't know any Ritas ...
COCO: Sweetie, look at me straight.
BETTY: Coco...she's very nice. We went to school together.
COCO: So I guess your Grandpa and Grandma know her.
BETTY: Not really. I met her in junior college and she was from this other town.
