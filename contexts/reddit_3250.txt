Is it just me or was this interview really odd?
A bit of background, my career so far has been working with homeless & vulnerable people, doing advocacy, helping people access housing, deal with housing law etc etc. I’ve had a few roles in this field and so am used to interviews in this line of work, however -

I had interview today that was just... odd. First off, I arrived early, they arrived 15 mins late without any apology. The manager interviewing me was **extremely awkward, wouldn’t make eye contact and kept shuffling around in his chair. At first I thought he was just shy, but as the interview went on they just went rapid fire through the questions, either cutting me off mid sentence or leaving long awkward pauses that I felt like I had to try and fill. 

I wasn’t asked anything about myself, just very dry and corporate sounding questions, which is really odd for a support role.  

When I asked questions at the end about supporting clients, the manager actually said “they’re only supposed to stay for 2 years but we’ve had some people for 10 or 11. You can’t exactly empower people with mental health problems, know what I mean? They can’t do shit for themselves”. I was gobsmacked - I didn’t know whether he was trying to catch me out or if this was some weird interview technique or what, but I was so appalled I was shocked into silence. 

Then at the end they basically said “you’ll get an email to let you you’ve been unsuccessful”.

Anyone else had any weird interviews like this?! Should I feed back to the company? I could be being too sensitive but felt like it was really unprofessional.
