ADAM: Indivisible and inseparable.
KITTLE: Incestuous.
ADAM: Every person's got their own kinks, beef-cake. What's wrong, Kittle? You don't swing?
ADAM: What Eve and I wouldn't give to meet up with you on the business end of a daisy chain.
KITTLE: Put up your kickstand, freak. Start talking, or we're out the door.
ADAM: A little birdie whispered in my ear today... about the needle-candy you're chasing. It's up here... ... in the old curiosity shop.
KITTLE: How much?
ADAM: I figure, for this information, the usual payment... times ten.
KITTLE: You think it's that good?
ADAM: I'll tell you what... I think it's all you've got.
KITTLE: Well... what can I do? You've created a dilemma... And, look at the that. Time's running out. I wonder... how can I impress upon you just exactly how frustrating this situation is for me?
