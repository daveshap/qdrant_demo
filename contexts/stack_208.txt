My keyboard on MacBook got stuck - do Apple Stores fix it without Apple Care? The delete key on my MacBook (mid-2017 12' model) seems to have got stuck and often it won't respond to my pushing on the key. So I temporarily swapped the delete key for the backslash but I rather want to fix it. But I find it is incredibly hard to fix it on my own, so I consider bringing it to the Apple Store.But my MacBook is neither covered by the Apple Care program nor was purchased in a country where I'm in now. Is it possible to fix it up at the Apple Store and does the fix of the stuck keyboard get me charged (if so, approximately how much)?
