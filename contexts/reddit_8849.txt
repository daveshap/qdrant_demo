The actual state of the International healthcare market
It is [often](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/articles/2016-08-03/canadians-increasingly-come-to-us-for-health-care) suggested that a [healthcare](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/yp3qy5/fact-checking-trump-are-canadians-swarming-the-border-to-get-better-healthcare) migrant [market](http://caffertyfile.blogs.cnn.com/2009/08/21/canadians-crossing-the-border-for-u-s-health-care/) exists internationally, that people come from Europe, Canada, and Mexico to receive superior/faster healthcare in the US. 

Similarly, an international [prescription](https://www.cnbc.com/2014/05/23/patients-cross-borders-for-online-deals-on-medications.html) market exists where US residents often buy prescriptions, especially from Canada and Mexico. 

Is there data to show the extent of this market? Or are we doomed to anecdotes from both sides?
