How do you get past the job app screenings?!
A bit of a rant mix with a question.

I've been working on a job application for a finance position that required "Some College" experience at a university.  I'm a current grad student (4.0 GPA) there and this particular position was inside my school so I was pretty excited for the opportunity and put a few hours and had several consultations with our career planning department before I submitted an official application.  I finish the process Saturday morning and at 8:30 Monday morning I got a general rejection letter.  I'm assuming that no one stayed over the weekend to go through applications so I know it has to do with the screening process.

I included a large chunk of their job description descriptors and included my past 5-6 years of experience in the finance department at my current job.  I was told to include that I was a current grad student because they love hiring students but after all of this I still couldn't get past the screening.  I'm somewhat devastated.  I couldn't pass a simple computer screening even with all of this consultations and hours of work in perfecting my resume and cover letter.

How do you get a foot in the door?  I just don't understand the formula to beat the screening and have an actual set of human eyes go over my resume.
