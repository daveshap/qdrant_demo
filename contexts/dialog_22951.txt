FATHER MCFEELY: Uh... I'm Father McFeely
MOTHER: Father, come in, please.
MOTHER: I'm so glad you're here.
FATHER MCFEELY: I came as fast as I could, but at my age the little soldier needs a lot more thumpin before it starts pumpin. If I tickle my ass before...
MOTHER: It's okay. I understand.
FATHER MCFEELY: How is she?
MOTHER: She's gotten worse, Father. She won't eat, she won't talk. The child won't even let me touch her.
FATHER MCFEELY: Yes... Sometimes you have to give them candy.
HARRIS: Father.
FATHER MCFEELY: Not unless you have a paternity test to prove it.
