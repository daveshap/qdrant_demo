SAUNDRA: How do we get out of this room ?
BRUCE: We wait. This is an elevator.
MATTHEW: An elevator ?
BRUCE: Yeah, we're about a hundred an fifty feet below the subway stations. We're heading a little higher up now.
SAUNDRA: How's your foot ?
MATTHEW: How's your foot" ? This guy tried to kill us and he put us in this place
BRUCE: It's fine thanks.
MATTHEW: Why don't you tell us a little about yourself ?
BRUCE: Look pipsqueak, I'm having a real bad day here and we're just starting.
SAUNDRA: Now what the hell are we supposed to do ?
BRUCE: We have to climb up that.
MATTHEW: That's not to tough.
BRUCE: Look...
BRUCE: There's enough force to push you twenty feet in the air. It won't kill you, but it will hurt.
SAUNDRA: You have issues. I mean you have some serious issues that need to be ironed out.
MATTHEW: Issues ??? This guy has the damn subscription to every psychotic issue I've ever heard of.
BRUCE: That's cute asshole.
