Got a "are you still interested in this position?" email from recruiter 3 weeks after on-site interview. What does this mean?
Went through rounds of interview with the company 3 weeks ago. I followed up twice afterward with the recruiter for updates, but didn't get any reply. Today, the recruiter replied with a message "sorry for the delay. Are you still interested in this position?"

Has anyone countered this situation before?
