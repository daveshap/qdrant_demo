I ate healthy stuff!
Okay so this is going to sound ridicolous, but I'm really bummed about exams and university and the past month has been hell and I might drop out or just miss a semester or two. And I need to acknowledge this.

I have issues with comfort eating, and since I've stopped taking dance classes and everything basically I'm a bit over normal weight now. But weight is not really the issue; usually I can't be bothered to make an effort for my food. I eat way too many meals that just look like: bread, butter, cheese, mayo. (Yeah, mayo, I know.....) I just can't be bothered. But anyway I just watched *The Terror* yesterday, and now there's this little voice in my head all day that keeps going "FRUITS VEGETABLES FRUITS VEGETABLES FRUITS VEGETABLES" lol. And I ate an apple yesterday, and put lemon juice in my tea, and I just made myself a freaking salad. And I'm...proud, even if it's not much.
