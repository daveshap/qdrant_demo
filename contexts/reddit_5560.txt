Accounting at John Deere
 So, I received a recruiting email today from a contactor for John Deere about an accountant position. I don't really have a lot of accounting experience, so I'm not really sure why they're interested in me. I just got done with college and have never had an accounting position and it was not one of my majors.

Regardless, is there anyone who has worked for Deere as an accountant, or might have insight into what a job with them might be like? I don't honestly know a whole lot about accounting except what I learned in my one accounting class for my business degree.

I have a call tomorrow with the recruiter and I am not entirely sure what to expect or what I should say.

Any advice or info would be greatly appreciated!
