MELANIE: Finn, there's a splinter in your left foot. If you don't let me take the splinter out, it will fester.
FINN: Go away.
MELANIE: What did I do wrong?
FINN: I won't do it because he wants me to do it, even if I want to do it.
MELANIE: Do what? Oh, I see.
FINN: You're only a young thing.
MELANIE: You're not so old yourself!
FINN: Living with him put years on me.
