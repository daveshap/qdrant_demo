BETH: She's really sick you know. Don't you know what she's doing? She knows I went to Berkeley. She knows I knew Noah. She makes up that story about me. She's handing you somebody who's obsessed with he her.
NICK: She didn't hand you to me. She doesn't even know who you are. She told me about Lisa Henderson.
BETH: She knew you'd find out who Lisa Henderson is. You're a good cop -- what did she do? Tell you casually and make it seem irrelevant? Did she tell you in bed, Nick? That's how I'd do it.
NICK: Why did you change your name?
BETH: I got married. He was on staff at the clinic. I was down in Salinas. It didn't... last long.
