Is this a midlife crisis or a wake up call?
I’m a 41 year old male who lives about an hour from Perth, Western Australia. I work in advertising sales and have done for most of my working career. Have you ever felt like you have had the same conversation with the same people over and over and over and over? I simply cannot do it anymore...

I have no degree and no real sense of what I want to do with the rest of my life. There is very little unqualified work in and around my home town and I really feel trapped in my current position. It’s becoming very difficult to keep living the same day over and over doing something I despise.

How do I find my passion? How do I change career paths and get qualified? Can anyone help???
