HAN: Yes, Your Highness?
LEIA: You said you were going to stay. What happened?
HAN: That bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind.
LEIA: Does Luke know?
HAN: He'll know when he gets back ... Don't give me that look. Every day more bounty hunters are searching for me. If I don't pay off Jabba soon, there'll be too many to stop ... Remotes, Gank killers, and who knows what else. I've got to get that price off my head while I still have a head.
LEIA: Han, we need you here.
HAN: We?
LEIA: Yes.
HAN: Not you?
LEIA: Me? I don't know what you mean.
HAN: You probably don't. How could you? You're so terrified of your own emotions ...
LEIA: And what are they, pray tell?
HAN: You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me.
LEIA: I respect you. You're a bold fighter, maybe not the brightest, but ... HAN No, your worship.. That's not what I'm talking about.
