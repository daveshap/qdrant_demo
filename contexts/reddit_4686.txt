Feeling down cause I realized I don't know what to do with my life in the long-term
So I was talking with a friend and the topic of what we're interested in and what we want to do in the future was brought up, and I realized that I really don't know what to do with my life. I've been going to the gym, taking watercolor classes, and before the COVID-19 situation, was trying my best at school, but for what? In the end I don't know what I actually want to do with my life, my mind is just an incoherent mess. I feel jealous of him, he's two years younger than me and knows so much about lots of topics, while I just barely grasp the surface of a lot of them; I'm almost 18 and I still feel like a kid who can't even keep herself standing for too long. I've done so much to try to feel happy, fullfil my life, to learn more, but in the end I feel like a fool, a pathetic fool. Sometimes I  don't even feel like not even trying anymore, because it leads me nowhere, I can't progress as much as I fucking want. I'm just feeling really down rn, I was planning to do so much today, but now I don't wanna even move, I feel so useless.
