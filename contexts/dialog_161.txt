ROSE: He said he was her cousin. I told him where she works. They were just here.
EDDIE: Describe him.
ROSE: Tall, short-haired, scary eyes. Second guy with him was...shorter, with a wrestler's build. And he wouldn't turn his videocamera off me.
EDDIE: He had a videocamera? Where is she? Quickly!
ROSE: She washes hair up at Ludwig's - a salon on 63rd and Madison.
EDDIE: Leon - meet us at 63rd and Madison. Hair salon. Ludwig's.
JORDY: I'm on my way with Eddie. Ludwig's. 63rd and Madison. The suspects might be there already.
EDDIE: You thirsty?
JORDY: I'm on duty.
EDDIE: So am I. Alright, I'll go inside and you cover the back.
JORDY: Of course.
EDDIE: Hey! I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid. I dreamed of running up to a door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and yelling 'Freeze!' at the bad guy! What'd you dream about?
JORDY: I wanted to run up to a building on fire, kick in the door, rush into the smoke and save a kid.
EDDIE: Then I guess we're doin' this the right way, aren't we? If we pull up to a burning building I'll gladly let you go first.
