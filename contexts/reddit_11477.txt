Isolated because of autism
My family has all stopped interacting with me since I was diagnosed with autism. My family has big holiday events that I'm not invited to because I'm a "retard". Then they call me up just to tell me how much fun they had. I have been written out of my family's will, everything goes to my step-siblings because they're "more productive" in life.

I have recently become a shut-in because no one wants to even talk to me. I have no friends because either, "You don't look autistic", or "You're just lazy, suck it up."

I have never been hugged, kissed, etc. But I do have a kid because I was taken advantage off during a meltdown. Courts sided with her and that a guy can't be sexually assaulted. I love my son, don't get me wrong. But I have never had a real relationship in my entire life. I have always been used and manipulated most of my life and I feel like giving up.

I'm posting here because I want to feel better about life. I'm to the point I feel like giving up and that it's not worth carrying on anymore. To give reference, I'm almost 50 and I've been dealing with this since I was 8. I just want someone to be my friend in rl.
