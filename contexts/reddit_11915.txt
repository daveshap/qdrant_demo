What's bothering me? I'm lonely and I don't know what to do about it...
To quote Ned Flanders' dad: "We've tried nothing and we're all out of ideas!"

23/M for context.

I'm lonely, I've never had a meaningful relationship, and I don't know what to do about it. I don't know how to approach women. I don't know how to talk to one I'm even remotely interested in. I can't even do online dating because I get so damn nervous and confused I don't know what to do. Going out and trying to dance or talk with women at a bar or show or whatever just gets met with indifference and/or laughs. 

I've tried. I don't know how many different approach techniques or conversation starters or whatever I've found on Reddit and god knows where else but I can't keep my spaghetti in my pockets long enough to get anything accomplished.

I don't know, guys, sorry to just kinda dump this here. I know it's all scattered but it's just been on my head for the last couple of weeks now and I don't have anyone to talk to about it (and that's a different story in and of itself.)
