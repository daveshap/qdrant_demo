Around what year did games go widescreen? I am building a WinXP box to play games I have trouble with on Win10, and I am thinking of placing a 4:3 screen on it, as I didn't think games really supported widescreen until probably well after WinXP was legacy...but I was wondering around what year would I start seeing some or most games going widescreen? Or in another way, when did widescreen monitors become common on new computers?I am not sure if a widescreen monitor would display the 4:3 output in a box (for games that did not scale or stretch to widescreen)...but I think that 4:3 games look much better when framed in a monitor of the same shape.
