ROYER-COLLARD: Good God, Marquise --
RENEE PELAGIE: I'm on the brink of bankruptcy; my husband's resources are all but exhausted. And to what end, I ask you?
ROYER-COLLARD: This is neither the time nor the place --
RENEE PELAGIE: If only you'd remained true to our contract! Opiates, for his nerves! Restraints! The man warrants a bed of nails --
ROYER-COLLARD: I can say, with the utmost sincerity, that every franc you've given me has been put to sterling use.
