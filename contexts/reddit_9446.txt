Paid off all credit card debt for the first time ever!
Today for the first time since I got a credit card 6 years ago, all of my credit card debt has been paid off. After realizing I was paying close to $150 / month in interest I realized I simply could not afford that hidden bill, and made it a goal to make the rest disappear. It took a long time, almost a year. Toward the end the limit on both cards were increased automatically which gave me a lot of temptation to splurge on something, but I was able to maintain my self control and resist.
