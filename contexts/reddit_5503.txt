How to prove for my employeer my knowledge in a tool without previous professional experience?
So im taking some online classes in Excel VBA and other languages but I never needed to use it in my job. I read a lot and people says that this online certificates is not so much worth mention in CVs, so I was thinking .... What about if I create a github account and upload personal projects and use it as a portfolio for my employeers, just like "hm. I know to code in vba, I have a few projects in my portfolio with you want to take a look" or something like that. 

Other way, i dont know how to validate my knowledge without a previus job experience.

Sorry for bad english
