Wouldn't it be wild if
Imagine: 
It's 2019. You're a high school senior applying to colleges. You're 17, maybe 18. You're a kid. Your frontal cortex is underdeveloped. 

You take a Test that measures how well you take tests. You don't like your score, you take it again and again. Finally, you have mastered the skill. This massively sought for, heavily rewarded skill - must be crucial to survival right? You come to find later in life you never used it again. 

You sum up your entire existence into 600 words. You delete a hundred of those words to not make it too tedious to read. 

"Tell us why you dare think you're worthy." You did your best. You wait patiently to see if you were chosen to put yourself in debt and pay thousands of dollars for a stressful experience. 

(I'm just cynical about it today)

Edit: thank you for the silver!
