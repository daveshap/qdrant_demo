My fiancee is a freaking idiot
She made some horrible choices last night and I'm so pissed off at her that I can't even stand it.  I'm half tempted to just start sleeping on the couch till I'm not pissed off anymore.  I could have lost her last night, and I don't know if she truly understands the gravity of the situation.  She's a fucking asshole sometimes, but god I fucking love her.
