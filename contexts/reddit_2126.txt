Please help settle a bet
At some point in December, either out of a desire to distract myself from final exams or merely kill time, I set out with a mission: create the most well-crafted, yet absolutely horrendous, Stanford application essays as I possibly could. In retrospect, my exact reasoning for this decision was hazy, but I did it anyway. What astonished me more though than the fact that I had actually written these essays, however, was that many people, people who I rightfully trust, believed that I had made a mistake in not actually applying with the following essays (in text, and also in the Google Doc). Somehow, they believed, like The Producers, this would be a case of "so bad it's good". Some disclaimers:

\-I did not choose to apply to Stanford, both because there would be far better ways for me to waste money and because I wanted to go to a large public school.

\-Academically and in terms of other attributes, I would have been generally qualified; the following essays would most likely be the topic of differentiation, not necessarily anything else. That is irrelevant in this case, however.

\-I hold no personal grudge toward Stanford for any reason, even if I did not/do not believe it was/is the right fit for me.

The question: Are the following essays so terrible/disdainful/weird/whatever else that they would automatically put me out of contention of being accepted to Stanford? Not that they would get me accepted, but I am personally of the belief that these would be immediately disqualifying, while most have argued the exact opposite. 

Mods, I do apologize if this is too tangential for this subreddit.

The essays:

##### Briefly elaborate on one of your extracurricular activities or work experiences. (150 words)

In the middle of my senior year, I was able to exploit an opportunity given generously by my former Chinese teacher to tutor her academically-challenged son in AP Physics. He was “slow,” according to his mother; I had no hope for him. Still, I knew it was my duty to help the less fortunate, those who were not blessed with my above-average comprehension of the material, and for $35 an hour, who could resist? Henceforth, every day in the library I instilled a basic comprehension of rudimentary physics in that boy; to paraphrase Kipling, I was bound in exile to serve my captive’s need. 

As physics is fundamental to the universe, my actions are thus fundamental as well—those who build houses for the homeless or cure cancer cannot also boast of their dominion over the universe’s natural forces. Henceforth, as I counted my $20 bills, I knew true happiness.

##### What is the most significant challenge that society faces today? (50 word limit)

Despite my exemplary work ethic, self-effacing charm, and jocular wit, I am not appreciated enough by my peers. Shakespeare wrote, “some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them.” If I were to thrust my greatness more vigorously upon society, society would henceforth be improved.

##### How did you spend your last two summers? (50 word limit)

During the summer of junior year, I was able to dispense my wisdom to compatriots at UCSC as a parrot disperses fruit seeds through its feces. Last summer, I studied financial accounting, a decision which inspired me to make money through the profession henceforth. 

##### What historical moment or event do you wish you could have witnessed? (50 word limit)

I wish I witnessed the Deepwater Horizon oil spill; with its boundless expanses of sickly ebon, the cacophonous cawing of drowning seabirds, the palpable fear of a thousand Greenpeace hacks, henceforth I would feel even more appreciation for humanity’s influence on the universe.  

##### What five words best describe you? (10 word limit)

Jaded, idiosyncratic, quixotic, perspicacious, equanimous 

##### When the choice is yours, what do you read, listen to, or watch? (50 word limit)

I have a recording saved of my eighth-grade graduation, where one of my classmates delivered an appropriately fawning, adulatory paean on my exemplary characteristics. I have treasured that moment, my “rosebud,” if you will, and suitable time has been spent henceforth on reliving that former glory.

##### Name one thing you are looking forward to experiencing at Stanford. (50 word limit)

An environment of peers and professors who will be sophisticated enough to truly appreciate me in my myriad, multifaceted talents; only such a distinguished community of enlightened folks as Stanford will provide the satisfaction I know I deserve. I know henceforth I shall have imparted a once-in-a-lifetime feeling upon them.

##### Imagine you had an extra hour in the day — how would you spend that time? (50 word limit).

Appreciating the finer things in life—the trilling of birdsong on the patio, Don José’s laments in *Carmen*, the luminous radiance of my 500-count bed sheets, authentic tieguanyin from Fujian; this latter gustatory experience has led me to henceforth resolve to enlighten my future peers and broaden their limited horizons. 

##### The Stanford community is deeply curious and driven to learn in and out of the classroom. Reflect on an idea or experience that makes you genuinely excited about learning. (100 to 250 words)

A fundamental truth which my history teachers have imparted on my eager, young mind is that those who do not study the past are doomed to repeat it. I find this a defeatist perspective: history deserves to be reiterated and expanded upon, its fractal forms reprised through posterity. The prospect of being the vanguard of one of these movements, revitalizing and improving what less innovative minds designed before, titillates me; when I first read of the historical figures of yore, Julius Caesar and Napoleon, I henceforth resolved to do what they were incapable of and remodel the world in a better, more harmonious mold. 

This sacred responsibility I have taken upon myself drives my attitude in the classroom: all historical events are fuel for the fire of invention, timber to be sawed together or ground into dust—Hephaestus’ artistry cannot compare to the mental machinations I must go through to stoke the flames of intellectual development. Those of my peers or my gracious mentors who understand this well-reasoned perspective may once rise above their stolid positions as mere teachers or students, and henceforth join me in a brave new world, and those who do not are doomed to fail. At Stanford, I hope all are of the former group.

##### Virtually all of Stanford’s undergraduates live on campus. Write a note to your future roommate that reveals something about you or that will help your roommate — and us — know you better. (100 to 250 words)  

Dear future roommate,

I am excited to meet you, and I know you are excited to meet me. Together, with my guidance, we shall accomplish greatness. 

Sometimes, as I lie in blissful contemplation, I ponder what our purpose in the universe is. I believe some are destined to be the Da Vincis and Teslas, tirelessly exerting themselves trailblazing new paths for all of us; others are the shoe-shiners of the world, content in their oyster to live a simple life, unaware of the value pearls provide. I am of the former group, and I hope you are too.

Still, all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. We must discuss practical matters too, as I will have plenty of time to exchange my pearls of wisdom with yours. Firstly, you must appreciate opera and jazz, as this is what we will listen to; if you disagree, I will help you see the light. Secondly, I am reserving sole access to our mini fridge, sink, mirror, and shower, as unfettered access to these devices preserves my holistic well-being. You are smart, I am sure, so you will cope well.

Often in life we are tested in times of hardship, and we are defined by how we react. I understand this will be a difficult experience for you, expanding your mental horizons, but at some point henceforth we must all learn to swim in the vast ocean of life. I will then be your pool noodle and help you swim, so do not worry. You are not alone.

Best,

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

##### Tell us about something that is meaningful to you and why. (100 to 250 words)

I have a pet term for what most would consider mental refinement, pushing the boundaries of the intellect: “thinkification.” This takes many forms in my daily life: I may thinkify when reading Camus’ *The Stranger* or Ibsen’s *Et Dukkehjem*; I may also thinkify when casually writing poetry (a noble pursuit which like many subjects, I have a natural acuity for). Only a thoroughly thinkified mind could, in the course of its daily dalliances, write such poetry as this ode to soy sauce:

To drink thee in thy inky, ebon form,

Thy flowing drops cascading down my spoon,

The briny fumes a swirling, pounding storm.

My sushi dances through thy dark lagoon,

its salmon, tuna blending into one,

Voracious tides submerging sticky rice;

The bacchanal of feasting has begun!

About this pleasure I’ll remain concise: 

When guzzling flasks of saline liquid gold,

Ambrosial darkness meeting shrouded lore,

I wonder why we scorn our friendly mold—

Oh how I love the aspergillus spore!

If anyone abhors divine soy sauce,

I shake my head and think—gee, what a loss!   

Thinkification is important to me because it best equips me for making the world a better place; only a mind suitably honed on the whetstone of intellectual challenge will develop the vivacity necessary to tackle daily challenges of great importance. Ministers of our intellectual profession like Nietzsche and Kierkegaard may tackle weighty matters of life and death, but if henceforth those of that caliber may thinkify a bit more, they, too, shall be great.
