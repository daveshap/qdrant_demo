Salary Issues
I’ll keep this short and sweet! I’m currently finishing a year training program in which I was paid $35,000 (I have a 4 year psych degree where I had a 3.81) and was just promoted to branch manager. I’m responsible for an 8 million dollar a year revenue office and have full management responsibilities. I’ve taken on a huge workload and work a minimum of about 50 hours a week. I was just told today (been with the company a year) that my raise was to $36,500. Unfortunately the amount is non-negotiable. Is it time for me to go or should I stay? I feel this isn't even fair for an annual increase let alone a promotion. I do have 2 internships under my belt prior to this position.
