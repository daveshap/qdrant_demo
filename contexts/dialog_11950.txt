HOLLY: She really does, though.
LEE: Yeah, she knows it, too, 'cause she's flirting with all the men here.
HOLLY: God.
HANNAH: Maybe when she's eighty, she'll stop straightening her garter belt when there's a guy around.
HOLLY: I should get a garter belt.
LEE: Yeah.
HOLLY: Get a garter belt... Get a garter belt and flirt.
LEE: Where are the antihistamines?
HANNAH: Oh, I don-- Ask Elliot for that. Uh, he's got them somewhere.
LEE: Okay.
HOLLY: Frederick didn't come with her.
HANNAH: When does Frederick ever come with her?
HOLLY: Tch. He's such an angry...he's such a depressive. I thought she was moving out!
