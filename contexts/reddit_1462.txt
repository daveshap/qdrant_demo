Anybody else ever spend so much time in your head, that when you get up to do something your brain feels totally fried?
I (20F) know it’s bad for my anxiety but all I’ve done today is lay around in my pajamas posting on here and worrying about my current situation or my future or the possible problems my relationship might encounter even though NOTHING is wrong between us right now. 

I think about having a possible nervous breakdown from worrying so much, then having to go to a mental institution, then becoming severely depressed while there because I’m so ashamed of myself for getting to that state, then having a suicide attempt because I can’t take it all. Or how I feel trapped physically and mentally. 

Meanwhile I’m just sitting on my toilet writing this. I’ve been running through these thoughts all day. But now my energy is so low that I don’t know what to do. 

I need to go do something productive because my mind is eating itself. 

Except now I have more anxiety because I feel like I’m in a dream or just floating around since my brain is so exhausted. And now I’m thinking “what if this is dissociation or depersonalization?” That gives me more anxiety. 

I want to sleep but then I think about how sleep is bad for me in this situation too. 

**Lmao**. I hate bad anxiety days man. Hopefully tomorrow is better. 

Love you all ❤️
