GLORIA: Do we know who fired the missile that killed the president?
COLONEL OLIVER: No. But I fear it's intention may have been to kill the peace accords and spark a civil war between the Hutu Militia and the Tutsi rebels.
GLORIA: We've heard reports of reprisal killings. Will the UN intervene to stop the bloodshed.?
COLONEL OLIVER: Unfortunately we're here as peace-keepers not peace makers, we can't take an aggressive role.
GLORIA: If the UN changes your mandate could you stop the bloodshed?
COLONEL OLIVER: Yes. With some re-inforcements I'm confident we could impose order.
GLORIA: Have you requested re-enforcements?
COLONEL OLIVER: Yes we have.
GLORIA: What was the response?
COLONEL OLIVER: We're awaiting a decision, excuse me.
COLONEL OLIVER: Paul, I've sent my soldiers to rescue the Lady Prime Minister, she'll need a room.
PAUL: Yes sir, but these people they cannot stay here. I've heard you have a refugee center at the airport Stadium?
COLONEL OLIVER: I'm sorry, I can't possibly take them Paul. I'm overrun with refugees. As soon as we can stabilize the situation we'll take them.
JOCK: For fuck's sake, Gloria There's a big news story out there! We need to get out and cover it.
GLORIA: Weâ€™re not going outside the hotel grounds unless we have an armored car. That's the ground rules.
JOCK: Ground rules! Where the fuck do you think you are, Wimbledon?
GLORIA: We cover the story from here until we can get proper protection.
