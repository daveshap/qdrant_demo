JENNIFER: I got all the plastic stuff. What should I do with it?
KIMBERLY: Throw it out.
NICOLE: I really was way way too too.
KIMBERLY: Oh, please! When she ran onto the field in the middle of the game? Was that the most out-of-it thing ever, or did I blink?
NICOLE: I'm, like, yelling at her, 'What are you doing?' And she's going 'Jeffrey, Jeffrey!' Way mental.
JENNIFER: Hi, Buffy.
BUFFY: Hi, guys.
KIMBERLY: You were supposed to be here at three.
BUFFY: I forgot.
KIMBERLY: Buffy, what is your sitch? You're acting like The Thing From Another Tax-Bracket; it's too weird.
BUFFY: Look, a lot's been going on. That's what I wanted to tell you guys about. I need to tell you. You see... a while ago, I met this guy --
KIMBERLY: Oh my God you're having an affair.
NICOLE: Cool!
JENNIFER: Does Jeffrey know?
