SAM: We thought, if you didn't mind, we'd go out to the motel with you.
MRS. CHAMBERS: He's already been.
SHERIFF: Went out before service.
MRS. CHAMBERS: Have you two had breakfast?
SAM: You didn't find anything.
SHERIFF: Nothing. Here, let's clear the path.
LILA: Did he say anything about my sister?
SHERIFF: Just what he told your detective.
SAM: No mother.
SHERIFF: You must've seen an illusion, Sam. Now, I know you're not the seeing- illusion type... But no woman was illusion there and I don't believe in ghosts, so there it is!
LILA: I still feel...
SHERIFF: Can see you do. Sorry I couldn't make you feel better. You want to come to my office this afternoon and report a missing person... And the theft, is what you want to do! Sooner you drop this thing in the lap of the law, that's the sooner you'll stand a chance of your sister bein' picked up. How about that?
LILA: I don't know.
