BEAUMONT: John Henry Patterson, come in. I'm Robert Beaumont. Firm- I like that, tells me a lot about you- -now why don't you tell me about me? To get you started, many people find me handsome, with a wonderful smile. I'm sure you agree. Winning personality, heaps of charm?
PATTERSON: My wife is the game player in the family, sir.
BEAUMONT: Games? Look at me closely, Patterson: I am a monster. My only pleasure is tormenting people who work for me, such as yourself. One mistake and I promise you this: I'll make you hate me.
