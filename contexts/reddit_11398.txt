I saw a picture of my first real girlfriend with an engagement ring, and it's making me feel a world of weird.
So I'd gone out with loads of people before her, but she was The One, or so I thought at the time. I lost my virginity to her last year after a good quarter century or so [don't laugh]. Well, she wanted other things, and we parted very amicably [or so it seemed] and I've tried my damn hardest to get over her [working on myself, waiting, dating other people, the works], and only giving into the vice of "talking" to her once in 9 months. I was tired and emotional, if you catch my drift, but the feeling never faded.

I'm with a wonderful girl right now, and I hope things work out between us [but I have a sneaking suspicion they won't]. Anyway, I was looking at wedding photos in which a mutual friend had been tagged in, and I saw her. In the background. With a ring.

Now call me juvenile, but everafter still scares me. I did miss her, yes, but the fact that you could make that promise so soon after what we had - well, it makes me think. That my current relationship is not the one. That I'm not taking relationships seriously. That maybe I'm not as emotionally mature as I thought.

I think I should go ahead and break up right now and not cause the amazing girl in my life right now any more distress. I'm just worried of hurting her, as she's been through a lot. 

I need help responding to things.
