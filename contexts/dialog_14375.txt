PAUL: That's as straight as I can put it. And don't tell me that I'm crazy 'cause I know I'm not. I'm goin' to Hell. They're comin' after me.
JACOB: Who is?
PAUL: They've been followin' me. They're comin' outta the walls. I don't trust anyone. I'm not even sure I trust you. But I gotta talk to someone. I'm gonna fly outta my fuckin' mind.
PAUL: Sorry. Sometimes I think I'm just gonna jump outta my skin. They're just drivin' me wild.
JACOB: Who, Paul? What exactly ... ?
PAUL: I don't know who they are, or what they are. But they're gonna get me and I'm scared, Jake. I'm so scared I can't do anything. I can't go to my sisters. I can't even go home.
JACOB: Why not?
PAUL: They're waitin' for me, that's why.
