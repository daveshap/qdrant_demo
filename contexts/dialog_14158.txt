GORDON: Get out of here!
PETER: Wait a minute, Gordon—I—
GORDON: Get out!
PETER: Joe, listen—
GORDON: Don't Joe" me."
PETER: Okay, Joe. Listen—you know I've always liked you. Anytime I could do you a great turn—anytime I ran into a story that looked good—I always came running to you, didn't I? Well, I got one now. Those wires I sent you were on the level. It's the biggest scoop of the year. I'm giving it to you, Joe.
GORDON: You mean about the Andrews' kid?
PETER: That's it. I got it all written up. Ready to go. All I want is a thousand dollars.
GORDON: A thousand dollars! Get out of this office before I throw you out bodily.
PETER: Don't get sore, Joe. This is something you got to do for me. I need a thousand dollars—and I need it quick. I'm in a jam.
GORDON: What's the thousand bucks for?
PETER: To tear down the Walls of Jericho.
GORDON: What!
PETER: Never mind . . . Listen—suppose I should tell you that Ellen Andrews is going to have her marriage annulled.
GORDON: Huh?
PETER: That she's going to marry somebody else.
GORDON: You're drunk.
PETER: Would an exclusive story like that be worth a thousand bucks to you?
GORDON: If it's on the level.
PETER: Well, I got it, Joe.
GORDON: Who's she gonna marry?
PETER: It's all right here. Give me the thousand and it's yours.
GORDON: I wouldn't trust you as far as I could throw that desk.
PETER: Wait a minute, Joe. Use your bean. I couldn't afford to hand you a phoney yarn, like that. I'd be crazy. There isn't a newspaper in the country'd give me a job after that! I could go to jail!
GORDON: I'd put you there myself.
PETER: Sure. I wouldn't blame you, either.
GORDON: Who's the guy she's gonna marry?
PETER: I am, Joe.
GORDON: You!
PETER: Yeah.
GORDON: Now I know you're drunk. I'm going home. Don't annoy me any more.
PETER: For heaven's sake, Joe—stop being an editor for just a minute. We've been friends for a long time, haven't we? You ought to know when I'm serious. This is on the level.
PETER: I met her on a bus coming from Miami. Been with her every minute. I'm in love with her, Joe.
GORDON: Well, I'll be—
PETER: Listen, Pal—you've got to get this money for me. Now. Minutes count. She's waiting for me in an auto camp outside of Philadelphia. I've got to get right back. You see, she doesn't know I'm gone. A guy can't propose to a girl without a cent in the world, can he?
