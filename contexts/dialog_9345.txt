HAROLD: Hamilton, come over here. What is that you've got on?
BRAD: This is how I dress all the time.
HAROLD: But you took off your Captain Kidd uniform.
BRAD: I thought I'd take it off for the drive over to IBM. It's kind of uncomfortable.
HAROLD: Come on, Hamilton. You're going over there to represent Captain Kidd Fish and Chips. We have stores all over Southern California. Part of our image, part of our appeal is in our uniforms. You know that!
BRAD: You really want me to put all this stuff back on?
HAROLD: Yes. I think so. Show some pride, Hamilton.
