Did I make a mistake in communicating with this prospective employer who seemed interested in me, or was I just unlucky?
Hi all, first-time poster here.

I graduated in May with a degree in Music Technology and Composition, and began applying to jobs about a month ago after a busy summer. I came across a posting from a UK-based company for a freelance audio producer position in New York, which is right up my alley in-terms of technical knowledge and work experience. It may be worthwhile to note that while the position is in audio/podcast production, the majority of the company's business is \*not\* in that field.

About two weeks after applying, an employee (I'm not sure of their position) — let's call them Jim for the purposes of this post — contacted me by email with the following message:

>Hello u/iam_hexxed \- thanks for getting in contact, we're getting ready to move forward with this role, I wanted to check what your current availability was. We are potentially looking for someone to work with us in early October.   
>  
>Also could you confirm your day rate: thank you  
>  
>jim lastname

While I do have an existing day rate, I knew that a) it would be well under market for the area and b) that this job was a step up, and that I should ask for more than my current rate. After reaching out to some mentors in my field, as well as the r/audioengineering sub (see post \[here\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/audioengineering/comments/d8qedw/how\_do\_you\_set\_your\_day\_rates/](https://www.reddit.com/r/audioengineering/comments/d8qedw/how_do_you_set_your_day_rates/))), several people I asked said that a key piece of information I needed to know was whether I would be paid via a 1099 as a contractor or as an employee before I could give them a rate. This made sense to me because, while the position had "freelance" in the title, it also listed several benefits that would only be given to employees (IRA contributions, etc.), so I didn't feel that I could infer the answer. Mentors and members of the audio engineers' sub also encouraged me to ask whether I would at any point be using my own equipment, which merits a higher rate for maintenance etc. So, early that same evening, I replied:

>Mr. Lastname,  
>  
>It's great to hear from you!  
>  
>I'm shortly relocating to New York from \[nearby city\], and with that slated my calendar is wide open — early October definitely works. As far as the rate goes, that depends upon whether or not I would be considered an independent contractor on a 1099. Can you clarify that? In addition, please let me know whether or how often I would be expected to use my own equipment?   
>  
>Thanks very much,  
>  
>u/iam_hexxd

The next day, which was a Wednesday, around 12 noon:

>u/iam_hexxd \- to be honest, I dont know the answers to your questions, I'm afraid but i'd be happy to set you up on a call with one of the producers here so he can explain it in more detail. ​  
>  
>in the meantime I'll look into how you will be paid.   
>  
>would you be free for a call at 3pm Uk time which I think is your 10am

You'll notice that this message arrived in my inbox \*after\* the suggested call time based on the timestamp, so this wasn't possible. Still, I felt excited because they seemed interested in me. I replied about an hour after receiving the message:

>Hi Jim,That's no problem at all! I appreciate your honesty on that. Unfortunately, it looks like for some reason this message didn't reach my inbox until well after 10 am EST. I'm traveling tomorrow, so do you think we could arrange a call for some time on Friday?Many thanks,u/iam_hexxd

I received no reply until today, which was six days later:

>Hi u/iam_hexxd,  
>  
>We’re just writing to you to let you know we’ve reviewed your application for the ... position and unfortunately, it has not been successful this time.  
>  
>We really appreciate you taking the time to apply and please be assured your application was reviewed and given full consideration.  
>  
>Thanks for your interest in \[company name\].  
>  
>Kind regards,  
>  
>jim lastname

My question is, did I make some mistake in the process of communicating with this employer that might have upset them and caused them to pick a different candidate? Perhaps I'm naïve, but it seems as though they were interested with a back and forth happening, and then they suddenly went silent, five days went by and I got passed over. I'm pretty bummed because it feels like in following the advice of mentors (one of them said to me "you should definitely ask if it's a 1099 before giving a rate"), I lost out on a good job opportunity which has been hard to come by so far.

TL;DR: not sure if something in my emails (see above) with a prospective employer for a freelance audio production job caused them to change their mind about my candidacy.

Note: I have changed some details to protect my privacy and the company's, but they have been changed to accurately reflect the situation (i.e. where the employer did not capitalize their name, I did not, and I removed my current town for privacy reasons)

Thanks in advance!
