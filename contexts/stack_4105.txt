Can I apply for a UK visit visa as a foreign student in Malaysia? My elder brother wants me to visit him in the UK. He has been a British citizen for over 30 years. I am studying in Malaysia. I am from Nigeria. Should I apply from Malaysia or go back home and apply for my visa? I am financially secure but unemployed. If I apply from Malaysia, I have all the documents from my school and financial statements, but if I go back home, I'm unable to back up my documents and I can't use my Malaysia permit to apply in Nigeria.
