Student loan cap question
 So there is a new proposal to congress for caps on student loans. Just wondering- if it goes through when do you think it would take effect? Like what's the soonest? Do you think it would still apply if you are in the middle of a program or do you think it would just be for new student borrowers likely? Sorry I dont know muvh about any of this.
