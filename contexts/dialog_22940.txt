LLOYD: Hello Constance. It's me, Lloyd... nothing, I'm just driving around... she broke up with me... what do I do? Can't she come back? How can I get her back?... I can't think, talk to me... I fucked up... I feel like crying... she gave me a pen. I gave her my heart and she gave me a pen.
CONSTANCE: Lloyd, honey, just come home, okay?
LLOYD: I'll be home soon.
