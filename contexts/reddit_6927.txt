My mom unexpectedly lost her job today. My brother and I are in college. What can/should I do?
My mom's job was in the legal field working for an insurance company. She made $125k/year and her job paid most of my family's expenses. Now my parents' household income is my dad's $75k per year job. I'm currently a junior in college and my brother just started college a couple weeks ago. I have no idea what I should do or what I can do to help her/my family. Has anyone been in a situation like this or know what I can do to help?
