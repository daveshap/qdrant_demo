3rd Year College Student - No clubs, no internships
Hello everyone, 

I am looking for guidance as a third-year college student who has not joined a club nor had an internship to this day. 

Background \~ 

First-generation college student who started off as a CS major upon entering college, but couldn't follow through with it. I have always excelled in stem and participated in summer programs during high school (top 4%) at Stanford University where I took programming classes. I forced myself to pursue this major, failed again and again, was kicked out of my 4-year university but managed to get back in somehow, but now I am a Sociology major. I feel disappointed in myself and feel really lost in this new major, but alas, I'm trying to make the best out of my situation, I'm grateful for still being school.

However, I would love to start building my resume. So far it only consists of minimum wage jobs that I took up in college (Round Table Pizza, Pizza Hut, and Blaze Pizza), nothing related to sociology. So far, I have applied to 12 jobs/summer internships and have yet to hear back. Not sure what I should be doing right now to give myself a higher chance of finding a job out of college.

Major GPA: 2.8

Cumulative: 2.5

Not really interested in pursuing graduate school right now because of the costs and my grades are poor.  Currently $13k in debt through student loans, which is not bad at all, but I would like to be better informed before I act out of panic.

Thank you very much for taking your time to read this.
