The sad thing about suicide is that people make it about themselves and then life goes on.
People talk about how hurt they are or how confused...that they never saw it coming...others encourage them by saying that no one could have stopped it or that no one would've known that the suicidal person was in pain during their time on earth. People spend so much time making their suicide about them that they forget that they could have done something about it..that they could have reached out to the person before it was too late. 

It makes me sick. People post on social media about how heart broken they are, add their 'thoughts and prayers are with their family' bull crap, a few hashtags and boom. They're absolved of all guilt and pain and go on with their lives. I hate society. I hate the way people make tragedy about themselves and then go on with their life. I refuse to live in a world where a person could feel so helpless, so lonely, so depressed, so troubled, that they take their life...only to be left behind by people that don't think of a solution to prevent suicide, but rather about how hurt they are and how much it has affected them. What about the pain that you may have contributed to this persons life? Everyone acts as if it isn't a preventable thing when it is. Oh, well.

In other words. I'm done living in a world overflowing with so much ego. I'd rather be dead. Goodbye cruel world.
