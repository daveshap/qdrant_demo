I feel hopeless
I came up with a list of how the world would be a better place if I wasn’t in it. I was able to think of 20 things. After that, I tried to come up with how I make it a better place. I couldn’t even think of 1. I feel like I should just do everyone around me a favour and go through with it, but I’m too much of a coward to do it. I know I won’t do it but it’s all I can think about. I don’t wanna die, but I don’t wanna live anymore.
