YOLANDE: Your health and happiness has always been my first concern, Charles... ever since you were a little boy -- and I think I know you better than your own mother...
CHARLES: You think?
YOLANDE: Mmmm. Yes. I know for example the sickness that plagues your heart. I know how painful it is for you... to have loved a father... without ever knowing if he really was yours.
CHARLES: W-w-what has that got to do with this Maiden?
YOLANDE: Who better than a messenger from God to give answers to your questions?
CHARLES: You really think she's been sent... by God?
YOLANDE: You're a fine judge of character, Charles. It'll take you less than five minutes to expose her if she's a fake. But if she's not -- then she will give you your answers... and place the crown on your head.
