SALIERI: Tomorrow night I dine with the Emperor. One word from me and the post is his.
CONSTANZE: Oh, thank you, sir!
SALIERI: Come back tonight.
CONSTANZE: Tonight?
SALIERI: Alone.
CONSTANZE: What for?
SALIERI: Some service deserves service in return. No?
CONSTANZE: What do you mean?
SALIERI: Isn't it obvious?
SALIERI: It's a post all Vienna seeks. If you want it for your husband, come tonight.
CONSTANZE: But! I'm a married woman!
SALIERI: Then don't. It's up to you. Not to be vague, that is the price.
