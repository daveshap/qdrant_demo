GORKON: Your research laboratory is most impressive...
KIRK: Starfleet's been charting and cataloging planetary atmospheres. All vessels are equipped with chemical analytic sensors...
GORKON: This cannot be easy for you, Captain... I would feel awkward if I had to give you a tour of OUR vessel...
KIRK: Would you care to go topside?
CHANG: Very much.
CHEKOV: Captain, you're not going to show them the bridge??
KIRK: Full diplomatic courtesy, Mr. Chekov...
