It's there a way to bypass https nowadays? It's there a way to bypass https (using mitm attacks) on browsers like chrome, firefox, etc?I know it could be done in some way, exploiting the NTP port, but we need the interaction of the victim. And for this interaction to happen we need a dns spoof, which we can't do because all the modern browsers are patched against this attacks.So it's there a way?
