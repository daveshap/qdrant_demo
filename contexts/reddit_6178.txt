Waited over 1/2 hour for a first day no show
I showed up to my first day at a new job, waited half an hour (technically 50 minutes because I showed up twenty minutes early) while I called, rang their comm, e-mailed...and then ended up leaving. The owner invited me back to start working at 12 pm but I decided to not take the roll in the end because I have an uneasy feeling about this place (and this experience didn't help). This has never happened to me in my entire professional career so I was just curious to see if something similar has ever happened to any of you and how you handled the situation.
