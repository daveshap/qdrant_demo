Down to two online MBA programs and wanted perspective from a different sub.
Down to two schools for my online MBA. I am copying what I wrote in r/mba.

Looking for some I put. I’m a licensed engineer in NC. My goal will be moving into Project/Client management faster within my own company or switch to a tech company for Project/Product management. I’ve also been thinking of starting a business as well.

I’m 31, currently make $99k. Would spending $125k for an online mba ( with no option to take an on campus course) at UNC be a better ROI than spending $50k (with on campus course options) at NC State ?

I’m living in Raleigh so commute to NC State is not an issue.

Thanks

Edit: I chose NC State! Hard to say no to my Alma Mater!
