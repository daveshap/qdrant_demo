Hiring process is very slow is this normal?
Had two interviews with this company and manager is thrilled to have me on board. She said HR will call me tomorrow which was yesterday. 
Hiring manager responded to my thank you notes and said hr will contact me shortly.

Well I’ve waited and no phone or email. 
Is HR usually slow? 
At my last job it took about 3 weeks for me to actually start. 

I’m getting anxious and impatient because other companies I applied for are calling me back for second interviews and I literally don’t wanna go to them because I’m waiting for HR from this company to call me back.
