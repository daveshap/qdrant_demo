social media is toxic as fuck
I hate social media... It is a well known fact that it has a lot of negative effects on its users.   


This year, I have deleted all my social media accounts, and people closest to me treat me like a fucking mentally ill freak questioning why I am off social media like people you know I am depressed, and this shit doesn't fucking help!!! And like wtf do you really want me to take a video of my breakfast everyday like fuck off and let me live my life with or without you genuinely in it you noisy fucks.

People it's not healthy to invite everyone into your life, and post a fake summary of how your doing. The majority of users are not happy and they keep this egotistical game of LOOK AT ME going in this circle jerk of likes. WHO THE FUCK CARES!

get over yourself and leave me alone.
