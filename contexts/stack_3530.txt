Are employee or badge numbers PII? We're looking at implementing an Identity Management/Lifecycle system.  We're looking at aggregating all our authentication into this system.  However, one area of concern is same-name employees, so we are implementing an employee number and badge number to differentiate employees and authenticate them appropriately.It is believed that these numbers are PII, thus storing them for cross-reference in any other system will cause that system to fall under PII regulations.Are employee or badge numbers considered PII?Edit for clarificationThis is mainly related to DOE O 206.1 Privacy Directive\u2014and not GDPR.  However, this is slightly more general as I had similar arguments in the past.The issue I'm facing\u2014somewhat exaggerated\u2014is that everyone I know thinks anything to do with anyone is considered PII.  Thus every system needs to be regulated.
