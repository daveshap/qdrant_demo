HECTOR: -- you stole my cousin Enrique's car.
RAPHAEL: Hector, don't interrupt me.
HECTOR: He told Enrique he didn't know anything about his car.
RAPHAEL: I don't give a shit about your cousin's car. We're here about my car. So, shut your mouth! You think you can do that? You think you can keep your big mouth shut?
