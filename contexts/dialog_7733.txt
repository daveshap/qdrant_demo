MRS. TEASDALE: In choosing you, I feel that I serve my country well. I heartily endorse everything you stand for.
GROUCHO: Well, I won't stand for much. And I won't stand for you if you don't show some improvement soon. Look at your report card last month -- D" in spelling... six in behavior. Now who were the six? A fine state of affairs -- no wonder you can't matriculate
MRS. TEASDALE: The future of Freedonia rests upon you. Promise me you will follow in my husband's footsteps.
GROUCHO: I haven't been on the job five minutes and already she's making advances to me. Not that I care -- but where is your husband?
MRS. TEASDALE: Why - er -- my husband passed away... I was with him to the very end.
GROUCHO: No wonder he passed away. I'd like to be with you to the very end. Can't you see what I'm trying to tell you -- I love you.
MRS. TEASDALE: Your Excellency!
GROUCHO: You're not so bad yourself, Mrs. Teasdale, when I look at you I can see that we're facing a crisis. We've got to balance the budget -- we've got to cut down everything including, you.
