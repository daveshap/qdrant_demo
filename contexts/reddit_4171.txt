Women tend to have higher physical standards for hookups and men created that monster.
I've been reading on reddit how some guys think women have it good. No! OLD sucks for a lot of us. 

Me, 31F, do get matches even from hot guys but guess what they mostly wanna hook up and I want a relationship. It always leads to Nowhere Land. I stopped swiping right on those IG  model guys because of that. I've tried the whole "no sex unless I'm in a relationship" for like 7 months after I broke up with my ex (we were together for 6 years). I didn't get sex. So when I couldn't take it anymore, I picked the hottest guy who cared to know more than my name and had decent conversational skills. Does that make me a shallow person? Maybe but honestly IDGAF. 

I told a guy last week on bumble, 99% of guys here are only DTF (yeah bumble is slowly turning into Tinder 2.0) whereas a lot of women want relationships. So if i have to settle for something that was not my original plan, then you best believe I'd pick a guy I find hot. That would be his one fucking job.

 I've had my own share of "average" guys trying to fuck me only with no strings attached so let's not pretend they don't exist. 

Stop blaming it on women. Blame it on the other guys out there who made it rough for you because they are overly sexual when they approach us.
