CHARLIE: I love you.
PEGGY: I know.
CHARLIE: I think we should get out of here. It's going to rain.
PEGGY: Do you think anybody in the Fifties ever made love on a bed?
CHARLIE: What the hell is that?
CHARLIE: Peggy! Where're you going? Come back!
PEGGY: I've got to go now.
CHARLIE: But I love you. I'll love you forever.
PEGGY: I'll love you, too, Charlie. I'll love you for twenty years.
CHARLIE: Come back to me.
PEGGY: I'm trying.
