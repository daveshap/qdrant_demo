LUTHER: Ambrose just pulled the memory card out of the digital camera and put it into an envelope, put it in his inner left jacket pocket...
ETHAN: Left jacket pocket?
LUTHER: Roger that.
ETHAN: Confirm. Left jacket pocket.
LUTHER: Left jacket pocket confirmed.
ETHAN: Nyah, Ambrose is heading back. There's an enveloped inside --
NYAH: -- his left jacket pocket.
ETHAN: Affirmative.
NYAH: Where do I meet you?
ETHAN: Betting table twelve off the paddock. Nyah, are you up to this?
NYAH: I'll muddle through.
AMBROSE: See anything you like?
NYAH: Yeah. Naturally vain -- but they're about to close the betting table and I haven't a sou..
AMBROSE: Nyah!
ETHAN: Billy, make sure Nyah's not followed.
