JUNO: No, you don't! He does not work well with others.
BARBARA: What do you mean? What's he do?
JUNO: He's a freelance bio-exorcist. Claims to get rid of the living. But he's a troublemaker. He's pushy. He's been sleazing around that cemetery for 500 years.
BARBARA: Our cemetery?
JUNO: Yeah. He still tries popping up all over the place. But he can't join the party unless you call on him. Get the Deetzes out by yourselves! I gotta go.
