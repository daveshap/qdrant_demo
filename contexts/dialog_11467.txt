PREYSING: No news from Manchester yet -- Do you think we ought to postpone the conference?
ZINNOWITZ: Good heavens no. That'd create the very worst impression. You must be optimistic. You must convince them. You know as well as I do that the merger must go through.
PREYSING: Yes -- the merger must go through -- But I am used to making my deals on a solid basis. I am not a liar. I am an honest business man -- a good husband and father -- I have a sense of honor -- I have nothing to conceal. I couldn't live happily otherwise.
ZINNOWITZ: Well, don't get excited about it. We agreed that the merger with the Saxonia people must go through.
PREYSING: I want to dictate my statement for tomorrow. I can't speak without notes. I like to have things down before me in black and white.
ZINNOWITZ: I'll see you in the morning then, at the conference. Everything'll be all right, Preysing... Don't worry. Goodnight.
PREYSING: Good night.
