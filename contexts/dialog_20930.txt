LANDON: If only we could get a fix.
TAYLOR: What would you learn? I've told you where you are and when you are.
DODGE: Taylor -- quit riding him.
TAYLOR: You're more than three hundred light years from your precious planet. Your loved ones have been dead and forgotten for twenty centuries. Even if you could get back, they'd think you were something that fell out of a tree.
LANDON: All right --
TAYLOR: There's only one reality left. We're here and it's now. You get ahold of that and hang on tight, or you might as well be dead.
LANDON: I'm prepared to die.
