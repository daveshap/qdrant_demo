HOOKER: Will you wait until the chump is played?
POLK: Hell yes. We don't care about the mark. He deserves what he gets.
HOOKER: I mean completely played. Until he's beat and the score is taken. You come in before we beat him and I'll kill him. You'll have a tough time explaining that, won't ya.
POLK: All right, Hooker, but you take it on the lam, and we'll shoot you down on sight.
HOOKER: Just as long as I get to finish the play.
GONDORFF: What's the matter, kid? You're not sayin' much.
HOOKER: Just a little nervous, that's all.
GONDORFF: Luther always told me to bite my toenails when I get nervous. You see yourself doin' that and you realize it ain't worth it.
