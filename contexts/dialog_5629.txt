TEX: Howdy, Miz Lampert.
SCOBIE: Who invited you?
DYLE: Hello, Herman, it was a happy landing, I see.
REGGIE: I'd better call Sylvie -- she must be frantic.
GIDEON: I'm afraid that will have to wait, Mrs. Lampert.
REGGIE: But his mother --
GIDEON: She isn't going to be anybody's mother unless you answer some questions.
TEX: This ain't no game, Miz Lampert.
SCOBIE: We want that money -- now!
