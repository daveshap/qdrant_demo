CANADIAN MINISTER OF MOVIES: Uh, can I finish? Can I finish? ...The fact is that we Canadians are quite surprised by your outrage-

CANADIAN MINISTER OF MOVIES: Can I finish? Hello? Can I finish? ...The United States has graphic images of violence on television all the time, what is that one show? COPS?

KYLE'S MOTHER: BECAUSE IT'S EVIL!!
CANADIAN MINISTER OF MOVIES: Can I finish? Please? Can I finish? ... ... Uh... Okay, I'm finished.
