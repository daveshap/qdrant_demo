TOM SHARP: Well -- we don't mean to force you, Jabez Stone -- but -- it's only for your own good.
JABEZ: I'll look out for myself! ... Now go away -- leave me alone.
JABEZ: Where did it come from?
SCRATCH: Oh, you know the old story -- the Hessian wagon train that was ambushed on the way to Saratoga. Some of the gold has been buried under your barn!
JABEZ: Yes, why shouldn't it?
SCRATCH: Yes, of course, people forgot -- or the men who knew about it died, you know how these things happen.
JABEZ: It's mine?
SCRATCH: That's right, Mr. Stone -- there is -- -- just one little formality. I'd like your signature here -- see. And when it's done -- it's done for seven years. It's our usual form. Of course -- we may be able to take up the question of a renewal in due time.
JABEZ: What does it mean here -- about my soul?
SCRATCH: Well, why should that worry you. A soul -- a soul is nothing. Can you see it, smell it, touch it? -- No! -- Think of it -- this soul -- your soul -- a nothing, against seven whole years of good luck! You will have money and all that money can buy. Upon my word, Neighbor Stone, if it weren't for my firm's reputation for generous dealing--
JABEZ: No, no! Give it to me!
SCRATCH: A pin, Neighbor Stone! I'm afraid, you'll have to prick your finger -- but what's a little pain to a lucky man?
