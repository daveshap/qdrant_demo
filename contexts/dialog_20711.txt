LOUIS: What's up, sugar?
ELLIE: Daddy, do you think Missy Dandridge went to heaven?
ELLIE: At school Michael McDowell said she was gonna fry in hell. Michael McDowell says all sewersides fry in hell.
LOUIS: Well, I think Michael McDowell is so full of shit he probably squeaks when he walks, my dear.
LOUIS: But don't you dare say that.
ELLIE: I won't...is Missy in heaven, do you think?
LOUIS: I don't know, honey. Different people believe all sorts of different things happen to us when we die. Some believe in heaven or hell. Some think we're born again as little children--
ELLIE: Sure, carnation. Like in that movie you rented, Audrey Rose.
LOUIS: Well, it's actually reincarnation, but you get the idea. And some people think we just wink out...like a candle flame when the wind blows hard.
ELLIE: Do you believe that?
LOUIS: I think we go on. I'm not sure what happens after we die, but yeah-- I have faith in that.
ELLIE: You believe in it.
LOUIS: Oh, faith's a little more than just believing.
ELLIE: I don't get it.
LOUIS: Well, here we are, sitting in my chair. Do you think my chair will be here tomorrow?
ELLIE: Yeah, sure.
LOUIS: Then you have faith in that. But we don't know it will be; after all, some crazed chair-burglar might break in while we're away and steal it, right?
