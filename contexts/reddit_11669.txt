Maybe I have no ambition and that makes me feel a big piece of shit
Well the fact is that I don't feel ambitious. I don't want to be an important manager or CEO of a big company. I currently work at a big company as an intern, and even as an intern I am already working my ass off, I feel like I am too calm and slow for that environment, I am very introvert and most people who work there are very fast and extrovert, sometimes I just don't fit in, but working there is a big opportunity for me to grow as a graphic designer, but I am not shure if I can handle it, sometimes I feel like I can't get along with it. I cry almost every day and feel anxious. I have to be creative all the time and sometimes I feel so exausted that I question if I am really going to be happy as a graphic designer. Sometimes I just want to work at a calm and peaceful place but I don't think it does exist. I just want to overcome this and get my shit togheter without having a breakdown. Don't know what to do.
