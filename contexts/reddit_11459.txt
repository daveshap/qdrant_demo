Speaking about my teenage problems
My name is Javonte and I’m a 15 year old boy who’s a nerd that has no life and is socially awkward. I know this might just be a teenage problem but I need to talk about it somewhere. Since I’m socially awkward I have no friends, no life, or no girlfriend all I do is sit in my room watching YouTube and play whatever game I can find on my xbox of course with no friends. 

  I really want to fix these issues but it’s hard for me because I have no one to talk to about this. I’m starting to think about what my future is going to be like whenI try to go for a career if I can't even hold a conversation for more than 10 seconds or will I be able to have a wife and kids( I doubt many females like awkward guys). Having no friends also gave me low self esteem so I tend to avoid having to talk to people because I don’t want to make it awkward so I become socially distant even from family. 

  My awkwardness probably came from my hard time being vulnerable that’s why I’m speaking about my problems on Reddit( it was hard enough for me to write this) and not to my mother because her words won’t really help it’ll feel bland and not very sincere(it’s because I live with her and she knows everything about me except this) I also feel like I’ll be judge upon in a bad way from many people. The answer would be to obviously speak to people more but it’s harder than it looks because I’ve been dealing with as long as I can remember and I can’t just do it because my mind will start to think negatively and I’ll look down upon myself thinking that they probably think I’m weird and strange for whatever reason. 

  I don’t want to be like this forever and I know I have to put effort and work into fixing it but it’s extremely difficult for me and I’m sure how.

  
  Note: Sorry if it was kind of all over the place I’m just trying to put my thoughts into words.
