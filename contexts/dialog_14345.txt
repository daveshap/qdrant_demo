ORDELL: You know who this is?
MAX: Mister Robbie, isn't it? I have the ten thousand you put up. Isn't that why you called.
MAX: The bond collateral on Beaumont Livingston you moved over to cover Miss Brown, remember?
ORDELL: She got off, huh?
MAX: They decided to no-file. Tell me where you are and I'll bring you your money.
MAX: You still there?
ORDELL: Looky here, I know you helped her and I know you know what I want. Jackie can tell me any story come in that pretty head of hers. Long as at the end of that story, she hands over my money. She do that, we're still friends. Now, she don't wanna be my friend no more, tell her to think about ol' Louis. And if she tries to turn me in, I'll name her ass as my accessory. We'll go upstate together. Hand in handcuffed hand. Now that shit's a promise, understand what I'm sayin'? You tell her that, and I'll call you back.
MAX: You're right, that was Ordell. You have time, you think you could find out for me where he's staying?
WINSTON: Cops can't locate him, huh?
MAX: They don't have your winning personality.
WINSTON: Sure thing. I don't have to know what I'm doing, long as you know.
MAX: I think I do. Is that good enough?
