L.A. JOAN: Uh huh.
GREEN: She's been in the hospital two weeks yesterday.
L.A. JOAN: You know anything about the stations here?
GREEN: It's hard to say. Doctors thought she'd come home a week ago. All it was was appendix.
L.A. JOAN: All they got is advertisements. Just like L.A.
GREEN: Did an exploratory and according to them, she needed an overhaul.
L.A. JOAN: Well, I could use one, especially if I'm pregnant.
GREEN: What did you say?
L.A. JOAN: I said, maybe I'll change my name again.
GREEN: I see... Well, those doctors are real miracle workers.
L.A. JOAN: But not unless Nashville really inspires me.
GREEN: Maybe you can look after me a little.
L.A. JOAN: That Tom sure is cute.
