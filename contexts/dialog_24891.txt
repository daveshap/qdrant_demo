MRS. JACKSON: Hello, Mr.Kastle.
KASTLE: Hello, Violet. How's my favorite 'bowlerina' doing?
MRS. JACKSON: 132, 154.
KASTLE: You keep that up Carmelita and one day you'll be a champion just like Mr. Skinner here. What do you think, Theo? Think Carmelita's got the stuff?
THEO: That's some pinfall. Almost a 133 average. Her ball's flat, she needs to work on her spin control.
KASTLE: That's right, didn't you have a slight control problem in a recent tournament,champ? Now go take out your big four"
KASTLE: I get them while they're young. Builds loyalty.
MRS. JACKSON: She hit it, Mr. Kastle!
KASTLE: Four or five years when a girl like that's bowling on the pro tour for Team Kastle, she'll pay a handsome profit on my investment.
