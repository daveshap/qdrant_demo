VERONICA: I don't get the point of me writing a suicide note when we'll just be shooting them with blanks.
J.D.: Get crucial. We won't be using blanks this time.
VERONICA: You can't be serious? Hey listen, my Bonnie-and-Clyde days are over.
J.D.: Do you take German?
VERONICA: French.
J.D.: These are Ich Luge bullets. My grandfather snared a shitload of them in W.W. Two. They're like tranquilizers only they break the surface of the skin, enough to cause blood, but not any real harm.
VERONICA: So it looks like the person's been shot and killed when they're really just unconscious and bleeding.
