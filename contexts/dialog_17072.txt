GRAHAM: ...snuck in the hospital while I was sedated, flipped back the sheets and shot pictures. The only decent thing he did was run a black square over my balls...
CRAWFORD: I know...
GRAHAM: Atlanta and Birmingham can run the thumb print against known sex offenders. Five will get you ten they don't come up with an identification. Jimmie may in the Finder program... if he's ever been printed and in his Index.
CRAWFORD: Say we've arrested a good suspect. You walk in and see him. What is there about him that doesn't surprise you?
GRAHAM: I don't know, Jack. He's got no face for me.
CRAWFORD: You can tell something about him or we wouldn't have found the finger print...
GRAHAM: Don't expect too much from me, Jack, all right? We'll get him one way or the other.
CRAWFORD: What's one way?
GRAHAM: We find an event that connects both families. Same vacation hotel; same hospital, different times. Then we check employees and come up with a male nurse, hairdresser, whatever... If we find out how he found them, then we'll find him.
CRAWFORD: We're running it through the computers now. So far there's no event or service that doubles back into both families. Plus they were big consumers: snowmobiles, fishing trips, scuba, videogames, lots of routine medical and dental. It's a haystack. What's the other?
GRAHAM: He makes noise going in and the husband gets to a gun in time.
CRAWFORD: No other possibilities?
GRAHAM: You think I'm gonna spot him 'across a crowded room?' That's Ezio Pinza you're thinking about. The Tooth Fairy will go on until we get smart or get lucky. He won't stop.
CRAWFORD: Why?
GRAHAM: Because he has a genuine taste for it, Jack.
CRAWFORD: See? You do know something about him.
GRAHAM: ...I'm going to see Lecktor.
CRAWFORD: For Christ's sake, why?
GRAHAM: To recover the mind set.
MOLLY: Hello, hotshot!
GRAHAM: Hey, baby! Where are you?
MOLLY: At the store. You doin' some good?
GRAHAM: None you'd notice. I'm lonely...
MOLLY: Me, too. And very erotic...
GRAHAM: Tell me about yourself.
MOLLY: Which part? That or the day-to-day.
GRAHAM: Let's keep it the day-to-day stuff. How's Kevin?
MOLLY: Kevin's fine. He had to recover the turtle eggs you two fenced in. The dogs dug them up. Tell me what you're doing.
GRAHAM: Eating junk food. They don't have a lock on anything, Molly. There's not enough information. Or I haven't done enough with it...
MOLLY: Will you be in Atlanta for a while? I'm not buggin' you about coming home, I just wondered.
GRAHAM: I don't know. I'm goin' up to Baltimore this afternoon.
MOLLY: To do what?
GRAHAM: I have to see somebody.
MOLLY: I'm thinking about painting the kitchen. What color do you like, Will? Are you there?
GRAHAM: Yeah. Ah... yellow, let's paint it yellow.
MOLLY: Yellow's a bad color for me. I'll look green at breakfast.
GRAHAM: Blue, then.
MOLLY: Blue is cold.
GRAHAM: Hey, goddamn it, paint it shit-brown for all I care... Look, I'm sorry. When I come home, we'll go to the paint store together and get some chips and...
