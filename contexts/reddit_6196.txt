I got hired, but they don't know when they'll schedule me
I applied, interviewed and was hired.  I go on Friday to give them my ss and fill out paperwork.  

They still don't know when I'll be scheduled. It was "we can't put anymore people on the schedule because of the holiday " for this week , then "we're up to our limit for hours next week "  when they called on Sunday, so it sounds like 3 weeks til I MAYBE start. 

This is only a part time retail thing, but is this a red flag? Should I keep applying? Every other job I had I started within 2 weeks of interviewing, seems weird to hire someone they don't have hours for.
