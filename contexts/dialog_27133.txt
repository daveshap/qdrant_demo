FROCK: Please. Don't humiliate me further.
MARGO: Let me help. I can take care of everything.
FROCK: No, Margo. This is one problem you can't solve. You have to stay out of it. The fact is, I want to retire.
MARGO: How can you say that? You know it's not true.
FROCK: Yes it is. I'm tired and I'm no longer needed --
MARGO: My work on fossil intermediates would be crippled without you.
FROCK: With all due respect, dear, that's bull. You dance rings around me with your new technology. You've left me in the dust.
MARGO: Your work is highly relevant. What about your display on Primitive Pharmacology? Cuthbert told me himself he was going to feature it prominently in the Superstition Exhibit.
FROCK: Healing plant use among the Ki tribe of Bechuanaland has been cancelled to make room for Tibetan Erotic Art.
FROCK: Come on. I'll walk you back to the elevator.
MARGO: I'm not giving up.
FROCK: You must.
FROCK: This isn't a death sentence. Greg has promised to teach me fly fishing. I'll garden. I'll write.
MARGO: You are this museum. It won't be the same without you.
FROCK: Everyone needs a change of scenery. I've been rolling down these halls for forty-odd years. That's quite enough.
