Just received a rejection letter by my dream school
Let me start by saying that it's MIT. Now you can tell me how the chances were already pretty low from the get-go, but still. I have been dreaming of going to MIT since I was a kid. I worked my ass off for the entirety of High School and now I'm lost. I honestly thought I had a chance of getting in, or at least wait-listed. But I got completely rejected. If you check my comment history you will see my thoughts in the MIT subreddit, and a discussion on getting rejected.

So yeah, dreams have been crushed today. That's what's bothering me.

**edit**: I am still waiting on decisions by Harvard and Stanford. Do you guys think emailing a professor of CS (my major) would help/hurt? All I want is to :

-express my interest in attending their universities and CS courses

-ask about research opportunities for undergraduate students.

-tell them I hope to be attending their university next fall
