unpopular opinion: in your thirties, the "good ones" are actually all taken?
I always heard "the good ones are taken", and thought "nah, thats just generalizing, there are plenty of people who are single for a reason - maybe it is their career they are focusing on? or they just got out of a bad breakup and was going to marry the person? or they were taking care of their ailing parents".

Then I started meeting single people, going on dates, and slowly realized that the people I went on dates/etc with that were still single in their late twenties and beyond were drastically different than people Id meet who were married/taken etc. like, no matter what happened, the person eventually turned into "ahhhhh this is why she is single".  Either there was some very quirky about their personality, they looked way worse in pictures, they were attractive but just....not pleasant people. or...there was just nothing....attractive about the person? I cant explain it.

As I'm doing this I would meet the most incredible women...that were all married (I'm a social person).  Sometimes I would hear that they met when they were in the lowest of lows...or when they were "focusing" on their career, etc. it was not dependent on the situation, it was dependent on the person. which means to me that people are willing to give "the good ones" a chance, despite where they are in life.

And then my ego took a huge hit. By this logic, I must not be one of the "good ones". there is a reason why I'm not taken...and its probably more something to do with me than anything else.
