O'CONNELL: Sorry, didn't mean to scare ya.
EVELYN: The only thing that scares me, Mister O'Connell, are your manners.
O'CONNELL: Still angry that I kissed ya, huh?
EVELYN: If you call that a kiss.
EVELYN: Did I miss something? Are we going into battle?
O'CONNELL: The last time I was at that place everybody I was with died.
O'CONNELL: There's something out there, you know, something under that sand.
EVELYN: Yes, I'm hoping to find a certain artifact, a book, actually, my brother thinks there's treasure. What do you think is out there?
O'CONNELL: Evil. The Tuaregs and the Bedouin believe that Hamunaptra is cursed, they call it, the doorway to hell.""
EVELYN: Ahmar is Ossirion. Passageway to the underworld"
EVELYN: I don't believe in fairy tales and hokum, Mister O'Connell, but I do believe that one of the most famous books in history is buried out there, The Book Of The Living. It's what first interested me in Egypt as a child. It's why I came here, sort of a life's pursuit.
O'CONNELL: And the fact that they say it's made out of pure gold, makes no nevermind to you, right?
EVELYN: You know your history.
O'CONNELL: I know my treasure.
