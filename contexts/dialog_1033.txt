KAREN: Lloyd, what happened...?
LLOYD: Up to here! That's where I've got it - up to here! Of all the star ridden, presumptuous, hysterical-
KAREN: Margo, again...
LLOYD: And again and again! Two hours late for the audition, to begin with-
KAREN: That's on time for Margo.
LLOYD: Then a childish, heavy-handed routine about not knowing Eve was her understudy-
KAREN: It's just possible she didn't...
LLOYD: Of course she knew! For one thing, Addison told her how superbly Eve had read the part-! Karen, let me tell you about Eve. She's got everything - a born actress. Sensitive, understanding, young, exciting, vibrant-
KAREN: - don't run out of adjectives, dear.
LLOYD: - everything a playwright first thinks of wanting to write about... until his play becomes a vehicle for Miss Channing...
KAREN: Margo hasn't done badly by it.
LLOYD: Margo. Margo's great. She knows it. That's the trouble. She can play Peck's Bad Boy all she wants, and who's to stop her? Who's to give her that boot in the rear she needs and deserves?
KAREN: It's going to be a cozy weekend.
LLOYD: What is?
KAREN: We're driving out to the country tomorrow night. Just the four of us. Bill, Margo, you and I...
LLOYD: Well. We've spent weekends before with nobody talking... ... just be sure to lock up all blunt instruments and throwable objects...
