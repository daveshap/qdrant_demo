KAFKA: ... A piece of paper ...
MURNAU: A mere slip. Your friend Mr. Raban dealt only with claims that came <u>in</u>, another department being responsible for compensation that goes out -- this is correct?
MURNAU: Through a very unfortunate -- and I might add extremely rare -- mishap, a document intended for the one department was sent to the other. And for the first time -- though your friend wasn't aware of it -- two and two could have been put together to make one.
KAFKA: ... A piece of paper ...
MURNAU: You see, Kafka, in all cases relating to the factory at Orlac -- which is what this paper referred to -- the authority that puts in a request and the authority that grants it is, to all intents and purposes, the same authority.
MURNAU: -- You seem amused.
KAFKA: It only amuses me in that it gives me an insight into the ludicrous bungling that in some circumstances may decide the life of a human being.
