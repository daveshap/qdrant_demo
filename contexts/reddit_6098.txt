Job security and lack of HR response. I am down to the wire and seeking some advice.
 So, I'm going to try to make this long story short.

In October, I applied for and accepted to start a job at a world renowned institution in July. In early March, I went in contract to purchase my first home. Fast forward to the beginning of April and COVID-19 in full effect. I am an essential worker but the company annouced hiring freezes, paycuts and furloughs, across the board. I spoke with my manager last week and was ensured that my position is secure and has been justified to HR on their end however, I have yet to hear anything from HR in response to an email that I sent last week requesting an official employment reassurance letter and information regarding said pay cuts and potential furloughs.

It's getting down to the wire, as I am set to move in three weeks and need a letter to verify all of my employment contingencies have been met for my home loan. Though I know it's a crazy time right now, I can't help but feel that HR is dragging their feet. 

My question is, how long do I give them to respond before "bugging" them again (it's been 10 days)? Should I apply for new positions in anticipation of them backing out, due to COVID-19? 

More so, what would you do if you were faced with these issues?

Thanks!
