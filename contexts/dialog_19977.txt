ROSA: I'm not going back on our arrangement. My word is good, and my family owes you. But I think it's best for both of us if you get your own place as soon as you can.
BETTY: Fine.
JOYCE: You're wastin' your time, Roy.
ROY: Look Joyce, I need your key to the files, not advice, okay? This is a complex case.
JOYCE: Nothin' complex about it. Del's dead, Betty's gone. She's probably dead, too.
ROY: You'd like that wouldn't you? You've hated Betty since you were in Pep Squad together...
JOYCE: No... before that.
ROY: Ahh, I hate this town! Places like this just make you small... I should have never come back here after college.
JOYCE: Blah -- blah -- blah... Hurry up, will ya, I got a date tonight...
JOYCE: I don't know what you think you'll find, anyway.
ROY: Names, a phone number, something... Listen, Ballard told me that the guy who brought the missing car down from Detroit was murdered, but do you see him doing anything about it? If Ballard wasn't such a stubborn ass, I wouldn't have to be breaking in here...
JOYCE: What did you say?
ROY: The driver was killed. I think there's a connection --
JOYCE: No, about... Are you talking about Duane Cooley?
ROY: Yeah. Why, you know him?
JOYCE: Know him? We were gonna get married! He was gonna leave his wife for me! Fuck!!...
