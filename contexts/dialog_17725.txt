ISABELLA: I forgot the napkins.
CROCKETT: And the chopsticks and fortune cookies?
ISABELLA: What's the best fortune you ever got?
CROCKETT: They're all the same. Financial security is around the corner." "Your friends love you.""
ISABELLA: In Kowloon, once, I got one that said, Live now because life is dust.""
CROCKETT: Do you have assets somewhere else? Bank accounts?
ISABELLA: Why?
CROCKETT: ...to fall back on. You know, a fail-safe. Insurance.
ISABELLA: Do I need it?
CROCKETT: Everybody needs it. Ask Prudential. Or Allstate.
ISABELLA: 'Cause whatever can go wrong, will...?
CROCKETT: Something like that. The odds catch up with you. The odds are like gravity. You can't negotiate with them. So...at some point, you should cash out, take your money and run...
ISABELLA: Really?
CROCKETT: Sure. As far away and as fast as you can.
ISABELLA: When?
CROCKETT: Whenever. Maybe later, maybe sooner.
ISABELLA: Would you find me...?
CROCKETT: Of course.
ISABELLA: Where would I go?
CROCKETT: Zanzibar. The Comoros Islands. Somewhere in the Indian Ocean. There's twelve-hundred islands there...
ISABELLA: Is this the protective male talk?
CROCKETT: This is the talk of a man...if he were your husband...he would never put you at risk. He would never put you within a thousand miles of anything that could hurt you.
ISABELLA: And if I were in the Comoros, in the Indian Ocean, where would you be...?
CROCKETT: A few more moments, still in this business. Then I'd find you.
ISABELLA: Would you? Because if you couldn't, I would be very lonely... I would have left the only world I know and have known since I was seventeen. But none of this will happen. So it doesn't matter. Because we are on the Guajira Peninsula. And all you see around you...look around... is Archangel de Jesus Montoya- Londono. He is my man. And you are a smuggler moving a load...
CROCKETT: ...in the morning.
ISABELLA: I'll be on board by noon.
CROCKETT: Go ahead.
TRUDY: Too fast. Too many moving parts.
CROCKETT: Switek?
