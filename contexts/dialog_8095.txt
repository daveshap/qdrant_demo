TREVES: You stay with me.
ANNE: Dinner will be served, shortly, dear.
ANNE: More romances for John?
TREVES: Hmmm?
ANNE: ...Freddie! What's the matter? You've been like this all evening.
TREVES: Oh... I've just been thinking about something that man Bytes said.
ANNE: Oh, Freddie. What could that wretched vampire say to upset you?
TREVES: That I am very little different from him.
ANNE: Oh that's absurd, Frederick. No, no Frederick, that's all wrong! John is happier and more fulfilled now than he has ever been in his entire life. And, that is completely due to you.
TREVES: But why did I do it? What was this all for? So John Merrick could live out his last days in peace and comfort? Or so I could become famous?
ANNE: Frederick, just what is it that you are saying?
TREVES: ...Am I a good man or am I a bad man?
ANNE: Oh Frederick.
