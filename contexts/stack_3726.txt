Computing Forecast Accuracy I have 24 months of data of which the last 12 months I'm using to test the forecast for a rolling forecast with a 12 month window.  Let's say I want to test the accuracy of the forecast at horizon 6 (point 18).  How would I go about doing that?  I've seen error measures that use h=6 and every point to the end of the data set.I forgot to mention, the forecasts are based on taking 12 months of data and forecasting the 13th month.  Then the window just moves ahead by one month.  Do I assume that I can only look at h=1 forecast accuracy?
