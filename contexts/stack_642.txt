FAR-manager replacement for FTP I'm trying to get rid of Windows and now I have Ubuntu 17.10 on my second PC but I'm beginner in Linux. Everyday I need to work a lot with FTP (uploading/downloading files). Now I'm trying to find something like FAR-manager (Windows only). Why it is so important? I want to do all the actions with keyboard only, without any need to touch the mouse. When I try to connect with Midnight Commander via \"FTP link\" menu, error appears: \"ftpfs: Login incorrect for user anonymous\". Filezilla works with mouse only so it's not a option for me.What application would you recommend to use for FTP uploads/downloads?
