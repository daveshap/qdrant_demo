FRANK: He's lyin' Mama. He ain't gonna do better.
LINDA: I know honey. Just remember what I said, we'll bide our time. You just steer clear of him as much as you can. Doyle's had a real hard life. It's just about run him crazy I think.
FRANK: We've had a real hard life, too, Mama.
LINDA: You're a hell of a boy, Frank. Someday you're gonna get all the good things you deserve. And Karl here's gonna get some more biscuits tonight. What do you think about that?
KARL: I could shore use some. Thank ye.
