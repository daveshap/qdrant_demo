How do I take a step forward with a girl. I'm 15 she's 17
We didn't talk at all. One day I go to get my backpack and we get a huge eye contact, she just stares at me. Next time in the disco we were in one place so we had a small chat. I said some kinda joke and she said she liked me. After the disco next days in school she didn't even say hi to me. Next time we get a huuuuge eye contact she stares at me for like good 4  seconds. On valentines day we were in a group of like 6 people and I asked who could help me deliver love mails to teachers, cause i didn't know some of them. She volunteered to help me. I don't know if these were good signs and how should I take a step forward. We have a couple of mutual friends. She doesn't even say hi to me in school.
