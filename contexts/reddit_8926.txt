A rational and open discussion of the sitewide protest on reddit right now
We are departing from the usual topic of politics to discuss today's events at the site that hosts our community.

For those who don't know, Victoria, reddit's Director of Communications, better known for running many AMAs, was fired today as part of reddit's effort to [bring AMAs under a common umbrella sitewide.](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/3bw39q/why_has_riama_been_set_to_private/csq6ekp) It's not controversial to say the changeover was [poorly handled](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/3bwgjf/riama_set_to_private_over_mod_firing/csqfgtr?context=7) and that /u/chooter is a [beloved member of the reddit community.](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/3bw39q/why_has_riama_been_set_to_private/csq5hk5?context=5)

This triggered a response from mod teams across the site who cited poor communication from admins as well as lack of tools for effective moderation as they [set their subreddits to private](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditNews/comments/3bwnk6/today_reddit_parted_ways_with_victoria_uchooter/) in protest. Some of these are default subreddits with many thousands of subscribers. Here's an example from /r/history:

> In light of recent developments in reddit staff change and our own troubles in getting the proper support we need from reddit as a company we are setting this subreddit private.

The mods here at /r/NeutralPolitics have decided to provide a platform in which people can discuss these events in a calm, evidence-based manner without personal attacks. Admins and mods alike are invited and encouraged to participate. Everyone will get a fair shake here.

The rules of /r/NeutralPolitics are in effect. If you're new here, [**please read them.**](http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines) Mods will remove comments that violate the rules.
