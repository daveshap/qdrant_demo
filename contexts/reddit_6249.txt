Etiquette? Signed job offer, start date established. Do you check in with HR a few days before start date?
Wondering what the etiquette is here as I’m trying to make the best first impression.

Since most jobs expect 2 weeks notice when you resign, it seems like many people would have 3 weeks before starting at their new company. 

If it has been 3 weeks since you last had contact with HR discussing the job offer, benefits, start date etc is it considered normal to email HR a few days before your start date to basically say “hey it’s been a few weeks since we spoke. Just wanted to let you know I’m still coming and that all the paperwork I sent in is good to go”?

Some part of me is thinking this isn’t really needed. If HR vetted me they’ll know I’m a responsible adult (otherwise they wouldn’t have hired me) and checking in is kind of...redundant?
