Has anyone experienced a scam like this?
So many red flags here we go! They sent me a text with the following..

I know my resume is on indeed but I thought it was strange they straight up offered me the salary. Then they sent this.

The Interview will be conducted through the google hangout app as you have been selected for an Online Interview.Do you have a Google Hangout Application on your Phone or Computer ?

Then this

Can you sign on to your google hangout now and have Mr Jack Smith contacted right  now using your Google Hangout on this ID please mr.scammerasshole@gmail.com    

I go thru answering the questions and they tell me I got the "job".

Long story short. They will be sending me a check so i can purchase equipment from a "trusted" vendor they have used for years. Once I purchase it then I will be able to start my training. 

But they slipped and said they want me online tommorow at 8am EST. I'm starting to freak out if they were able to access my laptop camera. Lucky I was in a low light area. Coincidence? I think not!!!
I looked up the company and they have no open positions for any of the above mentioned. You also have to apply on the website. Smh.. I wish I could catch these fuckers. Im going to play along as much as I can to see how detailed their scheme is.... If it's too good to be true it probably is.
