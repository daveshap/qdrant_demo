Clone backup/restore Ubuntu 18.04 in a dual boot Win/Ubuntu I have a dual boot Win 7 + Ubuntu 14.04LTS + Grub.I mean to have a dual boot Win 10 + Ubuntu 18.04LTS (+ Grub, I guess), with my data in Ubuntu transferred.For this, I guess the right steps are:Clean install 18.04 on top of the existing Ubuntu 14.04.Create a backup copy of Ubuntu 18.04 (partition backup - Clonezilla?).Install Win 10, on the whole disk.Install Ubuntu 18.04 with Grub, shrinking the Win 10 partition, not necessarily to the same size as before.Restore my Ubuntu backup.Assuming I am successful in getting up to point 4, will my restored partition work right away? (without messing up Win 10 or boot)Do I need to take specific precautions during backup/restore (backing up more than one partition, etc.) for the restore to work?EDIT: I could Fresh install Win 10 + Fresh install Ub 18.04 + Recover data by simply copying from a regular backup, as suggested in an answer.That would be steps 3 and 4 above, plus copying.But I would likely need to do the upgrade 14.04 -> 18.04 prior to reinstalling Win, that is why I want to proceed as stated.
