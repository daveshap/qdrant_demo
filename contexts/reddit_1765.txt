TRULY UNPOPULAR OPINION : Online APs are a Necessary Evil
On this sub, it appears the general sentiment is that College Board is some giant scam that purposely created an unfair online test-taking experience. While some of this is true (I certainly disagree with College Board's status as a monopoly and supposed "non-profit"), there are certain parts that I think are just completely false. Here are some of my points...

**1. THERE IS NO EASY ANSWER TO THE CURRENT TESTING SITUATION**

While I understand it is frustrating, I believe it is important to think about the predicament that College Board is in. They must create a standardized test that all universities can trust as a method to gauge course understanding, as well as assuring that this test is accessible and achievable for the average student. As well as this, they must try to maintain the authenticity and security of these results when they are being taken AT HOME. Given all of this information, what all could they really do? If they had decided to import the ENTIRE test online (multiples essays, short answers, multiple choice), students would complain about the difficulty and there would likely be even more technical difficulties due to people's internet cutting out across such a long time span. If they had made a longer test and more relaxed time requirements, it would give students even more ability to cheat and share answers, further compromising the security of the test. While imperfect, I think the current format for test-taking is about as good as they could have gotten it. My only real gripe is that I wish the personalized email option had been open to the first week test takers, but I suppose hind-sight is 20/20. Regardless, I would like to hear if anyone on this sub has a better alternative to the current testing format, genuinely.

**2. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN UNFAIR TO CANCEL ALL THE TESTS**

Another common sentiment I see on this sub is that tests should have been cancelled right out of the gate. This is simply an immature thought in my opinion. If they had done this, I have no doubt that people on this subreddit would have been livid given the fact that they had just been robbed of the opportunity to gain college credit. I know personally, a large number of my friends are counting on their current APs to exempt them from a number of their college classes. While the current testing format is imperfect, I appreciate that given all of this craziness, we are still given the ability to further our education. Additionally, If you truly believe this testing situation is too unfair, College Board is accepting all refunds so you don't have to take them if you don't want to (I understand some schools require you to take the test as a final/mandatory curriculum. I do think this is unfair)

**3. THE REPORTS WE HEAR ARE LARGELY EFFECTED BY BIAS**

I am extremely empathetic of those who experienced technical difficulties when submitting their APs, but it is important to realize that the reports we hear are largely inflated by selection bias. Those who have technical difficulties are more likely to voice their concerns than those who did not. This effect is often called the "vocal minority." Again, while unfortunate, it appears that no test in week one had a failure-to-submit rate of more than 8%. That is still a sizable number and should be considered, but is definitely not the amount that is being portrayed by this sub. It should also be said that those who experienced errors (at least in my class) commonly did not take the required submit time (5 minutes) and instead gambled by attempting to submit with 2 or less minutes left. While this is obviously unfortunate as well, it should be understood that at least some of the submits errors were user-based issues

**CONCLUSION**

It needs to be said that the current situation we are in is difficult. We are taking a test that is different from what we have prepared the entire year for and it is completely fair to be upset. However, painting College Board as this purposely malicious entity is simply not true. I believe there are improvements that could be made on the current system (The retest window should happen RIGHT after week 2, there should have been more stress-testing done on the current website, email option should have been standard, greater accessibility to test taking options), but I also think that the current iteration we have is pretty okay and not as bad as everyone is displaying it as. Regardless, I would love to hear your opinions on the situation.
