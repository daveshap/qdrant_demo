How to achive a many to one merge join in Azure Data Warehouse I have a merge join in azure data warehouse. My estimated execution plan currently shows it as a many to many join. I'd like to know if it is possible to achieve a many to one join. Currently I'm struggling to think of a way to do this as primary keys and unique constraints are unsupported. Is there anything available that would allow me to tell it that one of the tables will always contain unique values.
