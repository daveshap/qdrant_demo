Would it be possible for me to change careers at 44?
I am male 44 with an AA degree in liberal arts and currently work for a union grocery store. I am really interested in changing careers. I have done some research on changing careers over 40 and most of what I find online says to use the skills from your previous job to help get the new career. problem is I don't want to work in retail any more. What I want is to find a career that will not require years of going back to school and has a more stable future. I would like to find a web site that has a list of careers that would be good for someone in my situation. I would appreciate any advice any advice you can offer me.
