JEANNE: Oh, thank you Lord! I'm so glad to see you! I need to confess... I haven't been confessed since Easter... or been to Mass... Will you hear me now?
CAUCHON: I will hear you... but not now, not here.
JEANNE: Who are you?
CAUCHON: Pierre Cauchon, Bishop of Beauvais. As you were captured in my diocese, the duty of conducting the trial falls upon me.
JEANNE: Trial? What trial??
CAUCHON: Your trial, Jeanne. On a charge of heresy.
JEANNE: But... the King -- my king -- didn't he pay my ransom?
CAUCHON: It seems that the English care more about you than the French.
JEANNE: The English??
CAUCHON: Yes. They paid your ransom... tomorrow you will be transferred to their great castle at Rouen.
