SUGAR: Haven't I seen you somewhere before?
JOE: Not very likely.
SUGAR: Are you staying at the hotel?
JOE: Not at all.
SUGAR: Your face is familiar.
JOE: Possible you saw it in a newspaper - or magazine - Vanity Fair -
SUGAR: That must be it.
JOE: Would you mind moving just a little? You're blocking my view.
SUGAR: Your view of what?
JOE: They run up a red-and-white flag on the yacht when it's time for cocktails.
SUGAR: You have a yacht?
SUGAR: Which one is yours - the big one?
JOE: Certainly not. with all that unrest in the world, I don't think anybody should have a yacht that sleeps more than twelve.
SUGAR: I quite agree. Tell me, who runs up that flat - your wife?
JOE: No, my flag steward.
SUGAR: And who mixes the cocktails - your wife?
JOE: No, my cocktail steward. Look, if you're interested in whether I'm married or not -
SUGAR: I'm not interested at all.
JOE: Well, I'm not.
SUGAR: That's very interesting.
SUGAR: How's the stock market?
JOE: Up, up, up.
SUGAR: I'll bet just while we were talking, you made like a hundred thousand dollars.
JOE: Could be. Do you play the market?
SUGAR: No - the ukulele. And I sing.
JOE: For your own amusement?
SUGAR: Well - a group of us are appearing at the hotel. Sweet Sue and Her Society Syncopators.
JOE: You're society girls?
SUGAR: Oh, yes. Quite. You know - Vassar, Bryn Mawr - we're only doing this for a lark.
JOE: Syncopators - does that mean you play that fast music - jazz?
SUGAR: Yeah. Real hot.
JOE: Oh. Well, I guess some like it hot. But personally, I prefer classical music.
SUGAR: So do I. as a matter of fact, I spent three years at the Sheboygan Conservatory of Music.
JOE: Good school! And your family doesn't object to your career?
SUGAR: They do indeed. Daddy threatened to cut me off without a cent, but I don't care. It was such a bore - coming-out parties, cotillions -
JOE: - Inauguration balls -
SUGAR: - opening of the Opera -
JOE: - riding to hounds -
SUGAR: - and always the same Four Hundred.
JOE: You know, it's amazing we never ran into each other before. I'm sure I would have remembered anybody as attractive as you.
SUGAR: You're very kind. I'll bet you're also very gentle - and helpless -
JOE: I beg your pardon?
SUGAR: You see, I have this theory about men with glasses.
JOE: What theory?
SUGAR: Maybe I'll tell you when I know you a little better. What are you doing tonight?
JOE: Tonight?
SUGAR: I thought you might like to come to the hotel and hear us play.
JOE: I'd like to - but it may be rather difficult.
SUGAR: Why?
JOE: I only come ashore twice a day - when the tide goes out.
SUGAR: Oh?
JOE: It's on the account of the shells. That's my hobby.
SUGAR: You collect shells?
JOE: Yes. So did my father and my grandfather - we've all had this passion for shells - that's why we named the oil company after it.
SUGAR: Shell Oil?
JOE: Please - no names. Just call me Junior.
JERRY: Come on, Sugar - time to change for dinner.
SUGAR: Run along, Daphne - I'll catch up with you.
JERRY: Okay.
JOE: What is it, young lady? What are you staring at?
JERRY: You - you -
JOE: This happens to me all the time in public.
SUGAR: I recognized him too - his picture was in Vanity Fair.
JERRY: Vanity Fair?
JOE: Would you mind moving along, please?
SUGAR: Yes, you're in the way. He's waiting for a signal from his yacht.
JERRY: His yacht?
SUGAR: It sleeps twelve. This is my friend Daphne. She's a Vassar girl.
JERRY: I'm a what?
SUGAR: Or was it Bryn Mawr?
JOE: I heard a very sad story about a girl who went to Bryn Mawr. She squealed on her roommate, and they found her strangled with her own brassiere.
JERRY: Yes - you have to be very careful about picking a roommate.
SUGAR: Well, I guess I'd better go -
JOE: It's been delightful meeting you both.
SUGAR: And you will come to hear us tonight?
JOE: If it's at all possible -
JERRY: Oh, please do come. Don't disappoint us. It'll be such fun. And bring your yacht.
SUGAR: Come on, Daphne.
JERRY: Well, I'll be - ! How about that guy?
SUGAR: Now look, Daphne - hands off - I saw him first.
JERRY: Sugar, dear - let me give you some advice. If I were a girl - and I am - I'd watch my step.
SUGAR: If I'd been watching my step, I never would have met him. Wait till I tell Josephine.
JERRY: Yeah - Josephine.
SUGAR: Will she be surprised. I just can't wait to see her face -
JERRY: Neither can I. Come on - lets go up to her room and tell her - right now.
SUGAR: We don't have to run.
JERRY: Oh yes, we do!
JERRY: Josephine -
SUGAR: I guess she's not in here.
JERRY: That's funny. Josie - I can't imagine where she can be.
SUGAR: Well, I'll come back later.
JERRY: No, no, Sugar - wait. I have a feeling she's going to show up any minute.
SUGAR: Believe it or not - Josephine predicted the whole thing.
JERRY: Yeah. This is one for Ripley.
SUGAR: Do you suppose she went out shopping?
JERRY: That's it. Something tells me she's going to walk through that door in a whole new outfit.
SUGAR: Josephine.
JOE: Oh, I didn't hear you come in.
SUGAR: The most wonderful thing happened -
JOE: What?
SUGAR: Guess!
JOE: They repealed Prohibition?
JERRY: Oh, come on - you can do better than that.
SUGAR: I met one of them.
JOE: One of whom?
SUGAR: Shell Oil, Junior. He's got millions - he's got glasses - and he's got a yacht.
JOE: You don't say!
JERRY: He's not only got a yacht, he's got a bicycle.
JOE: Daphne - Go on - tell me all about him.
SUGAR: Well, he's young and handsome and a bachelor - and he's a real gentleman - not one of these grabbers.
JOE: Maybe you'd better go after him - if you don't want to lose him.
SUGAR: Oh, I'm not going to let this one get away. He's so cute - collects shells.
JOE: Shells? Whatever for?
JERRY: You know - the old shell game.
JOE: Daphne, you're bothering us.
SUGAR: Anyway, you're going to meet him tonight.
JOE: I am?
SUGAR: Because he said he's coming to hear us play - maybe.
JERRY: What do you mean, maybe? I saw the way he looked at you. He'll be there for sure.
SUGAR: I hope so.
JERRY: What do you think, Josephine? What does it say in your crystal ball?
