KELLY: We don't mean to invade your privacy but... was he ill, was he sick?
KEOUGH: Was he swallowed?
KELLY: Sheriff.
JACK: Mrs. Bickerman, the reason we're up here... a man was fatally attacked yesterday by some animal in this lake. Do you know how your husband died?
BICKERMAN: Oh yes. I killed him.
JACK: You killed him.
BICKERMAN: Oh, yes.
KEOUGH: And how would you have accomplished this, Ma'am?
BICKERMAN: Well, he was very ill and he refused to go see a doctor and well... I think he had Alzheimer's, he would be coherent one day, incoherent the next and one <u>coherent</u> day, he asked me to end his suffering. I wouldn't <u>do</u> it but he kept insisting and insisting and deteriorating till the point the only cognitive thing he could really do was that I finish him off. Finally I just gave in and hit him on the head with a skillet then buried him under the bulkhead.
