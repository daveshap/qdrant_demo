Do Mementos requests ever expire? In Persona 5, there are requests for the Phantom Thieves to take care of in Mementos, similar in vein to the requests in Tartarus in Persona 3. However, the requests in Persona 3 were listed with a specific expiration date. I cannot find any sort of expiry date on the requests in Persona 5. Are there no expiration dates, meaning I can wait until the end of the game to complete them all at once, or do they expire after some unmentioned time?
