STU: Besides, Julie wouldn't...she'd never...
HYPNOS: Actually, Stu, Julie doesn't get to decide. That's why she was having the nightmare. <i></i> They're pulling the plug at nine AM.
STU: Nine AM! But that's - <u>twelve hours</u>.
MONKEYBONE: I'm so dumb! I <u>deserve</u> to die -
STU: Mr. Hypnos, you run this place. I'm begging you. There's gotta be something I can do.
HYPNOS: Stu, I like you personally, I admire your work, but I'm just the God of Sleep. This is Death's bailiwick.
STU: Maybe you could talk to Death!
HYPNOS: Me? <u>Me</u>, go crawling to Death? My friend, it will be a cold, cold day in Las Vegas, Nevada, before I go crawling to <u>that</u> piece of -
HYPNOS: Now Death is not what you would call a people person, like me. Death is a <u>putz</u> - and I should know. I'm his little brother.
STU: You're Death's <u>brother</u>?
HYPNOS: Oh yeah. Mr. By-the-book, Stick-Up-the-Ass, My- Way-or-the-Highway Death. Believe me - over the course of eternity, you get pretty damned tired of <u>that</u> schtick. <i></i> So I need a job. He sticks me in this broke-down amusement park, with a buncha animals to run it. I'm supposed to be <u>grateful</u>?
