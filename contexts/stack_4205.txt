Astronomy in a universe with two \"straight\" dimensions plus a highly curved dimension So for lack of a better term (I'm sure there is a better term) imagine a universe without curvature as being like a sheet of paper. You have left, right, forwards, backwards, up, and down. Now take this sheet of paper and roll it. Specifically roll it so that it has a circumfrence of one meter. Go up 0.5 m and suddenly you're below where you started by 0.5 m. However this only works for up/down. You're still free to go as far left, right, straight, and  back as you please. (NB: time still functions as normal.) That is the world in which I ask my question. (There is a similar idea present in string theory that features very small extra spatial dimensions of this phenomon, the difference here being this spacial dimension is large enough to notice and interact with.)Now assuming that this universe experienced a big bang releasing lots of protons, neutrons, quarks, electrons, photons, etc, how would this universe advance astronomically? (Assume expansion takes place as normal, and that the one meter thing only applys in that universe's equivalent of today.) What versions of planets and stars would form and how would they interact?
