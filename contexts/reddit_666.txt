I don’t know what to do with my grumpy dad
Hey guys,

I was wondering if anyone had any advice on how to deal with my dad. He’s always yelling at me and he rarely ever smiles. 
He is always grumpy and angry and he never ask anything in a polite way, he just starts yelling at me that I should’ve done something, even if I did something else (like chore) or if I’m injured (walking hurts due to my knee being hurt). 
He’s always been somewhat aggressive towards me and my brother but I’ve always been the one he seems to care the least about. He scares me sometimes as well. 
I genuinely feel like he doesn’t care about me because I have the same character as he does, and my family feels like he does not like it as well. 
Can somebody please give advice?

Ps. 
Sorry for the weird sentence-things but I’m not sure what to write.
