How do I F(M 15) stop this feeling for a teacher(F 30+)?
Hi, I'm just wondering is it normal to have a crush on your teacher/teachers? Because I've always understood that when you're at school, you're there to be taught by the teachers however I've always had a crush on this particular teacher since Year 9( I'm in year 11 now) and I feel like I'm relapsing and I don't want these feelings no more. Like I really like being around her cause she makes me feel comfortable however I don't want to feel horny everytime she walks by. I understand that teacher/student relationships are illegal and I know not to act on my feelings because it's ruin both our lives but I really respect my teacher and I don't want to feel like this around her anymore. I want to feel like I can talk to her without getting horny and frustrated at myself for being like the way I am.
