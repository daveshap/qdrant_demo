made $5k from my side hustle this week and I just have to talk about it somewhere
My side hustle is commission-only and I finally made 2 commissions this week. I have been busting my ass, working nights/weekends, leaving my kids and husband at home for this work when I just want to be with them during what is supposed to be my "time off". But we have to do this; we have to crawl out of this debt. Thanks for reading!
