Career Services Job Search Resources
Hello All

I am a new hire to a career center on a college campus and am still in the process of getting my bearings and learning a lot about the field of career counseling. My supervisor wants me to learn more about job search tools/specifically sites and resources that I may be able to use to assist students from a specific major in finding a job. For example, my supervisor posed the question to me yesterday of how I might find jobs specific to someone who may be in the arts.

Does anyone have any resources that lays out specific jobs that may relate to certain majors (outside of the normal indeed, linkedin and glassdoor).

Thanks!
