These `fuckers` will not shut up and I can't do anything about it!
I'm writing this without want for a solution! I'm just here to bitch really :P

I'm in halls at University and I've sustained a knee injury somehow. Incredibly painful - cannot go out or visit friends easily (or at short notice) and I've been advised to give it as much rest as possible. This means I'm stuck in my room pretty much all of the time.

I'm at the end of an all male corridor full of extremely alpha guys apart from me. All sports players, toned and handsome as fuck, aesthetically perfect in pretty much every way imaginable. Christ, I'm the shortest guy there by 2-3 inches and I'm 6`! All them are tossers and think they are the shit - I realised this early on and have avoided them ever since. Not spoken to them in months.

I knew that they all casually fucked girls on a regular basis, but it took an injury and long periods in my room to realise how often they did (more than daily), how long, how loud etc.  For example, just now someone has finished fucking a girl - they start at 8 and finished around 10. Oh sweet Jesus! It's the worst thing! It's like watching and hearing someone chew food with an open mouth really, really, really loudly on steroids! I was keep up all night on Friday by 3 different people fucking at different times. Fell unconscious after 24 hours awake, and woke up to people fucking again - and so the cycle has continued ever since. 

Every other guy chooses to do other things when this all goes on, but I have no choice. I have to stay and hear everything. Yes, I can hear them through headphones. Full blast does it, but it hurts now after over a week like this. Ugh - I want everyone ever dead now! 

TL;DR - People fuck around me all the time, I can hear everything and I physically can't leave. It's the worst thing! UGH!!
