Short story with government clerk in future dystopia who triggers a revolution I read this in the mid 70's.  It may not have been a new story at that time.In a future society run by a military dictatorship, the protagonist works as a lowly clerk in the giant complex the government uses to keep track of everyone.  He invents a revolutionary figure out of whole cloth by creating a file for him (I'm not sure but the nonexistent rebel leader may have had the first name \"Sam\") and gets the government to waste resources chasing him down.  Naturally, since he doesn't really exist, he can never be caught.I cannot remember if this was some kind of computer tracking system and the protagonist was planting computer records, or whether he was dealing with paper files.After a while the protagonist gets the idea to start planting evidence of secret association(s) with the fake rebel leader in the files of prominent figures in the government - who then turn on each other, eventually bringing the government down.
