Advanced Excel skills but not much else...what kind of jobs can I qualify for?
Well I’m currently unemployed due to a COVID-19 lay-off.  However for the past 2.5 years I have been unemployed on and off as well as underemployed doing GIG work in between jobs.  Had a long term job from 2010-2018 and developed advanced Excel skills (VLOOKUP, INDEX MATCH, pivots, graphs, macros) but did not use any other in demand tools.  So I really don’t have any on the job experience using tools like SQL, Tableau, Power BI, Python, R, Salesforce, etc that would be required for data analytics and higher pay.  

I have been self teaching myself these through YouTube videos but am not competent in them yet.  

Not getting much response to my resume and have been applying to a lot of jobs.  When I have used recruiters like Robert Half and Randstad they only offer me entry level data entry type of stuff.  Me ego gets triggered by this since I believe my skill set in Excel is above the entry-level data entry phase. 

I am 35 years old and fear that I am forever going to be stuck doing administrative work at the junior level making 35-40k.  Was lucky to make 55k at my long term job and have never been able to find something similar since then.  The recruiters I mentioned above only offer me gigs that pay $15-16 per hour and that makes me want to shoot myself in the head.

There are entry level college graduates making more than me and makes me think what was the point of even doing white collar work when I am barely making anything at my age.
