This is the first paycheck that I didn't add to my debt.
I currently have $100 in my bank account and I get paid on Thanksgiving. My fridge and gas tank is full and my bills are paid. This is the first paycheck I didn't run out of money and have to use a credit card to get groceries, I even put money towards the credit card and put some money into savings. By this time next year, I will have a job that pays $41,000 a year. I don't have much, but at least I'm not digging myself further down now.
