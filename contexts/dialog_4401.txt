BILL: We can't go back there. Are you crazy? You saw --
PEARL: It's the only way. It's possible your father may not be dead yet.
PEARL: Your father was his best friend. He loved Jeremiah. So he must hate him the most of all now. He'll take his time. But even if it is too late. If your father is dead. It's not over. The door has to be closed.
BILL: Well, close the fucking door by all means. But don't expect me to go down there and do it.
PEARL: I don't.
PATRICK: You ain't going down there. Not alone. I'll go.
BILL: Fine. But I'm bringing a couple of friends.
