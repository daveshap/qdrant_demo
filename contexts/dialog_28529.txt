1ST REPORTER: What's your next step, Nick?
NICK: Right back to California. We've got to go home and rest up from our vacation.
1ST REPORTER: We'll see you before you go.
NORA: Back to California
NICK: My soul, woman. I give you three murders and you aren't satisfied.
NORA: I want you to stay and find Wynant.
NICK: I did find him!
NORA: What do you mean?
NICK: He was down in the shop.
NORA: Nick!
NICK: It was his body that was buried there.
NORA: Nick, you'd better lay off that liquor.
NICK: That's a fact.
NORA: Wynant's body?
NICK: Yup. Don't you want something to eat?
NORA: But they all said it was Rosebreen's.
NICK: That's what they think... Guild and all of them. They take it for granted that it's just another of Wynant's victims. Guild's hot-footing it around now, looking for Wynant. That's all that troubles him.
NORA: What makes you so sure it's Wynant's body?
NICK: Several things. Hello, Fred. We're hungry again. Yeah, and lots of onions. Oh, and coffee.
NORA: Nick, you'll drive me crazy. What things?
NICK: Huh?
NORA: What things made you so sure?
NICK: Oh. Well, the clothes for instance. They were carefully preserved, and the body was just as carefully destroyed. The person who killed him counted on one thing... that all skeletons look alike.
NORA: Well, don't they?
NICK: Sure.
NORA: You don't get another swallow 'til you really open up.
NICK: I remembered that Wynant had some shrapnel in his shin. It often bothered him. So I looked for it and I found it. Gimme.
NORA: How long has he been dead?
NICK: Couple of months anyway.
NORA: Then he couldn't have committed those other murders.
NICK: Smart gal.
NORA: Wynant dead? Does Dorothy know?
NICK: No. Nobody but you.
NORA: I'm going to tell her.
NICK: Hey... hey. Don't do that.
NORA: But the poor kid's going crazy. She'd rather know her father was dead than that...
NICK: I can't help it. I can't tell a soul. I didn't even tell Guild.
NORA: Why not?
NICK: I want to lie low till I get the whole dope. I don't want to go off half-cocked.
NORA: What are you going to do?
NICK: I'm going to get the real murderer. I've got an idea. Want to see me take him?
NORA: Yes!
NICK: Got a nice evening dress?
NORA: Now Nick, what's that got to do with it?
NICK: Got a nice evening dress?
NORA: I've got a lulu -- why?
NICK: I'm going to give a party, and invite all of the suspects.
NORA: The suspects! They won't come.
NICK: Oh, they'll come. I'll have Guild issue the invitations.
NORA: Who do you think did it?
NICK: Mimi...
NORA: Mimi!
NICK: Mimi, Jorgensen, Morelli, Tanner.....
