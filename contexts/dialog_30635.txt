DARIEN: ...isn't it perfect!
BUD: ...too perfect...let's not even eat. Let's just watch it and think about it.
BUD: You know, the elevator man couldn't believe I paid $300,000 to have my walls looking like this, he's got them for free in Brooklyn.
DARIEN: I'll bet he's got an opinion on the stock market too. This apartment is already ahead of its time. I call it the demolished" look. They've already heard about it at House and Garden and they're coming next week to photograph it before it gets... lived in. Is that alright? I'd love to have it in my portfolio."
BUD: Sure... But your fee... considering you're way over budget, should be negotiable.
DARIEN: Let's get things straight, Bud. I'm not going to take a cut. I worked hard and you can't decorate a room in New York for less than $100,000. Curtains alone...
BUD: I'm kidding, I'm kidding, we're still young, Darien. So what's money anyway when everybody's making it, it's all relative. After all, this is not the house in Connecticut, this is just a crash pad good for a couple of years...before we slip our two lovely kids, Yuppie and Fruppie into the Lycee Francaise.
DARIEN: You got it all charted out don't you, like a stock projection.
BUD: That's right -- one with high yield, rich assets and no downside...
DARIEN: Do you think you're ready?
BUD: It's not me I'm worried about...You know Darien, the only reason we haven't slept together is because we both know we will -- and not knowing when was the only surprise left. You owe me, I want you, what else is there...but you, me, the world. ...right here...make love to me...now... Stop me if I'm going too far.
DARIEN: I'll let you know.
