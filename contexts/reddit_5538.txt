Do i need to mention my year 11 (UK) GCSEs in my CV/Resume as a 16 year old looking for a weekend job?
I am a 16 year old who has stayed almost 2 years in England and i have started school in year 10 (a bit late ik) and finished year 11 with subjects such as Computer science, Sociology and media (and of course English lit and lang, combined maths and combined science) and i have started my A-Levels in September, do i need to include my GCSEs and current a level subjects? Also further advice or help about getting a weekend job would be great help.
