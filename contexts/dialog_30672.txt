CLAYTON: I almost forget when I ate last. It looks so good.... You know, mostly I get my meals in coffee shops and restaurants.
SYLVIA: Don't you live at home?
CLAYTON: No, on the campus. I haven't any family.
SYLVIA: I come from a big one. Nine of us. All in Minnesota, except me.
CLAYTON: I have no close folks. My parents died when I was a kid.
CLAYTON: A big family must be fun...I imagine it makes you feel you belong to something.
SYLVIA: It does...Maybe that's why I feel kind of lost right now.
CLAYTON: We'll get safely out of here, don't worry.
SYLVIA: But they seem to murder everything that moves...!
CLAYTON: If they're mortal, they must have mortal weaknesses. They'll be stopped -- somehow!
CLAYTON: I've been as close to them as anyone. But not close enough for real observation...
SYLVIA: I feel like I did one time when I was small. Awful scared and lonesome...I'd wandered off - I've forgotten why - but the family and whole crowds of neighbors were hunting for me. They found me in a church. I was afraid to go in any place else.
SYLVIA: I stayed right by the door - praying for the one who loved me best to come and find me. It was Uncle Matthew who found me.
CLAYTON: I liked him.
SYLVIA: He liked you ... I could bawl my head off!
CLAYTON: But you're not going to. You're not the kind. You're tired, anyway. You've been up all night. You cracked up in a plane. Slept in a ditch. But you want to know something? It doesn't show on you at all.
