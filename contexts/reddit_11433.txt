I can't help but get depressed every time I see a beautiful woman
I can never bring myself to just talk to women in public. I don't think it's the fear of rejection, but something else. And when I see see them walking somewhere or even just standing alone...I get so sad. I suppose it's the thought of never being able to be with any of them because I don't have the sack to ask anyone out or even say hello. I fear being alone.
