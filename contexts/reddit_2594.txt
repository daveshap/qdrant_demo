Can anyone tell me a job where I wont have to deal with backstabbing co workers 8 hours a day?
So i've had it. I am sick and tired of the information withholding, lies, slander, undermining, fake kindness by this toxic employee I work with in the office. She exerts herself as a boss because my actual boss is never present. I would like to know some entry level positions in an IT field or literally anything else where I will never have to deal with backstabbing, fake traitors again. Thanks
