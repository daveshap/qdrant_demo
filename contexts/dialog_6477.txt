DRAGLINE: Koko, write down their names, don't just make marks.
SOCIETY RED: One rule! No throwing up. He throws up, you forfeit everything.
DRAGLINE: You ever see mah boy throw up? Shut your mouth and put up your money!
DRAGLINE: Why'd you have to say fifty? Why not thirty-five or thirty-nine?
LUKE: Fifty's a nice round number.
DRAGLINE: Damn, Luke. What's the matter with you? what's the matter with me?
LUKE: Nothin' to worry about. We got a deadlock on that mullet.
DRAGLINE: What did I do? Stole and tole lies. I loved mah neighbor and his wife, but what did I do to deserve this lunatic to come in mah happy home and beat me outa hard earned bread.
LUKE: We got it locked in the sock.
DRAGLINE: Yeah, I know. But what we gotta do first is stretch that l'il ol' belly of yours -- git it all strained out, in fightin' shape, like a barrage balloon.
LUKE: You ol' sack of guts. I had a belly like yours, we wouldn't have nothin' to worry about.
DRAGLINE: 'Atsa sign I got me an affectionate nature.
LUKE: Like an elephant.
DRAGLINE: Us elephants may be a lil slow, like in makin' love, but you give us a coupla three days to really get with it an' man -- stand back!
