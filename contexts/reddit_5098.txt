Running in circles due to lack of work experience
 

Hi everyone,

My main account is elsewhere, but I don't like this conversation to be tied to that name-specific account. Here goes nothing, in bullet points:

* I studied journalism, finished about five years ago.
* Very focused person. Usually i'd like to get on with my job, don't care about talking too much.
* Went through hell in the lower educations. Always worked hard, but was on my own a lot. Liked reading and making assignments a lot. Definitely not stupid, but courses like math and physics eluded me. Sometimes my logical mind hicks up, and it's hard to follow and draw the same conclusions everybody else does. In Dutch it's called ''omdenken'', thinking the other way around.
* Motivation came from good grades, but that suffered with higher-performing friends. This ended in a gaming and computer addiction for me, and I know basically everything there is to know about motorsports. Not liking yourself and not accomplishing dates and the usual stuff made me run into these hobbies.
* Extremely generalist with some specialist topics, since I'd like to read a lot I know heaps of info in for example (pop)science, psychology, now going more towards politics. Usually my contribution in conversations is asking questions about topic or person, and popping (fun)facts like Dr House did with Vicodin.
* Getting along with people my age is ok-ish nowadays, but before i couldn't really. only focussed on performing and my mental health suffered, thought I could out-work it. Much younger and much older people is what I click with usually.
* Since half a year getting some treatments with psychological help, and a course about vision. That is starting to kick in, which I'm happy about.
* Motivation is really hard to maintain. I don't know what to do. Trying to clear my clauset first, also with parents, they have a hard life with chronic disease and other private things. Getting things done can be a pain too, and new things usually translate to pressure for me. I have troubles relaxing into things, hanging up a bin by drilling holes can take a long time.

Why I'm posting here, and not elsewhere, is that since graduation it's been a struggle. That was five years ago, early thirties now. The problem is that only in the last year of my studies the bells started ringing, and I started performing. After that I couldn't land a job, since basically the schools flooded the market here with graduates. Then they had a better portfolio, now they are younger too. There is so much work you can do here, but usually unpaid or really poorly paid.

I tried to get some experience in volunteering and doing social media for some parties, did manual labor in the other time (but since it doesn't motivate me at all, I tried to keep that to a minimum) but every time they are interested, someone else comes along and lands the actual job. ''We have found someone who fits our profile better.'' Not sure what to do now, I have a parttime editorial job at a racing website, the first who pay me and decently. Now I am thinking about digging into SEO and marketing/communication, and also I would like to explore the world a little bit (because of culture and what I can learn from that).

How I help people is on a personal level, but at times projects faltered because of my demotivation and self image and I didn't finish them, because I let it go. Only slowly discovering that I can actually write, I'd want to help people and spread positive messages or explain things about problems to prevent or damage control for others. But the way to that point is really unclear to me. What can help me on my path? What should be my priorities? And this is an international subreddit ofc, are there differences from your countries compared to mine?

TLDR: Unsure guy, quite long after certification in journalism, can't get a job in his field since lacking work experience. What now? Vague wish to travel. Also: marketing/communication/SEO certificate?
