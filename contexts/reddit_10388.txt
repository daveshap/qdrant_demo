I can't take It anymore. It's all so overwhelming & no one is listening. I've been practically alone my entire life, I dropped out of school In 8th grade because my anxiety was so severe I just couldn't couldn't go & no one cared enough to make me go. Which means i'm an actual idiot, like incredibly stupid. Honestly I cant even remember how to multiply or divide, It's humiliating. At that time my mother abandoned me along with my siblings at my grandmothers to chase after her boyfriend she met online 8 hours away.  Around this time I got really depressed & cried everyday for like 6 months. I barely ate & stayed inside my room all day with only a TV connected to a cable box to keep me company. I didn't see her much for a year after that. That is until she came back & took me along with her to this small town that I'm in now. I think I've spent all my time on the internet the last 5 years because I've been mentally incapable of anything else. Which means I can't drive, I don't have any friends, family or let alone a job. These are all things I've dreamt of practically all my life & they're so far away. It's becoming unbearable at this point. My mother & I aren't on good terms after she had to make my brother leave because he hit me & I called the cops on him. I don't have any money right now, absolutely no family, no friends & I live in a small town without any real opportunity's available. I'm living off my mother & the minute she decides I have to go I'm going to be homeless. Recently I've been begging her to take me to just get an id & help me apply for jobs. She keeps ignoring me & I know this is my problem but i don't have any money & I don't know what or how I'm supposed to do it. All I'm asking for Is just a job so maybe I can figure things out but I can't even have that. I fucked up & now it's too late for me. My only option is suicide which is inevitable but I'm scared & I want to live.
