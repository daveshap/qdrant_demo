charging lithium ion battery of 3.7v I have a device in which I have used 3.7v of the lithium-ion battery for power supply and for charging this battery, I am using a tp4056 module.when I connect a battery to tp4056, battery fully charges and tp4056 disconnect power to battery and device start run from a battery. when the battery drains approx 30mV, its again start charging until going on full.My device runs from 3.7v to 4.2v.Now I want to make it more reliable for my device.  When a battery has fully charged, its disconnected by tp4056 module and stop giving current to the battery and device start to run from the battery and when the battery drains approx 30mV to 50mV, charger module wakes up again and start charing and it will be affected on the life cycle of the battery.I want when my device is connected to the adapter and if the battery is going full charge then my device should be run from the direct power supply, hence battery charge won't drain until disconnect of power. please help me and sorry for I am not being to explain my problem as professionally. thanks in advance.
