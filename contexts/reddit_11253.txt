This is so stupid, but I never get compliments.
I'm going to try not to be humblebraggy here, I'm sorry. I'm an overwhelmingly average person, on the whole. I take care of myself, I dress simply but I'm well kempt. Looks wise I'm slender and in shape and maybe a 6, but I try and present myself well and I have good hygiene. I've been seriously overworked the last few months and I've had a few comments on my appearance. You look tired, you look like a zombie, etc. It made me realize no one ever says anything complimentary about me...ever. My coworkers are great people and I've noticed they tell each other nice things constantly. Your hair looks good, that color looks great on you, and so on. But not me? And yes, I do say nice things about and to them. Not just since I've noticed this, I just always have because I know it can make someone else's day.

So do I...not look nice? Am I living in an anti compliment bubble? Is this on me or on them? I'm trying not to feel hurt by something so petty when everything else is falling apart.
