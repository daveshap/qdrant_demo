COMMODUS: This is the only place in Rome where I thought -- I believed -- I was wholly in power.
QUINTUS: Narcissus will never support you, Caesar, he has too much of a philosophical temperament.
COMMODUS: Damn him! I should have killed him on the front -- I let you talk me out of that.
LUCILLA: You would have had a full scale revolt on your hands.
COMMODUS: What have I got now? It's exactly as if there were two emperors. Because of this the people have two minds. He is their champion.
QUINTUS: It's because he comes off as the underdog.
COMMODUS: Underdog! How can he be an underdog -- he wins all the time! I'm the emperor why can't I kill him? He could be poisoned, or somehow killed to look like an accident.
QUINTUS: You don't want to kill him. If anything happens to him now you will be blamed... and he knows it. Besides, that gladiator school is a fortress. It would take the army to break in there. What you want is to... offer him the wooden sword. If he takes it, he's no longer the champion of the people, is he? He's gone. And you are a hero for awarding it.
