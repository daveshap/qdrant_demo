JACK: Peter. I don't see you rushing home to trim the tree.
LASSITER: That's because I'm a heartless bastard who only cares about money.
JACK: And God love you for it.
LASSITER: I just got a call from Terry Haight. Bob Thomas is nervous...
JACK: That'll happen when you're about to spend thirty billion dollars on some aspirin...
LASSITER: Someone's gonna have to nurse him through this.
JACK: Why are you staring at my breasts, Peter?
LASSITER: I need you, tiger..
JACK: Where is he?
LASSITER: Aspen.
