HARLEY: Good afternoon. I'm glad to see you up and around.
KLAATU: Thank you... Have you any news?
HARLEY: Not very good news, I'm afraid. The President accepted your suggestion and cabled the invitations for a meeting last night. Let me read you some of the replies. The Premier wishes to inform the Government of the United States that it will be impossible for him to attend the meeting suggested by the President unless the meeting is held in Moscow." "The suggestion of the President regarding the possibility of a meeting in Moscow would be unacceptable to Her Majesty's Government at the present time. Representation could be sent only if the meeting were held in Washington." Well -- there you have it."
HARLEY: I tried to make you understand. The suspicions -- the jealousies -- the mistrust-- Surely you realize that my government has done everything in its power--
KLAATU: It's not your government I'm thinking about. It's your world.
HARLEY: Now that you understand the situation more clearly, perhaps you'd like to discuss the matter with the President
KLAATU: I will not speak to any one nation or group of nations. I don't intend to add my contribution to your childish jealousies and suspicions.
HARLEY: Our problems are very complex, Mr. Klaatu. You mustn't judge us too harshly.
KLAATU: I can judge only by what I see.
HARLEY: Your impatience is quite understandable.
KLAATU: I am impatient with stupidity. My people have learned to live without it.
HARLEY: I'm afraid my people haven't. I'm very sorry -- I wish it were otherwise.
KLAATU: Before making any decisions, I think I should get out among your people -- become familiar with the basis for these strange, unreasoning attitudes.
HARLEY: Under the circumstances I'm afraid that will be impossible.
