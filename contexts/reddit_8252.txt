Sen. Cassidy’s claim that people are paying $40,000 per year for premiums
During the CNN healthcare debate between Senators Cassidy, Graham, Sanders, and Klobuchar, Sen. Cassidy claimed several times that he has met several couples who have been paying extremely large premiums (up to $40,000 per year).

Can anyone provide any details on this claim? Firstly, can someone show that this is or isn’t happening, and if it is, can you explain why?

Clearly this is a non typical situation, but I would like to know what specifically is nontypical about their situation.
