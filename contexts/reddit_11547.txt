Just found out the girl I've been seeing has a boyfriend.
In the last couple of weeks I've been seen this girl. Over the course of the time we've known each other: we've been texting a lot, phone-calls, been on walks together and she has even come over to give me home-made dessert! Though we haven't kissed, (I believe) there is a mutual feeling towards each other, a lot more than friendship.

However one of my friends who currently lives with her, told me that she had a long-distance boyfriend when we were drinking with each other. He assumed I knew already, but I genuinely thought he was joking around. Me and this girl have had some very intimate conversation and she hasn't mentioned him whatsoever. My friend mentioned that they may have had a a bad patch recently, but he wasn't sure.

So I'm not sure what I should particularly do? Do I ask her straight if she has a boyfriend? Should I find out first that she think of me in a way more than just friends? Or should I just wait and see what happens?

Any suggestions? And many thanks for reading. Its just nice to get it off my chest!
