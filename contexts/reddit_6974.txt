Is it unethical to say you are still employed at an old company, if you were recently fired from that company, but they said they will give you a clean reference?
I just got fired from my job (financial services). Reason was performance, I didn't like the job; but I honestly did try my hardest. But in the end, I wasn't good enough at it, so they let me go, performance being the reason. Overall, I would say I was well liked at this company, and most people were upset to hear what happened. I think this might factor into why they agreed to only give future employers my basic information, as well as the dates I worked, no negative feedback on me, just a clean, neutral, but not necessarily good reference.

Everyone knows its better to look for a job when you are already employed, and since this separation happened very very recently (a few days ago), would it be entirely unethical to market myself and speak as if I am a currently employed person looking for new opportunities? Just for the next week or two, so they gap is so small, it could look inconsequential. Or would I be shooting myself in the foot if they call my old job and ask for specific dates of hire, and then they would know that when I interviewed them I was already not working there?
