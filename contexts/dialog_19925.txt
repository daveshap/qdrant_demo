MAX: Absolutely. Never trust a vegetarian.
WILLIAM: Great. Excellent. Thanks.
SPIKE: I was called and I came. What's up?
HONEY: William has just turned down Anna Scott.
SPIKE: You daft prick!
BELLA: This painting isn't the original, is it?
WILLIAM: Yes, I think that one may be.

WILLIAM: Yes -- sort of...
BERNIE: That's nice.
WILLIAM: What?
BERNIE: Well, you know, anybody saying they want to go out with you is... pretty great... isn't it...
WILLIAM: It was sort of sweet actually -- I mean, I know she's an actress and all that, so she can deliver a line -- but she said that she might be as famous as can be -- but also... that she was just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her.
