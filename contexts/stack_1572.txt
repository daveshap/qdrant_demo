adjustable trapezoidal waveform I would like to buid a trapezoidal (waveform) with the following specs :rise time : 10nsVTop : 1VtTop: 40nsfall time: 15nsLinearity is importantFrequency max : 10kHz Load is has a very high impedance (Op amp input)I was planning to make a sawtooth first and then clip off the tops. (diodes to have different rise and fall times)But  I would like to make the rise and fall time adjustable.so, I would appreciate if someone could help me to find a more elegant and simple approach?
