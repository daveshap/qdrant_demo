BOB: Did you do this?
DAVID: Yes I did.
BOB: Do you know that it's illegal?
DAVID: Yes I do.
BOB: BUD--WHY DID YOU DO THIS?
DAVID: Because anybody should be able to paint in whatever color they want.
BOB: You're not allowed to do this! I could arrest you for this.
DAVID: Still doesn't make it right.
BOB: Dan! Arrest them!
DAN: Um ... I don't know how to do that, Bob.
BOB: What do you mean!?
DAN: Well, I never had to do it before.
BOB: You put handcuffs on them and you take them to the police station.
DAN: Oh. guess I could do that, then.
