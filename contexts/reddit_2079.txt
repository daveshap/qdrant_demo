How it feels to be mediocre
I’m not really sure how to word this, but does anyone else get this overwhelming sense of being so mediocre at everything?

Like you have interests and ambitions, you have good grades, but at the same time you’re not special at all. There’s nothing that makes you stand out from any other ordinary applicant. It’s like you can’t see why any college would ever want to accept you.   

Lately I’ve been feeling this way a lot, and I feel like I won’t even get in anywhere; which is also why I can’t seem to start my applications. Thanks for sticking around if you read all of this, just needed to get it out.
