Interesting in master's in student affairs but hear the field is saturated. Are there any areas that are in need of entry-level professionals and aren't saturated? Any areas to avoid?
I currently work at a university but in a marketing role, and I think I want to transition out of public relations, but I like the university environment. If I quit to pursue the full\-time student affairs degree here, though, I'd need a job on the other end obviously, and I hear the field has become saturated.

I'm more interested in advising and supporting students academically or figuring out their "calling," and not at all interested in res life or entertainment programming.
