SUE: I'm so sorry, man. You were so right. I got rid of the gun
MIKE: What are they doing here?
SUE: We ran into them that night at Roscoe's. Tee cleared it up, I apologized, bought them some chicken and waffles. They fuckin love Tee. That boy can talk.
SUE: But most important, man, I'm sorry about what I said. I was drunk... My adrenaline was going...
MIKE: Don't sweat it, man. I needed a kick in the ass. We're better friends for it.
SUE: Thanks, man. I've been hating myself for the last two days.
MIKE: Believe me, I know what that's like. Yo, Double Down! What time are we leaving?
