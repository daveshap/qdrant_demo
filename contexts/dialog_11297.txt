VARIO: I'm not going to get fucked like Gribbs. He's seventy years old and the fucking guy is going to die in prison. I don't need that. I don't care who it is. I'm warning everybody. Gribbs got twenty years just because he said hello to some fuck who was sneaking around selling junk behind his back. That's not going to happen to me. You understand?
HENRY: Paulie. Why would I? I swear.
VARIO: You're only home early because we got you a job, right? And I don't need any heat. You understand?
HENRY: Nods.
VARIO: And, if you hear about anybody else fucking around with that shit, you tell me.
HENRY: Nods again.
VARIO: Anybody! You understand?
HENRY: I understand.
