LENNY: So, let's see, I've got Tran's goons, some squidhead psycho and the LAPD all trying to kill me. Happy new year, Lenny.
MACE: Well, look at the plus side.
LENNY: There's a plus side?
MACE: Yeah. You gave up your hot tub tape to save me. That's real progress for you.
LENNY: It was a tough call.
MACE: I still can't square the psycho smarts of whoever did Iris with those two cops.
LENNY: I don't think those cops did Iris. I think whoever Iris was wearing for killed her.
MACE: Why?
LENNY: To break the trail. If those cops had gotten hold of her, they would have beat it out of her who she was wearing for, and then gone after them too. Our killer is running as scared as we are. Which makes him really dangerous. Judging by how scared I am.
MAX: Sounds like Tick's already celebrating.
LENNY: You may be a little overdressed for this party. Yo, Tick! It's Lenny. Open up!
