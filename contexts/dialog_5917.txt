GITTES: ...the coroner's report showed Mulwray had salt water in his lungs.
CROSS: Hollie was always fond of tide-pools. You know what he used to say about them?
GITTES: Haven't the faintest idea.
CROSS: That's where life begins... marshes, sloughs, tide-pools... he was fascinated by them... you know when we first came out here he figured that if you dumped water onto desert sand it would percolate down into the bedrock and stay there, instead of evaporating the way it does in most reservoirs. You'd lose only twenty percent instead of seventy or eighty. He made this city.
GITTES: And that's what you were going to do in the Valley?
CROSS: No, Mr. Gittes. That's what I am doing with the Valley. The bond issue passes Tuesday. There'll be ten million to build an aqueduct and reservoir. I'm doing it.
GITTES: There's going to be some irate citizens when they find out they're paying for water they're not getting.
CROSS: That's all taken care of. You see, Mr. Gittes. Either you bring the water to L.A. or you bring L.A. to the water.
GITTES: How do you do that?
CROSS: Just incorporate the Valley into the city so the water goes to L.A. after all. It's very simple.
GITTES: How much are you worth?
CROSS: I have no idea. How much do you want?
GITTES: I want to know what you're worth. Over ten million?
CROSS: Oh, my, yes.
GITTES: Then why are you doing it? How much better can you eat? What can you buy that you can't already afford?
CROSS: The future, Mr. Gittes. The future. Now where's the girl?... I want the only daughter I have left... as you found out, Evelyn was lost to me a long time ago.
GITTES: Who do you blame for that? Her?
