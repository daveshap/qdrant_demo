revenge
when i was 18, a senior in highschool, my art teacher (jennifer havrey) told me “youre going to grow up and do nothing with your life”  i already have very low self esteem, and this killed me. it took everything i had to not cry in front of the entire class. i just played it cool. “ok whatever” and continued to put my head down like i didnt care. im 20 now and not a single day goes by when i dont replay this scene or repeat her words in my head. this has effected me more than anything else in my life. its only fair i effect her the same way she has effected me. every night i go to bed and i fantasize and think about how i can effect her psycologically the same way she did to me. ive been studying psychosis and mental illness and what causes these things and will continue studying until i can prove to her that i “did something with my life” and can show her not only did i do something with my life but also how a simple sentence can effect someone so deeply and emotionally. and she will experience the same pain that i experience everyday. she will understand whats its like to hate yourself. she will understand what its like to have people constantly laugh at your dreams. she will understand suicidal tendencies. its the wrong thing to do but you have no idea what ive been through, you have no idea how this has effected me. it will be done. jennifer will feel just as bad, if not worse than i feel about myself. (i will not lay a finger on her, or even see her in person, she will not be physically touched) give me 7 years.
