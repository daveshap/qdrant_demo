Error in change of projection from Lat/Long to UTM Why does the the DEM when converted to UTM Zone 43N system give all values as 0 in QGIS? I followed the standard procedure of saving the parent layer and then assigning the CRS. When I open the same in ENVI, after editing the header and reassigning the projection of the parent layer, I can see that the units are in metres, but the same when opened in QGIS renders geographic lat/lon system.
