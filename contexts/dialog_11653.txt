MARTIN: Are you going to the reunion?
DEBI: No. I'm not going. Is that why you're here?
MARTIN: That's part of it.
DEBI: Well, you'll have a ball. You seem to have everything everybody wants when they go back. The car, the suit, the watch. The look. That just leaves the little things, like happiness, character, point of view...
MARTIN: It's always the little things.
DEBI: Yep.
