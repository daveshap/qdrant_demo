FRANK: Come on, come on!
BOB: Hurry up!
LONGFELLOW: Feel better now?
BABE: Mmm, it tastes so good. Mr. Deeds, I don't know how I can ever thank you.
LONGFELLOW: Tell me more about yourself.
BABE: Well, I guess I've told you almost everything there is to tell. My folks live in a small town near Hartford. I'm down here alone trying to make a living. Oh, I'm really just a nobody.
BABE: Oh, that was so lovely. Thank you.
LONGFELLOW: You were a lady in distress, weren't you?
BABE: What?
LONGFELLOW: Oh - uh - nothing.
