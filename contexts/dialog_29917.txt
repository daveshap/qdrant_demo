BLIND MAN: Hey! You there!
JOHN: You want something, old man?
BLIND MAN: Don't call me old man. Ain't you got no respect, boy?
JOHN: You want something?
BLIND MAN: Yeah I want something. I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.
JOHN: You can't do that yourself?
BLIND MAN: Hell no, I can't do that myself. I'm blind. Can't you see that?
JOHN: I'm sorry, I didn't--
BLIND MAN: What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on? Sunnin' myself?
JOHN: I don't know. I thought you were keeping the sun from your eyes.
BLIND MAN: I ain't got no eyes. You want to see?
JOHN: Christ no!
BLIND MAN: Lost my eyes on Okinawa. Lost them fighting the war. Fought the war and lost my eyes just so you could come around here and make fun of me.
JOHN: I said I was sorry.
BLIND MAN: Don't be sorry. Just run over there and get me my pop before I die of thirst.
JOHN: Yeah, sure. You got change?
BLIND MAN: Change? You want my change? I fought the war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change?
JOHN: All right, old man. Christ.
BLIND MAN: Get me a Dr. Peppa! I don't want no Pepsi. Pepsi ain't nothing but flavored water.
JOHN: Yeah, yeah.
BLIND MAN: Don't forget to open it for me. I can't be opening my own bottle.
JOHN: Christ!
