DIFFORD: If this is a joke, I'm not laughing.
ALEX: Neither are we. Something's wrong with the game, Mr. Difford.
DIFFORD: Why don't we take this into my office.
DIFFORD: Talk to me.
ALEX: There's something wrong with ARCADE. The game's alive somehow...
NICK: What Alex is trying to say is that it seems" like it's alive."
ALEX: No I'm not...
NICK: We're not getting very far into the levels and we kind of thought maybe we could talk to a programmer, learn some tricks and stuff... I mean, you don't want us kids running around school saying your game's too hard, right?
