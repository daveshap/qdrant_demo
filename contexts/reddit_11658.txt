Have I even been to a “party”?
Currently a college sophomore. In high school, I would hangout with like 5 or 6 friends overnight, weed and alcohol included. That happened around 5 or 6 times. In college, I’ve been to a couple “parties”(I’m not sure???) that includes at most 13 people. So I honestly don’t know if I’ve ever actually been to a “party” and that makes me feel like shit, as a 20 year old.
