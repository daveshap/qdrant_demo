BILLY: Yeah, sure. Look what happened to them.
JOE: No, no, no, I told you. They're fine. They're all real happy.
BILLY: My next delivery is up that way, so I'll be getting down to it real soon.
JOE: You're so easy.
BILLY: Gotta keep an eye on her, that's all.
JOE: Yeah, what for?
BILLY: Keep her from gettin' in trouble, that's all.
JOE: What's the matter now?
BILLY: Nothing... I don't like being out in the open like this.
JOE: It must be just so pathetic being you. Sure Billy, grab your dog we'll eat in the van.
LANEY: Not here...no thanks.
JOE: Not a coke or anything?
LANEY: No ... thanks though... I'll take a cigarette if you have one.
JOE: Sure, reach in my shirt pocket there.
LANEY: No. I haven't seen any.
JOE: A brunette? ... maybe beat up?
LANEY: No...
JOE: You'll keep your eyes open for me won't you baby?
LANEY: Sure.
