Man up and stop being so scared
I'm so exhausted from dating and talking to men to see where it will go. It feels like my entire year has been spent on meeting men who are scared or think they're not good enough or intimidated by me or scared to be vulnerable. I'm so exhausted by all of this. 

Stop judging a book by its cover. Just cus a girl has her shit together and is presentable and attractive doesn't mean you're not worthy or she'll break your heart. Stop being afraid to go for it and give it a chance. Stop being so scared to open your heart.

People think being attractive makes it easier to date and they are wrong. I'm nothing special but sure you can classify me as "attractive" and smart and somehow this intimidates some men. Great.

All I want is to find love. Real love with someone  that means something. Why is that so hard?? Sigh. :(

EDIT: This definitely brought out quite a lot of emotions in some. I get it, maybe it sounded sexist and that I'm trying to blame men for everything. It's not that. I know it's not always cus Im intimidating. A situation happened this week and this was brought up that got me frustrated. Do I think all men are as I described above? No. Im just another girl who genuinely wants to find something meaningful and was a bit frustrated today. All the best to all of you!
