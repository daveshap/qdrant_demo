Does anyone every feel like not being alive, but you don’t want to die?
It was a rough holiday season and I’m in a really bad patch. I’ve battle suicidal thoughts before and have managed to pull through. So I know I’m not suicidal right now, (if that makes any sense). But right now I don’t want to be alive but I don’t want to die, I just want to disappear for a little bit and be left alone. Does anyone else feel that way?
