High school drama
Ok so this is gonna be some high school drama bullshit so if you don’t like that just keep going but I would appreciate some help. 

My best friend got in his first serious relationship and I do not like the girl. She has talked lots of crap about me in the past and told everyone that she would take my best friend away from me. Even with that I tried to be nice.... she denied me every single time. Later I decided to have a Christmas party and since she hadn’t been talking to me I didn’t invite her, I even asked my best fiend if that’s okay and he said it’s fine. She got pissed and decided to throw a party the same day. I apologized many times and I decided to cancel my party for her. I was close to a lot of her friends but I never told them how I felt because I didn’t want to ruin their friendship. Later we all found out that she has been talking crap about all of us and she ditched her other friends so they are kinda on my side. We recently we went on a trip for school and we decided not to talk to there group because she gets very jealous when girls talk to my best friend and we didn’t want to deal with the shit talking. They blamed us and started telling people that we were talking shit about them. 

My best friend doesn’t know any of this is happening. I want to tell him but I believe he will just think I’m making shit up because I don’t like her. 

Any advice to stop this ? 

Thank you
