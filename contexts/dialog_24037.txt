MOTHER SUPERIOR: Miss Van Cartier.
CHRISTY: What?
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Your cigarette -- out.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: It has come to pass.
CHRISTY: What?
MOTHER SUPERIOR: I joined this convent some thirty years ago. At that time, the world knew some measure of peace. And hope. Our order was a beacon of hospitality, to families, to children, to a neighborhood filled with promise. And, as the years have passed, I have watched that promise destroyed. Drugs. Gangs. Spandex. And. so I have made this convent an oasis, a retreat from horror. And now that horror has invaded these sacred walls.
CHRISTY: Are you talking about me?
MOTHER SUPERIOR: And all those like you.
CHRISTY: You mean black people?
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Absolutely not. I mean the wicked. The heedless. And their Las Vegas concubines.
CHRISTY: What's a concubine?
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Check your driver's license.
CHRISTY: Fine. Got it. Look, the way I see it, I'm stuck here, right? I mean, I'm here or I'm target practice. So here's the deal -- I don't bug you, you don't bug me. I'll catch up on some sleep, watch some tube, lay back and lay low. So just get me a key and show me to my room, and do not disturb. Capisce?
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Of course. But it's almost lunch.
CHRISTY: Cool. Is there a menu? Or buffet?
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Before we do, you might like to freshen up. And you'll certainly want to change
CHRISTY: Deal.
CHRISTY: How about a robe? One of those big terry cloth jobs, with like embroidery on the pocket. Guest of St. Katherine's""
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Would you like that?
