How to deal with different likelihood of censoring across groups in survival analysis? I am analysing survival data for nematode worms fed on four different bacterial diets (four groups). Each group has at least 70 events (deaths), but there is often a very uneven proportion of censoring between groups - for example, one group has 30% censored data points, whereas another has only 5%. The standard statistical procedure is the use of the log rank test on Kaplan-Meier survival curves (followed by pairwise multiple comparison in my case). However, am I correct in thinking that differences in the likelihood of censoring between groups violates one of the assumptions of the log rank test? If so, I would appreciate some advice as to how should I proceed with statistical analysis.
