ERNEST: Francie, you know I can't do that.
FRANCES: Why? It's such a simple thing. You just let me out and I disappear down a road and you never have to see me again.
ERNEST: They'll just catch you again, Francie. Besides, your mother will know.
FRANCES: Dad, here! You don't have to stop, just slow down. You can tell Mama I jumped out. She knows that's the kind of thing I'd do. She won't blame you.
ERNEST: But I gave her my word. Besides, she's still your legal guardian. My hands are tied.
FRANCES: You know where you're taking me. You know what she'll do. Just give me a minute, slow down, give me an instant for once in your life, please?
ERNEST: Please, Francie...
FRANCES: Daddy!
