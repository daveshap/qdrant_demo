CLAUDIA: --- yeah, yeah, I get in it in my ear. It's TMJ is what it's called technically.
JIM KURRING: What's that stand for?
CLAUDIA: Tempural-something-mandibular, thing with something, I dunno. But it affects my ear, I don't even know if I have TMJ exactly but just very tight, like - it's like a muscle spasm and it's just gets so clenched --
JIM KURRING: This is my job.
CLAUDIA: We were just gettin' warmed up. We were just getting started.
JIM KURRING: Well if you listen' to that music too loud again and that fella returns maybe we'll share another cup of coffee --
CLAUDIA: If you're not here for a 422 --
JIM KURRING: No. No. Don't joke about that. That's not funny, Claudia. Please, now.
CLAUDIA: I'm sorry.
JIM KURRING: Ok, then. Keep your chin up and your music down, alright?
CLAUDIA: Yes. I will. It was nice to meet you Officer Jim.
JIM KURRING: Just Jim.
CLAUDIA: yeah, good, ok.
JIM KURRING: Bye, bye, Claudia.
CLAUDIA: Good bye.
JIM KURRING: I'm sorry, Claudia.
CLAUDIA: What is it? Did you forget something?
JIM KURRING: No, no. I was wondering...man oh man. I think I feel like a bit of a scum-bucket doing this, considering that I came here as an officer of the law and the situation and all this but I think I'd be a fool if I didn't do something I really want to do which is to ask you on a date.
CLAUDIA: You wanna go on a date with me?
JIM KURRING: Please, yes.
CLAUDIA: Well...is that illegal?
JIM KURRING: No.
CLAUDIA: Then...I'd like to go...What do you want to do?
JIM KURRING: I don't know. I haven't thought about it -- you know what -- that's not true -- I have thought about it. I've thought about going on a date with you since you opened the door.
CLAUDIA: Really?
JIM KURRING: Yeah.
CLAUDIA: I thought you were flirting with me a little.
CLAUDIA: Do you wanna go tonight? I mean, are you working?
JIM KURRING: No, I'm off tonight. I would lov-like, to go tonight, I can pick you up, I can pick you up here at about what time? What time?
CLAUDIA: Eight o'clock?
JIM KURRING: What about ten o'clock, is that too late? I don't get off and then --
CLAUDIA: Oh sure yes, that's fine, late dinners are good. Should I get dressed up or -- ?
JIM KURRING: No, no, just casual maybe, maybe I thought -- there's a spot I like to go, it's real nice that overlooks a golf course and the course is lit up at night --
CLAUDIA: Billingsley's?
JIM KURRING: Yeah, You know it? You know Billingsley's?
CLAUDIA: It's my favorite place --
JIM KURRING: Oh, see? This is great. Ten o'clock.
CLAUDIA: Great, bye.
JIM KURRING: Bye.
