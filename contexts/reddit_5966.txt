Biology majors
Hello everyone!

Not sure if I'm in the right place for this question but I'm going to ask it anyways.

So, I'm in my mid twenties and wanting to give college another go. I was enrolled in IT a few years back and just didn't enjoy the field as much as I thought I would even though the job market for it is booming right now. So I took a few years off to decide what I wanna do. I've came to the conclusion that I would really love to do something in the science field. 

My community college recently switched their Biology major from a transfer degree to a BS. I was considering enrolling next semester but I'm curious as to what the job opportunities are looking like at this moment. Also, how difficult is it to get your foot in the door with just an associates?

My goal would be to work at a wildlife/habitat conservation center or maybe in my state's department of natural resources. Obviously I wont turn down any good paying job in a science related field though.

So, I'm curious as to how difficult it was for you guys to land a decent job after getting your degree and what kind of job were you able to get to put a foot in the door?

Thank you!
