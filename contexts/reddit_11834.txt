Class started 3 weeks ago and I haven't went yet
I know I'm not too far behind to catch up, but I will be in a day or two. This depression is killing me. I started going to a counselor and a psychiatrist, and got prescribed stuff to help, but it isn't going to fix all the classes I withdrew from and all the bridges I burned. 

To top it off, I'm rushing a sorority, and during our personal interviews today, I saw the lady writing a note on her paper that said: 'lip issue'. She was referring to my almost completely healed cold sore that I've spent an awful week trying to get over. People tell me that "No one pays attention to cold sores." When you combine that with the reason someone broke up with me recently, my once high self esteem is in shambles. Getting broken up with for being "not phsycially attractive" is absolutely terrible. It still effects me and I'm doing everything I can to get over it. 

I'm just so stressed. I wanted to rant and vent. Thanks for being here, /r/whatsbotheringyou.
