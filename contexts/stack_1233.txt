Looking for a query that eliminates near-repeats I have a database with four rows: county_a, county_b, flow_a_to_b, and flow_b_to_a. Essentially, the data is repeating in other rows, but the values are switched around. Here's an example:Entry 1: Baltimore County, Baltimore City, 10, 1Entry 2: Baltimore City, Baltimore County, 1, 10These entries are technically different but they give me the same information. What kind of query could I write to eliminate the second value while keeping the first?
