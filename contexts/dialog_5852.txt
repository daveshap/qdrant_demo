GITTES: What's that, pal?
OTHER CUSTOMER: Nothing. You got a hell of a way to make a living.
GITTES: Oh? What do you do to make ends meet?
OTHER CUSTOMER: Mortgage Department, First National Bank.
GITTES: Tell me, how many people a week do you foreclose on?
OTHER CUSTOMER: We don't publish a record in the paper, I can tell you that.
GITTES: Neither do I.
OTHER CUSTOMER: No, you have a press agent do it.
GITTES: Barney, who is this bimbo? He a regular customer?
BARNEY: Take it easy, Jake.
GITTES: Look, pal. I make an honest living. People don't come to me unless they're miserable and I help 'em out of a bad situation. I don't kick them out of their homes like you jerks who work in the bank.
BARNEY: Jake, for Christ's sake.
