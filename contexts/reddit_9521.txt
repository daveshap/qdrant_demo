Does anyone else find it ridiculous being forced to buy your own uniform for a minimum wage job?
I work as a sales associate at a sporting goods store where we are required to wear a dress shirt, slacks and up until recently we had to wear leather shoes.  I work in the stockroom a lot so slacks wear out incredibly fast. I switched to canvas pants that still look professional but have been barred from wearing them due to the pocket stitching showing. I was told not to return to work without slacks. I find it ridiculous that we’re forced to wear dress shirts and slacks to a minimum wage job, at a low end retailer no less.  It quickly gets expensive!  I guess I’ll be throwing a $35 pair of pants....
