I feel unqualified for nearly everything
I'm 29 and I have never had a job that didn't just take anybody. My first job was selling knives with CutCo. I can usually make myself distinct after getting the job. When I worked for Mathnasium I became the Floor Manager, when I worked as a substitute teacher I was well liked and was invited to numerous long-term assignments (where I learned teaching wasn't for me). 

I got a degree in Psychology, which you can't really do anything with without a Masters and I can't go back to school for another degree because it is just too expensive. I'm fairly wishy-washy anyway when it comes to what I want to do so I can't go back to school in good faith anyway. 

I mean, I'm fine spending a couple hundred for an online class but how do I know what business will accept? "I don't have a degree in programming but I did take an online class on Coursera" doesn't seem like it would fly.

I'm not secure enough I can do an unpaid internship. Sorry if this is turning into a rant. I just feel like I'm not on any path that leads to a career and financial security and that I'm quickly getting too old to start that path. Any advice on how to build up qualifications or entry level jobs that provide training on the job?
