SARAH: He'll find us, won't he?
REESE: Probably. Sarah, if I get zeroed...
SARAH: Don't say that.
REESE: If I do, you have to get away, disappear without a trace. Different country, different name, everything. In case they send another one.
SARAH: It'll never be over, will it? Look at me, I'm shaking. Some legend, huh? You must be pretty disappointed.
REESE: No. I'm not.
SARAH: Kyle, the women in your time...what were they like?
REESE: Good fighters.
SARAH: That's not what I meant. Was there someone special?
REESE: Someone?
SARAH: A girl. You know.
REESE: No. Never.
