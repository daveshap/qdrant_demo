KATE: Look, we don’t have time for this right now, we’ll talk about it later. Now get dressed... You’re not wearing that to the Thompsons’ party. I don’t care how hilarious you think it is...
JACK: Party? Oh no, I can’t go to a party...
KATE: You look forward to this party all year. What’s with you today?
JACK: Trust me on this Kate. I really don’t think going to a party is the right move for me at the present time.
