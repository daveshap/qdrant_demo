GRAY: Come, Toddy -- come. Sit down here with me.
MACFARLANE: Don't call me that confounded name.
GRAY: Well, then, Doctor MacFarlane -- although I've known a time, Toddy, when you liked the name. Aye, and many are dead now who called you by it; rough and wild ones they were, too. But come Toddy, sit down here with your young friend.
MACFARLANE: Mr. Fettes and I have professional matters to discuss.
GRAY: Medicine? That'll keep. Sit down.
