NEO: Hello?
ORACLE: I know. You're Neo. Be right with you.
NEO: You're the Oracle?
ORACLE: Bingo. Not quite what you were expecting, right? I got to say I love seeing you non-believers. Always a pip. Almost done. Smell good, don't they?
NEO: Yeah.
ORACLE: I'd ask you to sit down, but you're not going to anyway. And don't worry about the vase.
NEO: What vase?
ORACLE: That vase.
NEO: Shit, I'm sorry.
ORACLE: I said don't worry about it. I'll get one of my kids to fix it.
NEO: How did you know...?
