MIGUELITO: I've even printed my own currency.
JIM: Emperor Miguelito...?""
MIGUELITO: The first.
JIM: Well, your highness, what makes you think we'll ever sign a treaty with you?
MIGUELITO: Because I am holding all the western territories hostage, Mr. West! A town a day will disappear! Willard was merely a test run, a stroll in the park. Next, I level all of Albuquerque! Yes, that's right. Only yesterday I learned what you undoubtedly already know: your own President will be there. What an added bonus! The gods are shining on me! After tomorrow every American citizen will rise up and demand I be given back my humble little empire!
JIM: So, I'm the only one here who can tell the difference between an Emperor and a murderer?
