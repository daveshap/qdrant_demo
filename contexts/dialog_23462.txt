ANN: I don't see what difference it makes, I mean, I can think what I want. I don't know if I want to do this anymore, I'm afraid... I don't mind answering the questions so much, but if somebody were to see this...
GRAHAM: At some level, I don't understand your nervousness. Have you decided to leave John?
ANN: Yes, I have. I will.
GRAHAM: Then as far as this taping goes, you have nothing to worry about.
ANN: I guess not.
GRAHAM: Do you want me to stop?
ANN: No.
GRAHAM: Are there people other than your previous lover that you have fantasized about?
ANN: Yes. Whenever... all right, look. Whenever I see a man that I think is attractive, I wonder what it would be like with him, I mean, I'm just curious, I don't act on it, but I hate that I think that!! I wish I could just forget about that stuff!!
GRAHAM: Why?
ANN: Because that's how Cynthia thinks!! All she does is think about that stuff, and I hate that, I don't want to be like her, I don't want to be like her!!
GRAHAM: You're not like your sister. You couldn't be like her if you wanted to.
ANN: I know. Deep down, I know that. It just bothers me, when I have feelings or impulses that she has.
GRAHAM: So you do fantasize?
ANN: Yes.
GRAHAM: About who?
ANN: I fantasized about you.
GRAHAM: About me?
ANN: Yes.
ANN: Have you fantasized about me?
GRAHAM: I thought I made that clear before, when I said I would go down on you.
ANN: I remember. You could do that, couldn't you? Go down on me?
GRAHAM: Yes.
ANN: If I asked you to, would you? Not on tape, I mean?
GRAHAM: No.
ANN: On tape?
GRAHAM: No.
ANN: Why not?
GRAHAM: If I can't do it all, I don't want to do anything. And I can't do it all.
ANN: Can't or won't?
GRAHAM: Can't.
ANN: You said you weren't always impotent.
GRAHAM: That's correct.
ANN: So you have had sex.
GRAHAM: Yes.
ANN: Who was the last person you had sex with?
GRAHAM: Her name was Elizabeth.
ANN: So what happened? Was it so bad that it turned you off?
GRAHAM: No, it was wonderful. That wasn't the problem.
ANN: What was the problem?
GRAHAM: The problem was me. I was... I was a pathological liar. Or am, I should say. Lying is like alcoholism, one is always recovering"."
ANN: So you lied to her?
GRAHAM: Yes. I did. Willfully and repeatedly.
ANN: How come?
GRAHAM: I loved her for how good she made me feel, and I hated her for how good she made me feel. And at that time, I tended to express my feelings non- verbally. I couldn't handle anyone having that much control over my emotions.
ANN: And now you can?
GRAHAM: Now I make sure that no one has the opportunity to test me.
ANN: Don't you get lonely?
GRAHAM: How could I, with all these nice people stopping by? The fact is that I've lived by myself for so long, I can't imagine living with another person. It's amazing what you can get used to if enough time goes by. And anyway, I'm asking the questions. Are you happy?
ANN: I don't know anymore. I thought I was, but obviously I was wrong.
GRAHAM: Did you confront John with the fact that you knew about him?
ANN: Not yet. I'm not sure I will. I just want out.
GRAHAM: If you do get out of your marriage, will you continue to be inhibited?
ANN: I don't know. It all gets back to that Cynthia thing. I don't like her... eagerness. There's nothing left to imagine, there's no...
GRAHAM: Subtlety?
ANN: Subtlety, yes. No subtlety. Plus, I've never really felt able to open up with anyone. I mean, that other person I told you about, I enjoyed making love with him a lot, but I still wasn't able to really let go. I always feel like I'm being watched and I shouldn't embarrass myself.
GRAHAM: And you feel the same way with John?
ANN: Kind of. I mean, John's like this kind of... craftsman. Like he's a carpenter, and he makes really good tables. But that's all he can make, and I don't need anymore tables.
GRAHAM: Interesting analogy.
ANN: I'm babbling.
GRAHAM: No, you're not.
ANN: God, I m so mad at him!!
GRAHAM: You should be. He lied to you. So did Cynthia.
ANN: Yeah, I know, but somehow I expect that from her, I mean, she'll do it with almost anybody, I don't know, I shouldn't stick up for her I guess, but him. He lied so... deeply!! Ooo, I want to watch him die!!
ANN: You're really never going to make love again?
GRAHAM: I'm not planning on it.
ANN: If you were in love with me, would you?
GRAHAM: I'm not in love with you.
ANN: But if you were?
GRAHAM: I... I can't answer that precisely.
ANN: But I feel like maybe I could be really comfortable with you.
GRAHAM: That's very flattering.
ANN: So why won't you make love with me? Why wouldn't you, I mean?
GRAHAM: Ann. Are you asking me hypothetically, or are you asking me for real, right now?
ANN: I'm asking for real. I want you to turn that camera off and make love with me. Will you?
GRAHAM: I can't.
ANN: Why not?
GRAHAM: I've told you.
ANN: But I don't understand --
GRAHAM: Ann, it could happen to me all over again, don't you see? I could start to --
ANN: But how do you know for sure, you have to try to find a way to fig --
GRAHAM: I couldn't face her if I had slept with somebody else.
ANN: Who? Elizabeth?
GRAHAM: Yes.
ANN: You mean you're still in contact with her?
GRAHAM: No.
ANN: But you're planning to be?
GRAHAM: I don't know. Possibly.
ANN: Wait a minute, wait a minute. What's going on here? Did you come back here just to see her again?
GRAHAM: Not entirely.
ANN: But that was part of it?
GRAHAM: Yes.
ANN: Like maybe a big part?
GRAHAM: Possibly.
ANN: Graham, I mean, what do you think her reaction is going to be if you contact her?
GRAHAM: I don't know.
ANN: Look at you, look at what's happened to you, look how you've changed! Don't you think she will have changed?
GRAHAM: I don't know. I really would rather not talk about it.
ANN: Whoa!! I'm so glad we got that on tape!! You won't answer a question about Elizabeth, but I have to answer all these intimate questions about my sex life!! Graham, what do you think she's going to make of all these videotapes? Are you going to tell her about them? I can't imagine her being too understanding about that. But since you don't lie anymore, you'll have to say something.
GRAHAM: As I said, I haven't decided what to do, exactly. Perhaps I won't do anything.
ANN: Oh, you just moved here to think about it, right?
