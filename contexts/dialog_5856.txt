GITTES: There's seven ashtrays in this room, Duffy.
DUFFY: Okay.
GITTES: That's a filthy habit.
DUFFY: I said okay, Jake.
GITTES: Yeah, yeah. If she'd come in here saying she was Shirley Temple you'd say okay to that, too.
WALSH: Look, Jake. She gave us Mulwray's real phone number and address.
GITTES: All she needed for that was the phone book!
WALSH: No, no. She said not to call, her husband might answer.
GITTES: When I find out who that phony bitch was.
GITTES: Sophie.
SOPHIE: Yes, Mr. Gittes.
GITTES: Get me the Times. Whitey Mehrholtz. And how about that snotty broad? What does she think, she's perfect? Coming in waving her lawyers and her money at me â€“ so goddam smug. She's no better than anybody else in this town.
