Recruiter contacted me for a position I don't remember applying for, and they aren't listed on Indeed. Scam?
This morning I got a text message from a recruiter asking if I was still interested in a business assistant position. They told me they got my application on Indeed, but I don't remember submitting one, and when I looked their company up on Indeed, they weren't listed to begin with. We've been going back and forth over text about what the job entailed and where they are located. When I look them up, they are across the country. This recruiter (possibly the CEO) told me that this is a work from home job in which I would be setting up schedules, flights, and assisting in payroll. When I looked up their company online, I don't see an office, but an apartment building. They don't even have a website. I need a job, but this just doesn't seem legitimate to me.

Edit: I just rescinded my application, thank you all for knocking some sense into me.
