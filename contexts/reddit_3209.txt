Started a new job 5 months ago and want to work from home, how do I approach my boss?
I got hired at a position that is very niche and they were taking candidates as either in person or telecommute. Itâ€™s a very work from home friendly environment. Instead of bargaining for more money, I bargained to work from home. The recruiter talked with my boss who told her that I can work from home after a year (did not get this in writing)

My boss is retiring this summer and I want to solidify working from home 3 days a week. Not full time bc I would go nuts but it would save me a huge commute (can be an hour each way)

I have a review on Monday, should I broach the subject then? If so, how should I approach it? I really like the job but want to wfh more often. Thanks for advice
