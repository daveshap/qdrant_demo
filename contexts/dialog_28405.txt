GONDORFF: Take it easy, you won't lose him now. We had him 10 years ago when he decided to be somebody. Believe me, I've seen enough to know.
HOOKER: How many guys you conned in your life, Henry?
GONDORFF: Two or three hundred I guess. Sometimes played two a day when I was in Shea's mob. We had it down to a business. 'Course Chicago was a right town then. The fix was in. The dicks took their end without a beef. All the Wall Street boys wanted to make investments for us. Even had marks looking us up, thinkin' they could beat the game. Yeh, kid, it really stunk. No sense in bein' a grifter if it's the same as bein' a citizen.
GONDORFF: I better do some packin'. I'm gonna be a hot number again after tomorrow.
HOOKER: Then why you doin' it?
GONDORFF: Seems worthwhile, doesn't it? Maybe it's just for the cave-in on Lonnegan's face when we put in the sting.
HOOKER: Henry.
HOOKER: Yeh.
HOOKER: I appreciate your stickin' your neck out. I wouldn't have asked ya if it weren't for Luther.
GONDORFF: Ain't nothin' gonna make up for Luther, kid. Revenge is for suckers. I been griftin' 30 years and never got any.
LORETTA: Looks like he missed ya.
HOOKER: Yeh, this time anyway.
