Huge victory! I just paid off a student loan!
Tl:Dr I just finished paying off my highest interest rate student loan! 

So a bit of back story. I graduated from an art school 6 years ago with over $71k in student loan debt. Since then I have almost always worked multiple jobs earning an income between $25k-$42k per year. There were many many months were ends didn't meet but I've always made it a priority to make my student loan payments. I've lived on my own this whole time and haven't had financial support from family. I've just lived as frugally as possible and worked as much as I could stand. This past year I've started freelancing graphic design and it really helped paying off the last of a $10k 7.8% Sallie mae loan I had. I'm just really happy! This will free up about $120/month for me.
