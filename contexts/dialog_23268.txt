BRAD: They got to stop <U>sometime</U>...if they're human at all, they got to stop!
ETHAN: Naw...a human man rides a horse till it dies...then he goes on afoot...A Comanche comes along...gets that horse up...and rides it twenty more miles...Then he eats it.
ETHAN: Easy on that!
MARTIN: Sorry...We don't even know if Debbie 'n Lucy are with this bunch...Maybe they split up...
ETHAN: They're with 'em -- if they're still alive.
BRAD: You've said that enough!...Maybe Lucy's dead...maybe they're both dead...but if I hear it from you again, I'll fight ya, Mr. Edwards!
ETHAN: That'll be the day!...Let's ride.
