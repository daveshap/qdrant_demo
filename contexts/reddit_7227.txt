Hotel sharing norms?
I am going to an expenses-paid seminar in another city for a few days this summer. I have the option to share a hotel room with another attendee, or pay the difference to have my own room.  


I would prefer to share a room and save that cash, but my only question is about what companies usually consider when placing roommates together. I only want to be placed with someone the same sex as me, for no reason other than that is what I'd feel more comfortable with. Is that something most companies would do by default or should I request that specifically?  


If anyone else has any additional insight on hotel sharing etiquette and expectations, please feel free to share! This is completely new territory to me.
