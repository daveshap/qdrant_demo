VENKMAN: Ray -- Something's here.
STANTZ: Where are you, Pete?
VENKMAN: Third floor. Get down here,
STANTZ: Sit tight. I'm on my way.
VENKMAN: Well, hurry up. The needle's going wild.
VENKMAN: It's here, Ray. It's looking at me.
STANTZ: Don't move. It won't hurt you.
VENKMAN: How do you know?
STANTZ: I don't know. I'm just guessing.
