BUZZ: What makes you so sure it was me? She coulda had lotsa bowlers! Theo rushes Buzz and grabs his arm. The two men struggle for the pin.
THEO: Don't say that about my mom!
BUZZ: I had a career. She wanted a little bowler of her own. Sid and Breeze leap into the fray, prying the two men apart. They wrestle Theo against a wall, pressing his face into the tiles.
THEO: Fuck you and fuck bowling.
BUZZ: That's a laugh. You're all strung out. You're a bowling junkie.
THEO: I don't need the stinking pro-tour.
BUZZ: You're dead without the pro-tour, and you know it. Get him away from me. Sid and Breeze punch Theo in the face.
