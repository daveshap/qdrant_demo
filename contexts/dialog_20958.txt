CORNELIUS: As you wish.
TAYLOR: Zaius seems to think there might be another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone. That's what we'll try for. What about you?
ZIRA: Cornelius and I have been indicted for heresy. Unless we can prove our theories, we don't stand a chance of acquittal.
TAYLOR: You're going back to the Forbidden Zone?
CORNELIUS: To the diggings I worked at a year ago. It's a three day ride across the eastern desert, near where you claim you landed from that planet of yours.
TAYLOR: You still don't believe me, do you?
CORNELIUS: It's a long detour to Dead Lake. What would we find?
TAYLOR: Nothing much. The remnants of a life raft. Maybe a small flag. The emblem of my countrymen.
CORNELIUS: Sorry, Taylor. The terrain around that lake is poisonous. There is no fresh water, no vegetation. Nothing.
TAYLOR: I know ... Nevertheless, I thank you for saving us. You'll be in trouble for going there.
