Does charging near maximum C rate have the same effect as high battery levels? We know: The maximum C-rate decreases with the increasing charging state. Let's assume an 2 Ah Lithium-Ion or Lithium-Polymer mobile phone battery. (2 Ah is considered tiny in 2018, but this is just an example).The internal charging current is 3 A (1.5 C) at 0% to 50% (couldn't it be higher at 0% than at 50%?)At 50%, it starts decreasing, so it reaches 1C (which is 2A) at 75%.Then it decreases from 1C to 0.1C throughout My question is:<br>Does the same charging speed at a higher battery level (e.g. 75%) produce more heat and consume more lifespan, because it is closer to the maximum possbile C rate?It is said to be unhealthy for a mobile phone battery to be charged to indicated 100% due to internal pressure.Would this internal battery pressure also take effect if I charged the battery too quickly at a high level such as 85%?
