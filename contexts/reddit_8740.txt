How does the Obama Administration's record on appointing donors and bundlers to government positions compare to Reagan, Bush 1&2 and Clinton administration.
One of the items that has raised some buzz in yesterday's [Guccifer 2.0 release of more DNC emails](https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/775823293781794816) is a [document tracking the donations of major DNC donors and the government positions they were appointed to] (http://www.economicpolicyjournal.com/2016/09/hot-dnc-pay-tor-play-ambassadorships.html).

However, U.S. presidents rewarding donors with ambassadorships is a long established practice, and at a minimum [many of the donors in the latest leak have been tracked and reported](https://www.opensecrets.org/obama/ambassadors.php) before. 

How does the Obama Administration compare with previous administration in the quantity and quality of appointments. For example one thing that stood out was the name of the previous FCC Chairman's post went to the second highest donor in the list -- Julius Genachowski. Is the problem getting worse? or better?

I was able to get an article [comparing numbers for Bush and Clinton](https://scholarsandrogues.com/2007/06/25/bushs-patronage-appointments-to-ambassador-exceed-fathers-clintons/), but nothing on non-ambassadorial positions. I was not able to find anything across all recent presidents.
