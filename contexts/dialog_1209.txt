JACK: Did you hear that?
DAVID: I heard that.
JACK: What was it?
DAVID: Could be a lot of things.
JACK: Yeah?
DAVID: A coyote.
JACK: There aren't any coyotes in England.
DAVID: The Hound of the Baskervilles.
JACK: Pecos Bill.
DAVID: Heathcliffe.
JACK: Heathcliffe didn't howl.
DAVID: No, but he was on the moors.
JACK: It's a full moon, 'beware the moon'.
JACK: I vote we go back to The Slaughtered Lamb.
DAVID: Yeah.
