Gravity canceling space gun vs black hole Not sure how to say this simpler, so we'll try shorter.We have a big space gun.  It makes gravity not be there where it shoots.It shoots at a black hole.Does black hole go boom?And for the tricky question, we'll get crazy and define the space gun a little more rigidly.So, treat the space gun like it creates a cylinder (that's one of those circular things with height) of totally nullified gravity.  That cylinder has a radius much smaller than the event horizon of the black hole.  It is aimed straight at the center of the black hole.Will that still cause the black hole to go boom?Also, we don't care about the fate of the space gun, or even where it is.  Also, we can treat the cylinder as though it has effectively infinite height, unless it really matters.
