Did Luke know about Kylo Ren's obsession with Darth Vader? One of the most notable aspects of Kylo Ren's character is his obsession with Darth Vader, evident in how he prays to Vader's charred helmet, how he tries to emulate him by wearing a mask, and even trying to obtain Anakin's lightsaber at the end of The Force Awakens.In The Last Jedi when<blockquote class=\"spoiler\">   Luke confronts Kylo Ren on Crait, we see Luke wielding the blue lightsaber.  While Luke probably did not know that the ligthsaber in question had been destroyed earlier, a common explanation that I have heard for why Luke chose to appear with a blue lightsaber instead of his green one was in an effort to taunt Kylo, since he coveted the weapon.</blockquote>However, I don't recall Luke ever mentioning that Ben was obsessed with (or at least interested in) Vader while Luke was training him; only that Luke had sensed darkness in Ben and that Snoke had already influenced him.In addition to that, I could not find any footage of Rey ever saying anything about it to Luke.  Is there any extant material to indicate that Luke was aware of Kylo Ren's obsession at any point?  If so, is there any indication that Luke chose to display the blue lightsaber for this reason?
