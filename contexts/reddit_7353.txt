Retroactive pay cut?!? Is this legal?
I work a retail job where I had been on salary working 4 10hr shifts/week. I am currently the only employee. On 5/20 I got an email from my boss informing me of a "company wide change" that effective 5/15, there will no longer be salaried employees and my hours will be cut to part time.

Is this legal? I know that bosses can cut hours and the like, but I don't see this retroactive stuff being ok. 

I want to quit tomorrow when I go into work, but I don't know if I can demand my appropriate prorated pay based on my salary.

Advice please!!!!
