I might land a job that pays significantly more with a lot less work. Is this right to feel I don't deserve it?
It's a weird question but I'll try to explain. So I work a job right now that pays close to minimum wage, but it's pretty much backbreaking, sweatshop type work. I might get a job that pays a little over four times as much, but it's a cakewalk compared to what I do now. For example, I'll have time to sneak in some YouTube videos as I work or post on Reddit, while I usually have to take Advil after what I do now. Is it wrong to feel like I don't deserve what I will be earning? It honestly feels like I'm cheating, and I have a lot of respect for the type of people I work with.
