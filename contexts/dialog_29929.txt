JOHN: Why would I kill her?
JAKE: Because I'm sick and tired of her little games. Because you could do it and drift away on your boat and no one would ever see you again. Because I've got a fifty-thousand dollar life insurance policy on her, and I would be more than happy to give the man who does her in a good chunk of it.
JOHN: I'm not a murderer, Mr. McKenna.
JAKE: How do you know if you've never tried?
JOHN: This is a joke, right? You just want to rattle me. Right?
