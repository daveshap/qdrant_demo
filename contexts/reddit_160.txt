Should I quit a club I’ve done for so long? It feels like betrayal.
Hi. Basically I’m the type of person who likes doing sports. I do martial arts, netball, basketball and want to start dance (modern). However, the time this dance is on clashes with martial arts (tkd specifically).

The thing is... I’m not sure if I want to do tkd anymore. I used to love it and have a passion for it but now I dread Tuesdays and fridays (when I have it). One of my instructors works at a gym as a personal trainer, so we spend majority of the session doing really hard and tiring exercises, bare in mind that I’m 14, and one of the older ones. But I’ve been doing tkd for years, my sister does it and I’ve competed and won stuff. I feel like it’s a big part of my identity and what makes me me. I just don’t enjoy it anymore. My black belt grading is soon, (2 months) so I can’t miss any sessions.

Also I now don’t like competitions. Back in February 2019 I broke both bones in my wrist fighting someone at training. Since then, I’ve kind of been scared that I’m gonna get injured and I’ve moved up a category too (lightweight to middleweight). The girls in this category are a lot bigger than me so this makes me even more scared.

So all of this in account, idk if I wanna do it anymore. If I stopped I would feel like I’m betraying my instructor and all my friends there (basically family). But I really want to start dance. My friend would join it too because she is free but I am obviously not. Also, I’ve never really done dance before (unless u count baby ballet) and if I joined a different club all by myself I’d be really behind and lonely. I JUST DON’T KNOW! 

I guess I could quit tkd after I make black belt, but that would feel wrong as it would look like I’m only in it to get a black belt. 
Please help! I need advice! I’m aware that this is a lot to read and probably doesn’t make sense but I will take any advice I can get.
Thanks x
