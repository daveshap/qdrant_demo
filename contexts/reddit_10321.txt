Nobody genuinely wants to help you in the real world
If you start getting depressed or lash out, first thing they'll think of you is you are dangerous. They'll look for a solution in mental institutions, medicine, restraining - anything to keep you from doing harm. 

They'll call you selfish for bringing hurt to them by trying to solve your own hurts. To them, you should suffer in silence and never exist.

The stories in the movies, books, etc. are all wrong. Humans are selfish, first and foremost. Jesus does not exist in real life. And no, he will not come to comfort you or understand you in your darkest moments. Nobody will, that's why it's just a myth.

To them, you're just an animal. A human turned into a zombie, that needs to be taken out. Your emotions aren't valid responses to your environment. To them, you are broken.
