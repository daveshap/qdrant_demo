GENCO: The 'patrone' is here.
VITO: Chi?
GENCO: Roberto. Who owns the 'rat-holes.'
ROBERTO: Excuse me, I hope I am not a disturbance, Don Corleone.
VITO: Yes.
ROBERTO: What a terrible misunderstanding. Of course, Signora Colombo can stay in the flat. Who were those miserable tenants to complain about noise from a poor animal...when they pay such low rent.
ROBERTO: Your good heart in helping the poor widow has shamed me, and I want to show that I, too, have some Christian charity. Her rent will remain what it was.
VITO: What was that?
ROBERTO: In fact, reduced, bu five dollars!
VITO: I accept your generosity...
ROBERTO: I won't keep you another minute...
