Someone went out of their way to try and invalidate my dyslexia :(
Coming here to vent.

So, in a Uni tutorial, we were all divided into small groups to answer a sheet of questions.  Everyone read out the questions in a round. When it came for me to read, I politely excused myself because of my dyslexia - a request that's received with no bother.

But, one guy in the group said "Oh come on, that's not an excuse! I'm dyslexic!" To which I irately replied, "I think you'll find it is!", causing everyone else to laugh.

Then for some reason, he kept going and said "Well, everyone else has already done it", as that was supposed to somehow guilt trip me into doing what he wanted. I sighed, and simply replied as calmly as possible "Look, I not gonna read it. It would make me feel very uncomfortable". He gave in, but you could tell that he thought I was a dick for questioning his demands.

Fuck you! You wouldn't question a guy with CP for not doing sports, why would you do the same for a learning difficulty? As it that's somehow invalid - who the fuck do you think you are? And later you had the nerve to imply that I was acting cold towards you for not reason. Christ - I'm so fucking mad right now!

Whether it was done out of malice or ignorance, some people need to think a bit more about what they say to others before spouting their stupid, offensive opinions!
