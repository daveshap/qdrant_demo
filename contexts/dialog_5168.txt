FERRARI: Hello, Rick.
RICK: Hello, Ferrari. How's business at the Blue Parrot?
FERRARI: Fine, but I would like to buy your cafe.
RICK: It's not for sale.
FERRARI: You haven't heard my offer.
RICK: It's not for sale at any price.
FERRARI: What do you want for Sam?
RICK: I don't buy or sell human beings.
FERRARI: That's too bad. That's Casablanca's leading commodity. In refugees alone we could make a fortune if you would work with me through the black market.
RICK: Suppose you run your business and let me run mine.
FERRARI: Suppose we ask Sam. Maybe he'd like to make a change.
RICK: Suppose we do.
FERRARI: My dear Rick, when will you realize that in this world today isolationism is no longer a practical policy?
RICK: Sam, Ferrari wants you to work for him at the Blue Parrot.
SAM: I like it fine here.
RICK: He'll double what I pay you.
SAM: Yeah, but I ain't got time to spend the money I make here.
RICK: Sorry.
