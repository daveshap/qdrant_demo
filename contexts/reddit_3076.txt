Anybody feel scared that time invested in learning something new won't pay off?
I'm 23, currently on minimum wage and I've been stuck in this period of mentally going from job to job not being able to get anywhere or commit to anything. I got a good degree in Visual Communication but i've yet to be able to do anything with it. I finished uni and got a job which I've been at for around 7 months now. I thought web dev - amongst other things - would be my thing, but could never commit.

Now, I think I've found that UI/UX design could be on the right track, since I have some design experience and my degree is related. To be honest, I'm worried that this won't work out, that I'll either change my mind or spend all this time learning new skills which won't pay off. That I won't be able to get a decent job in the field and I'll be back at square one learning something new again. I'm trying to get myself into a decent career to get my life moving.

How do I commit to a career decision because this 'resetting' is wearing me down?
