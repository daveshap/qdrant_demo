GLAUCUS: What do you want?
HAROLD: I'm sorry. I was looking for Maude.
MAUDE: Harold?
HAROLD: Maude???!
MAUDE: How about some ginger pie?
HAROLD: Eh, fine.
MAUDE: I'll heat some up. My, it's nice to see you again, Harold. How's your hearse?
HAROLD: Oh, it's fine. Fine.
MAUDE: She seemed yare to me.
HAROLD: Do you often model for Glaucus?
MAUDE: Heavens no! I don't have the time. But I like to keep in practice and poor Glaucus occasionally needs his memory refreshed as to the contours of the female form. Do you disapprove?
HAROLD: Me! No. Of course not.
MAUDE: Really. Do you think it's wrong?
HAROLD: No.
MAUDE: Oh, I'm so happy you said that because I wanted to show you my paintings. This is the Rape of Rome" and
MAUDE: A self-portrait. But over here is my favorite. It's titled Rainbow with Egg Underneath and an Elephant." Do you like it?"
HAROLD: Yes. Very much.
MAUDE: It was my last. I then became infatuated with these -- my Odorifics.""
