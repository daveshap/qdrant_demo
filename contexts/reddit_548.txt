Need some help on meeting people
So over this summer i have had a bit to much "fun". Overboard with the partying and going to house parties thing so my mom felt as it was best to send me to live with my dad for a bit. It has been fine i had no problem meeting new people, usually. But i just dropped out of high school as i needed to get a full time job to help with the bills and cost of living etc. I have no idea how i meet people now without going to school anymore. Just looking for advice on how to meet people as i just moved into a new city (the city is huge like biggest city in my state, Seattle if anyone was wondering). Any Advice is greatly appreciated.
