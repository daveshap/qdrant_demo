my friends all have a group chat without me
Yesterday I found out that my whole friend group has a group chat w/o me on it, because one of my friends was like “ How do I respond do what so-and-so said on the group chat?” and because I didn’t get a text, I asked “What group chat?”. She responded by saying “Oh are you not on this?” I said no and it was an awkward silence. Today it came up again, where my friend was wondering where we all were during lunch so she facetimed that group but i’m not on it, so I was sitting with two of my friends watching them join the call while I couldn’t. When I asked again about which group it was, she showed it to me, and it’s everyone except me, which. confuses me because no one has ever had an issue with me or brought anything they don’t like about me up at all. I also doubt it was a situation where they just didn’t realize I wasn’t on it, because there are six of us and the group is called “the high fives” (haha get it because like a high five but also five people that act high all the time) so it’s very clear that they knew only five people were in the group. My friends don’t really talk about feelings or serious shit that often and we just kind of mess around, how do I bring it up and say that it really hurt me without seeming like I’m being sensitive or annoying, or that one friend who’s not on the chat because no one likes them. Please please please help me i don’t know what to do!!
