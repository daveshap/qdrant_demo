MAJOR: Complete your inspection?
DUPONT: They're nothing but boys. It will be a slaughter tomorrow.
MAJOR: I doubt much can change that. The enemy has five brigades waiting for us.
DUPONT: We need more time.
MAJOR: Won't get it. We are a sacrifice. A diversion.
MAJOR: Eat up Dupont. It will probably be your last.
DUPONT: Not likely.
DUPONT: I thought I gave orders the regiment was to drill.
MULET: Staff sargeant detailed me to prepare firewood for the break- fast cooking.
DUPONT: What is your position?
MULET: Second musketeer.
DUPONT: I understand you joined up in Bremen.
MULET: You seem to understand a great deal.
DUPONT: I am a Major, Private. You would do well remembering that when addressing me.
MULET: Excuse me, sir". I thought we spoke as equals."
DUPONT: Equals?
MULET: If you wish to play games, Major.
DUPONT: Wait. I think we understand each other.
MULET: We have no understanding.
DUPONT: Then it is time two of us did. You are very young. I was once young. I can help.
MULET: Help? I've seen others help". Somehow a head always ended up on the counter."
DUPONT: It can be different. It must be.
MULET: It never changes, Major.
DUPONT: We must talk.
MULET: Stay out of it.
DUPONT: Don't threaten me, Private.
MULET: Who do you think I am? One of your freckle faced children waiting to die tomorrow? Threaten you"? You and I just living will always be a threat. Forever. Look at your life
DUPONT: Do not turn your back on me.
MULET: You are really going to force this, aren't you?
DUPONT: Either you are with me or against me.
