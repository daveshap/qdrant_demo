Life around a different element from Carbon On Earth, life developed around Carbon (and Hydrogen and Oxygen). I guess this depends on the availability of those elements, but also on the spectrum of radiation and Temperature and Pressure. Under different conditions, could have life developed around a different element, like Silicon?To formulate the question in a different way: are there some physical conditions, for example high pressure/temperature under which chemistry would be different? in particular can someone think of some physical conditions under which silicon would develop polymers / complex molecules?
