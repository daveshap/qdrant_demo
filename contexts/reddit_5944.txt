What’s the better option? To study to be a gender therapist, or go into an apprenticeship as a carpenter?
I’m currently 18, and have been looking at multiple colleges.

Personally, I’ve never been much of a school person, although I’ve always loved psychology. I want a job where I can live comfortably, and support myself. I’d also like to have some what of a balance between work, and home life. 

I don’t have too much money right now, and am not sure if I’d even be able to pay for all those years of college. Although, I’m told I’d be able to get a free ride due to my situation 

I guess I’m just scared if I choose to go into carpentry, I may regret it later. I don’t have too many friends, and feel I should get the “college experience.” I just don’t know what to really do. I also wanted to use college so I could get dorming, because I’m temporarily living at my grandmothers until I can get on my two feet. 

Anyone have experience in either of these two fields?
