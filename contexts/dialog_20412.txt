KAREN: Oh, God...
FOLEY: I called your room from downstairs.
KAREN: If I had answered, what were you gonna say?
FOLEY: Well, I'd say who I was and do you remember me and ask if you'd like to meet for a drink.
KAREN: If I remembered you. I came looking for you. I would've said sure, let's do it. But for all you knew I could show up with a SWAT team. Why would you trust me?
FOLEY: It would be worth the risk.
KAREN: You like taking risks.
FOLEY: So do you.
