GONZO: I saw these bastards in Easy Rider, but I didn't believe they were real. Not like this. Not hundreds of them!
DUKE: They're actually nice people when you get to know them.
GONZO: Man, I know these people in my goddamn blood!
DUKE: Don't mention that word around here. You'll get them excited.
GONZO: This is a fucking nightmare.
DUKE: Right. Sure as hell some dope-dealing bomb freak is going to recognize you and put the word out that you're partying with a thousand cops.
