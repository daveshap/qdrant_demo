SPORT: Here, officer, take me in. I'm clean. I didn't do it. Got a ticket once in Jersey. That's all. Honest, officer.
TRAVIS: Your name Sport?
SPORT: Anything you say, officer.
TRAVIS: I'm no cop. I want some action.
SPORT: I saw. $20 fifteen minutes. $30 half hour.
TRAVIS: Shit.
SPORT: Take it or leave it.
