tilt switch to activate power socket I am after a way to activate a 300 W LED lamp to come on when a trampoline is jumped on and to turn off when the mat goes level again, then back on when jumped on and so forth.I was thinking tilt switch but unsure if it would work right, so was wondering if anyone had any ideas. I am also open for the idea for someone to make it for me too. I need to make about 85 of them.
