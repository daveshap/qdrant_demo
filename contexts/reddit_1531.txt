My anxiety has made me less feminine
I've always felt pretty girly.  At the beginning of college and prior, I was super preppy and loved dressing up, collecting makeup, doing my hair, etc.  As my anxiety worsened through college, I unconsciously stopped spending time on those things.  

I'm realizing now that part of my anxiety is a fear of looking vain in any capacity.  To the point where I would be afraid to wear earrings or paint my nails or update my profile picture on Facebook because it would seem like I was trying too hard or looking for attention.  

Upon reflection, thats a ridiculous way to live.  I'm literally afraid to express myself in any way because I'm afraid of??? Imposing myself on other people?  Being myself and finding out who might not like me?  The actual reasons aren't 100% clear to me yet, but I'm at least glad I've figured this part out.  

Upon recognizing this, I painted my nails, put on earrings, AND updated my profile picture (to a picture with just me in it for the first time!!) all because I wanted to!  

Weird baby steps.
