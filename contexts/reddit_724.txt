i just want a distraction
hi,,??   
this is my first time asking for advice, its kind of a last resort ditch effort type of thing for me

to put it simply, im not happy. with my life, myself, anything

the days just slip by and they're all the same, parents fight every single fucking day like clockwork, sisters off at boarding school and i have no where to go. nothing to do

atm im homeschooled and have no friends outside of the internet, my closest "real life" friend being four hours away (and i can't drive legally)

i think because im alone so much, i obsess over everything concerning me. i'ts been a year, i developed an eating disorder and without help it's not getting any better. my overall view on myself is horrible, i just want - i need something to do to distract me from everything. fucking, anything

my neighborhood is pretty safe, i live in a suburban area w/ a park close by and town within biking distance. but its also winter and cold as balls so the motivation to bulk up in clothes and go out to.. do what??? exactly - i dont know what to do 

fuck i dont even know what im asking for??? suggestions??? ways to get out of the house??? god damn just a fucking hobby maybe jjsfsjgfsngnsgsn
