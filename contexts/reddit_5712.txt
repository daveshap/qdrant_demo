Advice for a new beginning
Good day/night to you all! I'm your typical, anxious, unskilled, weirdo who obviously has no direction in life at all.  I'm 20 years old and have never had a job or volunteer experience; reason for this is a combination of laziness, depression (constant suicidal thoughts), extreme social anxiety, a severe stutter that I've had since childhood, not knowing how to drive and not being in shape (underweight). To top it all off I have absolutely zero skills at all.

I'm basically your average redditor haha, question is; what baby steps can I take to counteract this common salvageable problem? A goal of mine is to obtain a job and save up funds, then I'm planning to try out an apprenticeship program for an electrician trade.  The colleges in my country don't have any majors I'm interested in (I don't live in America, Britain or Canada) and I'm just not really interested in college at all.

Does this at all sound wise? Can anyone give me tips on writing a resume? Any social pointers you folks can give me? Thank you all in advance!
