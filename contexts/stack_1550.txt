Connecting a 48 V battery to a grid tie inverter I am working on a grid tied wind system project. I am planning to use a battery in the system which will be the source to the grid-tie inverter. Also the battery will be used only as a source to the grid-tie inverter and will not be used for back-up. So, the connection is as follows:Wind generator (2 kW AC) ----> Rectifier/charge controller ----> 48 V, 5 kWh Battery ----> Grid-tie inverter ----> GridWill a grid tie inverter be able to take input from a 48 V battery?Is this type of connection feasible?Any guidance is much appreciated. Thanks
