So my boss won't let me impress him
I work for a small startup and in a startup it's common to work outside your job description and put on many hats. I want to get promoted and impress. I'm thinking and analyzing the strategic situation of the company and want to provide the best ROI for my salary to the company. This is mostly because I want better job, better salaries, better pay etc. 

And then I'm trying to get an MBA which is all about demonstrating success, promotions and leadership.

The problem is that my boss won't really let me. I fulfill my main responsibilities pretty well. However any idea I give to my boss gets shot down and he just tells me to do my job. I once worked one a branding guide and showed it to my boss and he tells me that I wasted my time and got angry. I offered to write research papers, blog posts, and liason with specialists for new product research, but that got shot down. I demonstrate products with skills that I have, but all that gets shut down. Despite me doing the work and fulfiling my main responsibilities (I'm the top worker in the team). I asked my boss directly what problems he has, how best I can address them, and that I can provide a lot more to the company than my main responsibilites, and he tells me to stop wasting time and do your job. 

Do I need to look for another job? I've been at this for 6 months. It feels like a deadend. I'm not learning anything useful, and I am not just not being given the ability to impress.

I'll feel like I'll never get into a good MBA program with the job that I have.
