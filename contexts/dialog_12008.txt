HANNAH: Ohh!
HOLLY: You know.
HANNAH: I know, no-- I know.
HOLLY: I mean, y-you know, don't say it that way, you know, because my confidence is not my strong point, I--
HANNAH: No, I'm sorry. No, I didn't mean that. No, I didn't mean that.
HOLLY: Uh, you know, I think I can fake my way through a song.
HANNAH: Uh-huh.
HOLLY: Easily.
HOLLY: W-why? You don't think it's realistic?
HANNAH: No, I didn't, I, that's no. No, I- I-I, no, I-I just... hate to see you put yourself in a position where, where you get hurt, you know. You know, you know how you take...
HOLLY: Yeah.
HANNAH: ...every, eh, single rejection as- as-as a...a confirmation that you have no talent, or something?
HOLLY: Yeah. Well, maybe I'll get it.
HANNAH: I hope.
HOLLY: Boy, you really know how to cut me down.
HANNAH: What? You don't, don't be so sensitive. Can't I say anything?
HOLLY: Tch, well, I sing! For Chrissake, Hannah, you heard me sing!
