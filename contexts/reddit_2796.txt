How transparent should I be after being terminated?
I was abruptly let go from my employer for violating their time reporting policy. My project job leader wasn't pleased with the verdict as this could've been a teachable moment for my benefit where a warning would've sufficed. Nevertheless, he has offered to be a strong reference for me, and I'm grateful that I have that support. I dwell and feel genuine regret over this anomalous incident, but I recognize that it's made me a better person.

Moving forward, my questions are:

* How transparent should I be to my professional network in regards to finding my next role? 
* What are recommended job search strategies, particularly during the pandemic?
* Tips on evading inquiries from ex-coworkers, family members, or friends  when it's still a sensitive matter for me to share?
* Should I be transparent to a recruiter when they ask why I left the organization or wait until the interview with the hiring manager?

Edit: Addressing some questions, this was my first job out of grad school, it was my first offense and a misunderstanding on my part with no monetary benefit or expectations of being paid more as dictated by the companyâ€™s compensation policies.
