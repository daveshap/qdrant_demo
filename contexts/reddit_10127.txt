Should I report him or man up?
So, I'll spare the details and get to the point. I recently failed a class and after talking to a professor, he directed me to the department head to see my options. Needless to say, this guy was rude and somewhat demeaning. Now this wouldn't be a problem, but over the course of our 15-20 minute conversation, he not only told me that I probably shouldn't be within the major I'm aiming for, but he also felt the need to tell me he'll get me blacklisted at every uni in the state for telling anyone any different then exactly what he was telling me. This was also accompanied by him feeling the need to explain why the class was necessary and that it basically wasn't his problem to fix.

I thought about reporting him to Student Affairs, but I figured I just needed to grow a pair and deal. But, apparently he's been acting this way towards many students, even going so far to deny entry to specific classes on a whim, with little to no explanation. So, now it feels like reporting him might be the right thing to do, but I'm not sure.
