Are Graduate Assistantships Feasible For A Masters Student?
I just finished my undergrad, completing a double major in math and physics. I am taking a gap year to continue to work for a professor. I am considering going to grad school for a master's in applied math or computer science.

But geez school is expensive. Ideally I would like to obtain a graduate assistantship which would waive tuition. I've considered pursuing a PhD, but the stress of 4-6 more years of school does not appeal to me, especially when I don't have extremely clear goals when it comes to what I would want to research. I was just wondering, how often are Graduate Assistantships offered to masters students? All the information I can find online tends to be geared towards PhD students. Is it something that I can count on getting if I base my choice in school on it? Is it something not commonly offered because grad schools aren't willing, or because most students don't want to do it?
