My friend just beat the shit out of this guy
He just told me that it happened earlier today. 

It's his birthday. He went to the mall with his girlfriend. He tells me it was great. I ask, "Yeah? Did you get any action?" He says, "No, I got to beat the shit out of my girlfriend's stalker." Pause. "What?"


He tells me that there's this guy who's "been texting her" and "making her cry" as of late. Apparently, he broke his nose and knocked a few teeth out. I ask how the fuck that ended up happening, and he tells me that his girl and him planned it. Pause. "WHAT?" He tells me he went to the mall, had his girl text this guy and have him "meet her" there. "The rest is history," he says. 


Bewilderment is my initial reaction. Why? Because someone got their face smashed in for one. Why should that matter to me? Here's my worry: she fucking loved it. She probably suggested the idea. She probably told him, stop, he's had enough, please, stop...and relished the whole thing. 


My friend, he's very susceptible to control. If he says he likes cars, and I say I don't like cars, he'll reassure me that cars aren't all that great. 


When he tells me about this girl, I remember the little things. Things they do together, things that are always her idea. I'm worried about him. If what he did, he really did over some guy who apparently texted his girlfriend, then he does not have an breezy future with her. Especially if she keeps telling him that catalysts for drama made her "cry." 

I want to say something to him, but not the wrong thing. I'm afraid he'll get defensive.
