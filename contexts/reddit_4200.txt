Do not follow/friend request someone you find on a dating app.
I do not have my last name, or social media on my dating apps because I do not know you, so I don’t want you to find me if we haven’t matched.  I am not interested in followers.  I do not need likes.  It’s a dating etiquette that maybe isn’t as a ‘big deal’ to some, but it should JUST be the default if I have no trace of where to find my social media ... which is private.  

I hope I am not the abnormal here.  I know there are people that put their accounts on their dating apps and to each their own.  Those people want followers.  Follow them instead.  Thank you.
