What specific actions did Dick Cheney take to consolidate power during his Vice Presidency?
Vice President Dick Cheney (2001-2009) has been cited as the '[Most Powerful Vice President](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=99422633)' the United States [has ever had](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6096042.stm).

He earned this reputation in part because of way he was tied to major initiatives like [enhanced interrogation](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/25/washington/25detain.html), the Guantanamo Bay detention camp (in 1st source), the [Iraq War](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5024408), and the [Bush era tax cuts](https://www.cbpp.org/research/claim-that-tax-cuts-pay-for-themselves-is-too-good-to-be-true#_ftn3), which are just a few of the noteworthy moves by the Bush administration.

In popular culture and more recently, Dick Cheney continues the [perception of having been an exceptionally powerful Vice President](http://time.com/5481092/vice-dick-cheney-review/).

I have a couple of questions:

1: What specific actions earned Cheney the reputation of being such a powerful Vice President? 

2: Historically, was Dick Cheney actually quite influential for a Vice President?
