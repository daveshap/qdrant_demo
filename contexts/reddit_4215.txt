Sick of being a means to an end
If you’re tired of being used by people:
- start putting yourself first
- learn to say NO
- make decisions based on behavioral patterns not “feelings”
- totally ignore feelings of guilt 
- plan ahead & only accommodate others when it benefits you 
- cut all leeches with a zero tolerance rule
