Very anxious about starting a new job Tuesday
So after a very LONG and ridiculous year of job searching, I was finally hired into what I hope to be an excellent job for me in a great location. I’m very happy to have the job, and everyone there is really great, but I’m *so anxious* about starting. Literally everything on the first week agenda gives me anxiety. Even the lunch they are paying for the first couple of days gives me anxiety. It’s killing me. It makes 0 sense because they are such nice people and I know they chose to hire me, but this is just about to kill me. 

Realistically I know I’m very lucky to have this job and I’ll be okay, I can’t quit stressing odd things that can happen between then and now. Starting and then they realize I’m not the person they hired from the interview. Getting into a car wreck or fender bender and not being able to drive the first day, making me late. Me not knowing enough about the job subject and looking like a goon. Me being completely overwhelmed despite the current person holding the job training me for months. Me saying something weird or off the wall or just being very quiet and shy, which is not at all my personality. 

I’m just so overwhelmed and this weekend before starting has been really hard. I have no friends here yet, though everyone is friendly. I just don’t know how to be less anxious about starting a new job.
