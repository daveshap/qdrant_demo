SAM: He didn't come back here?
LILA: Sam.
SAM: No Arbogast. No Bates. And only the old lady at home... A sick old lady unable to answer the door... or unwilling.
LILA: Where could he have gone?
SAM: Maybe he got some definite lead. Maybe he went right on...
LILA: Without calling me?
SAM: In a hurry.
LILA: Sam, he called me when he had nothing definite, nothing but a dissatisfied feeling. Don't you think he'd have called if he had anything...
SAM: Yes. I think he would have.
SAM: Let's go see Al Chambers.
LILA: Who's he?
SAM: He's the Deputy Sheriff around here.
SAM: Our Deputy sleeps.
LILA: Well?
SAM: Nothing. Just... all the lights out... must be asleep.
LILA: Does that mean we can't...
SAM: No. I'm just procrastinating. People hate when the doorbell rings in the middle of the night. Come on.
MRS. CHAMBERS: Oh?
SAM: Sorry, Mrs. Chambers. I hate bothering you...
MRS. CHAMBERS: You didn't! It's tinkerbell. Al wants to be sure he'll hear it if anyone rings it in the middle of the night. Well come on in, at least!
