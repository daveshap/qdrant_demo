CLAIRE: But he acted like he'd never heard of it.
JODY: Did he say that?
CLAIRE: Jody he was lying.
JODY: What if he was? Do you think he wanted to bring that up again just when you're trying to make a new start?
CLAIRE: I guess not.
JODY: He's trying to put it behind him, Claire. You should too.
JODY: You've got a beautiful life. And even with this, it's always been clear that he loves you. I've come to think that's all that really matters.
CLAIRE: I don't know...
JODY: Trust me, Claire. You hear something... change the subject. You find something... get rid of it, throw it in the lake. You know what happened. The rest is only details. And no one's ever glad they got a hold of those. If you want to put this back together...just let it go.
NORMAN: What's that for?
CLAIRE: Nothing.
NORMAN: I'm cooking you dinner.
CLAIRE: You don't have to do that.
NORMAN: I know.
CLAIRE: Fine. I'll do the shopping.
