Is it worth it to contact HR admin if I believe resumes are not being reviewed properly?

This may sound silly. I’ve been applying to internships after graduating, especially in government. One I applied for was just perfect for me. And even for a lab partner I’m friends with. I let them know about it and we both applied. There’s two spots available and I’d be happy for them if they got it. It’s the only internship in the exact stuff I worked on in college. I can check off everything. They want biology or environmental science degree current students. I have biology undergrad and working on env science grad. They want gis, I have a cert. it goes on. 

Unfortunately we both got, due to our supplemental question’s answers, we do not meet the minimum qualifications. We both think that’s weird. All of the questions were stuff like Can you lift 30 pounds? Can you work on uneven terrain? Yes. Yes yes yes. Only question one was Tell us what you know about environmental policy in the state. I love the state the internship is in and want to move there eventually. I did projects on areas in the state  on a topic in they desire. Unless I didn’t put EXACTLY what they wanted in this one question, I see no problem. 

Friend wants to send emails to the hradmin email regarding the individual who denied both based on that. I requested what was the problem as I don’t see it, without reply from the person. I don’t see any good that will come from going above them now. There’s just no way, even if we are right.
