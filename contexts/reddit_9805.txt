First time applying to SA jobs and I'm overwhelmed
Hi all,
I am currently in an online, part-time SA masters program through Colorado State. My only SA experience comes from being an RA in undergrad and I am currently unemployed. I've been looking at jobs in other states because California is too expensive and I'm ready for a change. I've reached out to others in the field and they all just refer me back to higheredjobs, which is a great resource, but also an online pit of applications. Is this really the only way to SA jobs? I feel like I'm just applying to whatever, wherever, but I would like to apply to a place I can stay and grow for years. Any suggestions? Tips?
