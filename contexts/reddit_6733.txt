Looking for thoughts on a position posted by different recruitment agencies.
Hi everyone,

Firstly, I would like to apologies if my question is a little vague because of all my previous positions I had were a direct hire and never had to deal with recruitment agencies.

I applied for Full-Time position in company X but I didn't get it and received a generic rejection email about no longer recruiting for that position. 

A recruitment company  approached me for a a Short-Term position in the same company X for amount $/hour (Different title than the full-time one) which I agreed on. A week passed and I saw another recruitment company posting the same position but with higher hourly rates ($5-$10/hour more).

I did contact the 1st recruitment company regarding this and they informed me that there were no news yet. 

So, any thoughts about this? About the 1st recruitment company and the low hourly rates in-compare to the 2nd recruitment company? Is there any meaning behind another recruiting company posting the same position?

Many thanks,

Wari
