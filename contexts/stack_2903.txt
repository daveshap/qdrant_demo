Could we get information from within a black hole using it's gravity? Say humans in the future could detect super small changes in gravity (like literally the difference between an earth with one extra atom and another earth).Could we send a machine into the black hole which can shift its weight away or closer to the black hole so that it can choose how much mass it wants to add to the singularity at a time. Would the change have an effect outside the event horizon for our incredible machine to detect.So if it works than if first bit of the information is 0 it shifts it's weight forward so our machine detects it and if it is it shifts it back so we find out a split second later?.Of course, there is the problem that from our perspective it would take ages (maybe forever if I remember correctly) from our perspective for the object to reach the singularity. So I propose a different version.The object falling to the black hole is horizontally entered and it can decide if it wants to move a heavy ball inside it to the left or to the right. If it is to the left it is a one or to the right it is a zero. this way we don't have to wait until it hits the singularity, just until it passes the event horizon.Would our machine detect it?(Note, this is not about the limits of the machine or us, more on whether or not the gravitational effect will carry on outside the event horizon)
