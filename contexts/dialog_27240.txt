SCULLY: Mulder -- it's me --
MULDER: Where are you, Scully?
SCULLY: I'm on the roof.
MULDER: Did you find something?
SCULLY: No. I haven't.
MULDER: What's wrong, Scully?
SCULLY: I've just climbed twelve floors. I'm hot and thirsty and I'm wondering, to be honest, what I'm doing here.
MULDER: You're looking for a bomb.
SCULLY: I know that. But the threat was called in for the Federal Building across the street.
MULDER: I think they have that covered.
SCULLY: Mulder... when a terrorist bomb threat is called in, the logical purpose of providing this information is to allow us to find the bomb. The rational object of terrorism is to promote terror. If you'd study model behavioral pattern in virtually every case where a threat has turned up an explosive device. If we don't act in accordance with that data -- if you ignore it as we have done -- the chances are great that if here actually is a bomb we might not find it. Lives could be lost --
SCULLY: Mulder...?
MULDER: What happened to playing a hunch?
SCULLY: Jesus, Mulder...
MULDER: The element of surprise, Scully. Random acts of unpredictability. If we fail to anticipate the unforeseen or expect the unexpected in a universe of infinite possibilities, we find ourselves at the mercy of anyone or anything that cannot be programmed, categorized or easily referenced...
