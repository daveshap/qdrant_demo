Can insulators transfer charge to conductors via conduction I was watching someone use a pith ball electroscope. The guy charged an ebonite rod by rubbing it with fur ( got it ). As the ebonite rod was brought closer to the pith ball, the pith ball was attracted to the rod ( got it ). After touching the rod the ball got repelled which clearly indicates transfer of charge to the ball (HOW!). I feel that ebonite is an insulator and the charges in it cannot move freely. So if I touch it with a conductor the charges must not get transferred but the experiment states otherwise.Can somebody pls explain what I am doing wrong here ? Thx
