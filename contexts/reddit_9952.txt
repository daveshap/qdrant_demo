Stages of Team Development
Hi everyone,

I've been tasked with putting together a training on the stages of team development in an interactive way. I am not quite sure where to start, and was hoping to get some suggestions.

I have 45 minutes to fill, and so far all I have to start is giving students 5-10 minutes to reflect and then share on teams they've been a part of and think about how they started, performed, and eventually ended. 

The goal is to stay discussion/interactive based with absolutely 0 lecture. Since the latter made up a majority of trainings I've been a part of, I could really use some ideas.
