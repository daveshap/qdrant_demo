So my date tonight was cancelled 30 mins before we met..hope your Saturday nights will go better than mine!
I better laugh heh. Met this girl yest face to face, spent 2 hours chatting , I really enjoyed it, so did she (at least she said). We agreed to go out for drinks today. I confirmed 2 hours ago, and booked a place. 15 mins ago she said she doesn't feel like going out. Im like, you could have told me before! She asked if I want to go near her and have a short chat in my car with her. Im like .. No. 

Needless to say, Im moving on.

So yeah, that's my Saturday night gone.

How are yours going?
