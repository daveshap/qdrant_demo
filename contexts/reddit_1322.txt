Does Anybody Else feel anxious when you are not doing anything?
Like, if you are working, then you have something to focus on, you didn’t feel anxious, and if you have a long holidays (like a week or so), and you have nothing else to do. You feel anxious for nothing. 

Any tips on this? 

Edit: thanks for all the comments, I’ve read all of them, feel so great that we are not alone here. :)
