NINOTCHKA: How are you, you three scoundrels?
KOPALSKI: Well, we're back home.
BULJANOFF: You know what they say -- there's nothing like home.
IRANOFF: That's right... and we might as well face it.
NINOTCHKA: Come, now, you must not talk that way.... You have to adjust yourselves.... We must be brave.
IRANOFF: Brave... that's right.
BULJANOFF: Let's be happy that we're all alive.
IRANOFF: And that's something we owe to Ninotchka.
KOPALSKI: If you hadn't given Commissar Razinin such a wonderful report about us, who knows what would have happened?
BULJANOFF: I can tell you exactly.
NINOTCHKA: Now let's forget everything except that we're together.
BULJANOFF: That's right.
IRANOFF: Let's do that.
KOPALSKI: It's a real Paris reunion.
IRANOFF: If you close your eyes and listen to our voices we might be in Paris.
NINOTCHKA: Let's not close our eyes. There are many good things to see here too.
BULJANOFF: I think I need my glasses.
KOPALSKI: A little more tact... look how nicely she's fixed the table -- all for us.
BULJANOFF: How nicely you've fixed the table, Ninotchka.
IRANOFF: What a lovely room you have here.
BULJANOFF: How many families live here with you?
NINOTCHKA: Only myself and two other girls. One is a cello player in the opera and the other a street-car conductor.
IRANOFF: Just three people in a room this size? Whew!
KOPALSKI: And your own gas cooker? That's marvelous! Naturally it's not the Royal Suite...
NINOTCHKA: Sssh! Once and for all, we're in Moscow!
KOPALSKI: Yes, there's no doubt of that... Just look out of the window and there it is.
NINOTCHKA: And it's great! Think what it was a few years ago and what it is now.
IRANOFF: She's right... anyhow let's talk ourselves into it.
BULJANOFF: Just see how happy the people look... from here....
KOPALSKI: Can you blame them?... at least the May Day parade is over.
BULJANOFF: That's another thing... it's spring.
NINOTCHKA: The same spring we had in Paris. Just as good.
KOPALSKI: Even the swallows are back.
