Should i take 30% pay cut?
I was recently laid off and got an offer with 30% pay cut

I was laid off in February and had multiples interviews including top tech companies but never got any offer. I mostly make it to final round with business plan they asked me to send over but they’d offer the role to another candidate. I felt like being used instead
I’m getting really depressed and doubt myself and just got an offer with 30% pay cut and I decided to accept it just to survive and add to my saving
Am I going to climb back up if everything become better?
