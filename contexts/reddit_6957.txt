Was terminated for "disruption to workplace" and need help with what to put on applications
Long story short, I got terminated from a veterinary hospital for getting into a fight with a doctor. The doctor had held me and 3 others 2 hours past closing time because they felt the need to help this client that the know. I had told the doctor that the system was closed multiple times so that we could leave and she insisted on getting back into our system and helping anyways. I got upset and lost my temper slammed my hand on a work table and yelled at the doctor after she was done helping the client and she contacted HR. Even though I had the 3 nurses who were also held back defending me, HR took the doctor side and terminated me. This was my first time ever having problems there in the 3 1/2 years that I worked there.

I have a new job lined up, but I don't know what to put as the reason for termination. I want to be honest of course but i'm afraid that they may see that as a reason to not hire me. Its been 3 months since losing my job and clients still come in and ask for me.

Any help would be appreciated, Thank you!
