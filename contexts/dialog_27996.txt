LOUISE: Oh, Thelma. Oh, no.
THELMA: I mean I finally understand what all the fuss is about. This is just a whole 'nother ball game!
LOUISE: Thelma, please get a hold of yourself. You're making a spectacle.
THELMA: You know, Louise, you're supposed to be my best friend. You could at least be a little bit happy for me. You could at least pretend to be slightly happy that for once in my life I have a sexual experience that isn't completely disgusting.
LOUISE: I'm sorry. I am happy. I'm very happy for you. I'm glad you had a good time. It's about time. Where is he now?
THELMA: Taking a shower.
LOUISE: You left that guy alone in the room?
