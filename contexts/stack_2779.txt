Is zero shadow day the longest day Wherever I read, I read that June 21st is the longest day for Northern Hemisphere, full stop. However the zero shadow day is different for different places. It is that day where the sun reaches the vertical point above. So shouldn't that be the longest day? In other words, up to the Tropic of Cancer, the longest day should be the Zero shadow days and above that it should be 21st June and that would have made sense but I cannot understand why it would be otherwise.Any thoughts regarding this would be helpful.P.S. I am not sure if this is the correct place to ask (since I couldn't find required tags) Please direct me to the right place if I am mistaken.
