How to go to the airport in Sofia after midnight? My next flight departs from Sofia on the morning, but I could not find how I can get to the airport from the city centre. The metro does not operate until 5:30 so I can't use as I must arrive before 5:00.I checked Uber, but only found that it stopped operations in Bulgaria. Also I walked around 0:00 to 4:00 these days but I didn't see any taxi.So is there any option to get to the airport? I feel I must arrive before midnight and stay at the airport for 5 hours...
