The Panama Papers: What do they tell us about the international financial system?
Recently, [over 11 million files were leaked](http://www.npr.org/2016/04/03/472890948/with-leak-of-panama-papers-a-glimpse-of-worlds-fiscal-underbelly) from a law firm based in Panama, revealing a broad international network of shady financial dealings. The leaks provide evidence for significant movements of illicit money around the world, including [12 world leaders and a wide range of other important officials and their relatives](https://projects.icij.org/panama-papers/power-players/?lang=en) from nations as diverse as Russia, the UK, Sudan, Rwanda and Iceland. One [especially tantalizing finding](http://indianexpress.com/article/world/world-news/all-the-presidents-men-vladimir-putins-secret-money-network/) was the uncovering of a $2 billion network connected to Vladimir Putin.

The law firm in question, Mossack Fonseca, is, according to NPR, one of the largest incorporators in the world, involved in the process of setting up shell corporations and offshore accounts. While neither activity is illegal, both are [frequently used](https://www.fincen.gov/news_room/rp/files/LLCAssessment_FINAL.pdf) to facilitate financial fraud.

While the leaks are still fairly recent and thus, thorough analysis still difficult to find, preliminary reports implicate a huge number of officials from nations rich and poor, democratic and autocratic alike. While officials in [Brazil](http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21695391-tarnished-president-should-now-resign-time-go?zid=305&ah=417bd5664dc76da5d98af4f7a640fd8a) and [Russia](http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Global-News/2016/0126/How-corrupt-is-Russia) have long been suspected of major corrupt activity, the papers also suggest significant fraud in nations like the UK and Iceland, among others. 

In light of this, what can we conclude about the global financial system? Attempts [have been made in the past](http://www.economist.com/news/business/21672232-europes-corporate-tax-havens-say-they-are-reforming-up-point-still-slipping-net) to eliminate tax havens and crack down on money laundering on the international level--what more can be done to this end? What does the implication of such a wide range of individuals say about our modern political system?
