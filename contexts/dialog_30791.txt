CLAIRE: Jody, she tried to kill him.
JODY: I know.
CLAIRE: I can't believe this is happening.
JODY: We need help. Please let me call the medium.
CLAIRE: That could take days. I need to do something now. Don't you see? She wants us dead.
JODY: Alight, alright. Stay calm. You opened this door. There's got to be a way that you can close it.
CLAIRE: Like what?
JODY: I have an idea. But, I mean, I'm just making this up...
CLAIRE: What is it?
