BLEEKER: Did you put like a hundred things of Tic Tacs in my mailbox?
JUNO: Yeah. That was me.
BLEEKER: Why?
JUNO: Because they're your fave. And you can never have too much of your favorite one-calorie breath mint.
BLEEKER: Well... thanks. I think I'm pretty much set until college on the Tic Tac front.
JUNO: You know, I've been thinking. I'm really sorry I was such a huge bitch to you. You didn't deserve that. You never deserve any of the poo I unload on you.
BLEEKER: You know it's okay.
JUNO: Also, I think I'm in love with you.
BLEEKER: What, you mean as friends?
JUNO: No, for real. I think you are the coolest person I've ever met. And you don't even have to try.
BLEEKER: I try really hard, actually...
JUNO: No, you're naturally smart. You always think of the funniest things to do. Remember when you passed me that postcard during Spanish class, and it was addressed like, Junebug MacGuff
BLEEKER: I was just bored. I only think school is awesome like, 80% of the time.
JUNO: Plus, you're the only person who doesn't stare at my stomach all the fucking time. You actually look at my face. And every time I look at you, the baby starts kicking me super hard.
BLEEKER: It does?
BLEEKER: Wizard!
JUNO: I think it's because my heart starts pounding when I see you.
BLEEKER: Mine too.
JUNO: Basically, I'm completely smitten with you, and I don't care if I'm making an ass out of myself right now, because you've seen me make an ass out of myself a million times, and you still want to be my friend.
BLEEKER: Well, yeah. You're the best friend I've ever had, even when you're being kind of evil.
JUNO: That's all I need from you. That's more than I could ever ask for. You're just golden, dude.
BLEEKER: Can we make out now?
JUNO: Okay.
