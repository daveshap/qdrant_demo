How to choose a career?
Hi. I'm 25 years old and have never known what I want to do. I completed a course in IT back in 2016 but haven't been motivated to do anything with it since.

I've been working in a restaurant for the past few years and I do somewhat enjoy it, but its not something I want to be doing for much longer as I hate the anti-social working hours, the pay is only just above minimum wage and there's not much in terms of progression.

My parents are always trying to convince me to go back to education but I'm reluctant simply because I don't know what I would do and I don't want to end up wasting a whole load of time and money on something I may not like.

So does anyone on here know of any tips on deciding what to pursue?

Thanks
