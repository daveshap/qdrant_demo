SIMONE: No, I'm okay.
FRANK BRAND: Let's talk about the work that you care so much about.
SIMONE: Sure. Where would you like to start?
FRANK BRAND: How about the nudity?
SIMONE: Nudity has just never been an issue for me, Frank. For me, clothes are just an option.
FRANK BRAND: What exactly was it that attracted you to your first two projects?
SIMONE: I suppose the thing I like most about the movies I'm in is that they're not about special effects.
