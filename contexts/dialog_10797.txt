SPENGLER: We'll do the happiness index next. I'd like to bring Ray in on your case, if it's all right with you.
DANA: Okay, whatever you think -- but not Venkman.
SPENGLER: Oh no.
DANA: Do you ever see him?
SPENGLER: Occasionally
DANA: How is he these days?
SPENGLER: Venkman? I think he was borderline for a while there. Then he crossed the border.
DANA: Does he ever mention me?
SPENGLER: No. Not that I can recall.
