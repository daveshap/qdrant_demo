MAJOR HICKS: General Anderson, the problem was the terrain. If we lure him out into a more open area such as this portion of Central Park... We should be able to take him down.
MAYOR: Last time you didn't even scratch it!
MAJOR HICKS: That's not true. Our worm guy, er, I mean, Dr. Tatopoulos found blood.
NICK: Well, yes. I did. Clearly he was injured and bled.
MAJOR HICKS: You see, all we need to do is get a better shot at it with weapons that don't rely on heat seeking...
NICK: Um, excuse me, sir, but the situation's more complicated than that. The blood I recovered revealed that the creature is either about to lay eggs or already has.
