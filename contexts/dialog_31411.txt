JAMES LEER: Humboldt County?
GRADY: Maybe...
JAMES LEER: It's my father. He gets it from his doctor.
GRADY: Glaucoma?
JAMES LEER: Colon cancer.
GRADY: Jesus, James. Wow.
JAMES LEER: It's a bit of a scandal. My parents live in a small town.
GRADY: Where's that?
JAMES LEER: Carvel.
GRADY: Carvel? Where's Carvel?
JAMES LEER: Outside Scranton.
GRADY: I never heard of it.
JAMES LEER: It's a hellhole. Three motels and a mannequin factory. My dad worked there for thirty-five years.
GRADY: Your father worked in a mannequin factory?
JAMES LEER: Seitz Plastics. That's where he met my mom. She was a fry cook in the cafeteria. Before that, she'd been a dancer.
GRADY: What kind of dancer?
JAMES LEER: Whatever kind they wanted her to be.
GRADY: James Leer, are you telling me your mother was a stripper?
JAMES LEER: I'm telling you what I was told by my uncle. And he should know. He ran half a dozen men's clubs in Baltimore before he skipped town on a bad debt.
GRADY: Didn't you say your Mom went to Catholic school?
JAMES LEER: When we fall, we fall hard.
GRADY: Amazing.
GRADY: I thought you were the guy who didn't like to lose control of his emotions.
JAMES LEER: Maybe I just needed the moment to present itself.
JAMES LEER: This is so nice. It's like where Andy Hardy would live. What's it called again?
GRADY: Kinship.
JAMES LEER: Kinship. And what's here?
GRADY: Unless I miss my bet... my wife.
JAMES LEER: The one that left you?
GRADY: That's right. That one.
JAMES LEER: Someone jumped on your car with their butt...
GRADY: How can you tell?
JAMES LEER: You can see the outline of a butt.
JAMES LEER: Want one. They're incredible. Incredible.
GRADY: Smoke the rest of that joint, James, and you can start on the box.
JAMES LEER: Maybe she didn't come here.
GRADY: She came here. We'll just wait. In the meantime, I need you to shimmy through.
GRADY: Relax. Emily hasn't carried a house key since she was twelve years old. And your hips are as slim as hers.
JAMES LEER: It's not that. It just reminded me of -- you know -- of what's in the car. In the trunk.
GRADY: Oh. Right. Well, let's try not to think about that.
JAMES LEER: It feels really... good... here.
GRADY: I know. It's the house you want to wake up in on Christmas morning. Make yourself at home. I'll be right back.
