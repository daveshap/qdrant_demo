Side projects
Greetings seasoned beans. 

I'm an incoming immunology PhD student. I have about two and a half years of being in a lab under my belt, with about 60% of that during undergrad (so I only had one thing I was working on) and 40% of the rest spent as a post-bacc student. 

How normal is it to have multiple projects - and if you have more than one, are they in the same realm as your main one or are they in different areas? 

I had multiple projects assigned to me during this start of my post-bacc program and I was never fully invested in them besides the first one. I'm wondering if it was because they were in completely different areas (my main one studying in vivo autoimmune stuff and another being in in vrito allergy stuff) or if I was just at project management. If the latter is the case, is there anything that helped you with project management? 

While I'm here, does anyone have any good intro to computational immunology resources they'd like to recc to a newb? I know I can google this (which I fully intend to do), I just wanted to see if there was a jumping off point that anyone especially liked. 

Sincerely,
