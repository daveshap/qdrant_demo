How do US laws regarding free speech differ from those in the rest of the world?
Compared with the rest of the world, [people in the US are generally more accepting of free speech.](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/11/18/where-the-world-sees-limits-to-free-speech/) But from a legal standpoint, is the US really an outlier?

Harvard's Fredrick Schauer [believes so:](https://books.google.com.pa/books?id=9NKaXYtw9YUC&pg=PA652&lpg=PA652#v=onepage&q&f=false)

> â€¦the American First Amendment, as authoritatively interpreted, remains a recalcitrant outlier to a growing international understanding of what freedom of expression entails.

And Section II of [this paper](https://www.thefreelibrary.com/The+First+Amendment+in+Cross-Cultural+Perspective%3A+A+Comparative...-a0178535684) (PDF) finds considerable discrepancies between the legal foundations of free speech in the US and that of four other modern democracies (Canada, Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom).

On the other hand, Article 19 of the United Nations' [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/) attempts to set a common standard:

> Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.

So, is there an international legal consensus on how to define freedom of speech? In general, are there legal commonalities we see in other countries that value this freedom? Is the US legal view an outlier, and if so, in what ways?
