What recourse do the people of Hong Kong have in the event of Chinese central government intervention?
The [Hong Kong protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Hong_Kong_anti-extradition_bill_protests) that began over opposition to an anti-extradition bill have expanded to include citizens' fundamental grievances against the government and their insistence that Carrie Lam, the city's pro-Beijing leader, resign. The conflict in the streets has gotten severe enough that [several countries have issued travel advisories.](https://www.asiatimes.com/2019/08/article/us-issues-travel-warning-for-hong-kong/) 

China warns that [it will intervene](https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-warns-hong-kong-it-will-intervene-if-situation-deteriorates-11565182342) if local authorities are unable to quell the violence.

If the protests provide the impetus for China to send troops to Hong Kong, is that technically a breach of the ["one country, two systems" principle?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_country,_two_systems) If so, what recourse do those in support of Hong Kong's semi-autonomous state have? And what influence do countries like the UK, which handed back Hong Kong with the understanding that it would remain somewhat autonomous, have over the situation?
