ED: What's going on over there?
RITA: Everybody's making audition tapes for that Real TV thing.
JOHN: Oh, that thing. Yeah. Did you hear about this?
ED: Yeah, what - they put some schmuck on TV all day long or something?
RAY: You know, that would be like a great thing.
ED: What?
RAY: That! Being that guy. Being the guy they watch.
ED: What are you drunk?
RAY: Yeah, but let's stay on one subject. Whoever that person is is going to be famous. They'll be able to get whatever they want. They'll ... trust me, this is my business.
ED: What is?!
RAY: Show business.
ED: You're in show business?
RAY: Yeah. I service video equipment.
ED: That's like... those people stitching Nikes in Panama saying they're in the NBA.
RAY: I'm not stitching Nikes in Panama! ... Bedwetter!
ED: Thumbsucker!
RAY: I'm making a tape.
ED: We're excited.
