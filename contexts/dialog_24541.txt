SPATS: Hello, Charlie. Long time no see.
TOOTHPICK CHARLIE: What is it, Spats? What do you want here?
SPATS: Just dropped in to pay my respects.
TOOTHPICK CHARLIE: You don't owe me no nothing.
SPATS: Oh, I wouldn't say that. You were nice enough to recommend my mortuary to some of your friends...
TOOTHPICK CHARLIE: I don't know what you're talking about.
SPATS: So now I got all those coffins on my hands - and I hate to see them go to waste.
TOOTHPICK CHARLIE: Honest, Spats. I had nothing to do with it.
SPATS: Too bad, Charlie. You would have had three eights. Goodbye, Charlie!
TOOTHPICK CHARLIE: No, Spats - no, no, no - NO!
