Had 1st interview today and was told by senior recruiter she would schedule me for the 2nd round but just received automated rejection in email?
Do you think I got rejected for the second interview or was there a mistake? I just sent the recruiter a thank you email and tried to call but got voicemail. The recruiter said she would be reaching out either Monday or Tuesday to schedule me for the second round interview.

The email is pretty standard and says that the "leadership team" reviewed my background and found it didn't align.
