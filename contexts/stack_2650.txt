Calculating the area covered by a polygon feature within a buffer area of a point in QGIS I have two datasets - one of points from bird nesting data and one of the extent of woodland. I have created 2km buffers around each nesting point and I want to find out what area of woodland there is within each point buffer. Can someone point me in the right direction as to what process I use here?
