TOWNSEND: And what are you thinking we should do now?
MAYA: I've filed a report with Father Frank.
TOWNSEND: A lot of good that'll do.
MAYA: We need all the help we can get.
TOWNSEND: I've dealt with these people before, Maya. They're not going to help us.
MAYA: We'll see Father Frank in the morning. There's nothing to be done until then.
TOWNSEND: Alright, Maya. We'll do it your way.
