How to set the right tone as leader
Tomorrow I’m starting a new role as a supervisor. My team consist of four people. I’ve been a supervisor before but this is at a much bigger place and more layers into management. 

How do I set the tone for my first day? I want everyone to know I don’t want any drama or bulls*it around the office but I am willing to be there for them & I am a nice person.
