VIKTOR: Do I know you?
MAX: Max Sayer -- National Echo.
VIKTOR: Don't you have a real story to write? Why aren't you in Latin America?
MAX: This is the story.
VIKTOR: I remember when the Echo had class -- the paper that could bring down governments.
MAX: Our leaders aren't presidents anymore -- they're pop stars and screen idols. If Woodward and Bernstein were alive today, they'd be right here in Hollywood with me.
VIKTOR: They are alive, Sayer.
MAX: So they're probably here. You might be able to sell this 'disappearing act' to the rest of the world, but I'm not buying it. What's really behind this Simone woman? The public has a right to know. Why is she staying out of sight? And why the hell is she with you? I don't want you to take this the wrong way, Viktor, but you're not exactly Cecil B. DeMille -- more run-of-the-mill.
VIKTOR: Maybe the reason she's with me is a little thing called integrity, Sayer. Look it up.
