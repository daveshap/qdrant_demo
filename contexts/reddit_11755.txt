Cliche funny sad kid
I’ve been at uni a year now and I have began to feel so alone, all my friends are hours away and I don’t see them often. The friends I’ve made here at uni are nice and I like them but they’re not the same, despite being surrounded by people all the time like course mates and flat mates I still feel so alone. I want to have someone here with me to talk to about our problems. I want a hug. 

When my course mates ask me to go out, I say no (I have been out with them before tho), I feel bad because I feel like they think I don’t like them, the reason I don’t go out is because I don’t like drinking or clubbing. So whilst they’re out doing something I don’t enjoy, I’m in my room alone left to myself. It’s so hard to speak to anyone about this because I am quite talkative and love to make people happy, and the way I act is totally different to how I’m feeling.

Going to uni is like a job, they’re my colleagues, and as soon as I’m finished for the day I’m all alone
