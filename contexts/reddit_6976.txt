Recently Unemployed
Good morning all. As the title states, I am recently unemployed due to a corporate merger/acquisition with another firm and the necessary cuts made when this happens. Simply, my position was not needed at the new company, and they did not have any openings where I would have been a good fit. 

Here’s my dilemma: I’ve been in this industry (Transportation) since 2006, and it’s fair to say I’m not a rookie. It’s also fair to say that I am not qualified for an executive level position. In my area, however there are very few opportunities that are between entry level and executive level. This makes my job search a little extra challenging. 

For the first 10 years, I was a driver in various capacities and have been working on the admin side for the past 3 years as a broker, a dispatcher, and most recently a recruiter. I think it’s fair to say also that I’m well rounded in several aspects of the industry. I am not interested in going back into driving, unless that becomes absolutely necessary. 

Any advice that could be given as to finding the few openings that are in the middle ground, or perhaps other industries that I could transition to, would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance!
