Is this a good reply to a welcome to the company/team email?
Just received an email from a lady in HR with my boss, HR department, and others cc'd on it and wanted to know if this was a good response? I kind of copied something online. Any help appreciated:

"Thank you Gwen for your informative email. I'm very excited to be the new addition to the team.

This is a great opportunity to work for \*\*\*\*\* and I hope to contribute to it's success.

I look forward to working with you as well, thank you! "
