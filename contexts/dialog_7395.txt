LEX: Really, Trip, can we bore holes in your head and use it as a bong so it actually does us some good for a change?
TRIP: Fuck you, Lex! This whole thing wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for you jinxing us. I just made an honest mistake.
HAWK: Oh, I'm sorry, Trip. What you made was a big, brainless, pile of horse shit. No offense.
JAM: Guys, GUYS! Come on, if this is anyone's fault, it's mine. I was the one who grabbed Trip's jacket by mistake. It's my fault and I apologize.
HAWK: Please, Jam, we're trying to vent some hostility here. Sure the whole thing may be your fault, but who's gonna get pissed off at you?
