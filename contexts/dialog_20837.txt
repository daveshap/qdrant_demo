JACK: I knew him. Probably one of the few he knew him as William Turner. Most everyone just called him Bill, or 'Bootstrap' Bill.
WILL: 'Bootstrap?'
JACK: Good man. Good pirate. And clever -- I never met anyone with as clever a mind and hands as him. When you were puzzling out that cell door, it was like seeing his twin.
WILL: That's not true.
JACK: I swear, you look just like him.
WILL: It's not true my father was a pirate.
JACK: Figured you wouldn't want to hear it.
WILL: He was a merchant marine! He was a respectable man who obeyed the law, and followed the rules--
JACK: You think your father is the only man who ever lived the Glasgow life, telling folk one thing, and then going off to do another? There's quite a few who come here, hoping to amass enough swag to ease the burdens of respectable life. And they're all 'merchant marines.'
WILL: My father did not think of my mother -- his family -- as a burden.
JACK: Sure -- because he could always go pirating.
WILL: My father -- was not -- a pirate!
JACK: Put it away, Will. It's not worth getting beat again.
WILL: You didn't beat me. You ignored the rule of engagement. In a fair fight, I'd kill you.
JACK: Then that's not much incentive for me to fight fair, is it?
