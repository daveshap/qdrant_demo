What the heck is a 3-hour interview for and how do I conquer it?
Reddit Family,

I need advice on how to tackle and/or insight on 3-hour interviews? Are interviews this long normal in the workforce? My dream company is considering me for a role I’ve been wanting for quite sometime.  Any idea why they’re having me meet with 4 people, in 45-minute intervals rather than a simple panel interview? How do o keep my pre-prepared question list fresh—is it okay to ask each of them the same questions at the conclusion of each conversation? Looking forward the responses! TIA!
