Does anyone else feel like they have to commit suicide to get revenge on the people that hurt me, to tell the world I am not gonna put up with its crap, and to that I have to do it to ask the world to solve the problems I am facing for others?
I have been suicidal ever since my grandparents passed away several years ago. I don't have much family, I feel like I need to kill myself to escape that pain because it can't be solved because you can't bring dead people back from the dead, and I feel like if I kill myself I can leave a note to tell the world to solve this problem for others. I am estranged from the family I do have and I feel like I need to kill myself to let them know they have hurt me. I hate how I don't have a big family, lots of friends, don't have a good job or are rich, and don't get to go on vacations. People disrespect me. I feel like if I kill myself I can tell the world that I am not gonna put up with its unfairness. 

Would me commuting suicide and writing a detailed note change the world? 

I hate how people think of mental health issues when they think of suicide when they don't think of lonliness or lack of family casting it. 

I know some peopme say that family doesn't have to be blood but someone will always tell me when I say that "blood is thicker than water". Maybe this will tell the people that say that I won't put up with that bullcrap.
