My Miracle Acceptance
This might be a confidence booster for all of you out there with the low stats, low income, but high drive. 

I am an incoming college freshman. Before I tell you where I am going, here are my stats:

SAT: 1230
ACT: 25
GPA: 4.2

I came from a low income household, so much so to the point where I was supporting myself my last year of high school, working insane hours to pay for my college application fees, graduation cap and gown, etc. 

I hated school until I was in sophomore year, when a teacher told me if I didn't get my shit together, I wouldn't graduate. I started to study, and actually cared about the grades I got. The only access to a computer I had at the time was to the public library. I actually transferred high schools, because I wanted to become more academically driven at a college prep school (despite the rumors from classmates that I got expelled from my previous school). 

The highest job my mom ever held was a shift supervisor at Carl's Jr. The highest job my (long gone) dad ever held was a drug dealer. 

I worked 6 months prior on my essays to colleges, and worked so hard for my extracurriculars that I had 500+ hours of community service. 

I got rejected from these colleges: UC Davis, UC Irvine, UC Santa Barbara, UC Berkeley, Cal Poly SLO, San Diego State, Cornell, Brown, Stanford, USC. 

The three I got accepted to:

CSUN, Cal State Long Beach, **UCLA.**

I got accepted as a Biology major, and am attending this fall. So if you think you have a zero percent chance, that is bullshit. The college decisions are wack- of course you have a chance. 

So get started on those essays. They are what make you human in the admission process.


EDIT* i never thought this post would get this popular, holy crap. thank you all for your best wishes and congrats for me!!!! they are greatly appreciated and Go Bruins! :0)
