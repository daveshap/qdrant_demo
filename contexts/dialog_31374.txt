GRADY: New?
SARA: Walter just got it back from the framer today.
SARA: You go first.
GRADY: All right. This morning --
SARA: I'm pregnant.
SARA: I'm sure.
GRADY: Well. This is... surprising. Does Walter...?
SARA: I think Walter would find this a little more than surprising.
GRADY: Emily left me this morning.
SARA: She's left before...
GRADY: She's left the room before. She always came back.
SARA: So. I guess we just divorce our spouses, marry each other, and have this baby, right? Simple.
GRADY: Simple.
SARA: Is that Cristaile?
GRADY: Hm.
SARA: My God, I wear the same scent as a transvestite. She IS a transvestite, isn't: she?
GRADY: If she's not now, Terry will make sure she is by the end of the evening.
SARA: Has he asked to see the book yet?
GRADY: Yes.
SARA: And? Are you going to tell him?
GRADY: No. Maybe. I don't know. I don't know what I'm going to do.
SARA: Neither do I.
GRADY: Sara, my arm. I'm stuck, honey.
SARA: I guess you're going to have to chew it off then.
