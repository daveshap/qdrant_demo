PARRISH: -- What's the deal here? Are you going to be breathing down my neck right 'til the very end?
JOE: I don't understand.
PARRISH: ...I'd like to be alone for a while.
JOE: Are you sad, Bill?
PARRISH: Yes, I am. There's a research lib- rary on the fourth floor. Why don't you go down and read some magazines?
JOE: You're not thinking of going some- where, are you, Bill?
PARRISH: Joe, could I ask you to take a walk? Buy a tie or something. I know I'll be seeing you.
JOE: Of course.
PARRISH: Now I'd like to be alone.
JOE: Oh. Okay.
