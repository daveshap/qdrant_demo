I'm crying in relief.
It's payday today. Last week I started a second job to try to get a little more money to help ease my fear of being so broke I have to go back on the ramen only diet, twice a day. (That's where I was before I found this sub. Just ramen, no add ins.) 

I was told that even though I started mid-pay period that my first paycheck wouldn't be until next check. They were wrong. I had a deposit when I woke up this morning. 

I woke up Christmas morning and realized I would be short some hours on my paycheck because of holiday flight reduction (like 2 days/16hours short on my next check) and I panicked because that's when some of my larger bills are due. 

I also worried when first starting this job because I always fear I entered my direct deposit information wrong. 

It wasn't much, because I didn't have many hours when i started, but it was enough to ease my stress a bit. I'm just so excited and I needed to tell someone.
