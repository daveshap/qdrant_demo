How lax are public sector jobs about qualifications?
I work in public sector administration at the state level. I'm applying to better paying jobs closer to home in the public sector, and I've found a few that look like a perfect fit for me, as in they're exactly what I do at my current job, but higher paying and closer to home. Double win!

Only problem is they ask for 3 years of experience, and I'm sitting a few months shy of 2 years. I know the conventional advice is to apply anyways, you might get the job, and the qualifications are really just for the 'ideal' candidate. 

But in the state agencies I've worked in, they won't even consider you without meeting the minimum qualifications. As in they put everyone in a spreadsheet and filter by the minimum qualifications, and pick from the pool that meets it. So this leads me to believe in similar public sector jobs (city, county and ISD level) they might have the same process. Can anyone speak to the hiring practices they've seen at the different levels of public jobs?

These jobs are in small towns, so I believe my odds are great if they give me a chance, but these applications are exhausting and I don't want to throw myself at the wall for nothing.
