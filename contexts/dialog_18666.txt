SKIP: All right, I'm just gonna tell you, as simple and direct as I can. And you understand that this is a big secret? Just between us? Okay. You know I've got this gift for certain kinds of... machines.
MUMFORD: You are Panda, monarch of modems.
SKIP: That's right. And you also know that even though I make 23% of the modems in the world... I cannot make one simple connection with any woman who could truly love me.
MUMFORD: Okay... let's say that, for now.
SKIP: It's true, believe me. So... do you know what I've been doing, all alone, in my workshop, for almost two years?... Mr. Find-the-Need-and-Fill- It. How I spend my every solitary hour?
SKIP: Guess. Go ahead, guess!
MUMFORD: Jerking off?
SKIP: No!... Although that's a good guess. No, what I've been working on, what the world really needs and no one has been able to create -- -- a virtually life-like, humanoid, gender-specific, anatomically functional... sexual surrogate slash companion.
MUMFORD: Slash what?
SKIP: Sexual surrogate... slash... companion.
MUMFORD: A doll?
SKIP: No, Doc, not a doll. I am Panda. I'm talking about much, much more than a doll. The world has never seen what I'm talking about... except maybe in the movies.
MUMFORD: How's it coming?
SKIP: You don't think I'm insane?
MUMFORD: And that's your secret? You meant -- like a trade secret?
SKIP: No, Doc, a private secret! It's perverted, it's pitiful. What am I -- Dr. Frankenstein? Aren't you repulsed?
MUMFORD: Sounds like kind of a good idea.
SKIP: Really?
MUMFORD: Definitely.
MUMFORD: Skip, that's not much of a secret.
SKIP: It's not?
MUMFORD: Oh, it's okay. It's just not something to be ashamed of. Maybe you don't want people knowing -- and believe me, it's safe with me -- but on the scale of dirty little secrets, I'd give it, say... a two.
