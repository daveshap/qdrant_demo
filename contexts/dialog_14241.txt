GEORGE: Yes, sir.
POTTER: Have you notified the police?
GEORGE: No, sir. I didn't want the publicity. Harry's homecoming tomorrow . . .
GEORGE: No, sir. No, sir. I haven't.
POTTER: What is it –– a woman, then? You know, it's all over town that you've been giving money to Violet Bick.
POTTER: Not that it makes any difference to me, but why did you come to me? Why don't you go to Sam Wainwright and ask him for the money?
GEORGE: I can't get hold of him. He's in Europe.
POTTER: Well, what about all your other friends?
GEORGE: They don't have that kind of money, Mr. Potter. You know that. You're the only one in town that can help me.
POTTER: I see. I've suddenly become quite important. What kind of security would I have, George? Have you got any stocks?
