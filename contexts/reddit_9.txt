Everything’s changing
I’m 17 and a senior, so you probably have an idea where this is headed. I just came back from my last wrestling tournament with my team, which marked the end of my season. As I got home, I felt so exhausted mentally and physically. I threw my bags on the floor of my bedroom and plopped onto the bed while tears just rolled down my face. I realized that I really had a profound sense of attachment to my team and coaches. I feel like I lost a part of myself. But it wasn’t just a team, they were my family, I come from a broken home where I’m not wanted and everyday of school I’d look forward to wrestling practices. They were people who made me happy to feel alive and the thought that “this is the end of the line” really breaks my heart. I met my now-boyfriend on this team, I just don’t want to lose what I have right now. My boyfriend made me feel so special but I understand we have to go separate ways. Everyone having to move on and start living their own lives. Everything just seems to be falling apart and changing. I’m probably very childish for wanting to keep this sense of familiarity but these people made me feel loved and appreciated and I have this strong sense of love for these people as well. My heart feels so strained today, I just feel so lost and empty.
 This is more of a rant but I’d like some advice if possible.
