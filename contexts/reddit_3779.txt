So my attempt at getting back into the dating world just ended in the most spectacular way.
It's our third date, she offered to make me dinner at her place.  After dinner we were talking and cuddling on the couch.  We disagreed over something somewhat political, then she started insulting and berating me.  I eventually had enough and said "I am nowhere near emotionally invested enough in this relationship to fight this hard to make it work.  And honestly, I don't have to take this from anyone. " So I grabbed my coat and then when I went to open her front door she straight up punched me in the face.

So yea I think that's enough dating for me for the year.

**Edit**:  Had a few people ask what the argument was, so I've copied my other comment.

I had mentioned how a few people have told me I kinda looked like Obama. She got unreasonably angry and said how much she hated him. Her reaction threw me off so I decided to steer the conversation away from politics. She was too riled up by that point and said I "have a lot to learn" and "don't know anything about life". 

She's a bit older than me and this was the third time she had said something like that to me. I had already told her once already that it's extraordinarily rude to say shit like that to someone. So I said it again, only this time I added "I don't have to take this from you, or anyone for that matter". 

Then I put my jacket on and was halfway out the door and WHAM. 

I'm not a doctor or anything but I don't see how anything I said warrants that kind of behavior.

I think her anger might not have been so much about politics, she might just hate Obama because her ex husband also kinda looks like him too.
