I have 2 jobs, one company just bought the other. What should I do?
So as the title suggests, I have been working for my new company for a little over 4 months. We just got bought by the company I put on the back burner but am still an active employee at. I'm not sure if I should quit one because I never found out if there would be a conflict of interest with me working this other job or not.

The company I just started working for pays me more but I'm thinking that the old company that bought us will take over and my pay will be reduced based on that depending on which company I'm working for (if I continue working for company 1 my pay might become lower within company 2, unless I quit company 1). What should I do?
