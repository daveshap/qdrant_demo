OLD COWBOY: And you ain’t neither one of those damned Mexicans who end up littering the landscape after getting ripped-off by their friendly cross- border guides, are you, mister?
LOMBARD: No...
OLD COWBOY: I didn’t think so. The rags on their sorry backs are the only wordly possessions those wretched creatures are ever found with... I don’t wanna know who you are or how come you ended up roasting in Owl Canyon. But you might as well know I’d have let you fry to a buzzard meal if not for this...
OLD COWBOY: Now, can you stand up? Can you use your legs and stand up?
LOMBARD: I... How long have I been here?
OLD COWBOY: Three days and that’s three days too many.Come on. Get your ass up.
OLD COWBOY: Huh... I guess you ain’t quite ready for civilisation yet... I’ll give you one more day, a meal, and then you’re on your way.
LOMBARD: Los Angeles?
OLD COWBOY: Los Angeles is 100 miles away.
LOMBARD: I’d appreciate it if I could use your phone.
OLD COWBOY: I’m sure you would. But if I had one, I wouldn’t let you near it. Now you tuck back in and rest until you’re told otherwise. And for what it’s worth, I wouldn’t try anything that might be construed as unappreciative of my hospitality. I’d sooner shoot you than have you upset me...
OLD COWBOY: Barstow’s 30 miles to the left. Los Angeles a hundred to the right. Wherever you’re heading, I reckon somebody’ll pick you up.
LOMBARD: Huh... I suppose the idea of a one day trip to Los Angeles doesn’t appeal to you...
OLD COWBOY: Is that where lawyers toil for an industry that turns serial killers into heroes who give thrills to young women who write erotic novels about psychopaths and rapists? You go to your world, I’ll stay in mine. So long, Mister.
