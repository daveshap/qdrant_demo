LARA: Since right after we lost our son.
WITWER: You mean after he lost your son.
LARA: It was nobody's fault.
WITWER: But John was with him at the pool?
LARA: Yes.
WITWER: You said in your divorce papers that he tried to kill himself.
LARA: It wasn't a suicide attempt. I regret ever saying that.
WITWER: What was it then?
LARA: The FBI found something that belonged to my son. A sandal... Anyway, John was upset. He... he...
WITWER: He took out his gun and sat down to watch his home movies. This is all in your statement, Lara...
LARA: He shot a hole in the damn ceiling. So what? You lose your son, let's see how well you handle it.
WITWER: Not very well, I'm sure. I'd probably start doping myself. Or maybe I'd...
WITWER: Lamar Burgess thinks that you left John because he lost himself in Precrime instead of you.
LARA: I left him because every time I looked at him, I saw my son. Every time I got close to him, I smelled my little boy. That's why I left him. And now you can leave.
WITWER: You know I need to use you.
LARA: To what? Trap him?
WITWER: To prevent a murder. Sooner or later, he's going to contact you.
LARA: I haven't seen him in two years.
WITWER: But I've seen the three hundred hours of your image he's got stored away.
