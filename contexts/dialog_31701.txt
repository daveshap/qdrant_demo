INGA: Dr. Fronkonsteen -- look!
FREDDY: Whatever it is, it's coming from down there. I'm going down to see.
INGA: Let me come with you, Doctor, please! I don't want to stay up here alone.
FREDDY: All right then, quietly! Close your robe and stay right behind me. Don't make a sound!
FREDDY: Aye-gor!
IGOR: Fro-derick!
FREDDY: What are you doing here?
IGOR: I got frightened all alone upstairs, so I came down here.
FREDDY: But what you were doing?
IGOR: Just putting up some tea.
FREDDY: Did you hear that strange music?
IGOR: What?
FREDDY: Did you hear that strange music??
IGOR: What?
FREDDY: Did you hear that strange music?
IGOR: No, not sound.
INGA: There must have been someone else down here then.
FREDDY: It seems that way. You didn't hear any music at all?
IGOR: What?
FREDDY: You didn't hear... nothing! Aren't there any lights in this place?
IGOR: Two switches over there, but I wasn't going to be the first.
