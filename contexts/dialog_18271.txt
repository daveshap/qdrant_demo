OLD MAN: At dinner, my daughter-in-law threatened to kill me. Things are very bad in my house.
FELIX: Hurry up.
LUCY: Don't fight.
OLD MAN: If I hit the stick too hard, the apple will split. If I am too timid, the apple will fall off the stick.
FELIX: We're supposed to do fifty apples. We only got twelve done.
OLD MAN: I don't know what to advise my son. I think he should pay for the wedding, but it is important that he don't look ridiculous.
LUCY: Don't make yourself sick.
OLD MAN: Cosmo drank five glasses of wine at dinner.
LUCY: Talk to him.
OLD MAN: I will. But I must find the right moment.
LUCY: Did you see the moon last night?
OLD MAN: Yes!
FELIX: Hurry up, hurry up. We open in five minutes.
LORETTA: Bye, Aunt Rita.
RITA: Bye, bye, honey. See you tomorrow?
LORETTA: Yeah, I'll be in.
