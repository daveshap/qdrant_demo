I’ve posted twice about this, this is an update.
I broke up with my girlfriend, she was still stuck on her ex and was not investing into me as much as I was her.... she told me she wanted a break this week since she was at camp, but I came to my senses and I called it off, I can’t deal with that mentally and emotionally. Thank you those who gave me advice....
