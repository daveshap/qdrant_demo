CRAWFORD: But for Catherine Martin, it all comes down to you and Lecter. You're the one he talks to.
CLARICE: He's already offered to help... What would happen if we just showed our cards - asked him for Bill?
CRAWFORD: He offered to help, Starling, not to snitch. That wouldn't give him enough chance to show off. Remember, Lecter looks mainly for fun. Never forget fun.
CLARICE: But if he knew we have so little time -
CRAWFORD: If we act too anxious, he'll make us wait. He'll let the Senator keep hoping, day after day, until Catherine finally washes up. That'd be the most fun of all.
CLARICE: I think he means it, this time. I think he'll deal.
CRAWFORD: What would it take?
CLARICE: Transfer to a new prison. With a view of trees, he said, or even water... Can we swing that?
CRAWFORD: State to federal jurisdiction... We can do it - eventually - but we'll never get all the clearances in time. Can you convince him a deal's already in place?
CLARICE: You'll back me up with some paperwork? Then I'll try. But wouldn't this have more weight coming from the Senator herself?
CRAWFORD: She doesn't know what we're up to. And we can't afford to let her find out.
