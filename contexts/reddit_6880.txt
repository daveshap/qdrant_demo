Company went through layoffs. Now the people that are left are ‘working through their severance period’
As the title states, the company that I am with laid off a good portion of staff. The people that were just laid off got 60 days severance pay, and their PTO converted to hourly pay. 

I am one of the people that was retained. We were given WARN letters that basically said that we are closing May 13th. The company stated that we are essentially working through our severance period, and nothing further is promised after that. We are being told that there is a chance we will turn it around and the WARN letter will be amended. Privately, no one still here believes we will pull through, including several in or right beneath C-suite. I am under the assumption that I was retained to help liquidate assets. I feel I am being told that we might pull through this in order to keep me motivated to dump as much product as possible in this period.

Regardless, I can’t help but feel like the people that were simply laid off actually got the much better deal. I am now stuck here, filling multiple roles and have less time to look for a new job that I know I will soon need. Also, when I do get interviews, I will need to burn my PTO and will not get that paid out to me after we close. Do I have any recourse? I feel like I am being held hostage on a sinking ship. I am also hoping to use my boss and COO as references, so I can’t just walk out or get let go with cause. I don’t have the savings to do that either. 

Meanwhile, the people that were let go get paid severance, paid for their PTO and have two months completely free to look for a new job. Is there anything I can do?
