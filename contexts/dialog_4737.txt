WALLACE: M'lady... what kindness of you to visit a stranger.
PRINCESS: Sir, I... come to beg you to confess all, and swear allegiance to the king, that he might show you mercy.
WALLACE: Will he show mercy to my country? Will he take back his soldiers, and let us rule ourselves?
PRINCESS: Mercy... is to die quickly. Perhaps even live in the Tower. In time, who knows what can happen, if you can only live.
WALLACE: If I swear to him, then everything I am is dead already.
