She cheated on me
Yesterday I found out that my GF cheated on me with my best friend, he told me that she felt lonely and she felt sad while she was with me and they started talking and ...

She used to tell me that I complete her and that I make her the happiest girl on the planet...

She told me she wants to marry me, she wants to be with forever...

I bought her a ring and wanted to surprise her but the next thing I know was that she cheated on me...

Everything reminds me of her, I can't do something without crying, without imagining they say I love you to each other...

I feel like the whole world is collapsing on me and that this is the end of the line for me, what have I done to deserve this, she told me I treat her like a princess, I went way out of my way to make her happy, I did everything I could do but this is what she did to me.

I just don't want to be alive, I don't want any of this pain anymore...
