I have a concern
Hello, I'm a 17 year old girl who had just graduated from a secondary school. I recently finished taking an important exam which majority of 17 year old students have to take. People said that our future is depending on the exam. We'll get good jobs if our results is good. But that is not my concern yet. My concern is that the result will be out around 3 or 4 months after the exam and those months are usually the time when students who took the exam search part time jobs. I would like to experience a part time job myself but my parents are against it. When I asked why, I don't really get a satisfactory response. Some reasons that they mention was how am I going to work everyday (transportation) and I won't even get that much money from working a part time job. They said it's better for me to look for something that I like and build skills from that. For example taking classes, etc. The thing is, those classes require fees and I feel bad to keep asking money from my family. Everytime I want something, I have to ask money from my father or mostly my brother. Of course they'll give it to me but I just can't help but to feel bad for them. The reason why I want to work is because I want to have at least some pocket money that I earned by myself. Maybe in a few months, I will continue my studies in a university and I can't expect my father to pay for all of my expenses. I do think that taking extra class would be nice, I do like arts and I want to learn how to paint but those classes mostly cost a fortune. Actually I have a lot more things to explain but I don't want to make this too lenghty. So, my concern is.. What should I do? Take a class or convince my parents to allow me to get a job?
