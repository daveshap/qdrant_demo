EMMA: Such as?
VALENTINE: Destruction of their local weather systems. I can zap a thousand Chernobyls into the air.
EMMA: The result would be ...
VALENTINE: Chaos. Transport paralysis. Crop failure. Economic disaster. Frostbite or sunburn ... on a massive scale. You've seen a few samples...
EMMA: Then what's stopping you?
VALENTINE: One very small thing. A diamond 'cyclone' chip. A thousand times more information on a fraction of the size. If I possess that, my powers would be unlimited. My dear half-brother was developing it. But he suspected sabotage. He gave the chip to ... you, 'Mrs.' Peel. I want you. But also your ring.
VALENTINE: The missing piece of the jigsaw. I tried to get you to give it to me as Peter; I tried to steal it from you as Dr. Darling. As myself I'll be a bit less subtle. With this ring my plan will be complete.
EMMA: How Wagnerian ... Do you mean to say you've waited all these years because you couldn't create a chip on your own? That would have amused Peter.
VALENTINE: Speaking of Peter, there's more good news: You won't even have to change your last name. You'll always be Mrs. Peel.
EMMA: What are my choices?
VALENTINE: Choices?
EMMA: I'll never marry you.
