KIRK: Mr. Sulu...? ... Mr. Sulu?!
SULU: ... Aye sir...?
KIRK: What is our condition?
SULU: Sir... Braking thrusters seem to have fired.
KIRK: Picture, please.
KIRK: Earth... But when?... Spock?
SPOCK: Judging by the pollution content of the atmosphere, I believe we have arrived at the late 20th Century.
KIRK: Well done, Mr. Spock.
UHURA: Admiral, I am receiving whale songs.
KIRK: On speakers.
KIRK: Home in on the strongest signal. Descend from orbit.
SPOCK: Admiral, if I may: we're probably already visible to the tracking devices of the time.
KIRK: Quite right, Spock. Mr. Chekov, engage cloaking device!
