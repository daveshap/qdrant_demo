(Even if you're not writing a mundane essay, you can bring those same components into your own essay).

# Activities Section:

novembrr's activities series is so useful:

* [Stuck on your activities list? Novembrr can help.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/6uig01/stuck_on_your_activities_list_novembrr_can_help/) (Comment replies give helpful examples of how to phrase ECs)
* [How to write your Common App and UC Activities Lists](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/6lx32y/how_to_write_your_common_app_and_uc_activities/)
* [What you should do if you have no ECs](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/6eg8jq/what_you_should_do_if_you_have_no_extracurricular/)

u/MrsScholarGrade's series is new, and I hope I'll be adding more of her great work:

* [What counts as an EC, anyway?](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/cls7c1/faq_what_counts_as_an_ec_anyway/)
* [Activities and Awards: Making the Most of Your Character Count](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/cky9bl/activities_and_awards_making_the_most_of_your/)

[This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/bydczc/list_of_competitions_and_programs_to_pursue_to/) links several resources to find competitions/programs for your ECs or to find ECs based on your academic interest! I don't think you should be basing your activities on prestigious awards, but if you *are* doing something and you want to find ways to get more involved or get rewarded, this is a good resource.
