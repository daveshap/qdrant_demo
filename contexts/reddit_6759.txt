I hate writing cover letters!!!
Ugh. I know this post will sound defeatist but.. I hate writing cover letters. Who doesn't? I imagine more interesting and accomplished people than me probably won't bat an eye when asked to submit a cover letter.

I'm an engineer with \~2 measly years of experience, wanting to get into more project managerial/consulting roles, and when I'm writing these cover letters I sound so generic and DRY.

Like, yep, I see your company does XYZ things. I wouldn't say I'm passionate about what your company does, but I know I could do a good job in the said role. But I'm supposed to "sound" passionate about this industry. And I just can't artificially create that passion, so I'm gonna write a basic line indicating that I care. Oh, and this is what I've done in my current role. You know, so you can see that I'm at least, somewhat competent.

Honestly, I wish I was in the creative sector so I could write more ornate letters. I feel like when I'm writing CLs for more analyst positions, I struggle with choosing a dry vs. not dry tone. So I choose dry. I could spend 2-3 more hours researching issues in this industry and writing a college-like essay of how I find this specific issue in this industry interesting. But I don't have the time. Job searching is a numbers game, remember?

Maybe this is a unique problem. All I know is that I just want a job in this specific role because it seems cool and I like having varied work. That's it.
