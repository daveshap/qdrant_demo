How to keep going after so many rejection letters?
Sorry if this seems rambly, ranty and stream of conscious, but I just need to get this off my chest.

Since the end of February I have had 10 job interviews, however each time I keep getting the standard:

*"It is clear that you have some fantastic skills and experience. Unfortunately, at this stage, we will not be proceeding with your application as there were candidates that more closely matched what we are looking for at this particular time."*

I am young and enthusiastic and willing to get my hands dirty to get the job done right, I can think on my feet and work well on my own or with others.

I honestly wish I knew what I was doing wrong. What are they looking for? Is it experience? I have that in droves. I've done classes, I've done work experience and I've done unpaid work. Is it confidence? I admit new situations throw me for a loop but I bounce back pretty quickly.

I am at a loss and just seeing the same things in my inbox over and over and over again is really making me question myself as not only an adult but as an individual.

Thank you for reading.
