Learning the difference between a situation that needs communication and a situation that's a sign things just won't work out saves everyone a lot of time!
I think the first thing you should do when you're dating or in a relationship with someone and something is bothering you you should communicate and find a way to fix the problem. This should be the first step because realistically a lot of dating problems can be fixed with more mindfulness and intentionality by all parties involved.

BUT **there is a difference between an issue that just requires some communication and effort from both parties and an issue that is just a testament to how much two people should not be together.** Sometimes they are just not into you and/or vice versa and no amount of communication will fix that fact.

Someone that is into you will listen, speak on their side of the issues, and encourage you to work with them to find a middle ground, compromise or solution because to them, being with you is something they value and enjoy and see most problems trying to impede that as worth fixing. You will both make attempts to meet each other's needs.

With someone who is not into you, you will feel the need to communicate the same exact issue again and again and you'll be met with either verbal promises that never actually materialize, or they will react negatively to seemingly natural requests, e.g lashing out and making you feel bad for bringing a reasonable request up, or they'll just ignore it.

I'm sharing this as someone who learned it the hard way.

TL/DR: Pay attention to how people respond to your needs and how you respond to theirs. Sometimes "They're just not that into you" and it will not work out is the only conclusion.
