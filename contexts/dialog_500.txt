ANNA: When do you have to go back?
SANDRO: I don't know... It depends on Ettore... He's now in the process of negotiating for a contract here in Sicily...
ANNA: Then how come you're not with him?
SANDRO: What a question... Because I want to be with you, naturally. I hope he doesn't close the deal so he'll leave me alone at least for a few days... Isn't this water wonderful!
ANNA: I'd like to find a place where I can get some peace and rest, maybe around here somewhere. I'd like to try...
SANDRO: What could be more restful than this?... Excuse me, what is it that you want to try?
GIULIA: Where is she going?
SANDRO: Ask her.
