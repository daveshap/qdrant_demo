Indoor gardening explained. Grow your own food with little effort and money!
Heyo fellow users! Spring is upon us in the northern hemisphere and I would like to make a post about ways for us to grow our own food. I am currently on SNAP so I know the difficulty of getting yourself fed and would like to share some knowledge I have. 

Basically, for $4 you could have 3 tubs of 2-4 (Min of 6. Max of around 12) plants each that in the first stage of fruition would yield you more than your money back. 

Disclaimer here; I do not claim to be a professional by any means, my knowledge comes from having parents that grew and canned their own food for generations and a mother who grew up in intense poverty (If they didn't grow their food, they didn't eat. This is post depression ((USA)) era poverty might I add.) 

I will be splitting this up into two segments, the first being basics to get started. The second, some protips I've found out over the years. 

**The Basics of Indoor Gardening**

*If you would like to purchase seedlings skip to the next section*

* **Let's start out with your seeds!** The cheapest I have ever found seed packets were 3 for $1 at the Dollar Tree. Sometimes you can snag a deal on packets at Walmart for a few cents cheaper. I **DO NOT** recommend Lowe's or Home Depot for seeds, they are usually overpriced. You can also find Plastic tubs to keep your plants in at Dollar Tree for a buck each.

* On to tubs to hold your plants in. I find anything plastic or metal that is around 2ft in length will hold 1-2 fully mature plants. 

* Soil? You can get it for free! If you have any wooded area's near you feel free to go with a trash bag and shovel. You can cut an old milk jug at a 45 degree angle to make a DIY scoop to get the soil quicker, don't be afraid to get your fingers dirty breaking the top layer of soil! If you prefer to get higher quality soil you are welcome learn composting or to purchase a bag from any store that sells it. 

* **This is a very important thing to remember** You will have the healthiest plants if you start with seedlings and later transfer to larger pots. For seedling holders, use any old yogurt cup, used solo cup, small paper cups, old mason jars from pasta sauce (I don't fully support using glass jars or your own plastic drinking cups. We'll get to that later) etc. Sprinkle 2-4 seeds 2-4in deep in the soil of your holder and set them by your windowsill or on a shady area of your porch. Water as directed and bring inside whenever there is inclement weather or intense heat. Allow these to grow til their second set of leaves sprout, that is the best rule of thumb to let you know when to transplant them.  

**Planting your seedlings**

* Once you have your seedlings matured, tubs and soil, cut the holder along one side and gently place the seedling (soil and all) into a hole dug just an inch or two deeper than the seedling's soil. Group 1-2 seedlings together at least 3in from the edge of the tub. Why group a couple together? Because not all seedlings are promised to mature. Then repeat this the recommended length apart from one another. A good rule of thumb I've found is about 5in will be perfect for most any plant regardless of the packet's directions. 


**Now you've got your seedlings in their forever home!**

 Okay now I have some baby plants in a bin, what next? 

* Next we will place our tubs of seedlings near a window, if your room is painted any variant of white (Cream, tan, etc.) you can place your plants just slightly out of the sunlight due to light reflecting off of the walls, for example; on your kitchen table, nightstand in bedroom or end table in living room. Feel free to put a surface next to a window to give it the most light possible. 

* Now is the easier part in my opinion. Water your plants as needed. Simply keep your packets handy to reference to amount of water needed for each plant. I keep mine on my fridge with the name of the plant taped to the tub so I don't forget.

* Be patient! Your plants will grow with some good tlc and time. I suggest pruning dead or dry leaves to keep their nutrients in and rotating your plants whenever you notice they are leaning towards the light. 

* Pow! In a few weeks/months you will have produce to eat!


**Protips For Growing**

* Some plants such as tomatoes will need a little helping hand for their vines to grow accordingly, Place a stick per seedling next to their leaves so they have some support to carry their fruit later. 

* If you spot any light specs on your leaves that are not natural to their standard coloring your soil is too acidic, if you can get some wood to burn (even just some small sticks) spread ashes in the soil to correct the Ph balance. 

* Position your sunshine loving plants to the north for all day sunshine.

* Growing indoors is a good way to protect your plants for pests and diseases.

* Don't wan't to pay for seeds? If you're already buying organic produce you can take the seeds out of the produce and plant them. 

* Composting is a whole different post in and of itself but, if you can compost you can have amazingly nutritious soil for basically nothing.

* Try to keep your home around 70 degrees for optimal growth of most plants, anything lower than 60 will slow their growth or possibly kill them. Most homes are around 70 in most months of the year. 

* **Not all plants have to be grown as separate seedlings, you can directly plant some seeds. Usually vegetables can be directly sown from seeds. A quick google search will tell you if you can.**

* You can grow any plant out of season with the right conditions indoors. 

* **My favorite tip, place plants in your bathroom. When you shower the steam will water the plants for you**

* During the winter keep plants away from windowsills 

* **Don't have time to water your plants? Make a self watering pot by poking holes on the neck of a plastic bottle, screw the cap on and the soil will absorb water when needed.** You can also put plant nutrients in the water for extra benefits.

* If you have florescent light bulbs installed in your home they will benefit low to medium range lighting plants. Red wavelength light is best for bringing plants to fruition if you do not have much natural light (Search incandescent light bulbs).  

* **Set aside the seeds from your best veggie/fruit to grow your next plant free**

Hope this helps! If it wasn't for my indoor garden I wouldn't have had anything more than rice and beans to eat at least a week out of the month. 

Edit: Again, I am by no means a professional, but I felt it would be worthwhile to take the time to write this to give people a starting point for growing indoors. There are always better ways to grow produce than how I listed, I grow my own plants on a larger scale than this. This post is meant to be a starting point for someone looking to grow their own food, not a gospel truth.

Edit 2: thank you so much to the person who have me gold! I will be doing a part 2 with more tips that I know and that the redditors of this thread have offered as well as easy starter plants for beginner's to grow. The post should be up this evening!
