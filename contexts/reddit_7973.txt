Hiring freeze, funding and the pandemic.
Background: I just finished up the first year of my MS in Biomedical Engineering. My program is set up so that the first year is all coursework and unfunded and the second thesis year is all research and funded by your advisor. 
I identified an advisor and have spent the first year working (for course credit) in their lab to “prove” myself before they’d take me on for my thesis  year. I confirmed that they’d have funding and would take me on for the second year a few weeks ago. 

Problem: In filling out the necessary paperwork, the advisor found out that the university wide hiring freeze means students can only be hired if their stipend/tuition award will be covered under a previously awarded external funding source. My advisor has applied for an external grant but is unsure that it will be awarded this year because of the financial impact of the pandemic. As a backup, they had planned to use the department’s discretionary fund, but learned that it is also likely to be cut. 

Question: My goal in completing this MS is to prepare myself to apply for MD/PhD programs in biomedical engineering. I have four years of research in undergrad with one publication and numerous conference presentations, but not in BME. Will finishing out this MS without a thesis look bad, or should I shell out an extra $45,000 to pay for the second year myself? Are there other options I haven’t thought of?
