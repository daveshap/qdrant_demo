Feeling guilty and Tired of looking for helps
(I think) I've felt depressed since 2 years because of study, family, relations, future work, etc.

Wednesday 8, I posted a thing here and was given some advice (thank you) 

Friday 10, I decided to go to the hospital. And I was admitted right away.

Still, during the hospitalisation that lasted 10 days, I didn't feel better.

They treated me with Valium and then started antidepressant Monday after admission.

Now I'm back home, with my own depressive habits.

I don't want to talk everyone around me, even my best friend because I'm feeling guilty of being their burden.

It seems that I repeated everything to everyone over and over again. Every time I've talked about myself is even causing me more depression but still with no solution... 

Reaching for help is very tiring for me. And I'm tired of this shit in my head right now. I just want to get back to my work and be happy with everyone around me.
