My dog is getting put down tomorrow and I'm not able to comfort him.
My dog is getting put down tomorrow due to being aggressive. He but my brother's hand because the dog was in a fight with another dog and my brother got caught in the middle. Oden is a sweet dog and I don't want him to be put down. I want the other dog gone. The other dog, atlas, is the reason for all of this. Oden and atlas never got a long. They are always growling at each other. And not that oden is being put down, I am not going to be able to be in the same room as him because I have school. It's getting really tough because my dad, who oden is terrified of, is going to be taking him to the vet. I don't want him to die scared.
