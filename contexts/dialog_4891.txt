BLAIR: It's Aaron.
JANE: Yes?
AARON: I think the pilot that shot down the Libyan in 1981 is stationed right here. Maybe you could get him -- and maybe Tom should say that our F-14 is one of the hardest planes to fly. They're nicknamed 'Tomcats'.
JANE: Thanks. The F-14 is one of the most difficult planes to master. Oh, you call them 'Tomcats' and in the 70's the first crop had a number of crashes.
