ALEX: Let me go now, you'll make me late.
DAVID: Do me an enormous favor?
ALEX: Anything.
DAVID: Tell me that it's silly of me to be apprehensive.
ALEX: It's silly of you to be apprehensive.
DAVID: Werewolves simply do not exist.
ALEX: David, do you want me to stay here tonight?
DAVID: Yeah, I do, but go to work.
ALEX: Listen, if you get too anxious, call me at the hospital, okay?
DAVID: Okay.
ALEX: I've left those pills for you.
DAVID: A doper werewolf.
ALEX: I'm off. There's food in the fridge.
DAVID: See you later.
