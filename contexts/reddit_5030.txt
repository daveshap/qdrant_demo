I'm a male and I want to work as a secretary. Am I blackballed?
 

I am a male college graduate who was never able to break into the area I majored in, and six years later, I'm ready to try a different route. While I can do physical labor (I currently do), I would prefer to work in an office type environment in a secretarial type position. I know full well that this is not normal for men, but this would be much easier for an introvert such as myself. From what I have read, men tend to get screened out of such positions. This is technically illegal according to my understanding but impossible to prove. Is there any way I can break through this barrier?

Edit: I'm technology proficient and can type 80-85+ WPM. There's really no reason I shouldn't at least be getting a shot.
