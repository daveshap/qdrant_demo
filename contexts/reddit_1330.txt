Does anyone else wonder how different their life would be if they didn't grow up with anxiety and depression?
I can't help but think of all the opportunities I have missed or passed on because of my anxiety. I know I would have a much better job. I've been offered promotions but passed them up because thinking of the responsibilities put me into a  panic attack. I've also missed out on so many travel opportunities because of my anxiety. I know I probably shouldn't think about what could have been but sometimes I can't help think about it.
