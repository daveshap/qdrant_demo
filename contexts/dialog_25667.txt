CARMEN: He just got accepted to the Fleet Academy. Isn't that great ?
JOHNNY: Yeah, sure, I guess.
CARMEN: No, I mean if he can get in, maybe I have a chance.
JOHNNY: What are you talking about ? We both know you're gonna be a pilot.
CARMEN: Zander is going for pilot, too.
JOHNNY: You two have so much in common.
CARMEN: Johnny Rico, you're jealous !
JOHNNY: I can't help it.
CARMEN: He's nothing like you.
JOHNNY: I don't even know if you're my girl.
CARMEN: Are you the boy for me ?
JOHNNY: I'm gonna do it, Carmen. I'm gonna sign up for Federal Service.
