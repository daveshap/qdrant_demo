LILLIAN: And here's one from nice Mr. Zeiss. He says that...
FRANCES: Why are these all opened?
LILLIAN: Well, they needed immediate answers, Frances. It's good manners and good sense. You shouldn't be bothering yourself with these right now.
FRANCES: Then why did you bring them?
LILLIAN: It's your fan mail, little sister.
FRANCES: You kill me, Mama.
LILLIAN: What?
FRANCES: Go on...
SYMINGTON: ...I'm sorry to keep you waiting, the staff review ran over. Did you enjoy your mother's visit?
FRANCES: Yes. It was very good to see her.
SYMINGTON: Really? Any problems?
FRANCES: Not at all. She brought me my fan mail. I had no idea there were so many strangers concerned about me. But I guess that's the best thing about working in the movies. You make so many friends. I want to go back and show them that the faith they put in me wasn't a mistake.
SYMINGTON: You're telling me you feel guilty.
FRANCES: No... What I mean is... I'm just very excited by the prospect of getting on with my life, that's all.
SYMINGTON: Do you really believe your mother's trying to kill you?
FRANCES: What?
SYMINGTON: She told me you said, Mama
FRANCES: I never said... Oh look. That's just a figure of speech. She said something funny, and I said...
SYMINGTON: And you accused her of tampering with your mail.
FRANCES: Oh for Christ's...
FRANCES: I'm sorry. She misunderstood, that's all.
SYMINGTON: But you tell me you had a pleasant visit and your mother says you were sullen and uncommunicative. Whom do you think I should believe?
FRANCES: Doctor, I hate to break this to you, but my mother is a little batty.
SYMINGTON: Frances, you're still filled with anxiety. You feel guilty and hostile toward your family and friends. Consequently, I didn't recommend your release at the staff review.
FRANCES: You what?
SYMINGTON: Mental illness is an elusive thing, and though I'm pleased you're feeling more... capable, it's perhaps unrealistic to expect you to be completely cured after so short a time. Don't you agree?
SYMINGTON: I'm sure you'll see it my way in the end.
FRANCES: Dr. Symington, how big is your dick?
SYMINGTON: Huh?
FRANCES: 'Cause if it's long enough, which I doubt, why don't you wrap it around and fuck yourself in the ass!
FRANCES: I want outta here, you understand? I'm ready to get out! So you go back there... you go back and you tell them to let me out!
SYMINGTON: Frances, I'm warning you...
FRANCES: No, I'm warning you! Who do you think you are, God? You bumble around with your folders... ...and your pencils... ...and your god-damn buttons... ...all your badges of authority! But you have no authority! You're nothing! You're a zero!
