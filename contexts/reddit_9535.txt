I've gone the whole week without buying fast food!
My school has a Subway and a Starbucks on campus and a Wendy's right across the street from campus. On Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, I have class from 5 pm until 9:40 pm. To put it mildly, I was spending way way too much money at Subway for dinner or grabbing a quick coffee at Starbucks because "oh it's only $5!" Or grabbing Wendy's because their 4 for $4 was enough to last me two whole meals. 

So I made a bet with myself. I only had classes on Monday and Tuesday of this week. And yeah, it was hard. That Starbucks was sooo tempting. But I stayed strong! I haven't spent ANY money on fast food since last Friday! Granted, Thanksgiving being on Thursday and having enough leftovers to last me until Monday or so has helped, but I am kinda proud of myself. My roommate has complained all week about being hungry and wanting fast food and I didn't cave in and offer to run to McDonald's for her. I've essentially cleaned out our small pantry and "shopped" our freezer to make my meals before the feast was had on Thursday. 

On Tuesday I'll go grocery shopping and try to go all of next week without buying out. It's a small victory but dang, I'm proud of myself for it.
