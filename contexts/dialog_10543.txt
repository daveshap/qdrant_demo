BEAR: You see the paper?
BO CATLETT: I seen it, but I don't believe it. Says Harry shot Ronnie five times. Four to the chest and one through his foot.
BEAR: His foot. Jeez, poor Ronnie...
BO CATLETT: Yeah, I'm really gonna miss him.
BO CATLETT: Listen, tonight, later on, I got one for you doesn't involve any heavy work. I want you to go have a look around Chili Palmer's hotel room.
BEAR: I can't. I got to take Farrah to Satan's place down in Costa Mesa.
BO CATLETT: Who?
BEAR: Her mother. Not that it matters because I don't work for you no more. I quit. I just wanted to come by, tell you to your face so there's no misunderstanding.
BO CATLETT: Whoa... This is the man used to jump offa high buildings?
BEAR: Into air bags. There's no cushion under what you're doing. I'm out of it, Cat. I'm done.
BO CATLETT: Bear. The Colombians are in L.A. Seems they all upset about their money. That ain't enough, as a bonus, it turns out the yoyo was Escobar's nephew.
BEAR: That's your problem. You shouldn't've smoked the guy.
