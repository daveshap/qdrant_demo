I’m tired of hearing “If you’re not happy when you are single, you won’t be happy when you are in a relationship.”
Just because someone wants a relationship doesn’t mean that they are unhappy with how life is currently.

Humans are social creatures and as such we crave connection and intimacy with other humans.

I’ve never had a girlfriend myself so I put a lot of effort into OLD (even though it’s been a waste thus far). I’m happy with my life, I have a circle of close friends, many acquaintances and a good support system in my family. That being said there are many things you get from a significant other that you can’t get from friends or family. There are also many experiences that you miss out on.

I’ve seen what a significant other can do for my friends, they carry themselves a little differently and there’s a sparkle in their eye.

Just because I want to experience that for myself doesn’t mean that I am *unhappy* with my life. It means that I’ve seen what a significant other can *add* to your life and I would like to experience sharing my life with someone.

Sure, there are people out there who base their happiness on their relationship or lack thereof and those people need to work on themselves.
