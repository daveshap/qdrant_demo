Is it reasonable to apply to a Ph.D. program in business right after graduating with a master's degree?
Not sure if this is the best sub to post this in, please let me know if this question would better fit elsewhere.

I'm in a master's program now for an MBA. It was recently recommended to me that I look into furthering my education with a Ph.D. so that I could "have my pick of jobs."

I was just wondering if anyone here has gone on to get a Ph.D. (specifically in business) before actually working for larger companies? I always thought the typical process was to get a job first to gain "experience" and later on get a Ph.D. once you have more on your resume.

Let me know your thoughts, anything is appreciated and other disciplines please give me your input! Thanks so much.
