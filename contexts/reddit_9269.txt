Finally have $1,000 in savings
Just needing to tell someone who will be as excited as I am about this. I’m a full time college student and also working 35 hours a week. I started a new job in January and my goal was to put $1,000 in savings by January 2019. It’s only September and I feel so relieved. Thanks y’all for the motivation and advice posts! Happy saving!!
