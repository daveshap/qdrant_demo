CLARENCE: Sweetheart, write down your former address.
ALABAMA: What?
CLARENCE: Write down Drexl's address.
ALABAMA: Why?
CLARENCE: So I can go over there and pick up your things.
ALABAMA: No, Clarence. Just forget it, babe. I just wanna disappear from there.
CLARENCE: Look, sweetheart, he scares you. But I'm not scared of that motherfucker. He can't touch you now. You're completely out of his reach. He poses absolutely no threat to us. So, if he doesn't matter, which he doesn't, it would be stupid to lose your things, now wouldn't it?
ALABAMA: You don't know him -
CLARENCE: You don't know me. Not when it comes to shit like this. I have to do this. I need for you to know you can count on me to protect you. Now write down the address.
