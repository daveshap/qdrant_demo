EXLEY: Miss Bracken, I'm Lieutenant Exley.
LYNN: I know who you are. You're the policeman Bud told me about.
EXLEY: Really? What did White say?
LYNN: He said you were smart. He also said you were competing with your dead father. How did he put it? Trying to measure up to a ghost.
EXLEY: Let's concentrate on my smarts. Pierce Patchett made you, didn't he? He taught you how to dress and talk and think and I am very impressed with the results. But I need some answers and if I don't get them, I'm going to take you and Patchett down.
LYNN: He can take care of himself and I'm not afraid of you. And you forgot one thing, Lieutenant. Pierce also taught me how to fuck... Can I get you a drink?
