17 yr old with Associates Degree
Hello! I am currently 16, but I am projected to earn my associates degree by 17. I am going to transfer into college in 2020. I currently work, but I was wondering how big a factor my associate degree will be in the workforce when Iâ€™m in college applying for jobs at 17. Will they forgive my age because of the degree?
