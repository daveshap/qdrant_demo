SHELLY: Hi.
JUDY: Hi, is Vada home?
SHELLY: Yes she is, but she's very upset, so she's not seeing anyone.
JUDY: Oh, I'm Judy, I go to school with her, I wanted to tell her I'm sorry about Thomas J.
SHELLY: Well maybe she'll feel better in a couple of days.
JUDY: Will you tell her I came by?
SHELLY: Sure.
JUDY: Thank you. Bye.
SHELLY: Bye.
