GALLAGHER: Well, you're not getting your play done, but you're certainly covering a lot of territory.
STEW: Haven't I covered some territory? It feels like I've been on a Cook's Tour[18] some place.
GALLAGHER: Stewart, have you ever been to Old Madrid?
STEW: Been where?
GALLAGHER: To Old Madrid.
STEW: Never even been to New Madrid.
GALLAGHER: Then how do you expect to write about it?
STEW: Oh - draw on my imagination, I suppose.
GALLAGHER: Did Conrad draw on his imagination?
STEW: Did who?
GALLAGHER: Conrad.
STEW: What do you know about Conrad?
GALLAGHER: I don't know a thing about him, but isn't he the one you're always yelling about?
