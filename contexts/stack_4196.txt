Storing 200TJ of Electricity for rapid discharge Here's the problem I'm having.I need a solution for the following situation.I have a sci-fi starship drive that needs 140TJ of energy every 6 hours.I have a Fusion Reactor that can produce 200TJ in that time period.The problem is the Reactors produces 10GW... so I need to store this charge somewhere for when it is used. That means I need a Battery or a suggested \"Burst Circuit\"... I can't figure out which is the better method of storage.I can't figure out how a burst circuit would work as it seems like a 200TJ charge going around in a loop would burn awfully hot and destroy the circuit rapidly and also the rapid drop in Energy then reheated would damage it too. The problem with the Battery solution is that I don't how big the battery would be, and I'm pretty sure a battery can't discharge such high energy at once.So which is the better method or is there a better one? Can the Burst Circuit be done with current tech? How big would the battery be?
