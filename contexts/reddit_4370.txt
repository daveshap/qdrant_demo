I'm just tired of "improving" myself
Everyday I wake up, take a morning walk, do some exercises, work out, try eating healthily, talk to internet strangers, make friends here and there and so on and so forth. What's the point of all that. I'm not happy at all, despite everyone saying that working on myself will make me feel some sort of accomplishment. I don't. Yes, I guess I'm more healthy than ever before. But that's not what I'm after. That's not my passion or anything.

I like doing various alone-things like playing video games or daydreaming because I'm an introvert. But I'm also lonely. I could go out and meet some people. But I'd have to force myself out there, put on some fake happy face and make friendships that won't hold because either A. I would have to maintain a false personality, forget that I'm an introvert and just go out there every fucking time someone wants to meet up and do something I will not enjoy or B. go on about my introverted life but in return people will just abandon me, as they tend to do because there's a lack of common interests in the end.

The only real friends who genuinely get me are internet friends sitting somewhere on the other edge of the world. But those friends hit so much different than local friends. And, honestly, I think I'm even perfectly fine with my current friends situation. I just want someone to tell "I love you" to and the typical relationship stuff, but it's kinda hard finding someone compatible if I prefer staying home and cutting myself off of people. Dating apps? Fuck that, no luck there either. I understand you don't "need" that to survive and I could probably find some other purpose in life but this certain void in my heart will never be filled. And I can't just forget about it either.

Thank you for reading this. Apparently venting a bit to internet strangers helps for an hour or two, so there's that.
