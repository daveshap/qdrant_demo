Do I need a VPN to play AOE2 on the same LAN? Trying to setup AOE2 HD game in order to play over LAN. I have several laptops connected via wi-fi by using home router. I create game on first laptop and trying to connect from another one. Second laptop not finds first one hosted game. I suppose since I play on LAN, I don't need any additional tools like VPN in order to connect PC's. Please, correct me if I'm wrong.I was trying to run this game on two vmware virtual machines hosted on same PC. These machines connects to each other fine fine.Can I somehow tell AOE2 first machine IP dress in order to find served game?How to connect client AOE2 to server one?UPDFirewall is off on both PC's and ping works fine in both ways.UPD2I have connected laptop and third desktop pc for battle in case both of them are on LAN wire connection. In case laptop is on wifi and destop on LAN wire connection fails even ping both ways runs fine. Why connection depends on wifi factor?
