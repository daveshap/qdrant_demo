SHERIFF BURKE: She's okay. Looks like some boys were teasing her. Himbry's shutting down the school though. I want you to take look around.
DEWEY: Yes, sir, sheriff.
GALE: Hi! Gale Weathers. Field Correspondent, INSIDE STORY.
DEWEY: I know who you are, ma'am. How's the eye?
GALE: Productive. So they're closing down the school?
DEWEY: Well... uh... yes ma'am. For the time being.
GALE: And why is that? Has something happened?
DEWEY: You're not supposed to be here, ma'am.
GALE: I know, I should be in New York covering the Sharon Stone stalker but who knew? Please, call me Gale. You look awfully young to be a police officer.
DEWEY: I'm twenty-five years old, ma'am.
GALE: Twenty-five, huh? In a demographic study I proved to be most popular amongst males, 11-24. I just missed you. Of course, you don't look a day over twelve, except in the upper torso area. Does the force require that you work out?
