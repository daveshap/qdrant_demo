Unpopular Opinion: A2C is a toxic sub
For context, I'm a freshman in college who spent a lot of time lurking in this  sub last year. There's so much anxiety and fear over the college application process and honestly so much of it **doesn't fucking matter**. If you don't get into that prestigious-ass 1-10% acceptance rate university? You'll be fine. Seriously. Would it be great to go to a crazy good school? Sure. Definitely.  If you don't get into your "Dream School"It's not the end of the world.

I feel like this sub pushes the elitist mindset that, "you must get a 33+ ACT & have 20 different ECs & have a 5.6 GPA (how do you guys even do this? I don't think that was even possible at my school but okay?)" and I'm not here for it. This sub seems inaccessible to people with lower scores or different situations because it's very intimidating posting your stats if they are less than everyone else posting.

It also seems like this sub fosters a sort of anxious and dramatic tension. You can get lost in the worried haphazard posts talking about essays and applications, and it's draining.

I even cringe at the term "Dream School". Honestly, y'all have no freaking idea of what your dream school is like (I sure a s hell didn't going into orientation) and I've met so many people who regret their choice.  One thing I've realized in college is **how important fit is.** you should not go to a college just just because it's "the best school you can get into" because at the end of the day you need to put up with the environment you will be living in.

Learn as much as you can about the school you want to go to, and don't stress too much if you don't get into your first choice. The end of senior year will come earlier than you expect, so fucking enjoy your last year in HS.

Finally, getting into your "Dream School" over a less attractive school won't alleviate your problems. I had this mindset and boy was I in for a nasty surprise as I had to face academic hardship and a new college social scene at the same time.
