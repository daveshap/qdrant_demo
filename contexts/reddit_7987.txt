Scholarship taken away mid-semester (Did nothing wrong) - Can they do this and what are my options?
 

**Hello y'all, I hope things are going better for you right now. I am little depressed for some help and advice. I am currently a grad student, and during the mid-semester, I just found out through my payment portal that I'm getting charged about $20 Grand out of nowhere and they removed my scholarship and loans. I am currently against the wall right now. I can't pay for that and it is happening during the middle of the semester! I don't know why! I am planning to go to my financial aid, but I want to know my options before I walk in before they blindside me with some explanation. Is any chance for me to get my scholarship back? Plus, can a university do this legally? Take away a scholarship mid-semester? They probably can but I just want to be sure. Thank you!**


Edit: I just want to thank everyone for the support but unfortunately I just spoke to financial aid and it’s the worst news ever. It wasn’t a mistake and in fact, the mistake was me having the scholarship. The scholarship was for undergrad only and since I’m a grad student, they remove it mid-semester without telling me. It seems like I’m completely struck now. With no way to get out. I’m completely out of options and don’t know what to do. Thank you for your help though. I appreciate it.
