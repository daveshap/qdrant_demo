Anyone study their ass off in university just to end up in a job you don’t like?
As a teenager I was always good in math/science. I didn’t have any specific interests. So when the time came I had to choose what to with my life, I chose what I’m good at. So I got into engineering, out of all the different fields of engineering I thought civil engineering was the best fit for me. Grinded my ass off, though interesting, without a doubt worst 5 years of my life (while college/uni is supposed to be the best…) Anyway, I’m gonna have a good job with decent pay so it’s all worth it right? Wrong. Working as a project manager, salary aint great but also not bad. But now I see I have no passion for what I am doing, it's just a job and I am glad I can go home. Now I realize I might not have made the best choices in my life. And it’s not just my job, I come into contact with all kinds of people/jobs in construction. Anyone else in this situation?

Moral of the story: I know its cliché, but try to find something you are passionate about, only that will fulfill you. I hope I will be able to find this for myself.
