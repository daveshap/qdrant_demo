When you’re messaging someone and you don’t have time to reply for a few minutes so they message you “?” or “hello?” is so annoying and is such a huge turn off.
Like I get they might be eager to talk, but it comes off as desperate and clingy. Generally this happens when we just started talking too. 

Does anyone else feel similarly?
