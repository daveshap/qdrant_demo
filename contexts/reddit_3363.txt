New favourite rejection line is "I'm not used to dating someone as emotionally available as you"
After over 6 weeks of dating someone who didn't appear to have any red flags, who shared common values with me, who wanted the same things in the future, who bonded with me intellectually and emotionally, who saw me a few times a week and slept in my bed... I asked the question;

"Are you happy with how things are going?"

Down it spiralled, starting with "I'm still figuring things out" and ending up with the vague "I'm not feeling 100% about you and don't want to hold you back". He finished off with the line above, bear in mind this man is 36. 

Kudos to me for asking before I invested more.

But wow it still feels like another kick in the teeth.
