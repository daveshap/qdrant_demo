Possibility of business calls/leads being professionally stolen? Is it possible our VoIP calls being redirected from our intended phone number to another phone number unknown to us?  Our VoIP number is currently forwarded to mobile phones and computer phones.  Would this be an issue with our VoIP provider?  Our local network or our mobile phones?
