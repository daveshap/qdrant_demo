How does schooling effect getting a job
I’m nearing the end of year 10 and plan to leave and work full time for a year then move to apprenticeship this may seem a bit strange but I’ve got reasons I won’t get into here but am just wondering if school has any effect on this as in are my grades or attendance record connected in any way to applying for a job. I doubt my grades will be very high so would rather exclude that from the process and a lot of people are saying things like “your gonna have to have good grades so you can get a job” or the such but the job I already have didn’t have any connection to school. Aswell the same question but apprenticeship instead of a job if anyone has any idea. Sorry if my wording is wrong it’s very late at night I couldn’t sleep due to stressing about school and my future also sorry if this is the wrong sub or any other mistakes thanks in advance for any help. Also sorry if the flairs wrong.
