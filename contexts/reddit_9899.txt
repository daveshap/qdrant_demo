anyone know a good website to make multiple choice tests for studying?
basically looking for a good site (like quizlet) that allows you to make good multiple choice tests on the fly. I'm not talking about quizlet's multiple choice flash card feature (cause frankly it sucks)  I'm talking about actually having full control over the choices and such. I want to write one up to test myself for studying purposes
