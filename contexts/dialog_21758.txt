JAKE: Who's that?
JOEY: Whadda you care?
JAKE: Whadda ya mean, whadda I care? Who is she? What's a matter? You afraid I'm gonna take her on you?
JOEY: No, I'm not afraid. Why? You wanna meet her?
JAKE: Yeah --
JOEY: Cause I'll go right over there and bring her here.
JAKE: Go 'head.
JOEY: You sure you wanna meet her? Don't make me go over there, you change your mind and you make me look bad, cause she's really a knockout. She's 15, this kid -- a great piece of ass.
JAKE: How do you know? You know her that good?
JOEY: No, I see her around the pool. I know her. I know her like that -- not like that.
JAKE: Nah, not now... I wanna wait. I don't feel right...
JOEY: I'm tellin' you, she'll be there, I know she'll be there.
JAKE: 'Cause I wanna catch her alone.
JOEY: How you gonna catch anybody alone at a dance?... I don't know if she'll be there alone... She'll probably be there with her girlfriends or something.
JAKE: She ever go with them? Like Salvy?
JOEY: Nah, she don't go with nobody. She's only 15 years old.
JAKE: What does that have to do with it? She don't look 15 to me. I heard somethin' with Salvy. She was with him once or somethin', I think. It was like some blonde. That's the one...
JOEY: Probably. You know she talks to everybody, and not just him.
JAKE: Yeah, she's nice.
JOEY: Ah, some piece of ass, I'm tellin' you.
JAKE: You wasn't with her, were you?
JOEY: Huh?
JAKE: You wasn't with her?
JOEY: With her? How?
JAKE: You know, like bang her or anything?
JOEY: Ah, no, no. I didn't bang her. I know her from around here, that's all. You want to meet her or what?
JAKE: Nah, not now -- all those hard-ons around. I'll wait. Not now.
JOEY: I'm tellin' you, she'll be there, I know she'll be there. Dressed up and everything.
JAKE: I don't like all those other clowns around. That's all I know.
JOEY: C'mon, hurry up. We're never gonna get outa here tonight.
IRMA: Where you going at this hour?

IRMA: You fuckin' worm, if you're going out, I'm going out.
JAKE: And where you goin'?
IRMA: None of your fuckin' business.
