VICTORIA: Where is my son?
PRINCESS ALEXANDRA: Prince Albert is at Windsor, ma'am.
VICTORIA: Why is he not here?
PRINCESS ALEXANDRA: He is sick, ma'am.
VICTORIA: Then why are you not with him?
PRINCESS ALEXANDRA: You ordered all members of the Royal Family to attend you at Balmoral.
VICTORIA: What is the matter with him?
PRINCESS ALEXANDRA: He has typhoid fever, ma'am.
VICTORIA: No. You are mistaken. Prince Albert, my husband, had typhoid fever. I asked what was wrong with my son.
JENNER: The same, your Majesty.
VICTORIA: Why was I not informed?
JENNER: I did not consider it wise, in the circumstances, to tax your nerves.
VICTORIA: How ill is he?
