Salary raise for an internal promotion?
I’ve been offered an internal promotion with quite significant increase in responsibility, mainly line management responsibilities of four of my colleagues who I’m currently the same level as. I’ve been told to expect only a modest increase in pay due to getting quite a good bump in salary in the middle of last year. Is there an average increase people look for with these types of things?
