DETECTIVE WILLIAMS: By the way, Jeffrey, this story isn't going to the press and I'm going to ask you to consider all you've heard strictly confidential. Do not discuss this business with anyone, but me, or other police personnel. Got it?
JEFFREY: Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much as you did.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS: Come on. I'll drive you home. It's on my way.
