MILES: -- So much for the icebreakers. What're you after, Ruth?
RUTH: My client is prepared to settle for fifty percent of the marital assets.
MILES: Why only fifty percent, Ruth? Why not ask for a hundred percent?
RUTH: Oh brother. Here we go.
MILES: Why not a hundred and fifty percent?
RUTH: Yes. Maybe you're right, Miles. Maybe we're being too conservative. Seventy five percent.
MARYLIN: Do you need a Tagamet?
REX: You have some?
MARYLIN: These are yours.
MILES: Not according to Mrs. Rabinow.
MARYLIN: Have you been taking your digestive enzymes?
REX: Sometimes I forget.
MARYLIN: I'm sorry. Where were we?
RUTH: We were about to request the primary residence, and thirty percent of the remaining assets.
MILES: Are you familiar with Kirshner?
RUTH: Kirshner does not apply. Kirshner was in Kentucky.
REX: What's Kirshner?
MILES: Please -- let me handle this. Okay, Ruth, forget Kirshner -- what's your bottom line?
