Got a job offer, went through background and drug testing. Just found out they said i had marijuana in my system. They want me to come in and explain. I’m in northern California so it’s legal but still. What should I say?
I don’t really smoke these days. But I smoked one time few weeks ago, and apparently was still in my system although I used detox, which apparently didn’t work. I will have to go in and explain basically. I was thinking about saying that I was stressed so I ended up taking couple of hits, this was before I was offered the job. My friend suggested that i was with friends when they smoked and got second hand smoke being in same room. 

Anyone have experience this or anyone work in HR that can shed some light on what the better option is? I quit a while back and just ended up taking couple of hits. Now I’m stressed out I might not get the job.
