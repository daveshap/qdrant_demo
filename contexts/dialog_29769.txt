CLARENCE: Where's your car? I'll walk you to it.
ALABAMA: I took a cab.
CLARENCE: You took a cab to see three kung fu movies?
ALABAMA: Sure. Why not?
CLARENCE: Nothing. It's just you're a girl after my own heart.
ALABAMA: What time is it?
CLARENCE: 'Bout twelve.
ALABAMA: I suppose you gotta get up early, huh?
CLARENCE: No. Not particularly. How come?
ALABAMA: Well, it's just when I see a really good movie I really like to go out and get some pie, and talk about it. It's sort of tradition. Do you like to eat pie after you've seen a good movie?
CLARENCE: I love to get pie after a movie.
ALABAMA: Would you like to get some pie?
CLARENCE: I'd love some pie.
CLARENCE: Well, enough about the King. How about you?
ALABAMA: How 'bout me what?
CLARENCE: Tell me about yourself.
ALABAMA: There's nothing to tell.
CLARENCE: C'mon. What're ya tryin' to be? The Phantom Lady?
ALABAMA: What do you want to know?
CLARENCE: Well, for starters, what do you do? Where're ya from? What's your favorite color? Who's your favorite movie star? What kinda music do you like? What are your turn-ons and turn-offs? Do you have a fella? What's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone? And, in a theater full of empty seats, why did you sit by me?
ALABAMA: Ask me them again. One by one.
CLARENCE: What do you do?
ALABAMA: I don't remember.
CLARENCE: Where are you from.
ALABAMA: Might be from Tallahassee. But I'm not sure yet.
CLARENCE: What's your favorite color?
ALABAMA: I don't remember. But off the top of my head, I'd say black.
CLARENCE: What's your favorite movie star?
ALABAMA: Burt Reynolds.
CLARENCE: Would you like a bite of my pie?
ALABAMA: Yes, I would.
CLARENCE: Like it?
ALABAMA: Very much. Now, where were we?
CLARENCE: What kinda music do you like?
ALABAMA: Phil Spector. Girl group stuff. You know, like He's a Rebel"."
CLARENCE: What are your turn-ons?
ALABAMA: Mickey Rourke, somebody who can appreciate the finer things in life, like Elvis's voice, good kung fu, and a tasty piece of pie.
CLARENCE: Turn-offs?
ALABAMA: I'm sure there must be something, but I don't really remember. The only thing that comes to mind are Persians.
CLARENCE: Do you have a fella?
ALABAMA: I'm not sure yet. Ask me again later.
CLARENCE: What's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone?
ALABAMA: Apparently, I was hit on the head with something really heavy, giving me a form of amnesia. When I came to, I didn't know who I was, where I was, or where I came from. Luckily, I had my driver's license or I wouldn't even know my name. I hoped it would tell me where I lived but it had a Tallahassee address on it, and I stopped somebody on the street and they told me I was in Detroit. So that was no help. But I did have some money on me, so I hopped in a cab until I saw somethin' that looked familiar. For some reason, and don't ask me why, that theater looked familiar. So I told him to stop and I got out.
CLARENCE: And in a theater full of empty seats, why did you sit by me?
ALABAMA: Because you looked like a nice guy, and I was a little scared. And I sure couldda used a nice guy about that time, so I spilled my popcorn on you.
