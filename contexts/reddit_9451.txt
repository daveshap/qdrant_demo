I feel like I can breathe!!!
This is going to be ranty but I am so excited and I have no one to tell! I’m 19. I moved out when I was 15 and started working, and tried to learn my finances as I went. Last year, I got a couple credit cards and after ending up in a bad place mentally I started buying things to make myself feel better. In June I was facing moving back in with my abusive family because I was 6k in debt (just cards, not my vehicle) and didn’t have enough money to pay my basic bills, let alone food, etc. 

Also in June, a new job found me. They pay above minimum wage, we are tipped (in a monthly check) AND I was able to land housing through them! 

With no rent/utilities, I FINALLY was able to feed myself and start looking at getting my shit together.  I’ve been working at it since and making progress.

Tonight I got my check that includes my  monthly tips ($1840.00 total). I put $240 in my checking for food and gas, leaving $1600 (!!) for the rest. I paid the remainder of cards for $175, $67, $66, $730 AND put $550 towards a card that has been past maxed out for 6 months at $2300+. 

I now owe less than $1800 not including my car and I’m looking at being out of debt as soon as MEXT MONTH. 

The kicker, and the part I’m incredibly grateful for, is that I even have $1100 in my savings (although some will be going for shots for my dog this month.)

I feel like I can breathe again and it’s incredible


Edit: thank you all for the love and tips! You all made my day, and I appreciate this sub for inspiring me to try to get myself together.
