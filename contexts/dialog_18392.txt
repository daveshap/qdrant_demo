PAINE: His first 'whiff'!
SUSAN: Such pretty knees for a big boy!
PAINE: Do I actually *see* this--?
SUSAN: Listen, Father! Young Lochinvar smitten with Susan Paine"!"
SAUNDERS: You want to see me, Senator?
PAINE: Yes. Good morning, Saunders. Have you--uh--any idea how this happened?
SAUNDERS: The ranger's notices? No idea at all.
PAINE: No?
SAUNDERS: No--I'm sorry. I merely saw him home. I'm not supposed to tuck him in and give him his bottle. That's McGann's job.
PAINE: By the way, Mr. McGann just phoned-- in a high fever. Smith's gone again. Have you any idea where?
SAUNDERS: Yes. He went to Mount Vernon to give himself a patriotic address.
PAINE: Well--that's very fine. Saunders, some person in your office says you've quit--
SAUNDERS: That's right.
PAINE: Oh, now--that won't do--
SAUNDERS: Look, Senator--I wasn't given a brain just to tell a Boy Ranger what time it is. What do you need me for? Get somebody else--get a registered nurse--
PAINE: You're the best nurse I can think of--
SAUNDERS: Nice *compliment*!
PAINE: I meant it for one. I meant--Sam Foley couldn't get along without you-- and neither can I at the moment--
SAUNDERS: No?
PAINE: You see--Governor Hopper made an appointment in this case that--well, Jeff isn't exactly fitted to the work, let's say. He's here to see monuments--and pass the time. That's important to--to my work--and everybody concerned. So, someone who can be trusted has to occupy him and keep him out of trouble--
SAUNDERS: And I'm an old hand at following instructions--
PAINE: You're more than that. I've had example of the fact that wild horses couldn't pull confidential matter in these two offices out of you. That's why I tell you what I do--about Smith and this situation. So, you see--
SAUNDERS: Yeah--I see I'm right where I've been for seven years--
PAINE: You deserve a lot better. And I'll tell you what we'll do. Stay and play nurse, as you say--and if certain things happen I'm taking everybody up with me, and you'll get one of the biggest jobs in Washington.
SAUNDERS: Yeah? And what else?
PAINE: What do you mean?
SAUNDERS: Well, when I first came to Washington, my eyes were big, blue question marks-- now they're big, green dollar marks--
PAINE: I see. All right. You finish this job properly--and you get a handsome bonus besides--
