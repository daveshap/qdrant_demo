JOE: I'm sorry I got you into this.
RENE: It was my choice.
AL: You're a lucky man.
JOE: Yeah, sure.
RENE: Don't blame yourself, I didn't have to come along.
JOE: Why did you, then?
RENE: For you.
AL: She's so lovely. It's all my fault...I was wrong.
JOE: You're lovely.
RENE: I'm...scared.
AL: Look, I don't know how we're gonna get out of this.
JOE: I don't know how we're gonna get out of this, but we will, somehow.
AL: I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done.
JOE: I want to thank you for what you've done.
RENE: I didn't do anything.
AL: I know we fight, but I don't mean it. You're quite a guy. No one else could have dealt with this.
JOE: Awwww...
AL: I mean it! No one else would have helped. I take it all back, everything I've said about you.
RENE: I encouraged you to come here. My fault as much as yours.
JOE: I was...crazy...desperate. I took it out on you. I didn't mean it. I know what she sees in you. You're kind and you're brave. If I ever get out of you, I'll be glad to call you my friend.
