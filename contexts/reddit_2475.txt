How do I politely ask for the salary so I’m not wasting my time doing multiple interviews?
I’m interviewing with a company overseas and I’ve done 3 interviews already and I thought I would know how much the pay would be on the third interview since they asked about my current pay but they said they’d like to conduct another interview before offering. I would hate to do 4-5 interviews just to find out the pay is not what I expected or for them to find out I’m asking too much, so I how do I politely ask for the salary so we don’t waste each other’s time? Thanks
