installing tp link tl-wn822n on ubuntu 18.04 okay so im having some issues. im very new to linux at this point ive only used it for about a day. and i bought a tp link wifi adapter for better internet. while ubuntu seems to notice it and connect through it, im having a lot of trouble downloading and installing drivers. the guide they give seems to have incomplete commands for me to follow along with in terminal and the only drivers im getting are a folder with some text files and code. i was kind of following it until it told me to compile the drivers by going into the driver directory. i don't know were whats installing to. please i dont want to bother people but im totally lost and i don't want to feel like i just wasted 30 dollars on a hunk of broken plastic. and so far ive only seen threads about it on ubuntu 14 and 16. also im very sorry for not giving you the wireless info script. terminal keeps telling me its unable to resolve host adress, this is also not a connection problem its a speed problem. installing the drivers as ive been told dont work. i get a bunch of error messages. when installing things like sudo apt-get install rtl8192cu-dkms terminal tells me it is unable to locate the package. there's supposed to be a chip.ko file in the directory but i dont see any chip.ko file or any new file names from what comes in the base download. edit: the kernal version for ubuntu 18 is too new to work with this device. please stop flagging this as a duplicate when the threads talking about this device do not address any of these issues.
