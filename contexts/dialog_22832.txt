DANNY: CAN I PULL MY FUCKING DICK OUT?!
POOH-BEAR: Yeah.
DANNY: I ought to just call this whole thing off right now.
POOH-BEAR: Don't do that. Please. Or I'll kill you. Please, Danny.
DANNY: What the hell was that? Who told you I was five-0?
POOH-BEAR: No one. It was just a test. I need to be sure of who I'm dealing with from time-to-time.
DANNY: Did it ever occur to you that someone might cop to something they didn't do rather than have their balls chewed off by a rabid weasel?
POOH-BEAR: I'll keep that in mind.
TANNER: We're in business.
GARCETTI: Good work, Flynne. You're a first-rate rat.
DANNY: That's real sweet, Garcetti. Thanks.
TANNER: We got the 411 on your good old boy.
DANNY: Murder. Beautiful.
TANNER: Pumped fifty-seven bullets into a police informant.
DANNY: You know, I'm starting to think I'd rather take my chances with Domingo than go through any more of this shit.
GARCETTI: Didn't you hear? Domingo's dead.
TANNER: Took a pig-slicker to the heart.
DANNY: Jesus.
TANNER: I thought you'd be happy.
DANNY: Yeah.
