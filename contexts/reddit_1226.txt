Does anyone else find that once you get rid of one source of anxiety, another will immediately replace it?
I've been doing a lot better lately with not panicking over work and social events and making life plans. But I am getting weird anxiety over how I look and feeling super self conscious about my appearance all the time.

I've no idea why, it's not been much of an issue before. I definitely don't need a new thing to worry about! It's so exhausting that stresses like this never seem to truly stop, even when I think I'm getting better. 

Edit: I finally managed to read all these comments now I'm home from work. Thank you everyone for making me feel like I'm not on my own in this! Some of you have made me think I might need to try the doctor/therapist route again because I think I can only get so far on my own. Overall though, today was a good day! I hope you have all had a good day too :)
