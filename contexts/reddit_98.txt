My girlfriend came out and I need a bit of help
My girlfriend of four years (been together since we were 14) came out to me as gender fluid. I know this sounds stupid but we have been talking about having kids recently and what that would be like. And now I'm scared that's not going to happen.. She said she only sometimes feels like a guy but she doesnt know if that's her just being masculinely gay cause shes also poly so the gay jokes are strong with her all the time. I already told her that I would love her no matter what and no matter who she was but I dont want to be with a guy or even someone that's sometimes a guy. I've been laying in bed just staring as the ceiling thinking about every bit of the future we talked about dissapearing while shes asleep on the phone. I want to tell her that I dont want to be with a guy because of my parents being religious, my friends calling me gay and shit, and just being looked at differently when I'm around her but I dont want to make her feel like a mistake. Otherwise I really wouldn't mind if it meant I got to still have her in some way. Even if its not who I've known for a good portion if my life. If I'm missing something about gender fluidity please explain more and if i could get some help on how to break what i just said to her or even how to cope with possibly losing what we have that would be great

Thanks. 

Also this is a throw away so friends that know my actual account dont see this.
