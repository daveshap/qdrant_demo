MCCULLOCH: All right. But if it mysteriously disappears en route, I'll have you sent back home the minute we dock. Understood?
TAMARA: Perfectly.
TAMARA: A major prick.
EVA: What are you going to do?
TAMARA: Improvise, of course.
MISS VAN DEUSEN: Hello, Charles. Has everyone checked in?
MCCULLOCH: Jim Miller and Suzy Donaldson never showed up. I'm a little concerned.
MISS VAN DEUSEN: Don't be. They probably decided to explore each other rather than New York.
MCCULLOCH: Let's go -- we're running two minutes late.
MISS VAN DEUSEN: Charles, there's someone else coming along too.
MCCULLOCH: You have no right...
MISS VAN DEUSEN: And neither do you. It's up to Rennie to decide what she wants to do.
MCCULLOCH: She doesn't know what she wants. She's never had a stable life.
MISS VAN DEUSEN: And she sure doesn't have one now, either. She needs to live.
MCCULLOCH: I'm her legal guardian, not you or anybody else, and I alone know what's best for her. End of discussion.
MISS VAN DEUSEN: No, I think it's just the beginning.
