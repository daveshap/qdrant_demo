"Killing yourself is SELFISH"
You might've heard this when mentioning suicide to somebody, or talking about it. Maybe you even said it to someone else if you're not suicidal. I'll make this clear, IT'S FUCKING RUDE! Seriously, what is insulting a suicidal person gonna do? I'll tell you what it won't do, it won't pull them away from the edge. I had a friend who was at the bottom point, where they could hardly do anything, and they spent 2 months in a hospital due to brain damage from asphyxiation, and even longer in a different hospital while they took medicine and rehabilitation courses. I asked them years later what pushed them too far during a conversation about it, and they said "I kept hearing how selfish I was being, and I hated it and it just made me want to do it more and more. I only pulled back when they stopped saying that, (a doctor) told my family to stop saying it because it was untrue, and I felt a relief knowing he knew better than they did, and he knew it wasn't selfishness to me..." He went on for a while. I wish I took more of it to heart though, maybe I wouldn't feel so bad.
