You can't have your cake and eat it too...
You (27F) can hate me (27M) all you want but I am not obligated to stick around in your life if I know it'll hurt me. You wanted to date other guys, so why are you so shocked when I say that I'm finished with you? If those other guys want to play around, they can do it all they want. But I know I deserve better than to be just one of who the hell knows how many side dates. You hate me for the simple fact that you can't have me. You can't just have every guy, deal with it!
