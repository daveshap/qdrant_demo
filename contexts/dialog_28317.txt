MARY: Yeah, don't talk in someone's backswing.
HEALY: Thanks.
HEALY: I'm gonna get a soda, you want one?
MARY: No thanks.
HEALY: Oh cripes. Do you have change for a dollar? All I have is these stupid Nepalese coins.
MARY: Nepal? Have you been?
HEALY: Not in months. I don't even know why I bought the damn place.
MARY: You own a home there?
HEALY: Well... it's just a condo really. Right outside Katmandu.
MARY: Wow. That's a place I've always wanted to go. Is it true the mountains are so tall you can't see the tops?
HEALY: Not 'til you get about three hundred yards from the summit. That's been my experience anyway.
