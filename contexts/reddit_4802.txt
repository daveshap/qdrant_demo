Hey, i just joined reddit and wanted to share something i just wrote. Maybe someone likes it.
It’s a party. I haven’t talked to anyone yet. My boyfriend asks me if I don’t want to say hi to some people we know. I tell him to wait until I have my third glass down. Three is my lucky number when drinking (that’s how many glasses it takes to make me go from totally social awkward to social butterfly). After that, I even go to the toilet with a girl I know.

As I am waiting for her, a glass in each hand, a girl I saw some times in school walks up to me. “Hey girl, I haven’t seen you for so long! How are you? Haven’t you been to school lately? Must have been some months since I last saw you. Is it true you’re dating Dave?” I don’t know her name, but thanks to the drink in my hand, it doesn’t matter. “Yes, we have been dating for some months now. You look mesmerizing tonight!”

I go out to meet my boyfriend again. Some time later the same girl, which now has a name, Anna, sits next to us and starts a conversation. I slowly open up, of course because of the alcohol, but she really seems to want to be friends. So, we hang out all night. We exchange numbers, talk for hours, dance and even ‘drunk-girl-friend’ kissed sometimes.

I get tired, we walk home. I couldn’t say bye to her. In the morning, I write her “I hope you arrived home safe”

She says “Yes”

I say “I’m really happy for that”

She never answers.

My boyfriend always asks why I can’t talk to people and why I don’t even try anymore. I used to not really understand that myself, but now I do. The more you open up to people, the more it hurts when they don’t open up to you. The more you care about others, the more it hurts when they don’t care about you. I know it shouldn’t make me so sad that I girl I hung around with once doesn’t care about me, but I can’t not care about people I like. And it seems I like pretty much anyone.
