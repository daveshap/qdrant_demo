MAX: He's got her up in the room, under guard. And he's still working the party... acting smooth like nothin's nothin'. So buddy... I say we work a trade.
LENNY: What do you mean?
MAX: Give him the tape. See? It's fucking brilliant! The tape for Faith. I know he'll go for it. I can set it up.
LENNY: This is what we laughingly refer to as a plan, right?
MAX: Come on! If he gives us any shit, we kill 'em all. Whattya say? Just get your butt down here. If I'm not at the shindig downstairs go to the room. It's 2203. You writin'?
LENNY: 2-2-0-3. Got it. Stay on her.
MAX: I intend to.
LENNY: Okay, we gotta get over there. Can you borrow a dress from Cecile or something--
MACE: I'm not going.
LENNY: Whatya mean? We're going! Tran's gonna do her right there unless--
MACE: Lenny... shutup. Just park your mouth and listen. It's a set-up. Think about it! Why's he been sending you tapes? To freak you, get you to rush in without thinking. Then they put one in you, put one in her, put the gun in your hand... crime of passion. This guy's bent enough to think of that.
