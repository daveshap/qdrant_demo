CHIEF NURSE: What you did yesterday was reckless at best. You are not an employee of this hospital! If that boy dies I don't even want to think of the lawsuit that'll follow. Are we communicating here?
BETTY: Yes, ma'am.
CHIEF NURSE: Good. I'm prepared to offer you a job. You can help out in the pharmacy until your California certification and references arrive, but you are not to touch anyone. Is that totally clear? Fine...
CHIEF NURSE: You can start tomorrow. And don't say a word about this to anyone. Is that issue?
BETTY: Umm... yes. Back home.
CHIEF NURSE: Alright. Oh, and one more thing about what you did yesterday... Well done.
