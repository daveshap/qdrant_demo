STANDARD: Well, we can't go anywhere in this darkness. How long till dawn?
MELKONIS: Well... this rock rotates every two hours. The sun should be coming up in about 20 minutes.
BROUSSARD: Good! Maybe we'll be able to see something then.
ROBY: Or something will be able to see us.
ROBY: There could be a whole city out there and we'd never see it.
BROUSSARD: Not sitting on our butts in here, that's for sure.
STANDARD: Just settle down. Sandy, you get any response yet?
MELKONIS: Sorry. Nothing but that same damn transmission, every 32 seconds. I've tried every frequency on the spectrum.
