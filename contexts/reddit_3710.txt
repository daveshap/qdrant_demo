A PSA to every guy who is starting to get frustrated
A friend of mine who is 30 and has never been in a serious LTR sent me a screenshot the other day of his exchange with a girl he knew from work and was setting up a first date with. He wanted to know if he was "getting played."

For whatever reason she wasn't very communicative and the date day had passed. 

His responses were short and annoyed. Asking "When we seeing eachother?" her responses were simply side stepping his questions and his responses got more and more frustrated. 

My advice to him and to every guy experiencing something like this is:

1) You need to completely reframe why you're talking to women in the first place

2) If a girl is acting flakey, ESPECIALLY before a first date, just move on and whatever you do, **never** show frustration.


Re number 1, I've been in a couple LTR's (6 and 3 years) and I think generally speaking my goal is to make a connection with a girl who is interesting. Obviously I need to be attracted to her too and obviously sex is on my mind if that's the case, but my main goal is not to get laid as soon as possible and I think the lack of desparation is obvious to my dates. 

I've been trying to understand what I've been doing right these last few months as my dates have been pretty successfull. 

It's 100% what you value. I place a lot of value in building close relationships with people in general, especially with women.  

If a woman isn't interested in that, with me, I move on because why would I waste my time forcing something that can't be forced? 

So ask yourself, what do I actually value in dating, what am I truly looking for? And if that person doesn't seem to align, move on.
