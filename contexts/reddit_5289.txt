Why I dislike the corporate world
Been working 11-12 years in my line of work. It's the kind of work that goes in waves/projects. We have to do the actual work, but also  be organized, book meetings, interview co-workers in other departments, write reports, issue issues, follow-up on them etc.

I have been assigned to a single project under my manager, who I both like and respect. 

Lately it has been so slow due to the delay of our project I have literally nothing to do. Been surfing the net all day. I sit next to my manager BTW.

Yesterday he had to stay home to watch his twins  because of nanny issues, and assigned me nothing. Today I got in an hour early and NOBODY is here except the peons like myself.

Now I recognize I could reach out to my boss and say I have nothing to do, but I've learned in the corporate world this is a bad idea. Image is important. Drives me nuts I can't just go hang out at home while doing the same work.  


I should admit I have issues taking initiative on my own, but I'm amazing at completing tasks or following instructions, so I tend to freeze up at these times.
