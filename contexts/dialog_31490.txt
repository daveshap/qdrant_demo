GIRL: There's little chicks! You want to see?
WALTER: Sure.
GIRL: They're starlings.
WALTER: Is that right?
GIRL: I don't like starlings.
WALTER: Why not?
GIRL: They're extremely aggressive birds. Plus, their habits are rather filthy.
WALTER: The mother sure has her hands full.
WALTER: You always carry these?
GIRL: When I go bird-watching. It's why I like coming here.
WALTER: It's just a city park.
GIRL: You'd be surprised how many kinds of birds you'll see here. Last week I saw a purple martin. And the week before that, I saw a solitary vireo. That's rare.
WALTER: A solitary vireo. I like that one.
GIRL: Their sound is quite musical.
WALTER: How does it sound?
GIRL: It's hard to describe.
WALTER: Try.
GIRL: I can't.
WALTER: I bet you can.
WALTER: I'd love to hear it.
GIRL: It's a bright sound.
