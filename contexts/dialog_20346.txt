FOLEY: Some people are going out of here. What if I told you where and when?
PUP: How many?
FOLEY: I expect you to look out for me, Pup, let me run off work details.
PUP: Okay. How many going out?
FOLEY: I hear six.
PUP: When?
FOLEY: Looks like tonight.
PUP: You know who they are?
FOLEY: I do, but I won't tell you just yet. Meet me in the chapel at eight-thirty, right before lock-down.
