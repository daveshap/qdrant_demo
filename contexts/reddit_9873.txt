Does working in Student Services at a college increase your odds of being hired as a professor at that college in the future?
Long story short-- I am a graduate student whose ultimate goal is to be a college professor. I am working towards landing a part-time academic advising position at a community college. I think this would be a great opportunity for me to get my foot in the door of Higher Education (and it also seems like a position I would really enjoy).

Does anyone know if this type of experience would help me get an adjunct (and then hopefully full-time) position in the future? I have three years of high school teaching experience as well. I just know Higher Ed experience is probably more valuable in this case.

Thanks!

Edit: I forgot to specify that my goal is to be an English professor.
