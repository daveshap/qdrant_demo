Another week of not buying fast food!
So in the attempt to save money and help pay down my credit card more, once again I have had the willpower to not buy fast food for the entire week. 
On Sunday, I went to Aldi and bought $100 worth of groceries to hopefully last me for 2 weeks. 

Sunday night, I made a take and bake pizza from Aldi (I didn't really like it. The crust was kind of doughy and the sauce was too sweet for my liking but considering my roommate caught our oven on fire last week, the doughy crust might be a result of that.)

Monday, I just ate leftover pizza before one of my final exams. Even though I didn't like it, I didn't want to waste food.

Tuesday, I made a simple oven bake Campbell's skillet meal type thing. It was literally two chicken breasts, one potato cut in half and I poured the sauce over it. Baked in the oven at 400 degrees for 50 minutes and it was delicious. It was perfect considering I had 2 final exams on Tuesday. 

Wednesday, I had my last final exam. I utilized my crock pot and made a pot roast with carrots and potatoes. Cooked on high for 6 hours. 

Thursday, had leftover pot roast. Was even better the day after.

And Friday, I made cheesy chicken and rice. Utilized the crock pot again. I have enough leftovers to last me the entire weekend. 


I'm really proud of myself again for not buying fast food. Especially with it being finals week and the end of my school's semester. My roommate isn't paying her share of the utilities (sigh. Cannot wait for March) and while that's stressing me out big time, I didn't give into temptation of buying out as "treat". I'm able to pay the utility bills in full this month since my roommate is being a a-hole and refusing to pay her share. 

I can give more detailed recipes for what I made this week if anyone wants them! And if anyone has some easy recipes to share, please send them to me!
