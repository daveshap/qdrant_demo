TUNA: Figured it out.
GEORGE: Figured what out?
TUNA: You know how we were wondering what we were going to do for money? Being how we don't want to get jobs and whatnot? Well, check this out.
BARBARA: Tuna, this is crap.
TUNA: I know it's not the greatest. It's commercial.
BARBARA: It's garbage.
GEORGE: It's oregano. You got ripped off, pal. What are you gonna do with all this?
TUNA: We sell it. I got it all figured out. We make three finger lids and sell them on the beach. We move all of it. We've made ourselves a hundred bucks. Or a lot of weed for our head. What do you think? Not bad, huh? I got the baggies and everything.
BARBARA: You can't sell this to your friends.
TUNA: Man. Fuck you guys. I have this great idea and you guys have to be all skeptical.
BARBARA: Look, if you really wanna score some dope, I got the guy.
GEORGE: Are you sure this guy is cool?
BARBARA: You'll see for yourself.
