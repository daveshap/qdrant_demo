Would you stay at a company that hasn't offered a cost of living adjustment in 2 years?
 

I  like the company I work for. However, I have been here 3 years and my  last actual "raise" of any kind was over 2 years ago. Last year bonuses  added a couple of thousand to my yearly income. This year I expect to  make 3-4k less than last year.

From  my knowledge of the company, we are making similar money as we did last  year. My 3 year mark was 2 months ago with not a hint of a raise or cost of living adjustment. My pay is the same as it was 2 year ago so  far this year. No bonuses given so far this year.

Base  pay is 44k for a Marketing, IT & Website management role in the  company(multiple hats). Located in the south(USA). 2 weeks vacation, no  sick leave and a small healthcare credit($125) each month that won't cover any descent plan on the marketplace. No dental, life or vision. No 401k either. I was told offering healthcare was too expensive for a small business so a credit is offered instead.

The credit has not been increased in what I can only guess is more than 7 years. Each year the healthcare on the marketplace goes up by 14-25%, or so it seems. In the 3 years I have been here my tiny credit is worth even less towards a plan. Most family plans are now 850-1400 a month that cover anything. $125 is a drop in the bucket.

We have around 20 employees most of the time. I make most things work  around here along with managing several websites(and building them). I  also have the official title of Marketing Manager and do marketing tasks but its not the main role even though I have the title. I report directly to  the owner and a direct supervisor above me. I am also the companies Photographer/Video guy with our own studio. 

At this point in my life(30 years old) I really want more paid leave, some actual sick time and more pay to raise a family on. A larger healthcare credit or actual healthcare would be nice. 

Thoughts?
