Are there days in the office when you’ve done minimal/no work? Have you ever put off work for the entire day too?
I just started my first full-time job out of college a couple weeks ago and today was the worst I’ve had in terms of completing things and actually just doing work. I allowed myself to watch the majority of the Blasey Ford hearing for several hours and it doesn’t help that my boss is on vacation until tomorrow(she’s a great boss and I like her btw). Other days I’ve been on my phone for an hour or gone web browsing for a while. I feel like shit for being super lazy today and have no idea how commonplace or rare this is in the office. It’s not like I didn’t have things to do, it’s that they didn’t need to be done immediately. Can anyone relate to this, especially in a new job setting? 

EDIT:
Thanks for all the feedback and advice! I work at a super small company (only 6 people!) and I’m the only one with my title which was also just created after the last person left and they shifted the role a little bit. Not to mention that fact that the boss tends to be out of the office a lot of days and nobody really checks up on me so I’m given a lot of leeway. But it’s true, I’m probably not trusted with a lot of stuff yet; I even told them during the interview process that I would be branching out more outside my duties if I could help it. Overall, it’s fairly easy to slip into laziness at this work level so I think I’ll start asking my boss for more stuff starting next week and the week after.
