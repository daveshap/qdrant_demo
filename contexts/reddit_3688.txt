Ending a A Relationship Is Really Hard
I see a lot people who post on here about being broken up with, and I have been on the receiving end many many times so I know how it feels, but it's also really hard being the person that ends it.

I just ended a relationship with a girl I was only seeing for a month. It was due to incompatibility with how we dealt with problems. I like to deal with problems head on and discuss them to try and make sure there are no misunderstandings whereas she had an ignore it till it goes away approach.

Her feelings were much stronger than mine. After a lengthy text exchange we finally said our final goodbyes and it sucks knowing what I feel is self-inflicted and it really hurts me that she is hurting as well.

I ended it because there was a 6 month expiry date to the relationship anyway given that I'd be leaving the country soon and I felt like some of the problems we were having would keep recurring given our different approaches to problem solving.

Anyways, I feel like crap. It is extremely hard, and I mean **extremely** hard, when someone is crying their heart out to you. No one enjoys inflicting emotional pain on people they care about. It's so hard to stick the course and not change your mind and give in and give it just one more try.

Breaking up with someone you care about is really difficult. It's why I never say anything nasty to someone during a breakup, whether I'm breaking up with her or she's breaking up with me, and luckily most girls haven't said anything nasty to me either.
