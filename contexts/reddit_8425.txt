What are the strengths and weaknesses of the legal foundations of Roe v. Wade?
What are the strengths and weaknesses of the legal foundations of Roe v. Wade?  [Roe v. Wade](http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/roe.html) is the Supreme Court decision that ensures abortion rights.  ["In 1973, the U.S. Supreme Court recognized a woman's constitutional right to an abortion in Roe v. Wade. The landmark ruling legalized abortion nationwide but has been under attack ever since."](https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/smart-facts/what-roe-v-wade-everything-you-need-know-n856891)  What are the best legal theories for sustaining or overturning this decision?

[Current events suggest that the Supreme Court may need to revisit this old decision](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-abortion-explainer/roe-v-wade-at-risk-key-facts-on-legal-challenges-to-us-abortion-rights-idUSKCN1SL28J). *"There is a very good chance if this makes it to the Supreme Court that Roe v. Wade would be overturned because we’ve known since the ‘70s that Roe v. Wade stands on a weak foundational basis," Cevallos said. "Whether you’re pro-life or pro-choice, Roe v. Wade is really about, do we have an individual, fundamental — do women have a privacy right in the Constitution that overrides state legislatures’ abilities to make laws affecting abortion."* [LINK](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/msnbc-legal-analyst-good-chance-roe-v-wade-could-be-overturned)

Planned Parenthood suggests: ["The right to safe and legal abortion has been the law of the land for more than 45 years, and is a part of the fabric of this country. Roe v. Wade is clearly established precedent, and it shouldn’t be up for debate."](https://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/issues/abortion/roe-v-wade) Many [agree](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2019/01/09/justice-kavanaugh-raises-questions-about-overruling-precedent/?slreturn=20190418131938) with Planned Parenthood, that under the legal principle of [stare decisis](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/stare_decisis) Roe v. Wade should not be overturned unless it really does have a weak legal foundation. This is why I am asking what are the strengths and weaknesses of the legal foundations of Roe v. Wade?
