CINDY: It was you...
HANSON: Yes, it was me all along. I killed Hugh Kane and his mistress.
CINDY: Both of them?
HANSON: Didn't I just say that? Fucking listen. Anyway, I did it all for Carolyn. He never appreciated her, but I worshipped that woman and still she rejected me. So, I came back for you. Just like I did for Carolyn.
CINDY: This can't be happening?
HANSON: Now you'll be mine, Cindy.
CINDY: Noooo!!!
HANSON: Yes!!!!
