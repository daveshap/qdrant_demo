What is an OEM SSD for Macbook Pro I have a Macbook Pro 13\" Retina Display (Early 2015). I only have 128 GB of storage. I'm thinking of upgrading it. I've seen a lot of articles about purchasing OWC or Trascend's drives; however, I have not seen any article about purchasing OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) drives. I found some on eBay -- they are just a lot more expensive!Is there something I'm missing? Do people not recommend them because of price, or because they are not really original? If I buy one of these drives, can I hook them up to my MacBook just like I would a Trascend or OWC Aura drives?
