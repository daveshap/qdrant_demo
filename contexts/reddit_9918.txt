Concerned about financial compensation in the Student Affairs Profession
Hello SA professionals! 

I am currently on my grad school search trying to find the right program for myself. I'm currently taking an Intro to Student Affairs course at my university and I'm very interested in the field.

What worries me is the pay. Now, I understand that it's more important to find work that I love than to find a job that pays well, but coming from an engineering undergrad I have had this expectation that I will make decent money right out of college. 

Another factor that plays into this is that my parents have never known financial stability (I'm first gen and of a lower socioeconomic background). I am also going to be ~23k in debt after undergrad. 

Do you all feel financially stable? How did you handle loans? How likely that I would be able to move up the salary ladder within ~5 years time? 

If you have any other advice or questions, please feel free to ask or add it! Thanks :)
