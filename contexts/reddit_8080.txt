Loan my way through Grad School to avoid work?
Greetings /r/GradSchool,

I'm going to be entering grad school this fall to attempt to get my Master's in Computer Science, and I had some questions about loans that I can't get a consistent answer on.

Essentially, I want to focus my time and energy on school and really make it count.  I'm going to have to take out loans to pay for tuition and most likely to supplement my cost of living (since I will no longer be able to work full time while going to school).  The question then becomes:  should I just get loans to cover my entire cost of living for the duration I'll be in school (~2 years)?  I (optimistically) plan on having a decent career coming out of school, so significant student loan debt seems worth it, but I'm not sure how others feel about it.

I've talked to friends who have been/are in grad school, and their experiences are varied.  Some have taken out significant loans even during undergrad (I currently have 0 student loans), and some paid out of pocket while working during grad school (albeit, in a program that might not be as intensive as the one I'm going into).

How much is too much?  Or should I plan on working half-time during the semester?

I'll also note that I'm dismissing any possible scholarships or internships for the sake of simplicity and covering my bases.  Essentially I'd like to know that I have everything covered going into school, and anything I can take off the top I will as I go.

Thanks for any advice!
