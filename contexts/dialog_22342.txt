BENVOLIO: Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.
ROMEO: In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
BENVOLIO: I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.
ROMEO: A right good marks-man! And she's fair I love.
BENVOLIO: A right fair mark, fair cuz, is soonest hit.
ROMEO: Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit With Cupid's arrow; Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes, Nor open her lap to saint-seducing gold:
BENVOLIO: Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
ROMEO: She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste.
BENVOLIO: Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.
ROMEO: Teach me how I should forget to think.
BENVOLIO: By giving liberty unto thine eyes; Examine other beauties. Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
ROMEO: Not mad, but bound more than a mad-man is; Shut up in prison, kept without my food, Whipp'd and tormented. Good day, good fellow.
