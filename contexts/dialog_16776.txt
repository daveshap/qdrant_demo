MARY: Rose is on the phone and here's the cards for today --
JIMMY: Fifteen minutes ago, where were those cards?
MARY: I'm sorry.
JIMMY: I need you to get me Paula --
MARY: You want her right now?
JIMMY: Yes. Now. Find her. She's somewhere in the building --
MARY: We're on the air in twenty minutes, Jimmy.
JIMMY: Find her, get her and tell her I want to talk to her, Mary. Fucking hell.
