ROB: Imagine my surprise when I got your call, Max.
ALVY: Yeah. I had the feeling that I got you at a bad moment. You know, I heard high-pitched squealing.
ROB: Twins, Max. Sixteen-year-olds. Can you imagine the mathematical possibilities?
ALVY: You're an actor, Max. You should be doing Shakespeare in the Park.
ROB: Oh, I did Shakespeare in the Park, Max. I got mugged. I was playing Richard the Second and two guys with leather jackets stole my leotard.
ALVY: Max, are we driving through plutonium?
ROB: Keeps out the alpha rays, Max. You don't get old.
ACTOR: You're a thinking person. How can you choose this lifestyle?
ACTRESS: What is so incredibly great about New York? It's a dying city! You-you read Death in Venice"."
ACTOR: You didn't read Death in Venice" till I gave it to you!"
ACTRESS: Well, you only give me books with the word death" in the title."
ACTOR: It's an important issue.
ACTRESS: Alvy, you are totally incapable of enjoying life.
ACTRESS: You're like New York. You're an island.
ACTOR: Okay, if that's all that we've been through together means to you, I guess it's better if we just said goodbye, once and for all! You know, it's funny, after all the serious talks and passionate moments that it ends here... in a health food restaurant on Sunset Boulevard. Goodbye, Sunny.
