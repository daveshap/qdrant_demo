Helped me
Hi. I have been dealing with depression for most of my life. I have frequent thoughts of suicide. One thing I found that has helped me greatly is knitting. The repetition of the stitches helps keep me grounded. I usually make something for someone else and it makes me happy to do that. A lot of hospitals will take small hats for the preemies. If you start out with something easy (like a scarf) and work your way to more challenging pieces it makes a difference. There are a TON of videos on YouTube about beginner knitting. You can purchase inexpensive yarn and needles online. Give it a try!
