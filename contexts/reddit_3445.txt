I love getting ghosted
Yes you heard that right. Ghost me I will not care! I will not double text you! I will not be sad about it! Why? Because why the HELL would I want to continue trying to pursue someone who obviously isn't interested in me? When someone ghosts me I say YAY now I know that me and this person aren't meant to be, so now I'm one step closer to finding someone who is. I'm never going to let someone make me question if I'm pretty enough, interesting enough, or smart enough for them. If they decide they don't want to pursue me anymore they can be my guest. I'm a 19 year old girl and I'm proud of myself for realizing this now, and not letting every rejection turn my world upside down. :)
