How do people just keep dating despite all the setbacks?
I really hope someone responds to this cause I’m genuinely curious and want to hear people’s opinions.


I took a break. Even un joined this thread because I really just wanted to move on with my life.

I ask this because I stopped dating due to insecurities and pitfalls I had personally. I feel that I need to gain my confidence again. I don’t want to project my problems onto someone else nor do I want to be anxious to be exclusive with someone when in reality I should relax and let it be. (I usually do this because I don’t like being one of many women lol but anyhow)

How do you few really just keep going? I used to have that confidence but at the same time I, dating from one person to another kind of made me feel uncomfortable.

I see all the past people I dated finding either happiness in themselves or finding someone stable without freaking out and just enjoying themselves. While I’m happy for them I find myself jealous too.

I’m finding happiness within myself now but I really do have to ask.. how do you get to that point where you aren’t anxious for someone to text back, you aren’t paranoid about never finding anyone, and etc etc?

When does that feeling end?
