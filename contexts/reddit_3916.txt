I’m fed up with this crap
How can you text me something like that and then just not respond to me?! I am so sick of playing games, I just want a dude to be straight up with me and not jerk me around and “care” but then not step up when I reciprocate. I think I need to step back from dating and just work on everything else going on in my life, but I cared about him! I’m willing to make time for him because I want to see him, and it’s just either not enough or someone else has come along and they’re a better option. I’m tired of my emotions being played with. I don’t do games and I’m tired of the dating game. Don’t tell me you like hanging out with me and want to see me more if it’s not true on your end.

EDIT: this was just supposed to be a rant post to the void so my anxiety brain could calm down a little, none of y’all were supposed to really see this. Solidarity to my people going through the same stuff
