REEF: I guess Skipper Neilsen re- tired before you enrolled at the Academy, didn't he?
DAVE: I guess.
REEF: One of the finest men, and officers, alive. A real hero - in the best sense of the word - in World War Two. He taught us Engineering and Design. Fought like a demon to develop atom subs.
DAVE: So?
REEF: So all of a sudden his only son drops out of school, be- gins making noises like a pacifist. A real egghead, do-gooder, and crackpot! 'Ban the atom tests! Junk the nuclear subs! Spend the mili- tary budgetfor peace!'
DAVE: A lot of people think like that.
REEF: But <u>they're</u> not Skipper Neilsen's son! It broke his heart. Then when some newspapers called Carl 'the honest, sincere son of a war-mongering father' - Captain Neilsen resigned from the Navy. Oh, he still keeps his hand in - playing around with projects like the 'Lungfish' - but it broke him, all the same.
DAVE: Have you ever talked to Carl - tried to see his side?
REEF: 'His' side? I've seen it, all right. A nice, bright yellow!
