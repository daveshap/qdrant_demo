Have Ubuntu 18.04LTS installed, windows boot can't detect hard disk (possible GRUB issue) I have Ubuntu18.04LTS installed on my laptop. Now I want to install Windows 10 (via bootable usb) but it asks for hard disk driver in the part where hard disk needs to be partitioned. I think it may be related to Grub 2.2 and MBR (or maybe not, I'm not an expert). What can I do to install Windows 10? I'm ok with losing all my data and my Ubuntu.ps. actually I had Windows 10 on my laptop first. Then I installed Ubuntu but it messed up my Windows and I performed several \"boot-repair\" actions which did not repair it.
