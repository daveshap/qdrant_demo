Master's degree in Mechanical Engineering from the USA, or Canada?
Hello. I'm an international student that just graduated with my bachelor's from an American university. I'm looking into getting my master's degree in mechanical engineering and I'm very confused between getting it from either the USA or Canada. The program I'm looking into is available in both the countries so I'm not worried about that. My main concern is being able to get a job due to the vastly different job markets and the immigration of both the countries.

If anyone has any insight or advice that could help clear up my confusion please let me know. Thank you!
