I can't afford my textbooks.
I was recently accepted to ASU. My appointment with my advisor was today. She set up my schedule for me, and it's all online which helps a ton. The problem is I've been given three days to come up with a ton of money I don't have for textbooks that 1. are absolutely required because the course work is done from the book and 2. are exclusive to ASU so I can't buy them anywhere else and I can't find a place to download them. I'm freaking out, because I was all excited for going back to school, and now I might be completely screwed. I've emailed my advisor, but I highly doubt it'll do me any good. I can't magically make the money appear, and it's not really her job to do anything about that.
