DELACROIX: I would like to change your name.
MANRAY: To what?
DELACROIX: You're now Mantan.
MANRAY: Mantan? I don't even care as long as I'm dancing. Which reminds me, I need some new kicks.
MANRAY: I never had a really real pair before.
SLOAN: You've never had any formal training, either?
MANRAY: Not a class, not a thing, just picked stuff up by myself.
SLOAN: I wish I had your natural talent. God only makes that visit once in a while.
MANRAY: You sing and dance?
SLOAN: A little. I just graduated from NYU film school. Cinema studies.
MANRAY: So what's up with you and DeLa?
SLOAN: What do you mean?
MANRAY: Are you and him kicking it? Knocking boots. Y'knowwhatI'mtalkin'bout.
SLOAN: No, we're not knocking boots. I got this internship while I still was at NYU, DeLa was impressed with my get up and go and hired me to be his assistant.
MANRAY: I'm sure that was the only thing he was impressed with. You look beautiful like that.
SLOAN: If that was suppose to be a compliment, I thank you.
MANRAY: You're welcome. You shouldn't give up on performing.
SLOAN: Why do you say that? You've never seen me.
MANRAY: I think that would probably make you the happiest. When I'm hoofing, I mean really doing my thing, hitting it, nothing compares to that feeling in the world.
SLOAN: I envy you. That's the way I want to feel about my work.
