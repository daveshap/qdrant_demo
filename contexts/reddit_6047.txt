Would this be a good time to relocate for a new job?
 

Hey guys! So ever since I graduated college, I've wanted to move to a state that has plenty of nature, cooler climate, and outdoor activities. I am big into hiking, climbing and all that jazz. Living out here in Houston, I feel like I get none of that. So for the past 4 years, I have been working really hard in my current company (i work in finance). I have pretty much mastered SQL and a bunch of other analytic tools that seem to make me standout in my field. I took a stab at applying to a few companies out of state and it seems to be working. I have been getting interviews and even got to 3rd round with one company before turning it down due to salary (salary not being on par with the cost of living in that city). So that got me thinking, would this be a good time to relocate? I am pretty comfortable in my current role and I love my co-workers. I make a decent amount and I am living comfortably. However, I don't see myself long term in this company and I have lived in Houston most of my life. I am kind of tired of driving down same street I grew up on and honestly, I just want change. But in current climate, I still haven't found a company I really want to work for, in a state I want. It's probably due to COVID forcing companies to freeze hiring. Even then, would it be smart to relocate for a new company right now? There are talks of a second wave of Covid hitting in fall and with 2020 being already rocky; I am afraid that I might get furloughed once I relocate. So there is already an underlying risk on top of all the stuff that comes with a new company/relocation. What would be your opinion on this?

TL;DR: I want to move out of state. But I'm scared that companies hiring right now might start furloughing employees if a second wave of covid hits. And I would be in a new state with no job....
