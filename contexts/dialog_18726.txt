BENI: My very good friend! What a surprise.
O'CONNELL: Why if it ain't my little buddy, Beni. I oughta kill you.
BENI: You never were any good with the ladies, O'Connell.
O'CONNELL: So you're the one leading the Americans, I shoulda figured. So what's the scam? You get 'em out in the middle of the desert then leave 'em to rot?
BENI: Unfortunately no, these Americans are smart, they pay me only half now, half when I get them back to Cairo, so I must go all the way.
