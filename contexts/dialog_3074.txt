FREEZE: Prepare for a bitter harvest. Winter has come at last.
IVY: Not good.
BRUCE: Alfred, are you...?
ALFRED: Rather disappointed at how poorly I taught you proper housekeeping. And quite well, it seems. Thanks to you, son. Thanks to you all.
DICK: One question. When Batgirl and I rolled off the telescope, how come you didn't try and save us? It was the first time I fell and you weren't there to catch me.
BRUCE: I knew you could handle it.
BRUCE: Sometimes counting on someone else is the only way to win.
BARBARA: Hey, I'm the one who kicked Ivy's botanical butt. Personally. Me. I did.
BRUCE: You are going back to school.
