Is it possible to create a limitless power by firing rocks from the moon to Earth? Here is my idea for a limitless* power. A gun on the moon fires moon rocks towards the Earth. The moon rocks fall in Earths gravity picking up speed and smash into Earth's atmosphere generating huge amounts of energy which is collected. Some of this energy is then fired by lasers back to the gun on the moon.Is this in anyway a feasible way to generate energy? What are some of the hurdles?Perhaps instead of rocks, the gun could fire ionised particles from moon dust.(*For all intents and purposes. Say, for a few millennia.)
