WILLCOX HILLYER: Excuse me... your voice is familiar and I'm sure I know you from somewhere...
DAVE WILKIE: Awww-rr, Buddy, come on, you know me!
WILLCOX HILLYER: Well, I... I... ah-h, let's see...
DAVE WILKIE: It's Dave Wilkie! I'm Dave Wilkie, don't you remember me?
WILLCOX HILLYER: Oh. Oh, God. Of course, Dave, how are you?
DAVE WILKIE: Well, I am in the construction business, Buddy, and without braggin' I have done real good at it. There are those who wouldn't have expected that out of me. Right now I'm buildin' a giant motel unit near Alexandria, outside Washington, D.C. Not fi-nance, I'm on the construction side.
WILLCOX HILLYER: Well, that's interesting, Dave. I always liked Washington, it's a pretty town.
DAVE WILKIE: Oh, it's all right, beats Jew York. But the niggers have took it over, just like every other city we got, only worse.
