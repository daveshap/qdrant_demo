HEATHER: Same trees. They took Elly Kedward out to the same kind of trees.
COTTER: --I look and look in the tree, all I ever see, he's always there watching, that stupid owl, over and over--
HEATHER: --Cotter, where can I get on-line?
COTTER: --anywhere, anywhere, all up and live, all the time--fucking owl--
HEATHER: Cotter?
COTTER: Fucking owl!
HEATHER: You think it's possible the tree in the Parr foundation is the same one they tied Elly Kedward to?
COTTER: No idea--goddamitt!
HEATHER: Boy Kurth.
COTTER: Heather, does that look like Domini there?
HEATHER: Where?
COTTER: Down there in the Park.
