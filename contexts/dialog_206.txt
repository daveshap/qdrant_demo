FLOYD: I'm sorry, but I'm not sure I know what you mean.
SMYSLOV: Well, it's just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at Clavius.
FLOYD: Really?
SMYSLOV: Yes. Well, for one thing, whenever you phone the base, all you can get is a recording which repeats that the phone lines are temporarily out of order.
B20: CONTINUED
FLOYD: Well, I suppose they've been having a bit of trouble with some of the equipment.
SMYSLOV: Yes, well at first we thought that was the explanation, but it's been going on for the past ten days.
FLOYD: You mean you haven't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days?
SMYSLOV: That's right.
FLOYD: I see.
