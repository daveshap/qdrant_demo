HENRY: Victor. This has got to stop. Nobody's seen you in months. You haven't attended a single class.
VICTOR: I've been preoccupied.
HENRY: We all know how hard you took Waldman's death. Even Krempe is sympathetic. But it is time to move on. It is time to concern yourself with life.
VICTOR: That is my concern. I'm involved in something just now. I want to finish it in Waldman's memory.
HENRY: How much longer?
VICTOR: Few months perhaps. I'm gathering the raw materials even now.
