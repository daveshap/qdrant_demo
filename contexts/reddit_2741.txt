Why you shouldn't spend too much time worrying about your career?
Today I had a great discussion about choices and decisions. Whether you realize it or not, your life is made up of many choices. What you wear, how you style your hair, what to eat for breakfast, how your going to get to work, what your doing, etc. These choices can be traumatic to some. I know for me, it has been. 

Don't you find it funny that one wrong decision or choice can affect the outcome of your whole day, and it shouldn't be like that. How we ultimately decide what our motives and intents are at every turn and section of the day help to make up our life. Life is just a journey of wrong decisions, right decisions, bad choices, good choices, and missed opportunities. 

I've always wanted to make the right decision. The right decision for me is the one that progresses me, and opens up doors to my future. But the reasons I associate as a right decision are different from how another person might see their "right decision."

Life is short, enjoy the ride, and take it for what it is. There's no other way. Trust in your gut, your instinct, and it'll all work out.
