Potree Converter - adding to output folder later - duplicate names issue I use the Potree Converter (Windows application) to bulk convert .LAZ files and generate them into a (shared) output folder.  This works great, as each output file/folder generated is uniquely named.If I want to convert more .LAZ files in the future and save them to the same output folder, some of the generated output files get allocated the names for files that already exist in the output folder.  I have checked the file sizes of the duplicate files and they are different - indicating they are indeed different files.  I do not want to overwrite any files unless they are the same file (i.e. contain the same data).The only way around this issue I can see is to convert ALL the .LAZ files again - something that is obviously not practical - considering I have TBs worth of source .LAZ files.Could someone tell me if it is possible to \"add\" to the output folder ensuring the latest files generated have names unique to the output folder?As a very basic example, the shared directory contains the following files:r.hrcr.lazr0.lazIf I want to add to this directory later by converting some latest source data, chances are the above files will be re-created but for the latest source data.I do not wish to have to store the latest files in a new directory.
