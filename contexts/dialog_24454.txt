MORAN: ...comes off third cleat from the stern, port side. And it's brand new. Unlike the rest.
HOOKS: And the next one...?
MORAN: From Carl Heine's boat. All his were like this one, three-strand manila, new condition, braided in loops. Not bowlined like Miyamoto's.
HOOKS: And the last...?
MORAN: Found on Carl's boat, too. Starboard side, second cleat from the stern. But it doesn't match Carl's lines. It matches Miyamoto's. perfect.
HOOKS: So if defendant had tied up to deceased's boat. With that last one. Would those cleats have lined up?
MORAN: You bet. And if Miyamoto there had been in a hurry to cast off, he coulda left this line behind on Carl's boat.
HOOKS: And replaced it later with the new one. That's your inference?
MORAN: Pretty darn clear.
