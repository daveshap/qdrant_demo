Was made fun of for not being circumcised :(
I was talking with other people about different inventions from people and someone mentioned that Jewish people invented circumcision. I told them I wasn't circumcised and then it all went downhill from there.

They called me a freak, they said I'll never have sex in my life and that nobody will ever want to be with me. Now all of a sudden I have a different perspective on life and I feel sad and unmotivated.

Edit: wow! Wasn't expecting this many responses. Thank you very much! I feel much better.
