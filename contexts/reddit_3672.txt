Yes, I have a full, interesting, busy life on my own. I am still allowed to not like being single.
Went out with my friend and her boyfriend last week and made a comment about how I haven’t had a date in a while. My friends boyfriend IMMEDIATELY started to say “Well you need to be happy on your own-“ 

I literally cut him off and said “I am already”

I have a dream full time job, a dream side hustle (shoutout r/RoverPetSitting), hobbies, friends, sports. I AM HAPPY ON MY OWN FOR PETES SAKE!!!!!
