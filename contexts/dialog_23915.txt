HANNAH: Mr. and Mrs. Parker have agreed to join their parcel to mine. We'll work them together. Mine starts right over there. It's all I've ever wanted. Pretty land, isn't it?
PADEN: And a pretty lady.
HANNAH: A lot of men have told me that. Maybe it's true. I guess some women are slow to believe it.
PADEN: Believe it.
HANNAH: They're drawn to me by that. But it never lasts.
PADEN: Why?
HANNAH: Because they don't like what I want.
PADEN: What's that?
HANNAH: I want to build something, make things grow. That takes hard work -- a lifetime of it. That's not why men come to a pretty woman.
