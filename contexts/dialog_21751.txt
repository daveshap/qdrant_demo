JAKE: This looks done.
IRMA: It's not done.
JAKE: It looks done. I'll take it the way it is.
IRMA: Here's your steak. You can't wait for it to be done. Here.
IRMA: Here's your carrots. You're in such a hurry. You can't wait.
JAKE: No, I can't wait. You know when I wait? When it's important to wait. It's not important to wait for no steak. It's important to wait for Reeves to leave the ring. It ain't important to wait for no steak! I won that fight. So, I stayed in the ring, and that way I made sure everybody knew it. I shoulda knocked him out earlier, sonofabitch.
