People that I see almost every day at school send me this on my YOLO, an anon app connected to Snapchat, and I don’t know what to do.
Hey y’all, I just hope one kind stranger gives some advice because I honestly don’t know what to do anymore. For context I’m a short, average looking (in my opinion) white girl with blonde hair and blue eyes. Classic American I know. I’m not popular by any means in school and I’m pretty sure this is a joke but it’s disgusting and disturbing and I don’t know what to do anymore. So anyway I’ve been getting messages like 

“Wanna masturbate with me” 

“Nice ass”

And

“U thicc, got them curves”

Which the latter(last one) of the two is relatively harmless compared to the first but those are just some of the most recent and I’m lazy. I know I could just delete the app but honestly I get a lot of positive stuff on there and I have a ton of amazing friends that don’t say stuff like that and I would love to be able to block the actual people saying that stuff on my snap but since it’s anonymous I can’t. I know I could block that user on yolo but I’m pretty sure it either “expires” after a while or there are ways around It. Anyway I would love any advice I can get.
