Today is my Birthday...
I turned 20 today. It's significant because I never thought I'd make 20. The last few years have been really rough and I can't count how many nights I thought about taking my own life. Yet here I am. I broke down in the shower just thinking about how close I was to not being here.

I start counselling soon and I'm going to make a big effort to try and turn my life around. I've spent long enough being miserable and I deserve to be happy. I hope on my next birthday I look back on this day proud of how far I've come. I hope that this is the last Birthday where I feel sad.
