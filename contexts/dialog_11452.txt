ROHNA: If you will wait one moment, sir.
KRINGELEIN: I won't wait -- I can't wait -- I waited three days before I got a room at all and what a room that is.
ROHNA: It's a very nice room and inexpensive, sir.
KRINGELEIN: Did I say I wanted a cheap room to live in -- when I came here did I ask for a cheap room? Did I?
ROHNA: Just one moment, sir.
KRINGELEIN: No, I won't wait -- I can't -- Every day is precious -- every hour -- Every minute.
