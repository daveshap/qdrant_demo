Loneliness and lack of intimate relationships
I want to meet a girl that would become my soulmate (I'm a guy). It's hard. Ridiculously hard. I am in my late teens and am living in a foreign country. Not particularly attractive, maybe average looking at best. The problem is that I just keep thinking about that all the time. Fuck. Even doing my hobbies, which I enjoy a lot,  feels like I'm trying to escape and compensate for not having an intimate relationship with a person of opposite sex. I lack companionship so much, even though I socialize a fair amount and have a lot of friends (albeit mostly male). It gets unbearable sometimes. Not even sure what my problem is to be honest. Stumbling upon all those "I met a girl..." and such stories makes me feel like shit because it seems like it will never ever happen to me. I thought that urge would go away, but it has only grown larger, and it's been eating me from the inside.
