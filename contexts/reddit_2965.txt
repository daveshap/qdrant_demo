Anyone Else With A Useless BA Try A Certification?
I have a lib arts BA and I'd like to try a certification program of some sort before I commit to something like a masters program.

I was thinking maybe paralegal? USF has a 3 month online program for people with BAs.

I am not looking to immediately make a lot of money. I just want an alternative to waiting tables :/

The one problem I will have is that I have an addiction past. I am not technically a convicted felon, but my background isn't squeaky clean, so I dont want to complete a program and then not be able to find work because of my past. (Much, much more on this in comments)

Just looking for some advice.

Edit: Thank you for everyone taking the time to reply! I'm interested in many things, I'm open to all suggestions! Verbal/words are my strength. I have a Linguistics BA and an ESL Studies certification, and spent time as a copywriter. I also had a temp cert to teach middle and high school English, but it dropped. I do not want to teach. Nobody should have to deal with teaching in FL. My weakness is theoretical math. But yeah, I'm just looking for something that isnt as heavy a committment as a masters program. All ideas appreciated!
