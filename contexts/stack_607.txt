Can't login Ubuntu 16.04 (Gnome) after logout Problem is that if keyboard layout is set to Russian when screen is locked I can't login using password input field. Only way is to press Switch User and then enter password for my current user.But if keyboard layout is set to English when screen is locked everything is OK and I can login normally.Yes, I've checked keyboard layout before entering password.It is set to En. But it makes no sense when I'm trying to change it on locked screen.I use Ubuntu 16.04 with Gnome.I've checked it on different PCs and on different Virtual machines, the result is the same - can't login when screen is locked with keyboard layout set to Russian and all works normally when it is English or any other English-like keyboard layout. And all woks fine if I press Switch user and log in from start page (the page with password prompt you see when starting PC).Only idea I have is that language in screen lock don't changes to English from Russian even when you switch manually. How to fix that? Any workarounds of fixes?
