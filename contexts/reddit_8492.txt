What are the pros and cons of holding the possible New York Constitutional Convention?
This year, [as is required every 20 years,](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/05/nyregion/constitutional-convention-voting-new-york.html) New Yorkers will vote on whether to hold a constitutional convention to amend or replace the current [New York State Constitution.](https://www.dos.ny.gov/info/constitution.htm)

The [Rockefeller Institute has laid out some issues such a convention might address.](http://www.rockinst.org/nys_concon2017/Issues.aspx) though it would have broad power to propose anything the delegates wanted, with the final product needing to be approved by the state's voters [at the 2018 general election.](http://www.rockinst.org/nys_concon2017/Timeline.aspx)

So what are the pros and cons of holding a convention?  What successes or failures have come from past conventions?  What major positive or negative changes might come about from a convention?
