JACOB: What's it say? A hundred and two?
JEZZIE: I don't believe this. I'm calling the doctor.
JACOB: What does it say?
JEZZIE: It's gone to the top.
JACOB: How high is that?
JEZZIE: The numbers stop at 107.
JACOB: What the hell are you doin'?
JEZZIE: Get your clothes off.
JACOB: What are you talking about? I'm freezing.
JEZZIE: Get your clothes off!
JACOB: What'd the doctor say?
JEZZIE: That you'd die on the way to the hospital. Now get into that tub.
JEZZIE: He's coming right over.
JACOB: Coming here?
JEZZIE: Goddamn it. Get in here. I can't stand around waiting.
JACOB: You're out of your mind. I'm not getting in there. I'd rather die.
JEZZIE: That's your decision.
JACOB: Look at me. I'm ice cold.
JEZZIE: You're red hot, damn it. Get in there. I've got to get more ice.
