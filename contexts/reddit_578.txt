How should I convince my parents to let me hang out with friends?
Recently a girl my age moved a couple blocks away from my house and we became frinds. My mom wont let hang out with her and I am really anoyed. How should I convince her to let me hang out with friends. I am 13 btw and we live in a safe neighborhood.

I have been getting so much anxiety from this because i build up the courage to ask my mom and she says no and then i feel bad and have to tell her no and i have been so stressed becasue i feel like my mom should trust me. I dont do the kind of stuff the kids at my school do and I have all A+ or A- grades. Please help me
