OLIVER: Where did you get it?
ALICE: Amy picked it off the top of that stack. Perhaps you'd better go through the whole bunch. There may be others of Irena in there.
ALICE: Some day I'm afraid we're going to have to tell her about Irena.
OLIVER: I suppose so.
AMY: Who are you?
IRENA: You called me by my name.
AMY: Irena. But who are you?
IRENA: I'm your friend.
AMY: I've wanted a friend.
IRENA: I've wanted a friend too. I've been lonely.

AMY: Yes, yes! I see Prince,
IRENA: That's right!
AMY: This is more fun than just pretend.
IRENA: Of course,
ALICE: What's funny?
OLIVER: That darn kid. I never in my life expected her to get an A in arithmetic. Math's is a practical science --- if she understands figures, she's well out of her own world of make-believe.
IRENA: There's an oak leaf. Add a maple.
AMY: That one's an elm.
IRENA: light shining) in her eyes) Throw sea weeds into the flames, and the fire turns blue!
AMY: But we don't have any sea weed.
IRENA: Pretend, darling. It's All Soul's Eve. Round about the fire we go... Over the flames we leapt
