Anyone else get this vague, stressful feeling that you have some insurmountable task ahead of you tomorrow, or something similar?
So this may sound a bit vague so bear with me. Often times when I'm feeling incredibly stressed out, over no particular reason, I often get this feeling of stress over the immediate future. It feels like I have some incredibly taxing and difficult task ahead of me the next day and it makes me feel cripplingly anxious and stressed out in the present. 

To me it sort of feels like I have a final exam(or something similar) to do tomorrow, every single day. This is despite the fact that I actually dont have anything stressful to do tomorrow. 

Anyone else get this specific feeling?
