MUMFORD: Dr. Delbanco. It's nice to see you again.
DELBANCO: I don't think you know Dr. Sheeler. She's the other therapist here in town.
MUMFORD: Of course... I've heard great things about you.
SHEELER: Thank you.
DELBANCO: You never got back to me. ...I called to say we'd like to take you out for a meal?... Kind of a professional welcome.
MUMFORD: Forgive me, please. What a gracious thought. We must do that.
SHEELER: When?
MUMFORD: Why don't I call you when I've got my calendar in front of me?
DELBANCO: What are you doing for lunch?
MUMFORD: Right now?
