WARFIELD: Tone down our headlines? Lacy, that's all the common man reads!
LACY: I'd just like to have a little less sensationalism.
WARFIELD: Less sensational papers go broke. I thought I taught you long ago the business of newspapers is business.
LACY: No, Daddy. Our business is journalism. We can't continue to be so irresponsible . . . or else we'll just lead everyone into a disaster.
WARFIELD: Don't be over-dramatic, young lady. What kind of disaster could we help bring about?
