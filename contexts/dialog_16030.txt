SPANKY: What's that, some of your bathtub brew?
RAY: Puerto Rican rum. See for yourself.
SPANKY: Where'd you get this?
RAY: Comes up the Mississippi. I can get more. A lot more. I was thinking about going into business for myself, but under the circumstances, I'd be willing to take on a partner.
SPANKY: I'm interested. Keep talking.
RAY: All I need is the front money and a truck. I could be back in two, three days tops if I had somebody to share the driving.
SPANKY: If you fuck me on this one, I'll spare no expense.
RAY: Understood.
SPANKY: Alright, Ray, you've got a deal. Pick your man and get going.
RAY: I'll take the little choirboy, if you don't mind.
SPANKY: If I was you, I'd want somebody who can handle himself in a tight spot.
RAY: I just want somebody who won't put a bullet in my back once the truck is full.
