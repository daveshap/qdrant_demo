Has anyone here ever landed a desirable job by accident or just by being in the right place at the right time? If so, what happened, and how did it turn out?
The 1990s American sitcom *Seinfeld* once featured an episode (S08E03, "The Bizarro Jerry") in which one of the main characters, Kramer, becomes employed at a firm called Brandt/Leland through a series of bizarre coincidences. If I recall correctly, he helps an employee with a copy machine while waiting for George outside the restroom, which leads to him being ushered into an urgent meeting by some unwitting office staff.  For the remainder of the episode, he works for Brandt/Leland for free before being "fired" by the supervisor for not delivering quality work.

To be sure, this story seems downright fantastical in 2019 (the episode aired in October 1996), but has anyone here ever had a similar experience, or known someone who did? If so, how did it happen, and what was the end result?
