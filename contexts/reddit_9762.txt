Gender neutral titles and forms of address in student affairs?
So I just interviewed with a school last week and realized both while interviewing and as I'm working on those thank you cards, I'm not sure how to address folks.

I know it's context-dependent, but should I be going with their first name, or is that too familiar? Is there a widely-recognized gender-neutral salutation such as "M. Lastname" that I could use? Stupid little question, but I'd appreciate any thoughts.
