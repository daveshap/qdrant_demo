LILY: Darling, then let's be honest and return it to the lady.
GASTON: And take the twenty thousand francs ...
LILY: Right.
GASTON: Sweetheart, what day is today?
LILY: The fourteenth of May.
GASTON: And tomorrow is the fifteenth. And the day after tomorrow--
LILY: The six--
GASTON: We'll go to Venice, to the same hotel!
LILY: We'll take the Royal Suite!
GASTON: Two fifty-three, five--
LILY: Seven and nine!
GASTON: And we'll celebrate the second anniversary of the day we didn't get married!
LILY: Darling!
