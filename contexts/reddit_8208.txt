Can Trump "shut down the government"?
At last night's rally in Phoenix, Trump threatened to "shut down the government" if he doesn't get funding for the wall he wants to build.

According to [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-idUSKCN1B211U),  he said:

"If we have to close down our government, we're building that wall. We're going to have our wall. The American people voted for immigration control. We're going to get that wall." 

Does he have the authority to do this? 
What are the implications of this, if he does this?
Has this been done before?
