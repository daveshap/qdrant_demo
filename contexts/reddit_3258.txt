How does anyone survive working? (Can't stand it anymore)
Is it some big secret by nearly all people in the working world that it literally sucks? Am I doing it wrong. Have been in my job for 5 years, completely drains my soul and I feel 120% dead inside robot. It seems so hard to get a head, I thought good solid work would achieve that then I entered the world of multi direction office politics and multi layered management that don't communicate with each other. It seems like 99% of places operate this way. 

I not sure any job is going to be different. I can't stand being told what to do by someone else just because they are the boss and spend all day doing something I don't care about for someone who is only interested in their own goals. You need to work to live but you can't enjoy living if you are working, even if you do work the cost of living is so high you never get anywhere and struggle to even keep your head above water. It's not enjoyable. 

I can't even enjoy the weekends sometimes. Seriously I'm done. I don't even wear a seatbelt on the way to work anymore. Am I doing it wrong? What am I missing?
