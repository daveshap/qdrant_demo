MARY: I hope to Christ she doesn't expect us to wear these things.
BILL: Whatever it is just do it. The more we play along the faster we'll get the hell out of here.
DENISE: Really, now is not the time to make waves.
JERRY: Hey, I'm just waiting for Cousin Itt to show up.
DENISE: Shhhhhh.
DENISE: You sure you don't need any help in there?
MOTHER: No dear, I'm fine. Now what kind of host would I be if I put my guests to this kind of work.
BABY: Ma, Tiny's in.
MOTHER: Go tell him to get your Grandpa.
