FISHER: Fuck! Fuck you fucking guys!
BOYD: Well we can definitely call the police. That's an easy call. If we call the police...What happens? They find a dead prostitute in the bathroom...They ask us...What happened? We say, ah...our friend, Micheal... Your brother...got a little out of control...they were making love...and he got a little excited...and he, ah, sort of beat her head into the side of a toilet, while he choked her to death with a rubber hose...
ADAM: Stop it!
BOYD: There's more.
ADAM: Just stop.
BOYD: Just giving the facts.
ADAM: I'm calling the police.
BOYD: What were we doing officer? Why didn't we help her? Well...we're all a bit high, you know, bachelor party, that kind of thing. Fisher here is getting married in three days...Beautiful wife ...he didn't have anything at all to do with it...It was all Micheal here... just Micheal...
