I wanted to thank you guys!
A few days ago, some of you may remember I posted about thinking I was going into the void of depression and was suicidal. Well, I wanted to say I'm feeling a little better. 

A couple of days before I posted I'd suffered a severe head injury. What I didn't know at the time was that severe depression can be caused or complicated by a concussion. Part of my sudden depth of feeling was down to the concussion, which was making me teary and have a breakdown at work. 

Well my boss sat with me and telling me I wasn't worthless until my mum picked me up and was able to get me a doctors appointment where they explained that whilst not causing the depression the sudden urge to self harm etc might be caused by the temporary instability. So I'm booked in to get some help with the underlying depression in the next couple of weeks. In the mean time i'm trying what I can to feel okay, exercising and finding things to be thankful for. 

So thanks for suggesting things to help, and thanks for being here for people!
