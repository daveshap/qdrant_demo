HILDA: You should see it, Professor Barnhardt! You should go out and see it for yourself!
BARNHARDT: Thanks -- I'm enjoying it right here.
HILDA: The whole city has stopped. People are running around like ants!
BARNHARDT: What a brilliant idea. I never would have thought of it.
BARNHARDT: What about the people who are coming to the meeting tonight? Have they all arrived?
HILDA: I talked to most of them this morning... They were all very curious about the meeting.
BARNHARDT: Good. Did you speak to our friend Mr. Carpenter?
HILDA: He'll be there at 8:30.
BARNHARDT: Tell me, Hilda -- does all this frighten you -- does it make you feel insecure?
HILDA: Yes, sir -- it certainly does!
BARNHARDT: That's good, Hilda. I'm glad.
