Confusion in \"-ing\" form verbs use I am reading Jane Eyre book published by Oxford Bookworms. I have found this sentence: ...,while I lay awake all night, trembling with fear, and eyes wide open in horror, imagining ghosts in every corner. I do not know when to use \"-ing\" like trembling and imagining. There is no (be verbs) before them and I cannot distinguish any relative clauses (I know be verbs can be omitted in some cases when there is relative clause.). Would you please guide me a bit in this case? Thank you in advance
