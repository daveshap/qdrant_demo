ASSISTANTS: Fine -- terrible.
KAFKA: What was the matter with it?
OSKAR: He can't sit still. Just when we arrive at a nightclub he wants to go to another one.
LUDWIG: You look tired.
OSKAR: Gabriela Rossman was here looking for you. Do you know her?
KAFKA: Do you?
OSKAR: We saw her naked once -- didn't we.
LUDWIG: Women are all you have on your mind!
OSKAR: She went to the roof to sunbathe one lunch hour -- we watched her changing.
KAFKA: I didn't realize you'd been here that long.
OSKAR: You mean because it's been a while since there was a sunny day? What a good detective you are.
LUDWIG: They keep switching us from department to department. He doesn't mind because he can't sit still.
OSKAR: We used to be in the supply section, carrying boxes of medicine about but we dropped too many of them.
LUDWIG: It's not too bad working here.
