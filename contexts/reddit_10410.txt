I always wonder how it feels to live a happy life
I’ve been depressed for so long i can’t even remember how it feels to be consistently happy and okay with life. I want to know the feeling of enjoying my life and it’s crazy to think that most people around me have a mostly happy life and here i am thinking about suicide every few hours of the day. It’s also crazy how you don’t even know if someone might be feeling the same as you. I hope everyone reading this has a great day

Edit: I didn’t really think this many people would see this and comment, but it’s nice to know i’m not alone. I hope everyone finds what they are looking for and gets through the struggles in your lives.
