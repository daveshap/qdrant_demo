CHANG: You know, it's very, very strange, but when you saw me in the corridor, I was actually on my way to you. I bring the most amazing news. The High Lama wishes to see you, Mr. Conway.
LOVETT: The High Lama! Who in blazes is he?!
BARNARD: Yeah. I though you ran this joint.
CONWAY: Mr. Chang - High Lamas or Low Lamas, do we get the porters?
CHANG: The High Lama is the only one from whom any information can come.
GEORGE: Don't believe him, Bob. He's just trying to get out.
LOVETT: Yes.
BARNARD: Sounds like a stall to me.
CONWAY: One moment. You say the High Lama is the only one who can give us any information?
CHANG: The only one.
CONWAY: And he can arrange for the porters to take us back?
CHANG: The High Lama arranges everything, Mr. Conway.
CONWAY: Well, then he's the man I want to see. Will you come along?
