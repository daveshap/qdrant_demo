Should you go to an interview 45 minutes early?
NO!

Sure get to the building an hour or 45 minutes early if you have no idea where you are going or are taking public transit. But don't go IN until MAXIMUM 20 minutes prior, ideally 10 minutes before, showing you are prompt but not overzealous.

And then if you DO go in early and the administrator/receptionist tells you it's in your best interest to take off and come back 10-15 minutes prior to your interview BELIEVE THEM! Sure you can wait there but you are going to look awkward as fuck and if it's a good place HR will ask that person what vibe they got off you. 'Arrived very early and then didn't trust my advice about the company I work for' isn't going to fly.

You don't have to go buy a coffee. Hell go wait in the lobby of another office building ( who cares if THEY think you are odd) but don't sit for 40+ minutes in the lobby of the company you want to work for.

Edit: okay I'm not going to respond to everyone or anything, y'all can read comment or the billion articles on this shit. If you have basic North American office rules and found a job without it then great for you. I too have arrived at the building of my interview an hour early ( public transit) and then gone elsewhere to wait. Honestly I expected like 3 upvotes or downvotes and then for this thread to die. I was just blowing off steam.

Here's the golden rule. If the administrator/receptionist tells you to make yourself scarce until x amount of time prior DO IT. They are VERY unlikely to have any interest in you failing and know their office better than you do, listen to them.
