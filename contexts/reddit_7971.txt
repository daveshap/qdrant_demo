Money, loans, tuition advice
Hi everyone! I will begin a doctorate program this fall and I am just overwhelmed with dealing with the anticipated costs of everything. I received my financial aid information today and I will only be getting loans. 
What have you done or what are your plans to lower the stress of loans and the overall cost of graduate school?
