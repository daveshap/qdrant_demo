The power of an EM wave is proportional to the amplitude (squared). But also the frequency? The power of an electromagnetic wave is proportional to its amplitude squared. (Watts, usually)But, it is also proportional to its frequency, correct?  The higher the frequency, the greater? ( measured in eV).Is the TOTAL strength of the wave it's watts and electron-volts combined?So, what is the difference between a laser, say, with a large number of infrared photons versus an x-ray laser with fewer photons, but higher frequency?  They have the same total energy, but do they cut the same?  Can a low-frequency laser beam, if intense enough, ionized atoms and molecules like individual photons of x-rays do?
