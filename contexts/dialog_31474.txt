WALTER: What's up?
LUCAS: Have a seat.
LUCAS: You don't know?
WALTER: I have no idea.
LUCAS: I think you do.
WALTER: Why don't you just tell me?
WALTER: I haven't broken any laws.
LUCAS: Then you won't mind if I look around.
WALTER: I would.
LUCAS: Got something to hide?
WALTER: Doesn't everybody?
LUCAS: I could get a search warrant.
WALTER: If you could, you would have brought one today.
LUCAS: Cherry?
WALTER: Yeah.
LUCAS: Unusual design for a contemporary piece.
WALTER: It's not for sale.
LUCAS: Who said I wanted to buy it?
