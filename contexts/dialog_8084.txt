MERRICK: This... is my new home?
TREVES: Yes.
MERRICK: The hospital?
TREVES: Of course! What did you think?
MERRICK: How long will I stay here?
TREVES: I promise you. You will never see the inside of that horrible place again. You will never, ever go back to the workhouse... or that man. It's a splendid room, don't you think?
