OLIVER: Why don't you take off your hat and stay awhile?
ALICE: I forgot I had it on.
OLIVER: Where is everybody?
ALICE: It's early yet.
OLIVER: It's nearly a quarter after four. The party was for four, wasn't it?
ALICE: Yes, darling,
OLIVER: Gosh, in my day kids arrived at birthday parties before anybody was ready for them,
ALICE: Times have changed.
ALICE: Oilie, that's for the children to play with.
OLIVER: No kids yet. Something's gone wrong. Maybe I ought to call somebody.
ALICE: All right, Ollie. Go ahead. Call the Boyds...3000W...see if their darling Donald has left.
OLIVER: I think I should. 3000W?
ALICE: That's right.
OLIVER: Something's haywire,
ALICE: What do you mean?
OLIVER: I called not only the Boyds but the Irvings. Neither of them received invitations.
ALICE: But they must have. Amy and I made them out together. You mailed them, didn't you, Edward?
EDWARD: Well, ma'am, the truth is, I gave them to Amy hersolf to post.
OLIVER: And Amy mailed them?
EDWARD: She pleaded so to do it
OLIVER: Amy, you remember the party invitations Edward, gave you to mail?
AMY: Yes, daddy.
OLIVER: Did you mail then?
AMY: Yes, I did.
OLIVER: Where did you mail them?
AMY: I'll show you.
OLIVER: Amy, not that old tree!
AMY: Yes, daddy.
OLIVER: But I told you about that so long ago; you couldn't have been more than three when I told you that tree was a magic mailbox.
AMY: I didn't forget.
OLIVER: But, Amy, that was just a story; it wasn't real. That tree's no mailbox.
