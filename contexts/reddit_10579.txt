72, Female, Helpless, Useless and Unable to Cope
I am 72.  Last year my husband of 50 years decided to divorce me.  I have total income of $1100.00.  Can't find a residence for less than $850.inclluding utilities.  Don't know how to be poor.  Have debts that are huge.  Have no living family.  Soon won't be eating and don't care to go to the food bank.  Social Services won't help because I have 10K in the bank.  I've had and been treated for depression since I was 15.  The meds work OK normally, but these are not normal times for me.  I can't last much longer.  I struggle each night to not finish it all.  One night it will be too strong an urge.  I look forward to that day.
