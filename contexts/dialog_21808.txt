MOTHER: Rose, you're in an awful dither tonight. What's the matter with you, honey, are you sick or something?
ROSE: No, ma'am, I'm just fine.
MOTHER: You look sick if you ask me. I hate to leave you with the dishes and all, but I'm supposed to go to a meeting of the Garden Club this evening. I'll need the car keys.
DADDY: I'll drive you, darlin'. You've got no business behind the wheel of an automobile. You don't think about what you're doing and you'll run into a telephone pole.
MOTHER: I think about what I'm doing all the time, and I've got as much business behind the wheel of an automobile as anybody. Besides, I want you to stay and help Rose with the dishes, the poor girl isn't feeling well.
DADDY: All right, darlin'.
