Just realized I have no social life. Help?
So, i'm a junior and go to an all boys school. My parents have been making me focus so hard on my school work that my social life is nonexistant

Now, they're less strict as they assume I'll stay in line. I figure, this is my chance to live a bit as a teenager. Problem is, i lost contact with all of the people I used to be friends with. I have a group of pretty cool guy freinds, but i need to start getting friends outside of school, making friends with girls, and i feel the need to start dating. Any tips?
