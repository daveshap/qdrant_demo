Better to take longer with less debt or finish more quickly and earn more?
I’m starting an online MPA program this fall. I’m planning on working full time while I do it, but I can’t decide if I should do FT or PT school. My income is low enough that I’ll still need loans to cover the actual tuition, but if I do PT and take 1 course/ semester then I’ll cut the end amount of debt almost in half. I can’t decide if it’s worth it, though, since that would mean spending more than double the time on the degree, but with way less debt (and probably stress). Does anyone have experience with this internal debate?
