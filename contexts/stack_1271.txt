Azek PVC deck boards with Joist Tape? I bought the Azek PVC boards from a local store and I am starting to install the boards soon. I am using pressure treated for the frame, the store I bought the board suggested to use \"Joist Tape\" to protect the wooden joists. But when I read further details on the production information on the Joist tape (Resisto Joist Guard). They said the membrane composed of \"Elastomeric Bitumen\" and they said \"It is not recommended to use a product containing bitumen directly on softwood boards or flexible polyvinyl chloride\".  From the joist tape product, the technology is \"SBS modified bitumen\the surface that making contact with the Azek PVC is actually \"High density polyethylene\" not bitumen. That is confusing.  The underface is \"self-adhesive Silicone release film\".  Just wondering if it is safe to use these joist tapes? Or is there any other brand that is compatible with Azek PVC that will not void the warranty? Thanks a lot.
