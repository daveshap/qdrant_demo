Hillary's opponents label her crooked. Would an impartial review of the evidence at hand justify that label?
I see discussions both here at /r/NeutralPolitics and elsewhere on Reddit and the internet that state matter of factly that Hillary is known to be a corrupt or crooked politician (even Hillary-voters, who counter by claiming that Trump is worse). However, to my knowledge she or her husband has never been successfully convicted (nor sued?) of anything - despite decades in the public eye and [decades of allegations of corruption](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/07/tracking-the-clinton-controversies-from-whitewater-to-benghazi/396182/). 

Is there evidence that an impartial review would accept to suggest that she is, in fact, corrupt or crooked or has bad morals? What evidence is there to the contrary?
