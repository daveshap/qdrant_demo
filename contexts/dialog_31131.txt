SAM: Kelly...
KELLY: Drop dead... You know where my mom is trying to get the money to pay you off? She's trying to break my trust. How do you like that? I can't touch it until she's dead and she won't give me a dime and now she's trying to break it to pay you...
SAM: Look, Kelly... I'm sorry... I know what you've been through... I should've seen something like this coning.
