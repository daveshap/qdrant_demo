MIDGE: It's a brassiere. You know about those things. You're a big boy, now.
SCOTTIE: I've never run across one like that.
MIDGE: It's brand new. Revolutionary uplift. No shoulder straps, no back straps, but does everything a brassiere should do. It works on the principle of the cantilever bridge.
SCOTTIE: Uh-huh!
MIDGE: An aircraft engineer down the peninsula designed it. He worked it out in his spare time.
SCOTTIE: What a pleasant hobby.
SCOTTIE: How's your love life, Midge?
MIDGE: That's following a train of thought.
SCOTTIE: Well?
MIDGE: Normal.
SCOTTIE: Aren't you ever going to get married?
MIDGE: You know there's only one man in the world for me, Johnny-O.
SCOTTIE: Yeah, I'm a brute. We were engaged once though, weren't we?
MIDGE: Three whole weeks.
SCOTTIE: Ah, sweet college days. But you're the one who blew it. I'm still available. Available Ferguson. Say, Midge, do you remember a guy at college named Gavin Elster?
MIDGE: Gavin? Gavin Elster? You'd think I'd would. No.
SCOTTIE: I got a call from him today. Funny. He dropped out of sight during the war, and I'd heard he'd gone East. I guess he's back. It's a Mission number.
MIDGE: That's Skid Row... isn't it?
SCOTTIE: Could be.
MIDGE: He's probably on the bum and wants to touch you for the price of a drink.
SCOTTIE: Well, I'm on the bum; I'll buy him a couple of drinks and tell him my troubles. But not tonight. If you won't drink with me, I'll drink alone, tonight.
MIDGE: Sorry, old man. Work.
SCOTTIE: Midge, what did you mean, there's no losing it?
MIDGE: What.
SCOTTIE: My... the acrophobia.
MIDGE: I asked my doctor. He said only another emotional shock could do it, and probably wouldn't. And you're not going to go diving off another rooftop to find out.
SCOTTIE: I think I can lick it.
MIDGE: How?
SCOTTIE: I've got a theory. Look. If I can get used to heights just a little at a time... progressively see?
SCOTTIE: Here, I'll show you what I mean. We'll start with this.
MIDGE: That!?!
SCOTTIE: What do you want me to start with -- the Golden Gate Bridge?
SCOTTIE: Now. I look up, I look down. I look up, I look down. Nothing to it.
MIDGE: Stop kidding. Wait a minute.
