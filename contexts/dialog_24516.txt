SNOW: We can liquidate the station. Take the Athena back.
KELVIN: No.
SNOW: Of course, when we return, we'll be regarded as lunatics if we tell the truth. We'll chalk it up to isolation, collective derangement.
KELVIN: I've never heard you express any desire to leave before now. Why now?
SNOW: Well, I think we're reaching the point of diminishing returns here, right? Certainly it's learning more about us than we'll ever learn about it.
KELVIN: But why is it doing what it's doing? Given it's resources, it could have done anything. Presented me with your double, and you with mine.
SNOW: Perhaps it did.
KELVIN: Human beings can die.
SNOW: But they are human. They certainly become human with incredible speed. First they're like they were in our memory, but then they fill in on their own. DNA doesn't determine the hundreds of trillions of connections that occur in the brain, it's not dense enough. They build up with experience.
KELVIN: They come when you sleep.
SNOW: That's right. And we all have to sleep, eventually.
RHEYA: You don't want me.
KELVIN: Rheya.
RHEYA: That's what you were saying. I heard what you were saying.
KELVIN: For a reason that neither of us understand, you are forced to stay near me. That's all I know right now.
RHEYA: I have these strange thoughts, I don't know where they come from. I can't explain it.
KELVIN: Neither can I. Not any of it. There's no reference point for what's going on; it's never happened before. It's a clean break in the fabric of the Universe; a gap. There is nothing to do but experience it, moment-to- moment, and not let it destroy us.
RHEYA: But that's what happened before.
KELVIN: Not this time.
RHEYA: Do you want to stay here?
KELVIN: Do you?
RHEYA: If you're here.
KELVIN: Gibarian.
GIBARIAN: Leave the light off.
