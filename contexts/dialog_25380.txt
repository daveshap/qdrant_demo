SPOCK: Her own father...?
LT. SAAVIK: Such things have happened before, sir.
SCOTTY: They don't place the same value on life that we do, Spock - you know that... take my word: she didn't shed one bloody tear...
SPOCK: That's hardly conclusive, Mr. Scott, as Klingons have no tear ducts.
SPOCK: Any reply from Starfleet to our dispatch, Lieutenant.
LT. SAAVIK: Not as yet, sir.
SPOCK: Curious. You haven't been assisting Commander Uhura with her radio transmissions, have you, Lt?
LT. SAAVIK: Commander Uhura has been experiencing technical difficulties sir.
SPOCK: Very well. For twenty-four hours we'll agree that this conversation did not take place.
LT. SAAVIK: A lie?
SPOCK: An omission. After that -
SCOTTY: Twenty-four hours from now we won't have a clue where the Captain is.
SPOCK: I know precisely where he'll be.
