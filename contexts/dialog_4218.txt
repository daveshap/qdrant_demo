ALI: With an unloaded pistol?
KADER: I'll explain.
KADER: Let's suppose you were a spy. In prison, when the NLF contacts you, you pretend to support the revolution, and then the French help you to escape ...
ALI: Sure. By shooting at me.
KADER: Even that could be a trick. You escape, then show up at the address which the brothers in prison gave to you, and so you are able to contact me ...
ALI: I don't even know your name yet ...
KADER: My name is Kader, Ali ... Saari Kader ... In other words, in order to join the organization, you had to undergo a test. I could have told you to murder the barman, but he's an Algerian ... and the police would let you kill him, even though he is one of theirs. By obeying such an order, you still could have been a double agent. And that's why I told you to kill the French policeman: because the French wouldn't have let you do it. If you were with the police you wouldn't have done it.
ALI: But I haven't shot him.
KADER: You weren't able to. But what's important is that you tried.
ALI: What's important for me is that you let me risk my life for nothing.
KADER: C'mon ... you're exaggerating. The orders were to shoot him in the back.
ALI: I don't do that kind of thing.
KADER: Then don't complain.
ALI: You still haven't told me why you didn't let me kill him.
KADER: Because we aren't ready yet for the French. Before attacking, we must have safe places from which to depart and find refuge. Of course, there is the Casbah. But even the Casbah isn't safe yet. There are too many drunks, pushers, whores, addicts, spies ... people who talk too much ... people who are ready to sell themselves, undecided people. We must either convince them or eliminate them. We must think of ourselves first. We must clean out the Casbah first. Only then will we be able to deal with the French. Do you understand, Ali?
ALI: And how many are we?
KADER: Not enough.
