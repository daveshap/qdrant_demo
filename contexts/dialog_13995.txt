DAD: Jim -- what's wrong?!
JIMMY: You've got to come see -- a big thing went down over the hill!
JIMMY: It was big -- and it glowed -- and it went down over there -- behind the hill.
DAD: What did it look like?
JIMMY: It was -- it was -- it changed shape. First it was big and round, then it was flat, then it was long and thin.
DAD: Are you sure you saw that? In the rain -- it may have <u>looked</u> like it changed shape --
JIMMY: I don't know, Dad. But it was big.
DAD: I'll go take a look when the rain lets off.
MOM: What do you think he saw? Could it have been something from the air base?
JIMMY: No, Mom. It wasn't a plane.
