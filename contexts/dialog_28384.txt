BOUDREAU: Paltrow, Sterling, Furey, and the Big Alabama are in from New Orleans. Fiskin and the Boone Kid from Denver, and Phillips, Barnett and Limehouse Chappie from New York. Those and the guys outside should give ya 30 or so to choose from.
TWIST: Good, have 'em down at Stenner's old Pool Hall before 3:00. We're gonna run through the route tonight.
BOUDREAU: Okay, Twist, but you know if this blows up, I can't do ya no good downtown. Gondorff is Federal.
TWIST: Don't worry about it, pal.
SINGLETON: You in?
GONDORFF: Yeh, I think so. I gave the kay- ducer a C-note. You find out the deck?
SINGLETON: He usually plays with a Royal or a Cadenza. I got you one of each. He likes to cold deck low, 8's or 9's.
GONDORFF: Nice work, J.J.
