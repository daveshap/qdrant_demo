BARRY: Hey.
ROB: What the fuck is that?
BARRY: My band.
ROB: What band?
BARRY: The band that found me and asked me to join.
ROB: You are not in a band, Barry. You are not a musician. And no posters.
BARRY: Thanks for your support, Rob. Really appreciate it.
ROB: Barrytown. Barrytown? Is there no end to your arrogance?
BARRY: I didn't make up the name. It's the Steely Dan song. And it was in The Commitments.
ROB: You can't be called Barry and sing in a group called Barrytown.
BARRY: They were fucking called that before I was in it, okay? It wasn't my idea.
ROB: That's why you got the gig, isn't it?
ROB: Isn't it?
BARRY: That was one of the reasons they asked me to join originally, yes. But --
ROB: Great! That's fucking great! They only asked you to sing because of your name! You can stick it above the browser racks over there.
BARRY: How many tickets can I put you down for?
ROB: None. Christ!
BARRY: You're not even coming?
ROB: Of course I'm not coming. Do I look like I'd want to listen to some terrible experimental racket played in some hideous cave? Where is it? The fucking Bucktown Pub? Ha!
BARRY: So much for friends, then. You're a bitter bastard, Rob, you know that?
ROB: Bitter? Because I'm not in Barrytown? You should be shot like a lame horse, you jerk. Just keep that out of my window.
LAURA: I called and called but you were out. I thought I'd be gone before you got back.
ROB: Is that the last of it?
LAURA: Yep. I might have missed some stuff. I'm so used to some things being here that I don't even notice them.
ROB: Those look heavy. Where's Ian?
LAURA: He's at home. Listen, I can't believe he went to the store. I'm mortified, actually. I'm really sorry. He had no right to do that, and I told him so.
ROB: It was kind of funny.
LAURA: I'm sure.
ROB: You still together? Going all right?
LAURA: I don't really want to talk about it, to be honest.
ROB: That bad, eh?
LAURA: You know what I mean.
