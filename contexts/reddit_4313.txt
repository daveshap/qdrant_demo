The Flaws of Modern Dating
So here's my ***OPINION*** on the flaws of dating in our modern society.

***First off, let me start by prefacing that  I'm a single, hetrosexual  Korean American male, consider myself relatively attractive and relatively fit (whatever) but wanted to put this out there to begin with that so that you are aware of the perspective to which this originates from.***

&#x200B;

One of the biggest flaws in my opinion regarding dating in the modern age is that males overall are basically lost when it comes to understanding where they fall in today's societal role.  I'm often lost as to what if any role I play anymore in today's society?  Where do I fit in?  Does it fucking matter any more?  Whereas in the past, this was more defined (breadwinner, head of household, protector, etc) .

Now before you go crazy saying, "So the fuck what?  Do we have to have roles? blah blah"  This is not my point.  In fact, this is a whole other topic but rather what I'm saying is that when roles are less clear as they are today and completely blurred as they are today, it's hard to gauge in the dating world the roles we play as males in the dating world as well.

This ultimately has an effect because if the roles in the past were more defined, then the roles today should also adjust to the modern dating world as well.  In other words, if the notion of a male working and providing in families are no longer the norm, then males *making the* ***first move*** or ***paying for the first date*** and all of these antiquated roles, shouldn't they ***also*** be adjusted to the changing times?  Also, the notion of women being considered "sexually promiscuous" or called a "slut" due to simply desiring sex as much as men do, shouldn't that also be adjusted in today's society?  Aren't we way past the notion that having consensual sex is no longer a big deal at any stage of the dating timeline?  Why do we hold on to certain norms, yet not let go of others?  This is one of the major issues I have with modern dating.

Second, I believe that due to the age of dating apps and social media, we have been more molded to believe there are "types" or standards that must be preexist in order to even have a chance in any sort of engagement whatsoever.  I can not tell you how often I'm amused by Tinder profiles that state, *"If you're under 6ft tall, swipe left"*.  I'm left laughing out loud and amused thinking that this woman's height requirement will somehow magically spawn a connection with her Tinder date than a shorter guy because height requirements have everything to do with a real connection, right?  So with that said, I'm wondering if I were to put down, *"If you have anything less than  B Cup breasts, swipe left"*  is any more damaging or less offensive?

Of course there is nothing wrong with having standards,  but  the reality is that absolutely ***NO ONE*** falls into a ***perfect list*** or set of ***preexisting standards*** that will ever match ***BEFORE*** you even meet someone.  Thus, this endless swiping of lefts and endless non matching continues to pervade our society.

Have you noticed that on dating apps that allow you to pick categories or filter your matches in their search engine come up with less matches when you keep adding more filters?  So by that logic, if a dating app has trouble creating  matches due to preexisting qualifications, what does this say about the modern dating world?  And here we are left to wonder, why is it so fucking hard?

&#x200B;

The truth is, it really isn't hard.  I think if we let go of what we "want" because the truth is, what we want is irrelevant when it comes to a human being, because ***EVERYONE*** comes as a unique package full of  very specific and varied experiences and feelings and simply having an open mind of experiencing a person  and connecting with a person rather than checking off standards and "red flags"  would make the dating world so much easier.

Alas, we don't live there.  We are now in a world of disconnected and entitled people who are more image obsessed, instant obsessed, and status or financially  obsessed.  We live in a world full of unrealistic standards, and "don't waste my time", bots, fake profiles, cash money apps before replying, instagram click bait cam girls, ghosting as a normal way to communicate etc.  Thus, in my opinion, the existence of Tinder and how within *nanoseconds* we put our entire self worth in a swipe, is just damaging to our mental well being beyond repair.

Maybe I will never find my true happiness in a relationship, but that's ***TOTALLY*** ok with me.  Because I want to experience an organic relationship filled with all the ups and downs, including the tears and frustrations. But I want to live without the ***NEED*** of being with someone but rather the desire to experience life together with someone I want to be with and truly wants to be with me.  Because no one person is the answer to happiness.  I am the answer to my own happiness.

This reminds me of how often I used to go to parties and wonder why I wasn't having a good time?  Why when I arrived home after the party that  I was happiest?  After countless parties, I realized that the reason for this was that I was fully expecting the party to make me happy.  I would simply show up expecting all of these mental images to take place and end up disappointed and frustrated if this didn't play out by the end of the night.  ***How utterly ridiculous I had been.***  The party itself is ***only*** providing a venue and the ***opportunity*** for me to have a good time.  The real party exists within me.  ***I am responsible to create my own party and fun.***  Search high and wide and you will never find *"the ultimate fun venue"* that *"epic party"* you saw in that movie.  There will never ever be a *"fun"* venue.  ***I make it fun for myself.***  I can't tell you how many times the most fun I've ever had was telling jokes and laughing outside on a quiet porch at a house  party with a group of people I took the chance with to introduce myself to.  Or the countless times I went on amazing dates and had relationships with girls whom I found interesting and struck up a random conversation with no preexisting intentions or expectations at all.  10 out of 10 times this always happened when I honestly and genuinely only wanted to have a great time and great conversation, nothing more and nothing less.

In the same light, thinking that going on countless dates or even being in a relationship will result in my happiness is just as unhealthy and destructive because nobody wants to be with someone that expects this from them.  This is by definition unfair and unrealistic.  How can someone carry the weight of your happiness on their shoulders?  Absolutely no one should have to carry this responsibility.  Relationships, I believe flourish because both people can stand on their own.  ***Expecting the other person will fulfill anything in your life is just as bad as arriving to a party and expecting the party itself to make your evening fun***. That being said, I believe that "the one" does ***NOT*** exist but rather, a random connection that happens when two people randomly decide to make the effort and take the random  chance of wanting to give it a go and see what happens.  Failure is a huge part of this formula as everything is based on a random chance of things working and that's totally fine and ok.  And more likely than not, you will fail of course more often than succeed.  In the end, we have always been the gatekeepers of our own happiness in every situation of life.    And that I believe will never change.    Ok, I'm done.  Vent completed.  Thank you so much for listening and reading this rather long excerpt from my perspective.
