Got my very first AP scores!!
I took apush and ap Lang this year and I got 3s on both. I’m really proud of myself because despite not feeling prepared at all, I still pulled through! Plus I’m a slow writer so I only finished 2 of my essays for ap Lang, but I still got an awesome score! This is so crazy and I just wanted to share with you guys

Edit: just told my mom and she said she’s proud of me!! I’m really happy lol
