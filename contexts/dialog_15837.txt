ELLE: So, this is the only interaction you two have ever had?
PAULETTE: No. Sometimes I say Okay" instead of "Fine"."
ELLE: Have you ever considered asking him if he'd like a cold beverage? Or perhaps a neck massage?
PAULETTE: What's the point? Look at me.
ELLE: I am. And I'm looking at a beautiful, fabulous, sexy woman.
PAULETTE: Good one.
ELLE: Trust me. You've got the equipment, you just need to read the manual.
