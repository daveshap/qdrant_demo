ERIN: What kind of things come up?
ED: Things like the head counsel for PG&E calling me with an offer. 20 million, plus attorney's fees. Take it or leave it.
ERIN: Whoa. No shit.
ED: It's about 50 thousand per plaintiff.
ERIN: So what are you thinking?
ED: I'm thinking ... I wish someone else had to make this decision. 50 thousand bucks is more than any other California toxic plaintiff has gotten. Ever. But ...
ERIN: ... but it won't cover Annabelle Daniels's medical bills.
ED: And it's less than pocket change for PG&E.
ERIN: Do you think we'd do better by going to trial?
ED: Maybe. but maybe not. We still don't have anything linking this to PG&E corporate. Plus, there's the statute problem. Plus, we're way short on manpower, so we'd need to bring on more lawyers ...
ERIN: Plus, 40 percent of 20 million's a whole lot of money.
ED: It's eight million dollars, Erin. Eight million dollars.
