How do you figure out what to do with your life?
I don't mean to be super negative but it's already too late ðŸ˜‚

I'm 24. I have a dead end job that barely pays the bills.
I've been job searching for at least 6 months with no progress.
I have student loans out the ass.
I want to work for myself, but with loans and bills I need a steady income.
The one thing I'm passionate about I CANNOT pursue because I need a steady income.

What do I do? How do I figure out what I want to do with my life?
