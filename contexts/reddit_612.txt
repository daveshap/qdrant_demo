I don't know what to believe
There are people at my middle school who say their depressed, it's confusing. There so open about their "depression" but wouldn't someone depressed not want to talk about it? She tells me how she was depressed when she came overseas and when she was finally out of that state people actually thought she was depressed and harassed her back into depression again. I don't know, it seems far fetched, and then she says that she has voices in her head. I've heard from someone else she claimed to be molested in the U.S before coming overseas. But then how has no one found out about this? She never reported it? I can see it but then she says she doesn't trust therapists because one elegantly told her she was being overdramatic. I agree with the therapist on that one. And then she almost got me in trouble with another friend, she lied and said that I talked shit behind other friends back. So it may be that she just lies for attention/pity. And then she says she's bisexual at age 13, how do you know? You've never held hands with a girl let alone dated one. But I don't know, it all seems far fetched for some middle school girl to have all this shit. And its not just her, its like every girl says their depressed, bisexual, and have  a mental issue. And other than these claims and how annoying it gets to hear about the shit that's wrong with you and how you don't trust anyone but half the Fucking school to tell your depressed too, a lot are actually really nice people! I don't know, I need a 3rd opinion wise redditors.
