How can I make a specific root folder accessible for a user? I have installed Nextcloud via snaps, and it stores its files under /var/snap/nextcloud/common/nextcloud/data/FriedRose/files, owned by root. I like to give my normal user access to read and write to /var/snap/nextcloud/common/nextcloud/data/FriedRose/files/downloads.How can I achieve this without creating a security risk or breaking the snap package? Is giving all directories in this path the executable permission, and giving the downloads directors read and write permission, a good solution? (chmod a+x ...). If this is a good solution, then is there a way to automatically do it or should I write a little function to break up a path into all its directories?
