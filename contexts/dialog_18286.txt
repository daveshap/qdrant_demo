RITA: Hi Loretta.
LORETTA: Hi.
RAYMOND: Hi, Loretta.
LORETTA: Hi. Why ain't you at the store?
RITA: Is there anything you want to tell us, honey?
LORETTA: You? No.
RAYMOND: We just come from the bank.
LORETTA: The bank. OH MY GOD, I FORGOT TO MAKE THE DEPOSIT!
RITA: She's got it.
RAYMOND: I knew she had it.
RITA: We didn't know what to think. You were so weird yesterday, and then this morning, we go to the bank and no bag.
RAYMOND: WE NEVER SUSPECTED YOU!
