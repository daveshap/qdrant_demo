ANN: Stick a fork through me! I'm done. I'll never get this speech right.
MOTHER: Oh, yes you will, Ann dear . . . you're very clever.
ANN: Yeah, I know. What are you looking for?
MOTHER: Your purse. I need ten dollars.
ANN: What for? I gave you fifty just the other day.
MOTHER: Yes, I know, dear, but Mrs. Burke had her baby yesterday. Nine pounds! And there wasn't a thing in the house—and then this morning the Community Chest lady came around and—
ANN: And the fifty's all gone, huh? Who's the ten for?
MOTHER: The Websters.
ANN: The Websters!
MOTHER: You remember those lovely people your father used to take care of? I thought I'd buy them some groceries. Oh, Ann, dear, it's a shame, those poor—
ANN: You're marvelous, Ma. You're just like Father used to be. Do you realize a couple of weeks ago we didn't have enough to eat ourselves?
MOTHER: Well, yes, I know, dear, but these people are in such need and we have plenty now.
ANN: If you're thinking of that thousand dollars, forget it. It's practically gone. We owed everybody in town. Now, you've just gotta stop giving all your money away.
