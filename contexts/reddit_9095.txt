Quick warning to any single women looking to cut costs by getting a roommate.
Ask for women only.

I initially had my ad open for everyone because I didn't want to narrow the window too much. As long as you're a professional around my age and aren't a sleazeball, I didn't mind.

It only took about two days for the messages from thirsty men asking if I would be open to living with them rent free in exchange for sex. Which was always phrased as "help around the house/cleaning" or "companionship". I ignored most, but one guy called me directly.

Now someone did ask me if "a blowjob a week was really that bad in exchange for free rent". From a pragmatic standpoint, no. From a "personal morals, safety, and mental health" standpoint, YES.

Don't EVER feel like under the table prostitution is your only option. Do NOT let someone coerce you into doing it no matter how much you need the money. If sex work is something you want to do, that's perfectly fine. Just...don't start through these guys.

And even if it started out as a BJ a week, these guys will never stop asking for more. And no one needs their life controlled by the sexual whims of some dickhead who thinks he's entitled to your body in exchange for a roof over your head.

I'm sorry it got a bit ranty towards the end there, but that was a disgusting couple of days and I'm now working on getting a part time job instead of a roommate. Would rather have some extra expenses than have to deal with so many creeps.
