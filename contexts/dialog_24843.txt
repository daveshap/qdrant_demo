TAYLOR: Mac, what about the suit compartments on this level? Can they be accessed?
MAC: I'm sorry. The suit compartments are in a non-oxygenated, zero gravity atmosphere. I'm afraid that's off limits to all passengers.
TAYLOR: Damn it. If only we could get to those suits... Dawn then thinks of something -
DAWN: Why can't we?
TAYLOR: I don't know the condition of the compartments. Depending on damage, debris...could be a fatal mistake.
