People don't actually care
Isn't it funny to see how people always say things like "I'm here for you" and all that bullshit when you're gonna commit suicide? But when you're not committing suicide, they don't care. People leave you when you say you feel down, that you need somebody. Yet these same people are the ones that'll go "I care about you" when shit goes down.

People lie. Nobody cares about you. We're all worthless, like life itself.
