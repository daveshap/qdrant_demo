SCAGNETTI: What's the travelling arrangements?
WURLITZER: Well, Mickey and Mallory can't be together. So, we'll put you on one of our prison busses and you'll take Mallory first, then you'll come back for Mickey.
SCAGNETTI: And where do you keep Mickey?
WURLITZER: We got his stinkin' ass in the deepest, darkest cell in the whole place. But it just so happens that right now he's got a special visitor.
SCAGNETTI: Who?
WURLITZER: Wayne Gayle.
SCAGNETTI: Wayne Gayle!
