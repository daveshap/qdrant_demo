MARTHA: Why didn't you take her to a doctor?
MOTHER MIRIAM: It was healed by the following morning and she started eating again...
MARTHA: She had a... a hole in the palm of her hand! She could have bled to death.
MOTHER MIRIAM: But she didn't... did she. If anyone had seen what I'd seen she'd be public property... newspapermen, psychiatrists, ridicule. She doesn't deserve that.
MARTHA: She has it now.
MOTHER MIRIAM: I know what you're thinking, she's a hysteric pure and simple.
MARTHA: Not simple, no.
MOTHER MIRIAM: I saw it. Clean through the palm of her hand. Do you think hysteria could do that?
MARTHA: It's being doing it for centuries. She's not unique, she's just another victim.
MOTHER MIRIAM: God's victim. That's her innocence. She belongs to God.
MARTHA: And I intend to take her away from Him. That's what you're afraid of isn't it?
