Which salary estimation site should I trust/cite when determining salary requirements?
Hey internet! 

So I’m trying to figure out how much I should actually be getting paid. Surprise. I’ve been in my field nearly ten years and have had “superior performance” at every job — except probably my current one, but that’s a different story. 

Context: I’ve been interviewing with a few new companies and have gotten mixed reviews on salary range. I told one company (role reporting to CEO) my minimum was $60k and they said that was too much. For another job (reporting to VP), I told them $60k and the recruiter told me “I’m putting down $70k-$75k — that’s what you should be asking for.” They’re both in similar industries — the second one is arguably less responsibility, so what gives?

I’m interviewing with a third company that I really, really like so far, but salary hasn’t come up yet. This is another reporting to CEO job, same industry (SaaS dev). The recruiter already spilled the beans that she thinks I’m perfect, so I’m pretty confident I’ll make it to the next round. 

The problem: I have no clue what to ask for in terms of salary! The last two interviews have totally thrown me for a loop with their $20k difference. Doing salary research, it seems every single salary site puts me in the $55k-$60k range, but salary.com puts me at $80k-$88k. 

Which do I trust? Do I risk losing a possibly amazing opportunity (if offered) because I asked for too much? Or do I undersell myself and hope for another crazy recruiter to tell me “oh no, here’s an extra $15k”?

My location has had a surge in tech which has been increasing some salaries — I’ve seen recs for engineers offering Bay Area salaries. I know I’m worth more than the average person in my field — but I was (underpaid, admittedly) making $75k in the Bay Area last year and now that I’m in a lower COL, I’m just... confused. Help?
