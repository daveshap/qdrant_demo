How to "demonstrate knowledge" in a job application?
I am applying to environmental science/biology positions, and under the qualifications many of them list "demonstrated knowledge in xyz" (i.e. demonstrated knowledge of National Environmental Policy Act, Marine Mammal Protection Act, and Endangered Species Act). 

If I never took a class in the topics, such as environmental policy, how else would I demonstrate the knowledge? Most of these topics are things I could absolutely quickly learn on my own, but how would i demonstrate or prove that I do, indeed, have the knowledge?

Thanks!
