ROB: So. Where have you been staying for the last week?
LAURA: I think you know that.
ROB: Had to work it out for myself, though, didn't I?
LAURA: I'm sorry. I haven't been very fair to you. That's why I came here to the store this evening. I feel terrible, Rob. This is really hard, you know.
ROB: Good. So. Is it my job?
LAURA: What? Gimme a fucking break. Is that what you think? That your not big enough a deal for me? Jesus, gimme a little credit, Rob.
ROB: I don't know. It's one of the things I thought of.
LAURA: What were the others?
ROB: Just the obvious stuff.
LAURA: What's the obvious stuff?
ROB: I don't know.
LAURA: I guess it's not that obvious, then.
ROB: No.
