NICKY: Adrian, you gotta come back to Hell. Dad's sick.
ADRIAN: He's sick?
NICKY: Yeah, he needs souls to live. When you guys left, you broke the gates. We gotta get the gates burning again before he dies.
ADRIAN: He should have thought of that before he denied me my birthright.
NICKY: Well maybe you should go back and talk it over with him.
ADRIAN: How about this? I stay here enjoying my Schnapps and you go back.
