ROSE: Mr. Andrews, thank God! Where would the Master at Arms take someone under arrest?!
ANDREWS: What? You have to get to a boat right away!
ROSE: No! I'll do this with or without your help, sir. But without will take longer.
ANDREWS: Take the elevator to the very bottom, go left, down the crewman's passage, then make a right.
ROSE: Bottom, left, right. I have it.
ANDREWS: Hurry, Rose.
