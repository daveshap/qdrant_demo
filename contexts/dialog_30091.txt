LITTLE BILL: Hullo, Bob. Boys, this here is English Bob.
ENGLISH BOB: Shit and fried eggs.
LITTLE BILL: Been a long time, Bob. You run out of Chinamen?
ENGLISH BOB: Little Bill, I thought you were dead. I see you shaved off your chin whiskers.
LITTLE BILL: Well, I was always tasting the soup two hours after I et it.
ENGLISH BOB: What I heard was that you fell off your horse drunk and broke your neck.
LITTLE BILL: I heard that one myself, Bob. Hell, I even thought I was dead til I found out it was just I was in Nebraska. Who's your friend?
ENGLISH BOB: WW Beauchamp... Little Bill Daggett and... friends.""
