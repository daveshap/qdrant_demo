Student Affairs - Counselor Education or Higher Ed Administration
Hi all,

I am currently a master's candidate in Counseling Psychology with a concentration in student affairs administration. As I move further into my career as a student affairs professional, I am thinking about possibly moving up the ladder ( probably no more than a mid-level position like a Director's Position). Also know that I would like to consider teaching on the side in addition to being a practitioner, but not be a tenured faculty member. I would like to continue furthering education at some point but I could use some perspective and various paradigms.  I really love what I am am learning in my counseling courses and would want to build upon that so that I can teach others and build and implement those in which ever student affairs functional areas I could see myself in (mostly first-year expereince, college access & success, Academic Support and Recovery Services, career services and development, academic advising, admissions, pre-college programs). What are your opinions on pursuing a doctorate in counselor ed vs. higher ed administration? When I was looking at various curricula of programs, I was not fairly impressed; but I did find counselor education intriguing from the Ed.D level. NOTE: I have heard various times, "Focus on the present" , but this is not definite something that I am going to do; I would just like insight. Would you all have any suggestions  in terms of program focus? I feel that I can learn administration one the job but counseling is something I find very specialized that takes learning in a classroom setting and actual practice, but I would like to hear different voices. Thanks!
