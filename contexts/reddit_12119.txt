Every single night I cry before bed
I'm tired of being single, feeling unloved and empty. 

Never had a BF in my life and still a virgin at 23.

While all my ex-classmates from school and university are getting engaged/married, having children or are in stable relationships.

Why do they deserve the happiness I have been longing for years? I'm touched starved too.
