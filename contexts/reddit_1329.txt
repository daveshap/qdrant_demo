Does anyone else not go on Reddit after they post something because they're scared of what people will comment?
I do this a lot. Whenever I post something on Reddit I don't go on the site again for a while because I'm too scared to see what people commented on it. I'm super worried about what people will say about my post and I've deleted some of them because I was so apprehensive. I know I shouldn't be worried but I always end up worrying.
