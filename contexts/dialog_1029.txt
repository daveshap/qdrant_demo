MARGO: Here you are, Maxie dear. One good burp and you'll be rid of that Miss Caswell...
MAX: The situation I'm in ain't the kind you can belch your way out. I made a promise...
MARGO: Miss Caswell? What?
MAX: An audition for the part we're replacing. What's-her-name, your sister...
MARGO: Well, if she can act, she might not be bad. She looks like she might burn down a plantation...
MAX: I feel right now like there's one burning in me.
MARGO: When's the audition?
MAX: A couple of weeks.
MARGO: I tell you what. Why don't I read with her?
MAX: Would you?
MARGO: Anything to help you out, Max.
MAX: This is real cooperation. I appreciate it.
MARGO: Not at all. And you could do me a big favor, if you would-
MAX: All you got to do is name it.
MARGO: Give Eve Harrington job in you office.
MARGO: You get quick action, don't you?
MAX: Margo, I wouldn't think of taking that girl away from you...
MARGO: You said yourself my inventory was in good shape - all of my merchandise put away. To keep her here with nothing to do - I'd be standing in her way... and you need her, Max.
MAX: But what could she do?
MARGO: She'd be a great help - read scripts, interview people you have to see, get rid of the ones you don't have to... you'd be a man of leisure-
MAX: Well...
MARGO: Think of your health, Max - more time to relax out in the fresh air at a race track...
MAX: I don't know if this would be a wise move...
MARGO: Promise.
MAX: I promise.
MARGO: That's my Max.
LLOYD: There you are, both of you. Max, Karen has decided it's time to go.
MARGO: Where is she?
LLOYD: Up in the room.
