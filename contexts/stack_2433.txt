Using Carto.js with free account? I have a website running with an old CartoDB account and I would like to make some improvements.With the arrival of CARTO BUILDER, I lost the opportunity to share layers and thus be able to use carto.jsI understand when reading carto.js 4.0 that it is no longer possible to use it with a free account, since you need an API key to use it, but I am not sure.Can anyone confirm me this?
