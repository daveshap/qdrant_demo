I adopted a kitten and ive been bawling because i love him so much. I'm a proud cat dad
I cant tell if this is overdramatic or adorable, but I got this beautiful baby boy the other day, and hes just so sweet and wonderful. Lately at times I've felt a lack of empathy and alot of anxiety, but when I saw him I thought of how small he is and how I cant wait to be a dad. And I had a ton of anxiety regarding whether I set up his safe room well and if I would do something wrong and all that. All is going well so far, but just sitting here with him seeing how beautiful he is, and releazing how much I really do love him, I've just been crying my eyes out. Idk if this is weird or not. Regardless, I'm happy to welcome home my little Why Not. His names OllyðŸ’™
