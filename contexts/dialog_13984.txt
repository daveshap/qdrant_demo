MARYLIN: Hello?
MILES: Marylin?
MARYLIN: Miles? Miles! Where have you been? I've been trying to get in touch.
MILES: You have to leave the house immediately!
MARYLIN: I will, Miles. I will leave. But Miles --
MILES: No buts. Now. Out.
MARYLIN: Just listen to me. I'm sorry, Miles. It's true that my initial intention was to...
MILES: Please! Leave the house.
MARYLIN: I fell in love Miles.
MILES: So did I. Now pack up a few basics and --
MARYLIN: You do? You do love me?
MARYLIN: Whoever sent you, I'll pay double.
JOE: Mr. Dumbarton.
MARYLIN: Is this Mr. Dumbarton?
JOE: No...
JOE: That's his lawyer.
MARYLIN: Triple!
JOE: Who's the pigeon?
