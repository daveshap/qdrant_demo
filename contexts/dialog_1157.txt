MOZART: She's very tired, poor creature. You know me: I'm a real pig. It's not so easy cleaning up after me.
LEOPOLD: Don't you have a maid?
MOZART: Oh we could, if we wanted to, but Stanzi won't hear of it. She wants to do everything herself.
LEOPOLD: How is your financial situation?
MOZART: It couldn't be better.
LEOPOLD: That's not what I hear.
MOZART: What do you mean? It's wonderful. Really, it's - it's marvelous! People love me here.
LEOPOLD: They say you're in debt.
MOZART: Who? Who says that? Now that's a malicious lie!
LEOPOLD: How many pupils do you have?
MOZART: Pupils?
LEOPOLD: Yes.
MOZART: Yes.
LEOPOLD: How many?
MOZART: I don't know. It's not important. I mean, I don't want pupils. They get in the way. I've got to have time for composition.
LEOPOLD: Composition doesn't pay. You know that.
MOZART: This one will.
LEOPOLD: What's that?
MOZART: Oh, let's not talk about it.
LEOPOLD: Why not?
MOZART: It's a secret.
LEOPOLD: You don't have secrets from me.
MOZART: It's too dangerous, Papa. But they're going to love it. Ah, there she is!
MOZART: My Stanzi - look at her! Isn't she beautiful? Come on now, confess, Papa. Could you want a prettier girl for a daughter?
CONSTANZE: Stop it, Wolfi. I look dreadful. Welcome to our house, Herr Mozart.
MOZART: He's not Herr Mozart. Call him Papa.
LEOPOLD: I see that you're expecting.
CONSTANZE: Oh, yes.
LEOPOLD: When, may I ask?
CONSTANZE: In three months! Papa.
MOZART: Isn't that marvelous? We're delighted.
LEOPOLD: Why didn't you mention it in your letters?
MOZART: Didn't I? I thought I did. I'm sure I did.
CONSTANZE: May I offer you some tea, Herr Mozart?
MOZART: Tea? Who wants tea? Let's go out! This calls for a feast. You don't want tea, Papa. Let's go dancing. Papa loves parties, don't you?
CONSTANZE: Wolfi!
MOZART: What? How can you be so boring? Tea!
CONSTANZE: Wolfi, I think your father's tired. I'll cook us something here.
LEOPOLD: Thank you. That'll be fine. Don't spend any money on me.
MOZART: Why not? Oh, come, Papa! What better way could I spend it than on you? My kissable, missable, suddenly visible Papa!
