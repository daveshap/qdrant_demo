Self-signed certs on LAN shared with others My WiFi is shared with my family, and my siblings have friends come over sharing the WiFi password carelessly. Anyone of those guests could have a rogue device and not even know it.My brother has his own PC and I'm concerned about my brother's ability to keep his PC clean.I have servers running on my LAN and I use self-signed certs for them.Considering how many connected devices are on my LAN that I do not control, does this mean my self-signed certs are potentially useless and my secure comms are potentially useless?How can I solve this without needing FQDN and CA == (let's talk about fingerprinting)?I know the first step towards a solution would be VLANs to containerize non-trusted guest devices. However, there should be a way to have trust with a self-signed cert even when there are rogue devices in the network (enter fingerprinting). I really want to understand fingerprinting and how I can manually crosscheck keys to know if there is a MiTM.
