Why do people have to stigmatize rooming with a gay guy?

I (straight) decided to room with a gay guy because he seemed pretty cool. He told me that he has a boyfriend which made me figure out he’s gay (I had a little hint before tbh because of his pics) and it didn’t even matter to me and as soon as he knew I didn’t have any problems with it we mutually decided to room together. So I was facetiming my friends and told them about finding a roommate. So one of them just asked his name and started stalking his insta and figured out he’s gay and started making fun of me. Like how can you live with someone who is attracted to you? And like then they started making gay jokes on me. I was like ffs he’s just another guy and it’s 2020 I thought we were over this medieval mindset.
