Depression has completely ruined my life
I've had low self esteem since 13.

That low self esteem then evolved into depression and it has ruined my life...

I'm 30 years old, never had a date (let alone a girlfriend) or even a first kiss, no real job experience, $5K net worth, can't drive a car, obese, no social skills, I've lost all my friends and family because I isolated myself from them, and no matter how much self improvement I do, all I just is discover more problems about myself that need fixing.

The last time I ever felt happy in any way was during childhood. I can't believe how my family and friends never thought "hey, he used to be so happy as a kid and now he's a boring, overly silent adult who isolates himself at every family function, I think something is wrong with him".

My entire 20s, the time everybody regards as their best years, were spent drugging myself with video games, porn, and unemployment.

I've never put myself out there to meet a woman because I never felt good enough in any way, even when I was young. For 17 years I've felt nothing but loneliness and believed that I didn't deserve any love.

I read and see all these people in their 20s and 30s, all happy, surrounded by people who love them who are just as happy. All I think is "Why me? Why can't I be happy that like? What did I do to deserve this?"

Now at 30, I feel that by the time I fix myself, I will be too old to enjoy it and too old to have a family.
