What negative effects can Esuna cure? Final Fantasy 12 contains a lovely spell called Esuna(ga), which clears negative status effects from a character in your party. Memory serving, the original game's Esuna cleared almost everything; Blind, Poison, Sap, Doom, Oil, etc.This does not appear to be the case with The Zodiac Age. When going through the Stillshrine of Miriam, my entire party became afflicted with Oil, but Esuna would not clear it.Is Esuna tied to the licenses of \"Remedies remove more negative effects\or has its effectiveness been changed for TZA?
