ROB: -- FUCK OFF!
BARRY: We're only on the fucking list for Marie's gig at the Pulaski Pub, that's all! All three of us.
ROB: That's fucking great, Barry. We can spend fifteen bucks on a cab to save five each. Fantastic, Barry!
BARRY: We can take your car.
ROB: It's not my car, now is it? It's Laura's car, and thus Laura has it. So it's an ass-bumping double- transferring bus ride through bumblefuck or a fat wad on a cab. Wow. Fucking great.
