BEN: Sera... what you don't understand is...
SERA: What?
BEN: You can never... never... ask me to stop drinking. Do you understand?
SERA: I do. I really do. OK. I have to do some shopping alone. You go out for a few drinks and then pick up your things. Don't hurry and I'll be back before you to let you in.
