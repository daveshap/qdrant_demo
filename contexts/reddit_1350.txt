Does anyone else prefer single player games Over online multiplayer games?
Single player games seem peaceful and relaxing, like everything is going well and you're actually fun. Online multiplayer seems so stressful, frightening, and it really makes you think a lot of negative things.

It feels discouraging that some people I know think it's weird for me to play only single player games.

Edit: I didn't expect this post to get so many responses. It really helps to know that there were so many different answers and seeing different perspectives on this. Thanks :D
