BOND: Sidney Winch, meet -
WADE: Jack Wade. Citibank. Commercial loan division. If you're ever lookin' for a sweet refinance on the boat -
SIDNEY: - Shut up!
BOND: You have to excuse Miss Winch: She thinks she's on a 'seduce and destroy' mission through life... ...But she won't kill us.
SIDNEY: No?
BOND: No. First, because I don't think it's in your nature. And second, because there's no gold down there.
SIDNEY: So charming! So suave! Don't insult me. I'm not one of your 'little London girls' who falls for the lies.
