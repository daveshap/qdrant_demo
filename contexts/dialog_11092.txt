MICHAEL: You've grown so tall... so tall in the last year. You're much taller than me.
ANTHONY: I was taller than you when I was fourteen.
MICHAEL: Sit down. Your Aunt Connie and I waited for you to have some lunch, but now it's all dried out.
ANTHONY: I'm not hungry.
MICHAEL: Well, that's alright... alright. Good. You'll graduate in another year, isn't that right? You know... I never finished college. I was a good student, but I never finished. Of course, there was a war then.
