Ever wonder how so many people haven’t killed themselves?
It boggles my mind that there are so many people that exist on earth and just,,, live. They rlly be out here alive. Like if they feel how I feel , how the fuck haven’t they killed themselves yet? Am I just weak? Am I weak for thinking about suicide? All the time? I just can’t fathom the idea that people can live life and see a reason to go on every day. I google searched “why don’t people kill themselves” and the only hits I got were links related to “why do people kill themselves?”  But that answer is so fucking obvious to me. I need to know why they DONT kill themselves.
