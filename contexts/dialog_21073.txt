ANNE: I've got a present. Shut your eyes. Keep 'em closed. I know you're going to love them.
STEW: Little - couldn't be an automobile, could it? Well, well! Ain't that nice!
ANNE: Do you like them?
STEW: Got my initials on them too. They're cute. They're nice little things - what do you do with them?
ANNE: You wear them of course, silly.
STEW: Oh no. No, no. Not me. I haven't worn these things for Years.
ANNE: I know that.
STEW: Besides I'd look foolish. I couldn't look Gallagher in the face.
ANNE: Darling, I don't care whether you can look Gallagher in the face or not, but you're gonna be a good boy and wear garters.
STEW: Honey, I love you. I'll eat spinach for you. I'll go to the dentist twice a year for you. I'll wash behind my ears for you. But I will never wear garters!
ANNE: Oh, yes you will my dear - oh, yes you will my dear - you'll wear garters and you'll like it too!
STEW: Oh, no I won't my dear - oh, no I won't my dear - I'll wash behind my ears, but no I won't my dear!
ANNE: Oh, yes you will my dear - oh, yes you will my dear - you'll eat spinach but you'll wear garters too!
STEW: Oh, you can't carry a tune - you can't carry a tune - all you are good for is to sit and spoon, spoon. Oh no, I won't wear garters—
ANNE: Oh yes you will wear garters—
