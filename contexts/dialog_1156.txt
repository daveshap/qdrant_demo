MOZART: Feed? Well, of course she feeds me. She stuffs me like a goose all day long. She's the best cook in the world. I mean, since Mama. Just wait, you'll see.
LEOPOLD: Is she not here?
MOZART: I don't know. Stanzi? Stanzi!
LEOPOLD: Do you always live like this?
MOZART: Oh, yes. Oh, I mean no - not exactly like this. I mean today - just today, Stanzi - I remember now. She had to go - yes! She had to help her mother. Yes, she's like that. Her mother's a very sweet woman, you'll see.
