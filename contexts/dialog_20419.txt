GLENN: I mean I'm not stealing the fucking car.
KAREN: You're not?
GLENN: I already stole it. Last week or whenever it was, in West Palm. I can't be stealing it again, can I?
KAREN: The two guys you were with -- that one, that isn't Maurice Miller, is it? I've seen Snoopy's mug shot and that didn't look like him.
GLENN: Jesus. How'd you know about Snoopy?
KAREN: Glenn, I know your life history, who your friends are, where you've been and now, it looks like, where you're going. Put your hands on the wheel.
GLENN: You're gonna bust me for picking up a car?
KAREN: For the car, for aiding and abetting a prison escape, and conspiring to do whatever you came here for.
GLENN: Listen, these guys, they're gonna be out here any minute looking for me. They're fucking animals.
KAREN: What's going on, Glenn?
GLENN: Nothing. I just wanna get the fuck outta here.
KAREN: But I thought the whole thing was your idea?
GLENN: Rippin' off Ripley was my idea, but these guys, man, they're into shit I can't handle.
KAREN: Ripley? You mean the wall street guy?
GLENN: Yeah, the plan was to pick him up at his office tomorrow, take him out to his house in Bloomfield Hills. Now, I don't give a shit what they do.
KAREN: And is Foley a part of this?
GLENN: He's supposed to be, but he hasn't shown up yet, which is a good thing for him.
KAREN: Why's that?
GLENN: Maurice is gonna kill him, try and collect the reward.
KAREN: But you say he hasn't shown up, you think he backed out?
GLENN: I don't know-- he doesn't exactly confide in me.
KAREN: Gee, I wonder why not.
GLENN: I'm freezing my ass off.
KAREN: You want to get out of here, run, it'll warm you up.
GLENN: Really?
KAREN: But listen, Glenn. If you're lying to me...
GLENN: I know, you'll find me. Jesus, I believe it. I keep thinking if you hadn't driven me to federal court last summer, you wouldn't even know who I am.
KAREN: If I didn't know you, Glenn, by tomorrow you'd be in jail or dead. Look at it that way. Go on.
