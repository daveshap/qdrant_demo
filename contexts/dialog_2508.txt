JENNIFER: Hi.
BRIAN: Hi.
JENNIFER: We still talking? Look, I'm sorry about the other day --
BRIAN: Swayzak knows something about the guys that were murdered. I want to know why he keeps that hidden.
JENNIFER: I don't know anything about it.
BRIAN: You could check. It'd be in his files.
JENNIFER: Do you know what you're asking me to do?
BRIAN: Yes.
JENNIFER: Y'know, four years ago I was working in a bakery. Two years ago I was bringing Marty coffee and he didn't even know my name. I run that office now. Marty believed in me and I believe in him. You want me to just throw that away?
BRIAN: Your boss is lying, Jennifer.
