Help Approaching Boss for Development
I need some help with figuring out the next move at my company. 

I've been at my current company for about 2.5 years.  When I was first hired on, it was so I could help the then project manager expand this new business line.  Long story short, that manager ended up being very hands off, and I ended up being responsible for leading the team, handling meetings with client, facilitating the manager's meetings, and doing the actual technical work.  The PM was fired and replaced, team shuffled, and throughout all of this, the company owner made it a point to tell me how he appreciated what I was doing, and that he saw me evolving into a partner at the company.   

Around this time last year I had to move departments to fill in a vacant position, and everything shifted at this point.  I got little to no interaction with the company owner or other managers, and when we did interact the dynamic changed.  Managers now talk to me like I'm an entry level employee without the benefit of anyone checking in on my status or progress.  I've tried to be patient over the last year and learn more in my new position, but nothing seems to be changing and I'm starting to feel like I'm needed to fill this role, but I'm not a valued member of the team anymore.  

The actual request - I'm going to approach the boss in the next few weeks to discuss what opportunities there are for me in the company, and/or what he thinks I need to work on to get to the "next level."   What feedback do you all have on how to approach this conversation?  I don't want it to come across as I'm complaining for being a forgotten employee, but I do want to get the message across that if no one checks in on me while still treating me like a younger employee, then I have no tools to succeed and/or progress.
