STEPHEN GELLER: This had nothing to do with shoes that didn't fit or my relationship with my father who, as you know, made a fortune selling penny loafers in the fifties. These people died because of the criminal actions of my doctor.
ROBERT HAWKINS: Your doctor?
STEPHEN GELLER: Yes. My psychiatrist didn't insist that I stay on my medication.
ROBERT HAWKINS: ...so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people?
STEPHEN GELLER: It was my finger that pulled the trigger, but I'm not morally responsible. My psychiatrist knew what I was capable of. How could I know. I'm not a doctor.
ROBERT HAWKINS: You seem very savvy for a man who's been found mentally incompetent to stand trial.
STEPHEN GELLER: Look, I'm a victim here, too. I was a year away from getting my masters in Art, now I'll never graduate. My life has been permanently disrupted.
ROBERT HAWKINS: Permanently disrupted? Aren't you selling paintings now for quite a lot of money? Hasn't this 'incident' as you call it, jump started your career as an artist?
STEPHEN GELLER: Look, I'm in here. You call this a career move?
ROBERT HAWKINS: And isn't there a movie in the works about you?
STEPHEN GELLER: We're in negotiations, that's correct.
ROBERT HAWKINS: But doesn't the Son of Sam Law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes?
STEPHEN GELLER: That doesn't apply to me because I'm not a criminal. I'm not a criminal! I wasn't convicted.
