Anyone else feel like conversation is just a set of rules and ur always carefully following them and ur constantly trying to not be awkward or weird or talk too much about yourself?
I dont know if its normal to be like this, sometimes I feel like maybe I have undiagnosed ADHD, but other times I think its just all the anxiety and depression from being a college drop out and being gay and trans. Like am I really this stupid and spacey or did I make myself stupider as a defense mechanism since I didn't have a reason to suddenly be so shit at school?
