Current sense amplifier for high voltage (100-150V) low current (20 mA) application I have an application where I need to measure the current on a relatively high voltage rail. The problem is that the current on the rail is quite low, only about 20 mA. Because of the high voltage, high side sensing isn't an option. Has anybody got any experience with low side current sensing in high voltage, low current applications? Which current sense amp would you suggest/how would one go about this? Thanks,Peter
