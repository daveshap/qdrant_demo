JENNIFER: So, what'd you say to that fuckin' jerk anyway?
GINGER: I told him I was Mrs Sam Rothstein.
JENNIFER: Well, you might as well get somethin' out of it.
ACE: Well, it wasn't long before what I was afraid was gonna happen, happened. Nicky managed to get himself banned from every casino in Las Vegas, and from then on, I couldn't be seen talkin' to him anywhere in Vegas, or even near it.
NICKY: What the fuck is that supposed to mean?
NICKY: ' ...detrimental to gaming. And he will be ejected from any casino in Las Vegas... and the casinos can be fined as much as a hundred thousand every time he shows up.' Do you believe this shit?
ACE: Yeah, I believe it. You got banned.
