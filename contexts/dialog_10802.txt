DANA: What do you think?
VENKMAN: There's no doubt about it. He's got his father's looks. The kid is ugly -- extremely ugly. And smelly. You stink! It's just horrible. You are the stinkiest baby I ever smelled. What's his name?
DANA: His name is Oscar.
VENKMAN: Oscar! You poor kid!
DANA: Peter, this is serious. I need to know if you think there's anything unusual about him.
VENKMAN: Unusual? I don't know. I haven't had a lot of experience with babies.
DANA: I'll do it.
VENKMAN: I'll supervise.
VENKMAN: Well, Holmes, what do you think?
STANTZ: It's an interesting one, Pete. If anything was going on it's totally subdued now.
VENKMAN: What now, Brainiac?
SPENGLER: I think we should see if we can find anything abnormal on the street.
VENKMAN: Finding something abnormal on the street shouldn't be too hard.
VENKMAN: Brings back a lot of sweet memories, doesn't it? There's our old cash machine. And the dry cleaners we used to go to. And the old video store. We really had some good times, didn't we?
DANA: We definitely had a moment or two.
DANA: That's where the buggy stopped.
VENKMAN: Okay, let's take a look.
STANTZ: Is this the spot?
DANA: A little to the left. Right there! That's where it stopped.
STANTZ: Nothing. Not a trace.
SPENGLER: Why don't we try the Giga-meter?
VENKMAN: What's that?
STANTZ: Egon and I have been working on a gauge to measure psychomagnetheric energy in GEVs - giga electron volts.
SPENGLER: That's a thousand million electron volts.
VENKMAN: I knew that.
STANTZ: I think we hit the honeypot, boys. There's something brewing under the street.
DANA: Peter, do you think maybe I have some genetic problem or something that makes me vulnerable to these supernatural things.
