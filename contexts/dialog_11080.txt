SENATOR KANE: Mr. Corleone, do you have any hotel interests in the state of Arizona? Or any gambling interests in that state?
MICHAEL: I do not.
SENATOR KANE: Do you have interests or control over gambling and narcotics in the state of New York.
MICHAEL: I do not.
HAGEN: Senator, my client would like to read a statement for the record.
SENATOR KANE: I don't think that's necessary.
HAGEN: Sir, my client has answered every question asked by this committee with the utmost cooperation and sincerity. He has not taken that Fifth Amendment as it was his right to do, and which because of the extreme legal complexity of this hearing, counsel advised him to do. So, I think in all fairness this committee should hear his statement and put it in the record.
SENATOR KANE: Very well.
