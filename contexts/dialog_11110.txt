CLAY: It's your job, lady, not mine. I'm here so he can draw my picture.
HANNA: I'm keeping away. What you are doing is no business of mine.
CLAY: What're you talking about?
HANNA: What kind of man are you? Are you a good man?
CLAY: Yeah, I'm a good man. Something make you think I'm not?
HANNA: You will not hurt him?
CLAY: Gimme a break. I'm going to sit on my ass while he draws pictures. Is that going to hurt him?
HANNA: No. No. I am sorry. Forget everything I say. Here. I will take the tray.
CLAY: You do that.
