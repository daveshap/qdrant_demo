I’ve seen child porn on the internet. I will never be the same again.
I saw it on twitter. Multiple accounts. I cybertipped them all. There were so many videos. After a while I lost my head and I had to stop. I couldn’t report anymore accounts. I didn’t want to look at them. In the process of reporting one of the videos I thought I accidentally lost the link and freaked out at the thought of having to go back to copy the link again. I will never be the same. There is true evil in this world. I don’t trust men or women anymore. Everyone is a monster. There were so many women in these videos. So many. For a long time afterwards I was paranoid I was a pedophile, a freak, a creep for having seen them, although I am a bisexual woman who has only ever been with people my age or older. I feel just as bad for having seen it. I feel immense guilt for tapping out and not reporting every single account. I just could not watch that shit anymore.
