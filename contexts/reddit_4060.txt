How can I keep a chat alive if she only says "ahahah" "yeah" and things like this?
This girl started the conversation but after a while she starts to write empty messages that do not offer "handholds" to continue talking. On these occasions sometimes i send her some memes to have some interaction but when she keeps laughing i don't know what to do. It's not on tinder and we already had a date went good but we live a bit far and then she want to talk.
What can i do?
