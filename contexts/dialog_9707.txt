BOBBY: Well...
PALM: It's just filthy. People are dirty. I think that's the biggest thing that's wrong with people. I think they wouldn't be as violent if they were clean, because then they wouldn't have anybody to pick on... Oofh... Dirt...
RAYETTE: Well...
PALM: Not dirt. See, dirt isn't bad. It's filth. Filth is bad. That's what starts maggots and riots...
PALM: Hey, follow that truck. They know the best places to stop.
RAYETTE: That's an old maid's tale.
PALM: Bullshit! Truck drivers know the best eating places on the road.
RAYETTE: Salesmen and cops are the ones. If you'd ever waitressed, honey, you'd know.
PALM: Don't call me honey
RAYETTE: Don't call me mack
PALM: I wouldn't be a waitress. They're nasty and full of crap.
RAYETTE: You better hold onto your tongue!
PALM: Hold onto this.
RAYETTE: Just one minute, you! Don't you ever talk to me like that!
BOBBY: Shut up! All of you!
