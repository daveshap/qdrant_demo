ANDY: Great. Later on we'll have to get together for cocktails. Right now I kinda have to hurry before I grow a lot of hair and eat people. Say this heart thing works. What's it got to do with ADM?
CLAUDE: It's chemistry, Andy. Nothing more. Mutated antigens concentrated in the heart of the infector unlock a vaccine- like chain reaction in the infectee. There were not many bio-chemists working in the twelfth century, but with today's technology it's possible to synthesize any chemical imaginable. When I discovered this ancient cure I knew who to go to.
ANDY: Uncle Terrence.
CLAUDE: Yes. I was able to decode the old texts and give Terrence the specifications. It took a lot of trial and error, but finally he got it: Adenine Di-Methyloxide. ADM. I call it ADAM. But just before he was attacked, he hid it...
ANDY: Because Gaston was after it.
CLAUDE: Yes, that sociopath. He's given himself over to the evil of lycanthropy. To him, ADAM is just a threat to the terror he holds over others. To us, it's salvation.
MARCEL: Yeah, well I don't know much about chemistry, but even if this stuff works, you better find it by midnight. Otherwise it's -
ANDY: Yeah, I know. Back to the Eiffel Tower. And what about you?
