My mom keeps posting obnoxious Boston oriented things on Facebook...
She grew up in Medford, which is Boston adjacent but not part of Boston. She never lived in Boston, and she moved away from being Boston adjacent over 30 years ago

But she always posts these bullshit forwards from grandma type things "YOU KNOW YOU'RE A BOSTON GIRL WHEN YOU DON'T TAKE SHIT" and et cetera.

LADY. YOU'RE NOT A BOSTON ANYTHING. YOU'RE NOT FROM BOSTON. GOD **DAMNIT**
