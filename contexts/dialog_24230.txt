KATRINA: I have been reading your journal. I'm sorry. I found it too fascinating to resist. I rode to catch up with you at the Notary, out of curiosity. Before I found you though, I overheard what you were said.
ICHABOD: It was you there?
KATRINA: When... when you spoke father's name along with accusations, I could not believe it. I had to hide these... at least till I could confront him myself.
ICHABOD: And, what did he say?
KATRINA: He did not do these things. If you knew him, you would realize...
ICHABOD: What did he say, Katrina?
KATRINA: I have not been able to face him yet.
ICHABOD: The loans give the land to your father. It does not matter survivors are still on their farms. They could be thrown off... tomorrow... a year from now.
KATRINA: Yes, I have seen that, and I told you why I hid them.
ICHABOD: What would you have me believe?
KATRINA: If you think I am behind this, say it.
ICHABOD: The name Van Tassel is blackened. You share that name.
KATRINA: Call me a liar, then, and a murderess. Say it, out and out.
ICHABOD: Katrina...
KATRINA: Speak the words, Constable. What is stopping you? What has happened to your ability to transcend sentimentality?
