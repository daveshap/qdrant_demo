startup disk creator dose not make bootable usb in Ubuntu 18.04 I have use the start up disc creator in Ubuntu 18.04 to make a bootable USB to install an OS on a pc. Unfortunatly when I plug in the drive the PC will not boot from the drive. I have tried 3 different OS's including Ubuntu 16, 18, and Mint 19 and none of them will boot properly. I tried 4 different USB drive and still having problems with drives not booting. Am I doing something wrong or is there a problem with the startup disk creator? I appriciate any assistance. :)
