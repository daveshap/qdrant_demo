RASCZAK: We must be right over the colony. Let's get some air support, eh ?
GILLESPIE: Yes, sir ! Fleet, this is Roughneck patrol, over ...?
RASCZAK: Corporal, I want pulse cannons there and there ! Rifle teams, spread out along the ridge ! Sugar, bring up that flame thrower !

RASCZAK: They'd rather spend our lives than risk their ships. Who's got the nuke ?
