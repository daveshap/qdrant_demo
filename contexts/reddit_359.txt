She told her friend she just wants to be friends but sends all signs she’s interested



So I liked this girl for like a year (still do) I told her I liked her when I was drunk like 4 months ago. That’s when we started talking a little bit more. But we still had practically no contact apart from the occasional look from across the classroom. But a month ago we went to a party. I was drunk she wasn’t she doesn’t really like it when I drink but when I stared getting less and less drunk we just relaxed on the bed for 2 hours with her head on my shoulder the entire time. That’s when we started texting and sending pictures and such. But the day after she told my friend she just wanted to be friends. Which I found out today. But that’s the confusing part she always asks the teacher if I can sit with her in math class. We get a private room because we both blow ass in math. In the the break we sit on a couch and she is always all over me. With her legs over mine we also hold each other’s hands a little awkwardly for example she takes my hand says “wow your hands are much bigger than mine” than just holds my hand for a few minutes. She asked me if I just liked her or “loved” her I said I loved her (love in my language is basically the best translation but it isn’t that big of a deal as it is in other places like America) then she sent this string of emojis 😊🤭❤️. We always talk about having a movie marathon together. She is usually the one that brings it up. I always say she can come whenever she wants. She says she will come over when she comes home from her vacation. So that’s pretty nice. But we had a small argument about a week ago about my snusing habits which is basically a small package of nicotine you put in your lip. It is basically the same as smokes but with out the lung cancer and the awful smell. She said if I ever did it she would never be my friend again. Of course my friends told me to tell her because she would find out eventually so I told her. She said we could still be friends and that she was joking. But she was mad at me so I told her I’ll give her space. Which she didn’t want but I said I didn’t wanna talk if your just gonna send pictures of your roof that’s when she said OKAY I AM NOT MAD AT YOU. Which practically reverted everything to normal. And we started talking 24/7 again. So do you guys think she likes me or just playing with me?

she has never been in any serious relationship. Neither have I

she told me about a dream where she kissed a stranger once. She sort of inclined it was me

she has never kissed anyone. She did watch a Netflix movie where someone kissed and said omg so cute their kissing then I asked who. Then she said “you and me😉😉😉» 

I left her on read once so she started started spamming the “all I want” song from Olivia Rodriguez and stated it was literally her love life on private snap story. Which is like a half sad love song

We’re both 15. I am male she’s female 

Tl;dr. Told girl I liked her while drunk. Girl tells friends she only wants to be friends but she send all signs she likes me. Texting, constant looks, really touchy, had her head on my shoulder for 2 hours straight, constantly talks about wanting to have a movie marathon
