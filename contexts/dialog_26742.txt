MIKE: Thanks.
BLONDE: I've seen you somewhere... Where have I seen you?
MIKE: You ever go to the Kelbo's? On Pico?
BLONDE: ...maybe...
MIKE: ...Monday nights? I host an open mike...
BLONDE: You're a comedian?
MIKE: Yeah.
BLONDE: What's that like?
MIKE: Well, you know, it's tough. A lot of traveling. A lot of hotels... but, you know, it's a dream... and the money's really good. I think I might buy another really expensive imported car after my next gig in Vegas...
BLONDE: I know! Starbucks! I served you an espresso at Starbucks.
MIKE: Are you sure? Maybe...
BLONDE: Yes! Remember? You asked me for an application? I introduced you to the manager?
MIKE: Oh, yeah... Boy, that must've been a while ago.
BLONDE: I'd say about two weeks.
MIKE: Probably a little longer than that, but, whatever.
BLONDE: You better pay the man.
