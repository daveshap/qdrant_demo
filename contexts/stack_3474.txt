Creating portable bash terminal & cmd to USB Developing my toolkit and I want to have a safe edition of cmd.exe and bash on a usb. Why? These can be tampered with by attackers and I want a version I know is safe from manipulation. Any suggestions? Is this even possible today? I've read old stories about it. I've considered cygwin but it's only executable from Windows (currently don't have access to Windows) but unable to find any other possibilities. Is this not possible since it's tied locally? Thank you!edit: changed \"bootable\" to \"portable\" to lessen confusion.
