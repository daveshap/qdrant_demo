JANET: I'm engaged to Brad just the same as Betty Monroe was to Ralph Hapschatt. But Frank's kisses overwhelmed me with an ecstacy I've never dreamt of before. Hot, burning kisses.
BRAD: And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to turn to stone The sweeter the wine The harder to make the break You hear something about someone You'd thought you'd known.
JANET: I could see Brad's face before me and my mind screamed No! But my lips were hungry - too hungry.
BRAD: So baby don't cry like there's no tomorrow After the night there's a brand new day. And there'll be no pain And no more sorrow. So wash your face And phone my place It'll be O.K.
JANET: I wanted to be loved completely. My body throbbed excitedly. Oh Brad, Brad my darling, how could I have done this to you?
BRAD: And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to beat again. So give me a sign That a lover makes You look around The one you've found Is back again.
JANET: If only we hadn't made this journey. If only the car hadn't broken down. If only we were amongst friends or sane persons.
