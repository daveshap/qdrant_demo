Curious about a recruiter's response
Hi, so I applied for a job and honestly I just did it because 'why not?' I think I would love working for this company but I wouldn't think they would hire me since I don't have much experience yet.

The thing is mainly just curiousity since I just want to know what should I think of their response, they said this to me in an email:

>'Dear (my  name),  
>  
>Thank you very much for your application and interest in working with  us here at (company name). While our team appreciated your application for the position of (position) and has  reviewed it carefully, we have decided to move forward with another candidate at this time.  
>  
>While we didn’t select your application this time, we are very  interested by your profile and may reach out to you regarding future opportunities.    
>  
>In the meantime, please visit regularly the Careers website for new postings and to keep your profile up to date. Also, you could consider following our new career Twitter account for the latest openings.   
>  
>Thanks again for your time and your interest in us,  
>  
>The Recruitment Team'

I honestly don't mind and understand their decision, I will keep working hard to try to improve, I'm just curious to know the opinion of people who know more about this, when the recruitment says this kind of things, do they mean what they said in this email and are truly interested in the profile or it's just sugar-coating a 'We don't truly want you'.
