Historiography... I'm kind of confused.
Hey, All History Grad students.   
I'm a grad student; I have an assignment I'm not clear on. The prompt is to take a significant event from a year my parents or grandparents were born. Then, explain the events using the same source material, from three different historiographical approaches.   
In class, we discussed Ranke, Foucault, E.P. Thompson, Hume, Marx, and The Annales School. Yet, I'm still kind of stuck. As for the event I'm using, it is when John Glenn orbited the earth in 1962.  I wanted to use Foucault, Thompson, and Ranke. But I'm having some difficulty understanding their work. Thanks in Advance
