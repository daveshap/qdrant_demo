DOYLE: You didn't see the killing, or the body? How do you know there was a murder?
JEFF: Because everything that man's done has been suspicious. Trips at night in the rain, saws, knives, trunks with rope, and a wife that isn't there any more.
DOYLE: I'll admit it all has a mysterious sound -- but is could mean a number of different things. Murder is the least likely.
JEFF: Go ahead, Doyle -- tell me he's an unemployed magician -- amusing the neighborhood with sleight-of-hand.
DOYLE: It's too stupid and obvious a way to murder -- in full view of fifty windows -- and then sit over there -- -- smoking a cigar -- waiting for the police to pick him up.
JEFF: Well, officer -- do your duty.
DOYLE: You've got a lot to lean about homicide, Jeff. Morons have committed murder so shrewdly that it took a hundred trained police minds to catch them. That salesman wouldn't just knock off his wife after dinner, toss her in a trunk and put her in storage.
JEFF: I'll bet it's been done.
DOYLE: Almost everything's been done -- under panic. But this is a thousand to one shot. That man's still sitting around his apartment; he isn't panicked.
JEFF: You think I made all this up?
DOYLE: I think you saw something -- that probably has a very simple explanation.
JEFF: For instance?
DOYLE: His wife took a trip.
JEFF: She -- was -- an -- invalid!
DOYLE: You told me. I've got to run, Jeff.
JEFF: All right -- you don't believe me.
DOYLE: I -- uh -- won't report it to the Department. Let me poke into a little on my own. No point in you getting any ridiculous publicity.
JEFF: Thanks.
DOYLE: We know the wife is gone. I'll see if I can find out where.
JEFF: Do that.
