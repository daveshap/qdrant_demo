PSA: Women, PLEASE pay your guys compliments if you're dating them. I was led on by this one girl for 5 months who never complimented me and it made me feel like absolute SHIT
**EDIT:** I shouldn't have to be saying this because it is already in the post, but I had **asked her out on several occasions** and she came up with another bullshit excuse each time. Not to mention that **she even asked me to drive to her place on several occasions** and then refused to give me her address.

*Yes, Reddit... I know I should have spotted the signs earlier and that she likely was using me for attention. But that's besides the point.*

In early December 2018, I matched with this one really cute girl. She was a bigger girl with short, black hair. Our conversations quickly moved over to Snapchat. We immediately developed great chemistry: We shared a lot of common life interests, personality traits, and even sexual fetishes.

We would often sext each other. She would frequently post sexy selfies on SC where she would show a lot of skin, and this would sometimes lead us to sexting when I complimented her. I would also sometimes send her snaps in order to get her attention.

Anyway, 5 months passed and she never met up with me. I was played like a fool; every time she came up with an excuse "I'm PMSing", "I'm sick", "I have a party to go to", "I got called into work", etc. and even when she asked me to come see her, she never gave me her address. So I ended things. But I noticed one really hollow and unfulfilling aspect of this.

I never got any compliments. Not a single one on how I looked. She never complimented my hair, face, eyes, body, member, no, NOTHING. I got *ONE* compliment telling me how she loves a "thick daddy" (I'm 6'2" and 201 pounds so just a tiny bit chubby, not overweight). I would always compliment her on how sexy her stomach/boobs/ass/thighs/etc. looked, and she loved it and ate it all up. But I NEVER got any compliments beyond "cutie" or "sexy". Nothing *specific* as to how I looked.

I know that I'm not ugly. My physical appearance is something that I'm quite confident about, and I have been described as having "no bad features". But good lord, I cannot even begin to describe how un-sexy this whole "relationship" made me feel.

Women, if you like a guy, PLEASE give them compliments on their physical appearance - and ones that are very specific as to how they look. It really goes a long way.
