GRANDFATHER: The Eel doesn't get her. I'm explaining to you because you looked nervous.
THE KID: Well, I wasn't nervous.
THE KID: Well, maybe I was a little bit concerned. But that's not the same thing.
GRANDFATHER: Because I can stop now if you want.
THE KID: No. You could read a little bit more ... if you want. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 17.
