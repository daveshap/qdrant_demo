Does anyone else get overwhelmed with sudden plans and shut down?
If I get invited to something day-of I’ve been freaking out recently. I’m not really sure if it’s depression or anxiety. But it’s like I really want to go but the possibilities overwhelm me. I have 100% of these times ended up at home alone and crying because I really don’t want to be. I don’t know if I should force myself to go or what. I usually end up frustrating (as far as my itchy mind can tell) my live-in boyfriend because I have to do mental gymnastics about it for a hour or two, make him late, then end up not going.  I don’t think he’s mad or cares but I feel bad about it still, Help?
