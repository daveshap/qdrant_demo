AMADO: If you had your way I wouldn't have any friends.
PILAR: Oh, come on, Amado--
AMADO: Just 'cause I'm not like Little Miss Honor Roll here--
PILAR: Leave your sister out of it.
AMADO: You and all of the teachers in this dump--your story's over, so you don't want anybody else to have fun.
PALOMA: You jerk--
AMADO: I'm not talking to you. You don't have any friends.
PALOMA: Who'd want to be friends with that bunch of pachuco wannabes?
AMADO: I don't pretend I came over on the Mayflower--
PALOMA: And those stupid girls who hang out with them--
AMADO: Just shut up.
PALOMA: Joanie Orozco's telling the whole school she's like desperately in love with Santo Guerra.
AMADO: So?
PALOMA: It's pathetic. You can't be desperately in love when you're 14 years old.
PALOMA: Not if you have half a brain in your head.
PILAR: Of course you can.
PALOMA: What?
PILAR: It doesn't have anything to do with being smart.
