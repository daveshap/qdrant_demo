I've stopped thinking about suicide
It started when i was 12, crying in my room alone every night, writing down why i wanted to die and how life was meaningless. I've been in this state of mind during too many years. 

At first i thought being normal would give me hapiness. So i took care of myself, i discovered sex and social activites in highschool, i discoverded frienship and for a time i really thought this was my purpose, that being average was good and that i was happy. I used to be socially akward and never talk to girls, never go out or talk to anyone. I was living in my imagination, escaping reality with virtual worlds where i was free 

And here i am,  21 yo, i just gave up my garbage engineering school . I want more, i want to fight, figthing for girls and being cool was futile, i want to succeed. I m working hard my maths and physics to get a better school next year. I was blind, but now i can finally see the beauty  behind the maths, the meaning of it. 

We are just animals, everything we do is useless. We are nothing, with the body and the mind of an ape. So we need to give everything we can to keep this body in a good state. I was an alcooholic and drug addict, i only lived in false worlds. I'm done now, no more suicidal thoughts, no more bullshit. 

I realized i was addicted to video games, my phone, music, parties, sex and other drugs. This helped me a lot in my evolution, getting away from these things saved me. I hope it will help you too
