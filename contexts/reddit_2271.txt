As all you seniors stressed the hell out about college/school, remember to have a good time.
So a few days ago, I had my last hang out with my high school friends.  Now tomorrow I go off for my first day of college, and I'd just like to remind all of you in high school (especially seniors) to have a good time. 


Right now, you're doing the things that you'll be looking back at before going off to college, so make them count.


Go take that road trip you've been talking about with your buddies.  Even if it means saving up some extra cash


Go ask out that person you've been stalking.  Even if the chances are one in 14,000,605.


That hair color you wanted to dye your hair, DO IT.


Make as many memories as you can with your buddies, because when you're reminiscing about the past four years of high school, I hope that you can remember more than grinding your nose in the books.


 Yes, academics are important, but so is having fun with the people close to you.


I wish there was a way to know you're in the good old days before you've actually left them.
