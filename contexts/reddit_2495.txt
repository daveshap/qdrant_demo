Can an 30 year old unskilled loser still scrape together a decent career?
I’m (30F) with no career but would love a decent job with people around my age that pays well or is respectable.

The only thing is I’m a loser and don’t have many skills or qualifications. I did a classical history degree I got the lowest possible grade - a Third (I’m in the UK, I was suffering with mental health issues at the time). I blew my chance at a good degree and  unfortunately a second degree is not an option as I can’t get funding for it a second one.

I work as admin in a hospital (low pay, dead end job)  and I’m surrounded by achievers who are doctors and nurses and I want to better myself.

I’m not good at maths /complicated topics and I struggle with talking to people. I was thinking about doing an online degree in illustration or graphic design as they cost about a third of on campus degree. I’m not sure if it would work or if I would get a good job out of it.

I love to draw, design and write but I only came across drawing in my mid twenties and I’m self taught and although I’m not very good I do enjoy it.

I’m not sure what options I have left as I don’t know what courses, roles I can do without the relevant degree or experience. Any advice would be greatly appreciated:)

Edit: Thank you everyone so much for all your suggestions. I’ll try and use all this advice. :)
