Alternative to relay (switching 12V with 12V accesory in car) What are the other alternatives to relay would be for switching 12V battery power rail with accesory (ignition) power? I'm trying to find an alternative, because the relay is too big for my application, I'm looking for something what's is more compact than the relay. Power load is about 150mA. I can't connect my application directly to accesory, because max rated power load for accesory is 150mA.
