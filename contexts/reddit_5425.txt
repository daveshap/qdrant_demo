My friend had the experience for the job, but got passed up because he had the wrong bachelors degree? Is this common?
My friend works in tech and had a few years of IT experience.  He got rejected from a job that required an IT degree.  His degree isn’t IT, but the experience they were looking for matched the experience he had.

I mean I guess I can see why since it’s not the right degree, but I’d thought what you did in the previous job should circumvent that.
