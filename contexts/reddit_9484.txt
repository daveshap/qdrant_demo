As a millennial: Don't forget about coupons!
I went to the grocery store with my roommate \(25 y/o male\) on Sunday, and bought two sticks of deodorant. There was a little tab under the price tag that said "Coupon Available on the \[Kroger\] app!".

I logged into the app, and it turns out the coupon was buy\-one\-get\-one\-free. So, I got the second stick for free, just for the effort of checking the app. I also had another coupon for my breakfast that was $0.50 off of a $1.49 item \(that I bought four of because they are shelf\-stable\). So, all together, I saved myself $4 for three minutes' worth of work.

My roommate was laughing at the fact that I used *two* coupons in a sitting. I asked him why he was laughing, and he said "Coupons are for old ladies and weirdos." Well, sticks and stones.

Obviously, like everything, there's got to be a balance, but I've resolved to check the coupons before heading over to the grocery.
