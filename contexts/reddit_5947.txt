Planning on getting my associates in buisness management, is there room for growth?
I’ve always loved buisness, and this is what i’ve decided I want to pursue a career in. I’m not sure where to start when I get my degree though. I have a few years experience being management assistant but i’m just wondering what the future holds for that specifically. Is there any good jobs that require a buisness management degree that pay well? Thanks.
