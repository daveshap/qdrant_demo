MARY: Children, I want you to be very good and very quiet while I see Mrs. Wheeler a moment. She's going to take over this class for a while.
NANCY: Why
MARY: Because I have something very important to do.
NANCY: What?
MARY: I'll be right back with Mrs. Wheeler.
NANCY: When?
BRUNS: The acceptance of a secret is an obligation and in this case my dear, the obligation carried with it the necessity of dying if one betrayed that secret. You understand that don't you?
JACQUELINE: Yes, I understand.
BRUNS: Then, you also understand that you must die.
JACQUELINE: No.
MRS. CORTEZ: Jacqueline, you have spoken so often of ending it all, I can't understand why this should be so difficult for you. You have only to drink a little.
MRS. REDI: Yes, Jacqueline. You were always talking suicide - - of ending your life when you wanted to.
JACQUELINE: When I wanted to.
BRUNS: It doesn't matter. You want to now. You should want to. It's your obligation, your duty.
MRS. REDI: You have only to stretch out your hand, take up the glass and drink a little.
MRS. CORTEZ: It won't hurt.
