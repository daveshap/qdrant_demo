Question about thank you notes after an interview
I just interviewed for a student affairs position in which half the search committee was made up of faculty members. I'm not sure whether to address my thank you notes to Dr. So-and-so or just to their first names. Unfortunately I can't remember how they introduced themselves. Any opinions?

Thanks!
