How to politely decline going to my work's holiday dinner?
I don't want to go to my work's holiday dinner on Thursday. Only problem is I said yes by mistake (felt pressured and wasn't really thinking).  It's a small office of 5 so my absence will be noticed. What can I say that won't piss everyone off too much? I work with a bunch of nosy people and they're going to ask a million questions. I don't like my job and have no plans to stay there long term. Some people might say it won't matter what I tell them then but I have bad anxiety and don't want to deal with any attitude for the remaining time I'm there.  Any advice would be appreciated, thanks
