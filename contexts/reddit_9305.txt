Insulin is crazy expensive
I recently have been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. In less than one month I've spent over 500$ on diabetic supplies and insulin and I have insurance. My 8 day supply of insulin is 45$, my libra scanner is 75$ a month and my long active insulin is more than that. Its extremely frustrating trying to keep up with the rising cost of my medication without getting a pay raise or a cost of living raise.

Just want to say thank you to everyone for being helpful and compassionate. Several people have been able to give me multiple options for avenues to look at for cheaper options for insulin, some great information aswell. 
I have been trying to follow a low carb keto type lifestyle diet, although food/diet wasnt an issue before. 
I'm going to try to combat this disease with a good diet, exercise and  my insulin.  
Thank you all again so much for all the help and well wishes.
