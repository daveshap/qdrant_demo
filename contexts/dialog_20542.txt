BILLINGS: You expect to hold Cornwallis with militia?
MARION: I expect to try.
BILLINGS: Trust you and Harry Lee. Remember that damned overland you two thought up in '62 to hit Fort Louis?
MARION: It worked. How many men can you raise?
BILLINGS: Not many. Dalton, Scott, they've got their reasons; Rev. Oliver, he believes in the cause; some of the young bucks; a few like me with nothing to lose... What about you? You've got a lot to lose.
