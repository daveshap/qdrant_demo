SGT. MCMANUS: He may have a point, Lieutenant. Two strong boys would be able to defend themselves against one man.
LT. VILLIERS: Sgt. McManus, are you suggesting that David and Jack were, in fact, attacked by some animal and that the officialdom of East Proctor has conspired to keep it a secret? We have an autopsy report on the murderer who was shot in the act by the local police. We have two witnesses to the crime. You'll forgive me, Mr. Kessler, if I consider your testimony as coming from someone who has gone through a terrible shock.
SGT. MCMANUS: Lieutenant, the boy seems pretty lucid to me and...
