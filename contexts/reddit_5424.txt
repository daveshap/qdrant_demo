Resources to brush up on my SQL and Excel skills?
The second round of my interview process includes a SQL and Excel assessment. I’m all right with Excel; it’s the SQL I have to refresh myself on. Any suggestions for free, effective, effective resources on sharpening my skills in preparation? Is there a preferred resource you like in particular?

Thanks
