\*\*this was actually removed for shitpost but it's (unfortunately) not a shitpost\*\*\*

Edit: Holy crap thank you everyone!! Wasn't expecting this much attention i love you guys. For background, I'm female and my entire family of 6 has it now. Living in NYC :( . I haven't left my house since March 6. My parents are/were doctors/nurses treating coronavirus patients. I so far just have cold symptoms as do my brothers, but my mom is feeling shortness of breath and pneumonia symptoms :((

Edit 2: But got into two ivies!!
