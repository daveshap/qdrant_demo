I lied to the therapist.
It was my first therapy session in 9 years. I'm pretty sure I lied about every single thing I said (including cutting and depression and drug use especially) He said his patients lie to him all the time, like he could tell. I wish I could go back and be honest, but I'll have to wait for a month till next session.

 I didn't realize how full of shit I've become. So that's been bothering me,quite a bit.
