TED: Am I one... or many?
ELLIE: The librarian... or the library...?
ELLIE: ... all those voices... you gather them all together. Millions of intelligences in one consciousness... and now we're a part of it.
TED: You always have been. We're all descendants of the same stars, Ellie. All made of the same primordial atoms.
ELLIE: So. What happens now?
TED: Now... you go home.
ELLIE: No! I mean... why so soon?
TED: If we don't engineer a consistent causality it'll work itself out on its own, and that's almost always worse. Ellie, according to your physics none of this is possible. A lot of it you're simply not capable of understanding, not yet. No offense.
ELLIE: None taken... but ... do we get to come back? Others of my kind, I mean.
TED: Eventually you'll get here on your own. This was just the first step; in time you'll take another.
ELLIE: But -- other people from our planet should see what I've seen -- they should witness this for themselves.
TED: That isn't the way it works.
ELLIE: But you said you wanted to help -- don't you see what it would mean?
TED: No more stalling, Captain.
ELLIE: Please -- if you... downloaded... everything about us you know the problems we face, the impact it could have -- it could make the difference --
TED: Ellie... this is the way it's been done for billions of years...
