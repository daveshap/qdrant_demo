How to make your professors notice/remember you?
Hi! I hope this is the right place for this question! Next year will be my last one, and I'm trying to get a better relationship with my professors, especially since I've seen so many friends needing recommendations or help from past professors. No matter how I think of it I can't image one of my past professors remembering me, so even less accepting to write something for me. One of my friends even got into a well know program after the list closed because one of her professors vouched for her (she was late because she didn't want to attend, but her recently new job required her to). If I had to do that now I'd be mortified. Whenever I ask her she tells me she doesn't do anything out of the ordinary.

The thing is, I've always been quite shy and I can go a whole semester without talking more than a couple of words with my professors. I never knew it was important, and I always thought that was something that only "sweet-talkers" did. Now I know that I've made myself look uninterested. So! Can you please give me tips on how to act on class/talk to professors/what to do so they know that I exist? Thanks!
