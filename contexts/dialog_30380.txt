BOYD: Bury her out in the desert.
ADAM: Sure, why not.
MOORE: He's right.
BOYD: We can take her out to Red Rock. Find some quiet place...and put her in the ground.
ADAM: You don't just casually walk out of a Vegas Casino with a dead woman.
BOYD: We can do this. We can get her out of here.
ADAM: Have you completely lost your mind? So you get her out of here. So you get her out into the desert somehow, without anybody seeing, so what, you don't think at some point somebody might notice that she's gone?
BOYD: Nobody knows she's here. I called her personally. Nobody knows.
FISHER: Oh for Christsake Boyd. Somebody must know she's here.
BOYD: Nobody knows.
ADAM: Her blood is all over the bathroom. I'd say that's a bit of a DNA problem.
BOYD: It's a marble floor, we can clean it up.
FISHER: Oh God. This is insane.
BOYD: What's insane is the fact that Micheal here put a fucking girl's head through a toilet. That's insane.
MOORE: They'll get us on accesory to murder.
ADAM: Bullshit it's not accesory. I didn't do shit. You call the cops, you explain it was an accident...
BOYD: Her fucking head was caved in.
ADAM: So I didn't fucking do it!
BOYD: She's got bondage burns on her wrists. There's blow all over the room, Moore looks like he went at it with a mountain lion. This room looks like the Manson Family stayed here a month. Micheal goes down, we all go down.
MOORE: I'm not going to ruin my life over a dead whore.
ADAM: That's a horrible ugly comment. Dead whore?" She's a person!"
FISHER: I'm getting married...
MICHEAL: I'm sorry...I'm sorry...I'm sorry...
