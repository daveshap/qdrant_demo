Synonym for \"controls\" meaning switches and buttons etc Talking about a control panel with multiple switches, dials, knobs, lights and buttons, I am looking for a synonym for \"controls\" (and the singular \"control\").  I have \"instrument panel\" or \"dashboard\" as synonyms for \"control panel\but nothing else that exactly seems to cover the collection itself.\"Instruments\" is the closest I can find, but to me that implies larger items such as a speedometer that can include multiple dials and buttons, rather than just the buttons or switches themselves.  So it works in the second example, less well in the first and not in the third.Example uses:\"All the \"x\" on the dashboard had been set to their emergency positions\"\"George swept his hand over the \"x\" rapidly preparing for liftoff.\"   \"This \"x\" was a three-way switch instead of the usual button.\"
