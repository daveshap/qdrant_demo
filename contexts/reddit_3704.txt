How can I get a boyfriend when I'm a girl who isn't feminine or attractive?
I know who I am, and what I'm comfortable with. I'm a girl, and I don't enjoy being feminine or showing off my curves or wearing anything feminine, putting on makeup etc. I am by definition a tomboy. I lift weights for my strength training, and compete in boxing and I have a short haircut, as well as a muscular physique. Before I cut my hair short, I actually looked like a woman, but now I'm told I look like a dude. How can I find a boyfriend with all of this? I know that I don't want to change any part of myself, and as much as it sucks, men aren't attracted to women like me.
