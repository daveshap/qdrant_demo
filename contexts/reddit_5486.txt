Foreign high-school diploma but US degree, do I need to take the GED?
Foreign high-school diploma but US college degree, do I need to take the GED?

As the title says, I’m running into a bizarre conundrum. I’m looking to switch careers and I require a high-school diploma (trades apprenticeship/community college requirements). I did graduate high-school, but not in the US. And I hold a BS and an MS degree so I am obviously qualified to be considered. 

However, archaic eligibility requirements mean college transcripts are ok but high-school diplomas are more important. I do not have official copies, and the schools in my country would require I need to show up and make a request in person, which will take upwards of 30 days to get. As an alternative, can I just take the GED? 

Has anyone run into this problem? It seems ridiculous, but it is what it is. I guess I am charting a non-traditional path and breaking the system...Any advice appreciated!
