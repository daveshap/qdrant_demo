What’s a polite way to tell a recruiter to get to the point?
When a recruiter contacts you (on LinkedIN) they always say how they were “pleasantly suprised to find your profile”, “how <company X> is an expanding company offering many opportunities” and “how you would be a perfect fit”. Then they always propose to schedule a call to “have an explorative conversation about my future”.

I get it. Recruiters are in part paid to be sympathetic and social people, and you catch more flies with honey than vinegar. But I don’t want to call every recruiter that comes knocking. On the other hand I do want to hear them out to see if this indeed could be an interesting opportunity for me. So what’s a respectful way to inquire about the salary, benefits and just to ask the recruiter to get down to the brass tacks of the job before we continue?

Thank you.
