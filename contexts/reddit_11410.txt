The arts are getting the shit-end of the stick. Again.
The Dean of Arts at my university is recommending that more than 20 arts programs be suspended. The **Dean of Arts**.  They say it's due to low enrollment. Well when you have one of the best theatre programs in all of Canada, yet restrict seats to 8-10 per year, competition and requirements tend to be high. If you're worried about numbers, open seats, allow more students to enroll and give you money that ***you keep saying that you need so desperately to continue***.  The facilities are there, we can fit well more than the numbers you allow. 

I'm saying this because my comments would probably be moderated in the comments of the article I read.
