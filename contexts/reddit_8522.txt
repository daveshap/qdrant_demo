State pension funds run the gamut of being more than 100% funded to having around a 1/3 budgeted. How do states that have not fully funded their pension programs makeup the difference? Are there any advantages/disadvantages to a state for fully funding their pension system?
States like South Dakota and Wisconsin have fully budgeted [pension programs](https://taxfoundation.org/state-pension-plan-funding-2019/), while Kentucky only has 34% planned. 

Kentucky is not alone in under funding its pension program:

> Twenty states have pension plans that are less than two-thirds funded, and five states have pension plans that are less than 50 percent funded.
