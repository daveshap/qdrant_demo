I'm bisexual and I have nobody to talk to about that.
I'm 22yo male. All my life I have been dating girls. Last night I slept with one guy I met at a party. I've slept with 3 males so far. I'm scared that they will tell someone. My friends don't know about me being bisexual and I think they wouldn't accept that. I know that "true friends will accept anything" but not in this case. I have nobody to talk to about my situation and I'm afraid to come out. I don't know what to do. This is a throwaway. Should I tell my friends and risk losing them?
