My dad got fired from the only job he's ever had after our family moved across the country. How can I help him get back on his feet with no degree?
My dad is 48 and the father of 6 children (two are pretty financially independent and out of school, while my sister and I are in college back in our previous state and have had to borrow money a few times...). He doesn't have a degree, though he recalls almost completing an associate's through CC in the early 90s.

Over the summer, my parents moved to Salt Lake City to be closer to family. They moved into my grandparents' basement until they found a house. In September, he lost the only proper job he has had. In this I.T./business process outsourcing company, he's had a few different titles- though he refers to himself as a Business Analyst.

He's one of the most intelligent creative, hard working and charismatic people I know, but he has ADHD and can seem a little unmotivated at times. My Mom picked up a job as a pharmacy technician at CVS- I came home for the holidays hoping my dad might have leads or interviews, but the most that's happened is meeting with a representative from the LDS career center once or twice a week (my family is Mormon). He recently looked at taking some courses through their "pathway" program, which helps set you up towards a degree with a partnering school- I'm not sure if he will end up doing it.

I haven't looked at his resume. I don't know much about the job market for people with his background, but with 22 years of experience, he knows at least the ins and outs of data management and his way around a computer- I'm sure he's qualified to handle more.

He needs some nudges and is probably feeling a little hopeless without a degree- what can I do to give him some help in this job search?
