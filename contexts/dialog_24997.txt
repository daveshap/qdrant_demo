BETH: What's wrong, Norman?
NORMAN: I'm feeling better.
BETH: Are you?
BETH: It's getting cold.
NORMAN: You think I'd really drink that?
BETH: You don't think I put something in it, do you?
NORMAN: You put explosives around the habitat, I can't imagine what you'd put in a drink.
BETH: I did do that, didn't I?
NORMAN: How do you feel about snakes?
BETH: Snakes? What do you mean, exactly?
NORMAN: You know what I mean.
BETH: Am I afraid of them? Not during the day. Sea snakes are diurnal. When the sun's out, they don't bite. Fortunately for you, I had on my watch. This is quite good.
NORMAN: What are they doing down here? In the bathroom? Suddenly appearing.
BETH: You tell me.
NORMAN: Do you fear them?
BETH: Don't you?
NORMAN: Are you manifesting them?
BETH: If I was, then I would've had to have gone in the sphere, wouldn't I?
NORMAN: Did you?
BETH: What's the phrase -- keeping up with the Joneses"?"
NORMAN: Why did you go in the sphere, Beth?
BETH: Same reason I put explosives around the habitat. For defense. For the power. To protect myself.
NORMAN: Against what? Harry's unconscious. He's not a threat.
BETH: No, he isn't.
NORMAN: He can't manifest.
BETH: No, he can't.
NORMAN: Then why, Beth? Why go in? Why put out explosives? Why manifest the snakes?
BETH: You think I manifested the snakes?
NORMAN: Someone did.
BETH: Yes, someone did. But it wasn't me, Norman. It was you. You manifested the snakes.
NORMAN: Beth you're losing it. C'mon.
BETH: C'mon -- what?
NORMAN: You're lying --
BETH: Am I lying? Are you sure? Are you absolutely sure I'm lying? Then explain to me about the jellyfish. Earlier. Why did we see jellyfish? Harry doesn't fear jellyfish. You do. They're your fear, aren't they?
NORMAN: But --
BETH: And the snakes? You want to know about the snakes? You saw one outside earlier, didn't you? When you thought I had deserted you -- you were terrified.
NORMAN: That's when you went in the sphere.
BETH: One lonely, terrifying sea snake.
NORMAN: You manifested that, Beth.
BETH: Did I? Or was that you? When you were hiding in the bathroom -- all conspiratorially like you were -- you became frightened, didn't you? Terrified. Like you were with the snake earlier -- and suddenly you have snakes slithering all over the floor. You did that, Norman.
NORMAN: You're insane.
BETH: Am I? Or am I making so much sense that you're going insane?
NORMAN: I never went in that sphere.
BETH: You don't remember you did. But I'm sure you remember running like some fucking hero to get Harry, don't you? You remember that.
NORMAN: Yes.
BETH: You remember before you picked him up -- when you looked up at the sphere, you remember that -- when the sphere opened? That's right. But you can't remember going inside, can you? No, of course not. Harry couldn't either, could he? Like everything's on the tip of my tongue"
NORMAN: That's bullshit.
BETH: Is it?
NORMAN: Beth, the message said Harry. My name is Harry". My name isn't Harry."
BETH: No, it isn't. Your name is Norman. But your younger brother -- what was his name? The one who was stung when you were younger. The one that died. The one you couldn't save. What was his name? Mommy
NORMAN: Shut up, Beth --
BETH: When you were in that sub -- and that squid was attacking you -- are you sure it was the squid that was attacking? Do you know? I can't get Beth on the radio. I'm in this tiny sub on the bottom of the fucking ocean. All alone. Surrounded by all this water." Was it really the squid that was attacking you
BETH: I'm not scaring you, am I Norman? I hope I'm not frightening you. The last thing I want to do is frighten you. You feel okay, don't you?
NORMAN: It's not me, Beth. I swear. It can't be.
BETH: It's not me
NORMAN: Don't, Beth.
BETH: But I have to, Norman.
NORMAN: I promise --
BETH: Promise what, Norman? Tell me!
NORMAN: Beth --
BETH: You think I'd belive you? Believe anything you might say now? After you lied to me about telling Barnes about my past. About my problems. My problems. Not yours. Not his. Mine.
NORMAN: Don't, Beth. Please.
BETH: It's either this... or I kill you.
