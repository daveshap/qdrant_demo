Is there evidence Michael Cohen committed perjury in his testimony to the House Oversight Committee this past Wednesday?
On Wednesday, [Michael Cohen testified in front of the House Oversight Committee](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/02/27/ex-trump-lawyer-michael-cohen-testify-house-oversight-committee/2995659002/).

After Cohen's testimony, Representative Jim Jordan suggested that Cohen may have committed perjury, [citing several specific examples](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/could-michael-cohen-be-prosecuted-for-committing-perjury-again).

Outside of Congress, some have pointed to specific instances they believe Cohen may have not told the truth, such as his claim that [he was offered the job he wanted at the White House](https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/432140-michael-cohens-perjury-problem-witnesses-refute-testimony-about-not).

Republican lawmakers [have asked the Justice Department to investigate](https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/28/politics/house-criminal-referral-michael-cohen/index.html).

I have a couple of questions on this topic:

1: Is there evidence Michael Cohen committed perjury?

2: What leniency is provided in correcting testimony, or what is the standard of proving a willful lie as stated in [18 U.S. Code § 1621](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1621)?
