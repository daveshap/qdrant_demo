What is your opinion of a person at work that is very quiet?
Not to mention, I’m one of the newer employees and the youngest. I’ve been at my current job for 8 months and started with someone the same time. She’s older than me but friendly with everyone. Another advisor started a few months after us but got the job because she used to work with our boss. She’s older too but gets along with everyone. Essentially everyone I work with talks amongst each other. I don’t talk unless spoken to, only a few people talk to me. I’m very quiet and I feel like I will be disregarded for possible promotions/training opportunities because of how quiet I am. My  boss had to ask me when I first started within my first 3 months if I had an issue with anyone because I don’t talk. I just have a fear of coming across as stupid and terrible time trusting people. I don’t hear complaints about me but I just refuse to open up. Is there an issue or should I be worried?
