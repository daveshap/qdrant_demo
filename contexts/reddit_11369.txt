Omegle friend
So i met this person on Omegle and we got along real well. at first we were messing with each other then we gradually started to get to know each other. we talked for at least 3 hours having fun making each other laugh. Im not sure if its just me but i could tell we were becoming friends. we told each other our names im pretty sure we became as good as friends as 2 people over the internet can get. we started to get tired and as i ask them if they were tired and they started typing, first it was 1 minute, the 3, then 5 then 20. and it still said stranger is typing. i waited forever and then i came to terms with it. they probably lagged out or something since the said they were using a phone. Tori you were a good friend for the time i knew you i just wished we could of kept intact. i know its just someone i met over the internet it shouldn't be that big of a deal but it is to me she was really funny and nice person.
