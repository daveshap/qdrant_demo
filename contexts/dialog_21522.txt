BLOOM: Oh, I fell on my keys. I've got to get out of here.
BIALYSTOCK: You miserable, cowardly, wretched little caterpillar. Don't you ever want to become a butterfly? Don't you want to spread your wings and flap your way to glory?
BLOOM: You're going to jump on me.
BLOOM: You're going to jump on me. I know you're going to jump on me -- like Nero jumped on Poppea.
BIALYSTOCK: What???
BLOOM: Poppea. She was his wife. And she was unfaithful to him. So he got mad and he jumped on her. Up and down, up and down, until he squashed her like a bug. Please don't jump on me.
BIALYSTOCK: I'm not going to jump on you!
BLOOM: Aaaaaaaaaa!
BIALYSTOCK: Will you get a hold on yourself.
BLOOM: Don't touch me! Don't touch me!
BIALYSTOCK: What are you afraid of? I'm not going to hurt you! What's the matter with you?
BLOOM: I'm hysterical. I'm having hysterics. I'm hysterical. I can't stop. When I get like this, I can't stop. I'm hysterical.
