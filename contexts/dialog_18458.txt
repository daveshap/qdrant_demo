LONGFELLOW: Now, where were we?
DOUGLAS: You see, Mr. Deeds, the opera is not conducted like any ordinary business.
LONGFELLOW: Why not?
DOUGLAS: Because it just isn't a business, that's all!
LONGFELLOW: Well, maybe it isn't to you, but it certainly is a business to me, if I have to make up a loss of $180,000. If it's losing that much money, there must be something wrong. Maybe you charge too much. Maybe you're selling bad merchandise. Maybe lots of things. I don't know. You see, I expect to do a lot of good with that money. And I can't afford to put it into anything that I don't look into. That's my decision for the time being, gentlemen. Goodbye, and thank you for making me Chairman.
