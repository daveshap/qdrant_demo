ROSE: Mr. Hillyer, I know it was bad and I hadn't ought to of done it. But I'm only a human girl and I... I ain't always perfect. I promise I won't let him in the house no more, I promise. Won't you and Mrs. Hillyer forgive me?
DADDY: Rose, darlin', you break my heart. But I am only a human man myself of the father variety. Rose, pack your bag, baby, as of this moment you are hired, mired and fired.
DADDY: Well, Rose, going out to look for a job today?
ROSE: What's the use, there ain't none.
DADDY: Mmm. Would you get me another half a-cup of coffee, dear?
DADDY: It has been three weeks since I fired" her. Is there no way to get rid of this girl? Are we stuck with her for life?"
MOTHER: She can't get a job, it's a depression. And we can't just throw her out on the street.
DADDY: The hell we can't.
MOTHER: Rose, you don't look well and you haven't eaten a bit of breakfast.
ROSE: I'm not hungry. I can't eat nothin', I haven't been able to eat since I got fired. I think maybe I'm sick.
DADDY: God forbid. You're not sick, Rose, forget it. Don't get any notions in your head, you're not sick.
ROSE: Yes, sir.
MOTHER: She does look a little peaky.
DADDY: No, she doesn't, she's fine, fine. She's perfectly healthy, don't give her ideas.
