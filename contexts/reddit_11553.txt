I hate taking my pills, but I hate being off them.
I'm bipolar and so freaking manic right now and all I want to do is sit down and play a game of chess, but no. I can't even remember why I'm not on my meds anymore but I'm really scared to get them back because that will mean admitting to all the people who think I'm faring so well that I'm failing. Failing, failing, failing, and none of it is being helped by the struggle I'm having here at school (I don't even want to be here any more) or the recent rejection I suffered that was timed just perfectly to match up with my last (and most devastating) ex's re-entry into my life. I can't talk to anyone about this, even my other bipolar friend. I hate so much right now and it fucking hurts. and tomorrow it's just as likely that I'll keep hating everything as I'll stay in bed all day because I don't have the spirit to get up. As I said, manic. Sorry all.
