BUD: Oh, Miss Kubelik. How do you feel?
FRAN: Fine. How's your eye?
BUD: Fine.
FRAN: How's everything at the apartment?
BUD: Nothing's changed. You know, we never finished that gin game --
FRAN: I know. I suppose you heard about Mr. Sheldrake --?
BUD: You mean, leaving his wife? Yeah. I'm very happy for you.
FRAN: I never thought he'd do it.
BUD: I told you all along. You see, you were wrong about Mr. Sheldrake.
FRAN: I guess so.
BUD: For that matter, you were wrong about me, too. What you said about those who take and those who get took? Well, Mr. Sheldrake wasn't using me -- I was using him. See? Last month I was at desk 861 on the nineteenth floor -- now I'm on the twenty-seventh floor, paneled office, three windows -- so it all worked out fine -- we're both getting what we want.
FRAN: Yes. You walking to the subway?
BUD: No, thank you. I -- well, to tell you the truth -- -- I have this heavy date for tonight --
FRAN: Oh.
BUD: Aren't you meeting Mr. Sheldrake?
FRAN: No. You know how people talk. So I decided it would be better if we didn't see each other till everything is settled, divorce-wise.
BUD: That's very wise.
FRAN: Good night, Mr. Baxter.
BUD: Good night, Miss Kubelik.
