BRODY: Harbor Air, do you read? Over?
PATROL VOICE: Brody? This is Patrol Base.
BRODY: Where the hell is Air One?
PATROL VOICE: That's what I'd like to know. Lost transmission at Cable Junction.
BRODY: Did he raise the Kids?
PATROL VOICE: Last transmission said ten juve- niles.
BRODY: Yeah? Then what?
PATROL VOICE: Then nothing. If you see him, tell him to switch to an operational frequency, or give me a status report yourself.
BRODY: Did you say Cable Junction?
PATROL VOICE: That's what he said.
BRODY: When?
PATROL VOICE: 1530 hours. Might still be there. Base out.

LUCY: Listen to Andy, Sean.
ANDY: We're throwing a rope and you better catch it, hear?
