JIM: Things are really rotten at home. You wouldn't believe how rotten. Janey's sick. She's unstable, I guess... it's not the right time to tell you... but that's it -- it's like I can't make her happy, the boys can't make her happy, she just doesn't --
ELENA: Jim, maybe we should just go. I've got to look in on the kids. Paul is supposed to be coming back in from the city.
JIM: Jesus, let me make it up to you -- I can do better than that, honestly --
ELENA: Well, we can talk about it.
JIM: That's fine. I wouldn't expect you to see it any other way.
ELENA: Maybe you just need -- look, can you wait here a sec, I need to tidy up -- just a minute, I'll be right back. You'll wait?
JIM: Of course.
BEN: Elena.
ELENA: Ben, I've got a ride home. Maybe you should sleep this one off on the couch here?
BEN: I'll drive you --
ELENA: Ben.
