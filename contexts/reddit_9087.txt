[AMA] Edward Alden, Senior Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations
Hello /r/neutralpolitics! It’s great to be here and I’m looking forward to all of your questions! I am Edward Alden, senior fellow at the [Council on Foreign Relations](http://www.cfr.org/), and director of the CFR [Renewing America initiative](http://blogs.cfr.org/renewing-america/). I’m very excited to be here to discuss issues that I care deeply about, and I hope you find this discussion informative and useful. 

Some background about myself: I was born in Schenectady, New York and grew up mostly in Vancouver, Canada. I was a reporter for much of my career, and worked for a decade for a British newspaper, the Financial Times, where I was most recently the Washington bureau chief. I came to CFR almost 10 years ago now and wrote a book on U.S. immigration policy after 9/11, called [The Closing of the American Border](http://www.amazon.com/Closing-American-Border-Terrorism-Immigration/dp/0061558400/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1256826006&sr=8-2). I have continued to work on immigration and border security issues, which of course have become no less controversial than when I joined CFR. I also covered U.S. trade policy as a reporter dating back to the negotiations on NAFTA and the creation of the World Trade Organization (WTO). My recent work at CFR has been heavily focused on U.S. trade policy and American economic competitiveness. 

We have just released a new book called [How America Stacks Up](http://www.cfr.org/competitiveness/america-stacks-up/p37438?cid=soc-Reddit-in-Alden_AMA-How_America_Stacks_Up), which looks at how the United States compares with other advanced economies on a range of policies that are critical for success in global economic competition – such as education, infrastructure, tax policy, worker retraining and innovation. We told the story in part through the use of infographics that distill the big conclusions in graphic form, and I encourage you to have a look. 

All of my publications can be found [here](http://www.cfr.org/experts/economics-immigration-trade-competitiveness/edward-alden/b2472#publications), so feel free to browse beforehand if you have the time.

I’ll be on starting at 12:00 p.m. EST and answering questions through 2:00 p.m. EST. I’ll try my best to get to all of your questions.
