SAM: You're really doing a great job here, Josie. I like your can do" attitude."
JOSIE: Thanks. They weren't related to Humpty Dumpty, were they? Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee?
SAM: Maybe distant cousins. They did have that egg shape in common.
JOSIE: But Humpty Dumpty was alone.
SAM: That's sad, isn't it? He had to sit on that wall all by himself. He deserved to have somebody.
JOSIE: That's really what we all need, right? Someone to sit up on the wall with us--
SAM: Yeah. To watch the world go by.--
JOSIE: To put us back together again when we fall.
SAM: Our penguin, right?
JOSIE: Do you think you'll find her?
SAM: Yeah, actually I do.
SAM: Oh my God! I almost forgot--I got you a meeting with the admissions guy from Dartmouth!
JOSIE: What! But--I wasn't even going to go to college--
SAM: No, I know, but I pulled some strings, got him to look at your writing, and he agreed to meet you.
JOSIE: Oh--yikes!
SAM: told him --if I'm wrong about this girl, you can take away my teaching certificate!
JOSIE: Wow. You believe in me that much--
SAM: Of course I do. Josie, you owe it to yourself--to your writing, to go to college. You're a great writer. You just have to find your story.
GUS: That's your story!
JOSIE: You're crazy. I can't--I can't-no. No.
GUS: It's got it all--sex, intrigue, immorality in the education system--
JOSIE: He's my teacher!
GUS: And that's the best part. Teacher-Student Relations: How close is too close?" We're gonna blow the lid off it!"
JOSIE: There is no lid! Nothing's going on between Sam and me. Coulson. Mr. Sam Coulson and me.
GUS: Not yet. Every person in this office comes in here and watches you guys! It's like the goddamn Young and the Restless! Rigfort's salivating over it.
JOSIE: You already pitched this to Rigfort?!
