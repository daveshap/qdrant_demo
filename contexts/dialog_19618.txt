NANCY: I know who's trying to kill you.
KINCAID: Don't fucking humor us. We're not in the mood.
NANCY: He wears a dirty brown hat. He's horribly burned. He has razors on his right hand.
TARYN: Who is he?
NANCY: Freddy Krueger. He was a child murderer before he died. After he died, he became ...something worse. Six years ago Freddy killed my friends. He almost killed me. I thought I got rid of him -- but I guess he was too strong.
WILL: Why is he after us?
TARYN: Yeah? What did we ever do?
