remote Ipython notebook There is a powerful computer(Ubuntu in it) in our office. We want to use ipython notebook using power of that computer. That PC owner also uses Ipython on it. I have tried to connect via ssh, but something goes wrong. I used MobaXterm to connect. Who knows how to do it? <br>P.S. Is there any way to do it live code for local PCs, using Ipython (not needed, will be awesome to know it)
