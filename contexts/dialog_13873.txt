RACHEL: Will.
WILL: There've been other cases. Where we've changed results. Pushed witnesses. Manipulated evidence. But Dobbs. I wanted Dobbs more than anything.
RACHEL: What if someone finds out?
WILL: We're under investigation now. Back in Seattle. Hap wanted to talk. As soon as we got back. Thought he could work out some kind of deal.
