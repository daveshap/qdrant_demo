Changing tense from past to present and back I'm writing something and I'm having trouble figuring out which of these two is correct. My gut feeling is that the first is correct and the second isn't, but also I think there might be no rule against either.I thought the residents of EL&amp;U might be able to confirm.<blockquote>    Given the context, and what I now know about X, if I had requested it under my own initiative I would expect you to have counseled me against it.  Given the context, and what I now know about X, if I had requested it under my own initiative I would have expected you to counsel me against it.  </blockquote>EDITAs some have pointed out, it's hard for respondents to give a good answer because they don't know what X is, nor do they know the context.I won't give the context fully except to say it's professional negligence - X is a particular procedure which one can buy as a service from a professional. So the context is visiting a professional with a pre-existing problem, and being offered a non-essential extra which carried a risk of causing the same problem.Incorporating this into my first sentence would make it read like so:<blockquote>  Given the context of functional problems, and what I now know about X - namely that it can itself cause the same functional problems - if I had requested it under my own initiative I would expect you to have counseled me against it.</blockquote>Taking all this into account, I think it might be wise to just keep things in the present:<blockquote>  Given what I now know about X, if I did request it under my own initiative in the same context I would expect you to counsel me against it.</blockquote>EDIT2What I'm trying to convey is that I expect the professional to have an obligation to counsel me against this procedure because it carries a risk of causing a problem which I already have and for which I have sought their help.
