FRANK: You all right?
JACK: Yeah, fine.
FRANK: Okay I'll see you tomorrow night then.
JACK: Right.
SUSIE: Where's egghead?
JACK: His kid's sick.
SUSIE: I don't know. It's hard figuring you two as brothers. Seems like the hospital might've scrambled the babies somewhere.
JACK: He takes after our mother.
SUSIE: Yeah,well, a11 I know is mother nature must be one crazy dame. Shit.
SUSIE: Uh-uh. I never touch American cigarettes. What's tomorrow again?
JACK: The Stratford.
SUSIE: Nice place. Fulla velvet. Even the bedspreads. Damn! Two-fifty a pack and I go through 'em like toothpicks. Twelve-and-a-half cents a piece, you believe that?
JACK: Huh?
SUSIE: Paris Opals. Twelve-and-a-half cents. I sat down with a pencil and added it one day. But I figure, if you're gonna be sticking something in your mouth, you might as well make it the best. Ah, here's a lost soul.
SUSIE: Mmm. Like kissing a rose. Well, au revoir.
JACK: Hey. You feel like a cup of coffee?
SUSIE: You kidding? We must've killed three pots in there. Anyway, I gotta get home. Rest the pipes.
JACK: You want me to walk you?
SUSIE: No. Thanks. She starts to move away, then stops and looks back.
SUSIE: Hey, listen. You're not going soft on me, are you? I mean, you're not gonna start dreaming about me and waking up all sweaty and looking at me like I'm some kinda princess when I burp.
JACK: Forget it.
SUSIE: I mean, that'd be too creepy. With us working together and all.
JACK: Forget it.
SUSIE: Nothing personal --
