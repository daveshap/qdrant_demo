UK Standard Visitor Visa for Indonesian citizen I am a Spanish citizen currently living in London, UK. I  have an Indonesian boyfriend and we are in a long distance relationship, I usually go to visit him (I have been going for almost 2 years). Now we would like to apply for a visitor visa for him to come to UK and visit his sister who is a citizen, but she is on benefits so she can not sponsor him financially. We would then go to Spain to visit my family. We have looked at the application process and there are couple of circumstances which are making things more complicated. I can support him during his stay but I am not a UK citizen so I cannot sponsor him. His sister or some other friends can sponsor him but not support him financially. He has no permanent job in Indonesia as he is a painter and a driver so he cannot provide any letter from employer.I was foolish because I thought we might need the flight to demonstrate that he will leave the country, and I already bought a ticket. Also, he heard that asking for multiply entry is impossible if it is the first time he wants to come to the UK. The plan was for him to come to the UK, we then go visit my family for 3 weeks in Spain, and return to the UK to take the return flight to Indonesia.So many questions and nobody to answer them so I am struggling trying to find help.
