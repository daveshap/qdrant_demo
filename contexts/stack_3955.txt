Should training data in each batch size be resample only one time or at each epoch when using mini-batch I saw some related question regarding to the fact is one should use sampling with resampling or without when using minibatch.However my question is different.Let's assume that I use sampling witouth replacement. Meaning that for each epoch one training example can only belong one 'batch size' group.I want to know if one should only resample the training data (into the different batch size) only 1 time or before to start to update the parameters before each epoch.For instance suppose I have 20 'batch size' group. Suppose at the first iteration I have sampled picture A in group 2 and picture B in group 4.If so should picture A always stay in group 2 and picture B in group 4. Or should I resample it before to start a new epoch (e.g. at epoch 2 put picture B in group 6 and picture B in group 20).
