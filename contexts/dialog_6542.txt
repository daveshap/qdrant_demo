HELEN: Hello, Daryll Lee.
DARYLL: You read my book which as you know, hit the stands a couple of weeks ago. You read it yet.
HELEN: What book?
DARYLL: I sent it by private courier, he didn't give it to you? That son of a gun...!
HELEN: I'll look for it, Daryll Lee.
DARYLL: Bet you never figured I'd follow in your footsteps. It's real well- written. You should read it -- you're in it.
HELEN: I will. I'll call you, Daryll, and talk to you about it after I've read it. Right now I have a question... Peter Kurten.
DARYLL: Kurten! Is he bothering you? I told that son I'd send him what he wanted if he leave you alone.
HELEN: Ah ha. What did he want?
DARYLL: Something personal. Is he bothering you?
HELEN: I don't know. I'd like to know where he is.
DARYLL: Listen, you want my advice? Steer clear. He's writing me he's gonna finish 'my unfinished symphony.' He's gonna give me $550 for some of my cum, he says he's in a position to see that I will be immortal if he has some of my spunk. I'm offended. Right away I smell <u>freak</u>. Writin' about him and me and <u>you</u> bein' joined and he's gonna finish my <u>symphony</u>? I didn't care for his drift. I sent some liquid soap in a sandwich baggie with a message from Jesus to mend his ways. You hear I found Jesus? And what's funny is, now I don't mind bein' inside. If I was out, even Born Again, I'd probably get restless again. It's maybe better I stay here, what do you think?
HELEN: I think whatever is best for you, Daryll. And maybe you're right, that's the place.
DARYLL: You come and visit.
HELEN: Where did you send the message to Peter Kurten?
DARYLL: Damn! I gave that to Conrad, too! That guy! I told Conrad deliver to Kurten and keep the 500 bucks in return for getting my book to you.
HELEN: How was Conrad supposed to find Kurten?
DARYLL: Conrad has the phone number. Conrad, where is he?
HELEN: In jail.
DARYLL: That Klutz. They send him back here, I'll kick his ass good.
