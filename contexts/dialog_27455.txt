DAFFY: You. You're the guy that lent me the money.
RICHARD: Yeah, that's right. Now could you be quiet so I can get some sleep.
DAFFY: Ten dollars. I'll find a way to pay you back. How would you like to know About somewhere special? The perfect beach. Paradise. No one else knows about it. That's got to be worth something. What do you say?
RICHARD: Look I don't care about the money right now: I just want some sleep. So if you could be quiet -
DAFFY: Yea, OK. I will be, I will be, I promise.
RICHARD: Thanks.
