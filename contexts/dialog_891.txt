CASSANDRA: Look, I don't know where Mr. Strader might be. He comes and he goes.
SYKES: The girl out front mentioned Strader's assistant, somebody named Watson. Maybe he knows.
CASSANDRA: Todd? Todd doesn't know either.
CASSANDRA: I know... Why don't you hang around for a while, let me entertain you? It's Matt, right? Now tell me the truth, have you ever... made it... with one of us?
SYKES: Not unless I got real drunk and nobody told me about it later.
CASSANDRA: A virgin. I find that very arousing...
SYKES: There's lots of things I haven't done, but his ain't high on the list. Don't take it personally.
CASSANDRA: I think you're just a little scared now, about what you might find once the lights go out. A little scared... and a lot curious. Maybe more than you want to admit. But doesn't that turn you on, that curiosity and fear, swirling together? Think of it as broadening your horizons.
SYKES: I like my horizons narrow.
CASSANDRA: Your voice is saying no, but your body is saying yes.
