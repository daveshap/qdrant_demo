How did you break into your first management job?
Healthcare specifically, but any advice from any field is appreciated!

I have been working in a hospital for 5 years in an allied health career. I’m extremely organized and self-sufficient. When there are workflow changes, or new software additions I always learn quickly and coworkers come to me for help. I get along with everyone but I’m not an extroverted person, and can’t play the office politics game very well. 

There is a girl who started the same year I did who already has a lead position by basically having the social skills to impress the director. She has the same education I do and one less certification than me. She is not respected by coworkers and people have to pick up her slack. How do people just *know* how to work the politics of a job?! 

I am craving more responsibility and don’t want to break into another industry and have to start over in my career. What bachelors degree would be best for me to obtain? I am considering an online healthcare management program. Are there are any other similar degrees that would be beneficial to advancing my career and augment my existing experience?

Right now none of the higher ups have advanced degrees. It’s like a big social club in management and they all moved up the ladder before degrees made much of a difference. Another concern I have is I am 26. What advice does anyone have for a young-ish person looking to break into administration? 

Thank you in advance!
