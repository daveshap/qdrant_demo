HELEN: I am not going to talk about it. How do you <u>know</u> it was Andy if the head was gone? Where is the head? Are you looking for it? Oh, God, why him? Because of me. I can't talk about it. I write about things like this, stuff it all in books and bury it in libraries. This is the first person close to me who's ever died. And it's because of me. This monster killed him because I loved him.
M.J.: I've got to go. I've <u>got</u> to go.
M.J.: How many do you need to sleep. Really sheep?
HELEN: W-We had a fight. I called him... called him a name...
M.J.: Christ, Helen. The first time, we're ahead of the son of a bitch! I can't leave you like this -- and there's no time. Knock yourself out.
