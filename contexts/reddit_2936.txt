How do you find a job when you have no job?
A lot of employees say it is easier to find a job when you are still currently employed. But I just lost my job. Now I have all the time in the world. And I'm scared.  I don't have the time to be waiting around for interviews to be handed to me. I'm not sure what to do in the meantime. Money is not a factor, but just waiting around, gets me anxious. And I don't even know if I have the experience. This is all so scary.
