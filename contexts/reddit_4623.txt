I just feel so disgusting
I feel like nobody will ever love me. I keep giving love but nothing comes back. I keep trying to find someone. Every guy that comes my way that I like ends up flirting with me and then revealing they have a gf or they’re catfishing me. I seem so hopeless and ugly. I feel just so bad. I just can’t win. I feel my heartbreaking everyday when I watch the one guy I truly love be with his girlfriend. I don’t even cry anymore because I know it does nothing but just make me feel even worse. I’m drifting away
