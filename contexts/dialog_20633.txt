NANCY: What are you doing?
PEGGY: I'm just happy to see you.
NANCY: Come on! Mom said you were sick. You're never happy to see me.
PEGGY: I'm sorry about that. I really want us to be closer. I have enough unresolved relationships in my... life.
NANCY: Teenagers are weird. And you're the weirdest.
PEGGY: Let's do something together.. Do you want to play Monopoly? Or Careers... Clue... Snakes and Ladders?
NANCY: Okay, what do you want? What dumb favor do you want me to do?
PEGGY: It's unbelievable. The man never ages.
NANCY: Look at Kenny Rossi. Isn't he dreamy? I wish he'd break up with Arlene. She thinks she's so great.
PEGGY: Don't eat the red ones.
NANCY: Why not? They're my favorite.
PEGGY: They're bad for you. They cause...red lips.
