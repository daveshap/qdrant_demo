I'm buying a car tomorrow!
I haven't owned a vehicle in over seven years. Tomorrow I'm buying a 99 Honda Accord for $1000. I'm so happy and excited I'm literally crying. I can't wait to tell my kids but I'm waiting until I actually have everything signed and in my hands to make the announcement! I've worked so hard for this. Last year I paid Jackson County over 2k to get my license back.
