Do you ever realize how easily you can exit someone's life?
It's so strange, in under a year I've come to realize how easy it is to slip out of someone's life no matter how much you cared for each other before. It's comforting to think that these people will be (are?) okay without me, so nothing will be "selfish" about my suicide.

edit: Thank you stranger for silver, & to everyone else who understands this. Every "you matter" and "you don't realize how much they care actually" is very kindhearted of you to say but untrue in my circumstance unfortunately.
