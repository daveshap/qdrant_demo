Can't get an Academic Advising position with a Masters?
I have a friend who has completed both her Bachelor's and Master's in higher education. It has been a year and still she has not been able to find a job even with her Master's degree regardless of landing some interviews! She was able to complete an internship in school as a requirement of graduation however is still viewed as under qualified compared to other candidates... Is there something I'm missing? Why is it so difficult to land a job in this field?
