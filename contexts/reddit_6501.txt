Why are people expected to work their way up in corporate jobs?
I've been working in service jobs for most of my life and there wasn't a concept of upward mobility. In my old workplace, my boss was upset with me because I didn't ask her for more opportunities. I wasn't aware I supposed to be asking for more work and I was happy with what I was doing. Is there a position or job in a white-collar environment where I can do what I signed up for and not have my task/title changed?
