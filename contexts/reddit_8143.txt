Over a fifth of American children live below the poverty line, a higher rate than comparable developed nations. What are the historical and present causes of this outlier, and what policies have been shown to be effective at improving the situation?
Recent estimates suggest that [over 20%](http://www.nccp.org/topics/childpoverty.html) of American children are currently living below the poverty line. While the current rate is [at the lowest it has ever been](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/10/child-poverty-rate-record-low/542058/), it remains one of the highest in the developed world. Notably, a much greater proportion of American children are in poverty compared to the general population: overall, [around 13% of Americans are in poverty](https://poverty.ucdavis.edu/faq/what-current-poverty-rate-united-states), by some measures. While measures of poverty differ, [one source](https://www.stjornarradid.is/media/velferdarraduneyti-media/media/1---formennska-2014/0930_Family_policy_TS.pdf) suggests that compared to an OECD average of about 11%, US child poverty is over 17%. 

Various proposals have long been put forward to resolve the matter. [Free childcare](https://www.brookings.edu/research/why-the-federal-government-should-subsidize-childcare-and-how-to-pay-for-it/) and [conditional transfers](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2013/nov/05/bolsa-familia-brazil-cash-transfer-system) have received a fair amount of attention, though both have been criticized for not tackling larger, structural or historical structures unique to the US.
