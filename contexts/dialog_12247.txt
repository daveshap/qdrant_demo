UNCLE VICTOR: Let's examine the facts on it. I say this country has been too harsh in its outright condemnation of war. I say you can point to many material advantages brought about by a crisis and conflict policy. Hell, World War II gave us the ballpoint pen. That's common knowledge.
HAROLD: During wartime the national suicide rate goes down.
UNCLE VICTOR: Is that a fact? Well, that fits in right along with everything I've been saying. War is not all black.
HAROLD: War is not all black.
UNCLE VICTOR: And so I ask you - why the hell did we give up on the Germans? Those damn politicians in Washington chalked them up on our side and the wars ever since have been a national disgrace. Hell, look at history. The two best wars this country has fought were against the Jerries. Now I say, get the Krauts on the other side of the fence where they belong, and let's get back to the kind of enemy worth killing and the kind of war this whole country can support.
HAROLD: Jeez, sir. That's pretty strong stuff.
