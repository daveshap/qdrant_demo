MARTIN: Well, we have one lead and that's what I'm looking into next.
BOOTH: What's that?
MARTIN: Denning was wearing a bug.
MARTIN: He kept a recording of all such transactions in order to keep track of who's who, what was said, what's happening. I contacted your local coroner, and he found it taped to his back.
DWAYNE: That's news to me. So it's over at Jesse's office?
MARTIN: Yeah. I told him I'd be there before five.
DWAYNE: Excellent. I'll go down with you.
