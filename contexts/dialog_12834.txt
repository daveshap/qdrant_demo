LOUIE: Anything you want, Boss.
BURNS: Beat it out and get hold of some guys.
LOUIE: Who do you want?
BURNS: Anybody with hair on his chest. Get 'em off the street -- anywhere. Offer them anything -- only get them. We've got to get this desk out of here.
LOUIE: You know me. The shirt off my back.
BURNS: You got plenty of money?
LOUIE: Sure, boss.
BURNS: I mean real money -- not counterfeit!
LOUIE: I always have both.
