MAGGIE: Your relatives must've taught you something.
RAY: NO. My father never told anybody he had Indian blood. But he still used a few Indian words around the house. He called me Washee. Said it meant... good boy.
RAY: What?
MAGGIE: Wa-shee is like... a dumpling. Like tallow we put in stew. I think he was calling you chubby boy.
RAY: Great.
