JACK: Hello again.
ROSE: Could I speak to you in private?
JACK: Uh, yes. Of course. After you.
JACK: So, you got a name by the way?
ROSE: Rose. Rose DeWitt Bukater.
JACK: That's quite a moniker. I may hafta get you to write that down.
ROSE: Mr. Dawson, I --
JACK: Jack.
ROSE: Jack... I feel like such an idiot. It took me all morning to get up the nerve to face you.
JACK: Well, here you are.
ROSE: Here I am. I... I want to thank you for what you did. Not just for... for pulling me back. But for your discretion.
JACK: You're welcome. Rose.
ROSE: Look, I know what you must be thinking! Poor little rich girl. What does she know about misery?
JACK: That's not what I was thinking. What I was thinking was... what could have happened to hurt this girl so much she though she had no way out.
ROSE: I don't... it wasn't just one thing. It was everything. It was them, it was their whole world. And I was trapped in it, like an insect in amber. I just had to get away... just run and run and run... and then I was at the back rail and there was no more ship... even the Titanic wasn't big enough. Not enough to get away from them. And before I'd really though about it, I was over the rail. I was so furious. I'll show them. They'll be sorry!
JACK: Uh huh. They'll be sorry. 'Course you'll be dead.
ROSE: Oh God, I am such an utter fool.
JACK: That penguin last night, is he one of them?
ROSE: Penguin? Oh, Cal! He is them.
JACK: Is he your boyfriend?
ROSE: Worse I'm afraid.
