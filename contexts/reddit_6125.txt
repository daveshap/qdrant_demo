21 year old graduating college, looking for online job
Hi everyone! I’m kinda new to this chat.

I’m a 21 year old Senior student that is graduating this semester with a degree in political science, I’m looking for possible online job opportunities that I could do during this state-wide quarantine. I want to be able to make extra money and get some work experience during the COVID-19 shutdown. Do any of you know a good place to look?
