How do you survive working at a start up without burning out?
I will be starting an exciting new entry-level job at a start up soon. It’s an amazing opportunity and I believe I am qualified for the job.

However, I’m a little nervous because I’ve never worked in a start up culture before. In your experience, is it any different from typical office politics?

What else should I expect aside from long hours and wearing “many hats”?

I just want to make sure I’m prepared and strategic so I can make the most of this adventure without mentally/emotionally/physically burning out.

Any tips or personal stories would be highly appreciated!
