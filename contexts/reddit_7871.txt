Has anyone done a non-systematic review as part of a thesis chapter for your Master's or PhD?
Has anyone done a non-systematic review such as a narrative review or a literature. I am thinking of doing this for one of the chapters of my Master's thesis and was wondering how you justified doing that as opposed to a systematic review (with quality evaluation, systematic search etc)? Thank you!
