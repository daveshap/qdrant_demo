Removing Gnome shell from Ubuntu 18.04 Desktop Long story short: I installed Ubuntu 18.04 Desktop on my home server (because Ubuntu server kept failing on install.) I configured Grub to load directly to command line. I would really like to uninstall GUI interface--make it lean and have less programs to update. If I uninstalled gnome, will that affect any other functionality? What's the best way to uninstall Gnome to avoid any unintended consequences?(I've reviewed a few other posts, but most seem to be about using Unity after uninstalling Gnome.)
