Unbalanced Longitudinal Multilevel Model Power Analysis I am trying to conduct a power analysis on a multilevel longitudinal model (pre-existing household panel dataset) and am having trouble figuring out how to do it (or if it is even needed in the first place, however I am assuming that I will be asked the question by reviewers if I do not include it). I am using R for all analysis (lme4 package) and would therefore prefer an R solution if possible (but it doesn\u2019t have to be).Below is a summary of the model.Outcome DVJob satisfaction measured over time (up to 10 time points)Level 1 (within-person) variables:TimePersonality trait 1Personality trait 2Personality trait 3Personality trait 4Personality trait 5Employment status (part-time or full-time, coded as 0 or 1)Monthly gross incomeLevel 2 (between-person) variables:Time (the between-person component of the level 1 variable)Personality trait 1 (the between-person component of the level 1variable)Personality trait 2 (the between-person component of thelevel 1 variable)Personality trait 3 (the between-person componentof the level 1 variable)Personality trait 4 (the between-personcomponent of the level 1 variable)Personality trait 5 (the between-person component of the level 1 variable) Employment status (the between-person component of the level 1 variable) Monthly gross income (the between-person component of the level 1 variable)GenderAverage ageCross-level interaction:Time (level 1) x Personality Trait 1 (level 2)The model has job satisfaction as its outcome variable where I am interested in modelling the growth in job satisfaction as a consequence of between-person (level 2) extraversion (hence the cross-level interaction). Individuals serve as the level two clusters (N = 7,275) and observations of time serve as the primary level one predictor (N = 23,974, unbalanced such that different individuals have different N observations). All other variables are covariates and for all time-varying covariates I have split them into their within-person and between-person components (hence the double-up at level 1 and level 2 for all variables but age and gender).Any help would be appreciated.
