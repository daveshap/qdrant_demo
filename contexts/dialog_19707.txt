NINOTCHKA: Guest?
BULJANOFF: We have opened a restaurant...
IRANOFF: ...we have a wonderful electric sign: Dine With Buljanof
NINOTCHKA: You mean you are deserting Russia?
KOPALSKI: Don't call it desertion. Our little restaurant... that is our Russia... the Russia of borscht, the Russia of beef Stroganoff, blinis with sour cream...
IRANOFF: ...the Russia of piroshki... people will eat and love it.
BULJANOFF: We are not only serving good food, we are serving our country... we are making friends.
NINOTCHKA: Who gave you this idea? What is responsible for all this?
KOPALSKI: There's something in Constantinople... something irresistible....
IRANOFF: ...it is in the air... it may come around the corner as you walk down the street....
BULJANOFF: ...it may step out of a bazaar... it may wait for you in a corridor... it may hide in the shadow of a minaret....
KOPALSKI: Right now it's on the balcony.
LEON: They wouldn't let me in so I had to get you out.
NINOTCHKA: So -- you're behind all this. I should have known.
LEON: Trying to keep me away from you! It couldn't be done. Naturally I couldn't go on forever punching passport officials in the nose -- but I found a way, didn't I? Darling, I had to see you. I wrote and wrote but all my letters came back.
NINOTCHKA: The one I got they wouldn't let me read. It began, Ninotchka
LEON: I won't tell you what came between... I'll prove it. It will take a long time, Ninotchka... at least a lifetime.
NINOTCHKA: But, Leon, I am only here for a few days.
LEON: If you don't stay with me, I'll have to continue my fight. I'll travel wherever Russian commissions are. I'll turn them all into Buljanoffs, Iranoffs, and Kopalskis. The world will be crowded with Russian restaurants. I'll depopulate Russia. Once you saved your country by going back. This time you can save it by staying here.
NINOTCHKA: Well, when it is a choice between my personal interest and the good of my country, how can I waver? No one shall say Ninotchka was a bad Russian.
