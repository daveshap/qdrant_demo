MAX: It's just not working like this. We gotta do something. It'd be one thing if these girls were hardened criminals, but Jesus, Hal, this is makin' us look bad. I don't know... maybe they're not movin'. Maybe that little creep lied.
HAL: He's got nothin' to gain by lyin'. Nothin' at all. He already got all their money. I just don't know what we're dealin' with here. Anyway, it went out again last night on Nationwide Teletype. Let's just wait it out a little longer. She said she was gonna call back. Let's just sit tight.
MAX: We don't have a whole lotta choice, do we? I can't figure out if they're real smart or just really, really lucky.
HAL: It don't matter. Brains will only get you so far and luck always runs out.
THELMA: Louise... are we still going to Mexico?
LOUISE: Yes.
LOUISE: Well, I figure if you take a state policeman, shoot up his car, take his gun and lock him in the trunk, it's best to just get on out of the state if you can.
THELMA: Just asking.
LOUISE: I don't want to see any more beef jerky. I mean the next beef jerky you hand me is going out the window. It's drivin' me crazy. The whole car smells like it.
THELMA: It's good. It's what the pioneers ate.
LOUISE: I don't care what the damn pioneers ate. You just keep that shit away from me, now I mean it.
LOUISE: And I don't want any more Wild Turkey, either. It's burning a hole in my stomach.
THELMA: Okay, okay... I've got some tequila. You want some tequila?
LOUISE: You do?
THELMA: Yeah, you want it?
LOUISE: Yeah.
