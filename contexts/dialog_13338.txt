GABRIELLE: Yeah? What?
NATHAN: Hi. It's Nathan.
GABRIELLE: Call you back. You bastard! What do you want?
NATHAN: I just want to talk.
GABRIELLE: We have nothing to say! You are a rotten bastard, that's what!
NATHAN: Please. Just one minute of your time.
GABRIELLE: Why? You've made your decision, Mister Stinky American! Now I hate you! No, I don't hate you; I don't even think about you!
NATHAN: I've got some things to tell you.
GABRIELLE: Like what?
NATHAN: Well, I think it would be easier if I could talk to you in person.
GABRIELLE: What for?
NATHAN: Well, I think...
GABRIELLE: You think too much. I need a man who doesn't think so much but acts more than he thinks... is what I need!
NATHAN: What?
GABRIELLE: You heard me! You make me sick when you pretend to not understand what I am saying to you! Go away from here!
NATHAN: Well, look, I'm sorry to have bothered you.
