Attachment
Sucks when you’re so attached to someone and you just can’t let go of the idea of how amazing it could’ve been with them.. but maybe it’s just not meant to be and both of you are just too different from each other. I’m drunk.





*edit* Holy shit I woke up to a bunch of notifications and realized I had posted something on here. Thank you for the kind messages everyone, I honestly feel better about everything now. I kinda feel sick from last night so I’ll reply to as many as I can later.
