HUEY: Alright, I'll stay. Judge, I want to...
TYRONE: Where you been? I saw the cops rousting you at the rally.
JUDGE: Aw... uh... it's was just harassment. My driver's license expired.
HUEY: Chickenshits, they're grabbing at anything.
HUEY: What's the pig's name?
JUDGE: Brimmer.
HUEY: You got to keep very cool on this. Icy god damn cool. Cause baby, you just became the strongest weapon we got. Let me guess, he wants you to call him, tell him what we're doing.
JUDGE: Yeah.
HUEY: And you're gonna do just that. But I'll tell you what to feed the pig. You alright with this?
JUDGE: Yeah... I guess. Any of other Panthers know about this?
JUDGE: Man, this shit's pretty thick.
HUEY: You got that right. And brother, I got a feeling it's going to get a whole lot thicker.
