ANGIE: You think I don't know? You think I like to keep this inside? But I gotta, or he'll kill the miserable bastard and he'll be there for life. It's disgusting what you have to put up with.
MICKEY: Look at Jeannie's kid.
ANGIE: What? What happened?
MICKEY: The oldest one. He was in an argument. A lousy ten-dollar card game. The kid pulls out a gun. It goes off. The kid gets killed. The grandmother hears it and finds out he's been arrested. She has a heart attack. She drops dead right on the spot. Now Jeannie's got a husband and son in jail and a mother in the funeral parlor.
ANGIE: But he was always a bad kid, that one.
MICKEY: No. Come on. It was the younger one that was the bad one.
