CHET: Hey!!!... Johnnie Farragut. How are you, my man.
JOHNNIE: Real good, Chet... It's been awhile.
CHET: Everythin's relative. Where's that Marietta Pace Fortune? You two didn't split up, I hope.
JOHNNIE: No... She's fine. Back home.
CHET: What'll it be? The regular? Black Label?
JOHNNIE: Set one up.
CHET: So who you out sleuthin' for now?... Can I help ya?
JOHNNIE: Actually, I'm lookin' for Marietta's daughter, Lula. Her and 'er beau took off the other day. Marietta's real upset about it.
CHET: Hell, that rings a bell. Someone told me somebody lookin' like her was at the Nothin' Fancy yesterday.
JOHNNIE: Sounds right... I'll check it out.
CHET: You hitched yet?
JOHNNIE: No sir...
CHET: It's none of my business, but when are you and Marietta gonna tie the knot? I always wondered why you never did.
JOHNNIE: Not for lack of love, I can tell ya that.
CHET: That's what I mean... Always looked like you was just knocked out in love... Was real nice to see.
JOHNNIE: I'll tell ya though, it's comin' up to the time when Marietta and me might just set up house together and settle down... I think that time's comin' up right soon. But like you said, everythin's relative.
LULA: Let's get outta here... I suddenly got a funny feelin' about this place. Feelin' all that voodoo...
SAILOR: Gotta hex from a voodoo?
LULA: Who do?
SAILOR: You do.
LULA: Oh my God... It's Johnnie... Duck down!... Get goin'!
SAILOR: Where?
LULA: Never mind where... Get outta here... I mean it, Sailor.
SAILOR: I'm goin'.
