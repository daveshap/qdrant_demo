CARTER: Now, that's American music.
LEE: Yes, I know this song.
CARTER: You know War?
LEE: Who does not know War? ³War, hhh, Wo-ooh-wo-ooh-wo-oh. What is it good for? Absolutely nothing. Good-God, you all.²
CARTER: That's not how it goes.
LEE: Yes, I think so.
CARTER: No, no. It's not good-God you all! It's Good-God, ya'll. Ya'll!
LEE: Yee-aww.
CARTER: Not yee-aw, Ya'll. And it's gotta be angry. Like you're pissed off.
LEE: Good God, ya'll!
CARTER: No! You hate me. Look, I'm gonna do it one time. That's it.
