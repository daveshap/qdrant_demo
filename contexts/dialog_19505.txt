PEARL HARPER: I'm hungry.
PREACHER: Why, sure. And there's fried chicken and candied sweets and cornsticks and apple cobbler!
PEARL HARPER: Can I have my supper please?
PREACHER: Naturally.
PEARL HARPER: Can I have milk too?
PREACHER: Yes. But first of all we'll have a little talk.
PREACHER: About our secrets.
PEARL HARPER: No.
PREACHER: Why, pray tell?
PEARL HARPER: Because John said I mustn't.
