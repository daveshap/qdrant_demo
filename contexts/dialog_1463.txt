KIMBALL: Anything else you can tell me about Owen?
BATEMAN: We were both seven in 1969.
KIMBALL: So was I.
BATEMAN: Do you have any witnesses or fingerprints?
KIMBALL: Well, there's a message on his answering machine saying he went to London.
BATEMAN: Well, maybe he did, huh?
KIMBALL: His girlfriend doesn't think so.
BATEMAN: But...has anyone seen him in London?
KIMBALL: Actually, yes.
BATEMAN: Hmmm.
KIMBALL: Well, I've had a hard time getting an actual verification. A Stephen Hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there, but I checked it out and what happened is, he mistook a Hubert Ainsworth for Paul, so...
BATEMAN: Oh.
KIMBALL: Was he involved at all , do you think, in occultism or Satan worship?
BATEMAN: What?
KIMBALL: I know it sounds like a lame question, but in New Jersey I know this sounds like a lame question, but last month-I don't know if you've heard about this, but a young stockbroker was recently arrested and charged with murdering a young Chicano girl and performing voodoo rituals with various body parts-
BATEMAN: Yikes! No. Paul wasn't into that. He followed a balanced diet and-
KIMBALL: Yeah, I know, and was into that whole Yale thing.
BATEMAN: Have you consulted a psychic?
KIMBALL: No.
BATEMAN: Had his apartment been burglarized?
KIMBALL: No, it actually hadn't. Toiletries were missing. A suit was gone. So was some luggage. That's it.
BATEMAN: I mean no one's dealing with the homicide squad yet or anything, right?
KIMBALL: No, not yet. As I said, we're not sure. But... basically no one has seen or heard anything.
BATEMAN: That's so typical, isn't it?
KIMBALL: It's just strange. One day someone's walking around, going to work, alive, and then...
BATEMAN: Nothing.
KIMBALL: People just...disappear.
BATEMAN: The earth just opens up and swallows people.
KIMBALL: Eerie. Really eerie.
BATEMAN: You'll have to excuse me. I have a lunch meeting with Cliff Huxtable at Four Seasons in twenty minutes.
KIMBALL: Isn't the Four Seasons a little far uptown? I mean aren't you going to be late?
BATEMAN: Uh, no. There's one...down here.
KIMBALL: Oh really? I didn't know that.
