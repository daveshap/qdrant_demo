What are the implications of the US backing out of UNESCO?
So[ by the end of 2018 the US will supposedly be withdrawn from UNESCO.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/10/12/u-s-withdraws-from-unesco-the-u-n-s-cultural-organization-citing-anti-israel-bias/?utm_term=.f49f89dda4cf)

I did some research [\(skimming the wiki\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO#Activities) into the organization and what they do, they seem like a generally benevolent force for advancing society and science with international cooperation in the hopes of contributing to peaceable relations. I can't find anything credible supporting the 
anti-Isreael bias cited in the first link aside from the admittance of Palestine in 2011 cited below.

In the wiki I found this:
> In 2011, Palestine became a UNESCO member following a vote in which 107 member states supported and 14 opposed.[39][40] Laws passed in the United States in 1990 and 1994 mean that it cannot contribute financially to any UN organisation that accepts Palestine as a full member.[41] As a result, it withdrew its funding which accounted for about 22% of UNESCO's budget.[42] Israel also reacted to Palestine's admittance to UNESCO by freezing Israel payments to the UNESCO and imposing sanctions to the Palestinian Authority,[43] claiming that Palestine's admittance would be detrimental "to potential peace talks".[44] Two years after they stopped paying their dues to UNESCO, US and Israel lost UNESCO voting rights in 2013 without losing the right to be elected (as a consequence, US was elected as a member of the Executive Board for the period 2016-2019).[45]

This appears to indicate that the US had already pulled funding from UNESCO during the Obama administration and lost voting rights.

What does it mean to pull out completely now and what will this directly affect?
