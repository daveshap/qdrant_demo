CLAUDE: Why do you think they call him Jangle Leg?
RAY: Somebody just told me he wins the three-legged race every year.
CLAUDE: So?
RAY: He does it all by himself.

RAY: Can't I get one of those steaks you got grilling back there?
COOKIE: Those are for trusties, unless you got thirty cents or two packs of cigs.
