Is there time-limit for Catholic Reformation? So, in my game now is Age of Absolutism. Protestant and Reform has yet to spawn since during the previous ages I have been then Catholic Defender of Faith and often the Curia Controller. The only other Catholic is Mongolia. Mongolia doesn't have Protestant appearing either.Now I have finally got rid of both Defender of Faith and Curia. However, even after 15-ish years the Protestant even has yet to show up. The reform desire is at >100.Do I need to wait for some more time? Or since it is already Age of Absolutism, is it already too late for Protestantism to show up?
