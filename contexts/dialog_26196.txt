SOOZE: You know, my mom has this saying.
PONY: Yeah?
SOOZE: Don't write any checks you can't cash.""
PONY: Really? What else does your mother say?
JEFF: Oh, hi. I thought you guys got lost.
SOOZE: Hey, where did you go? We were worried about you.
BEE-BEE: Uh, home, you know.
SOOZE: Yeah, I talked to your mom. I think I woke her up. I hope I didn't get you in trouble.
BEE-BEE: You didn't get me in trouble.
PONY: Hey, where's Erica?
JEFF: I don't know.
SOOZE: Gee, Jeff, I thought you were gonna go take a piss, not join some alcoholic nudist colony.
JEFF: No, no. I just got sick and tired of listening to that demo tape over and over again, you know? I mean, I felt like a fucking groupie, you know.
SOOZE: Mm. I enjoyed the ride. Sorry you didn't.
JEFF: But wait! Sooze, I don't wanna fight. I'm so sorry.
SOOZE: What?
JEFF: No, I mean it. No, look, when, when I got out of the car I walked all the way here.
SOOZE: Mm-hm.
JEFF: And I fig- and I figured something out.
SOOZE: Oh, yeah?
JEFF: I, yeah.
SOOZE: Mm.
BUFF: Hey! On behalf of Burnfield, I present to you the keys to the city.
TIM: So, how was the ride, kids?
BUFF: Great.
TIM: Really?
SOOZE: It was the nicest thin I've done in a long time.
TIM: Oh that's nice for you.
PONY: Where's Erica? You seen her?
TIM: Erica? She said she was tired. She went back to the hotel.
PONY: Oh, How'd she get back?
TIM: I called Bucky's. I got her a cab. Is there any hot mustard?
JEFF: I don't know.
PONY: I'm gonna go to the car for a 'sec. I'll be right back.
BUFF: They are old, we are young, they are fast, we are fun.
TIM: Buff, please, would you jus fuck off, okay? Fuck off!
JEFF: Wait, Sooze, I, I have to talk to you, 'cause I, there's something I figured out.
SOOZE: God, you smell like whiskey.
JEFF: No, no, I have to talk to you.
SOOZE: Is that a threat?
TIM: I ate a dog when I was in Thailand. Tasted exactly like this sparerib.
JEFF: No, wait, no, I thought about New York.
SOOZE: Forget about New York, Jeff. I don't want to talk about New York anymore.
TIM: There was this other place where they served live monkey brains. Sweat to God. You walk in, they bring the little monkey out, shave his head, crack it open, and you eat it's brains while it's still alive. I didn't go in, though, 'cause I didn't have any money and my mom has a saying: Don't write any checks you can't cash"."
JEFF: Tim, what are you talking about?
TIM: Ask your girlfriend.
PONY: Well, I called Erica's beeper. There's just no answer.
TIM: What are you? Her pimp? She said she might go get a drink first.
PONY: Well, I mean, she always answers her beeper.
TIM: Pal, she's a big girl, you know? I'm sure she's alright.
PONY: Yeah? Well, what'd she say?
TIM: About what?
PONY: About where she went. I mean, what bar?
TIM: She didn't say. Maybe she's at the bar at the hotel.
PONY: The bar at the hotel? She told you that? What did she say exactly?
TIM: Well, Dad, she said she wanted to suck my cock.
SOOZE: Tim, why don't you shut the fuck up?
PONY: I think I gotta go.
JEFF: See ya later.
TIM: What? Oh, come on. You're not gonna suck my cock?
