Love doesn't exist.
You came into my life out of nowhere. What started as little nothings became something life changing. I never expected you'd become my everything, and that I'd fall for you. I didn't expect for me to mean so much to you, or so I thought. I didn't expect for me to try again, to keep going. But you inspired me. 

But. Then again, you were always waiting for someone else, weren't you? Your best friend was right there, and it didn't matter how many hours we spent together. How much it seemed like I mattered to you or how much you mattered to me. It all ended right then and right there, the second he asked for it. The second he said it. 

Looks like I'll never actually be good enough. But hey, congratulations. You got me to believe I could be. Before you shat on my soul.

There's one thing I've learned in life. And that is that everything you want seems to fall right into your lap, and then poof, it's gone. You're even worse off than you were before it came into your life.
