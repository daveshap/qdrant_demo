JP: Welcome. 38
SANDY: You're JP Monroe, right?

JP: Thank you.
SANDY: Thank you for the drink. And the rose. Wow. That's ... really nice.
JP: It's yours. You won it. It's a prize.
SANDY: A prize? For what?
JP: You see, everyday I have my friend John here bring ...
SANDY: The barman? I thought he was called Rick?
JP: He's a barman. Whatever. Do you mind if I continue?
SANDY: I'm sorry.

JP: Don't do that! Don't put yourself down. If you have a quality, be proud of it...

SANDY: No. Really?
JP: Yes really.
SANDY: Wow. Thank you.
JP: No. Thank you.
