I worked 5 jobs last year. I made a total of 26k
My 2019 was consumed by side hustles I needed to supplement my below-living-wage PhD stipend while working on my dissertation. I had no social life, my relationship were strained because I was working all the time. Last night I imported the four W-2 forms and one 1099 form representing my 2019 income and my AGI was just over $26,000. I budget carefully and have been able to make ends meet, barely.  But now, reflecting back on last year, I'm really pissed off that I have worked SO hard and for so long and have little to show for it. I'm not even getting a tax refund because my non-compensatory income is more than my qualified educational expenses and one of my gigs was an IC job I still have to pay taxes on. I'm so sick of this, I've been below the poverty line for 6 years now despite having many skills and working my ass off.
