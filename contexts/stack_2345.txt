Unemployed duplicant still requiring high morale I have a duplicant in Oxygen Not Included that is suffering from stress because he requires a high morale due to his (former job). However, I removed him from that job, but he is still requiring high morale.Is the morale requirement permanent once you give a duplicant a job?
