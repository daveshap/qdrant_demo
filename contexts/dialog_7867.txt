ED: Excuse me, Mr. Lugosi??
BELA: I told you, I don't want any of your goddamn coffins.
ED: No. I don't work here.
BELA: Huh?
BELA: Who are you? What do you want?
ED: I don't want anything. I'm just a really big, big fan. I've seen all your movies.
BELA: Ha!
ED: Why were you buying a coffin?
BELA: Because I'm planning on dying soon.
ED: Really?
BELA: Yes. I'm embarking on another bus- and√≥truck tour of Dracula." Twelve cities in ten days
ED: You know, I saw you perform Dracula." In Poughkeepsie
BELA: Eh, that was a terrible production. Renfield was a drunk!
ED: I thought it was great. You were much scarier in real life than you were in the movie.
BELA: Thank you.
ED: I waited to get your autograph, but you never came outside.
BELA: I apologize. When I play Dracula, I put myself into a trance. It takes me much time to re-emerge.
BELA: Oh, there's my bus. Shit, where's my transfer?!
ED: Don't you bave a car?
BELA: I refuse to drive in this country. Too many madmen.
ED: Boy, Mr. Lugosi, you must lead such an exciting life. When is your next picture coming out?
BELA: I have no next picture.
ED: Ah, you gotta be jokin'! A great man like you... I'll bet you have dozens of 'em lined up.
BELA: Back in the old days, yes. But now -- no one give two fucks for Bela.
ED: But you're a big star!
BELA: No more. I haven't worked in four years. This town, it chews you up, then spits you out. I'm just an ex-bogeyman. Make a right.
BELA: They don't want the classic horror films anymore. Today, it's all giant bugs, giant spiders, giant grasshoppers -- who would believe such nonsense!
ED: The old ones were much spookier. They had castles, full moons...
BELA: They were <u>mythic</u>. They had a poetry to them. And you know what else? The women prefer the traditional monsters.
ED: The <u>women</u>?
BELA: The pure horror, it both repels and attracts them. Because in their collective unconsciousness, they have the agony of childbirth. The blood. The blood is horror.
ED: I never thought of that.
BELA: Take my word for it. You want to score" with a young lady
