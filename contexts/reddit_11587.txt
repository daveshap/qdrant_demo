It's my birthday :-|
I'm not a big birthday person, I don't like being the center of attention so always try to keep it super low key and small. My mom remembered as always, we are close. My dad forgot, sort of surprised, and pretty sure my brother has no clue, we haven't really talked in the past couple years, I text him for holidays and his birthday. 

The worst part is my girlfriend of almost six months is upset and not talking to me. As far as I can tell she is upset because I wasn't as excited about it as she thought I would be. I've told her I'm not really into birthdays and I didn't want a party, just a nice dinner was good, which we did. we got home and she went to bed way earlier then we ever do and had no desire to cuddle up so here I am sitting on the couch watching tv with her flat mate. 

Don't know why I'm not a fan of my birthday but from what I can remember I've never really been into it. I'll talk to her tomorrow I guess and hopefully figure out what's going on. 

Time to try to clear my head and get some sleep. Nighty night Reddit
