FRENCH VOICE: Good evening. Did you have a pleasant day today?
NEVILLE: Busy. I went swimming and prepared a new vehicle. A big vehicle.
FRENCH VOICE: That sounds charming. Did you meet any interesting people today?
NEVILLE: Yesterday. They're back. Haven't seen them for a few months. I have to be careful.
FRENCH VOICE: Tell me about the interesting people you met, won't you?
NEVILLE: They are... sinister. They want to kill me.
FRENCH VOICE: That sounds charming. What are you planning to do tomorrow?
NEVILLE: Stay alive.
