GROCER: See ye got two more peeps to your brood.
RACHEL COOPER: Yeah, and ornerier than the rest.
GROCER: How's your own boy, Miz Cooper?
RACHEL COOPER: Ain't heard from Ralph since last Christmas. Don't matter -- I've got a new crop. I'm a strong tree with branches for many birds. I'm good for something in this old world and I know it, too! We know that she will rout the Devil.
GROCER: Got a good buy in soap, Miz Cooper.
RACHEL COOPER: Don't need no soap. I'm boilin' down the fat from my hog.
