Replace application's AppArmor profile without process restart I'm using AppArmor in complain mode for a process in our production environment and I see some false positive profile violations in my logs. I'd like to roll out an updated profile but I cannot restart the process. Is there any way to replace an AppArmor profile without restarting the confined process? How to make sure that the profile has been correctly replaced?
