I suck at my new job
I work two days a week at a grocery store in the deli section (cheese shop). My first day was June 25, but I'm still struggling.  I work the morning shift at 8:00, so I'm supposed to check the sell by dates of stuff in the cooler and refrigerator section. I've been trying really hard to be thorough when checking dates ( I'm supposed to done by 10 but I've gone over that time). I'm still missing stuff that supposed to be pulled. I try to jot down on a small note book things that are going out of sale soon but my list isn't long enough ( before I was writing things that were going out sale in the first few days of the week) My cutting and wrapping is still too slow. I'm not learning about the cheeses fast enough. Last Monday I was there by myself until 12 (this was the first time) and I was really struggling. It took forever to find to find the cheese I was supposed to cut. I  ended cutting the wrong thing. I didn't have a sample set out. Anxiety was really kicking in at that point because certain cheeses go well with a preserve topping and others don't. I wasn't sure what to pick and over thought the whole thing because I was worried about making another mistake. I delayed my lunch break and tried to cut as much possible to not leave my co-worker with a lot to cut, but still I didn't cut enough. Technically, I'm on my second warning before my boss has to talk to management. I'm trying so hard but I can *feel* myself sucking and struggling. I try to ask for help when I need it but I'm not improving fast enough.
