RACHEL: You should not bother with that birdhouse. If you're leaving tomorrow.
BOOK: I'm leaving tonight. I'm going to need my clothes. And my gun.
RACHEL: There was a time when I thought you might have stayed.
BOOK: There was.
RACHEL: There was a time when I would have welcomed it.
BOOK: I know.
RACHEL: I was being foolish?
BOOK: No. I was being unrealistic. Even thinking about living this life.
RACHEL: You're so sure of that?
BOOK: Aren't you? After today?
RACHEL: I'm not so sure of anything as you are, John Book. You could live this life if you wanted to bad enough. Just as I could live yours!
BOOK: Oh, come on, Rachel. No way.
RACHEL: There is always a way! But you are such a... a Glotzkopp you cannot see! You'd rather go back to that city! To nothing! No woman! No children! No land!
BOOK: Land! Are you crazy? I'm no Amishman and I'm no farmer! I'm a cop. That's what I know and that's what I do!
RACHEL: What you do is take vengeance! Which is a sin against heaven!
BOOK: That's your way, not mine.
RACHEL: That's God's way!
BOOK: Well in the City of Philadelphia, God needs a little help!
