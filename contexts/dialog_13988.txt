LINDA: What's the story on Jimmy Gardner?
PRINCIPAL: Gardner? Oh, um -- he's a new student. Just moved here. Why?
LINDA: His teacher brought him in to see me. Said he'd been acting up in class. Creating a disturbance. I couldn't get a thing out of him.
PRINCIPAL: Oh?
LINDA: What's his family background?
PRINCIPAL: They're from out of state. Father's an engineer at the nuclear power plant. I really don't know much about them.
