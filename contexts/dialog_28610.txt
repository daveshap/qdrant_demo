BOBBY: Goddamn Stevenson. Jesus. Peace at any price. You'd think nobody learned anything from World War Two.
THE PRESIDENT: Somebody had to say it. I respect Adlai for having the guts to risk looking like an appeaser.
BOBBY: We have to pull him. He's not going to be able to handle the Soviets in front of the U.N. Zorin will eat him alive.
THE PRESIDENT: We've got bigger problems right now.
KENNY: We have to try the blockades. It probably won't work. It may just be delaying the inevitable. But we can't just go to war without trying not to.
THE PRESIDENT: I don't know. I don't know.
