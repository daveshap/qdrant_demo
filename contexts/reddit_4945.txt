I’m there for my friends whenever they need help, no one is there for me when I need it
Recently a few of my friends have been hit with some form of depression, whether it’s been going on for a long time, sometimes it was more serious than other but no matter how big or small I was there for them. This has been going on for about two months.

Helping them has distracted me from how shitty my life has been the past few years, but now that I need help they all look the other way. I’ve been posting on Snapchat asking someone to talk to me they ignore it, said that I feel upset about something and they will send me a message with no effort behind it, I have always messaged them when they need someone to talk to.

They know what’s been going on in my life too, I just broke up with my girlfriend of two years and after a few months we tried to give it another go, one thing lead to another and she’s given me an STD when I haven’t even looked at another girl since. They don’t know about the std but they know how upset I am over her and they all act dumb towards it. I feel so stupid :(

Tl;dr I help my friends when they needed it, I recently started needing a bit of help and they don’t even try.
