ROB: C'mon. I want to know.
LAURA: Want to know what, exactly?
ROB: What it was like.
LAURA: It was like sex. What else could it be like?
ROB: Was it like good sex or was it like bad sex?
LAURA: What's the difference?
ROB: You know the difference.
LAURA: Look, we're okay now. We just had a nice time. Let's leave it at that.
ROB: Okay, that's cool, okay. But the nice time we just had... was it nicer, as nice, or less nice than the nice times you were having a couple of weeks ago?
ROB: Oh, c'mon, Laura. Just say something. Lie, if you want. It'd stop me asking you questions and it'd make me feel better.
LAURA: Well I was gonna lie and now I can't, because you'd know I was lying.
ROB: Well why the fuck would you want to lie, anyway?
LAURA: To make you feel better.
ROB: Oh, great...
LAURA: Look, Rob. If great sex was as important as you think it is, and if I was having great sex with him, then we wouldn't be lying here now. And that is my last word on the subject, okay?
ROB: Okay.
