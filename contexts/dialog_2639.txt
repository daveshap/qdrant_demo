DUNWITTY: That's a great handle.
DELACROIX: Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat. Two real coons. I know we're way out there but it's satire.
DUNWITTY: I want you take it there. All the way to the edge and back.
DELACROIX: Every week we follow the trials and tribulations of two real coons - Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat. The Dusky Duo.
DUNWITTY: What are there character traits?
DELACROIX: Ignorant, dullwitted, lazy, and unlucky.
DUNWITTY: Exactly!
DELACROIX: Mantan is an uneducated Negro who always by some stroke of unbelievable stupidity makes his best laid plans go haywire.
DUNWITTY: And Sleep 'n Eat is his comical sidekick?
DELACROIX: Yep, you guessed it.
DUNWITTY: This could be bigger than Amos and Andy.""
DELACROIX: Protest finally forced Amos and Andy" off the air. Could stop us from ever getting on."
DUNWITTY: Let'em try. I will kill to make this happen.
DELACROIX: Negroes would be in an uproar.
DUNWITTY: So what. We would just give the NAACP a donation that would be the end of that. No such thing as bad publicity. So what. Earlier you said singing and dancing.
DELACROIX: Mantan right here is a gifted hoofer. He has educated feet.
DUNWITTY: Who are the other characters?
DELACROIX: Do we have characters? How about Honeycutt, Snowflake, Rastus, Nigger, Jim, Sambo, Jungle Bunny, and how could we forget Aunt Jemima.
DUNWITTY: We gonna hit 'em wid da BOMB DICKEY on dis' one. What's the setting?
DELACROIX: In the projects. Like Eddie Murphy's The PJ's.""
DUNWITTY: Ya first bad move. Projects been done. That's one of the problems now, everything, movies, TV, are set in the urban jungle, da hood. That's so tired. Mantan's Millennium Minstrel Show should be set on a plantation. In Alabama.
DUNWITTY: And every week these Alabama porch monkeys will make us cry, make us laugh, make us look at our own humanity. Make us feel good to be alive.
DELACROIX: I don't know about that plantation angle.
DUNWITTY: What are you talkin' 'bout? It's the move. Stay wid me now. We're movin' fast. What does everybody else think about this?
