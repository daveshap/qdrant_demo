LEONARD: I don't know. I'm sorry.
NATALIE: You have no idea where you've just come from? What you've just done?
LEONARD: I can't make new memories. Everything			 * fades, nothing sticks. By the time we finish this conversation I won't remember how it started, and the next time I see you I won't know that I've ever met you before.
NATALIE: So why did you come here?
