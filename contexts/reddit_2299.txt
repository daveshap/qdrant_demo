I did not do a single college app
I have almost 4.0 gpa and have a lot of extra curriculars. Because of my situation, I can only afford community college because I have to work.

Good luck to all of you to your dream schools. Please do good because I cannot. :(

Simple advice. The fact that you HAVE the option to do your college app is amazing. You should be thankful. You may not get to your dream school but at least thank your parents for raising you well enough to have that opportunity. :D
