Is it right to model a binary response variable on a set of variables, where one of the explanatory variables is assumed dependent on the others? I am modeling the binary variable Y on a set of variables, say the vector X, using logistic regression. Then, I want to model another binary variable, Z, again on vector X plus Y. Is this theoretically right (since Y is assumed dependent on X)? I know one alternative approach is using a bivariate logistic regression, with Y and Z as the response variables, but I basically cannot do that, because it just makes sense to model Z on a subset of the data, not the whole data, while Y needs to use the whole data.
