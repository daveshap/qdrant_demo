ALEX: What's been holding me together is the hope that maybe you do go someplace. And I'll be seeing her again soon. Only what will I say? That I was too stupid to find the guy who killed her? That he's down here laughing?
WALSH: Tell her... we'll get him.
ALEX: We won't.
WALSH: Someday he'll surface and I'll get him for both of you. I promise. I'll find the guy with the scar.
