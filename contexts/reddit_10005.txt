Opinions on ACUHO-I?
I just got an internship at the home office for Acuho-I, and I've been wondering how ACUHO-I is viewed? My boss makes it seem as though ACUHO-I is a huge organization and very involved, but until I applied I hadn't heard about it, even though I had lived in dorms. o what is the typical consesus?
