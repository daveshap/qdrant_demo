What is a helpful way to approach letting my new boss know I have completed grad coursework that I did not include on my resume?
Hi all, 

I recently accepted an offer of employment to work for a new org and am very excited to start my work. When I applied for the job, I did not include the graduate coursework that I've completed on my resume (I'm enrolled part-time in a grad program but do not yet have a degree). My reasons for leaving this coursework off were a) I don't have the degree yet, b) I wanted to keep my resume concise and focused on the job at hand (I have in the past been routinely guilty of including a lot of irrelevant info on my resume for the sake of "painting a complete portrait of myself"), and c) while the degree is applicable in the general field I'm working in it doesn't really have much bearing on the job I've been hired for. 

At no point in the hiring process was there an opportunity to bring it up, because again, the degree has no relevance to the particular job I was hired for. The intent was simply to not take credit for something I haven't earned yet, because until I finish my coursework, as far as I'm concerned it's just continuing education. 

I don't anticipate the class I have scheduled this fall to interfere with my work at all (I've been working f/t and studying p/t for a while now and it's always been fine), and won't be requesting professional development funds for my class as it doesn't have bearing on my job (I already paid off the course and plan on using my PD money for job-related tasks). I thought it might be helpful to let my boss know in case an opportunity for a promotion comes up in the future.

What do you think is the best way to approach this?
