Institution Type Pay
Hello all student affairs professionals 

I am currently a grad student in a SA program. I just begin my program a few weeks ago, but I am already thinking about jobs. I know that this field typically does not pay big bucks for entry level or mid level jobs, but I was wondering what institution type tends to pay the most. For example, do community college jobs pay more? Do big universities pay more? .. etc. Similarly, is there an areas of student affairs that tends to pay a little more than others? Any personal experience from people working in this field would be greatly appreciated :) 

Again, I know this is not a high paying field, but I would just like a better understanding of how pay works in this field
