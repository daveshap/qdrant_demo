ELIZABETH: Is your room just down the hall? ... in case I get frightened during the night?
FREDDY: Yes, but... I thought, perhaps tonight, under the circumstances, I might... stay here with you.
ELIZABETH: Oh, darling! Don't let's spoil everything.
FREDDY: I don't want to spoil anything -- I just want to top it all off.
ELIZABETH: Would you want me, now, like this, so soon before our wedding? ... So near we can almost touch it? Or wait a little while longer, when I can give myself without hesitation?... When I can be totally and unashamedly yours??
FREDDY: That's a tough choice.
ELIZABETH: Is it worth taking a chance?
FREDDY: I suppose you're right.
ELIZABETH: Of course I am. Now give me a kiss and say good night like my good boy.
FREDDY: Good night.
ELIZABETH: That's my good boy.
