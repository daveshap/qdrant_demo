Dealing with conflict
I guess the flair is correct.
I am a graduate student at an evolutionary genetics lab that works with flies. As any live animal we need to take care of the flies so we try to recruit undergrads for general lab maintenance and fly husbandry, in addition to those duties, from the large scale crosses we generate a lot of data with phenotyping under the microscope. They also help with data entry which includes entering all of the phenotyping information in excel. 
Sorry for the long intro but it's important for the context. 
So new volunteer students training is a big deal. There are two grad students who are responsible for training undergrads. 


My question is how should I approach a new student dealing with a conflict? 


Today I approached a student who was late for data entry with the excuse I didn't know it was for me as you didn't adress it by name plus also didn't return her biosafety training even though repeatedly reminded her (which is the only way we can let them in the lab. So it was also a safety issue.). 
I was frustrated and upset with this student so I asked to return those things if she wants to show us that she is willing to work in the lab. The language is apparently very negative because I was fed up. But I let my advisor know by including her in the loop. However, she did handle the situation in a completely different manner than mine which undermines whatever I stated. 

I believe that we should be communicating our issues and I should be able to tell the student if I am not happy with her work. As the graduate student we are dealing with the research in the lab.

I am now aware my attitude is all wrong I am second year graduate student that needs to learn how to approach to these things. But I was wondering if you had similar issues or know nuances as to deal with a conflict.
