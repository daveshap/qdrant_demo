HAGEN: Hello?
SANDRA: She's gone, Tom.
HAGEN: What do you mean gone?
SANDRA: The Barretts from Rubicon Bay came by in a new speedboat. Rocco tried to say she wasn't in, but Kay spotted them and asked if they would take her and the kids for a ride. That was three hours ago.
HAGEN: Why didn't someone tell me!
SANDRA: I wanted to tell you alone; your wife doesn't know what's going on.
