How big of a fire do I need to create a hurricane? So I know that Fire Tornadoes are a thing, however would you be able to create a hurricane using the firebending powers from the TV series Avatar the Last Airbender?For those of you who are unfamiliar with the Avatar Series, Firebending is basically pyromancy. Offensive moves like punches and kicks generate blasts/balls of fire. These fires can also be maintained and controlled by the firebender and an associated set of martial arts related moves.So I'm wondering if it would be possible for an army of firebenders to create a hurricane the size of Katrina, by creating many large fires, generating pillars of hot rising air which then cools, While more cold air is sucked in by the displaced hot air, eventually forming into a hurricane. How large or how much area would the fire need to cover?*I'm not sure if this part matters, but the firebenders will be at the north pole and so the weather conditions can be raining, snowing or huge rain clouds but not raining yet.Updates: I just wanted to add some updates/adjustments to clarify what I've mentioned in comments and provide more background informationIn the world of avatar, the direct manipulation of elements is often very hand wavy and focuses more on believable than physically possible (like where do they get all the energy). However the indirect manipulation of elements follows the laws of physics. So an Airbender could lift a rock by generating a large enough gust of wind and controlling the  wind around the rock, or shoot a rock by forcing air to rush through a narrow tube with the rock in it, however they can't lift the rock by creating a cushion of air around it.Firebenders are immune to fire (not in line with the avatar world, but allows them not to fry their friend next to them)The North Pole is the home of the Northern Water Tribe. They live in a city made of Ice (since they are water benders).
