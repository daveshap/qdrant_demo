White screen when installing OSX My daughter's MBP recently had a hard drive failure. I replaced the hard drive and purchased the Snow Leopard install disc from Apple.During the install start up, at a certain point the screen goes white and after a bit the fans go to a high speed. It then sits there running hot until it is powered down.Things I have tried:With a Crucial MX300 SSD (525GB, SATA III) installed:Install using the Snow Leopard disc Install using Yosemite on USB thumb drive (from App Store)Install using High Sierra on USB thumb drive (from App Store)Install using Internet Recovery (Command\u2014Option\u2014R)With a HGST Travelstar 7K1000 (1TB, SATA III) installed:Install using Yosemite on USB thumb drive (from App Store)Install using Internet Recovery (Command\u2014Option\u2014R)Original System DetailsMacBook Pro (15-inch, Early 2011)2.0 GHz Intel Core i7 (Sandy Bridge) 2635QM8GB RAM500 GB, 5400 RPM Hitachi HD10.6.6 Snow LeopardOther notesBooting in verbose mode (Command-V) shows various messages before the white screen depending on which install version is used.The extended version of the hardware test over internet (Option\u2014D) reports no issues.The MBP was working fine before the hard drive failure.I am pretty much out of ideas.
