BUD: Jesus, Lindsey--
LINDSEY: Bud, something really important is happening here.
BUD: Look. I'm just trying to hold this situation together. I can't allow you to cause this kind of hysteria--
LINDSEY: Who's hysterical? Nobody's hysterical!
BUD: All I'm saying is when you're hanging on by your fingernails, you don't go waving you arms around.
LINDSEY: I saw something! I'm not going to go back there and say I didn't see it when I did. I'm sorry.
BUD: God, you are the most stubborn woman I ever knew.
LINDSEY: I need you to believe me, Bud. Look at me. Do I seem stressed out? Any of the symptoms of pressure sickness, any tremors, slurred speech?
BUD: No.
LINDSEY: Bud, this is me, Lindsey. Okay? You know me better than anybody in the world. Now watch my lips... I saw these things. I touched one of them. And it wasn't some clunky steel can like we would build... it glided. It was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
LINDSEY: It was a machine, but it seems almost alive. Like a... dance of light. Bud, you have to trust me... please. I don't think they mean us harm. I don't know how I know that, it's just a feeling.
BUD: How can I go on a feeling? You think Coffey's going to go on you 'feeling'?
LINDSEY: We all see what we want to see... Coffey looks and he sees Russians, he sees hate and fear. Bud, you have to look with better eyes than that.
