CATHERINE: I should have known. I came into the house when you were down on the beach. She looked at me so strangely. She left right after you. I shouldn't have let her watch us. She wanted to watch me all the time. She tried to kill you, didn't she?
NICK: Did you like her to watch?
CATHERINE: Do you think I told her to kill You?
NICK: No.
CATHERINE: Everybody that I care about dies.
NICK: It's OK. It's OK.
CATHERINE: Make love to me.
NICK: Do you think she killed Johnny Boz?
CATHERINE: For what... to set me up? She loved me she wouldn't frame me.
NICK: Maybe she got jealous of Johnny Boz, too.
CATHERINE: No, she didn't... she never got jealous before... she got excited. I don't have luck with women. There was this girl I met while I was in college. I slept with her once. She started following me around, taking my picture. She dyed her hair, copied my clothes. Lisa something... Oberman. It was awful.
NICK: I thought you didn't do adolescent secrets.
CATHERINE: I never have before.
