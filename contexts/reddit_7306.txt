How do I get trained for the job that I want?
So I've been working at a law firm as a receptionist for the past 7 months now. It's been great, but when I started I was told there was a potential for growth as a paralegal. I was excited, knowing that being a paralegal could mean a better pay.

But honestly, I've learned that I'd much rather stay in the office management side of things, rather than being a paralegal.

I've been being trained in anything they can teach me to do, mainly because I pick things up quickly and I want to learn anything and everything I can to better myself and my resume.

They've given me some tasks that have me work with one of the paralegals, but some are done with the office assistant. She's on top of her work for the most part (from what can I see), but she's getting up in age. She is well past retiring age, but she'll probably work until she literally can't anymore. I'd be more happy to help her with more office upkeep work than to be a paralegal. 

So my question is, how can I steer my training towards office work and less towards being a paralegal, if at all?
