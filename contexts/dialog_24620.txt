MIKE: Claire?
CLAIRE: Hmm...
MIKE: You wouldn't happen to know what language they speak in India, do you?
CLAIRE: Urdu and Hindi.
MIKE: Yeah, what a woman.
CLAIRE: Didn't do very well, did you?
MIKE: Nope... never finished one yet. I hate these things.
CLAIRE: You were reading my Renoir.
MIKE: How did you know?
CLAIRE: You put it back in the wrong place... Do you like Renoir?
MIKE: They're kind of fuzzy.
CLAIRE: You know why they're like that...? He was myopic... going blind.
MIKE: No kidding.
CLAIRE: So, this could be your last night, huh?
MIKE: Could be, I guess.
CLAIRE: Want to go out for a drink? I mean, we're both sitting here, and Joey Venza's in jail...
MIKE: Yeah, I like that! Where you go, I follow.
CLAIRE: You mean to tell me, a mugger would stay away from someone because they walked a certain way?
MIKE: Absolutely. Look at this.
CLAIRE: That's the dumbest walk I ever saw!
MIKE: No, no seriously! There's a study done on this, you walk this way, the muggers are gonna single you out.
CLAIRE: And die laughing, because you're walking so stupid!
MIKE: Hey. This is my business. Do I tell you your business.
CLAIRE: Okay. Let's just see if a mugger gets me.
MIKE: ... It was like... the minute I saw her... I knew. She looked so damn adorable in a cop's uniform... puttin' on a big, tough act...
CLAIRE: So it was love"."
MIKE: Yeah. It was.
CLAIRE: And is"...?"
MIKE: Yeah.
CLAIRE: That's nice. And you live in Queens? With a child, and a dog...?
MIKE: No dog.
CLAIRE: I saw you with a dog, in my mind.
MIKE: No dog.
CLAIRE: But nice"."
MIKE: Very nice.
MIKE: What about Neil?
CLAIRE: You don't like him, do you?
MIKE: What's to like?
CLAIRE: Tell it like it is.
MIKE: You asked.
CLAIRE: He's very caring, in his way. You haven't seen him at his best.
MIKE: You could do better.
CLAIRE: I'll miss you, Mike...
CLAIRE: It was nice having you watch over me"..."
MIKE: Yeah. I liked being around you too... Claire.
