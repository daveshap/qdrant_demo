How to find Ultimecia Castle I was playing Final Fantasy VIII ages ago, and I had to stop for a while (technical difficulties, and real life preventing me taking the time to solve them). It's been several years at least, but I recently picked up my old save again. Unfortunately, I'm not sure how to progress. The save says I'm still on disc 3, but there's nothing left to do. I have Ragnarok, I have all GF's except Eden, I have everyone's best weapon, I've farmed four sets of all magic except Ultima (I was farming the Elnoyle in Esthar city when last I played), and most early locations don't have anything left. I've been back to Tear's Point, Trabia Garden, Fisherman's Horizon, Shimi Village, Lunatic Pandora Laboratory, Lunar Gate, and Esthar City, among others, and it seems like I've accomplished everything. I've also been back to the orphanage. I cannot get to the lighthouse. Cid and Edea are both there, and Edea admonishes me to be patient with Rinoa.I have read ahead some to try to figure this out on my own. It seems like maybe I should enter the obelisk floating above Tear's Point, but I can't see find how to do that, and it feels like I've played that sequence before.I also have vague memories of seeing and climbing the chains leading into the castle. I wonder that I have done that and then taken a portal out of the castle... but if so, how do I re-enter? And why does my save game say \"Disc 3\"?Any help appreciated.
