HARRY: Karen, say hello to Chili Palmer. Chili, this is Karen Flores.
CHILI: Karen, it's a pleasure. How you doing?
KAREN: How did you get in the house?
HARRY: He's telling me an idea for a movie. It's not bad so far. Sit down, have a drink. Tell Karen, let's see what she thinks.
KAREN: Maybe you didn't hear me.
CHILI: The door from the patio, in back.
KAREN: You broke in?
CHILI: No, it was open. It wasn't locked.
KAREN: What if it was?
HARRY: You want to hear this idea? It's about a dry cleaner who scams an airline out of three hundred grand. Go on, tell her.
CHILI: You just did.
HARRY: I mean, the way you told it to me. Start at the beginning, we see how the story line develops.
CHILI: Well, basically, this guy owes a shylock fifteen thousand, plus he's a few weeks behind on the vig, the interest you have to pay.
KAREN: I know what a vig is.
HARRY: It's the kind of situation, you don't pay, you get your legs broken.
CHILI: Or the guy thinks he could get 'em broken. You have to understand the loan shark's in business the same as anybody else. He isn't in it to hurt people. He's in it to make money.
