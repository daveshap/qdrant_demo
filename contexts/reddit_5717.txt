How long does an unpaid leave of absence last in NY?
So back in March last year, I got a new job, and voluntarily left my old job (I did not quit nor was I fired, I was put on a leave of absence). However, I was let go from the new job a few weeks ago, and I started to collect unemployment.

I figured since I was gone from my old job for about 10 months, it would be classified as job abandonment. (Everywhere I look it says leave of absence only lasts 12 weeks) I spoke to my old boss and she claimed I was still employed and on the payroll, is this possible?

Now I am worried because the department of labor is requesting additional info from me regarding my claim (not sure what, they won't return my calls). Can anyone help me figure this out?
