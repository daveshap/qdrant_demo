MORPHEUS: Get some rest. You're going to need it.
NEO: For what?
MORPHEUS: Your training.
TANK: Morning. Did you sleep?
NEO: No.
TANK: You will tonight. I guarantee it. I'm Tank. I'll be your operator.
NEO: You don't have...
TANK: Any holes? Nope. Me and my brother Dozer, we are 100 percent pure, old- fashioned, home-grown human. Born free. Right here in the real world. Genuine child of Zion.
NEO: Zion?
TANK: If this war ended tomorrow, Zion is where the party would be.
NEO: It's a city?
TANK: The last human city. The only place we got left.
NEO: Where is it?
TANK: Deep underground. Near the earth's core, where it's still warm. You live long enough, you might even see it.
