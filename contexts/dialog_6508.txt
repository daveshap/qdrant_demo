ANDY: What? What'd I do?
HELEN: Reminded me that I used to be attractive. That men used to want me...
ANDY: You <u>slut</u>! No sexy young cop for you unless you shampoo your hair.
ANDY: When are you going to call them?
HELEN: About what?
HELEN: I can't, Andy.
ANDY: Then, why don't you just die. I'm going. They'll find your body years later, the old recluse lady, she ate cat food, ten years of the New York Times, unread, piled on top of the unread mail, the TV still on. Make up your mind. Live or die. I'll get coffee.
