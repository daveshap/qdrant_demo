SAM: What if I couldn't get to you?
JONAH: I was scared of what you were gonna do.
SAM: When I found you?
JONAH: If I didn't go.
SAM: Listen, have I ever done anything really stupid?
JONAH: No.
SAM: I mean, so far, have I screwed it up for you?
JONAH: No.
SAM: I can't believe you flew first class.
JONAH: It was all they had.
ANNIE: I don't know what to say about it, Walter. It was a form of temporary insanity. But I had to tell you about it because --
WALTER: -- it was a betrayal.
ANNIE: Yes. But it wasn't really. It was just...
WALTER: So what happened?
ANNIE: I told you. Nothing --
WALTER: At the top of the Empire State Building --
ANNIE: I'm not at the top of the Empire State Building. I'm here.
WALTER: Not really. Look, Annie, I love you. Let's leave that out of it. I don't want to be someone you're settling for. I don't want to be someone anyone settles for. I have a life insurance policy, I'm fully invested in growth stocks, I have a paid subscription to Home Rox Office, I have no sexual diseases, I have been steadily employed in a part of the economy that isn't soft, I have expectation in the way of inherited wealth, I dress nicely, I am a member of the private sector, an independent voter, I don't watch Monday Night Football, the only thing wrong with me is that I am allergic to wheat, strawberries, penicillin, pollen, nuts and wool. There are plenty of women who see me as the brass ring. If you don't -- marriage is hard enough without bringing such low expectations into it, isn't it?
ANNIE: Oh, Walter. I don't deserve you.
WALTER: I think that's what I'm saying.
ANNIE: You okay?
WALTER: Yes. Some people will do anything to get out of going to a symphony.
ANNIE: Oh!
WALTER: What?
ANNIE: Look!
