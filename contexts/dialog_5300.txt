GINGER: Tell me.
NICKY: I know it wasn't a nice thing to do but -
GINGER: Yeah, no shit.
NICKY: Well, you gotta understand it. He doesn't know if this guy is shaking you down or taking advantage of you.
GINGER: No! No! I told him all about the guy before we ever got married. This is no fuckin' surprise.
NICKY: Oh, you did? I didn't know that.
GINGER: Yeah. He's just a friend of mine I was trying to help, so... so what?
NICKY: You know... the first time I ever saw your guys together... I never saw him so happy. I mean, I know he's a crazy Jew fuck and everything, but...
NICKY: I never see - You know, I never seen him act like that with anybody else. I think he's crazy about you. I mean, he really loves you. He does.
GINGER: Oh, come on. I went into this with my eyes open, you know. I knew the bottom could drop out at any time. I'm a working girl, right? You don't think I'm gonna go into a situation like this if I don't think I'm gonna get covered on the back end.
NICKY: Sure.
GINGER: Am I right?
NICKY: I can see that. Sure.
GINGER: So, he put aside some jewelry for me. A lot of jewelry.
NICKY: You mean, like a lot of expensive jewelry? About how much?
GINGER: Mm, you want to steal it?
NICKY: No. I - I'm just curious, you know. I was wonderin' how much he would put into a thing like that. That's all.
GINGER: I'm told it's worth about a million dollars, maybe more.
NICKY: Well, there you go. But what does that tell ya? A million dollars in jewelry. Does that tell you the guy is crazy about you, or what?
GINGER: I should have never married him. He's a Gemini. A triple Gemini... duality. Gemini's the snake. You know you can't trust the snake. I mean it.
NICKY: I know what you mean.
NICKY: Listen, Ginger... you know, this is probably not... I don't have the answers anyway... and this is probably not what you want to hear right now, because you're a little upset with Ace.
GINGER: I do.
NICKY: I understand that. But, you know, I think you should try to make the best of it now. Go slow, you know. See what happens.
GINGER: He could have killed him! Okay? He could have killed him.
GINGER: He didn't have to hit him. It's not exactly like I'm sleepin' with the guy! And he makes me sneak around to see my own friends! What the fuck is that all about?
NICKY: Well, I guess it's 'cause he loves you so much. He's jealous and worried.
GINGER: He gives a fuck what I do?
NICKY: Look, I'll try to find out what the hell's goin' on. When I see him I'll talk to him.
GINGER: Okay.
NICKY: All right?
GINGER: Yeah. Thanks.
