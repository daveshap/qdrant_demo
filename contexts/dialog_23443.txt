GRAHAM: Because I enjoy interviewing women more than men.
ANN: All of these are interviews?
GRAHAM: Yes.
ANN: Can we look at one?
GRAHAM: No.
ANN: Why not?
GRAHAM: Because I promised each subject that no one would look at the tape except me.
ANN: What... what are these interviews about?
GRAHAM: The... interviews are about sex, Ann.
ANN: About sex?
GRAHAM: Yes.
ANN: What about sex?
GRAHAM: Everything about sex.
ANN: Like what?
GRAHAM: Like what they've done, what they do, what they don't do, what they want to do but are afraid to ask for, what they won't do even if asked. Anything I can think of.
ANN: You just ask them questions?
GRAHAM: Yes.
ANN: And they just answer them?
GRAHAM: Mostly. Sometimes they do things.
ANN: To you?
GRAHAM: No, not to me, for me, for the camera.
ANN: I don't... why... why do you do this?
GRAHAM: I'm sorry this came up.
ANN: This is just... so...
GRAHAM: Maybe you want to go.
ANN: Yes, I do.
ANN: I don't... he doesn't want you to come over.
CYNTHIA: What do you mean he doesn't want me to come over? Did you tell him about me?
ANN: No, I didn't.
CYNTHIA: Why not?
ANN: Because I never got around to it.
CYNTHIA: Well, why?
ANN: Because. Cynthia, look, John was right. Graham is strange. Very strange. You don't want to get involved with him.
CYNTHIA: What the hell happened over there? Did he make a pass at you?
ANN: No!
CYNTHIA: Then what's the story, what's this strange" bullshit all of a sudden? Is he drowning puppies
ANN: No, it's nothing like that.
CYNTHIA: Well, what? Is he dangerous?
ANN: No, he's not dangerous. Not physically.
CYNTHIA: Well, what, then?
ANN: I don't want to talk about it.
CYNTHIA: Then why'd you call me?
ANN: I don't know.
CYNTHIA: Hello.
JOHN: Cynthia. John.
CYNTHIA: Not today. I've got other plans.
JOHN: Oh. Well, when, then?
CYNTHIA: How about inviting me over to dinner?
JOHN: You know what I mean.
CYNTHIA: Yeah, I know what you mean.
