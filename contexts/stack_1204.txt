azure sql - create index, does DB have to be offline? New to Azure SQL. Simple example to ask question.<br>Table Cars. Want to add an non clustered index to Cars table. Takes a long time, say 30 min during staging test deploy. When upgrading production Azure SQL, can we leave the database online while building a table index? During this time while the table is building, can applications send inserts/updates to this table? Or do we need to take the production DB offline for 30 to build this index?
