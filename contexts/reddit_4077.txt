Online dating makes me feel replacable
Ive tried bumble for a few months now. I went out with a guy i really liked but it didn’t work out, last I heard he was seeing another girl he met on bumble too. I was on bumble and switched to ‘show everyone’ so I got a peek at what profiles guys see. I started swiping and it made me think like ‘this is probably what (guy) did right after we stopped dating’. So I dunno, I’m not hung up on that guy but it made me feel weird. Like how online dating feels so... like its just this ready thing? Go through bad breakup? You can get a rebound by this weekend. 

I know that thats just how the world works now but I cant help but feel insecure. If a guy doesnt like me then he can easily replace me kind of thing.

Edit: I fell asleep and this blew up! Thank you for all the responses and interesting discussion! :) 

And yes that guy was very good looking but an a-hole. A narcissist. He’d get matches but the girls wouldn’t stay very long.
