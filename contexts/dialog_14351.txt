JACKIE: I saw Ray the other day. Boy is he pissed he missed all the excitement.
MAX: What's he doing?
JACKIE: He's on to a new thing. He's after a guy who owns a gun shop he says is woefully and wantonly" selling assault rifles to minors. He says he's gonna take him down if it's the last thing he does."
MAX: Did you tell him you were leaving?
JACKIE: I told him I might.
MAX: That's Ordell's.
JACKIE: They've confiscated all his other stuff. But this one's sorta left over. The registration's in the glove box, the keys were under the seat... What's a matter, haven't you ever borrowed someone's car?
MAX: Not after they're dead.
JACKIE: I didn't use you, Max.
MAX: I didn't say you did.
JACKIE: I never lied to you.
MAX: I know.
JACKIE: We're partners.
MAX: I'm fifty-five-years old. I can't blame anybody for anything I do.
JACKIE: Do you blame yourself for helping me?
JACKIE: I'd feel a whole lot better if you took some more money.
MAX: You'll get over that.
MAX: Where're you going?
JACKIE: Spain.
MAX: Madrid or Barcelona?
JACKIE: Start off in Madrid. Ever been there?
