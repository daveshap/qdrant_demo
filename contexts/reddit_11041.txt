If you're only interested in your child's grades and nothing else, you are a terrible parent.

EDIT: I am so unbelievably disappointed in all of you that upvoted this post. Here's why:

There are a LOT of people on r/teenagers that farm karma using this exact type of post - they point out something completely obvious and describe it as a "huge problem of our time", aim the blame at an obscure group of people that can't explain their POV (usually feminists or vegans), and then gain huge amounts of karma thanks to everyone's anger, frustrations and pent-up rage. I put exactly ZERO effort into making this post, and I've just exploited all of your stress to get useless internet numbers.

Shame on all of you for falling for this, and for choosing this kind of worthless garbage to represent this subreddit on the front page.

Also holy shit you guys are salty, that's hilarious.
