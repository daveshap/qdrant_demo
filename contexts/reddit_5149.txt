Put in my notice for a company I have been with for 11 years because I found a new job. My current company is trying to keep me by offering me more money.
I told my current company what I would want to make in order to remain where I am. After a few days they came back with a number that was a good bit under my asking. Therefore I have decided to remain on track for resigning. How do I respond politely, while remaining in good standing for my remaining time? Is e-mail better than a phone call? Whats the best etiquette?
