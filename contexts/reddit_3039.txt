What're some good careers for a 53 year old single mother to pursue? (My mom)
 Hi, my mom's 53 and she has really bad arthritis in her hands and hips which she can't get surgery for because she can't miss work. It's gotten to the point where she can't even hold a pencil. I help around the house a lot but she works so much hands on labor that it's terrible. She's working 6 days a week at 2 jobs. Those being a "chef" at a local gas station (not really a real chef. She just makes eggs, pancakes, and stuff) and a cleaning lady. She's usually working around 8-12 hours a day counting both jobs and the day she has off, she babysitts my 2 year old nephew. We don't have a lot of money. Our family's income is below 30,000 and I don't want her to stress more when my sister and I leave since there's gonna be more manual labor around the house. I'm about to be a senior come September and my sister's gonna be a freshman too. So I was wondering if there's ANY decent careers she might be able to pursue that'd be cheap and that could possibly work with her schedule? I know it's a long shot, I'm just desperate for her. She's always wanted to be a vet since she loves animals (more than anybody I know), she loves learning about crime, is really into medical stuff, loves helping children and the mentally disabled (since her nephew has autism), and even loves tattooing (she was a tattoo teacher at a VoTech school before the arthritis.) She dropped out of college and always says if she had the chance again she'd finish it. So I just want her to have that chance. Any answer is helpful, she'd love any job that paid decently where she didn't have to work 24/7.
