RACHEL: Good morning.
ELAINE: You didn't have to...
RACHEL: I wanted to. you were kind to take us in last night. Anyway, I needed something to do. I was so angry with your brother. He's so... agaanisish!
ELAINE: Aganishish? Yeah, that sounds like John.
RACHEL: Just a minute. I'll pour you some coffee.
ELAINE: You're not carrying a bullwhip... how'd you manage to put my kids to work?
RACHEL: I made it a contest... the one who does best gets his cereal back first. Children like to help... they only need to be kept after a little bit.
