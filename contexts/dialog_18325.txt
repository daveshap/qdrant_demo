GALAHAD: Well ...
ZOOT: I'm afraid our life must seem very dull and quiet compared to yours. We are but eightscore young blondes, all between sixteen and nineteen-and-a-half, cut off in this castle, with no one to protect us. Oooh. It is a lonely life ... bathing ... dressing ... undressing ... making exciting underwear....
ZOOT: We are just not used to handsome knights ... But you are wounded!
GALAHAD: No, It's nothing!
ZOOT: You must see the doctors immediately. You must lie down.
PIGLET: Well, what seems to be the trouble?
GALAHAD: They're doctors?
