Average, millionaire or billionaire?
I've been contemplating which lifestyle I should direct my efforts to achieve. Technically, I have 1 year left before I'm no longer a teen, and feel like I have these 3 future timelines laid ahead of me. Please advise me solely considering the lifestyle to be pursued and not the feasibility of it. 

Average - I wouldn't mind just working part-time jobs at like 7/11, just enough to get myself through everyday. A life where my level of contention is low enough for me to remain thrifty and still make some savings (am not really a materialistic person). A bachelor for life. And basically impacting no one's life. 

Millionaire - work enough through trading forex, stocks and the like coupled with some online businesses, to gain financial freedom and simply carry on with my hobbies and have a family simply to have the means to enjoy life fully. Impact a small amount of people. 

Billionaire - an extension of the millionaire's life, but to use the income gaimed as a capital to start a tech company, or agricultural etc. Probably staying single in the long term. But, i get to impact millions of lives deeply. Quite possibly for the better. 

Yes, I am attributing wealth claimed to lives impacted. To me, that is the significance of accumulation of money. But I remain unsure as to which path to venture on. Please share your insights fellow netizens. 


P. S. am new here
