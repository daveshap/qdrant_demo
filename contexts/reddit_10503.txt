does anyone else ever felt better after writing a suicide note/planning?
(Copied and pasted from r/depression)

I’ve had a long history of the crazies. I’ve had my ups and downs, planned suicides, not went through with it for some reason or another. But the other night I spent hours researching suicide methods (I don’t have easy access to my gun anymore, which was my main plan last year, since I’m at college) and I wrote out a note and everything, then fell asleep. The next day was the best I’d felt in months honestly. It was weird. I’d spent the whole night being the most suicidal I’ve been since before I got on antidepressants (got off them at the start of the summer...probably a bad idea but I don’t like being numb) and then the next day I was social, I talked to people, I felt actually okay. It was weird. I went back on a decline after that but it was nice feeling good again. I know it’s not normal to be writing suicide notes and planning my own demise and all that jazz, but is it weird to feel so much better after? Like I don’t know if it was just a needed release or what, because I mean I still want to kill myself, I’m not better. But I’m just curious if anyone else has ever experienced the same sort of feeling. Sorry if this is dumb. I’m tired.
