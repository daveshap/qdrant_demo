PSA: You can shop at Costco with nothing but a Costco gift card (no membership required!)
If you want to shop at Costco occasionally but can’t afford the membership, all you have to do is find a friend or family member with a membership and have them buy you a stack of $10 gift cards. Every time you want to go to Costco, you bring in one of the gift cards and show it to the person at the door.

Depending on the store they might have you stop by the membership desk, or just let you in. Then at the register, you pay for $10 of stuff with the gift card and the balance with cash or credit.

As far as I know, this works for every Costco in every state – it has to, otherwise Costco gift cards wouldn’t really work as gifts.
