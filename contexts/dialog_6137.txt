CUSTOMER: I'M GONNA BREAK YOUR FUCKING HEAD! YOU FUCKING JERKOFF!
DANTE: Sir! Sir, I'm sorry! He didn't mean it! He was trying to get me.
CUSTOMER: Well, he missed!
DANTE: I know. I'm sorry. Let me refund your cigarette money, and we'll call it even.
CUSTOMER: This is the last time I ever come here. And if I ever see you again, I'm gonna break your fucking head open!
DANTE: What the fuck did you do that for?
RANDAL: Two reasons: one, I hate when the people can't shut up about the stupid tabloid headlines.
DANTE: Jesus!
RANDAL: And two, to make a point: title does not dictate behavior.
DANTE: What?
RANDAL: If title dictated my behavior, as a clerk serving the public, I wouldn't be allowed to spit a mouthful of water at that guy. But I did, so my point is that people dictate their own behavior. Hence, even though I'm a clerk in this video store, I choose to go rent videos at Big Choice. Agreed?
DANTE: You're a danger to both the dead and the living.
RANDAL: I like to think I'm a master of my own destiny.
DANTE: Please, get the hell out of here.
RANDAL: I know I'm your hero.
TRAINER: Sounds to me like somebody needs to hit the gym.
DANTE: Excuse me?
TRAINER: I heard you strain when you put the milk in the bag. That milk only weighs about seven pounds.
DANTE: I didn't strain. I sighed.
TRAINER: I don't think so. That was a grunt; a deep inhalation of oxygen to aid in the stretching of muscles. I'm a trainer. I know what that sound signifies: you're out of shape.
DANTE: I don't think so.
TRAINER: Oh, I do. You made the same noise when you reached across the counter for my cash. Your muscles are thin and sadly underutilized.
DANTE: They are not.
TRAINER: Yes, they are. You're out of shape.
DANTE: What are you talking about? There's no fat on this body.
TRAINER: No fat, but no tone either. You don't get enough exercise.
HEATHER: Are you open?
DANTE: Yes.
HEATHER: Just the paper.
DANTE: Thirty-fire.
TRAINER: Let me ask you a question: Do you think this guy's out of shape?
HEATHER: I don't know. I can't really tell from here.
TRAINER: He is.
DANTE: I am not.
TRAINER: How much can you bench?
DANTE: I don't know.
HEATHER: I'd say about sixty, seventy-tops.
DANTE: I know I can bench more than that!
TRAINER: I think the lady called it.
HEATHER: My ex-boyfriend was about his height, but he was much bulkier. He could bench two-fifty, three hundred easy.
TRAINER: I do about three-fifty, four.
HEATHER: No way!
TRAINER: Feel that.
HEATHER: That's tight. Solid.
TRAINER: Now feel his. Roll up your sleeve, chief.
DANTE: Oh for God's sake!
TRAINER: See? You're ashamed. You know you're out of shape. Take my card. I can help you tone that body up in no time. Get you on an aerobics and free-weights program.
SUITED MAN: You open?
DANTE: Yes. I'm not out of shape.
SUITED MAN: Excuse me, but have you been here all day?
DANTE: What?
HEATHER: He's got those love handles.
DANTE: I don't have love handles.
SUITED MAN: Were you working here at about four o'clock?
DANTE: I've been here since six o'clock this morning. Why?
TRAINER: It's probably from being around all this food every day.
HEATHER: Oh, I know. If I had to work here all day, I'd be bloated and out of shape, too.
DANTE: I'm not out of shape!
SUITED MAN: Can I have your name please?
DANTE: Dante Hicks. Why? What is this about?
HEATHER: You're Dante Hicks? Oh my God! I didn't even recognize you!
TRAINER: Because he's out of shape.
DANTE: Do I know you?
HEATHER: You remember Alyssa Jones? She hung out with...
DANTE: Caitlin Bree. Yeah?
HEATHER: I'm her sister.
DANTE: You're Alyssa's sister? Heather?
HEATHER: Yep. I remember you got caught in my parents' room with Caitlin once.
TRAINER: Did you say Caitlin Bree?
DANTE: Yeah.
TRAINER: Pretty girl, about this girl's height- dark hair-gorgeous body?
DANTE: Yeah?
TRAINER: And your name is Dante Hicks? You went to high school with her? You played hockey?
DANTE: How do you know that?
TRAINER: Oh man! Hey, you still going out with her?
DANTE: No, she's getting married.
TRAINER: To you?
HEATHER: To an Asian design major.
TRAINER: Shit! Don't take this the wrong way, but I used to fuck her.
DANTE: What?
TRAINER: While you two were dating in high school. We're talking four, five years ago, back when I drove a Trans- Am.
HEATHER: Oh my God! You're Rick Derris?
TRAINER: Yeah!
DANTE: You know him?
HEATHER: Caitlin used to talk about him all the time.
TRAINER: Really?
HEATHER: Oh yeah. You were the built older guy with the black Trans and the big...
DANTE: Wait a second! You used to sleep with Caitlin Bree? While I was dating her?
TRAINER: All the time. That girl was like a rabbit.
DANTE: I... I don't believe this...
HEATHER: I still remember Caitlin telling us about that time you two went to that motel-the one with the mirrors and the hot tub in the room.
DANTE: THE GLADES MOTEL?
TRAINER: Holy shit! She told you about that! Buddy of mine worked there. Said he watched the whole thing. They used to film people at that hotel; nobody knew about it.
HEATHER: She said one time you set up a tent on the beach and you guys did it in the middle of this big rainstorm.
DANTE: What? When? When did all this shit happen?
TRAINER: Hey man, that was a long time ago. Don't let it get to you.
HEATHER: I'm surprised you never found out about it, Dante. Everybody in school knew-even in my class.
DANTE: Jesus Christ, what next?
SUITED MAN: Here you go.
DANTE: What's this?
SUITED MAN: A fine, for five hundred dollars.
DANTE: WHAT?
