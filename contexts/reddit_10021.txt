Question about Career path
Hello All,

I'm in an interesting conundrum about attending graduate level education in Higher Education/Student Affairs.  

During undergraduate I had several para-professional positions (RA/Student Orientation) and really enjoyed my experience.  After graduating I've worked several years in the non-profit/advocacy world and have managed to hold several mid-level managerial positions for major nonprofit. I have about 5 years of profesional experience in LGBTQ/Advocacy related work and am in the 40 - 60k salary range.

I love my current work but I have nagging need for more education and a real love for student leadership development (I've specifically focused on the training of LGBTQ students in advocacy skills). 

I've been accepted to a great HESA program, but I'm concerned that in many ways it will be a step back for me monetarily.  Will my past experience help me into higher positions that would have better pay than most out of grad school jobs?

Also I have another internal dilemma if I want to go all the way and obtain my doctorates? Do any of you have good sources for the higher potential of a phd in Higher Ed or Administration?

I really appreciate any insight!
