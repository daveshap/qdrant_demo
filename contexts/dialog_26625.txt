MARY: So do you like your new room?
NICOLE: It's interesting.
MARY: Your Dad spent all his spare time in here. He wanted to make it absolutely perfect.
NICOLE: I feel like a princess.
NICOLE: Is this mine?
MARY: Yes. It's a present.
NICOLE: From you?
MARY: No. From Mr. Stephens. That was him on the phone just now. He was calling to see how you were.
NICOLE: Who's Mr. Stephens?
SAM: He's a lawyer. He's our lawyer.
NICOLE: You and Mom have a lawyer?
SAM: Well, yes. He's your lawyer too.
NICOLE: My lawyer? Why do I need a lawyer?
MARY: Maybe we shouldn't be talking about this just now, with you barely home. Aren't you hungry, honey? Want me to fix you something?
NICOLE: No. What's this lawyer business?
