SIM: Dr. Argon, everything's starting to come apart here. You hired me to take care of these matters of security and I am trying, but elements are making my job impossible.
ARGON: Have you found Dr. Bright?
SIM: No. The captain of the containment crew is closing down the main lab. He says the area has got to be evacuated.
NEBBLEMAN: He's probably right, sir, the building is probably going to collapse under its own weight.
SIM: And if we evacuate, what do you want to do with O'Brien?
ARGON: It'll be better for us if he simply disappears. The gardener will know what to do.
NEBBLEMAN: Wait, wait, can I at least have his body?
ARGON: Donated to science. Perfect.
