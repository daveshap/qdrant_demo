I got over 50 downvotes on a comment I left as a joke, and cried because I thought I hurt people's feelings
Someone left a comment that was a pun, and I joked about downvoting them because of it, but I actually upvoted instead, then commented that I upvoted it. I checked Reddit just now and saw that it had over 50 downvotes. I feel absolutely terrible. 

The comment I'm talking about: 
"I almost had to downvote your comment because of the pun. Take my upvote, you hilarious bastard."
