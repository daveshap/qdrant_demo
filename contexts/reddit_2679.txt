Is Linkedin Absolutely Necessary for Networking?
Hi Redditors

I'm one of the stubborn few that still believes in the Good ol' days and i'm finding it very difficult to conform to the whole social media thing.  Don't get me wrong, i think social media is great and that it has its merits, but honestly, sometimes i could care less about what my "friends" had for dinner, vacations, MLM recruiting efforts, and charities begging for everything under the sun.  With that said, i have quit social media and i'm blissfully unaware of all the drama caused my "friends" posts on Facebook.

Not long ago, i started talking to a recruiter that was having a career fair in my country, and she sounded very interested on me.  I have been actively looking for a job (reading ads, applying online, requesting meetings, etc.) so for a senior recruiter to be interested on me, that's a big deal.  We chatted both on the phone and by email, made an appointment to meet at the company's career fair, and all went great.  I was told that as soon as the contract got approved, to expect a phone call for a potential opening.  I was also told that if i wanted to know the status of the contract, to follow the recruiter on Linkedin because that is the best most fastest way to contact her.  Problem is, i don't have a linked in account!  I also do not want one.  A few years back, i had started to build my profile on it but 2 seconds after it went "live" i got contacted by my ex which absolutely freaked me out.  It was then and there that i decided to forget about the whole linked thing, and i instantly deleted my account.  

So my question to you wise Redditors is:  Do i absolutely need to create an account in order to get recruiters to look at me and the experience i have to offer?   Am i screwed by not wanting to put my stuff out there?  I sincerely appreciate your honest advice.
