Which would be the better warehouse job: UPS or Amazon?
I have been out of work for years due to personal reasons and have been looking around for part time work so I can get back in the swing of things. I've become interested in the package handler positions at Amazon and UPS. I'm wondering if anybody has experience or knowledge with these two places that could tell me which would be the better choice? This isn't a place where I'm looking to start a career, just a part time gig to keep me active and get some extra money coming in.
