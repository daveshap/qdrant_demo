A conflict between lab manager and a postdoc? Red flag?
Hi. Before I joined this lab, I talked to lots of people from the lab, and they are great. A postdoc, however, told me that the lab manager "is a nice person but he is very bad at explaining the purpose of experiments and tends to get frustrated when people ask him why." Then after getting into the lab, the lab manager told me that the postdoc I mentioned before "is a nice person but she isn't scientifically rigorous and leaves a mass when she did a XXX experiment." Both of them told me not to get very close to each other, so I guess they might have some conflicts under the table. Since I will work with them for a very long time, is this something I should worry about? I mean the lab itself is great and the PI is awesome. As a grad student, I guess I will mainly work with the PI. However, both of them seem to want me to pick a side to stand. Should I ask the PI what happened before between them? Will this conflict influence my grad study a lot in this lab? Thanks!
