BATEMAN: Never. I mean...I don't really like... singers.
KIMBALL: Not a big music fan, eh?
BATEMAN: No, I like music. Just-they're-Huey's too... black sounding. For me.
KIMBALL: Well, to each his own. So-lunch, Thursday? I'll call your secretary about reservations.
BATEMAN: I'll be there.
CHRISTIE: I'm not so sure about this. I had to go to Emergency after last time...
BATEMAN: Oh this won't be anything like last time, I promise.
CHRISTIE: I don't think so.
