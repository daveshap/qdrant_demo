Settling for your first SA job
I graduated from my SA degree program in December and have been job searching since. Iâ€™m location bound to the Philadelphia area. My passion is Advising/Student Success but I havenâ€™t had any luck so far. Iâ€™m worried that I will have to settle for an Admissions position to get my foot in the door. 

I currently work a full time job making about $20/hr which has been great but it offers no benefits and I will be losing my parents health insurance in July. 

Should I start applying for jobs that I know I will have to fake interest in during a job interview? ðŸ˜” Feeling defeated .  And tempted to apply for jobs outside of SA.
