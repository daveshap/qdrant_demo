Mental Hospitals never work
So a bit of backstory: In my state, if you show any sign of wanting to hurt yourself or others, can you be forcibly sent to a mental hospital (for a max of 3 days) after going to the ER to check if you've tried anything and being assessed by a psychologist (for at least 30 minutes). 

This has happened to me twice. The first time, I only got assessed by the psychologist for about 10 minutes but thankfully I was released after a few hours.

The second time however, was much worse. So I went to the ER, had to stay overnight, wasn't seen by a psychologist until 2 days later AFTER being sent to the mental hospital (which I'm 99% sure is illegal). Also, I didn't get registered into the mental hospital's system until 6 hours after I arrived because the nurse had to do other stuff. Not to mention while in the ER, I overheard nurses complaining about all the different patients. While in the mental hospital place, I never actually got better. I just trained myself to be all smiley and happy. Because no one wants to be around someone who is depressed.

TLDR; mental hospitals cut corners, don't care about you, and teach you to repress and hide your feelings.

EDIT: some other bs at happened at the second time (which was at a university hospital, btw) included: 

because my family was calling so much the psychologist outright complained to me about how they were making her job harder. 

My mom tried to make sure i got evaluated before i left the er but while my mom was talking with the nurse, the nurse hung up and said "im sorry, but this is getting annoying" right to my face.

A diabetic girl was basically being starved because it was the weekend and they couldnt get a nutritionist on the weekend, so a nurse had to sneak her sandwiches.

While at the ER, i overheard nurses/service techs complain about the mental health patients.
