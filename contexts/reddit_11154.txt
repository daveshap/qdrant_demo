Today marks 4 years.
Today marks 4 years since my 6 month old son passed away, and not one person in my family could be bothered to call me. My step monster didn’t even acknowledge today. Not a “thinking about you” not even a fucking like on my Facebook status. My mother didn’t even text me, but she sure as shit made a Facebook post about it to garner sympathy from her boomer friends who think likes and prayers solve everything.
