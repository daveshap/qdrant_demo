Lucifer (TV series) devilface in Season 3 Episode 7 In the TV series Lucifer, Season 3's big drama is that Lucifer looses his devil face, but his angel wings grow back even if he cuts them off. In Episode 7 the turning point of the plot comes when he actually shows his devil face to the man being interrogated, and he himself also clearly sees it in the mirror. Since then I've watched the later episodes up to 10 and the only mentions about his devil face are comments about him not having it, with no mention of it appearing on him. Does anybody know what the explanation for this is? It really bugs me.
