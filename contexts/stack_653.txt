Removing Kubuntu from External Drive and Reformating For some obscure reason, which seemed like a good idea at the time, I installed Kubuntu onto an external USB 1TB drive. It never worked.Now, I would like to use that drive as storage but cannot delete any of the installation or boot files. I also cannot upload any other files onto it.How would I reformat the whole drive so it can be used as general storage which can be read by linux, android and windows devicesMany thanks
