I'll put it bluntly, I'm 26 and have never applied for a job. I have a year until graduation, and I'm not sure where to start if I want to be more professional. I want to work on my appearance, how I talk, and my capacity for applying for jobs in my field (geosciences). What are the first steps?
So I have work experience, just not in my field so much. I have been laying tile for my friend's dad off and on since high school. I have 1 year where I traveled around Australia on my own, working odd jobs along the way (fast food, construction, fruit picking, yard work, digging ditches). I have spent summers and winter breaks usually hanging out with family, but I run their forklifts for their company for a couple weeks while I'm there. I've also done some summer work as a sailboat rigger a few years ago.

But the problem is I never needed an application or an interview for these jobs. Now I'm applying for things and trying to impress people I don't know, and I don't want my lack of experience in the formal job market to show so much.

Right now I'm struggling with asking for help. I've met some people at conventions who gave me their card and told me to call them, but I can't seem to find the confidence to follow through. It's the same with my research projects from my professors, I'm afraid to reach out because I don't feel in shape to work with them. I certainly don't want to waste their time or betray their trust if they give me any opportunity.

There are a million things I need to work on, but I feel confident in what I've done, and I have a year to bulk up my resume. I'm really trying to get to a level of professionalism before I start sending out hordes of applications.
