BUD: Hi...can I buy you a drink? I'm celebrating tonight.
BLONDE: Please, no thanks...
BUD: Look, I know you get approached a lot by dubious men, but I'm different, I never talk to strangers, all my life I've been waiting for the right person to walk across the room... you're that person, you don't know it but I do and if you walk away now I'll never see you again or you me. You'll grow old.
BLONDE: Oh really.
BUD: I'll grow old. We'll both die. And we'll never have known each other. That's sad. At least one drink for a dreamer...What's your favorite drink?
BLONDE: Grand Marnier.
BUD: Sounds like a french word, what is it?
BLONDE: It's a romantic and tragic drink.
BUD: Sounds tempting. I prefer mine with a twist of fate. You know like us meeting. Don't go away...
