Should I let an employee work after they know they will be fired?
Basically we're moving locations and my boss doesn't want someone to continue at the new location due to performance issues. Is it better to tell them and let them work for the last couple days, or fire them outright.

UPDATE: They decided not to come to the new location of their own will. They said the travel would not be worth it.
