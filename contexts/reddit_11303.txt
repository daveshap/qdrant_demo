Grandma update
I posted a couple weeks ago that my grandma had been diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer on May 2nd. 

She died May 25th at 8:42 pm at a hospice care center. It still doesn't seem real. I guess that's normal though. 

I miss you so much, Grandma. I'll love you forever and think of you always. Thank you for giving me a home to grow up in. Rest in peace.
