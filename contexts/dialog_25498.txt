PICARD: Admiral Janeway. Good to see you.
JANEWAY: 
PICARD: With or without the rest of the fleet?
JANEWAY: A diplomatic mission. We've been invited, believe it or not. Seems there's been some kind of internal political shakeup. The new Praetor, someone called Shinzon, has requested a Federation envoy.
PICARD: New Praetor?
JANEWAY: There's more... as always. He's Reman.
JANEWAY: Believe me, we don't under- stand it either. You're the closest ship so I want you to high tail it over there and hear what he has to say. Get the lay of the land, If the Empire becomes unstable, it could mean trouble for the entire quadrant.
PICARD: Understood.
JANEWAY: 
PICARD: Not with the Romulans.
JANEWAY: 
PICARD: Just lucky, Admiral.
JANEWAY: Let's hope that luck holds. Janeway out.
