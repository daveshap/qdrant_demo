How to disable ambient noise reduction? It used to be in that one could disable the ambient noise reduction in the sound preferences.  But I can't seem to find that option anymore, which means when I record sound with the built-in mic I have to accept the warbling effect.According to Help, the option should be there so long as there isn't a 4-channel built-in microphone format chosen in Audio MIDI setup.  But my internal microphone is a 2-channel according to Audio MIDI Setup.  How can I get the check box to appear so that I can cancel the noise reduction effect? I have a Late 2013 27\" iMac
