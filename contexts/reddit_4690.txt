No job, no money, no friends, no family, no pets, no future.
Hi guys, this is my first post. I think my post title sums up my life. Iâ€™m really struggling to see the point in life. I have always worked hard and have been self employed for nearly 20 years. In the last year or so work has dried up and Iâ€™m not much good at anything else. To compound all this Iâ€™m not a very bright guy and really canâ€™t see the point in carrying on with things and canâ€™t see a way forward in life.

Iâ€™m not sure what to do as my depression has also recently wrecked my marriage but fortunately I donâ€™t have any kids. I just need some advice really. ðŸ˜­ I feel very alone. I also have no pets as iâ€™m Not allowed them where I live. I literally have nothing.
