I hate how people dismiss us when we openly say that we are suicidal but when someone keep quiet and kill them selves people be shocked like “They never said anything I didn’t know” WAKE TF UP AND LOVE ME STOP DISMISSING HOW I FEEL
My parents kicked me out for being suicidal, now a family friend killed himself and they are all suffering not knowing why because he was relatively “happy” and had a good life... Meanwhile my mother while I was panicking she handed me a knife.
