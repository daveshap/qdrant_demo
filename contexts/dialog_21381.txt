VIVIAN: We worked for that money. We were gonna put together enough to get out of that dump we live in, get off this street.
KIT: Viv... don't be stupid. We're whores.
VIVIAN: I just saw somebody pulled out of a dumpster. I wonder how much she made tonight?
KIT: Don't be mad at me. I'll pay you back. I promise.
VIVIAN: I thought you were giving up that drug shit.
KIT: I will. I'm trying. Meanwhile I got some crack left, you wanna get high?
VIVIAN: No, let's go to work. Okay?
KIT: Okay. I'm sorry I said your dream was stupid.
