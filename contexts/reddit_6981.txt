Running into the manager who laid you off
I got laid off a while back, and I dread running into my manager or any of my former colleagues when I am walking around. In my town, people in my industry normally work and hang around in the same area. My manager's reason for laying me off was basically that they found someone who was "better deal" than I was. When I see my former colleagues, I rather just look the other way and move on. Other than the colleagues that I am close with, I don't really have much to say to the ones I am not close with. If I run into them, and were to have a conversation, I would feel embarrass that I get laid off. If you were ever laid off, how do you deal with this? Just running away or ignoring them solve the issue?
