MARY: Mrs. Redi, there's one thing —-with Jacqueline gone, how do you carry on the business? What do you do with the receipts? How do you sign checks--?
MRS. REDI: Mary, I'm amazed. Didn't Jacqueline tell you? She sold the business to me at least eight months ago. It's my business now.
MARY: I didn't know.
MRS. REDI: Yes —— and I must say I've done very well with it -- perhaps even better than Jacqueline.
MARY: There's nothing you can think of -- old letters, anything, that might give me some hint as to where I might find Jacqueline?
MRS. REDI: Leave me your address, and if I find anything, I'll get in touch with you.
MARY: I'm stopping at the Chatsworth.
MRS. REDI: Thank you, my dear.
FRANCES: Why, Mary --
MARY: Hello, Frances.
FRANCES: How's Miss Jacqueline?
MARY: I don't know. That's why I came to see Mrs. Redi. I'm trying to find her.
FRANCES: You mean Miss Jacqueline's gone, and you don't know where she is?
FRANCES: I don't get this. Miss Jacqueline was always so fond of you -- she was always talking about you -— had your picture in her office.
MARY: I know. For the first time I'm beginning to be frightened. I almost feel as if I'd never known my sister.
FRANCES: Nothing's happened to her. It's just that I can't understand her not getting in touch with you.
MARY: I can't understand it at all.
FRANCES: Well, don't worry. I saw Miss Jacqueline only a week ago. I saw her at a little restaurant the boy friend took me to -- an Italian place down in the Village —-	The Dante.""
MARY: The Dante?""
FRANCES: It's on Peary Street. Just ask the people who run it. They'll remember her. People who see Miss Jacqueline never forget her.
MARY: I'll try there.
MARY: I'm worry to bother you. I want to ask you about my sister.
ROMARI: Yes?
MARY: I thought you might know her. She was seen here about a week ago. Her name is Jacqueline Gibson.
ROMARI: I don't know no Gibson. This is a restaurant. Many people come here.
MARY: She's very beautiful.
