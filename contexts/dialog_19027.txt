RAJA: Maybe she's right.
FURIOUS: Are you serious? This is the break we've been waiting for!
SHOVELER: What are you talking about?
FURIOUS: What have the famous superheroes got that we don't?
RAJA: Agents?
FURIOUS: Archenemies! Casanova isn't just a criminal -- he's a supervillain. Stopping him could be our ticket to fame, fortune -- and babes!
SHOVELER: And it would be the right thing to do.
FURIOUS: Yeah yeah -- and that, too.
RAJA: But there's only three of us, and he's got the entire brotherhood of evil at his disposal.
FURIOUS: Then maybe it's time for us to form our own brotherhood... a brotherhood of righteous, crime fighting, skull cracking, Disco Boy bashing, warriors of the night!
SHOVELER: I'm liking this.
FURIOUS: I say we send out the word -- and summon all of the unsung superheroes we know!
