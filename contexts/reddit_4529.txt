I have no ambition to do anything besides sleep, watch tv, & go to work
For the past several years I haven’t had any ambition to do anything besides basic things to keep me alive. I have no desire to clean my house, do any yard work, find a new hobby, etc. I make sure my dishes & clothes are clean but that’s about it. And I mow my lawn once a week but don’t do any landscaping. I keep telling myself I should work out, start writing, get crafty but instead just continue to watch Netflix. Has anyone found any way to get off their butt & focus on something? Any specific med that might help me get started? I should also mention that I work overnights but I feel this problem started before my sleep schedule got all turned upside down. And even if it was related to sleeping during the day, I’ve been working nights for seven years, wouldn’t my body adapt by now?
