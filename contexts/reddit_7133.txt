I'm working as an engineer for a tiny/fragile startup, it's chill and I like the actual project... am I a tool for "volunteering" some hours a week?
My misgiving is I'm not being offered any alternative compensation, EG shares, and the boss is a massive prick (to everyone else and thinks I don't connect the dots). I've got a date in mind wrapping up what will be our first product release, at which point I'm going to leverage employment offers from elsewhere and see what happens.

I'm hourly and until better investments/funding is secured, I'm basically working average of of 5 "free" hours a week since my boss keeps making demands like I'm salaried.

My question is: How common is this in engineering and startup companies?

The reason I'm staying is it's literally right next to my parent's place, allowing me to save 800+ per month that would otherwise be rent, and the boss does not give two fucks when it comes to me taking my own "flexible" hours or even drinking on the job. It's absurdly chill and casual all around. The reason I took the job was for the experience and title, which I plan on leaving with that when I feel ready to move on.
