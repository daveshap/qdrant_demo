A Declaration of Independence against the Collegeboard
 When in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for students to protest the injustices imposed on them by an oppressive organization, they must declare the causes which motivate them to the protest.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all students have the right to sanity, not getting ripped off, and decent educational standards. That, whenever any organisation in control of students becomes destructive to these ends, then it becomes reasonable to protest their injustices. To prove this, let us state the facts of this organization.

1. The cost for the SAT is $47.50. **$47.50** to take a multiple choice test
2. Hardly any multiple choice tests are released to students to study from. My calc teacher makes new tests and quizzes EVERY YEAR
3. In order to gain access to questions, students must buy books CREATED by the college board so they make money
4. The president of the college board, a non profit organization, made 1.3 MILLION in 2009. Over twice sal khan's salary at khan academy and more than the Red Cross president salary.
5. For having a monopoly over financial aid and testing products
6. For having to pay $12 PER COLLEGE to sent scores. To send a number
7. To have to pay $16 PER COLLEGE to send a financial aid report (the irony). Meanwhile the FAFSA is completely free
8. Paying 19 executives over $300,000 a year from student money
9. For having multiple reporting errors in their [process](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/eqbkfe/fuck_the_college_board/)
10. Having to pay $98 dollars to go through an AP exam (3 hours of death)
11. In addition to these $98, students have to pay for study materials due to lack of resources posted online
12. For playing mind games with students (you can send your score to 4 colleges for free before you get your score report or pay to send to colleges after you get your scores????? What??)
13. For selling student data [College Board Search — Pricing and Payment Policies](https://collegeboardsearch.collegeboard.org/pastudentsrch/support/licensing/pricing-payment-policies) without making them sufficiently aware [The College Board's Student Privacy Pledge Status – Pledge to Parents & Students](https://studentprivacypledge.org/the-college-boards-student-privacy-pledge-status/)
14. Recycling SAT exams allowing for cheating
15. Rush shipping is an extra $15. So they can ship it early but they don’t just to milk money

In every stage we have petitioned to our oppressors, yet they have not answered our complaints. 

But it’s over now, I’m a senior now going to college next year where I won’t get ripped off with useless bloated costs. Oh wait…
