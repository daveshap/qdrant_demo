SOLLOZZO: The Don was slipping; in the old days I could never have gotten to him. Now he's dead, nothing can bring him back. Talk to Sonny, talk to the Caporegimes, Clemenza and Tessio...it's good business.
HAGEN: Even Sonny won't be able to call off Luca Brasi.
SOLLOZZO: I'll worry about Luca. You take care of Sonny and the other two kids.
HAGEN: I'll try...It's what the Don would want us to do.
SOLLOZZO: Good...then you can go... I don't like violence. I'm a businessman, and blood is a big expense.
