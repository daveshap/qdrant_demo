JIMMY: How is he? Okay? Are they busting his chops?
KAREN: He's okay. They sobered him up.
JIMMY: Did he say what they're asking him about?
KAREN: Jimmy. I don't know. I got so much else on my mind. I got the kids. We got no money.
JIMMY: I gotta talk to him as soon as I can.
KAREN: He says he's too hot. He doesn't even know I came here today. It's like he's crazy. Jimmy.
JIMMY: I know. I know. But it'll be okay. Don't worry. I got some money for you. It's down the block.
JIMMY: The third store down.
KAREN: Jimmy just stood there on the sidewalk. It felt funny. I started walking down the block, but I noticed the stores were empty.
