I need help im really sick
I am trying to get over a girl. Romantically is ok, i understand shes not interested, but she wont even talk to me and be friends. I have zero friends. The times we talked were some of the few i didnt feel miserable or hoping to die.

I get suicidal. I really do feel suicidal. But i always message her and tell her and beg for help. She used to respond but not any more. I was always serious but i always waited for her to help. I know it was very selfish but i genuinely wanted to die. I did it today just now. I want her to come and stop me and say she cares but i dont think so.

But i really do want to die. What do i do :(
