ELAINE: Maybe you're right. Twelve years after your daughter's born you decide to become a father.
VIKTOR: Better late than never.
ELAINE: I should fire you more often. The film's looking wonderful.
VIKTOR: You really think so?
ELAINE: Yes. To be honest I never quite saw this film before -- maybe it's the way Simone is playing it -- but what it's saying about the illusion of permanence in everyday life, how that's the only way we can love -- I think it's really going to mean something.
VIKTOR: Thank you. I'll tell Simone you liked it.
ELAINE: I'd love to tell her myself. When are you going to let me meet her?
VIKTOR: Soon. Soon.
ELAINE: Everyone I know has met her, Viktor.
VIKTOR: Everyone you know is lying.
ELAINE: That's true.
