Is there an easy way to implement INSPIRE model in PostGIS? I need to implement INSPIRE (Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community) model in PostGIS.I searched everywhere but couldn't find SQL file, or any other implementation that I could download. Is there any way to quickly auto generate empty tables with all relations, or do I have to manually generate 400+ tables?
