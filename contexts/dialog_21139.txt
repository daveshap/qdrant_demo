MARGO: I seem to remember that you like to help yourself.
MITCHELL: That's not very kind.
MARGO: Kind or not kind. What's the difference? It always ends up the same way.
MITCHELL: What's this?
MARGO: What does it look like?
MITCHELL: How long have you had it?
MARGO: Years, why?
MITCHELL: It's against the law to cross the border with a gun. The Canadian police might like to know about this.
MARGO: You already have the checks, darling.
MITCHELL: I didn't mean it that way I'm sorry.
MARGO: Oh, forget it. Clark Brandon's throwing a party up in his penthouse this evening. Take me?
MITCHELL: Of course.
MARGO: How about your new friend?
MITCHELL: I told you she's just..
MARGO: A girl you meet on the train. Excuse my bringing it up again. Be back in an hour. Right?
MITCHELL: Right.
MARGO: In an hour, Larry.
MITCHELL: Good afternoon, Mr. Campbell.
CAMPBELL: Mr. Mitchell.
MITCHELL: A little something on account perhaps?
CAMPBELL: Rather more than a little something, Mr. Mitchell.
MITCHELL: I'm afraid this is all for the moment.
CAMPBELL: I think we'd better discuss this in my office, Mr. Mitchell.
MITCHELL: Nothing to discuss. Tomorrow the sun will shine even brighter. Be grateful for small mercies.
