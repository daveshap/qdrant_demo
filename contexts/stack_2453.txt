Adding description text to attribute field using attribute table in QGIS? I'm using QGIS 3.0.1 and I would like to add a description text to an attribute field. I already use the alias text but I am interested in to store a more detailed description text for an attribute field like a tooltip or something similar. I know how to define conditional formatting (in qgis and python) but I'm not sure if it is possible to add this \"detailed\" information.Should this not be possible, could I use customized signals? I mean, when I press F1 something happens (e.g. I create a pop up with my description).With respect to my problem, I try to implement my own shortcut function using \"QShortcut\". This works but now I need the index of the selected field, similar to signal \"attributeValueChanged\". With this information I could create my own pop up with related description.Should this not be possible, I would create a dialog including a combo box where the user can select one of the fields of the layer. After that the related description would be displayed.
