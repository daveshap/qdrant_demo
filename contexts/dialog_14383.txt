JACOB: Doctor. Ph.D.
GEARY: Ah! I thought you were a mailman.
JACOB: I am.
GEARY: Then why aren't you teaching? Why aren't you in a university?
JACOB: I'm too messed up to teach.
GEARY: Ah! Well then, they're going to have to pay for that, aren't they?
JEZZIE: So tell me ... am I still an angel?
JACOB: With wings. You transport me, you know that? You carry me away.
JEZZIE: We're all angels, you know ... ... and devils. It's just what you choose to see.
JACOB: I love you, Jez.
JEZZIE: I know.
JACOB: Underneath all the bullshit, just love.
JEZZIE: Remember that.
JACOB: You know what? I feel ... exorcised ... like the demons are gone.
JEZZIE: How come? The army?
JACOB: In a way. At least now I have some idea of what was happening. If we can only get them to admit ... to explain what they did ... I don't know. Maybe it'd clear things up in my head. I'll tell you something, Jez, honestly ... I thought they were real.
JEZZIE: I put a frozen dinner in the oven, a Manhandler. It'll be ready at a quarter of. I threw a little salad together. It's in the fridge. I also bought some apple juice, Red Cheek. Don't drink it all. Oh, and Jake, your lawyer called.
JACOB: He did? When?
JEZZIE: While you were in the shower.
JACOB: Why didn't you call me?
JEZZIE: He didn't give me a chance. Look, honey, don't get upset, but he's not taking your case.
JACOB: What? What do you mean?
JEZZIE: He said you didn't have one.
JACOB: What's he talking about?
JEZZIE: I don't know. That's all he said. He wasn't very friendly. Oh, yeah. He said your buddies backed down. They chickened out, he said.
JACOB: I don't believe this.
JEZZIE: Baby, I'm sorry. I feel terrible. I'd stay and talk but I'm so late. Look, don't be upset. We'll talk when I get home. See you around midnight. Bye. And don't brood. Watch T.V. or something.
FRANK: Hello.
JACOB: Frank. It's Jake. Jacob SInger.
JACOB: Listen, I just got a strange call from Geary. He said the guys backed down. What's he talking about?
FRANK: That's right. We did.
JACOB: What does that mean, Frank? I don't get it. Why?
FRANK: It's hard to explain.
JACOB: Well, try, huh.
FRANK: I don't know if I can. It's just that war is war. Things happen.
JACOB: Things happen? What the fuck are you talking about? They did something to us, Frank. We have to expose this.
FRANK: There's nothing to expose.
JACOB: Jesus Christ! Who's been talking to you? What's going on? How can you just turn away? What about the others?
FRANK: They're not interested, Jake.
JACOB: Shit! You know it's not half the case if I go it alone. We're all suffering the same symptoms, Frank. The army is to blame. They've done something to us. How can you not want to know?
FRANK: Maybe it's not the army, Jake.
JACOB: What do you mean?
FRANK: Maybe there's a larger truth.
JACOB: What are you talking about?
FRANK: Maybe the demons are real.
JACOB: Goddamn it. What kind of bullshit is that?
FRANK: Listen, Jake. I gotta go.
JACOB: What the hell? What kind of mumbo jumbo ... ?
FRANK: I'm hanging up.
JACOB: Hey, wait!
FRANK: Don't bother to call again, okay?
