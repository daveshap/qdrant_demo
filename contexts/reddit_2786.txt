Which IT job has the highest earning and job prospect out of the three ahead of me?
I’m looking for guidance from seasoned IT professionals about the career paths ahead of me. 

I got laid off due to COVID and I’m wondering how to best prepare for the post COVID opportunities. I have time now to sharpen some skills.

Background:
Bachelors in Economics
Masters in International Relations 

I got dragged into the tech world a few years ago (after several years of completely unrelated experience).

During the period of employment, I started working more and more in tech related roles. It was a start up and so I wore several different hats. 

Here is a rough breakdown of responsibilities:

- 5% QA (writing test cases, assigning tickets, creating QA timelines)

- 15% Product management (wireframe, get client requirements, talk and design with engineers)

- 30% operations (writing SQL queries - Oracle/SQL server, building tableau dashboards) 

- 30% data analytics (creating segments, data cleaning, regressions - mostly in Excel, R)

- 20% random stuff 

Questions:

1)Out of these, which do you believe has a higher earning potential over time?

Data Analyst 

Product management/BA

Operations Analyst 

2)How important is it to get IT qualifications / certificates to be employed by larger companies? Since my formal education is unrelated to IT, I feel like my resume may be over looked.
