MEYERLING: What happened here?
ANNE MARIE: The radio's on the fritz.
MEYERLING: Where'd you say Eric is?
ANNE MARIE: Somewhere along the pipeline.
MEYERLING: What about that hotheaded marshal, Sam Wilder? I heard he was in the middle of this mess.
ANNE MARIE: Sam? We haven't seen him.
MEYERLING: Really. I thought maybe that was his snowmobile outside. By the way -- your truck also 'on the fritz?'
ANNE MARIE: Why?
MEYERLING: It's out by the pumping station, shot full of holes.
