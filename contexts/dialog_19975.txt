MERCEDES: What do you think my father would do if I told him I didn't want to be a lawyer anymore?
ROSA: Probably the same thing my mom would do if I got engaged... have a heart attack.
MERCEDES: So how's it going with your new roomie? What's her name?
ROSA: Betty. It's O.K. except I'm worn out. We spent all weekend looking for her doctor-boy. How can a big time heart guy leave no trace of himself?
MERCEDES: So tell her to settle for the old one in Orange County.
ROSA: She's gonna have to 'cause I'm out of ideas.
MERCEDES: Maybe we're suing him for malpractice. What's his name again?
ROSA: David Ravell.
MERCEDES: God, that sounds so familiar. Ravell, Ravell... where's he out of?
ROSA: I'm not sure now. She said he used to be over at Loma Vista. I never heard of it.
MERCEDES: Loma Vista? You mean like the guy on A Reason to Love?""
ROSA: Guess who I saw today.
BETTY: Who?
ROSA: Doctor David Ravell.
BETTY: What? Where was he?!
ROSA: ON TELEVISION!! Cut the shit, will you!
ROSA: Either you're making a fool out of me because you get off on it, or you got serious problems. Which one is it?!
BETTY: I have no idea what you're talking about.
ROSA: I'M TALKING ABOUT DAVID RAVELL!!
BETTY: Shhh! I heard you the first time.
ROSA: I spent my weekend looking for someone who does -- not -- exist. I should have been here at the hospital with my brother, but I was with you.
BETTY: If you didn't want to do it, you should have said so! Is this about gas money?
ROSA: IT'S NOT ABOUT GAS MONEY!! You have a thing for an actor on a stupid white soap opera, and we searched all over town for his character! Not the actor -- whose name is George, by the way. His character!
