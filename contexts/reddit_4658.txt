Guess I'm alone
As the title suggests, no one gets me.

Im a 16 year old male who gets mediocre grades due to the fact he doesn't study. I have no gf as no one would care about my shitty face/body or childish personality.

My own family critizises me for not studying hard enough while I wake up every day feeling like shit.

Some time ago I tried to cheer myself up and started writing 5 reasons to live every day I woke up. I can't even write two of 'em.

No one knows about this as the first time I talked about it I felt worse for the reaction of my parents and how broken they were while in treatment than the actual depression. Even if I didn't get any better, everyday I would act a little better until the psychologist said I was ok, even if I was only acting (look, one thing I'm good at. Took me 16 years to realise).

This ks my second one and the only reason I wake up everyday without ending my life is because, the only thing I really care about was what would happen to my parents if I not only died, but killed myself.

If you have read this far, just want to thank you for taking your time to read through my sh*t.

Hope you get something more entertaining to do from now on ;).

The worst part: I play videogames all day because they are the only place I feel I can be myself without anyone complaining (my parents think telling me I'm useless will help get better and want to improve myself). And they now want to take them off me saying that I play way too much. Guess it won't be long until I finally explode.
