RIKER: What the hell is happening, Worf?
WORF: It appears that someone has taken over the Environmental Control Room.
TROI: Someone...?
RIKER: The Borg. Some of them must've beamed over before we destroyed their ship. Seal off that entire deck with emergency force fields.
TROI: Wil... Data was down there.
RIKER: Mister Worf... find Data if you can, but your top priority is isolating the Borg.
