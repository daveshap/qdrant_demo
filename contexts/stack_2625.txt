Calculating percentage of overlap between 2 features from 2 different layers using ArcGIS Desktop? I have two layers. Layer 1 has features that are property/parcels with area in acres. Layer 2 has features that are wetlands/bodies of water with area in acres. I want to calculate parcels that have for example 0% wetlands, 10% wetlands, 20% wetlands, 30% wetlands etc. to 100% wetlands. How can I do this on ArcGIS Desktop? Ideally, I want to find parcels/properties that have a limited number or a limited percentage of wetland coverage.
