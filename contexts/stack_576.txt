Ubuntu 17.10 on Toshiba Chromebook no sound Hello i installed a copy of Ubuntu 17.10 in my Toshiba Chromebook 2. The installation is already complete without errors.  It's working.  Only one issue.  I can't hear anything! On setting window I can find only dummy output.  I tried alsamixer and I checked all levels and channels. In software and drivers I can't find any audio driver.  What can I do now?
