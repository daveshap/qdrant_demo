Opinion: Lower to mid middle class students have the hardest time paying for college
Not sure how well this is going to be received but here it goes anyway - 

So basically I probably won’t be able to go to any of my dream colleges because of cost, even with scholarships. I do not qualify for any grants, but my parents will 100% struggle to pay for my college, let alone my two brothers in a few years. It is kind of BS that it is just assumed that just because we are middle class we can pay for college. Most of my dream colleges are about $25,000/year, that is about a quarter of my parents income. My friends have the same problem as well, they are gonna have to deny their dream schools simply because they cannot afford them and don’t qualify for any grants. Super annoying.
