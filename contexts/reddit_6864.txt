My job laid me off with severence but is changing their minds and asking me to work for one more week to earn my severance pay. what do I do?
I was laid off from my job yesterday and was told I'd be paid through march 31st. was also told mynlast day was yesterday the 23rd. 

half way through the day, they assigned me a project and told me I had to work the rest of the day and the  I was done. and theyd still pay me. 

at the end of the day they changed their minds and said in order to get my last weeks pay, I needed to do a project for them for the next week and they moved my lay off day to the 31st. 

how would you suggest handling this? I'm so mad about it and I'm not sure what's the best way for me to get my check and not work for the week as agreed upon in the layoff conversation.
