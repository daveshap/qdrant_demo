LONGFELLOW: Huh?
HALLOR: I say we don't want to appear greedy.
LONGFELLOW: Oh. That.
LONGFELLOW: What do you think you're doing?
WALTER: Why, I'm assisting you, sir.
LONGFELLOW: Get up from there. I don't want anybody holding the ends of my pants. Get up from there!
WALTER: Yes, sir.
LONGFELLOW: Imagine that - holding the ends of my pants!
HALLOR: Mrs. Semple is entitled by law to one-third of the estate.
LONGFELLOW: And don't ever get down on your knees again, understand?
WALTER: No, sir.
LONGFELLOW: Excuse me. What did you say?
HALLOR: Mrs. Semple is entitled to one- third of the estate.
LONGFELLOW: One-third? That's about $7,000,000 isn't it?
HALLOR: Well, we didn't expect that much. I'm sure I can get her to settle quietly for one million.
