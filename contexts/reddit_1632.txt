MY ED INTERVIEWER IS A PREQUEL MEMER IM CRYING
We started a skype chat and he began off with "hello there". I smirked and said "general kenobi!" Without even thinking and he replied, "i think we're about to have a very entertaining one hour". The interview went amazingly and he said I should keep in touch with him because we're interested in the same subjects. Im so happy guys im crying.
