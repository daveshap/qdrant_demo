SHELDRAKE: Well, seems like Zanuck's got himself a baseball picture.
GILLIS: Mr. Sheldrake, I don't want you to think I thought this was going to win any Academy Award.
SHELDRAKE: Of course, we're always looking for a Betty Hutton. Do you see it as a Betty Hutton?
GILLIS: Frankly, no.
SHELDRAKE: Now wait a minute. If we made it a girls' softball team, put in a few numbers. Might make a cute musical: It Happened in the Bull Pen -- the story of a Woman.
GILLIS: You trying to be funny? -- because I'm all out of laughs. I'm over a barrel and I need a job.
SHELDRAKE: Sure, Gillis. If something should come along -
GILLIS: Along is no good. I need it now.
SHELDRAKE: Haven't got a thing.
GILLIS: Any kind of assignment. Additional Dialogue.
SHELDRAKE: There's nothing, Gillis. Not even if you were a relative.
GILLIS: Look, Mr. Sheldrake, could you let me have three hundred bucks yourself, as a personal loan?
SHELDRAKE: Could I? Gillis, last year some- body talked me into buying a ranch in the valley. So I borrowed money from the bank so I could pay for the ranch. This year I had to mortgage the ranch so I could keep up my life insurance so I could borrow on the insurance so I could pay my income tax. Now if Dewey had been elected -
GILLIS: Goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake.
