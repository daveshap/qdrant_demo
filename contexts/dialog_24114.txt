MALCOLM: Are you calling me?
ANNA: What? You don't see enough of me at the store?
MAN'S VOICE: On my way to the flea market in Amish country. Thought maybe you want to come. Show me how to buy at these things.
ANNA: I trust you... Besides, I don't know if I'm up for the Amish today. You can't curse or spit or anything around them.
