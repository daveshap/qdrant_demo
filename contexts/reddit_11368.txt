Just discovered this place, have some stuff to share if anyone wants to listen...
Prepare for a wall of text ladies and gentlemen..

My name is Jake. I'm currently 17. i live with my father on the weekdays and my mother on the weekends. I currently have been in a relationship for 1 year and 9 months. My current girlfriend is pregnant. Our baby is due November 20th. Yesterday, my step mom told my dad she needed a break from everything and just left. She said she was only leaving for 2 days yet had enough clothes for 2 weeks. I feel like she is having an affair. My girlfriend is severely hormonal and I am doing my best to remain the best boyfriend I can be and yet she is always mad at me. I have tendinitis in my left shoulder and knee. I am taking the antidepressant Celexa to help with depression. There is so much stuff going on in my life that has got my mind reeling and I'm worried and scared of everything.
