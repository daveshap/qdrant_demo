I've been repeatedly told I'm doomed and hopeless after being out of the workforce for 16 years. Is this really true? [ pls no bully :( I come in total peace and humility ]
Thanks for clicking on my post!

So here's some information for you in case you're willing to point me in some useful directions. Thanks in advance for reading and thinking about a stranger's troubles and foibles.

I have a foreign degree in economics but I don't remember any of the coursework and I'm not good at it anyway. I wasn't good at economic theory and belief systems back then either. Plus I had little to no idea about what to do during exams because the questions made little sense to me. I was far better at understanding business and some finance concepts from a few of the classes I had to take. I grasped them intuitively much better than my classmates who did well at economics.

I haven't worked in 16 years. I'm afraid I will not be getting into the how and why of how this transpired. Please rest assured however that there is no incarceration or any other type of untoward/illegal/immoral/scandalous issue involved whatsoever.

What I have been doing - as and when I could - is taking many for-credit courses online at community colleges and a local 4 year college. I've been taking them as a non-degree seeking student. These classes have been in business and law, as well as in art and design. I have also taken non-college non-credit classes in art. I have excelled at all these classes.

My past jobs, before the 16 year period of unemployment, involved customer service and low-level admin work. I realized that I have a peculiar talent for observation of customer behavior and a strong curiosity about its patterns, going so far as to conduct little sensory experiments to see what customers responded to. I also found myself fixing hold-ups in customer service and employee performance with little basic solutions such as a flow-chart, behind the counter for the cashiers, that described types of glitches that the ancient cash machine would throw at us while checking out a customer and how to work around those glitches. 

Ideally, if I had the money and time that I needed, I would be studying human perception and sensory processing, and applying it toward usability, UI/UX work, interaction design, service design, customer experience design etc. But alas, I do not have that time and/or money :/ I am curious about studying these fields in Germany though given its free education and the quality of German design. But since I have no idea how to get there, it remains a total fantasy at this point.

What I can do as proven by the coursework I've excelled at:

- Write a fairly decent essay

- Analyze a given situation fairly decently

- Grasp legal concepts and apply them to scenarios (while being unable to memorize - please see section below)

- Understand at least fairly well how the fields of business and law work with each other

- Understand visual composition 

- Convey visual information

- Take on complicated topics in business, science and design and find a way to synthesize them and produce a fairly decent design product
 
This semester I will be learning how to write a business plan.

What I CANNOT do:

- Drive

- Stand for longer than 30 minutes. Walking is totally fine.

- Lift heavy objects

- Do math calculations quickly or in my head

- Memorize a ton of stuff and recall it quickly

- Speak Spanish - which in my town at least is a definite requirement for any and all menial jobs and even many white-collar low-level jobs

CAVEATS:

- The law classes have NOT been from any law school and I'm NOT working towards a JD or any paralegal certification. (Should I?) They're from community colleges.

- I do NOT have any training whatsoever in design software such as Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator etc. 

- I do NOT have any training whatsoever in commonly used office software like MS Office.

If you've read thus far, here are some questions:

- Ideally I would have a remote/online part-time job.  What fields would such jobs fall under? What skills do such jobs often require?

- What should I learn in the short term so I have basic job skills for a white-collar job? 

(I'm not seeking white-collar out of classism or snobbery, please see 'What I CANNOT do section' above)

- What should I aim for in the long term so that I can build career skills while I work a part-time job?

- What kind of job should I be looking for while I build larger, long-term career skills?

- Do you have any pointers on what type of career I should go for? 

CODING BOOTCAMP:

At this point, it seems like standard advice to tell someone to 'get into' a coding bootcamp. Is this a reasonable course of action for someone like me?

Thank you VERY much for reading thus far! If all you have to say is that I'm doomed and hopeless, I request that you not bother saying it. I look forward to your suggestions and advice. Thanks again.
