WOOLRIDGE: But, here's the thing. He'll only talk to you. He doesn't want you to ask him anything. And you shouldn't stare at him.
MARSHA: How am I going to conduct an interview if I can't ask him any questions?
WOOLRIDGE: It's the best you're gonna get. I'm sorry.
MARSHA: Can I ask you a question? If he's so troubled, why are you letting him out? What if he does it again? It happens all the time.
WOOLRIDGE: He's free. His time's up. That's the rules. He's been treated and reevaluated. He doesn't show any signs any more.
MARSHA: Signs?
WOOLRIDGE: Homicidal signs. Oh, we're gonna change the light in here for Karl. I hope you can see to write.
