UTAH: Oh well he must be a surfer.
PAPPAS: Shutup, you might learn somethin' you're not careful... So last year Nixon scuffs a counter going over. There was a soil sample. Non- specific mud traces of asphalt, oils, blah, blah... sand and... carnuba wax. So I became a wax expert. There's 80 some uses for this stuff, something like five hundred products.
UTAH: Candle wax. Car wax. Mustache wax? Could be anything. Guy's waxing his mustache at the beach. Gets sand in it. Wipes it off with a shoe. Shoe scuffs the counter.
PAPPAS: The lab made three possible matches, this was one of 'em.
UTAH: Sex wax? You're not into kinky shit, are you Angelo?
PAPPAS: Surfers use it on their boards. They rub sand into it for traction.
UTAH: Thanks for the tip. I needed this knowledge.
