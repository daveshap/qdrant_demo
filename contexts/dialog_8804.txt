ARTHUR: I am alone and betrayed. By my wife, by my beloved friend, by my knights. And by you. Perhaps most of all by you. For you made me, you forged this wretched life. And like a child tired of a toy, you toss me aside, a babbling lecher trotting after my sister...
MERLIN: That is my destiny. I have a destiny, too...
ARTHUR: With all your powers, you are content to be ridiculed, laughed at...
MERLIN: My powers fade, Arthur. I resort to cheap tricks... Yes! I enjoy every moment of my foolishness, I join in the making of it, so no one can betray me. But you! You betray yourself.
ARTHUR: Me? I have lived by the oath of king and knight.
MERLIN: You betray the boy who drew the sword, the boy who saw the Dragon... the Dragon who moves close by, coiling and uncoiling, restless, looking down, waiting for the King to be a king...
ARTHUR: I must do it myself. I must kill them both. Lancelot and Guenevere. Will you ride with me, Merlin?
MERLIN: I cannot. I must not. Here I must stay.
