If Rosenstein is fired, what are the established procedures for replacing him and what effect does replacing him have on the ongoing special counsel investigation?
I'm curious about the legal options if Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein is fired this week.


As I understand it, since [AG Jeff Sessions recused himself](http://time.com/4689877/recuses-meaning-jeff-sessions-donald-trump/), [Rosenstein alone has the sole legal authority](https://www.factcheck.org/2017/06/can-trump-fire-mueller/) to fire Mueller or end the probe. Is this correct?


[If Rosenstein is fired,](https://www.wsj.com/articles/deputy-attorey-general-rod-rosenstein-expects-to-be-fired-monday-1537801806) how is the Deputy AG spot filled from a legal perspective? Is it an appointment by the President or Jeff Sessions? Is it somebody who was one rung down from Rosenstein on the org structure like an Assistant Deputy AG or something?
