MR. WILLIS: Hello... ...hey Denise... what, what's wrong, did you break down?
DENISE: No, nothing like that... yeah, we're gonna be a little late. We stopped for gas at this place called Capt. Spaulding's outside of Ruggsville and it turned into a whole thing, so we're kind of behind schedule.
MR. WILLIS: Oh yeah, yeah I've driven by that place before. I seem to remember a crabby old bastard in a crummy clown suit running the place.
DENISE: Yeah, well he's still here. I think him and Jerry are fast becoming buddies, you know Jerry... yeah, he's gotta see everything... yeah, I know... thinks there's some unsolved mystery around every corner.
MR. WILLIS: Well, don't take too long, the kids are already knocking down the door demanding their sugar fix... I know, I know I forgot to mention that Halloween falls on a school night, so they're trick or treating tonight... I got the joint decked out this year, built a graveyard in the front yard like when you were a kid.
DENISE: Hopefully I can move things along here and make up the lost time by speeding all the way home... yes, Dad I'm kidding.
MR. WILLIS: Well, just promise me you'll be careful... alright, alright see ya soon... good-bye.
JERRY: I'm gonna go ask him.
MARY: Aw, come on Jerry. We've gotten all we're gonna get out of this place and its starting to rain.
JERRY: Shit, it is only sprinkling and it's worth the trouble. Hold on for two seconds.
