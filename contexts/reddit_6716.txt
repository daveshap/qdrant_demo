Multiple Recruiters For Company I Applied For?
This is my second time applying for the same position and the first time I had a different recruiter who has now moved up the corporate ladder. 

It’s been almost 2 weeks since I’ve submitted my application, the job posting has been open for a month and I have two inside sources that say that the position desperately needs to be filled. 

I’d like to give the process a boost, if I could, to try and score an interview, but I don’t know which recruiter to email.  They have 3 listed on LinkedIn that reside in the headquarters location but usually one is specific to a certain branch though I have no idea who it is. 

They have a Senior Recruiter, a Lead Recruiter, and a Junior Recruiter. Which one should I go for if any?
