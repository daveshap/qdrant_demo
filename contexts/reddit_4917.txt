The world is a terrible place and life is not worth living
On a larger scale. I don't understand how people look at humanity and see something worthy. The world is a cesspool. Humans are filth.  

On a smaller scale.    
I don't understand how people find interacting with others fulfilling, instead of draining.    
I don't understand why people would want another person sleeping next to them, taking their free time, always being around them, bothering them.  

I don't understand how people take the small portion of the day that they spend not working, sleeping or commuting, and find the time and willpower to do anything social or productive with it.    
I don't understand why people are ambitious, why they strive to gain status or money.    
I don't understand why people work out or eat healthy. I've tried it many times, for long periods. I've had good health and a healthy, fit body.    
I felt worse, felt drained by spending my limited free time on doing something I don't enjoy, and eating (one of my few pleasures) things that didn't give me a spike of dopamine. I felt no joy at being 'attractive'. I still felt tired, still felt like my body was slowly dying.  

  
The tiny, tiny spike of pleasure at achieving something that I set out to do is NOTHING. It's shorter and less enjoyable than, say, the pleasure of hearing a really funny joke.    
Whenever I manage to achieve something that is supposed to help my depression, all I can think about is how empty it was, how I wasted my time forcing myself to suffer through something I hated doing.  

  
I've tried medications. It works for a while and then I get used to it, it stops working.    
The more of them I try, the less effective it seems. The first one lasted a while.    
It's hard to remember what it's like, but I do remember thinking how beautiful the sunset was, how golden the sun. I remember having more energy.    
I don't think I'm every getting that back.
