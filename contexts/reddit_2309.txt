So I'm the Valedictorian...
My school just called me this morning and said I'm officially the valedictorian and I have to send my counselor my speech by this evening at 5 PM :/

Do you guys have any ideas about what I should write about?  I'm somewhat lost as I'm not a good writer and I have about 6 hours left to write this speech.  I'm considering writing/mentioning a few school trends, some meme references, and subtlety criticising my school's admin team (there's no communication from the faculty to the students, a lot of the admin look down on us and give us an attitude, and disregard our opinions when we try to voice them).
