A fundamental question about charge and speed of a particle Hi everybody and happy 2019. In my teaching sessions sometimes someone asks questions i cannot truly answer (although i have many arguments on it) and here's one that really puzzles me:<blockquote>  A massless (real) particle moves at $c$; now, since electric charge is always  associated with the presence of mass, if you move at $c$ you cannot  carry any electric charge, nevertheless you can still carry color charge, why?</blockquote>I think that a more fundamental question for this would be to ask why if you are massless you actually must move at speed $c$ plus to understand the nature of the e.m. interaction and strong force one. Any help to give my student an answer that is not a labirynth of theorical burning hell?The point here is not if charged massless particle can or cannot exist but if in principle this apply to all kind of charges (e.g. elecrtic, color, etc.) that is to say if the property of a filed of self-interaction is somehow necessarely linked to the property of having no mass (or alternatively spin 0)
