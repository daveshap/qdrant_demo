My birthday.
I know this is a selfish post since there are lots and lots of people that face way more severe consequences due to the virus, but I just had to write this sonewhere.       

In the last couple of years I've lost a lot of friends because I moved away and they slowly startes never texting/calling/whatever again. I wasn't ever able to really make new friends because I'm anxious and I have a lot of special interest hobbies. The loss of nearly all of my friendships hurt me for the past couple of years.       

Every year when my birthday came, I felt outright depressed for 2 weeks. I knew it would only be me and my girlfriend and maybe my parents and/or hers for a visit. As someone who always had fun birthday parties with some good friends I felt lonely every year. Especially since my birthday is something I'm excited about which not all people can relate to.          

This year, I was finally somewhat over it. I knew I wouldn't hear from many people and there were actually more than I thought. My colleagues which I like very much were especially good for me. You can't call them 'friends' but at least they were thinking of me. We would also always do some small party when we had our teem meeting.        

Now, Covid-19 hit and we basically have quarantine in Germany. Not really, but pretty much. So we moved our  team meeting to online and I can't see anyone, not even my parents or well, my colleagues. My birthday was yesterday and I've seen no one and will see no one except my girlfriend until... I don't know.        

Now the sadness has kicked in again and I'm sitting on my kitchen, crying because again, I feel so lonely. Just due to this fucking virus.
