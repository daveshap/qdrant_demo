EMIL: Do you know how much killer gets for movie rights?
VENDOR: In here, says he wants a million.
EMIL: Million?! The killer gets one million dollars for a television interview?
VENDOR: Hey, tabloids paid Ted Bundy - famous serial killer - half a million for his interview. And how much you think Monica got for writing book about the President coming on to her? It pays to be a killer or a whore in this country. Look, you want magazine or not?
EMIL: Yes. Both.
