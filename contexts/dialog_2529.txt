MARTY: ...He just lets himself get pushed around all the time! People walk all over him and he never fights back, never stands up for himself.
SUZY: No self confidence, I guess... At least you don't take after him.
MARTY: Yeah... Jesus! I wonder how he ever got up enough nerve to marry my mom.
SUZY: Can you imagine your parents in bed together?
MARTY: No way!
SUZY: Me neither. I've always wondered whether they slept together before they got married. You think yours did?
MARTY: Hell no! The way my mom carries on about sex -- you even mention the word and she goes into cardiac arrest. You shoulda seen her face when I told her we were gonna stay up all night Saturday, he added. Always afraid something is going to happen.
SUZY: Is something going to happen Saturday night?
