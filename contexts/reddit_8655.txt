Does the reversal of the elephant trophy ban help or hinder conservation efforts long term?
[The Trump administration has ended a ban on elephant trophies from Zimbabwe.](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-reverses-obama-era-ban-on-import-of-elephant-trophies-from-zimbabwe/)

On the one hand, [as hunters argue](http://www.cnn.com/2014/01/16/us/black-rhino-hunting-permit/index.html), sanctioned hunts can be auctioned off to raise substantial amounts of money for conservation efforts, and the ability to bring home trophies  can make this more appealing for wealthy hunters.

On the other hand, [poaching is still a significant threat to elephant populations](https://cites.org/eng/news/pr/2016_trends_in_African_elephant_poaching_released_â€“_CITES_MIKE_programme_03032017) and legalizing the import of trophies could expand the perceived market for poachers in America, giving them further motivation.

Given that both of these arguments are at least *feasible*, if not necessarily reality, what evidence is there as to what the net effect will be on elephant populations?

Edit: Additionally, according to the US Fish and Wildlife Service, [trophy bans are based in part by the US determining that these countries were not adequately contributing to conservation efforts](https://www.fws.gov/international/permits/by-activity/sport-hunted-trophies-elephants.html). This could be due to corruption in the local government purposefully auctioning more hunting rights than is sustainable, or auctioning off elephants which still have the capacity to breed.
