High School (more specifically the people at it) makes me suicidal as f*ck.
Whoever said high school is the best 4 years of your life is so full of shit. I have never met more fake, toxic, useless, worthless people than at my school. Some of these people make it their life mission to make everyone around them as miserable as possible, just for a quick laugh out of their friend group. I legitimately fantasize about murdering some of these people almost daily. I know I would never follow through with these thoughts, but it's still scary I even have them. Fuck I really just want to off myself, but I can't do that to the people around me. Could I just get hit by a car or get terminal cancer or something?? Why the hell am I even forced to go to school??!?! I don't mean to sound like an intellectual or anything, but I have learned loads more useful stuff from just googling shit I'm curious about, than memorizing bullshit in a classroom. Quarantine has been a dream come true, really. I never want this summer to end, every school year just gets worse and worse. It'll be a miracle if i make it through the next 2 years.
