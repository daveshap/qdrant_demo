Temporarily laid off but was told to “find something else”
I’m a college student finishing her last year. I’ve been at the same company for 3 years work as a graphic designer but mainly as a digital press operator.

Due to class this semester I was only working 8 hours a week. It wasn’t until March 23rd that I was told not to come in due to the lack of work. Understandable. At the end of it, I personally wanted to quit and move on to a graphic design position at an advertising agency. I never wanted to go down like this on these terms (uncontrollable situation, I know).

I filed for unemployment recently due to my busy schedule and have been getting money that way. I texted one of my coworkers who is one of the higher-ups I guess you could say and engages in what is called a manager’s meeting. Thursday I had asked when there is an expected due date for return. He said the following:


“We have no date in mind.  There just is not enough work. I would try to find something else.”

With that being said, I said thank you for the update. I haven’t given it much thought up until now. I plan on talking to my other coworker to see if I can get some other insight but it’s late so it’ll be pushed till some time tomorrow possibly. She is still working as a digital press operator except she is full time/has kids/etc. So I can understand why she still has her job but I don’t technically.

I didn’t quit but I feel I have lost my job completely but I do not have any guarantee on that. Not fired, just let go. I’m unsure of who to talk to, what to discuss, and how to go about this. Any advice will be helpful.
