WEST: Cadet, what's your name!
DUNBAR: Sir, Dunbar, sir!
WEST: You know how to work a pistol, Dunbar?
DUNBAR: Sir, yes, sir!
WEST: Dunbar you are to stand here and guard this nigger for the next twenty- four hours! He is not to be given food, water, or clothes! If he so much as moves, you are to blow his nigger brains out, is that clear?
DUNBAR: Sir, yes, sir!
WEST: The rest of you, fallout for physicals!
