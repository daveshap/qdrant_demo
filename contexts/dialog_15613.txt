MAURICE: Well, hello.
ISAAC: I'm Isaac... I'm three.
MAURICE: I'm Maurice Parker... I'm much older than three. Are your parents home?
ISAAC: You know what, I can play baseball with my brothers when I'm bigger.
MAURICE: Is that right?
ISAAC: You know what... I'm just little now, but I'll be big soon.
MAURICE: You'll probably be bigger than your brothers.
ISAAC: Yeah!
