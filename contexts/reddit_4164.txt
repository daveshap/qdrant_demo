PAY ATTENTION TO THE SIGNS AND LEARN TO LET GO
If the person youâ€™re dating is showing red flags, leaves you on read, left suddenly, not valuing you, etc. it is a sign. Whether it be from the universe/God/whichever religion you are, it is a sign that the person is not good for you and you dodged a bullet of potential heartbreak. THEY ARE NOT THE RIGHT ONE. There will be someone else who can love and make you happier. Learn to let go and live on. Remain calm and keep your peace.
