SHINZON: You can't trace my holographic emitters, Captainn. So don't bother. And you can't contact Starfleet. We're quite alone.
PICARD: We are.
SHINZON: It's just the two of us now, Jean Luc, as it should be... Your ship and mine... You and me.
PICARD: Why are you here?
SHINZON: To accept your surrender. I can clearly destroy you at any time. Lower your shields and allow me to transport you to my ship.
PICARD: And what of the Enterprise?
SHINZON: I have little interest in your quaint vessel, Captain. If the Enterprise will withdraw to a distance of one hundred light years, it will not be harmed.
PICARD: You know that's not possible.
SHINZON: I know... you'll all gladly die to save your home world.
PICARD: Look at me, Shinzon! Do you feel the blood pumping inside you? Your hands, your eyes, your nature, are the same as mine. Buried deep inside you beneath the years of pain and anger is a capacity you've forgotten. It's the one way our mirror can reflect the two of us exactly because it's the very thing that truly defines us. To be human is to try to make yourself better than you are.
PICARD: I know you as well as I know myself, Shinzon. There was a time you looked at the stars and dreamed of what might be.
SHINZON: Long ago.
PICARD: Not so long.
SHINZON: Childish dreams, Captain. Lost in the dilithium mines of Remus. I'm what you see now.
PICARD: I see more than what you are.
