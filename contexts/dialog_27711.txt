MACFARLANE: Was the paralysis immediate?
MRS. MARSH: No, Doctor. She seemed to get better, then about six months later she began to complain of pain in her back --
MACFARLANE: How long after that was the paralysis complete?
MRS. MARSH: Nearly a year.
MACFARLANE: Any attacks of pain since?
MRS. MARSH: Yes, Doctor.
MACFARLANE: Is her pain sporadic or constant?
MRS. MARSH: It comes at intervals. They used to be months apart -- but they've been growing more frequent -- much more frequent.
MACFARLANE: See here, child, when you have this pain in your back, where is it?
