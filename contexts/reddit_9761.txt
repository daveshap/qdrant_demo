Student organization making money on school's campus using school's name, hiding profits from school. I don't think it's money laundering, but could the school sue us? (x-post from r/legaladvice)
I work for a campus organization that hosts events that bring in 100k+ each year. Usually that money goes into our school account but the school limits how we spend that money. We recently set up a 501c3 non-profit and now about half of our revenue goes into that account (conference attendees pay directly to the non-profit rather than the school). That non-profit-- the board is made up of young alumni-- then buys us things that the school would otherwise regulate like plane tickets, vendor contracts, etc.
My concern is that we are making money using the school's name and the school's facilities and not declaring it in anyway. We are acting as agents of the university when we put on these conferences. While we have an account with the school, it is technically their money, right? Could the school conceivably sue the non-profit for the money that would have otherwise gone to them?
