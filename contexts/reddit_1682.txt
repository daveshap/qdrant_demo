Interviews be like
Me during my Cornell Interview:  “I love the large community at Cornell.”

*24 hours later*

Me during my Dartmouth Interview: “I love the small tight knit community at Dartmouth. Bring on the canoes!”

Edit: officially 1/8th as A2C famous as the guy who kissed his interviewer. *Note to self* The interviewer won’t care what type of community you like if you kiss them.
