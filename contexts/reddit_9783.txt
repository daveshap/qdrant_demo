Internal Interview Advice Please
I'm a finalist for a promotion in my office.  The biggest thing I'm having issues with is preparing questions.  I will meet with a search committee that is made up mostly of campus partners, my whole department, the hiring manager, and the director.  I plan on asking the search committee how they envision themselves working with this position, but that's all I've got.  What are your favorite internal interview questions to ask when YOU are the candidate?
