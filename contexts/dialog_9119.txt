REED: Back it down, Johnny!
JOHNNY: I can go hotter!
JOHNNY: You're really cramping my style here.
SUE: You were at 4000 Kelvin. Any hotter, you're approaching supernova --
JOHNNY: Sweet.
SUE: That's the temperature of the sun.
REED: Not only could you kill yourself, but you could set fire to Earth's atmosphere and destroy all human life as we know it.
JOHNNY: Gotcha. Okay. Supernova bad.
