I accidentally landed a job with a fortune 500 company. How can I succeed in this strange corporate world?
What are your tips to surviving in a corporate environment?

I left a job I was unhappy with two months ago for  what seemed like a dream job. 25k annually to 55k salary. Well, that turned into a huge mistake and I was let go after six weeks*.

I felt lost at this point, funds depleted, motivation and drive gone. After a few weeks and countless applications to dead end jobs, I drunkenly must have applied to a fairly high end corporate job in my field. 

Some days later I ended up having a phone interview and a week later an in person interview. There were 6 other candidates, some with 4 year degrees and myself with no degree but some experience with the role.

Long story short, I landed the job...

What tips, advice, or other info can you give on making it in this world? Is a business casual dress code that bad? How do I keep my peaceful, hippy soul from being crushed by country club, jones keeper-uppers?
