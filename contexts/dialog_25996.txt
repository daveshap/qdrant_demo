MR SCOTT: Hello, Vi.
VI: What are you doing here?
MR SCOTT: What are you doing here?
VI: I'm sorry. I didn't mean, I just didn't expect to run into you here, that's all.
MR SCOTT: Well, now you have.
VI: Yeah, um, then...are you alone?
MR SCOTT: Uh huh.
VI: Can I join you?
MR SCOTT: You're not.
VI: Good. 'Cause I...um...I really agreed with everything you had to say last week about how bad my story was...
MR SCOTT: That's good.
VI: And I also agreed with what you said today about Marcus's story. It is a piece of shit.
MR SCOTT: You have beautiful skin.
VI: Thank you. So Catherine seems like she might become a really good writer.
MR SCOTT: Maybe. She's OK.
VI: Aren't you going out with Catherine? I'm sorry. It's none of my business. I didn't mean...
MR SCOTT: I'm not 'going out' with Catherine.
VI: Oh. Do you think I have a potential as a writer?
MR SCOTT: No.
VI: Thank you for being honest.
