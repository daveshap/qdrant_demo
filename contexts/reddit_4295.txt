Sometimes I can't believe what a small world it is...
So a week or two ago I matched up with a girl on Bumble and we started talking. She seemed really sweet and she's really pretty, so I decided to ask her out.

We met up today and realized we live in the same town. Then we realized she takes her pets to the animal hospital I work at part-time (used to be full-time until I switched to human medicine). Then we realized we live just a few houses away from eachother and were laughing about it for the rest of the date. We've both lived just a few houses away from eachother for our entire lives and never got to meet until today! She went to private school and I went to public school, so that's why haha. Luckily she was pretty awesome and we're both REALLY excited for our next date, otherwise it would've been ultra awkward. We were laughing about how bad it would've been if we both drove home from the coffee shop where we met up and thought we were following eachother home.

I'm so happy! I know it was just a first date and it may not mean much, but I don't think I've ever clicked so well with someone on a first date and that revelation just added so much to it! And it's hilarious to think about the fact that I've been at her doorstep when trick-or-treating, have waved to her parents sometimes when driving past her house, and have spoken to her grandmother in the past. I can't believe I had never seen her!

Well, that's my story haha. It doesn't contribute much, but it put a big smile on my face today and I thought I'd share. :) I hope a lot of my fellow r/dating redditors had something good happen to them today!
