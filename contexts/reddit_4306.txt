I have alopecia and I feel like I'm going to die alone because of it
24 f 
Had alopecia since I was 13. It's where you're immune system rejects your hair so I've basically been bald since middle school. I'm otherwise healthy,  just no hair.

No guy has ever shown genuine interest me. Heck it's even hard to make decent friends because of it. I'm not attractive enough for people. I cry a lot because of it. Sometimes I think what's the point of living if I'm going to feel like this forever.

edit: I'm so overwhelmed by all of the support guys. I'm never deleting this post and will always look at it when I'm feeling down. All of your comments are so helpful! Thankyou!
