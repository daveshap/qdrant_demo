KATE: Well...Annie for one.
JACK: Surprise. We’re pregnant... Yeah...that must’ve been...I mean that was very unexpected. But what are you gonna do, right?
KATE: I think it worked out okay, don’t you?
JACK: Sure. I really like Annie.
KATE: Good, Jack. Maybe we’ll keep her.
JACK: No, I love Annie. We had a lot of good times, didn’t we?
KATE: We were young... Remember that little place on Charles Street we used to go to?
JACK: Charles Street? In the Village? When we were living in Greenwich Village...? Great times. Why’d we ever leave?
KATE: You can’t really raise a kid in an apartment in the Village...
KATE: The trek out to the hospital every day didn’t help either... You were great. Surviving the heart attack was one thing...
JACK: You had a heart attack?
KATE: Jack, stop that. I'm still mad at you... ...who knows what would’ve happened if you hadn’t stepped in at the store.
JACK: That’s why I work for Big Ed?
