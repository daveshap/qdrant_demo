Extremely bad feelings about new job
So it's been a little more than a week and I may sound like I'm complaining too much so early on but I have extremely bad feelings about my job. I just graduated as a finance major, and right before graduating I had major anxiety about finding a job in the first place. So I basically took what I could find.  The job that I took has nothing been awful from the start. First they tried to go against my vacation request even though they agreed to it previously. Secondly they surprised me by making me travel my first week of the job and all my managers bailed on me so I had to go on it alone and take care of the whole business trip myself. And lastly, the job is not what was described to me at all. I was described an extremely analytical position (position is called financial analyst) but it turns out that all the cool stuff in the interview that my manager told me I would get to work on is not happening. The reality is that I'm just doing manual data entry all day and there's no analysis to be done at all. I'm basically handling mail and physical papers and inputting it into a system. I'm really an individual looking to do mentally stimulating work. I want to learn but unfortunately I'm not learning a single thing at all. What would you do in this situation? Should I continue to give it another chance and just work? Or should I look for another job and keep this one off my CV as the experience is too short. Any advice would be most welcome, thank you all very much.
