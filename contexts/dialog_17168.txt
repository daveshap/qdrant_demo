GEORGE: Did your -- doctor say it's okay for you to go back to work?
ANDY: Ehhh, you know those guys. If he had his way, I'd be stuck in the hospital, running tests all day. And anyway, I've found a new guy who's gonna be able to instantly remove the cancer.
GEORGE: Really?
ANDY: Yeah! He's a psychic surgeon in the Philippines, and he's amazing! He rubs you and sucks the disease right out!
