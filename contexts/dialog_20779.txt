JOE: Mr. Laird, when I approached you about being a witness at this trial, and you agreed, you gave sworn testimony in a deposition. Is that correct?
LAIRD: That's correct.
JOE: According to the deposition, you said you were thrilled
LAIRD: I may have said something like that. But that's not how I feel at this moment.
JOE: Okay, Mr. Laird. Explain this to me like I'm a four year old: Did Andrew Beckett win your lawsuit for you or not?
LAIRD: We won.
JOE: Did that thrill, impress and overwhelm you?
LAIRD: It satisfied me.
JOE: It's a long way between being overwhelmed and being satisfied. A cheeseburger may be satisfying whereas caviar and champagne and roast duck and baked Alaska for dessert might be considered overwhelming. Do you agree?
LAIRD: I might.
JOE: Five months ago you characterized Andrew Beckett as caviar and now you're calling him a cheeseburger. Your standards have shifted a great deal, and I'd like to know why you've changed your mind.
LAIRD: Since that time I've devoted more thought to the subject, and that's how I feel now.
