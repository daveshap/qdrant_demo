I got rejected from Uchicago and waitlisted at Colby today but the cashier at noodles & co made my day
I went to noodles & co after I got my decisions from these two schools today and I was pretty down. They guy noticed and asked if I was good, and I told him I didn’t get into some colleges, and he was like “hold up I got you” and gave me a free large drink, free cookies, gave me extra everything, and made a $16 order $4 for me. I hugged that man. Be nice to people man it really makes ppls days

We’re all going to make it❤️❤️ god is good

edit: got into pomona!!!!
