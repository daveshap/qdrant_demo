BETSY: But I'm Miss Jessica's nurse, Alma. You don't have to do that for me.
ALMA: I know, miss. But I like to do it. I like to tend for Miss Jessica and I want to tend for you. You settle right back, now, and I'll mix you your coffee.
BETSY: Thank you, Alma.
ALMA: Miss Jessica used to say this is the only way for a lady to break her fast -- in bed, with a lacy cushion to bank her head up. If you'd only seen her, Miss Connell. She looked so pretty.
BETSY: She must have been beautiful. What happened to her, Alma?
ALMA: She was very sick and then she went mindless, Miss.
BETSY: We'll see if we can't make her well, Alma, you and I.
ALMA: I do my best. Every day I dress her just as beautifully as if she was well. It's just like dressing a great, big doll.
BETSY: What's this?
ALMA: A puff-up, I call it. But Miss Jessica always says brioche.""
BETSY: Looks like an awful lot of breakfast -- I don't know whether I'll be able to get away with it.
HOLLAND: I made it clear in my letter to the company. This is not a position for a frightened girl.
BETSY: I am not a frightened girl.
HOLLAND: That's hard to believe, after what happened last night.
BETSY: If I were as timid as you seem to think, Mr. Holland, I wouldn't have gone into the tower in the first place.
HOLLAND: And what is so alarming about the tower, Miss Connell?
BETSY: Nothing -- really. But you must admit it's an eerie sort of place -- so dark --
HOLLAND: Surely nurses aren't afraid of the dark?
BETSY: Of course not!
HOLLAND: A mental case?
BETSY: I'm sorry...
HOLLAND: Why should you be? My wife is a mental case. Please keep that in mind, Miss Connell -- particularly when some of the foolish people of this island start talking to you about Zombies.
