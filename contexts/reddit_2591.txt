I’m doing a bad job because I suddenly got sick. I’m terrified it will ruin my career. How can I ask for help when I’ve only been in the job so briefly?
I have an autoimmune hyperthyroid disorder that has greatly affected me the past two months. Medication is no longer working and I’m doing very poorly at work. 

Most days my heart rate is 105 -130. I’m confused a lot, anxious, and distracted. I cannot think critically, organize my thoughts, or do the analytics I need to be successful in this job, no matter how I try. I’m lucky my workload is light at this time due to the current COVID situation.  I hope to have surgery to remove my thyroid in June but in the mean time, I’m stuck like this

This job is high level and if I fuck it up, the industry is small and I’m not sure if my reputation would recover. I just started my job in January and had my disease go haywire in February. Quitting is not an option due to health insurance and a relocation repayment agreement of $20k.

At the interview, I presented as a smart and capable person. Now I feel I can barely think of words to say. I feel 100% incapable of making good recommendations and business decisions. It took me a full day to comprehend and complete a simple task. I have chest pains and unexplained anxiety daily. It’s serious and I feel my reputation is tarnished if I don’t get time to get better. 

I’m exploring my options for leave but I’m terrified of the repercussions. How can I speak to my boss? I’m terrified of being fired in the COVID-19 environment and being left without health insurance. It would potentially ruin my career as well. Should I speak to HR first?
