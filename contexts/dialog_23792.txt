MILES: First take your glass and examine the wine against the light. You're looking at color and clarity.
JACK: What color is it supposed to be?
MILES: Depends on the varietal. Just get a sense of it. Thick? Thin? Watery? Syrupy? Inky? Amber, whatever...
JACK: Huh.
MILES: Now tip it. What you're doing here is checking for color density as it thins toward the rim. Tells you how old it is, among other things, usually more important with reds. This is a very young wine, so it's going to retain its color pretty solidly. Now stick your nose in it.
