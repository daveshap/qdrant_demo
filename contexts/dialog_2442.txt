O'NEILL: Rick, I'm concerned.
RICK: About what?
O'NEILL: This is your bachelor party. You haven't had sex with anyone yet.
RICK: Get a few drinks into me, we'll dance and see what happens.
O'NEILL: I got something you can't resist. I have a friend, Tracey. She wants to meet you. She loves to please.
RICK: Oooooo.
O'NEILL: Right in there, pal.
RICK: If I'm not out in a half hour, send for the paramedics.
O'NEILL: That's the old Rick!
