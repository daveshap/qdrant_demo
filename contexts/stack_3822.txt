test if two linear fits are different I have time-dependent data from experiments done by two different labs. Lab1 has measurements at 60 different time-points. Lab2 has measurements at 40 different time-points (within the same range as Lab1 but not exactly the same time-points). I fitted the splines for data from Lab1 and Lab2. The curves look very similar. I would like to test if the fits/data are significantly different. I would like to answer the question if the difference between the results from both labs is statistically significant. What type of test I should use?
