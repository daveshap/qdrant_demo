“I’m always here if you need to talk”
I appreciate the programmed sentence you feel obligated to tell me, so you can feel better about yourself. 

The reality is, so many people can you tell you there here for you - but they’re not, I’m sorry but they’re not. 

I don’t feel comfortable telling anyone “hey they’re back, the thoughts are back and they’re stronger each time” 

I couldn’t even tell my therapist the truth depth, I can tell her I have thoughts sure, that they linger - always. If I tel her, I get “you’re not going to though, right” - it feels like a trick question. What relieves them though? I meditate, I journal, I do yoga, I exercise, I have lovely friends and family, I take my meds, I drink water - but they’re there. 

When does it end?
