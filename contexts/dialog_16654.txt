LENA: So what's going on with the Spring Dance? You have a date yet?
MONICA: Yeah, brothers are lined up at my locker.
LENA: I found you someone.
MONICA: Found? I'm not some charity case.
LENA: I know...
MONICA: Mom tell you to do this?
LENA: No.
MONICA: Damn, Lena... Who is he?
LENA: This brother from my college.
MONICA: He's in college?
LENA: And he's fine, girl.
MONICA: How'd you get him to say yes?
LENA: I told him you looked like me.
MONICA: Oh, great.
LENA: You do.
MONICA: Yeah, right.
LENA: If you were tore up I would not be claiming you. Trust.
MONICA: I don't know how to walk in heels.
LENA: Hey. You just worry about playing your behind off for that recruiter tonight. Let me worry about your date.
MONICA: You ever been in love?
LENA: Too many times.
MONICA: They ever love you back?
LENA: Yeah, once I cut them off. Why?
