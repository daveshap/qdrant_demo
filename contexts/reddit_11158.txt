Feeling very alone and abandoned
I feel very depressed and alone at the moment. I put a lot of pressure on myself to do things and I always think I'm never good enough to accomplish things. Because of this, I surround myself with people who boost my mood and make me feel good, which helps me accomplish more things. After I graduated last year my mom decided she was going to move across states leaving my dad, brother, and sister. This was not a surprise, it has been talked about for years but I never actually thought she would go through with it. My mom and I travel to FL where she finds a house. I go back home (mom stayed in FL to close the deal) and it hit me like a rock. So I started feeling depressed and leaned on my friends/SO for support. I never told them that I needed their support because I didn't want them to feel obligated into helping me. I also didn't want to tell my mom that I was depressed about her moving because her and my dad were so happy to be away from each other. Long story short I find out my best friend is leaving to move in with a guy she's been dating for only less than a month, my SO is moving about an hour away to be closer to school, and my sister just left and moved in with her SO. The house is completely empty most of the time when it use to be filled with life. It's left me feeling abandoned and alone, new feelings I'm not use to dealing with and I don't know what I can do to make myself feel better. Any words of advice would be very helpful. 

Edit: Wow! Did not expect this many responses, thank you!
