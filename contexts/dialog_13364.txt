EDDIE: Hey, how much are we ahead?
CHARLIE: Approximately? One thousand bucks.
EDDIE: Fats, let's you and I shoot a game of pool for a thousand dollars a game.
FATS: Preach! Go down and get me some White Tavern whisky, a glass, and some ice.
EDDIE: Preacher! Go on down and get me some bourbon. J. T. S. Brown. No ice, no glass.
FATS: Preach... get it at Johnny's. You got a bet.
