My best friend doesn't want me to have my crush
I have developed a crush for a girl (she is in my class), we went to a couple of party's and also slept in the same bed once, we kinda made out but nothing more but we were really drunk. She also said that she liked me but I'm not Shure if she meant it in a loving way.

So anyways I'm trying to get her to be my girlfriend but one of my best mates, who is a good friend of her but nothing more always tries to stop anything happening between me and my crush.

What should I do, should I confess my feelings to her or should I just shove it down and not do anything?
