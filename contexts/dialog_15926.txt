BARON: Fight's over before it's begun... soon the survivors will be in full retreat.
1ST DEMON: Then we smash 'em?
BARON: Anything left for smashing you may happily smash.
2ND DEMON: We watch... good fun...
BARON: Indeed, the best of fun... Enjoy yourselves.
1ST DEMON: You go? Not watch fun?
BARON: I have something far more pleasant awaiting me.
2ND DEMON: More fun win battle?
BARON: This is another victory, my friends. What began with the lash shall be concluded with a caress.
2ND DEMON: You go to lady now?
BARON: To finish last evening's delightful work.
1ST DEMON: We come watch... we come watch...
BARON: Nay. This is a private affair, no audience welcome... Better you watch the dismantling of our enemies... and, look you, see the moat is set aflame.
1ST DEMON: Fire moat... why do that?
BARON: Purely a precaution...
