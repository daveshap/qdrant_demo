HELEN: That's none of your goddamn business! What kind of questions are these?
HARRY: You're in a lot of trouble, Mrs. Tasker, so I suggest you cooperate. If we want to know the most intimate details of your life, you'd better tell us.
HELEN: My husband is a good man.
GIB: But he's not exactly ringing your bell lately, right? I mean--
HARRY: Let me handle this part. Do you mind? Why did you go to Carlos' hideout?
HELEN: He wanted me to go with him on a mission, to pose as him wife.
HARRY: And you agreed?
HELEN: Yes.
HARRY: Why?
HELEN: I don't know. I guess I needed something...
HARRY: What did you need?
HELEN: I needed to feel alive. I wanted to do something... outrageous. And... I don't know... it felt good to be needed. To be trusted. To be special.
