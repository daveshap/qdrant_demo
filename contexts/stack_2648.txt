Snapping two line shapefiles according to attribute field value using ArcGIS Desktop? I have a two line shapefiles (Trace.shp and Snap.shp). There is a GIS_ID field in both files.  Now I want to snap \"Snap.shp\" to \"Trace.shp\" according to GIS_ID value. I have tried to use Snap tool for ArcGIS Desktop but I am not sure about the results because using that solution I am not sure that line is snapped to the right line from another layer with the same GIS_ID. I want to do that using ArcGIS 10.4
