Viewshed Analysis for Custom DEM file I am new to qgis and trying to do 2 things. My objective is to have an accurate viewshed analysis at the end. But my DEM file is of poor resolution. I do have a shapefile with building height details. I am trying to (Part1) find a way to make a new DEM with building heights and (Part 2) calculate the viewshed from certain buildings from the created DEM. (Part3)At a later stage, want to be able to tell from which buildings is a certain polygon on the ground visible. Does anyone know how to do this?
