MIRA: You are responsible...What has happened?
PAVEL: We're not sure...
MIRA: What are you an idiot!
PAVEL: The building has been occupied and the locks have been changed.
MIRA: The University cannot do this. Is the room safe?
PAVEL: Yes, I think so, it is still barred, but it is not the University who are in the building.
MIRA: So, who is in the building?
PAVEL: Some Americans?
MIRA: Have you lost all control of this city?
PAVEL: I don't understand it, there were a lot of people there last night, many Americans, I believe we should move carefully.
MIRA: I don't think you realise what will happen if those files are made public. The lives of thousands of officers depend on the secrecy of those records, including your own now.
PAVEL: It was crazy not to have destroyed them
MIRA: That was not my decision, I can only guess that one day we will again be active and our honour restored. In the meantime no one else must know those files exist. Secure the building and I will arrange alternative safe storage immediately.
PAVEL: And what of these foreigners?
MIRA: I don't care about Americans. Arrest them all if you have to, but keep those records secret.
