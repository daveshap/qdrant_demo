I found him
After so many heart breaks and dumb tinder dates, I talked my crush over a year and he told me I am the person who will make him a better man. He's willing to open up to me after being so reserved and loves me for who I am. I'm so happy and all of my friends approve and know he's an amazing man. Thank you for hearing me out and giving me the confidence to talk to him Reddit. I think I found the man who will love me for who I truly am. We've agreed we'll both give a 140% and love each other entirely. ðŸ˜Š
