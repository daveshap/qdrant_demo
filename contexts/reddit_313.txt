Should I prioritise my own issues or my sister's?
I have an exam in 5 days that will basically determine the university I'm going to go to and it's stressing me out so much.

My sister has her final assignment due also in 5 days for her online university course and she is pressuring me to help her with it because she isn't that good with English. Knowing how her previous assignments took days when I helped her with it, I refused (yet I feel like a **** for doing so, irrationally???).

I tried telling her to do it herself because it literally is your course, therefore your responsibility, but she's not budging. I know that inevitably, I am going to somehow help her in these 5 days but I just want to know what other people would do, or say if they were in my situation.. thanks.
