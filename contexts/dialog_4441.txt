SMECKER: And it's the same story over here. Why the crossover? Theories.
DOLLY: That's just fucking weird. I have no idea.
DUFFY: Jesus. I just can't think anymore. That scene over at the coffee shop today tapped me out.
SMECKER: What?
DUFFY: A guy went nuts over off of Commonwealth today. Shot three guys to death in a coffee shop in broad daylight. Fled the scene. Don't have much on him.
SMECKER: Why was I not informed of this?
GREENLY: They weren't related. The guy used a 38. No pennies. Totally amateur.
SMECKER: Who were the victims?
GREENLY: A couple of peons for the mob and...
SMECKER: Oh that's just BEAUTIFUL! All the scumbags in the quiet city of Boston start dropping dead and you think it's unrelated?! Greenly, the day I want the Boston Police doing my thinking for me, I will have a fucking tag on my toe! Now, get me a squad car and get me over there. I want the crime scene photos and any witness statements. NOW!
