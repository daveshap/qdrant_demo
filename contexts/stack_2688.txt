Merging several .hgt files into one I'm currently struggling on trying to combine several .hgt files with different software. I can get the 4 tiles into any kind of software but my issue is exporting the file back to .hgt file. I've tried using VTBuilder, which allowed me to easily blend the 4 tiles together. I made sure the projection was indeed to WGS 84 and the column and rows were at 1201 as a SRTM should be (as I have got 4 together perhaps I should have double them to 2402x2402?).I then exported the data as .bt file from VTBuilder and imported it into Landserf, having seen information that it could write .hgt, which doesn't seem to be the case. I supposedly found a workaround by saving the file as a .bil and changing the file name manually to .hgt... It doesn't work as it should.To give you all the context, I am working with grasshopper using the plugin elk. The grasshopper component cannot read 4x .hgt files and is asking for only one file larger than the area I am looking at ( which is 24.6420 to 25.1627; 94.8683 to 95.2968) hence why I am trying to combine them all together. I have access to QGIS and the software mentioned before.I cannot seem to find anybody that has raised this issue before on the forum or online for that matter.
