This sub has become a cesspool of forever alone rhetoric
Way too many posts and comments in this sub are trending into forever alone territory by people who are dying for others to join their pity party and give them affirmation that dating (especially online dating) is pointless if you are an “average man”.

These people show up in practically every post and instantly try to shift the discussion toward them and how bad things are for men. Doesn’t matter if the post was written by a woman about a woman’s perspective on dating, these foreveralone types will always just marginalize their concerns and say “but what about men??” or “but men have it harder”.

* Dating is difficult for EVERYONE of both genders.

* Women don’t have it easy simply because there are a bunch of guys who want to have sex with them. In fact, those very guys are the reason WHY it’s difficult, because if you want a serious relationship you have to figure out who is serious and who is just pretending to be sincere to get in your pants

* Stanford University reported in a 2017 survey that online dating is the MOST POPULAR way for heterosexual couples to meet (39%). So the rhetoric that “average men” have no chance in online dating is a delusion that guys use justify their bitterness. 

Dating is not easy and has never been easy. If you take some time to listen to, understand, and emphasize with the perspective of other people (especially women) instead of just drowning them out with “what about men”, you will quickly realize that.
