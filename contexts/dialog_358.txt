MRS CHRISTIAN: Have a pleasant evening. Will you have tea, Mister Welles?
WELLES: Thank you.
WELLES: He's odd.
MRS CHRISTIAN: He's a lawyer. Please, sit, here...
MRS CHRISTIAN: I've spoken to friends of mine and my husband's, in Harrisburg, in Lancaster and Hershey. Asking about you. I must say you have friends in influential places.
WELLES: I've been privileged to provide services for people I admire.
MRS CHRISTIAN: You are highly recommended. Praised for your discretion... your strict adherence to confidentiality.
MRS CHRISTIAN: As you know, my husband passed away recently. Two weeks ago now.
WELLES: My condolences.
MRS CHRISTIAN: His passing has left me with... something of a dilemma. A terrible, terrible dilemma.
WELLES: I'll do whatever I can to help.
