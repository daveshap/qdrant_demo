I took a shower today!
I haven’t showered in almost a month beforehand but I finally showered today. With super hot water and was in there for like an hour it felt so nice. I always told my mom about my anxiety and we’re gonna go to a clinic today to check on my body. I’m very scared, very nervous, VERY anxious, but it’s for the best and I know I can’t keep pushing this. Hope it all goes well!!! <3
