My mom just found A2C and it's so cute how excited she is
I would think that she would be very frantic and controlling (typical Indian mom lol) but she is so excited and surprised at all the amazing resources of this sub! She keeps sending me links to all these different essay guides and wholesome posts and whatnot. She's so motivated seeing how helpful and driven y'all are. 

She isn't as nervous for me about the college process.  She's learning so much about how brand-names aren't important and how the process should be about your passions and what make you happy. I'm so proud of her and so grateful for y'all! Best part is when she asks me if I've seen a recent meme lol. Thank you a2c for being the bestest sub ever that you managed to teach my hardened mother about college!
