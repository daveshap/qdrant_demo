HARRY: Is that right, that's what you do for a living?
CHILI: What I did till recently. After I get done here I'll think about what I'm gonna do next.
KAREN: With your experience, you could always become an agent. Right, Harry?
HARRY: Yeah, that's what we need. More agents.
KAREN: Well. I got an audition tomorrow.
HARRY: No problem. You go on off to bed.
KAREN: What I'm saying, Harry, is I want you and your new buddy to get out of my house.
HARRY: Oh, yeah, sure.
