DORSETT: Don't I know it. Come on in Agent Rodgers. Sit down. Always a... pleasure to see you. How can I be of help?
RODGERS: It's a bit more like how can we help you. Bay Area's become quite a hornet's nest in terms of subversive activities. And... well Mr. Hoover wants to reiterate that the FBI will be happy to assist local authorities in any way we can. On a strictly advisory basis... of course.
DORSETT: Of course. Well, I appreciate your offer, but we got things pretty well under control. Same bunch of kooks you guys already have under surveillance. They're still doing a lot of yelling and pot-smoking but nothing to worry about.
RODGERS: I see. What about the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense?
DORSETT: Heh, bunch of shines running around in dark caps waving their fists about some streetlight. They're loud, but they aren't dangerous,
RODGERS: Can you make a deal with them?
DORSETT: Naw... They're kids mostly. Idealists. They actually think they're for real.
RODGERS: Hmmm. As you know the Bureau -- and Mr. Hoover -- is particularly sensitive" to anything that might agitate or solidify the coloreds on the left."
DORSETT: You want me to put a man on it?
RODGERS: That would be an excellent start. Tell him to keep a low profile.
