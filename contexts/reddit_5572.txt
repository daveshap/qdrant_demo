What Does "IT Operations & Help Desk" Mean?
I tried looking it up on google but couldn't find a concise definition or any explanation of when it's OK to put this on your resume.

I volunteered but worked a lot in a position called "IT Coordinator" with a non-profit political organization. As part of that I entered data, beta-tested, and gave technical support.

I definitely did "IT Operations." "Technical support" sounds like "help desk" but I don't know if these are equivalent or not since "help desk" may have a specific meaning I am unfamiliar with.

Currently on my Indeed profile I just put myself down as "Volunteer/Member" for the job title for this organization and listed my various (changing) roles that I played in it. When I applied for a certain position it said I should have the job category "IT Operations & Help Desk". Would it be OK if I separated the different roles in this position into separate items and label the "IT Coordinator" position as "IT Operations & Help Desk", maybe with a description saying the formal title was "IT Coordinator"? Or is there something about the definition of "IT Operations & Help Desk" that I am unaware of which would disqualify me from claiming to have held such a position? In which case is there anything I can do applying through Indeed so that even though I don't have that particular experience listed I can get them to notice that I have similar experience?
