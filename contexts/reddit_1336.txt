It's going to be okay. Just breathe.
I have a pattern where for a few weeks I'm fine, Perfect even. And then it goes back into worrying, Stress, And feeling down. I'm on the second one right now unfortunately. But I know I'll be okay. And while I'm down I wanted to hopefully send good energy to anyone else that may need it right now. I don't know you, And I probably never will, But you aren't alone I promise. It will get better, It has to. You're amazing and strong for fighting this. You will prevail.
