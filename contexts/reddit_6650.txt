Applying to the same job from multiple hiring agencies?
So somebody from a hiring agency contacted me about a job through Linkedin, which i sent them my resume for.  In trying to research more about the position, I found another hiring agency posting for the same job.  Would it be unethical (?) for me to also apply with the other hiring agency...as I understand they would both be competing for the same recruitment fee.
