MRS. LOWOOD: That makes it all the more difficult ——
MARY: Difficult? Has anything happened to Jacqueline?
MRS. LOWOOD: We don't know, Mary. We've been unable to get in touch with your sister.
MARY: Sometimes she can be quite careless. Why don't you try Mrs. Redi?
MRS. LOWOOD: I have written repeatedly to Mrs. Redi. She vouchsafes no information whatsoever. It is six months since your tuition has been paid, Mary. Naturally, it is impossible for you to stay on here as a paying pupil.
MARY: Of course.
