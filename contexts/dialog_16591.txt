GEORGE: I said we're getting out of here. Back to civilization. I made a deal with the porters. They brought in a load of books or something, and they're leaving tomorrow at dawn. They're waiting for us five miles outside the valley. Come on, get your things together. Where's your top coat?
CONWAY: You can't leave, George.
GEORGE: Why not? What's going to stop me?
CONWAY: You mustn't. You've got to stay here now.
GEORGE: Stay here?! What's the matter with you, Bob? You've been acting strangely ever since we came here. I've never seen you like this. Why can't we leave? What's stopping us?
CONWAY: Something grand and beautiful, George. Something I've been searching for all my life. The answer to the confusion and bewilderment of a lifetime. I've found it, George, and I can't leave it. You mustn't either.
GEORGE: I don't know what you're talking about. You're carrying around a secret that seems to be eating you up. If you'll only tell me about it.
CONWAY: I will, George. I want to tell you. I'll burst with it if I don't. It's weird and fantastical and sometimes unbelievable, but so beautiful! Well, as you know, we were kidnapped and brought here . . .
