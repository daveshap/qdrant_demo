Is the European Union's "General Data Protection Regulation" implementable in the United States?
Both Facebook and Google are the first companies to face complaints on the grounds of [forced consent](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-7-gdpr/) in Europe.  As other companies operating in Europe face formal challenges to otherwise legal data processing ([buying and selling personal data to third parties](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/06/online-data-brokers/529281/), [tracking users after they delete their accounts](http://bgr.com/2018/03/21/facebook-privacy-settings-limit-tracking-delete-account/), etc) in the United States, much to the dismay of [privacy advocates](https://www.courthousenews.com/ca-privacy-advocates-face-off-against-tech-companies/), could a similar law be promulgated in the United States without running afoul of the Constitution or other common law developments? What are the practical effects of this law among EU member states and is it enforceable there?
