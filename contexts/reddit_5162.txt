Needing some input or suggestions concerning job hunt or resume
Hey everyone. Looking for some insight. I've been out of work for well over a year now (left on rough terms for good reason though). Nonetheless, everything I've applied to I'm turned down. Fast food? "I'm overqualified" ; anything in the restaurant business? "Not enough experience" ; anything office or customer service related? "You must speak spanish" ; the last job that was lined up, the person called my old boss who made it so I wouldn't be hired. I'm at a loss. Can anyone give me some ideas? Thanks in advance.
