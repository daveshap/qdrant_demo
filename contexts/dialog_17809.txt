JOE: What for?
RATSO: So you could sleep! I mean Christ!
RATSO: I drug in a cot, if you want to stay.
JOE: Well now, Ratso, I'm gonna tell you something for your own good, only first gimme a cigarette.
JOE: You want me to stay here tonight, is that the idea?
RATSO: I ain't forcing you, like, I mean, who's forcing you?
JOE: Oh. Guess I got the wrong impression.
RATSO: I want you to stay, okay? I goddam invited you, didn't I?
JOE: Well, I hope you know what you're in for. I'm a very dangerous person. Someone does me bad like you. If I caught up with you that night, there'd be one dead Ratso long about now. Hear?
RATSO: I'm impressed. You're a killer.
JOE: So if you want me to hang around for a few days, I thought you should know.
