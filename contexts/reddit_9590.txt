Moving from Teaching to Student Affairs/ Academic Advising???
Hi everyone! New to this sub & I really liked the advice y'all were giving, so I thought I would seek some of my own! 

I currently teach high school history and have since I graduated undergrad in 2017. Right now I'm 5 classes away from being finished with a masters in middle grades education, which I began when I thought I still wanted to teach. After doing some soul searching (and continuously being yelled at by teenagers) I decided that the classroom is not where I want to spend all my time. I'd really like to move into an academic advising position or something similar. I want to stay in education, but not as a teacher.

How easy/ possible do you think this would be? A lot of the skills that are posted on job listings match what I do as a teacher, except I do them with students before they hit university age. I've applied to a few places but either haven't heard back or have been rejected. Any helpful hints? Thank you!!
