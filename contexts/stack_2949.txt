Difference between conserved quantities and constants of motion? In Hamiltonian mechanics, consider extended phase space, the trajectory followed by a particle in that space is formed by an intersection of different 2n dimensional surfaces, all of these surfaces are constants of motion, are any symmetric transformations associated with these constants of motion?what is the difference between constants of motion and conserved quantities formed from symmetric properties?
