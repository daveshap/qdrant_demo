SOLVED: How can you set high priority on \"games\" permanently? I had question to ask, and is if there is a way to set steam games (more specifically the games themselves, that shows up as launchers or releases; example: payday2_release) in high priority permanently, or at least to set it on high priority every time i launch the game without having to manually open the system monitor.
