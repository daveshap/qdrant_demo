Got stood up ... not even mad
(22F)Talking to this guy(24) on tinder for a while, he was eager to meet . I was not cause have some issues.
We decided to meet today , but he didn’t show up . I waited for 3 hours called him but he wouldn’t respond. Was not even pissed cause I have this thought process , if it didn’t happen probably it was for my best .
Now chilling with my pizza and watching a movie .


Update: He texted me after 27 hours saying “ sry I got a heart attack , was at the hospital” “ ....hmmm ok .......and the pizza toppings were - sausage,jalepenos and corn
