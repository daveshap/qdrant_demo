DOROTHY: ...just that the Witch is so wicked. I don't think you two ought to come with me because you'll get into trouble.
SCARECROW: Oh, you don't think we're going to stand by and let her get away with fireballs and bees, do you?
TIN MAN: No, sir!
SCARECROW: No, sir!
DOROTHY: Oh, you're the best friends anybody ever had! And it's funny, but I feel as if I've known you all the time. But I couldn't have, could I?
SCARECROW: I don't see how. You weren't around when I was stuffed and sewn together, were you?
TIN MAN: And I was standing over there rusting for the longest time.
DOROTHY: Still, I wish I could remember. But, I guess it doesn't matter anyway. We know each other now, don't we?
SCARECROW: That's right.
TIN MAN: We do.
SCARECROW: To Oz?
TIN MAN: To Oz!
