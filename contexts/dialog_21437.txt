VIVIAN: Kit...
KIT: Everybody keeps starin' at me.
VIVIAN: Yeah... I know what you mean.
KIT: What do you know? You look <u>good</u>. All dressed up. You clean up real nice. You sure don't fit in down on the Boulevard, lookin' like you do. Not that you ever did anyway.
VIVIAN: You think I fit here where they just about chew your food for you?
KIT: Where do you fit?
VIVIAN: I kissed him, Kit. On the mouth.
KIT: Honey, you're not supposed to do that.
VIVIAN: I know. I stopped pretending and started liking it with him for real.
KIT: Oh, my god, you mean it was good?
VIVIAN: It was great.
KIT: Dummy.
VIVIAN: He wants to set me up in a place, give me some money.
KIT: I pray for that.
VIVIAN: All I'm doing is feeling lousy about it. I don't know what to do. What do I do, Kit?
KIT: Go for the bucks.
VIVIAN: I don't care about bucks. I might love this guy.
KIT: Wow, are you in deep shit. You know he'll break your heart.
