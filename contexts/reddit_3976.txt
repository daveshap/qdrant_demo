(Kinda Gross) I'm pretty sure I love this guy
For context, I just got my new car this December.

My boyfriend and I decided to try out this new restaurant in town. It was a nice little lunch, we talked and whatnot, normal sort of stuff. When we were getting ready to leave, and he asked me to drive home since he felt nauseous. I went ahead and drove him back to his house. So, we're almost there, and then it happens... He vomits in my car, and looks up at me and starts crying. Honestly, I couldn't help but laugh. He looks at me with this sort of bewildered look in his eye, surprised I'm not screaming at him or throwing a fit for making such a mess. I finally break my chuckling with, "I can't believe you beat Fergus (his boxer that's notorious for throwing up) to it!" I get out of my seat to help him sit down (this all happened behind a coffee shop by his house) and went to go get him water and some paper towels. The baristas were really good sports, offering me a whole roll of towels and a couple of cups of water. He helped me clean it up without question, and I sat with him on the curbside to make sure he was ok, even calling him after he got home to make sure he was alright. I don't think I'd do that for anyone else, and I really do hope this relationship goes on for even longer.
