Am I going to get laughed out of the room if I ask for $10k over the stated salary for an entry-level position if I have a lot of really valuable experience?
The vitals:

-B.S. in environmental science
-5 years in digital/technical marketing
-Pursuing an environmental technical writing position for a big firm at the entry level because I want to get out of marketing and into more sciencey stuff 
-Located in Hawaii where the cost of living is high.  

 I have a firm that wants to hire me.  Though they consider it entry level, the job sounds high stress and skilled.  The interviewer agreed.  It is with a great company with tons of room for growth.  They are looking for someone in the 40k range.  

Entry level tech writers with 0 experience apparently have a median salary in the 52k range in this region.  Also, it's a hard truth that anything below $55k is extremely difficult to live on in this area.

I really want to get my foot in the door with this company, but I dont want to lose the opportunity by asking for too much money.

I am the typical self deprecating millenial who has always been underpaid because I chose underpaid work over no work in the beginning.  Now that the economy is better I am sick of being poor and feel that I may actually have some negotiating room.  But where do I begin?  I have never in my life negotiated a salary (22 year old me didnt know I could do that).  Any advice is deeply appreciated.

Edit:  I should clarify that I graduated in 2012 and have been working doing digital marketing for engineering firms, but not environmental firms.  I've been doing petroleum and electrical.
