ROB: We can show her the schoolyard.
ALVY: Right. I was a great athlete. Tell her, Max, I was the best, I was all schoolyard.
ROB: Yes, I remember. He was all schoolyard. They threw him a football once, he tried to dribble it.
ALVY: Yeah, well, I used to lose my glasses a lot.
ALVY: Oh, look, look, there's that... that's that's my old house. That's where we used to live.
ANNIE: Holy cow!
