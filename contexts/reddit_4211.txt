(asking women) -- Do you like it when a guy is going in for a kiss and lifts your chin with his hand?
To be clear this is with the assumption that you are with a guy you like, not just some random guy at the bar or at the end of a horrible date  you just want to end.   

I heard from somewhere that women don't actually like this, I heard it a long time ago and I can't remember where but it stuck.   But more recently I have seen comments from women saying they really liked this when they are with a guy they like.   

I realize that no one can speak for all girls, and that more often than not communication and asking is probably better in general.  I'm looking for as much of a  general consensus as I can get.
