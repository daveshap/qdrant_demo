I Want to be a Wildlife Biologist Someday, But I'm still Indesicive because of my lack of Knowledge In this Track. Help Me Please...
 

Hi, I'm an incoming Grade 10 Student. We might take our NCAE Test in the upcoming months. I was still indecisive about the career that I want to pursue. I know there are still years left before college, but I was very curious about the path that I want to take. I have lots of questions.

\*What are the jobs that are embodied in studying Animal Biology, Wildlife Studies, and Environment Studies?

\*How can I ensure that I can get a stable job when I graduate? Should I get a master's degree after I graduate? or I should serve for government jobs to repay for my scholarship (like DOST).

\*What course should I take if I want to pursue to be a Wildlife Biologist or Animal Rehabilitator? Should I take BS Bio or BS Forestry? or should I take other courses?

\*What school really does focuses on these aspects? Should I take a famous and well-known school?

\*How many years can it take to have a stable career? What is the estimated income of these jobs?

\*They said that if I study this track, I might end up being a teacher because my ideal career is not having a major impact on our country. Am I really going to be a teacher?

\*Lastly, should I take other courses first and find a temporary job to earn money to study these courses?

I'm really sorry for asking clown questions, It might seem laughable but I only have a little information about this track that I want. Please notice my message and help me clarify these things. Thank you so much for your valuable time!
