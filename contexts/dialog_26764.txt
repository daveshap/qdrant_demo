JOHN: Jesus... you were gonna kill that guy!
TERMINATOR: Of course. I'm a terminator.
JOHN: Listen to me, very carefully, okay? You're not a terminator any more. Alright? You got that? You can't just go around killing people!
TERMINATOR: Why?
JOHN: Whattaya mean, why? 'Cause you can't!
TERMINATOR: Why?
JOHN: You just can't, okay? Trust me on this.
