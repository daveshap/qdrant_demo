MAX: I know if I had to pick, it'd be Choke
WELLES: Devil" frightened me as much as it excited me
DINO VELVET: You said something about money.
WELLES: Yes. What we're looking for is rather specific.
WELLES: That's five thousand dollars.
DINO VELVET: Is it?
WELLES: Five thousand now, five thousand on delivery. Two women, one white and one black, as long as they have large breasts. Hard bondage, or course. Other than that, trusting your artistic interpretation, I have only two stipulations.
DINO VELVET: And they are?
WELLES: I want to watch you work.
DINO VELVET: I'll consider it.
WELLES: And the other performer... it has to be that monster you use... the man in the mask.
DINO VELVET: Machine.
WELLES: If it's not him, there's no deal.
DINO VELVET: He might be interested... but it would mean another five thousand.
WELLES: We can do that.
DINO VELVET: Well, well, I'll have to put my thinking-cap on about all this. You'll leave the money as a deposit? Very good.
DINO VELVET: You have a beautiful face... the way the light hits it. I'd like to take your picture. You don't mind?
WELLES: I'd rather you didn't.
DINO VELVET: What's the problem?
WELLES: I'm camera shy.
DINO VELVET: You trust me to keep your money, but not to take your picture?
WELLES: Those are two different kinds of trust. Thank you for your time. I hope we can do business.
