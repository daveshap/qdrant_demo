JACK: What do you want me to do about it?
WENDY: Ah, come on hon. Don't be so grouchy.
JACK: I'm not being grouchy. I just want to finish my work.
WENDY: Okay. I understand. I'll come back later on with a couple of sandwiches for you and... maybe you'll let me read something then.
JACK: Wendy, let me explain something to you. Whenever you come in here and interrupt me, you're breaking my concentration.
