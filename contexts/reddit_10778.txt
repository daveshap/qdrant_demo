I have sexual thoughts about kids. I'm 26. Please don't hate me, I already hate myself more than you ever will.
I wasn't always this way.  But sometime around 2011, I began to notice that I felt certain urges and thoughts when near prepubescent children.  They aren't urges to hurt them or, god forbid, do *that* to them...but I would sometimes imagine them naked and using the toilet.

That sounds really strange, and this requires some backstory on me: since my teens, I've been aroused by images of people going to the bathroom (don't ask why, who the hell knows).  It mostly pertained to people my age...but then I accidentally came across a kid (Google Image, I don't go to any...*sites*, good lord) and found myself equally aroused.  I was horrified.

I know this is really, really gross and sick, I know.  It's happening more and more often, these thoughts.  I had a therapist who knew, but when she moved away, I had no one.  Trust me, it takes months or even *years* to build up that kind of trust for me.  I can't even say the...word...itself because I am so sickened by how I think sometimes.

Believe me: you cannot hate me more than I hate myself.  I nearly attempted suicide twice in college and it was a big part of my rationale for truly attempting suicide in March.  Please, please, just...be kind.  That's all I want.  I've never felt more alone.
