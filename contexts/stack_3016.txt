Difference between Airy disk and seeing disk In the diffraction pattern for a circular aperture, instead of just having a circle, we have a central disk and several faint rings around the circle. Does the Airy disk consist of only the central disk or does it also cover the surrounding rings? It's that I've seen written on several sites that it was just the central disk, but in others it says it covers the rings and now I'm confused. And what is the difference between the Airy disk and the seeing disk?
