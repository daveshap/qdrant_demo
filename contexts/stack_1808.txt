A word for \"a forceful part that temporarily becomes part of a whole without losing its unique identity\" I am struggling to find the word that best resembles the above situation.I have been looking through some synonyms and antonyms but cannot quite get the right word.Context<br>I am talking about a human individual who temporarily becomes part of a team or organization and through his/her being, injects a powerful change to that whole without actually being assimilated by the whole and thus keeping his/her unique identity through which contribution to the resulting state remains distinguishable.Origin<br>The question results from a conceptual exploration into the distinguishable added value of an ideation consultant/advisor, strengths-based teaming and the word impetus. First ideas<br>I was looking at words like: fuse, merge, mix, blend but these are all related to chemicals and take the notion that the individual properties of the elements involved either dissolve or become highly diluted and thus hard to distinguish.
