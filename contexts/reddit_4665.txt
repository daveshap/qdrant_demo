Messed up college and now stuck in life. No idea how to get out of this hell.
This has been very stressful. I tried two years of college but it was just way too heavy for me mentally. I thought I could handle it but I was absolutely wrong. I've lost lots of credits and not even sure whether I can try again in the future. I'm even too scared to call for information. My parents don't know about this. Not even my friends. Everyone keeps asking how I'm doing in uni but I don't wanna be judged so I keep it to myself and say that everything's perfectly fine. I'm planning to work this summer but no idea what I'm going to do the next year(s). I don't want to be living paycheck to paycheck and struggling just because my depression messed up my future. I don't know what to do and this has been killing me for the past few months.  


Edit: Thanks everyone for the wonderful replies. I'm sorry it took me a week to check the replies but somehow I was a bit scared. There's a lot that I have to work on but you guys gave me some great advice I'll take to hear. Thank you so much!
