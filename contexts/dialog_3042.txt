BARBARA: How long has it been, Uncle Alfred?
ALFRED: Ten years. Barbara isn't really me niece, sir. She's Joanna Clark's daughter.
BRUCE: Of course. Alfred still keeps your mother's picture in his room.
DICK: Anybody want to tell us kids in the cheap seats who Joanna Clark is?
ALFRED: Joanna and I were in love in London. But when I realized our age difference was too extreme -
BARBARA: Uncle Alfred left for America. Much to my mother's dismay -
ALFRED: Eventually she married a young physician.
DICK: Al's main squeeze. Is she here? I'm about to scrape the bottom of my shoe off my tongue, right?
BARBARA: My parents were killed in an auto accident ten years ago. Alfred has been supporting me ever since.
BRUCE: You have?
ALFRED: Secrets are a virtual prerequisite in this house, don't you think?
BARBARA: I'm on break from-
BRUCE: Oxbridge Academy?
BARBARA: Their new computer sciences division. How did you know?
BRUCE: I recognized the accent.
