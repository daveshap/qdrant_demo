UPDATE: Boss wants me to hide that I quit
My boss called me (she has been in contact with me at least everyday since I quit, which is new since we'd go weeks without contact whilst working for her) and told me that I am not allowed to mention my job on social media. She said that someone flagged up a post to her in which I said I was unhappy with my job and that things hadn't been going well and I was stressed, which she said was both embarrassing to the company and to myself (even though the company or specifics were never mentioned). She has said she is doing me a favor by asking me to remove this as a future employer would look down on this. 

I will be speaking to her supervisor tomorrow, but she keeps saying my contract came to a "natural end," which is strange to me because I quit. She has emphasized that I don't say anything bad about her or the job once it is done, however, once my notice period is up, I am confused over what she can even do....and at this point since I'm within my notice period, I am still confused as to what she can do to me for vaguely mentioning my unhappiness on social media. 

Can't wait to be rid of this job.
