DR. GREENBAUM: But you said you have the worst reputation.
SEBASTIAN: I do.
DR. GREENBAUM: Don't you want to change that?
SEBASTIAN: Let me tell you something, doctor. Chicks love a guy with a bad rap. They say they don't, but they don't mean it. They all think that they're the ones that are going to save me." The trick is to let them think it's true."
DR. GREENBAUM: I think that's all the time we have for today.
SEBASTIAN: Same time next week?
DR. GREENBAUM: No. This is going to be our last session.
SEBASTIAN: Why? I like spending time with you. You know, you're quite attractive for a woman your age. You have killer legs. Killer.
DR. GREENBAUM: This isn't a joke. Your parents spend a lot of money to send you here. I'm trying to help you.
SEBASTIAN: Don't be insecure, Doc. You're a big help.
DR. GREENBAUM: You think you can come in here with that cute little smirk on your face and try and flirt with me. It doesn't work, Sebastian.
SEBASTIAN: It works a little.
DR. GREENBAUM: No it doesn't. I see right through you.
SEBASTIAN: You do?
DR. GREENBAUM: I hope for your sake you grow out of this immature phase. It's going to get you into trouble.
SEBASTIAN: Well, you don't have to get nasty about it.
DR. GREENBAUM: My daughter, Rachel.
SEBASTIAN: Yummy.
DR. GREENBAUM: Don't even think about it. Rachel is an exceptionally well rounded young woman, who happens to be attending Princeton this fall. She's way too smart to fall for your line of b.s.
SEBASTIAN: Really? Care to make a wager on that?
DR. GREENBAUM: Good luck, Sebastian.
SEBASTIAN: What, nervous I'm going to win?
DR. GREENBAUM: Would you please leave.
RACHEL: Hi, mom.
DR. GREENBAUM: Honey, is something wrong?
RACHEL: He told me he loved me and I believed him.
DR. GREENBAUM: Who told you?
RACHEL: You don't know him. I'm so stupid.
DR. GREENBAUM: Alright honey, just calm down, take a deep breath, and step out of the circle.
RACHEL: Would you cut the psycho babble bullshit, mom. There's pictures of me on the internet.
