“If you feel suicidal, call the suicide hotline or 911”
I can’t deal with constantly hearing and seeing this. Once, a long time ago, I called the suicide hotline and then they sent a ton of police to my house. Now I can’t drive for fear of getting pulled over by the police and getting triggered. I hate hearing it all the time, it’s just a lie. They aren’t going to help me, they’re going to send police to my house who will take me to a hospital and lock me in and then send me a bill that I can’t afford. I wish I could actually talk to the suicide hotline people without a legitimate fear of being locked up in inpatient.
