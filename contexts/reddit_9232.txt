I feel like everyone I told is incredibly unimpressed with me
But I'm very happy I actually have a four digit number in my savings now!!! 

I'm healthier as a result too, I only buy from the farmers market for my groceries and stay away from junk food! I only go into the city once a week for said farmers market, I walk to campus everyday and avoid using PTV and enjoy the stroll past the park and see cute dogs and enjoy nature 

Instead of loitering outside, I spend more time experimenting in the kitchen (I made a loaf of bread!!!), I read and write more, I've become more introspective and my cats bask in my more constant presence :) 

I know my username says NEET but I am working lol I just feel like a NEET since most times I feel a bit aimless haha but time is precious and I'm happy to be this productive and peaceful and also finally letting my wallet breathe!
