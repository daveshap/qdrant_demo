Replacing an old 2 speed rotary cam switch with VFD I bought an old drill press tnw super condor 30l but the motor smoked because of the rotary cam switch is broken.The drill is old and the motor have no motor plate but few engraved numbers 380 and 20 the others can't be read, I can't find the rotary cam switch. The company that made them cannot be found \"brevetti ergo italia\it was 500v/5.5hp (that's what i remembered i lost the paper that describe the rotary cam switch technical details, i remember and a number I12.07)  rated rotary cam switch. So i was thinking if it is possible to replace the rotary cam switch with a VFD. I read on one post that say's using VFD will make the motor give half of its torque, i can live with that as long it worksEdit: The motor is 2 speed motor
