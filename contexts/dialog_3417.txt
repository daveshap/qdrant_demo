LESTER: Anybody else?
WOMAN #1: Do we get to wear a crown?
LESTER: But of course.
WOMAN #1: Count me in.
LESTER: Good. I think its time to beckon Mr. Flemmer. Perhaps He can help us out of this pickle.
FLEMMER: Boy, this is a toughie. To be honest, I didn't anticipate this.
LESTER: And as I said, sir, we can't very well exert physical persuasion upon the sacred vessel Malkovich.
FLEMMER: Right, Lester. I heard you the first time. I'm not a dummy.
LESTER: Didn't mean to imply that you were, sir.
FLEMMER: Look, I'm going back to my house to ponder this. So stay calm and keep track of Schwartz's comings and goings. Oh, and somebody dispose of Schwartz's wife, will you? Nice to meet you all.
