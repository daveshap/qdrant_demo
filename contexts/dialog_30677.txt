SYLVIA: Is it possible to go in right after the explosion?
CLAYTON: Yes, with these suits. We've used them before on atomic tests... Odd- looking, aren't they?
SYLVIA: Very futuristic. Yours doesn't really go with that butch haircut!
CLAYTON: I could wear it longer -- but it's less trouble this way.
SYLVIA: My kid brother has one. You know why?
CLAYTON: Yes ... Fits better in a football helmet.
SYLVIA: How'd you guess?
CLAYTON: That's the kind of a kid brother you'd have!
