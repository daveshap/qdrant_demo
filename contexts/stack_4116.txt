Applying for a Georgia tourism visa I am applying for Georgia and UK visas. I know the UK will ask me to drop my passport for 15 days, but I don't know if Georgia will ask me to leave my passport with them. I have my visa interview on the 29th, but there is an open date for Georgia. Does Georgia ask the applicant to leave the passport with the application? I'm applying from Malaysia, not my home country.
