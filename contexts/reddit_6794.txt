Is Rocs Grad Staffing Legit?
 Hi all, I'm currently in NOVA, I just got a call from Rocs Grad Staffing, saying they help recent grads find jobs, I had a 5-10 min phone call with them, I looked on glassdoor later and found about 1/2 of the reviews call it a scam where they bait and switch the applicant. Any advice?
