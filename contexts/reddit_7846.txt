How does having research mentors at other institutions work?
Hi everyone,

I am headed to the UW School of Medicine next year with a really strong interest in medical anthropology. The problem is, UW does not have a particularly strong medical or biological anthropology program. They do have very strong public health programs, but the closest they really get to touching anthropology/ethnography is 'biobehavioral science' and that's sort of a ways away. 

So, I'm hoping that I could find research mentorship from other institutions. There are some researchers at UCSF in particular who are doing work that I'm really interested in. 

How does it work to have research mentors at other institutions? Can you even do that? Does it just look like a ton of emailing and Skyping?

Thanks for your help!!
