Do high speed particles see light as a different part of the EM spectrum due to the Doppler effect? If a particle was travelling fast enough and had visible light shot at it, would the partice experience the light as if it was higher or lower wavelength? If so, would the particle see the incident light as having different energy? This doesn't seem right, as its the same light whether the particle is moving or not, so it should have the same energy.
