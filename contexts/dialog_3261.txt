LYDIA: Is this the key to the attic?
JANE: That's a skeleton key. It'll open any door in that house. Will you give it to your father? And you might mention that I single-handedly decorated the house. In case he needs advice in that area. Come see me.
JANE: Are we going to be seeing you at Miss Shannon's Boarding School?
LYDIA: Yes, but I'm going to live at home.
JANE: Remind me to talk to your mother about the dress code. I'm sure you're going to be very happy there.
