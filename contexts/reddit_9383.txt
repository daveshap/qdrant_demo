One step forward...
So I just got a $1 per hour raise at work, which will almost cover the increase in my health insurance premium.

Two family members gave me cash for Christmas, which I had to use to pay for a new car battery. Sigh, I had plans for that money. 

I got 4 lottery tickets in a Christmas card and won $14, that I cashed at the drug store customer service window. Then walked 6 feet away to the pharmacy window and handed over my big winnings for new prescriptions.

But at least good things happened in the first place! Wishing windfalls, however small, to everyone here in 2019.
