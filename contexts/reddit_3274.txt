i keep earring find you passion, but i just don't have any...

I am at a point where i think I jsut never will find any work I am passionante about, where i can be happy to go to when waking up in the morning.

SO, I am kinda trying to jsut work the least possible as a compensation to be happy, is it okay to only want to find a stress-free work with the best condition possible ?! (no matter the field)

If i could work like 30h/week in an office doing whatever they teach me, I would be super happy, even more if commute isn't long and 30min lunch instead of 1h lunch, and felxible time, and vacation and unlimited unpaid vacation !!

Bascailly is it okay to job hunt for conditions instead of a passion or career development ?!

Anyone else in the same boat as me ?!

And anyone knows how to search for syndicate job only around in my area ?!
