I was hoping my blood results came back abnormal...
At least I'd have an explanation as to why I feel depressed and have been for 6 years. 


But the results came back normal. No thyroid issues. No diabetes. No anemia. I'm perfectly healthy even with the poor cognitive skills, feeling tired, and shaky when I don't eat every 3 hrs.


It's unfortunate I can't trade my stellar health with someone suffering from a terminal illness. I don't have suicidal thoughts, but I do find it irritating I ever existed anyway.
