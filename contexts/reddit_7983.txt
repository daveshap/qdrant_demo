Rent/Stipend ratio?
Hi all,

I'm moving to Atlanta this Fall to start my PhD journey, but so far all of the financial stuffs for the next five years are driving me mad lol. My stipend is relatively good (36k/year, so 2k5/month post-tax), but Atlanta is getting much more expensive than I remember it to be. I wonder if spending 1k3-1k5 for rent (excluding other bills) out of a 2k5 pay would be too much? My SO is looking for a job in Atlanta as well so we won't have to worry about this if that works out, but she's an international student, so the options are limited.
