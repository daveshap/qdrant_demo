Did I just screw myself with my response about salary requirements?
Hey all,

So I just had an interview with a large company and it went great. I was referred to the position by a friend, and I knew going in that the starting salary for this position was $42k (I'm currently making $32k). During the interview, the recruiter asked what I'm currently making now and what my expectations are, so I was honest and told her I'm making $32k currently but I don't think I'm being compensated enough given what I do at my current job, and I'm looking for "at least $40k." I didn't want to give her a huge number above my current salary because I didn't want to seem unrealistic. Do you think $40k is the max they'll pay me now? Or since it's a corporate company, they'd offer the starting salary of $42k?
