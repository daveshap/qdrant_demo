Non-traditional Student Services
Hi all! I posted the other day and had some great responses. Today I'd like to bring some attention and increase my knowledge of any non-traditional student services you may have seen at your institution or had a hand in implementing. Have you seen an increase in services? How does your institution handle this growing, at-risk population? 

I'm conducting research as well as trying to change the culture at my school to allow for a broader mix of students to have access to Higher Ed. If comfortable please share the name of your institution so I can browse in to services and bring that to the table at my home university.
