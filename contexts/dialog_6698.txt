RAYMOND: Mr. Zammito?
VINNY: Uh huh.
RAYMOND: I represent a person who wishes to remain anonymous, but is aware of your current financial problems with your brother.
VINNY: I don't know what you're talking about.
RAYMOND: I understand. The person who sent me wishes to help you.
VINNY: How?
RAYMOND: You see that car?
VINNY: Yeah.
RAYMOND: It's yours. A gift. A gift you could give to your brother... or anyone you owe money to as partial payment.
VINNY: No shit?
RAYMOND: The papers for the car will arrive tomorrow.
