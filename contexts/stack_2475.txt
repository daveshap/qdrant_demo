ogr2ogr apply sqlite dialect to multiple feature classes within a fgdb I have a quite many feature classes in a filegdb and they all have same data schema (same field names and etc).I wanted to apply a single sqlite query and I am having hard time to make a loop command<blockquote>  ogr2ogr -f \"filegdb\" -a_srs epsg:3857 -dialect sqlite -sql \"select scalecoords(geometry,0.0000000002), field1, field2, field3 from \"FEATURE_CLASSES_WITHIN_A_FILEGDB\" \"inputGDB_Dir\"  \"outputGDB_Dir\"</blockquote>what I did was simply applying <blockquote>  For /R %g in (inputGDB_Dir) do ogr2ogr -f \"filegdb\" -a_srs epsg:3857 -dialect sqlite -sql \"select scalecoords(geometry,0.0000000002), field1, field2, field3\" \"inputGDB_Dir %g\"  \"outputGDB_Dir\"</blockquote>and obviously, it does not work.I would like to know how to make a loop command using OGR2OGR
