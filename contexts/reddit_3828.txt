I think one of the most nerve wrecking part about a first date is not the date or the person but being in a pubic setting.
For me, I feel like the hardest thing is being in a public area. Like a coffee shop or a restaurant. You guys meet up or maybe you guys go there together and everyone knows near you that it’s a date and they might even know it’s a FIRST date depending on how you guys act around each other and all the eyes are on you. I hate drawing attention.
