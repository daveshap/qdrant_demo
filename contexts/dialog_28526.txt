GUILD: D.W.R." That case you worked on... the guy who threatened to kill Wynant... what what was his name?"
NICK: Rosebreen.
GUILD: Could this be him?

NICK: Yes. But we figured it was just blackmail...
GUILD: Just the same, Wynant wouldn't mind having him out of the way, would he? How long should you say this body'd been here, Doc?
