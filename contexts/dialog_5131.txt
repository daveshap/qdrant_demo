KAYLEIGH: God, Evan! I never thought I'd see you again. How've you been?
EVAN: Oh, comme si, comme ca, you know...
KAYLEIGH: No, Evan. I don't know. It's been a long time. Fill me in.
EVAN: I'm going to State now. Things are going okay. I guess. Mom's good...
EVAN: Not since we were kids.
KAYLEIGH: I've stopped a hundred times.
EVAN: So how's Tommy?
KAYLEIGH: They kept him in juvy for a few years. Now he works over at Dale's Autobody.
