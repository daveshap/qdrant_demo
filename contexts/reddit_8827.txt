What are the arguments for and against a state having a Governor's Mansion?
Currently, there are [three](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_governors%27_residences_in_the_United_States) U.S. states that do not have an official governor's residence (Arizona, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island). The other 47 (and Puerto Rico) have an official residence for the governor, with maintenance of the property often [paid](https://www.ocregister.com/2015/10/17/gov-jerry-brown-to-move-into-long-vacant-governors-mansion-after-16-million-remodel/) [for](https://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2014/oct/31/charlie-crist/crist-says-scott-spent-800k-governors-mansion-reno/0/) [by](http://www.repchristiana.com/NewsItemPrint.aspx?NewsID=9110) the state (although the extent that the state pays for the governor's living expenses vary by state).

Why is it that this is a near universally implemented practice in the United States? What are the arguments for and against having a governor's mansion, and for maintaining it with public money?
