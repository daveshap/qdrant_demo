Do Certifications Help with Getting a Job?
I really wanted to go to college but never got a chance because I couldn't afford to. I recently visited Harvard's school website and they're offering free course but with around $49 you can get a certificate in so subject on this website "edX". I was curious if anyone has pursued these certificates or have gotten a job in result of one. Just so I can be sure these are worth paying for?
