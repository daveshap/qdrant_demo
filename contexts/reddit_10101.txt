Volunteerism in student run clubs
I'm a graduate, but I still help out the biology club at my alma mater. So whenever I have a free moment I like to look up current events and interesting bio articles and pass them along to the current president. This helps her out because then she doesn't have to come up with the week's discussion topic and if the club is holding any type of event I like to look up some easy science projects to help keep interest in this academic clup rolling.
So here's the thing, the current president asked my opinion of how to advertise for a trash pick-up they are having in the near future. The club likes to do at least two trash pick-ups a semester (trash pick-ups usually consist of going along road sides and picking up trash.) and the first one of the semester is coming up real soon. But, nobody likes to spend a couple hours out of their day to get dirty and help keep America beautiful. Does anyone have any advise on how to advertise for a trash pick-up (or similar event) in a way that even non-members may respond positively to? Even a new way to advertise might help. We traditionally use paper posters around the science building on campus and a few more on the advertising boards found around campus. There isn't a huge budget for advertising, but any advise would help a ton! Thanks!
