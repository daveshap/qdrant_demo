JEANNE: Stop, stop... I can't remember! The battles were all so confusing... there was so much smoke, dust, noise... I was being attacked on all sides, so... maybe... perhaps I fought back but it was only to defend myself...
MAN: So your memory's coming back?
JEANNE: Yes... yes! And now you tell me why God let all these battles happen in the first place... if he's so powerful... he said he's the creator of heaven and earth
MAN: Is he the one who spread all this blood and misery?
JEANNE: No, but... why didn't he stop it? Or did he get pleasure, watching us killing each other in his name?
MAN: In His name??
JEANNE: Yes! We fought and killed in His name... the King of Heaven!
MAN: Really?
