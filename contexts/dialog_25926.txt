JACKIE: I have an appointment this after- noon. I need someone to take them to the park.
RACHEL: What? And have Federal agents jump out of the bushes with court orders? How many years do you get in this state for giving second-rate care to minors?
JACKIE: However many. It's not enough.
RACHEL: I'm already on thin ice. Yesterday, I actually thought my boss was going to fire me.
JACKIE: Fine, forget it.
JACKIE: Bandaids for cuts. Bandaids for new shoe blisters. Packet of Wash n Dri's. Kleenex. Sugar free lollipops, potty seat covers for public restrooms...
RACHEL: Why not just bring the whole toilet?
JACKIE: Ben likes to be read to. Do you know Dr. Seuss...?
RACHEL: Not personally.
JACKIE: Do you have a word limit you need to hit every day or can I finish?
