MARY ROBERT: Mary Clarence -- you're alive!
MARY PATRICK: Christy.
MARY LAZARUS: Van Cartier.
CHRISTY: You know? About me? About everything?
CHRISTY: Reverend Mother -- Thank-you.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Oh?
CHRISTY: You saved my life.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: I'm a Christian.
EDDIE: Don't you have a concert to go to?
CHRISTY: That depends. Sisters, you don't know this, but Reverend Mother's been making all sorts of noises about resigning. That's bad news. I don't know if we could sing, if we thought that was true.
MARY ROBERT: Not a note.
MARY PATRICK: Impossible.
CHRISTY: Then I guess you're stuck. Life sentence. No parole.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Very well. I hold you responsible for all of this, For introducing a lounge act into my convent. For utterly disrupting our way of life. And for placing all of us in mortal danger. Thank-you.
CHRISTY: Yeah, Eddie, thanks a whole bunch. Thanks for sticking me in a convent. So you think, after all this, maybe I really am a nun?
EDDIE: I don't know. There's only one way to be absolutely sure.
CHRISTY: Yeah, like what?
VINCE: I was good to you! You re nothing but no-talent garbage! You're a two-bit Tramp!
CHRISTY: That used to be true, Vince. I was with you. But something happened. And I'm different now. Real--different. I've had, well, you might call it -- a religious experience. And I've got just two words for you. And those two words are...
MARY ROBERT: Mary Clarence!
CHRISTY: Bless you.
