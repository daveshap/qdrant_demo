A tip for the lurkers and commenters here: Go to /personalfinance if you want to be a judgmental prick about money and people’s problems instead of in a POVERTY sub.
Like what is wrong with some of these people?? The vast majority of people who use this sub is specifically because they are POOR/STRUGGLING. We post here for advice, tips, and support. We don’t post here so we can get X amount of comments from judgmental assholes who say over and over, “Just get a job” “sounds like you’re the problem” “get over it” “this is your fault” “work harder” “How is this possible for you to be poor??” ”Just move, I don’t see the issue.”


Let me tell you something, because I think I speak for most of us. I work beyond full time. I work side jobs in my free time, including on my lunch breaks everyday. My circumstances are *none* of your business, but my circumstances are still valid. Everyone’s are, especially if they’re making an effort to escape them. I was born into a very lower class family, my parents were from poor families. Most of us born into this are already off on the wrong foot. Poverty is a vicious cycle most of us are all fighting like hell to break and get out of. It takes time. It takes effort, which again, the vast majority of us are giving that full effort. We are **trying**, we really are, but living in/coming out of poverty is fucking *hard.* Not to mention that our society does not make escaping poverty easy. It costs money to move. It costs money to learn a trade, go to school, go to the doctor, get mental health help. While of course, it’s not impossible (we know this), so many people act like escaping poverty is a quick fix. This is untrue.

To add to that, there are different tiers to poverty. Some people are born into it, others fall on incredibly hard times, some people get fucked over by their families or loved ones (eg: taking loans out in our names, ruining credit, stealing our money, etc etc), some people are disabled, some people just make mistakes, learn from them, and are trying to pick up the pieces. And the sad fact is ~~some~~ many people, despite working hard which so many of you claim we don’t do, are only one or two paychecks away from poverty, just barely staying afloat, and doing all they can. It. Happens. Maybe not to you - and congratulations to you all - but it happens to people every single day. We are living it. It’s literally all around you.

We are still human. I’ll repeat that: **we are still human.**

Some days, we just really need to vent. That’s all. It doesn’t mean we aren’t trying. But working hard, trying to be strong, dealing with the stress, it all gets to you. That’s part of the whole “being human” thing. It’s a heavy weight to carry. That’s what, in my opinion, this sub is for. Being able to relate and hear others out, and offer advice, it’s what helps people continue to push through when they feel like giving up, and makes the weight a liiiiiittle less heavy. 

You don’t get to call someone lazy, make general shitty judgments and overall rude assuming comments about how they got where they are nor why they’re where they are now, when the *only* thing you know about their lives is exactly what is posted here. 

So if you’re the type of person to judge and criticize those on this sub who seek out advice or just want to vent, maybe step away from the screens and take a good hard look at yourself. Reflect on your poor character and be better. Having some perspective will make life a little less miserable for you, and maybe you’ll gain a little empathy. We may be struggling, but at least we treat others with respect. Because for a lot of us, who we are and our determination to live better lives despite any circumstances and the holier-than-thou ignorant bullshit around us is almost all we have. The last thing we need is to be kicked while we’re down. 

We won’t stand for it. I know I won’t. Not anymore.

Edit: and to those who have dealt with this and/or are just struggling right now, I hear you. I see you. You are more than your circumstance, and you’ll get through this. Keep fighting the good fight and vent when you need to. Better days are coming!

And of course you will always have people who victimize, or just won’t help themselves or don’t take accountability (it still doesn’t justify insulting and degrading them, but I know there are people who need to recognize certain issues when they’re in their own way). But just speaking generally, being in a bad financial position doesn’t mean you aren’t trying. Everyone is different, what works for some doesn’t work for others. Just...be freaking nice to people? Offer constructive advice? Or just don’t say anything at all if it’s nothing good or necessary.
