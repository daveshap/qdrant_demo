GALE: For God's sake, tell him I'm on my way. Let's go, Chucky. A police escort is gonna pick us up en route. You too, LaPlante.

GALE: If you're not in the car in ten seconds, I'll have the cops pick you up.
BERNIE: The cops! What kinda bullshit is this? Is this America or -- ?
GALE: Here! Here... ten, thirty, fifty bucks. How much have you got, Chucky? Give Mister LaPlante your money.
