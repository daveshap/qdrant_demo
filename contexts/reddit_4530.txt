Message for those who need it
I just want everybody to know that you are worth fighting for! You are enough (in whatever your struggle is). You are so amazing and strong for keeping the fight up for this long! I believe in you!! I’m proud of you for fighting this long!! Know that you have someone that loves you, cares for you, and is on your side when you think the whole universe is against you. My inbox is open to whomever needs it (I might just need some time to get a reply out). Don’t let anyone dull your sparkle!!

I lost a close friend that lost her battle with her mental illness a year ago and I want to do what I can to help others cause I know she’d do the same if the situation were reversed.
