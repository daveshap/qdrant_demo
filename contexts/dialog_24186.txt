HIGH CONSTABLE: There is a farming community upstate, Constable... ten days journey north in the Hudson Highlands. It is named Sleepy Hollow. Within a fortnight, three persons have been murdered there. Each with their head lopped cleanly off. The elders of the Hollow have sent dispatches to me, requesting assistance, and now, just this very moment, I have chosen you.
ICHABOD: Chosen me?
HIGH CONSTABLE: These methods" of yours... there has been no practical application."
ICHABOD: Not for lack of trying.
HIGH CONSTABLE: Just so. Granted. And so you take your experimentations to Sleepy Hollow and catch the murderer who has tainted the place. Bring him here to face our good justice. Will you do this for me?
ICHABOD: I shall, gladly.
HIGH CONSTABLE: Excellent. Then, you are excused till morning.
