KOPALSKI: They tell me when you ring once the valet comes in; when you ring twice you get the waiter; and do you know what happens when you ring three times? A maid comes in -- a French maid.
IRANOFF: Comrades, if we ring nine times... let's go in.
BULJANOFF: Just a minute -- just a minute -- I have nothing against the idea but I still say let's go back to the Hotel Terminus. Moscow made our reservations there, we are on an official mission, and we have no right to change the orders of our superior.
IRANOFF: Where is your courage, Comrade Buljanoff?
KOPALSKI: Are you the Buljanoff who fought on the barricades? And now you are afraid to take a room with a bath?
BULJANOFF: I don't want to go to Siberia.
IRANOFF: I don't want to go to the Hotel Terminus.
KOPALSKI: If Lenin were alive he would say, Buljanoff
IRANOFF: He wouldn't say that. What he would say is Buljanoff
