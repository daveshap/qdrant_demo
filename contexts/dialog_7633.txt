DR. MONNITOFF: Each vessel travels along a vector path through space-time... along its centre of gravity.
DONNIE: Like a spear.
DR. MONNITOFF: Beg pardon?
DONNIE: Like a spear that comes out of your stomach?
DR. MONNITOFF: Uhh... sure. And in order for the vessel to travel through time it must find the portal, in this case the wormhole, or some unforeseen portal that lies undiscovered.
DONNIE: Could these wormholes appear in nature?
DR. MONNITOFF: That... is highly unlikely. You're talking about an act of God.
DONNIE: If God controls time... then all time is pre-decided. Then every living thing travels along a set path.
DR. MONNITOFF: I'm not following you.
DONNIE: If you could see your path or channel growing out of your stomach, you could see into the future. And that's a form of time travel, right?
DR. MONNITOFF: You are contradicting yourself, Donnie. If we could see our destines manifest themselves visually... then we would be given the choice to betray our chosen destinies. The very fact that this choice exists... would mean that all pre-formed destiny would end.
DONNIE: Not if you chose to stay within God's channel...
DR. MONNITOFF: Donnie, I'm afraid I can't continue this conversation. I could lose my job.
