PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN: You see, I never rebuilt the time machine after it was destroyed in 1952. I decided that experimenting with time and possibly changing history was too risky. Anyway, experiments in time travel were banned in all 87 states after the governor of Cuba caught Dr. Felstien fooling around in the Bermuda Triangle -- that was back in '64.
MARTY: 87 states? Time travel bans? What the hell?
MARTY: But if you didn't rebuild the time machine, how did I go back in time in the first place?
PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN: According to your girlfriend, Suzy Parker, you and she were at the movies. You went to the restroom and you never came out. Obviously, you stepped through an inter-dimensional time warp, created by the original operation of the time machine.
MARTY: Obviously!
PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN: But I told everyone your disappearance was due to a teleportation experiment you were helping me with. So don't mention anything about time travel to anyone.
MARTY: What theater was I at?
PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN: The Orpheum.
