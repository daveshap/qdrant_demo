SHERMIN: You sure you want this, because... that's putting an awful lot of faith in people we have no control over...
FOX: I'm afraid the situation demands that kind of risk.
SHERMIN: I don't like it, George...
FOX: Dammit Shermin. Earlier you were asking for help. What's changed?
SHERMIN: It's messy... the thing's got a gun... We're just asking for somebody to get killed...
FOX: We don't know what else to do. We need results.
SHERMIN: You'll get results one way or the other, that's for sure... Okay.
FOX: I'm gonna be here if you need anything.
MAJOR BELL: They're gonna let some local cop blow him away.
LYMAN: Save us all a lot of trouble.
MAJOR BELL: Jesus Lyman, you're an ignorant fool.
LYMAN: Bullshit!
MAJOR BELL: You have no conception of this, do you?
LYMAN: You jerk! You look at all the sweetness and light and goodness you think'll come out of this. You know what's gonna come out of this... The end of religion, the end of civilization, the end of the earth. We could become slaves, we could become a colony of these things. Don't you see that? Are you too stupid to see that?
