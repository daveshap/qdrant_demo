How do I find the default gedit color scheme xml files? I know how to find new color schemes and alter them slightly to fit my liking. And I can make them slightly similar to the defaults.What I want to do, however, is change one of the defaults slightly. To do that, I need the xml files of that scheme or some documentation on how to write a gedit color scheme.Can someone point me to either the default scheme xmls or the documentation about them?
