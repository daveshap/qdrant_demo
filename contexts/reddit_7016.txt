Can you put a price on job security?
  

I am a mid-level manager for a very large BPO, work from home on the west coast, and have an overall team of 19 individuals located in other countries that I manage remotely. I’m a college dropout that started entry level, and worked my way up through the company starting in 2010. 4 years ago, my current employer acquired my previous one, and I survived the acquisition with a pay increase and increased responsibilities. Well, now my current employer has been acquired by another company, and my hopes of surviving this acquisition are very low for a variety of reasons.

This has been a roller coaster of employment for the entire 8 years I’ve worked for this company, and the go-to motto is “Embrace Change” but that usually means layoffs, restructuring, and other negative things. I love my job, the work that I do, and the people that I manage, but I’ve rarely gone more than 2 months at a time without a sinking feeling or sense of dread that I’d be next on the list of RIFs. All in all, every single person that I counted as a friend has been laid off over the last 3 years, and I am all that's left.

Because this is my only real career that I’ve ever had, I have no idea if this horrendous lack of job security is normal for everyone, normal for the industry I’ve gotten sucked into, or only normal for the company that I have the pleasure of working for.

I’m about to hit the job market again, and would like to get some insight into how much people value job security, or if it’s take-what-you-can-get. I’d love to start, you know, planning to buy a house, but I cannot fathom taking that risk not knowing what’s around the corner.
