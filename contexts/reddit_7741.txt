It's super early into my grad school experience and I don't feel well
For a project in one of my classes, I had to submit a hypothesis and experimental method to test it. My professor's feedback was simply "Let's touch on this more before class next week." Makes me feel like it's really bad, which makes me paranoid that I'm going to be the dumb one in the class

Having problems in my research lab, and I'm going to have to leave, which means I'm going to be delayed in doing real research and put me in a tough financial spot. 

I'm feeling overwhelmed already and it's less than 2 months in my first year in my master's degree. I feel like things shouldn't be this hard this early.
