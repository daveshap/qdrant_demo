Getting Accounting Gigs
My wife has finally gotten her work permit after a pretty lengthy visa process after getting married and moving to the country about a year ago. Since December when she got her visa she has been applying to different entry level business roles in Accounting, Analyst, or even basic book keeping. She hasn’t even gotten any opportunities to interview over the phone yet. 

She started branching out to more basic office admin jobs as she would like to work soon and begin to save some money but no real luck yet. I tell her that it’s a numbers game and to keep applying but she thinks the problem may be that her degree in Accounting is from Vietnam.
I was wondering if anybody here in a hiring role or who works with any immigrants that got on with work visas have any tips for her to get hired. I don’t need the money from her working even if the income would be nice so we can take our time and be selective with roles. 

As far as her English is concerned she has enough fluency to hold conversations with people with some difficulty when it comes to nuanced language or metaphors she isn’t used to. But if people talk slow and are direct she gets it and her reading comprehension is really good so I don’t think it’s only a language issue even though that could be at play. But again she hasn’t even gotten to the phone interview part so that would be a preconceived prejudice against her.
