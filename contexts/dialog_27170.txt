CUTHBERT: I got it after I was mugged in the subway last spring.
JONATHAN: Where's the walk-in safe?
CUTHBERT: Behind you.
JONATHAN: What's the combination?
CUTHBERT: I'll do it. Just let me find my portable phone.
JONATHAN: Forget it!
CUTHBERT: Calm down. I found it!
CUTHBERT: Battery's dead. Shit.
JONATHAN: Let's go!
CUTHBERT: That thing won't come after us, right? It's going for bigger game. The group blundering around in the basement. Poor fools.
JONATHAN: Hurry up!
CUTHBERT: Just a minute. I'm shaking! Take the gun.
