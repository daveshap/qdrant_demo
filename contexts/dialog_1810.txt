DOBISCH: Oh, Buddy-boy. I was just about to call you. I'm sorry about that mess on the living room wall. You see, my little friend, she kept insisting Picasso was a bum -- so she started to do that mural -- but I'm sure it will wash off -- just eyebrow pencil.
BUD: It's not Picasso I'm calling about. It's the key -- to my apartment -- you were supposed to leave it under the mat.
DOBISCH: I did, didn't I? I distinctly remember bending over and putting it there --
BUD: Oh, I found a key there, all right -- only it's the wrong key.
DOBISCH: It is? Well, how about that? No wonder I couldn't get into the executive washroom this morning.
BUD: And I couldn't get into my apartment -- so at four a. m. I had to wake up the landlady and give her a whole song and dance about going out to mail a letter and the door slamming shut.
DOBISCH: That's a shame. I'll send the key right down. And about your promotion -- -- I'm sending that efficiency report right up to Mr. Sheldrake, in Personnel. I wouldn't be surprised if you heard from him before the day is over.
BUD: Thank you, Mr. Dobisch.
