Is the Trump administrations proposed cutting of security aid to Pakistan justified?
[According to the New York Times, the Trump administration has decided to cut a considerable amount of the security aid given to Pakistan, likely based on President Trump's position that Pakistan gives "safe haven to agents of chaos, violence and terror."](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/04/us/politics/trump-pakistan-aid.html)

[It is almost universally accepted that the Taliban exist in some form, within the boundaries of Pakistan.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehrik-i-Taliban_Pakistan) However, is their presence due to Pakistan governments inability or reluctance to eradicate them? In other words, does Trump's motive hold merit?
