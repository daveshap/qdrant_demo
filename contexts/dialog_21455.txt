VIZZINI: Faster!
FEZZIK: I thought I was going faster.
VIZZINI: You were supposed to be this colossus. You were this great, legendary thing. And yet he gains.
FEZZIK: Well, I'm carrying three people. And he's got only himself.
VIZZINI: -- I do not accept excuses. I'm just going to have to find myself a new giant, that's all.
FEZZIK: Don't say that, Vizzini. Please.
