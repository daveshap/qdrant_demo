DULANEY: You wouldn't like what you'd see. You don't know me anymore. I don't know me anymore.
SHARON: We can't pretend this isn't happening.
DULANEY: Please -- not now.
SHARON: Why didn't you come to me?
DULANEY: I don't know.
SHARON: You used to like to touch me -- to make love to me.
DULANEY: It's more involved than that.
SHARON: It was a place to start.
DULANEY: You think that's the answer? Sex? Is that what you want? You want me to make love to you?
SHARON: I don't want our lives ruined because of this. I love you, Frank. I want this to work -- but you have to help me. You have to come back from where ever it is you are.
SHARON: Frank -- stop it! Stop it!
DULANEY: Is this what you want -- huh? Is it?
SHARON: Let me go! Godammit, Frank let go!
MICHAEL: Daddy -- stop it!
