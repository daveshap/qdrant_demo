GRACE: Thank you, John.
JOHN: You're welcome, Grace.
GRACE: You're not from around here, are you?
JOHN: Why you say that? Just because I help a lady with her package?
GRACE: You don't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day.
JOHN: I just drove in this morning.
GRACE: Drove into Sierra? What for?
JOHN: Didn't have a choice. My car overheated up the road.
GRACE: Good luck it didn't happen a few miles back. Maybe they never would have found you. Day like today you'd be dead for sure.
JOHN: Yeah, my luck. I get to be stuck out here in this hole in the desert.
GRACE: Least you can leave.
JOHN: Not until my car's fixed. I don't know how long that's going to take.
GRACE: And here I've made you all hot and sweaty.
