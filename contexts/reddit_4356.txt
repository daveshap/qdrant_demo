I got a cat, and I feel so much better
So, recently I have been dealing with anxiety and depression, I have been feeling so lonely and worthless.
One day I woke up and went to cook some breakfast a cat came through my backyard door and started meowing and I decided to give some food to her, this routine repeated from time to time and suddenly I started buying food for her, and one night she brought little kitties, they were three, two black and whites and one little gray one.
I sexed them and found that they were two boys and one girl.
I started feeding them and found them a home eventually except for the gray one.
She started to be in heat and I decided to take her to my house, I gave her all her vaccines and medicine.
She has warm up and when she hears me cry she comes and meows while asking me to cuddle her. She has become a really important part of my life, even when I don't want to take care of myself I have to take care of her, play with her, pet her and go to the vet with her.
She has provide me with routine and love, I absolutely adore her, she is always up for cuddles and helps me to relax.
