SENA: It's as though there were two people in that room... both of them asleep... both of them dreaming.
RUBY: That doesn't make sense.
SENA: Add it to the list.
RUBY: So what do we do?
SENA: I don't suppose I can go back to the University and chase young coeds again... pretend this whole thing never happened...
RUBY: Not yet.
SENA: Then I'd say we should put Jason under again... run another tape on him and see what happens. We'll get extra data this time. Video... infrared... the works.
RUBY: Great.	When can you do it?
SENA: Tomorrow. If you can clear it with the Sheriff's department.
RUBY: I'll have to lean on them pretty hard after what happened last night... but I think I can do it. Let me know what happens.
SENA: You're not going to be there?
RUBY: I was there once... that was enough. Besides... I have to go out to Jason's house tomorrow. They're... digging up some new evidence.
