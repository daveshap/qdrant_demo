JANET: Maybe we could try it this way.
BRAD: Janet! Oh! Yes it's alright. Janet. Everything's going to be alright.
JANET: I hope so my darling.
BRAD: You!
FRANK: I'm afraid so, Brad. But wasn't it nice?
BRAD: Why you - what have you done with Janet?
FRANK: Nothing. Why do you think I should?
BRAD: You tricked me. I wouldn't have - I've never - never.
FRANK: I know, but it wasn't all bad was it? I think you found it quite pleasurable. Oh so soft. So sensual.
BRAD: Ahhh - no - stop - I mean Janet. Janet.
FRANK: Shush. Janet's probably asleep by now. Do you want her to see you like this?
BRAD: Like this. Like how? It's your fault - you're to blame. I thought it was the real thing.
FRANK: Oh come on, Brad, admit it. It was enjoyable, wasn't it? There's no crime in giving yourself over to pleasure.
BRAD: You promise you won't tell?
FRANK: On my mother's grave.
