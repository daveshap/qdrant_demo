LYDIA: <u>You</u> did this? You carved all these little figures and houses and things?
ADAM: I certainly did. I'd finish it too, but... I don't get out much.
LYDIA: And this used to be your house, I bet. Why do you want to scare everybody?
ADAM: We want to frighten you away. So that you'll move out.
LYDIA: You don't know the Deetzes very well, do you? My father bought this place. He never walks away from equity. Why don't <u>you</u> leave?
BARBARA: We can't. We haven't left the house since the funeral.
LYDIA: Funeral. God, you guys <u>really are</u> <u>dead</u>! What was it like? The funeral. Did you cry?
ADAM: We weren't there. The handbook says funerals aren't for the dead.
LYDIA: God, if this is true this is like, amazing! I kinda like it up here. Can I visit you sometimes?
BARBARA: Well, I don't know... We don't get many visitors.
ADAM: Where are your skulls and bones?
BARBARA: You know you're really a pretty girl.
LYDIA: I don't wear that stuff to <u>bed</u>. Besides, there's <u>nothing</u> wrong with it. I'm getting out of here.
BARBARA: Wait... I don't think it would be a very good idea if you told your parents that we're up here.
