Considering international law, what can the Trump Administration expect Honduras, Guatamala, and Mexico to do about "stopping people from leaving their country and coming illegally to the U.S." ?
"Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador were not able to do the job of stopping people from leaving their country and coming illegally to the U.S." [Trump twitter](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1054356145798856704?s=21)

US law defines a refugee as a "person who is unable or unwilling to return to his or her home country because of a well-founded fear of persecution due to race, membership in a particular social group, political opinion, religion, or national origin." [USCIS](https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/refugees-asylum/refugees)This would exclude the Hondurans  fleeing because of starvation, poverty, and gangs, correct? 

What happens if the person isn't granted refugee status? Are they then exempt from Articles 32 and 33 of the [Refugee Convention](https://cms.emergency.unhcr.org/documents/11982/55726/Convention+relating+to+the+Status+of+Refugees+%28signed+28+July+1951%2C+entered+into+force+22+April+1954%29+189+UNTS+150+and+Protocol+relating+to+the+Status+of+Refugees+%28signed+31+January+1967%2C+entered+into+force+4+October+1967%29+606+UNTS+267/0bf3248a-cfa8-4a60-864d-65cdfece1d47) stating they cannot be expelled or sent back to their country of origin?

What is the US's stance on asylum seekers compared to Canada, Australia, and Europran countries? What about compared to Central America, South America and their participation in the [Cartagena Declaration](http://www.unhcr.org/en-us/about-us/background/45dc19084/cartagena-declaration-refugees-adopted-colloquium-international-protection.html)?
