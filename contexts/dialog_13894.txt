LESTAT: Yes, that's you, my handsome friend. And you'll look that way till the stars fall from heaven.
LOUIS: It can't be...
LESTAT: Give it time. You're like a man who loses a limb and still imagines he feels pain. It will pass. And we must sleep now. I can feel the sun approaching.
LESTAT: You must get into it. It's the only safe place for you when the light comes.
LOUIS: And if I don't?
LESTAT: The sun will destroy the blood I've given you. Every tissue, every vein. The fire in this lantern could do that too.
