ALFRED: Yes?
KNOX: Alexander Knox. Gotham Globe.
ALFRED: Mr. Wayne is out for the day.
KNOX: Actually, I wanted to talk to Batman. Pass that on to Mr. Wayne, would you?
KNOX: That's how it is, chum. One column - and I can bring all this tumbling down. I can take you off the streets for good.
BRUCE: What is it you want?
KNOX: I want you to hang up the suit. And I want you to stay away from Vicki.
BRUCE: I can't do that. Not while the Joker's still at large.
KNOX: Then stay away from Vicki. That's all I want, man. I just want your word.
KNOX: See, I don't know how it happened... she's a smart girl and you are an extraordinary screwed-up guy... but she's in love with you.
BRUCE: Tell me, Knox. If you've got the story, why haven't you printed it?
KNOX: Because I... ... Because she'd never speak to me again.
