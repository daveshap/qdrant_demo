JEFFREY: Next Christmas. Is he Santa Claus who has left a present for Dorothy? What was it? An ear? Another ear?!! What was it?
DOROTHY: Do you know?
JEFFREY: No.
DOROTHY: You don't?
JEFFREY: No. What is happening?
DOROTHY: Maybe you don't know. I know you though. You're Jeffrey Beaumont and I know where you live and I know ways to get you and I know ways to kill you.
JEFFREY: Please don't talk like that. You're upset. I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for what I did. I better go.
DOROTHY: Go then. I can't let you put it in me now but I want you. I like you.
JEFFREY: Then don't talk about killing.
DOROTHY: Did I say that? I didn't mean it, or did I? Sometimes I think it would be fun. Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little secret. I want to die.
JEFFREY: Don't say that.
DOROTHY: It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep now.
JEFFREY: OK.
