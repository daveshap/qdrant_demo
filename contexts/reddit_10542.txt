I’m 15 and honestly just have no will to live anymore
It’s like... one good thing happens and then a million shitty things happen and I can’t seem to get one moment where I am ever truly happy. Then I’m constantly anxious and paranoid, plus I’ve been hallucinating. 
What’s the point? The only reason I’ve stayed here past 12 years old is because of my sister and now she’s a little brat who hates me because all I do is stay in bed. My parents don’t say it but I know they are disappointed and wish I was a better child. 
All I have is my girlfriend who I can’t even say is my gf because her fucking ex might swoop her off her feet again before I get the chance to even kiss her for the first time. 
I can’t open up to anyone close to me because to me it’s not opening up it’s just dumping all my problems on them. 
I just wish I didn’t fucking exist, that people didn’t care about me and that I could die, or start self-harming in peace again. I mean I did relapse but I can’t even relapse on my wrist so I doesn’t hurt as bad I have to cut on my thighs. 
I just want it to be over. All of it. My depression, my anxiety, my fucking undiagnosed shit, my family problems, I wish that my ex had never molested me. I just want it to be over and I can’t talk to anyone but internet strangers about it. I’m pathetic.
