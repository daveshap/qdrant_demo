MR. STANWYK: Good evening.
FLETCH: I like your outfit. You got the fifty grand and the plane ticket?
MR. STANWYK: Of course.
MR. STANWYK: Why don't you check it out for yourself, Mr. Nugent?
FLETCH: Because I trust you, Alan. By the way, the name's Fletcher. I.M. Fletcher. I write a newspaper column under the name Jane Doe.
MR. STANWYK: What?
FLETCH: Read this, please.
MR. STANWYK: Wait a second --
FLETCH: Cut the crap and read it.
