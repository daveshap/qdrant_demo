Valentines day, the perfect day for me to kill myself
I've been stuck in this vicious cycle of anxiety-depression-loneliness for over 4 years now. For the past 2 years I've had pretty much daily suicidal thought, I wrote my suicide note in november and now finally decided what day I'm gonna hang myself.

I'm 21 and ashamed of myself and hate myself in every way. I have zero confidence, I haven't achieved anything in my life, dropped out of college, anxiety makes me stress/freak out about thing other people do like it's nothing. Even regular conversations make me stressed because of how insecure I am. Got a horrible relationship with my parents. I don't enjoy anything anymore, every aspect of the future frightens me. Losing touch with my only few friends. Been starved of physical affection all my life beside of being abused by an older cousin when I was about 9. I've never even kissed a girl and now it's too late for me. I'm hopeless cause I'm too inexperiencedfor someone at my age and not good enough for anyone. I'm skinny af and fucking worthless no one has ever loved me or ever will.

Love only gives me negative feelings. It makes me anxious, panicky, makes me realize I'm not good enough. All the stuff I haven't done or experienced before makes me freak out  just by thinking about it so why even bother trying anymore. For the past months, despite trying to surpress it, i've been falling in love with the only female colleague I have a pretty good connection with but she's rediculously far out of my league, quit a lot older and will leave soon so it's another heartbreak either way. Better end it before yet another all time low. I have empathy and am glad for other people being happy and in a relationship but even just hearing a love song makes me instantly suicidal. So hopefully 14/02 will be the last day of my useless insignificant existance.

Thanks for your interest I've you've been reading untill this point.
