FELL: Of course, Commendatore...
PAZZI: Could you tell me: did you ever meet your predecessor, Dottore Fanelli...?
FELL: I never met him. I knew him only from his writings.

FELL: ...yes.
PAZZI: You have taken over his offices, is that not so?
FELL: It is only temporary, until my confirmation by...
PAZZI: Of course, <u>in</u> his offices, if you come across anything, any personal papers of his, anything, however trivial, would you contact me, please... Are his personal effects still at the Palazzo?
FELL: Yes. Packed and with an inventory.
PAZZI: I'll have them picked up.
