My SO has no friends.
My SO moved to my city to get married about 2 years ago. They're an incredibly charming, social, smart, cool person. But they've been very stubborn about making an effort to make their own friends and it's starting to affect me. 

Every couple has their spats and needs to talk shit to someone else, and the only friend they have is MY best friend. To be fair, she's awesome and is a great friend to both of us, but she's told me directly that she is primarily my friend first (from before I even met SO). I don't want to have her keep being in the middle, because my SO doesn't have any friends for themselves after being here 2 years. We get into a spat, we both start bitching at her about the other person.

I try to encourage my SO to participate in clubs and organizations since we live in a big city and there are plenty, but they get defensive and angry when I bring it up. I don't want to drag them to clubs I think they'll like because it'll inevitably end up with me having more friends and them with half-friends. I don't know how to get my SO to really, truly understand why they need their own fucking friends.
