MELVIN: Hello.
CAROL: Yeah... Well...
MELVIN: How you doing?
CAROL: I can trust my brain.
MELVIN: That seems like a good choice.
CAROL: I don't know whether I'm being sensible or hard on you.
MELVIN: The two might go together.
CAROL: See. There's an example. I don't know whether you're being cute or crazy now.
MELVIN: Cute.
CAROL: You don't have to answer everything I say. Just listen to me. Okay?
