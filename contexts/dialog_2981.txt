BASQUIAT: What do you think?
ALBERT MILO: I like the one with the dragon's heads a lot. But the black one's filled up with too many heads... I'd take some of them out. I think you're painting too fast. I wouldn't put in so many heads. Let it breathe a bit.
BASQUIAT: It's always how you would do it. This is my version.
ALBERT MILO: You're right. It's your version. You should come over to the studio sometime.
BASQUIAT: Why, so you could humiliate me?
ALBERT MILO: No, I wanted to make a painting of you.
