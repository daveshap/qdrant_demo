MAMA: Never mind. I'm glad it's gone. Made the store feel strange. Who'd make such a thing?
JOEY: Fine. Fine. But can you tell us anything about it?
MAMA: It was part of a job-lot. Some loony- bin they shut down. Unclaimed stuff.
JOEY: What else came with it? Anything still here?
MAMA: Sure. Just papers, photos. Stuff nobody'd ever want.
JOEY: Can we see?
MAMA: You gonna buy?
JOEY: I don't know. Maybe.
MAMA: Right at the back there. Middle shelves. Coupla folders. Nice stuff. I'd do you a good price.
