Understanding constant current LED drivers (ac to DC) I am trying to understand the way constant current LED drivers work. Lets say I have a driver with these specs:Description:Power: 18WOutput Voltage: DC 36-63VOutput Current; 300mAInput Voltage: AC 85 - 265VI can attach one LED light (which accepts 300 mA current) of 18 watts or 3 LED lights (each of which accept 300 mA current) of 6 watts each (in series) to the driver and it should work. In both these cases, the output voltage will be 60 V so that power demands are being met. Q1 - Am I right up to this point?Now suppose, I want to use the same driver to power up two 6 watts LED lights. I can still do so by wiring them in series. Output voltage in that case will be 40 V. Q2 - Am I right?Now lets say I want to light up a single 6 W bulb which requires 300 mA. Q3 - What will happen in this case? In order to drive 6 W LED, the output voltage needs to be 20 V but the driver can give output in the range of 36 V to 63 V.
