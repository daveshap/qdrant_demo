DUFF: I said, I come to town with a girl.
WILL: Plannin' on getting married?
DUFF: No.
WILL: 'Don't sound so sure.
DUFF: Well, matter of fact, I done a lot of bangin' 'round.
WILL: Yeah. That's how me an' your mother got started. I'm tellin' you, boy, you ain't got a chance without dough. They take it all away from you.
LEE: Pour your own trouble, Will.
WILL: Your mother used to lay for her boss, boy. Did you know that?
LEE: Shut up, Will.
WILL: Okay, so what's a girl supposed to do? Me not workin' and her cleanin' house for a white man. I'm tellin' you, boy, keep away from marriage. Ya gotta stay light on your feet or you won't make it.
WILL: Is she good in the hay? No point marryin' her just to find out. Is there, baby?
LEE: If you don't quit it, Will, I'm leaving.
WILL: You're breaking my heart. Got to see a man about a dog.
