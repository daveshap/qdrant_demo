How to copy files without copying Alternate Data Streams I want to backup my infected Windows system's files before formatting it all and reinstalling the system. I would do it from a Linux Live USB. I've heard that one should be careful in copying only the files and not the alternate data streams or they would help the malware persist when reinstalling the system.From Linux, how do I copy the files safely without carrying the alternate data streams with them?
