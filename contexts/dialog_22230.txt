WELLES: No, but I can imagine. What am I today? A puny upstart" or a "spoiled dilettante" -- no
MANK: And how is the country to feel when this industry continues to employ bedraggled foreigners and swarthy refugees instead of real Americans? Doesn't Hollywood know there's a Depression on? Don't real Americans deserve work?""
WELLES: Well, at least she's off KANE today
MANK: No she's not. Don't you get it, ya lunk? She's using code language to the studio bosses. Bedraggled foreigners and swarthy refugees" -- who the hell do you think she's talking about?"
WELLES: Hedy Lamarr?
MANK: Jews. She's talking about Jews.
MANK: Who owns this town? Who runs every goddamn studio? The tribe, baby. These fuckers hear the word Jew" and they start sweating. Like Ester Williams' pool they start sweating."
WELLES: So they're Jews. . .
MANK: This is just the first shot. Maestro. Sooner or later she's gonna use the word. And all those boys know that there is only one thing this country hates more than the coloreds and that's the Jews.
WELLES: Christ.
MANK: Me, I'm proud to be a Jew, I got no problem. You don't like it, fuck you. But with these guys it's like a dirty word. All they wanna be is good red- white-and-blue Americans, and the way they see it you can't be a good American and a Jew. So Sam Goldfish becomes Sam Goldwyn and David Selznick becomes David 0. Selznick -- like anyone's gonna think he's Irish for fuck's sake--
WELLES: What does this have to do with--?
MANK: Believe you me, they're gonna do anything -- and I mean absolutely anything -- to stop that word from gettin' out.
WELLES: What?! Are they going to kill me? Is that what they're going to do?!
