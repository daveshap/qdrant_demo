Getting rejected....but why
So my work history is primarily with non profit and children. My roles have primarily been executive and administrative mixed with some event coordinating. 

I’m currently GA certified and I’m also working on getting certified in SQL, but I’m trying to break out of the non profit/working with children world to something with growth both professionally and financially. 

Are there some things I should be considering?
