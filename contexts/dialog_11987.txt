ELLIOT: Oh, you-you have that one?
LEE: Yeah.
ELLIOT: Oh, I would love to hear it.
LEE: Oh, and Holly met a wonderful man who loves opera. An architect.
ELLIOT: Oh, that's nice. I'd love to see her wind up settled. She's a tense one.
LEE: Isn't that beautiful?
ELLIOT: I know this. Bach. F Minor Concerto. It's one of my favorites.
ELLIOT: Uh...did you ever get around to e.e. cummings?
LEE: Yes, he's just adorable.
LEE: They have a very large gay clientele, you know, where I get my teeth cleaned, and...all the hygienists now wear gloves because they're afraid of AIDS.
ELLIOT: Oh, right.
ELLIOT: Did you ever get around to the poem on page a hundred and twelve?
LEE: Yes, it made me cry it was so beautiful...so romantic.
