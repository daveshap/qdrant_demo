GRETCHEN: Babies cry because they're afraid of the dark. And because they have no memories... for all they know... every night could be the last forever. Like, perpetual darkness.
DONNIE: Why not just buy your baby a night light?
GRETCHEN: That's not good enough. You've got to go back in time and take all those hours of darkness and pain and replace them... with whatever you wanted.
DONNIE: With, like, images?
GRETCHEN: Like... a Hawaiian sunset... the Grand Canyon. Things that remind you how beautiful the world can be.
DONNIE: You know... we've been going together for a week and a half...
GRETCHEN: And what?
DONNIE: Well...
GRETCHEN: You want to kiss me...
DONNIE: That's alright... I understand.
GRETCHEN: No... Donnie, wait. I've never...
DONNIE: I always wanted it to be at a time when... when it reminds you how beautiful the world can be.
GRETCHEN: Yeah. And right now there's some fat guy over there watching us.
