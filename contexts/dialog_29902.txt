TERESA: When's the next business trip, big fella?
LELAND: Soon. How about next time we party with the girlfriends you told me about?
TERESA: I can arrange that. I like that.
TERESA: What are you doing?
LELAND: Who am I?
TERESA: I don't know.
LELAND: That's right.
LAURA: Dad... Dad... Who was that? How do you know him? He looked familiar. Have I met him?
LELAND: No, you haven't met him. Have you met him?
LAURA: No.
LELAND: We're late to get to your mother.
LAURA: Just sit here for a moment. You seem very upset.
LELAND: Guy just pulls up out of the blue... I mean... what is this world coming to?
TERESA: What's wrong?
LELAND: Nothing, I chickened out.
LAURA: Are you sure you're okay?
LELAND: Yes.
LAURA: Dad?
LELAND: Yes.
LAURA: Did you come home during the day last week?
LELAND: No.
LAURA: Oh, I thought I saw you.
LELAND: You know, I did come home, come to think of it, on Thursday. I had a severe headache and I was driving in the neighborhood so I just darted in and out of the house. Where were you, Laura? I didn't see you?
LAURA: I was down the street.
