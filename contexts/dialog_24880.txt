MILLIE: My poor baby!
BUZZ: You see what you did? Take your ball and get out.
THEO: 99 years, 241 days, 15 hours, and 20 minutes of no bowling. Alfie shuffles up to the self-serve island and begins wiping it down.
ALFIE: Find your bowler?
THEO: Yeah, but it didn't go so good. He wasn't the man I thought he'd be. Theo is trying to affix the lid on his cup, but his hands are trembling, spilling some of the coffee.
ALFIE: My father used to say to me Never..." no
THEO: Maybe I should have left the ball in the car.
MILLIE: He's not here.
THEO: I'm sorry about Zeus, Millie.
MILLIE: This is a sign! Someone's coming to take Buzz away from me. I don't know if you're the guy or what, but I'm not letting it happen. I'm leaving him first.
THEO: I couldn't kill Buzz. I need his help. Theo helps Millie load suitcases into the trunk of her car.
MILLIE: Buzz Fazeli never helps anybody but himself.
THEO: He's my father, Millie.
MILLIE: He's no father to you.
MILLIE: Careful with that one. He won't tell me anything, but I know there's something strange going on over at the lanes. If you ask me, I'd say the old fart wants to die.
THEO: Where can I find him?
MILLIE: The Peter Pan.
