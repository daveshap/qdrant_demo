BOWLER: And then one day, he didn't come home. The police said it was an accident. But cargo containers don't just fall on people. He was murdered... After that I fell apart. I dropped out of school, became a mud wrestler, married and divorced a jerk. When my mother died I hit bottom... but then, when I was cleaning out her attic, I found my father's old bowling bag and costume, almost like he'd left them there for me... and I knew what I had to do.
SHOVELER: So who killed him?
BOWLER: The Disco Boys.
FURIOUS: You know something? Those guys are really starting TO PISS ME OFF!
SHOVELER: But there's still only six of us.
FURIOUS: SO WHAT?
BOWLER: That's two more than the Fantastic Four.
FURIOUS: Half a Dirty Dozen!
