Someone help me
 Tbh,I kinda feel very sorry for myself. Idk why,I just don’t believe it tbh. Until the end of the day I said today’s my birthday to someone else and everyone then said happy birthday,but it’s worthless to me now. I got surprised with cake and some gift cards but they personally didn’t make me happy. Yes I was happy but it just...idk just made me feel worthless sometimes. I got a reason why...I’ve done some bad in my life and they accept me for that,they don’t accept me as a friend,they only accept me as a weirdo and a annoying loser. I’ll accept my fate and be a statistic after all. I have ambitions that are not good and aren’t that ambitious at all....so yeah.I need motivation and training. ☹️
