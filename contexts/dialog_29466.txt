MAN 1: Well, Mr. Renton, I see that you attended the Royal Edinburgh College.
RENTON: Indeed, yes, those halcyon days.
MAN 1: One of Edinburgh's finest schools.
RENTON: Oh, yes, indeed. I look back on my time there with great fondness and affection. The debating society, the first eleven, the soft know of willow on leather --
MAN 1: I'm an old boy myself, you know?
RENTON: Oh, really?
MAN 1: Do you recall the school motto?
RENTON: Of course, the motto, the motto --
MAN 1: Strive, hope, believe and conquer.
RENTON: Exactly. Those very words have been my guiding light in what is, after all, a dark and often hostile world.
