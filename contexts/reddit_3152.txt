For those that started careers that have nothing to do with their BA/MA Degree's, how are you doing now?
Hello everyone!

This is my first time posting in here so please let me know if this post is breaking any rules/not fit for this sub.

I've (23F) graduated with BA in psychology May 2017 and have been working in clinical research since. While humanities will always have my heart I don't feel like I'm getting the mental stimulation that I crave. I don't want to go into counseling or clinical work which basically makes me degree worthless. In school my professors constantly urged me to get into STEM/Bio-Med because of my strong analytical skills with research methods and stats. Now I'm not to sure what i want to pursue for my masters but more so I don't know what I want to make a career out of. 

My question to all of you is with someone as young as me, is there anything you would have changed or done differently when it come down to deciding what career you wanted? Tell me about the degree's you've obtained and where you're working now. I am open to listening to everyone's achievements, and also anyone's downfalls as well because I've learned this life journey doesn't exactly have a set rule book.

\- Are you working in the career path that you set yourself up for? Was it what you thought it would be?

\- Is this the career you wanted or did you end up on a total different career path?

\- Is your line of work fulfilling your salary needs?

\- Does your career give you the satisfaction you thought it would?
