How do you survive the 9-5 grind?
A bit about me and my situation: I’m a 41 year old female with a unique and creative job that I enjoy but there are downsides too: lots of multitasking, boss is awesome but disorganized, we’re understaffed so it can be stressful, and I sit all day which is bad for my already messed up back. But the biggest downside is my commute (1 hour each way on 3 different crowded and unreliable trains in NYC and no car). One plus is I get a lot of reading done! I would love to work part time there and focus on other creative pursuits but I need my benefits and I’m drowning in student loan debt so I also need reliable income (and lots of it). I just lose so much time in my life and am zapped of energy by the time I get home. So I stay up late to maximize my “me time” (mostly tv or artsy stuff) and then I’m exhausted in the morning. I lack the motivation to exercise or socialize much which I know is bad but I feel so drained all the time. I would love to live closer but it’s not an option right now because my partner’s son is in a great school district. I don’t want to quit (I have great benefits, a lovely work environment, caring employers, and the work is rewarding). Also my job is very niche which means it will be very challenging to find something comparable. But I’m also I’m going crazy and I’m depressed. Any advice? I think we’ll look back on 9-5 work in 100 years and marvel at its cruelty.
