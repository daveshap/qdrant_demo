GITTES: Where?
EVELYN: Just... I have to.
GITTES: And I want to know where.
EVELYN: Please don't be angry... believe me, it's got nothing to do with you.
GITTES: Where are you going?
EVELYN: Please!... Trust me this much... I'll be back. Look, there is something I should tell you. The fishing club that old lady mentioned, the pieces off the flag.
GITTES: The Albacore Club.
EVELYN: It has to do with my father.
GITTES: I know.
EVELYN: He owns it. You know?
GITTES: I saw him.
EVELYN: You saw my fa... father? When?
GITTES: This morning.
EVELYN: You didn't tell me.
GITTES: There hasn't been a lot of time.
EVELYN: What did he say? What did he say?
GITTES: That you were jealous, and he was worried about what you might do.
EVELYN: Do? To who?
GITTES: Mulwray's girlfriend, for one thing. He wanted to know where she was.
EVELYN: I want you to listen to me. My father is a very dangerous man. You don't know how dangerous. You don't know how crazy.
GITTES: Give me an example.
EVELYN: You may think you know what's going on, but you don't.
GITTES: That's what your father said. You're telling me he's in back of this whole thing?
EVELYN: It's possible.
GITTES: Including the death of your husband?
EVELYN: It's possible. Please don't ask me any more questions now. Just wait, wait for me. I'll be back. I need you here.
GITTES: Okay, give me the keys.
EVELYN: You bastard.
GITTES: It's either that or you drive to the police yourself.
EVELYN: The police?
GITTES: C'mon, Mrs. Mulwray. You've got your husband's girlfriend tied up in there!
EVELYN: She's not tied up!
GITTES: You know what I mean. You're keeping her there against her will.
EVELYN: I am not!
GITTES: Then let's go talk to her.
