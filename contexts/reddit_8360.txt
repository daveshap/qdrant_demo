It seems as though Senate Republicans just suspend the rules about suspending committee rules. Is that what actually happened?
And if so, what's the larger framework for making that possible?  Here's where they [suspended the rules](http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/01/politics/republicans-vote-to-suspend-committee-rules-advance-mnuchin-price-nominations/index.html?adkey=bn).  This seems to be the [rule about suspending the rules](http://www.rules.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?p=RuleV).  

The language I'm curious about is in bold.  

"1. No motion to suspend, modify, or amend any rule, or any part thereof, shall be in order, **except on one day's notice in writing, specifying precisely the rule or part proposed to be suspended**, modified, or amended, and the purpose thereof. Any rule may be suspended without notice by the **unanimous consent of the Senate**, except as otherwise provided by the rules."

Was 1 day written notice provided? and if so, to and from whom?  Was there unanimous consent of the (entire?) Senate?
