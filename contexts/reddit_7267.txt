Is an edX course certificate worth buying?
I'm currently doing the ''IT Fundamentals for Business Professionals'' course on edX and I'm wondering if I should pay for the certificate or not.

Is this a certificate that employers would actually care about? And do you think that even if I didn't pay for the certificate I could put the course on my resume?

If you have experience with edX and their certificates, I'm would love to hear about it!
