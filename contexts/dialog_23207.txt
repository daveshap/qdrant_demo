SOMERSET: Dear Detectives
CAPTAIN: Announcing what?
SOMERSET: There are seven deadly sins. Gluttony, wrath, greed...
CAPTAIN: So what? This victim...
SOMERSET: ... envy, sloth, pride and lust. Seven.
CAPTAIN: Hey, so gluttony is one of the seven deadly sins. But, this was a fat guy. The killer may have felt this was the just best way to torture him. And, writing on the walls happens all the time. It's like the fashionable thing to do.
SOMERSET: One is gluttony.
MILLS: This is his stuff. I've been out in the cold all day.
SOMERSET: This is a premeditated puzzle, and it's only the beginning.
