The Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Acts, what now, what then?
The Congress and President of the United States of America have recently passed and signed into law the Hong Kong human rights and democracy act. This is a big thing over here.

The Chinese Communist Party of the People’s Republic of China has not been turning a blind eye to this, of course. Since the discussion of the bill China [responded that the bill "fully reveals the ill intentions of some people in the United States to mess up Hong Kong and contain China's development.](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3030403/beijing-vows-retaliate-after-us-hong-kong-human-rights-bill). After the House passed the Act, Beijing condemned the move and said [it would take countermeasures](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3033266/china-warns-countermeasures-over-us-bill-supporting-hong-kong) and today after the bill was signed it reiterated that [China will take firm countermeasures](https://mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN1Y204Z) in response.

I might have a political bias but to would like to stay focused on factual and legal discussions. I raise the following question/discussion points.

1. The Chinese Communist Party claims the bill is a “serious interference in Chinese affairs.” Is there any legal basis for that statement, or are there any legal definition which defines what is interfering in a country’s internal affairs?

2. The bill is triggered by the massive ongoing unrest in Hong Kong. China [claims the protests in Hong Kong is fuelled to a large extent by “foreign interference”](https://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/short-reads/article/3031240/decrying-foreign-interference-china-should) What are, if any, some evidence that the protests are actually a result of foreign interferences?

2. This is not the first time the Chinese Communist Party has raised a finger and told others not to interfere in their internal affairs. Some exhibits [here](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/1938622/stop-interfering-hong-kong-affairs-beijing-warns-european), and [here](https://www.cityam.com/top-mp-denies-british-interference-in-hong-kong-after-chinese-ambassadors-warning/amp/). Is there any evidence that the People’s Republic of China under ‘foreign interferences’, or if there’s none, why are they claiming that so often?

3. A little speculative question but I believe it can be answered factually: China has warned US of ‘firm countermeasures’. Without jumping into speculations, what are the current tools and cars on the table that the Chinese Communist Party can use as countermeasures in what they view as interference from a hostile foreign nation?

Thank you!
