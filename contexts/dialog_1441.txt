JEAN: Oh, something. . romantic?
BATEMAN: No, silly. Forget it. I'll make them. Thanks.
JEAN: I'll do it.
BATEMAN: No. No. Be a doll and just get me a Perrier, okay?
JEAN: You look nice today.
JEAN: Yes?
BATEMAN: Is that the Ransom file? Thanks. Don't wear that outfit again.
JEAN: Ummm...what? I didn't hear you.
BATEMAN: I said Do not wear that outfit again." Wear a dress. A skirt or something."
JEAN: You don't like this, I take it?
BATEMAN: Come on, you're prettier than that.
JEAN: Thanks, Patrick.
