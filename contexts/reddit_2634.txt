When the job ad says 'tell us about yourself', what kind of information do they want to hear?
Do they want you to answer in a professional manner or in a casual 'I like watching movies and Thai food' type of way? Or maybe of a mix of both... but then how do you go from 'I can type at 50wpm' into 'The last book I read was \_\_\_\_'?

I've never been good at answering these types of questions so if you can provide a short example that'd be most appreciated.

Edit: The 'tell us about yourself' question was followed by 'For example, how do you usually spend your Tuesday nights?'

Edit: I took all your advice and finally bit the bullet and applied. Thanks for all the help and suggestions, you guys! Hope they like what I wrote!
