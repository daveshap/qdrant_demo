The fact that i'm shy is the main reason why i'm suicidal
I wish i could say hi to someone without thinking about it 30 minutes beforehand

I wish i could ask someone a basic question without nearly breaking down

I wish i didn't have to rely on other people approaching me first, so i could make friends by myself

I wish i was confident enough to approach girls without my brain sabotaging me constantly

I wish i could be confident enough to believe that a girl will someday love me

I wish i could walk in public without believing that everyone is judging me and without my heart going absolutely crazy

I wish i could go to the gym, but i always pussy out because i believe everyone there will make fun of me and try to beat me up

I just wish i could be a normal human being
