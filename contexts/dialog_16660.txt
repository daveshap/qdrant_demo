MONICA: Early night for you, isn't it?
QUINCY: I was about to ask you the same thing, going out with a college boy and all.
MONICA: Mulholland Drive.
QUINCY: Figures.
MONICA: So what dead-end street did you and Shawnee hit?
QUINCY: None of your business.
MONICA: Well, I'm sure she kept her word and left you satisfied.
QUINCY: That what you think?
MONICA: Why?
QUINCY: Cause I don't just stick my dick in anything.
