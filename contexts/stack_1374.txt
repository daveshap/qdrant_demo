Bug zapper project with counter I have this evil thought that building a fly zapper with a counter every time it works.There are two ways in my mind, first one is hacking a bug zapper product which I already have (hand grip style, will use 9v adapter instead its battery). But my question is, how do I put a counter on its high voltage end. Is there any way to limit a proportional voltage at the output for safe arduino reading?Other way is the capacitor voltage multiplier path, which is easy to read for me but I don't know which would be easiest to make.
