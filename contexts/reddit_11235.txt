I'm the friend that doesn't matter. I could have easily left any time last night and no one would have noticed or cared.
I'm just there

No one really wants to hang out, I just get lucky, I happened to be in the right place and no one's rude enough to protest.

my friends all have friends who theyd rather be with.

everyone i thought i was close with are more  more outgoing and have more (closer, better) friends.

i just ride along when i can

i dont like to talk to people, Im not good at it

When I do talk to people I feel like I come off as an obnoxious asshole.

i dont hug anyone hello or goodbye

I don't see anyone at school, I'm homeschooled. I have an early curfew because my parents are old and wait up for me.

My "friends" are there for each other but not for me. They help eachother out but no one notices I need help too.

they get into groups and im just left inbetween

ive left so many places without anyone noticing

people joke about me being quiet or whatever, but seriously it fucking sucks
