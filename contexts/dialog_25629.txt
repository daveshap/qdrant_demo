FOX: We're growing very concerned back here. There's no use pretending otherwise. We're rapidly approaching a 'condition red.' People are beginning to ask difficult questions.
SHERMIN: I'll make this as simple as I can, George. They disappeared.
FOX: I don't care where you're from you just can't disappear into thin air.
SHERMIN: George, listen to what you're saying. This thing's changed itself into a man. Disappearing may not be that big a deal.
FOX: So far you've let it cross the heart of America. For two days it has been absorbing information that is detrimental to our security. I don't see the humor in that.
SHERMIN: Maybe... look, this is just something to think about... from what I got at the shopping center, it was more scared than anything else... I don't feel it's as big a threat as you think it is...
FOX: Is that what's affecting your performance?
SHERMIN: I'm not being unpatriotic, and I'm doing my damndest to catch them. Bell's up on 80 and I'm down here on 70 past Grand Junction. They're heading west. If they're not flying we have a damn good chance of getting them. All I'm asking is that you people think about it.
FOX: You just do your job, Shermin. We'll make the policy.
