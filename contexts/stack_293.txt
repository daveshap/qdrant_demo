Is there a way to encrypt a folder and then only allow certain processes to have access to that folder? I'm aware of technique for creating encrypted folders using disk utility.But I believe once it is unlocked and mounted, any process owned as you or root could read that folder.I'm looking for a way to encrypt a folder and then only allow certain procs access.Here's a scenario:   Google chrome keeps a directory for cache data, bookmarks, history and the like.I'd like to create an encrypted folder for this that is only unlocked for chrome.   And keep it encrypted for any backup software or scanners... things that could potentially be running as root that could override an filesystem perms.
