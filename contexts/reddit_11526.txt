Today's my 19th birthday and it kind of sucks.
I try so hard not to whine but this sub is exactly what this is for, right? 

It's my birthday today and I am in college, state college so I still live at home which is good because it saves me money and my parents money too, because they are planning on getting divorced but can't afford to yet because neither of them can keep the house on their own. They tolerate each other for my sake but they aren't very nice to each other anymore and it sucks. 

They are taking me and a friend to dinner for my birthday tonight and I really don't want to go, but I can't say that. They have enough problems and an ungrateful kid is the last thing they need. 

Oh and the only guy I've ever loved, like truly loved, for over two years, has recently told me that he no longer wants to even be my friend. I met him the summer before HS started and basically had no interaction with any other guys until just recently and I've discovered that I don't know how to interact with other guys and that is pretty depressing too.

And lastly, I'm on this dating site and get lots of messages from guys just wanting to hook up but a few nice ones and then this morning, on my birthday I get an offer to make lots of money if I make a sex tape, give a guy oral or have sex with an old dude! Yay, my life has amounted to being solicited online for sex, which I've never had, so let's add that to the mix.

So yea, that's what's bothering me today.
