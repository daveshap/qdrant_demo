Risky Student Housing Options, help!
I have two options. 

1. On campus housing guaranteed 2 semesters. (over $700/month)
2. Basement suite one year lease. 7min walk to school. (under $600/month)

Tricky part:
I have co-op terms randomly placed, so like this school year I have one second semester. Next year I will have one first semester and then that summer. So if I got with option 2, I will need to sublet to a female (landlords only request) during these 4 month co-op terms. Usually people who take those sublets are other students who are coming back from a co-op and need a place to stay while they are back at school, or else exchange students that come for a semester. So if I don't find someone to sublet to then I have to pay empty rent. Whereas with option 1 I can just leave with no financial penalty. However, the next year I will have to apply first come first serve to on campus housing for second semester which may or may not work in my favour depending how many spots they have open. 

Please help me decide
