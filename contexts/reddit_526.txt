I really like this guy...
I met a guy I really like at a party but the first time I met him I was drunk and very clingy (he called me clingy to a friend that also happened to be his) and I was hugging him around the waist all night ... now we are friends and go to the same parties occasionally and talk sometimes at them but I still really like him, however he likes another girl who he’s linking with but she says she’s not quite ready for a relationship with him (I just know this the girl and I aren’t friends). I’m so embarrassed and I wanna go out with him but I think I’ve ruined my chances, what do I do?
