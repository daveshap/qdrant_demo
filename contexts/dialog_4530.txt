MR. HENRY: But you're thieves. It's what you are.
ANTHONY: Yeah.
MR. HENRY: It's an esoteric journey.
MR. HENRY: We're renegades from despair.
ANTHONY: Can I ask you something, Mr. Henry?
MR. HENRY: Absolutely.
ANTHONY: Why'd you want to help us?
MR. HENRY: Because I was like you once. And there was no one there to help me.

ANTHONY: Hopefully this trip'll go a little smoother than the last one.
ANTHONY: Or I might end up with a broken nose.
DIGNAN: Did that hurt?
