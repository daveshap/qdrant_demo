PARRISH: Our first annual report, must be thirty-five years ago now, I owned two stations, I wrote down a state- ment of purpose, that one day you would wake up to a Parrish radio station, read a Parrish paper at breakfast, catch our news on tele- vision during the day, and go to bed with one of our books or magazines and you would always be told the truth and in the bargain, have a good time.
DREW: That's great! Wait 'til I show it to Bontecou.
BONTECOU: Bill, thanks for coming over... And how're you doing today, Drew? You've got a firecracker here, the kid's really set the table.
PARRISH: Good, good. Glad to hear it.
BONTECOU: We've met before, y'know, that White House function, the President had you on his right and you know where I was?
PARRISH: I'm sorry, I don't recall --
BONTECOU: Left field somewhere. Well, Bill, I want to come in from the outfield, bat cleanup like you have, learn the plush ropes --
PARRISH: I thought you were buying my company.
BONTECOU: Oh, Mr. Parrish, I could never buy Parrish Communications. I could pay for it, of course, but it would always have your imprint.
