Can y'all help me understand the recent change of the definition of "domestic violence" and "sexual assault" by the DOJ?
["The Trump administration quietly changed the definition of both domestic violence and sexual assault back in April but the move has only just surfaced."](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/trump-domestic-abuse-sexual-assault-definition-womens-rights-justice-department-a8744546.html)

&#x200B;

"The Trump Justice Department’s definition only considers physical harm that constitutes a felony or misdemeanour to be domestic violence – meaning other forms of domestic violence such as psychological abuse, coercive control and manipulation no longer fall under the department’s definition."

&#x200B;

What are the practical implications of such a change? And what are arguments for/against different definitions?

I'll admit that I assumed that "domestic violence" required "physical harm". So I'm a bit confused about the whole situation and discussion.
