Paid 20th month following
I have been offered a job where the pay is on the 20th month following.

So if i work in May 2020 i get paid on 20th June 2020 for that month's work.

There are other questionable terms in the contract.

So I'm wondering if i should accept the job or whether these are probably bad employers.

Does anyone have experience of this?
