DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK: I know you --
MEMPHIS: You know my back -
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK: You want to come along quiet?
MEMPHIS: How's Atley -- ?
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK: Leg's all banged-up. He made a stupid play ... He'll limp around the yard up at Folsom. But Astricky will be there to take care of him. With their priors, they're looking at a serious bounce --
MEMPHIS: Let them go --
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK: How's that?
MEMPHIS: Let them go. And I'll leave ...
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK: You'll leave -- ?
MEMPHIS: You don't have anything on me. A misdee auto-theft. I got no record. I'll be out in three days, and back at it. Or you let them go, and I give you my word. I'm gone. And without the ringleader ... Your tee-times have just grown exponentially...
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK: I don't golf...
MEMPHIS: You have my word...
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK: Get out of here, then. Now.
