First semester as a TA - I am terrible at it. Rant/Advice needed!
Hi guys,

This is my first semester in grad school as well as my first time ever teaching. I felt like it was hard enough having to try to teach in person, and now with remote teaching I feel like I am doing an even worse job. So our department has many TAs for the lab we are teaching, and I pretty much have to just base my lab instructions off of what they have already done since I am still new and learning the ropes. 

I feel like I don't belong in grad school. I make stupid mistakes that sometimes my students have to ask me to clarify, my speech gets messed up when I am teaching, the software we use for our labs messes up literally every single class, grading and trying to maintain consistency gives me so much anxiety that I procrastinate on it until the last minute.


That's just the tip of the iceberg. I'm a terrible TA and I honestly don't know where to start in learning how to improve. Since we are near the end of the semester I probably should have improved by now, but I always walk away from a teaching and giving labs like a huge failure. 

Has anyone else felt this way? What did you do to improve? Also, has moving to remote teaching impacted your TA abilities in any way?

Thanks
