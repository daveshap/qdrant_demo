another twin or the other twin? Usually, when there are two things, we say \"one\and \"the other\".  However, I came across the following expression:<blockquote>  one twin to another.</blockquote>Of course, a pair of twins is made up with two people. Therefore, if we say \"one\" pointing to one of them, the one left should be called \"the other\right?
