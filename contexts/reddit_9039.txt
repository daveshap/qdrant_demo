What policies have shown positive outcomes in solving the economic problems Venezuela has?
There is [currently](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-36319877) great political turmoil in Venezuela, with Guaido claiming heâ€™s the president while Maduro [backed by the military](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2019/01/26/why-venezuela-military-leaders-show-strong-support-maduro.html)) claims to still be the rightful president.

Meanwhile, the economy has spiraled into [hyperinflation](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevehanke/2019/01/01/venezuelas-hyperinflation-hits-80000-per-year-in-2018/#a85b68e45725) of 80 000%.

Where does a country go from here, especially from a financial perspective, to stabilize the nation? What did previous countries do to get from hyperinflation to a normal situation?
