Retrieving deleted records from feature dataset in enterprise geodatabase? I have an enterprise geodatabase with many feature datasets. I was editing one of the feature datasets and accidentally deleted some records from there. I did not realize and stop editing after saving it. When I opened my attribute table, I do not see those selected records. Is there anyway that I can retrieve those deleted ones in the appropriate data sets?
