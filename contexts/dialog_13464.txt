GEORGE: And speaking of which, you have those market share charts Mr. Shackley was asking about?
BEN: Gotcha George, not a problem. Tomorrow. Hey, you want to start covering the old filmed entertainment sector yourself?
GEORGE: Ben you know that's your territory - and I wouldn't dream to trespass - you're the expert. Hey, how do you think Paramount's gonna do with that Blatty novel, what's it called? The Exorcist?
BEN: Overpriced bomb, cost over $6 million -- no stars, and no one's into the horror genre these days anyway. I'm advising the company recommend reducing positions there. It's disaster films that are gonna stay at the top.
GEORGE: Brilliant. Hey, you heading out a little early today?
BEN: Got a meeting uptown.
GEORGE: Right o'.
BEN: Up the organization! Bastard.
