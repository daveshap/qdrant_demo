RATH: Breakfast.
ELECTRA: Why don't you bring it out here? It's beautiful out here.
ELECTRA: I know what you are thinking. I'm not going to disappear, okay? I'm not going anywhere, just down there, to that beautiful beach. I got to get out of this room, just for a little while.
RATH: Okay.
ELECTRA: Really?
RATH: He won't be looking for you. Just be careful. Buy a book. Keep your sunglasses on.
ELECTRA: Book. Sunglasses. Great.
RATH: You should knock.
ELECTRA: Sorry.
RATH: How was the beach?
ELECTRA: The beach? It was nice.
