NURSE HUMPHRIES: Is everyone here?
RAY: Hey, where's Claude? I don't see Claude!
NURSE HUMPHRIES: Stay calm, Ray. We'll find him. Claude! Has anyone seen Claude?
RAY: He must still be in there.
NURSE HUMPHRIES: Wait for the firemen!
RAY: It'll be too late.
NURSE HUMPHRIES: You can't go in there, Ray! You'll never make it!
RAY: I'm going in for him. He'd do the same for me.
