How do you deal with becoming jaded?
When I first entered into the workforce, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed 10 years ago, I had a very idealistic view of the corporate world. I trusted everyone and I thought everyone operated above-board, all the time. 

Now, 10 years in, I’ve simply seen too much and I’ve reached “jaded” status. I’ve seen good people get sabotaged and fired, I’ve witnessed and experienced sexual harassment, and I’ve watched the destruction of office politics take its toll. 

So, when people talk about things like “show company loyalty” or “align with your peers” or “trust your boss”, I just can’t take any of it seriously anymore. You can follow “the rules” in the workplace and still get screwed over. You can build rapport and still get sabotaged. You can do everything right on paper, and still get treated as nothing more than replaceable cog. 

If you’ve experienced this, how do you deal with it? How do you reconcile the fact that you really can’t trust anyone at work, and that so much of what you see on the surface is total BS?
