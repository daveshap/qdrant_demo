MOZART: Leave that alone!
SCHIKANEDER: Wolfi!
MOZART: Put it down!
SCHIKANEDER: What is this?
MOZART: Put it down, I said! It's nothing for you.
SCHIKANEDER: Oh! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! What have you got for me? Is it finished?
MOZART: What?
SCHIKANEDER: What? The vaudeville, what'd you think?
MOZART: Yes.
SCHIKANEDER: Can I see it?
MOZART: No.
SCHIKANEDER: Why not?
MOZART: Because there's nothing to see.
SCHIKANEDER: Look, I asked you if we could start rehearsal next week and you said yes.
MOZART: Well, we can.
SCHIKANEDER: So let me see it. Where is it?
