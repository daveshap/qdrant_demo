First Receptionist job without experience! Tips for my first day tomorrow?
Never worked as a receptionist, I got selected to work at a hotel, in the spa area. I'll be working as a receptionist, and am quite nervous because I've never done this before. Any tips that former/active receptionists can give me? Will I need to learn Excel at an intermediate level? What are the things I need to know best?

I'll be reading you guys! Thanks in advance.
