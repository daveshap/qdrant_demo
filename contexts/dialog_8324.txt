GIN: I'll need that.
MAC: No one <u>needs</u> anything except food and shelter. The rest we just want.
GIN: This isn't a good time to hear your personal philosophy.
MAC: Don't worry, I can get rid of this. No trace. And I'll even go fifty fifty, we're partners aren't we?
GIN: No. It's a down payment.
MAC: On what? Another job?
GIN: We get the Mask I'll tell you.
MAC: A partner with secrets isn't much of a partner.
GIN: Without the Mask it doesn't matter.
MAC: So the Mask is part of the down payment too. Must be a really big job.
GIN: Let's just see how we do.
MAC: So you're testing <u>me</u> now?
GIN: Oh, I think you can do it. Probably.
