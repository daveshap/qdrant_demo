Are EdX courses valid without verified certificates? And how valuable are LinkedIn certificates for an experienced job seeker
If I do edX coursee without going the verified route and finish the course without buying the certificate, will my course still be valid? Meaning, can I still say that I completed this course on LinkedIn, College application or CV/Resume? 

Also, if an experienced job seeker does some paid course on LinkedIn, how valuable is it to him in his job search and should he use it on their resume or profile
