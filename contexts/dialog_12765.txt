BURNS: This is a pleasure, Mr. Baldwin, and I'm sorry about the mistake.
BRUCE: 
BURNS: Oh, I thought there was something funny... You see, Bruce, you don't mind if I call you Bruce, do you? After all, we're practically related --
BRUCE: Mr. -- well -- no -- no -- not at all.
BURNS: You see, my wife -- I mean, your wife -- that is, I mean Hildy -- had led me to expect that she was marrying a much older man.
BRUCE: Oh.
BURNS: But I see, she didn't mean old in years. You always carry an umbrella, Bruce?
BRUCE: Well, er -- it looked a little cloudy this morning.
BURNS: That's right. -- Rubbers, too, I hope? A man ought to be prepared for any emergency.
BURNS: Attaboy! Come on, Bruce.
BRUCE: Where are we going?
BURNS: Where are we going? I'm going to buy you two lunch -- didn't Hildy tell you?
BRUCE: No -- she didn't.
BURNS: Just wanted to surprise you, I guess. Down! After you, Bruce! Come on, Hildy, my treat!
HILDY: I suppose I can't call this off without creating a scene -- but remember, it's your last fling.
BURNS: How do you like that? Here I am being nice to you and your sweet-heart and that's the thanks I get!
