Historically, have SCOTUS rulings regarding protected classes and employment led to shifts in the implementation of employment law, such as more wrongful termination legal rulings? Or are such rulings mostly symbolic victories?
SCOTUS recently [ruled](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/15/us/gay-transgender-workers-supreme-court.html?auth=login-google) 6-3 that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 applies to employment discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, and that is unlawful to fire someone for either. This decision is being [hailed](https://www.npr.org/2020/06/15/863498848/supreme-court-delivers-major-victory-to-lgbtq-employees) as a significant victory for trans and gay rights.

However, many [states](https://www.rocketlawyer.com/article/what-states-are-at-will-employment-states-ps.rl) have [at-will employment](https://www.ncsl.org/research/labor-and-employment/at-will-employment-overview.aspx#:~:text=At%2Dwill%20means%20that%20an,with%20no%20adverse%20legal%20consequences), meaning employees can be fired for any reason not specifically protected (such as race, religion, and now, sexual orientation, etc.) or for no reason at all.

Do such rulings historically lead to shifts in employment practices or more successful wrongful termination cases? Or is their power more symbolic, with at-will laws trumping the arguments for termination on unlawful grounds? What would precedent lead us to believe might happen here?
