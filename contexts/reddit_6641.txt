Recruiter from a large, well known company reached out to me on LinkedIn for a position. Am I foolish for even getting my hopes up?
Basically the title. The company is rated well on Glassdoor, has a reputation for being a good place to work, and is one of the major leading companies in its industry. The position would be remote, managing a small team. I've never worked anywhere close to big like this, my current job is the largest company I've ever worked for with about 150 employees. Part of me is super flattered and excited that the recruiter reached out and wants to interview me, the other part of me is thinking who am I kidding? There's no way.

I'm currently employed and happy with where I work, but working at this new place would be such a huge opportunity, not sure if it's even worth daring to hope or if it's just recruiters probably having to meet some sort of quota and that I never really had a shot all along
