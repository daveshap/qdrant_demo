My mom asked me if I have a life
I spend most of my day at the computer, playing/Reddit/watching movies. I have friends, but almost all of them do the same thing. I've told her that since we live in a VERY small town, there isn't much we can do during the day besides gaming. 

We usually play football in the summer and explore the woods with our snowmobiles in the winter, but we got snow a few weeks ago, but there's not enough for us to go snowmobiling.

I've asked people for tips, and they've said that we could go to the movies (can't afford it more than once a month), driving around town with our cars (no one has a car) or go out drinking (which we do, but only on weekends).

What do I say to her? Do you have any tips on what to do?
