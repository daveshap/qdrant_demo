CARAVAGGIO: They're fresh. I haven't eaten an egg in…have you noticed there are chickens? You get chickens in Italy but no eggs. In Africa there were always eggs, but never chickens. Who separates them?
HANA: You were in Africa?
CARAVAGGIO: Yeah, for a while.
HANA: So was my Patient.
CARAVAGGIO: I'd like to stay. That's the long and short of it. I mean, you know blah-blah if it's convenient, if there's room blah-blah-blah. I have to do some work here -I speak the language. There are Partisans to be - -we embrace them and see if we can relieve them of their weapons, you know - while we hug. I was a thief, so they think I'd be good at that.
HANA: So you can shoot a pistol?
CARAVAGGIO: No.
HANA: If you said yes I would have had a reason. You should let me redress those bandages. Before you go.
CARAVAGGIO: I'm okay. Look, it's a big house. We needn't disturb each other. I can shoot a pistol! I'll sleep in the stables. I don't care where I sleep. I don't sleep.
HANA: Because we're fine here. I don't know what Mary told you about me, but I don't need company, I don't need to be looked at.
CARAVAGGIO: Fine. I'm not looking.
HANA: There's a man downstairs. He brought us eggs. He might stay.
THE PATIENT: Why? Can he lay eggs?
HANA: He's Canadian.
THE PATIENT: Why are people always so happy when they collide with someone from the same place? What happened in Montreal when you passed a man in the street - did you invite him to live with you?
HANA: He needn't disturb you.
THE PATIENT: Me? He can't. I'm already disturbed.
HANA: He won't disturb us then. I think he's after morphine. There's a war. Where you come from becomes important. And besides - we're vulnerable here. I keep hearing noises in the night. Voices.
ALMÁSY: How much did you pay?
KATHARINE: Hello! Good morning.
ALMÁSY: They don't see foreign women in this market. How much did you pay?
KATHARINE: Seven pounds, eight, I suppose. Why?
ALMÁSY: Which stall?
KATHARINE: Excuse me?
ALMÁSY: You've been cheated, don't worry, we'll take it back.
KATHARINE: I don't want to go back.
ALMÁSY: This is not worth eight pounds, Mrs. Clifton.
KATHARINE: I don't care to bargain.
ALMÁSY: That insults them.
KATHARINE: I don't believe that. I think you are insulted by me, somehow. You're a foreigner too, aren't you, here, in this market?
ALMÁSY: I should be very happy to obtain the correct price for this. I apologize if I appear abrupt. I am rusty at social graces. How do you find Cairo? Did you visit the Pyramids?
KATHARINE: Excuse me.
