ROCCO: Vincenzo, that fat motherfucker, Yakavetta's right hand. He's the one who set me up. Then he went around shooting his mouth off, telling everyone I was as good as dead. He goes in there every Wednesday night around 10:00, he jerks off in the same booth to the same titty dancer. Never misses.
MURPHY: So?
ROCCO: So let's kill the motherfucker. I mean, what are you guys... like that's your new thing right?
CONNOR: Yeah, well...
ROCCO: Oh, what the fuck? How do you guys decide who you're... I mean, who makes the cut? Is there a raffle or something?
MURPHY: Well, truth be known, those first ones just kinda fell into our laps.
ROCCO: Well, what'ya do?
CONNOR: I guess we really don't have a system of deciding who.
ROCCO: MEEE! ME! I'm the guy! I know everyone, their habits, where they hang out, who they talk to. I know where they fuckin' live. We could kill everyone!
MURPHY: So what do you think?
CONNOR: I'm strangely comfortable with it.
