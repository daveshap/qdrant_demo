How to execute a program when a specific string is entered in a specific window? I want to write a shell script to automate screenshots using the screenshot program Shutter when some key words are written in a certain app,such as a internet chat room or text messenger service or things like that.Essentially, when a specific string is input, such as \" its a beautiful day \I want to be able for my shell script to screenshot that specific phrase ( and not just the whole screen in general ) and then paste the screenshot to a folder.How would I go about writing this script, automating it, and using Shutter in my script?
