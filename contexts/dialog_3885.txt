COTTER: Okay, a blur.
DOMINI: Can you zoom it or something, make it real close, real big?
COTTER: I'm the ebay Boy, remember? I can't exactly afford that kind of equipment.
DOMINI: Who do you know who can? Where do we go?
HEATHER: For a blur?
DOMINI: There is something <u>there</u>--don't ask, just trust me.
COTTER: Can't you like just divine it?
DOMINI: If I could do that, I'd be at the goddamn racetrack, not here.
COTTER: I got a friend at a Lab. I could get the whole thing blown-up, enhanced--
DOMINI: --go!
COTTER: Four in the morning?
HEATHER: Cotter'll kill you.
DOMINI: He'll never know.
HEATHER: Two-to-one he dusts the keyboard for fingerprints the second he gets back.
HEATHER: At least go drink it somewhere spilling it won't drive him to suicide.
DOMINI: Okay.
HEATHER: What is it you thought you saw on that tape?
DOMINI: Still working on it.
HEATHER: Elly Kedward?
DOMINI: No. Elly Kedward's not the problem here, I don't think. She was just a good old-fashioned white witch--
SID: You're gonna owe me the rest of your life, bud.
COTTER: I know, I know.
SID: Beta Cam's still coming back tomorrow, right?
COTTER: Absolutely.
SID: <u>Before</u> 5:00--
COTTER: --hours before--
SID: --Christ, they find out I let you have it for the weekend--
COTTER: --no one'll ever know.
SID: <u>This</u> is what you wanted enhanced?
COTTER: Yeah.
SID: You mind me asking: why the fuck?
COTTER: The, uh, blur there.
SID: Looks like a rope.
