What are well-paying jobs where you can "Shut off" when you come home?
I currently work at a digital marketing agency. I am 24 years old and make 52K a year. I hate my job. The hours are long and the pay is not good for the amount of stress this job causes me. I handle a book with 12 clients. I get emails all hours of the night. I have deadlines to hit every day. It is taking its toll on me physically and mentally. It is midnight and I am still working. I am also going to school for a masters in UX design. I started school before I got this job. My undergrad is a bad liberal arts degree so I really struggled to find consistent work out of school. I don't have many options. My masters degree will put me 16K in debt which is not terrible. I will likely look for a job in UX after this but I really don't think I will be happy doing that either. I want a job that I can shut my brain off with once I go home. I was looking at pharmacy school. I am still fairly young. I figured it makes good money and is often solitary. I've heard it provides a good work-life balance as well. I don't mind going back to school again but I am really looking for a job that pays well and doesn't require a lot of human interaction.
