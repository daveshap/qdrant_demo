Depressed girlfriend of 3 years cheated on me. Feeling alone, betrayed, and inadequate
My past has been has basically been myself being alone most of the time. Weird kid in school and nobody a girl would want to be with. Until she came along.

We were happy. She has had a tough past as well. Much worse than mine. Up to the point where she cuts and was suicidal for a short period of time. She told me I made her happy and she always wrote me letters saying how much I meant to her.

I always made mistakes like forgetting to ask her if she wanted breakfast out when she came over in the morning or forgetting to tell her I was hanging out with some female friends. Things like that ate away at her and she cheated on me. She regrets she did it and is trying her best to fix herself now.

But now I feel betrayed. I feel like I can't trust anyone again. Someone who said so many kind things to me, who made me feel like I mattered. 

I'm scared because I'm alone again for the first time in 3 years and a few months. I've never done well when I was alone.

And I felt like a lot of it was my fault. I was too tired from work to come over sometimes even when she was feeling alone. I didn't treat her like my priority though I loved her more than anything. 

I need any kind of help please. Anything.
