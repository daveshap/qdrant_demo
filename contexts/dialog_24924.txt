BARNES: See this? Coral. Geologists measured the coral growth on top of the craft to be over five meters thick.
NORMAN: Geologists?
BARNES: Coral grows at a rate of two and a half centimeters a year --
NORMAN: -- Wait a second --
BARNES: -- dating the crash at least that old.
NORMAN: Hold on --
BARNES: Maybe older --
NORMAN: -- there's got to be some mistake here -- a four hundred year old military spacecraft? There's no such thing... our space program isn't even forty years old.
BARNES: Extraordinary, isn't it?
NORMAN: It's impossible.
BARNES: I'm afraid it is Dr. Johnson... because it's sitting on the bottom of our ocean floor.
BARNES: Off the record, I don't mind telling you, this thing scares the shit out of me.
NORMAN: It doesn't make any sense.
BARNES: We think it might. That's why we brought you here. We've assembled your team -- they're waiting for us now.
NORMAN: What team?
BARNES: The one you recommended. In the ULF report you wrote for the Bush administration.
NORMAN: ULF report? Nobody's mentioned that in years. You mean someone actually read it?
BARNES: Your report's become our bible down here, Dr. Johnson. We've been carrying out each of your recommendations -- one by one -- to the smallest detail.
NORMAN: But sir, I don't understand. This report -- these recommendations... they're for an encounter with extra- terrestrial life.
BETH: How big is this spacecraft?
BARNES: Of what we're able to measure, roughly twenty-six hundred feet.
TED: A half a mile long?
BARNES: The wing dimension alone is larger that any aircraft we've seen.
HARRY: How much damage?
BARNES: To the craft? None. Not a scratch.
HARRY: Right. So you're saying it survived a high speed impact with water without a scratch?
BARNES: I'm not saying anything, Harry, I'm just stating the facts. The outer metal is made of a titanium alloy, built into an epoxy- resin honeycomb. The necessary technology to bond this type of metal has never been invented.
