Ubuntu gets stuck in loading screen Whenever I try to boot Ubuntu I get a firmare bug that says the ACPI region does not cover the entire command / response buffer. Thats followed by soft system lockup for 22 seconds on cpu 2 followed by a hard lock up on cpu 1. When I run the system compatibility diagnostic thing it says I have a firmware error and need to update my e microcode to 0xb2 or later. What does this mean and how would I fix this? I'm assuming it's related to not being able to boot.
