CARCANOGUES: ...she can go up there.
ED: Well, look, I don't claim to be an expert--
CARCANOGUES: Then you listen to me, for I am expert. That girl, she give me a headache. She cannot play. Nice girl. Very clever hands. Nice girl. Someday, I think, maybe, she make a very good typist.
BIRDY: ...I stank, didn't I?
ED: He didn't say that.
BIRDY: But more or less.
ED: Look, I'm no expert, but--
BIRDY: It doesn't matter, Mr Crane.
ED: I'm sure there's a dozen teachers better than this clown. More qualified. Goddamn phony.
BIRDY: But it doesn't matter. Really, I'm not interested in playing music professionally.
BIRDY: ...I'm not certain I'll have a career at all, and if I do, I'll probably be a veterinarian.
ED: ...Uh-huh.
BIRDY: I do appreciate the interest you've taken, though.
ED: Ah... it's nothing.
BIRDY: I'm only sorry that I didn't play better for you. I know it would've made you happy. You know what you are?
ED: Huh.
BIRDY: You're an enthusiast.
ED: Huh. Yeah. Maybe...
ED: ...I guess I've been all wet.
BIRDY: But I do appreciate it, Mr Crane...
BIRDY: ...I wanted to make you happy.
ED: Birdy--
BIRDY: It's OK...
