KILGORE: Where've you been riding, Lance?
LANCE: I haven't surfed since I got here.
KILGORE: That's terrible -- we'll change that -- I'd like to see you work -- I've always liked your cutback; got a hell of a left turn, too.
KILGORE: Why the hell you wanna go up to Nu Mung Ba for?
WILLARD: I got bored in Saigon.
KILGORE: What's the furthest you been in?
WILLARD: Haiphong.
KILGORE: Haiphong? Shit, you jump in ?
WILLARD: No. Walked.
KILGORE: What'd you do for supplies?
WILLARD: Mercenaries -- agents, traitors -- they put out caches.
KILGORE: Can you trust them?
WILLARD: No. They put out two or three for every one I needed. When you get to the one you'll use, you just stake it out. If something feels wrong, you just pass it up. On one mission, I had to pass up three and ended up living on rats and chocolate bars.
KILGORE: Nu Mung Ba. Last I heard, Walter Kurtz commanded a Green Beret detachment at Nu Mung Ba.
WILLARD: When did you hear?
KILGORE: 'Bout a year ago? Is Kurtz still alive?
WILLARD: Who knows.
KILGORE: Seems to me he got himself fragged. i heard some grunt rolled a grenade in his tent. Maybe a rumor. Helluva man -- remarkable officer. Walter Kurtz woulda been a General some day. General of the Army. Shit, Head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Did you knew Kurtz?
WILLARD: I met him.
KILGORE: Don't you agree?
WILLARD: He musta changed ! I got to get into the Nung River, here or here.
KILGORE: That village you're pointing at is kinda hairy.
WILLARD: Hairy ?
KILGORE: I mean it's hairy -- they got some pretty heavy ordnance, boy -- I've lost a few recon ships in there now and again.
WILLARD: So? I heard you had a good bunch of killers here.
KILGORE: And I don't intend to get some of them chewed up just to get your tub put in the mouth of the goddman Nung River. You say you don't know Kurtz?
WILLARD: I met him.
KILGORE: You talk like him. I don't mind taking casualties, Captain, but I like to keep my ratio ten to one in this unit -- ten Cong to one.
WILLARD: You'll find enough Cong up there.
KILGORE: What about this point here?
