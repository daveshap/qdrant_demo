Salary said in interview below company range
Hi,

So I had an interview and when the recruiter asked for salary I said +- 55K, she said that currently the job has set 60K to 70K but that she will put me for 60K.  Is there a way I can increase my salary now that I know the range is higher than what I set?  i feel like I stuck myself in the lower end now, sigh.

Thanks in advance!
