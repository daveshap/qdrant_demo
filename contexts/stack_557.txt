Can't install Xampp nor Lamp I'm a newbbie on Ubuntu, and I'm having a lot of trouble trying to get Xampp or Lamp to work.So I started trying to get Xampp, and I downloaded version 7.1.10, and I did everything I'm supposed to do: -ran chmod +x on the .run file, then I ran the file. The thing is, it installed in terminal(no interface opened like I saw in many videos), still, the installation ran smoothly. In the end, it said the setup completed sucessfully, and I went looking for the app everywhere but to no avail. I searched online but couldn't find anything that solved the problem.So I uninstalled and installed several times, never worked.Then I turned to Lamp. Again, setup the same way, thru terminal, in the end it even asked if I wanted to launch bitnami lamp stack, but then nothing happened. Again, no app, nothing.So, any help would be greatly apreciated!(I'm running Ubuntu 17.10, maybe that's the problem somehow?)
