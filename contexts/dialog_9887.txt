YOUNG MAN: I'm really sad it's closing. Now what am I gonna do on Tuesday nights?
FRANCES: You can always come see it in London.
YOUNG MAN: Only if you were in it. Are you?
FRANCES: I wouldn't miss it.
YOUNG MAN: Boy, I'd love to... but I'm going to Hollywood.
FRANCES: Are you an actor?
YOUNG MAN: Hell yes!... well, okay, I'm still in school. But as soon as I graduate... California, here I come!
FRANCES: Are you really serious? About acting?
YOUNG MAN: Why... yes.
FRANCES: Then don't go to Hollywood.
YOUNG MAN: Why?
FRANCES: I'm telling you straight, if you have any serious ambitions, stay clear of the place. It'll crush you.
YOUNG MAN: You sound as if you hate it.
FRANCES: No, I don't hate it.
YOUNG MAN: Aren't you ever going back?
FRANCES: ...Not if I can help it.
YOUNG MAN: Gosh! You'll break a lot of hearts.
FRANCES: They'll mend.
YOUNG MAN: What about your husband?
FRANCES: What?
YOUNG MAN: Will you be getting back together? When you quit Hollywood, I mean.
FRANCES: What is this?
YOUNG MAN: Is it true you're getting a divorce? Comrade?
FRANCES: Why, you... you little bastard!
