QGIS 3 - Shortest path layer to layer, not point! I'm trying to build a model that will calculate the shortest path from several origins to one destination.So I have 3 georeferenced vector layers:A line road networkA point layer containing terminalsA point layer containing a single point representing a millMy model does a few things to achieve these layers, but I think that is irrelevant for this question. Now I want to calculate the shortest path from each of the terminals to the mill. If I run the tool outside of the processing modeller its easy peasy, just choosing from the terminal layer to a point I click with the mouse on the map using the tool \"Shortests Path (layer to point)\". The thing is I want to automate this and in the model tool there is a box for coordinates instead of the mouse clicking part. I want QGIS to read the coordinates from the mill point in the vector layer and insert these in the coordinate box.
