Mueller has just submitted his report to the U.S. Attorney General: Questions on what the public can see and potential loose ends.
Breaking news indicates that William Bar [has received a "comprehensive" report from Mueller](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/22/us/politics/mueller-report.html) after the House voted unanimously on a [non-binding resolution](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/14/us/politics/trump-congress-rebuke.html?module=inline) to make the findings public. 

Rod Rosenstein [has previous said: ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/as-debate-over-releasing-mueller-report-rages-rosenstein-says-justice-dept-should-not-release-info-on-uncharged-suspects/2019/02/25/74fcf5e6-392e-11e9-a06c-3ec8ed509d15_story.html?utm_term=.3728d36c7f2d)

*'The guidance I always gave my prosecutors and the agents that I worked with during my tenure on the front lines of law enforcement were if we aren’t prepared to prove our case beyond a reasonable doubt in court, then we have no business making allegations against American citizens... [Yet there] may be legitimate reasons for making exceptions."*

So...

- What are the established procedures for what happens next ?

- Who has authority to limit information/make redactions. Can the president?

- What can previous investigations tell is about how this report will play out?

- is Rosenstein's advice codified somewhere in official policy?

- Does this mean [Bijan Kian](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/mike-flynn-business-partner-bijan-kian-now-subject-mueller-probe-n823366) won't be indicted by the special counsel's office or  that the Special Prosecutors office won't indicte anyone else?

- What about the [mystery company](https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/21/politics/supreme-court-mystery-grand-jury-subpoena-mueller/index.html) that may appeal to the supreme court?

- Is this actually the end of the Mueller Investigation or will the office continue to operate to some degree beyond wrapping up trials?

- What procedure or precedent can compel that the report be made ["sight unseen"](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sight%20unseen) to promote transparency and bipartisanship in the publication of information?
