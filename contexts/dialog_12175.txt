JAKE: Hello?
MAST: Mr. Van Dorn?
JAKE: Mast?
MAST: Yeah.
JAKE: Where are you? The connection sounds very good.
MAST: I'm back in Grand Rapids.
JAKE: In G.R.? Why?
MAST: Can you meet me in about an hour? At the Pantlind Hotel?
JAKE: I've got a meeting...
MAST: What are you paying me for?
JAKE: I'll be there.
MAST: This used to be a real city. I was here about fifteen years ago. Embezzlement case. It was always a little religious for my taste, but at least it was a city. With a downtown and all.
JAKE: What have you found out?
MAST: I've got some news. Your daughter's all right. At least I think she is.
JAKE: Where is she?
MAST: I don't know.
JAKE: What do you mean?
MAST: Have you ever seen any, ah, pornographic movies, Jake?
JAKE: No.
MAST: Do you know what a hardcore" movie is?"
JAKE: That's like a stag film.
MAST: Yeah. You ever seen any of those?
JAKE: No.
MAST: They're legal now.
JAKE: They are?
MAST: Yeah. All over. Even here in Grand Rapids.
JAKE: Hmm.
MAST: There's a little stall theatre up here. It's closed now, but I'm borrowing it for an hour. I think there's something you'd better see.
