I fucked up and majored in something useless, how can I get a well paying job (60k +)?

I was a dumbass and majored in chemistry. I was a first gen college student and didn't do my research. Its a useless major unless you get more schooling and I don't want to go to med school/PA school/nursing school.

Keeping that in mind, what jobs/industries can I break into and make a decent wage that will be OK(or even happy) with the fact that I have a degree?

I just don't know what to do...
