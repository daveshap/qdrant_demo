PENGUIN: You're coming with me, you Great White Dope! To die, way down in the sewer!
MAX: Not Chip! Please! Penguin ... If you have one iota of human feeling, you'll take me instead.
PENGUIN: I don't. So, no.
MAX: I'm the one you want! Penguin, please! Ask yourself: Isn't it Max Shreck who manipulated and betrayed you? Isn't it Max, not Chip, whom you want to see immersed up to his eyeballs in raw sewage?
PENGUIN: Okay, you have a point. Plus, the hysterics are getting on my nerves.
