I’m so effing tired of jobs expecting you to stay late and work off the clock unpaid, then getting upset when you walk in a few minutes late.
Dear boss,

You made it very clear during training that “while it is not required of you to stay late, people who do this job well are going to take that extra time at the end of the day to make sure that they have everything done. They will also answer emails from work and make sure last minute things are done. They will also answer texts and take calls from the people we work with if necessary.” That’s fine. I’ve been doing that. I did all of that, made sure to reply to people when needed, stayed an extra half hour every day, even drove to a different office an hour away even though I wasn’t being paid drive time. I’ve never taken my state mandated 15 minute break. On Monday, you looked at the clock and saw that it was 15 minutes past my scheduled shift and you started asking me questions about reports and I stood there for a few extra minutes telling you what was going on. That was already after you made me come in a half hour early without asking if that was okay. We already work 9 hour days 4 days a week there is no cushion room to stay late.

I’m sorry that I walked in 5 minutes late today because I’m exhausted from working here. I get that that’s still an issue and my fault, and I can accept that. I’ll be sure not to do it again, but I also will be walking out of here at exactly when my shift is over, whether or not things are done.

Thank you

Ps- we have an all-staff meeting at 9:00 and your entire staff just walked out at 8:30 because they’re serving breakfast. I’ll be there at 8:55.

Pps- since people are still reading this, without too many details, my job is to help people get jobs. If someone came up to me with these issues, we would literally three way the department of labor.
