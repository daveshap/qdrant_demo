Sorry for the cluster!
Im trash at flirting. Its uncomfortable for me to flirt because of my past (which is another topic). So when I like a girl a just tell them I like them (sometimes). I admit I don't have friends more of associates. I'm 17 and never had a girlfriend and don't really care for sex that much. Like I'm a virgin so I don't really care for something I haven't have before you know (or maybe im just scared to fuck idk it could be either one). With that being said I do like this girl. She's dope and I want her to my girlfriend. I told my cousins about this and they said "If I don't want to fuck her or flirt with her what's the point of dating? Why won't I her just make her a close friend." It got me to think and now I feel like I want her because I see her as and this my be weird but as a "best friend that's also wifey material" like I can see myself and her have a family together. Now thinking about this Reddit pr the internet in general is probably the worst place to become vulnerable but whatever. I wrote this poem for her but I didn't give to her because she wasn't there for Valentine's Day and I heard the day after is "Sidechick Day" and of course I didn't want her to think she's a side chick. I guess someone saw my drawing though and decided to tell her because she's acting different. I also don't know if she's single or not! My questions are What should I do? What do you think happen? And How do you think I should play this out if I'm going to get a chance to date her?
(They're more like I ask to take her to prom if she's single around the time of prom and she said yes! But like I said before Idk if she's single or not)
(I also want to apologize for this cluster of words my ADD, disorganization, and currently listen to 2009 Drake got me thinking different things all at once)
