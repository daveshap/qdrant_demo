Now when we can measure gravitational field, how does the principle of equivalence hold true? LIGO measured gravitational field waves.The whole thought experiment of Einstein, leading to \u2018principle of equivalence\u2019, assumes that there is no way to know inside the rocket that whether its accelerating or things are acting under gravitational field.Now, how does this still hold true?
