GRAY: No digging Joseph. The churchyards are too well guarded. We will Burke" them
JOSEPH: Burke them?
GRAY: You are lately come to Scotland, Joseph?
JOSEPH: I come from Lisbon.
GRAY: But still you may have heard the peddlers of verse cry out their names on the streets.
GRAY: The ruffian dogs
JOSEPH: I never heard that song. But what did they do?
GRAY: Eighteen persons they killed and sold the bodies to Dr. Knox at ten pounds for a large and eight pounds for a small. That's good business, Joseph.
JOSEPH: But where did they get those people?
GRAY: That was Hare's end. Ah, you should have seen him on the streets, when he saw some old beldam deep in drink how he cozened her!
GRAY: A good-day to you Madame Tosspot
JOSEPH: We could do that. But when he had them there, then what?
GRAY: Nor did they handle axe or knife To take away their victim's life -- No sooner done than in a chest They crammed their lately welcome guest.""
JOSEPH: I don't understand the song. Tell me plain how they did it.
GRAY: I'll show you how it was done, Joseph. -- I'll show you how they Burked" them."
