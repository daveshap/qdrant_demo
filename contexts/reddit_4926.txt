I wake up hating myself
Every day is a fight for me [25m] to push suicidal thought and I don’t want to act on any of it .Im used to it at this point really.I try and be productive and normal I try and  help others,start projects ,go to work but I’m always in this deep pain where I can’t bare to even think I’m a good or worthy person. Of course I masks every thing with jokes and a fake smile but It doesn’t help. I don’t know what can make me happy make me little comfortable . This subreddit help me out a lot and there are time that I really just wanted to die but you guys helped out a lot .I just never know what to do anymore.death is not an answer but I just don’t like being alive and it’s scary.
