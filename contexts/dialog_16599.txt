MAYA: Good seeing you again.
TOWNSEND: Whish the circumstances were different.
LAREAUX: Your court order, Dr. Allen.
DR. ALLEN: You know I'm not comfortable with this.
LAREAUX: But your patient is legally entitled to it.
DR. ALLEN: This patient has been plagued with temporal lobe seizures.
LAREAUX: It's the patient's request, doctor.
DR. ALLEN: I'm aware of that, but I don't think he's in any condition to make requests. I'm trying to appeal to your more...logical self, Father. I'm concerned about harm to my patient.
LAREAUX: Father Jeremy and Deacon John Townsend of St. Ursula's, and our associate, Maya Larkin. Secular assistants are permitted if regarded as qualified. Maya is eminently qualified.
DR. ALLEN: I think I should join you.
MAYA: -- you wouldn't last five minutes.
LAREAUX: Just open the door, please.
