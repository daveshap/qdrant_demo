What are some careers/jobs that are not 9-5?
I've always been the creative type and always loved working with my hands.   At the moment I work at a doctor's office as an administrative assistant and as happy as I am to have a job, it just doesn't feel like something I want to do for the rest of my life.  

So, people of reddit who do not have the standard 9-5, what do ya do?
