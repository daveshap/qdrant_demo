PRICE: Jesus!
EVELYN: Question answered.
PRICE: They weren't loaded when I put them in there!
EVELYN: Funky little house, ain't it? Friends, your hostess is now going to retire for what's left of the night. If you need me, I'll be in the bedroom upstairs -- but try and fight that need: the door'll be locked, I'll be trying to sleep, and if anyone so much as breathes in the keyhole, I'm gonna empty this thing into their fucking head. Thank you all for the bestest birthday a girl could have.
PRICE: Even if I were inclined, I've had better -- and a lot safer -- opportunities to kill off a wife.
BLACKBURN: Three times, to be exact.
PRICE: Excuse me?
BLACKBURN: Accidents. Fatal. Each of your prior wives, so we've been informed.
PRICE: Can't imagine by who. I don't suppose the truth would interest you: that I've never had another wife but Evelyn.
PRICE: Married. Once. Same woman. All these years. She just slithered up the stairs.
EDDIE: Prove it.
PRICE: Prove it how?
