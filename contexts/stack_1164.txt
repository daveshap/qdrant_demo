Forcing a LIMIT to MySQL Queries using ProxySQL, QueryRewrite, or some other method I have a system that end users will need to query but they are not guaranteed to be well versed in query writing.  We wanted to ensure every SELECT statement ends with a LIMIT 100000.  I have thought of some regex to do this and some tools.  It seems the native Query Rewrite is a good option but we needed to use ProxySQL for other things, thus I wanted to see if anyone knows of a way to force this.It seems like the patter or regex would be something like:anything that starts with select needs to have a LIMIT on the final line followed by a space and int equal to or less than 100000 then maybe a semi colon.Has anyone had any luck doing this?
