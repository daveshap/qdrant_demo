JANINE: Can I call you at the office?
TUDOR: What do you want to call me at the office for?
JANINE: I don't know. I just thought I might want to call you. I don't know.
TUDOR: I won't be at the office except to sign in. I've got a lot of claims to check out. All over the place. Garages and more garages. I'll come home right after work.
