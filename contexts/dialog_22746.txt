WALTER: Miss Scarlett. In the broom closet. With the radio.
ANNIE: I gotta go. I'll see you at work. Walter, you scared me. Don't ever do that again.
SAM: Don't ever do that again.
JONAH: I thought I saw a black widow spider.
SAM: What are you doing up?
JONAH: I was thirsty.
SAM: There's a bathroom upstairs.
JONAH: The water tastes better in the kitchen.
SAM: That's true. Why is that?
ANNIE: Becky heard this woman on the radio complaining about this guy she was sure was Rick, which meant he was cheating on her. She was completely hysterical. Then it turned out the woman lived in Duluth.
WALTER: That doesn't make any sense.
ANNIE: I know. It makes no sense at all. Thank God my life is in place.
JESSICA: Write her.
JONAH: You think so?
JESSICA: It's Y. O. H.
JONAH: Yeah. What's that?
JESSICA: Your only hope.
ANNIE: I thought I would look into doing a story about those radio shows.
BECKY: You'd probably have to go somewhere to really look into it.
ANNIE: Definitely.
