I am so proud of my wife
My wife has extreme anxiety and when she does something that upsets me, that triggers it. It is super hard for me because I can never express myself in our relationship. 

Well tonight I was having a really hard day. I expressed it to her and she ignored me. She didn’t pick up on how hard my day was even though I expressed it very clearly. Later she could tell that I was even more sad and knew it had something to do with her. I didn’t want to go into detail because it would of set off a panic attack and I wouldn’t of been able to handle both my shit and her panic attack. I needed to take care of me tonight. 

So I tried to be as involved in our night as possible but let her lead and suggest what we did tonight. Obviously she could tell that my night was off and she started to become very distant. I got more upset at this because I wanted to be comforted. 

After a couple of hours she came out and said “ I know you need me tonight but I don’t know if I am strong enough.” She was talking behind a door and refused to come out. “But I just want to let you know that I love you and one day I will be able to comfort you.” 

After we kept talking she finally came out and I was able to open up and get the care and love that I needed. 

She didn’t have a panic attack. She did cry and almost went into it a couple of times but she was able to stay present and be what I needed in a partner tonight. 

We have been working on this for two and a half years and tonight was a major breakthrough. I am so proud of how far she has come.
