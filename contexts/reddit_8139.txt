Dozens of House Republicans occupy the SCIF to stall the closed-door testimony of Laura Cooper. What are the laws regarding closed-door sessions and the usage of the SCIF, and can any sort of legal action be levied against these Republican lawmakers for such an action?
This morning, Laura Cooper was scheduled to testify in the ongoing impeachment inquiry regarding President Trump and aid to Ukraine. As Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense, she called in to speak about the mechanisms behind Ukranian aid and also the fallout from the White House's suspension of said aid over the summer. However, shortly before her testimony could begin, members of the House Freedom Caucus, led by Republican Matt Gaetz of the Flordia 1st, held a short press conference in the "basement of the Captial" in which they laid out complaints about the secrecy of the testimony and of the impeachment inquiry itself.

After this short conference, Gaetz and what was reported to be around 30 House Republicans entered the House Intelligence Committee's Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility, or SCIF, while outside members of the press heard the chanting of "Let us in." It has also been reported that Schiff has made contact with both the Sergeant of Arms and Capitol Police who are attempting to end the standoff.

\-------------------

My question revolves around the nature of these closed-door hearings and the SCIF itself. What are the actual rules surrounding how it can be used and who can enter the room? What are the house rules on closed-door hearings and who can enter those? Many Republicans seem to be basing criticism on the rules and how unfair they are to the American voter whose representative can't get information about these hearings and testimonials, so how were these rules decided on if there is such a huge issue around representatives not having access to information? Finally, were any actual laws broken or is this an issue of ceremony where we might see censure, but no actual charges?
