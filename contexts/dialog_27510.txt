DANNY: Read the early Zionists on European Jewry; they sound like Goebbels.
AVI: They sound like you.
DANNY: The Nazis did everything the f√ºhrer told them. You do everything the Torah tells you. Or the rebbe. Identical slave mentality.
MIRIAM: Why did you come tonight? To see me?
DANNY: To hear them read Torah.
MIRIAM: I thought you hated Torah.
DANNY: That doesn't mean I don't like hearing it.
MIRIAM: Point out all the lies and fucked-up thinking.
MIRIAM: You know the joke: a Jew's shipwrecked on a desert island. When they rescue him, they see he's built two synagogues. They say, for vhat do you need two synagogues? He says, vun to pray in, and vun I'd never set foot in so long as I live, so help me God. You pray in the one you'd never set foot in...and vice versa.
DANNY: I can't help what I think.
MIRIAM: This is me.
MIRIAM: Tell me about Lina Moebius.
DANNY: How did you...?
MIRIAM: I work in the DA's office. You go to those meetings, half the people there are informants.
DANNY: You mean the <i>Times</i> guy?
MIRIAM: Which <i>Times</i> guy?
DANNY: With the shoes... There was more than one?
