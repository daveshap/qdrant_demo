Free or reduced cost of college has been a major theme this election season, which some claim would actually devalue existing degrees. Is there any evidence for this view? And are the other benefits worth it?
A common criticism of expanded access to higher education, whether through government-funded college or other means, is that [a greater number of degrees may devalue existing degrees](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/patricia-mcguire/free-community-college-gi_b_6451562.html), hurting those already with higher education while reducing the benefits for the newly educated. 

There are a number of issues to consider here. First of all, **is there any evidence that expanding the number of graduates actually depresses wages?** While intuition suggests that rising supply would lower prices (i.e. wages), it has been [pointed out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lump_of_labour_fallacy) that labor is far from being a homogenous good, and so the classic logic of supply and demand applies more weakly to it. Additionally, there is [some evidence](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S157400800480018X) that a higher density of the highly educated leads to greater knowledge spillover between firms and industries, boosting productivity (and hopefully wages).

Secondly, **do the peripheral benefits of higher education outweigh the costs of lower wages?** The rhetoric around higher education frequently references the need to focus on high-earning majors such as STEM, leading to policy changes such as the [cutting of social science and humanities funding in Japan](http://time.com/4035819/japan-university-liberal-arts-humanities-social-sciences-cuts/). However, [there is evidence](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=fcXb_1i4XmwC&oi=fnd&pg=PR7&dq=benefits+of+higher+education&ots=rvsTqGl8n1&sig=0jeRas02ZzpI60pbNxh9kpRFPGM#v=onepage&q=benefits%20of%20higher%20education&f=false) that higher education, regardless of major, has major benefits to society such as greater political involvement and awareness, healthier life habits and reduced levels of crime.
