Can I travel to New Zealand with an expired H4 visa? I am planning to go to New Zealand with my husband. I have an H4 (dependent visa) which is up for renewal. I am planning to go to New Zealand, spend 10 days and go to India, renew my visa and come back to the USA. Will there be problems while applying for a NZ visa?
