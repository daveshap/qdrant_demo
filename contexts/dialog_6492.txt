LUKE: Is that your answer, Old Man? You're a hardcase too, ain't you?
DRAGLINE: Luke, are you alright?... They got us, boy. They're out there thicker'n flies. Bosses and dogs and sheriffs and more guns than I ever seen in my life. We don't have a chance, Luke... They caught up with me right after we split up and they was aimin' to kill you, Luke. But I got 'em to promise if you give up peaceful, they wouldn't even whip you this time.
LUKE: Do we even get our same bunks back?
DRAGLINE: Why sure, Luke. I mean I didn't talk to them about that. But why not? They're reasonable, Luke. Hell, we only been gone a coupla hours.
LUKE: You don't understand a thing, do you, Drag?
DRAGLINE: Luke, you got to listen to me. All you got to do is just give up nice and quiet, just play it cool.
LUKE: Like I always do?
DRAGLINE: Thass right. Just play it...
