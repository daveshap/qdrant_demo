State is calling me in for Re-emplyment Services & Eligibility Assessment and forced to attend classes, but new job starts in 1 month. Need advice!
So, I lost my job at the end of September, and have been hunting ever since. I am on unemployment, which requires you apply for at least 2 jobs per week. Trouble is I procrastinated and applied for sometimes 4 jobs 1 week and a job the next, but I always met the grand total. I fudged the dates in my self reports. 

Now, I am being called into my local unemployment office to review my resume, record of job searches and applications. I am also being automatically enrolled in classes. If I don't attend both, I lose benefits. I am both worried and frustrated. Worried that they will check the dates I recorded with employers and I will lose benefits, frustrated because I JUST accepted a job, but it starts Dec. 1. 

Questions:
1. Is it common for this to occur after 1 month on unemployment and not working?
2. What are the chances they will verify my record with employers?
3. Has anyone been in a similar situation on fudging dates? What were your repercussions?
