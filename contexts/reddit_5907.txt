What online certification could I obtain to secure a job?
I work a dead end desk job in Ontario, Canada. I'm looking at different online courses that could land me a high demand job. I like tech and business. I was perhaps thinking of getting an AutoCad certification, coding or Data Analytics. But I don't want to commit to studying something that will not get me a better job than my current one. Thereby, resuming the dreadful job search. Do you guys have any programs or courses in mind?

TIA!
