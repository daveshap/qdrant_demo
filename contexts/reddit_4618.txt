Was already depressed, then my father died
I’ve never lost someone this close to me before. It’s hard to tell the difference between my normal depression level and what is added on to that from this loss. It wasn’t a sudden unexpected death, so maybe that made it a little easier. I cried a couple of times thinking about him, but most of the time I’m just depressed like usual. It’s been a couple of weeks now. I’m not really sure if I’ve actually mourned his death. I just feel empty inside, but that’s my normal state.
