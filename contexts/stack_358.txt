Self-Renewing 'Automation' virus redirects Safari and Chrome through ads to bing. Renews through a memory alert Running macOS 10.14.2. Safari 12.0.1.Symptoms:Safari redirects searches through proxy to bingChrome redirects searches through proxy to bingIn Privacy Settings, under Automation \"Finder\" with no icon has access to SafariWhen removing it, a preferences pop up shows up.Immediately after a memory warning shows up and cancel the preferences pop up.\"Finder\" reappears under \"Automation\" with safari checked.When quitting Safari, it launches alone. (Can't close safari)Attempts:Used \"tccutil reset AppleEvents\both pop ups appear once after execution.Used Avira anti-virus with quick scan it found and eliminated 1 virus, ran a full scan and it found and removed 4. Did not run it again.No clue how to remove this without disabling SIP which is not something I necessarily want to do, nor would I know how to exactly find \"Finder\". It also seems to be using some exploit to grant itself Automation privileges even after you uncheck them via some memory issue that triggers the memory warning. How can malware like this be cleaned?
