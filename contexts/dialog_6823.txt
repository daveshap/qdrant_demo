ERIC: Top Dollar, you're the only one here still wasting good air...
TOP DOLLAR: Five large, in the drawer right over there. I never saw you.
ERIC: Do you know what you destroyed?
TOP DOLLAR: Take the dope, too.
ERIC: A year ago. A very nice lady circulated a petition. She died. Last Halloween. Answer yes or no.
TOP DOLLAR: That's ancient history.
ERIC: It's yesterday! Do you know what you destroyed?
TOP DOLLAR: Who gives a fuck! I'm a businessman. You gonna do me, then do me and shut you're face!
ERIC: You don't even remember...
TOP DOLLAR: I never forget anything, dickhead. That building was a sweep-and- clear; the bitch was a nuisance with her goddamned petition. It got a little rowdy... end of story.
ERIC: Rowdy. Let me fill in some gaps for you.
