STACY: Thanks for picking me up.
RON: No problem.
RON: 'The Cuer-vo Gold, the fi-ine Columbian.' You look nice tonight.
STACY: Thanks. So do you.
RON: Where do you feel like going?
STACY: I don't know. Wherever you want.
RON: How about the point?
STACY: The point sounds fine.
RON: All right, the point it is.
STACY: That's a nice shirt.
RON: Thanks. Thanks a lot.
RON: It's very warm out tonight.
STACY: It is. It's very warm. I wonder how long it will last?
RON: Are you really nineteen?
STACY: Yes... I am really nineteen.
RON: I think I better take you home.
STACY: What about those other guys you live with?
RON: No. I mean back to your home.
RON: Is this your first time?
STACY: Yes.
LINDA: Was it great?
STACY: It was okay.
LINDA: You'll always remember your first time.
STACY: It was nice.
LINDA: So tell me, do you like Ron? Is it serious?
STACY: Come on, Linda. It's just sex.
LINDA: Hey! That's my line!
BRAD: Mom says to clean up the pool.
STACY: Why can't you do it?
BRAD: Your friends use the pool. Your friends messed it up.
STACY: Your friends use the pool too.
BRAD: I take out the garbage.
STACY: Don't strain yourself.
STACY: Brad! Have Mom or Dad seen this?
BRAD: They're not home yet.
STACY: Brad, what would you say if I asked you to just put these flowers in the trunk of the Cruising Vessel and get rid of them at work?
BRAD: I'd say... who the hell is Ron Johnson?
STACY: I'll explain everything later.
