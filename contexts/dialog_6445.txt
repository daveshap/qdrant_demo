ELLIE: I used... I used to dream you were alive... and then I'd wake up and lose you all over again.
TED: I'm sorry I couldn't be there for you, sweetheart.
ELLIE: Dad... But tell me, how did... I mean how can...?
ELLIE: You're not real. None of this is.
TED: That's my scientist.
ELLIE: So. Are you an hallucination? Or are little gear trains and circuit boards under your skin?
TED: Am I artifact or dream? You might ask that about anything.
ELLIE: But you're so... I mean how could you possibly...? When I was unconscious. You... downloaded... my thoughts, my memories, even... This beach. I've never been here but I remember... it's how I always imagined... Pensacola.
TED: We thought this might make things a little easier.
