My workplace is doing nothing to prevent the spread of COVID-19. What should I do?
 I work at FedEx Ground as a package handler trainer. My managers and   their hire ups have done absolutely nothing to prevent the spread of   COVID-19. We are told to wash our hands frequently. However, no one but   me and a few others does this. Its like they all just gave up. I don't   want to get the virus and I honestly don't want to go to work, at the  same time I want to stay safe. What should I do?
