JAMES: I don't think we should have come here. I'm surprised the police don't make it more difficult.
HELEN: Were you badly hurt? I think we saw each other at the hospital. I don't want the car. In fact, I was appalled to find that I have to pay a small fee to have it scrapped.
JAMES: Can I give you a lift? I somehow find myself driving again.
JAMES: You haven't told me where we're going.
HELEN: Haven't I? To the airport, if you could.
JAMES: The airport? Why? Are you leaving?
HELEN: Not yet - though not soon enough for some people, I've already found. A death in the doctor's family makes the patients doubly uneasy.
JAMES: I take it you're not wearing white to reassure them.
HELEN: I'll wear a bloody kimono if I want to.
JAMES: So - why the airport?
HELEN: I work in the immigration department there.
HELEN: Do you want a cigarette? I started to smoke at the hospital. It's rather stupid of me.
JAMES: Look at all this traffic. I'm not sure I can deal with it.
HELEN: It's much worse now. You noticed that, did you? The day I left the hospital I had the extraordinary feeling that all these cars were gathering for some special reason I didn't understand. There seemed to be ten times as much traffic.
JAMES: Are we imagining it?
