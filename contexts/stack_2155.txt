Linking two portals in Minecraft I have built a mob grinder in Minecraft, 200 blocks into the air. Obviously, in a Survival World, getting up and down the can be difficult, and ugly. I have attempted to use the \"two portals - one teleport\" idea; that is, build two Nether Portals in the same chunk, and you can use them to travel between two point is the Overworld. However, I cannot get this to work - I have had mixed results.I have tried building the two portals 150 blocks away from each other (one at y=50, the other at y=200), light one, and enter the nether, to establish the link, then light the other one. This has given me mixed results. Either:A third Nether Portal spawns in a separate location (as if the first portal was broken)I only reappear out of the first Nether Portal, regardless of where I enter.Is there a way to use two Nether Portals as a form of \"Elevator\"?
