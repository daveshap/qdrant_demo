MCMURPHY: I'm not finished yet.
BIG NURSE: Go on...
MCMURPHY: 'Kay, item two. Tomorrow, and listen carefully to me, you ding-a lings. Tomorrow is the opening game of the World Series an' what I want is to take a vote on switchin' the group meetin' to later on in the day, so we can watch the ballgame.
BIG NURSE: Just a minute, Mister McMurphy!
MCMURPHY: Yeah?
BIG NURSE: Please understand, the schedule has been set up for a delicately balanced reason that would be thrown into turmoil by a switch of routines.
MCMURPHY: The hell with the schedule, you can get back to the schedule next week when the series is over. What I want is a vote on it right now!
CHESWICK: I second the motion!
MCMURPHY: Atta boy, Cheswick!
