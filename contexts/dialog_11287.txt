KAREN'S MOTHER: He didn't call?
KAREN: He's with his friends.
KAREN'S MOTHER: What kind of person doesn't call?
KAREN: He's a grown man. Be doesn't have to call every five minutes.
KAREN'S MOTHER: If he was so grown up he'd get you two an apartment.
KAREN: Don't bring that up. You're the one who wanted us here.
KAREN'S MOTHER: Look. He's got the whole house in an uproar.
KAREN'S MOTHER: He's got your father upset. Good thing he doesn't have to go to work in the morning. Is this what he deserves?
KAREN: Ma! Please! You're driving me crazy.
KAREN'S MOTHER: Driving you crazy? Don't get me started. You're here a month and sometimes I know he doesn't come home at all. What kind of people are these?
KAREN: Ma! Stop! What do you want me to do?
KAREN'S MOTHER: Do? What can you do? What did you expect? He wasn't Jewish. Did you know bow they live? Your father would never stay out this late without calling. In thirty years he never stayed out all night.
KAREN: Stayed out? Daddy never went out at all.
