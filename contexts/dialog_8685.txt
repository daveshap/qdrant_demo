JOEL: I knew.
CLEMENTINE: I knew by your nervousness that Naomi wasn't the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass.
JOEL: It's dark.
CLEMENTINE: Yeah. What's your girlfriend's name?
JOEL: Naomi.
CLEMENTINE: Ah-ha! Now I can look for candles, matches, and the liquor cabinet.
JOEL: I think we should go.
CLEMENTINE: No, it's our house! Just tonight -- -- we're David and Ruth Laskin. Which one do you want to be? I prefer to be Ruth but I'm flexible. Alcohol! You make drinks. I'm going find the bedroom and slip into something more Ruth. I'm ruthless at the moment.
JOEL: I really should go. I really need to catch my ride.
VOICE-OVER: I didn't want to go. I was too nervous. I thought, maybe you were a nut. But you were exciting. You called from upstairs.
CLEMENTINE: So go.
JOEL: I did. I walked out the door. I felt like I was a scared little kid. I thought you knew that about me. I ran back to the bonfire, trying to outrun my humiliation. You said, so go" with such disdain."
CLEMENTINE: What if you stay this time?
JOEL: I walked out the door. There's no more memory.
CLEMENTINE: Come back and make up a good-bye at least. Let's pretend we had one.
CLEMENTINE: Bye, Joel.
JOEL: I love you.
