Suicide Hotline hung up on me
I told them everything that was happening and that I don't want to go on and they said sorry we couldnt help you and disconnected. Are you fucking KIDDING ME? Like I was placing an order at Taco Bell. I feel like they answered my problem right there. It's a good thing I don't have my pistol. Fuckin hell. How can you claim to help anyone suicidal with resources that can't help people? Now I want to run headfirst into traffic.
