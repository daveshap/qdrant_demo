JOANNE: I worked for Mr. Marsh for six years. He was a good man -- until she came along.
DULANEY: What changed?
JOANNE: He did. Look, I know you can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink -- but you hold a pail of water in front of an old horse for long enough -- and well...
DULANEY: You don't really believe what the district attorney is saying about Miss Lawson, do you?
JOANNE: I don't know. It's incredible to think that anyone could be capable of doing that -- but if anyone could it would be Rebecca.
DULANEY: I take it you don't like Miss Lawson very much?
JOANNE: I really don't know her that well. We would say hello to each other when I would come to the house, but that was about it.
DULANEY: If you don't know her that well what makes you think she's capable of murder?
JOANNE: Andrew was a kind and gentle man, but he was thirty years older than her. Where's the attraction to sleep with someone like that -- to have the kind of sex they had.
DULANEY: How do you know what kind of sex they had?
JOANNE: I wasn't lookin' through the keyhole if that's what you're thinking. I'd come to house sometimes to pick up papers or speak to Andrew. I'd find their little toys all over the place.
DULANEY: Did Mr. Marsh use drugs?
JOANNE: No.
DULANEY: What about Miss Lawson?
JOANNE: Yes -- cocaine.
DULANEY: How do you know that?
JOANNE: I was at the house one morning -- I thought Miss Lawson was upstairs with Mr. Marsh. When I went into the guest bathroom she was standing in front of the mirror pouring this white powder out of a vial.
