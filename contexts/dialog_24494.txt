KELVIN: They shouldn't let people like you into space.
SARTORIUS: Just so you know: I'm not going back until I understand what it is. I am going to figure out what it is, make it stop, and then I will go home.
KELVIN: Listen --
SARTORIUS: We're done. Oh, I should tell you, I don't trust Snow. There's something wrong with him.
KELVIN: Is there anybody else here?
SNOW: Why, who did you see?
KELVIN: Gibarian warned me. He left me a message.
SNOW: Who was it?
KELVIN: She was real. Where did she come from?
KELVIN: Tell me. I won't think you're insane.
SNOW: Oh, that's a relief.
