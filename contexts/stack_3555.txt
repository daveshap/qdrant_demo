What's the benefit of JWT if user needs to send his credentials once anyway? JWT tokens seem like a very good idea. You can send a request to some API without using your username/password secret pair.Still, I don't fully understand the benefits that it gives. I have two questions:To get the token, user still needs to send his credentials to some server that issues these tokens. Isn't it a weak point of all this?If attacker steals the token while it's being transferred, he can use it to pretend he is someone else. The only difference between this and using user/password combination is that JWT tokens get expired after some period of time, so attacker doesn't have much time to do his thing.Is my understanding correct? What am I missing? What are real advantages of using JWT vs user/password?
