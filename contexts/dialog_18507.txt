LONGFELLOW: Let him alone.
FARMER: Let me alone! If you know what's good for you - you'll let me get this off my chest! How did you feel feeding doughnuts to a horse? Get a kick out of it, huh? Got a big laugh? Did you ever think of feeding doughnuts to human beings! No!
WALTER: Shall I call the police, sir?
LONGFELLOW: No! What do you want!!
FARMER: Yeah - that's all that's worrying you. What do I want? A chance to feed a wife and kids! I'm a farmer. A job! That's what I want!
LONGFELLOW: A farmer, eh! You're a moocher, that's what you are! I wouldn't believe you or anybody else on a stack of bibles! You're a moocher like all the rest of them around here, so get out of here!
FARMER: Sure - everybody's a moocher to you. A mongrel dog eating out of a garbage pail is a moocher to you!
