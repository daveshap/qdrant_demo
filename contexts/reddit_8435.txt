What are the pros and cons of police not having a duty to protect citizens?
In 2005, [Warren vs District of Columbia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_v._District_of_Columbia) was upheld in [Town of Castle Rock v Gonzales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town_of_Castle_Rock_v._Gonzales), reaffirming that police in the US have no duty to protect citizens. The outcome upholding that their sole duty is to enforce the law on behalf of the State.

What are the pros and cons of the police lacking the legal obligation to protect citizens? How does it compare with the Duty to Rescue doctrine in other countries? Is it is line with our Constitutional Principles? Does the calculus change in jurisdictions where the head of the police are elected rather than appointed? Does a lack of dual responsibility to the State and to its Citizens result in State power centralization?
