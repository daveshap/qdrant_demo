NINOTCHKA: I must go.
LEON: Ninotchka, or shall I say Special Envoy Yakushova...
NINOTCHKA: Let's forget that we ever met.
LEON: I have a better suggestion. Let's forget that the telephone ever rang. I never heard that you are Yakushova... you are Ninotchka... my Ninotchka...
NINOTCHKA: I was sent here by my country to fight you.
LEON: All right, fight me, fight me as much as you want, but fight me tomorrow morning! There's nothing sweeter than sharing a secret with a bitter enemy.
NINOTCHKA: As a representative of Moscow...
LEON: Tonight let's not represent anybody but ourselves.
NINOTCHKA: It is out of the question. If you wish to approach me...
LEON: You know I want to...
NINOTCHKA: Then do it through my lawyer!
LEON: Ninotchka, you can't walk out like this... I'm crazy about you, and I thought I'd made an impression on you. You liked the white of my eye.
