Super Tuesday megathread
It's [Super Tuesday!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Tuesday)

This is the day in the US election season when the highest number of states have their primaries or caucuses to choose the nominees of the major parties for the November presidential election. Here are the states participating:

* Alabama
* Arkansas
* Colorado
* Georgia
* Massachusetts
* Minnesota
* Oklahoma
* Tennessee
* Texas
* Vermont
* Virginia
* Alaska (Republican only)
* Wyoming (Republican only)
* American Samoa (participating US territory)

The latest [Republican](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/march1GOP.html) and [Democratic](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/march1dem.html) poll results paint a pretty clear picture.

Here are a few starter questions:

* What are the most important aspects of Super Tuesday?
* Which of the states voting today are bellwethers for states whose primaries are still to come?
* Which, if any, races after today matter?
* Do you expect any surprises?
* Who is likely to drop out if they don't perform well today? On the other hand, who is likely to stay in the race even if they don't perform well?
* What are the pros and cons of having a bunch of primaries on a single day?

Feel free to ask other questions and post comments about the races, keeping in mind that it's essential to be polite here and that assertions of fact require sources in this subreddit.
