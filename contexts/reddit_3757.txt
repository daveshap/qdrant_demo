I was dating an Instagram normie
Things seemed fine at first, but I did notice she seemed to use an awful lot of emojis in our txt conversations.. but I was smitten and refused to see the signs.

Then one night I caught her taking selfies in bed.. and it all became clear. I checked online and sure enough, Instagram account with 2k followers. There was my bae with dog ears. I felt so played. 

It's over with her, but at least now I know the signs.
