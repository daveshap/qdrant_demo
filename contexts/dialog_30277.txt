VOICE: Mr. Galvin's...
GALVIN: Let me talk to Mickey.
MICKEY: Yeah? How's our new witness?
GALVIN: D'you find the obstetric nurse?
MICKEY: She's workin' the late shift at the Hospital. She's at home now, I'm going over there to talk to...
GALVIN: Gimme the address. I'm gonna go. We're going to need her.
GALVIN: I'm Joe Galvin, I'm representing Deborah Ann Kaye, case against St. Catherine Laboure.
MARY ROONEY: I told the guy I didn't want to talk to...
GALVIN: I'll just take a minute. Deborah Ann Kaye. You know what I'm talking about. The case is going to trial. Our chief witness is a Dr. David Gruber, you know who he is?
MARY ROONEY: No.
GALVIN: He's the Assistant Chief of Anesthesiology, Massachusetts Commonwealth. He says your doctors, Towler and Marx, put my girl in the hospital for life. And we can prove that. What we don't know is why. What went on in there? In the O.R. That's what we'd like to know. Something went wrong. And you know what it was. They gave her the wrong anesthetic. What happened? The phone rang...someone got distracted...what?
MARY ROONEY: ...you got your doctor's testimony. Why do you need me?
GALVIN: I want someone who was in the O.R. We're going to win the case, there's no question of that. It's just a matter of how big...
MARY ROONEY: I've got nothing to say to you.
GALVIN: You know what happened.
MARY ROONEY: Nothing happened.
GALVIN: Then why aren't you testifying for their side?
GALVIN: I can subpoena you, you know. I can get you up there on the stand.
MARY ROONEY: And ask me what?
GALVIN: Who put my client in the hospital for life.
MARY ROONEY: I didn't do it, Mister.
GALVIN: Who are you protecting, then?
MARY ROONEY: Who says that I'm protecting anyone?
GALVIN: I do. Who is it? The Doctors. What do you owe them?
MARY ROONEY: I don't owe them a goddamn thing.
GALVIN: Then why don't you testify?
MARY ROONEY: You know, you're pushy, fella...
GALVIN: You think I'm pushy now, wait 'til I get you on the stand...
MARY ROONEY: Well, maybe you better do that, then. You know you guys are all the same. You don't care who gets hurt. You're a bunch of whores. You'd do anything for a dollar. You got no loyalty...no nothing...you're a bunch of whores.
