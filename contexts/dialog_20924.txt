FRY: I would try for them.
RIDDICK: You barely know them.
FRY: But I'm human. I know you view that as a weakness, but I'm sorry -- I <u>do</u> feel fear, theirs too. Goddamnit, Riddick -- yes. I would die for them.
AUDREY: You came for us....
RIDDICK: Yeah, yeah -- we're all fuckin' amazed. Anyone not ready for this?
