MARY: Would you like to learn them?
STEVE: I sure would.
MARY: Maybe I could start you out.
STEVE: That'd be swell. You know, you're an awful lot different than I thought you'd be.
STEVE: You're so nice.
MARY: Did someone say I wasn't nice?
STEVE: Oh no. Nobody said nothing to me. Only I got the idea that -- well Clay and me used to be walking through town and there was your place and through the window I could see you dancing, but Clay always took me over to the other side of the street.
