Isn’t it kinda bullshit that you can’t confide in anyone that you want to kill yourself without being committed?
If you’re in such a bad place that you’re thinking of killing yourself but not at the point to where you’re in immediate danger of doing it, shouldn’t you be able to admit this, without being held against your will at a psychiatric facility that your insurance probably won’t cover, work won’t be happy about your absence at, where you’ll be given meds against your will and not allowed to leave?

What if I could admit this to a psychiatrist/therapist so that we can have a discussion about the most appropriate med + therapy combo to get me on the right track?

Because the idea of just trusting random mood stabilizing drugs being forced upon me as I’m whisked away from work and my daily life and not allowed to live my life or leave for 3 or more days *wouldn’t exactly inspire me to ask for help in the future*.

What if I could just be candid about how I feel so that I can get treated? Can’t imagine that I’m the only one who feels this way. Makes me feel horribly alone. How can I best be treated if I’m withholding this from my healthcare providers, when I’m not in immediate danger? Surely I’m not the only one who struggles, with this concept?
