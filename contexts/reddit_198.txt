Low self confidence
Well i dont know what's the reaon but i feel like i have extremly low self confidence, the kind where you don't know where to look when you'r walking so that you look normal, the kind where you feel tired all the time from social interaction. a lot of times i find myslef sitting along just cause i don't know what to do how to go and start a conversation and so on.

Even though i can say i'm quite a successful person and so do other say sometimes, i still have this low self confidence for some reason and it's realy annoying cause i feel like i'm not fulfilling myself i feel like i'm such a success but my self confidence is driveing me back.

so any advice? im pretty helpless 

(sorry for any english mistakes i'll be happy if you'll point them out so i could improve...)
