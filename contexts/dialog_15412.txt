ANDY: How is she?
FRANK: She's unconscious, but they think she's going to make it.
ANDY: You alright?
FRANK: I've seen a lot of things in my time on the job, but nothing like this. Yurilivich?
ANDY: I was with him the whole time until I got the call at the hotel.
FRANK: Sanderson?
ANDY: I spoke to Jeremy. He's watching Sanderson's kid. Sanderson went out after the match and hasn't come back since.
FRANK: Find him! I want to talk to him.
KATHY: Hi.
PETER: Can I come in?
PETER: The other night -- I said some things that maybe I shouldn't have. I mean, you haven't known me very long and I can see how you thought what you did.
KATHY: I'm not looking for an apology, Peter.
PETER: I was thinking that... maybe when this is all over we could...
KATHY: I want someone I can get close to. I don't know if that's possible with you.
PETER: You really haven't seen my best side.
KATHY: Peter...
PETER: No, listen. You have no idea of the kind of pressure I'm under right now.
KATHY: That's still no excuse. You treat everything like a game.
PETER: I can't think any more, unless it's about you. I'll be in the middle of a match and instead of thinking about my next move, I think about how you look when you smile. Remember how you said that I hide behind my chessboard? Ever since my wife died I've been... I've been afraid of getting too close to someone again -- afraid of losing them.
KATHY: You're wife died. You can't feel responsible for that.
PETER: You don't understand.
KATHY: Then help me to understand. I want to understand.
PETER: It's not that easy.
KATHY: Of course it isn't. It's always difficult when someone you love dies. But you can't feel responsible because she had a car accident.
PETER: But I do.
KATHY: Why?
PETER: Because she killed herself!!
PETER: This letter. I've never opened it.
KATHY: Why not?
PETER: Because I know what it says.
KATHY: Maybe you're afraid of what it says.
