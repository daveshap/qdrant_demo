Export CPU usage of SINGLE PROCESS in csv format I want to collect data about the CPU utilization of a SINGLE PROCESS over time. I tried to wrap the collection of data (e.g. using pidstat) in a while loopwith a one second sleep, but it does not work. I also tried using collectl but I did not manage to find an option to collect the data of a single process (I tried with --procfilter p , but the output was not reliable.Is there a standard (possible open source) tool that measures the CPU utilization of a SINGLE PROCESS (using the PID) over time and gives the possibility to dump these data in a csv file?
