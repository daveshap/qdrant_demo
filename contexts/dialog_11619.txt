ROY: You were gone for a while.
MYRA: I went out to Delmar.
ROY: ) The track? Did you run into Lilly?
MYRA: I saw her.
ROY: She didn't see you, in other words.
MYRA: I'm not trying to make trouble, Roy. It's just, she's always so nasty to me, I thought, who is she to be so high and mighty. I saw her out there, and I called a friend of mine in Baltimore, so now I know who she is.
ROY: You must have some very knowledgeable friends.
MYRA: I'm well connected, Roy, Cole introduced me to a lot of people. Very valuable. Valuable for us.
ROY: Running your broker scam, you mean.
MYRA: You and me, Roy. What a team we'll make. We think alike; we get along together. Once or twice a year we take some slob, the rest of the time we live like this. You won't regret this, Roy.
ROY: Regret what? I didn't say I was coming aboard.
MYRA: But why not? I thought it was settled. What's holding you back?
ROY: Come on, Myra, don't talk business here. This is time out.
MYRA: You mean, it would be too tough to give me a turndown here. Easier on home grounds.
ROY: Yes or no. They're both easier at home. Okay?
