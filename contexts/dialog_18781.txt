JOHNNY: I've got five bucks that says someone dies here and now.
ZACH: I'll see that bet.
SAUNDRA: Now where do we go ?
BRUCE: I don't know.
MATTHEW: I thought you made this place ?
BRUCE: I did, but this room has four exits and only one opens, it's up to them in the control room. There's one right over there. The exit light is on, but he can change it.
