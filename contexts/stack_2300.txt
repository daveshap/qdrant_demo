Skyrim NPC\u2019s are attacking me for no reason I need to go to Riverwood for a quest but every time I show up the NPC\u2019s start wildly attacking me (including ones with the little icon over them indicating they need to be interacted with). I don\u2019t know what to do. Please advise. I am on PS4 and not using mods, if that helps.
