My mother looks through my texts
Im 18 years old, and just found out my mother has been closely monitoring me for up to five years on the internet.
I found out two weeks ago when she accidentally exposed herself, screaming at me because I vented about my step dad being an asshole in a private chat to my friend- she then admitted that she logs into every one of my accounts on everything she knows of, and reads every message I send
This is incredibly unsettling not only because Im an adult and deserve my own privacy, but over the last year Ive sent nudes, shared links to porn art with my friends, and talked about sexual things
Ive threatened to go to the police and report her for this severe invasion of my privacy, but she shot back saying she would report me for slander of her and my stepdad (I vent a lot about them)
I just donâ€™t know what to do, and the paranoia Ive been feeling these last two weeks is making me feel physically sick and suicidal.
