NINOTCHKA: Leon, I would like to ask you something.
LEON: Anything, Ninotchka.
NINOTCHKA: If you don't want to answer, you needn't. But if you do, you must tell me the truth.
LEON: I promise... I swear.
NINOTCHKA: Did you make any change in this room?
LEON: I don't think so.
NINOTCHKA: When I was here before I noticed a photograph of a woman on the desk in a wide silver frame. I thought what a waste of silver. That's all that interested me then. Now I would like to know... what happened to the woman?
