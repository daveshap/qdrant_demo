JACK: I was hoping to get some understanding from you. And I'm not getting it.
MILES: Understanding of what?
JACK: Like I might be in love with another woman.
MILES: In love? Twenty-four hours with some wine-pourer chick and you think you're in love? And give up everything?
JACK: Look who's talking. You've been there.
MILES: Yes I have, and do I look like a happy man? Was all that drama with Brenda a happy thing for me to do? Huh? Was it? Is she a part of my life now?
JACK: This is totally different. I'm talking about avoiding what you're talking about. That's the distinction. I have not made the commitment yet. I am not married. I have not said the words. In a few days, I might get married, and if I do, then I won't be doing stuff like this anymore. Otherwise, what's the whole point of getting married?
MILES: And what about Stephanie? She's a woman -- with a kid. A single mom. What do you think she's looking for? Huh?
JACK: Here's what I'm thinking. We move up here, you and me, buy a vineyard. You design your own wine; I'll handle the business side. Then you get inspired and write a new novel. As for me, if an audition comes along, hell, LA'S two hours away. Not even.
MILES: You're crazy. You've gone crazy.
JACK: What do you care anyway? You don't even like Christine.
MILES: What? Of course I like Christine.
JACK: You said she was shallow. Yeah, and a nouveau riche.
MILES: That was three years ago after that first party!
JACK: Look, Miles, all I know is I'm an actor. All I have is my instinct. My intuition -- that's all I have. And you're asking me to go against it. And that's just wrong.
STEPHANIE: Hi, guys. We should probably get going.
MILES: Where?
