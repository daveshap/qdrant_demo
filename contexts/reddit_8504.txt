Is "The Conservative Case for Carbon Dividend", a legitimate Republican solution to Climate Change?
Elder Republican statesman and executives (Outside of active Government) have put forth a proposal for a 40$/ton Carbon Tax which would be returned to consumers through a quarterly dividend. It would coincide with repeal of current environmental regulations such as the Clean Power Plan. [Link to their proposal.](https://www.clcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/TheConservativeCaseforCarbonDividends.pdf?link_id=0&can_id=0bf39f3935aa7c3418f85f84dfdc431d&source=email-release-carbon-tax-center-backs-climate-leadership-councils-carbon-tax-proposal&email_referrer=release-carbon-tax-center-backs-climate-leadership-councils-carbon-tax-proposal&email_subject=release-carbon-tax-center-backs-climate-leadership-councils-carbon-tax-proposal)

I had two main questions: 

1. Is this a legitimate solution to reducing carbon emissions and tackling climate change? 
This was answered to some extent from previous NeutralPolitics discussion [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/50h6gw/is_there_any_evidence_in_practice_which_suggests/)

2. What I am more curious about is if there is any political support on this from either side? and is passing this through Congress a legitimate possibility?
