How to break down consciousness/soul from an alchemical perspective I am trying to describe consciousness from a magic elementalist perspective.  I've dug through a ridiculous amount of pages of occult alchemical lore without success. My goal is to learn if students and/or practitioners described the human soul/consciousness with respect to elemental energies. My world has many tie-ins to the occult and alchemical genres, and so I am trying to define the soul with respect to them.  My question is: in the logic of alchemical practice, what reasonably associates/describes human decision making concepts with elemental attributes?Clarification: I am looking for some existing thought(references) that attempts to roadmap this out.
