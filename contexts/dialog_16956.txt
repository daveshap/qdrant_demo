ROSANNA: Where do I find you?
CREASY: I'll call you tomorrow.
CREASY: What do you know about the cop? Tazinari. The one who made the ransom drop with Samuel Ramos?
ROSANNA: He's an old fashioned patrone with the worst reputation. He's high on my hit list.
CREASY: Where does he live?
ROSANNA: He lives in a Judicial Compound. He travels by motorcade. He has better protection than George Bush. Even more importantly he is part of La Hermanidad. His reach is far and wide.
CREASY: Give me the address.
