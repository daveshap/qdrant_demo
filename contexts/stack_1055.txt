Can I delete old snap folders which used to be installed but remain on system? If I look in /home/username/snap I have some folders for previously installed and uninstalled programs.Am I safe to delete these folders, is there a cleaner or auto way of doing this when snaps are uninstalled?If I run the command snap list or snap list -all they aren't shown.I am running Ubuntu 18.04LTS
