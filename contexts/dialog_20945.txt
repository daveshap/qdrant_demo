ZIRA: Cornelius, why do you insist on provoking him?
CORNELIUS: No creature can survive in that part of the Forbidden Zone. I've been there. I've seen it.
ZIRA: 'Then how do you account for me?,
CORNELIUS: I don't. And I'm not going to try.
ZIRA: But what about your theory? The existence of someone like Taylor might prove it.
CORNELIUS: Zira, are you trying to get my head cut off?
ZIRA: Don't be foolish. If it's true, they'll have to accept it.
CORNELIUS: No, they won't -
ZIRA: Cornelius has developed a brilliant hypothesis -
CORNELIUS: It's probably wrong --
ZIRA: -- that the ape evolved from a lower order of primate, possibly man. In his trip to the Forbidden Zone he discovered traces of a culture older than recorded time -
CORNELIUS: The evidence was very meager --
ZIRA: You didn't think so then.
CORNELIUS: That was before Dr. Zaius and half the Academy said the idea was heresy.
ZIRA: How can scientific truth be heresy? What if Taylor is exactly the proof you needed? A mutation. A missing link between the unevolved primate and the ape -
