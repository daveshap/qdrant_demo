If you have kids and are worried about paying for college (or your kids incurring debt), work for one that offers free tuition to your kids as a benefit.
I just found out my friend, who got a job as a janitor at a very good, very expensive college, will have free tuition for his kids if they get in.  That amounts to $200k per 4 year degree.
