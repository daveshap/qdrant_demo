Question about current issues facing those in Campus Activities
Hello r/Studentaffairs
I'm a current Master's student working on my Masters in Higher Education Administration.  I have an assignment coming up that is asking me to learn more about a Functional area of Student Affairs that I'm considering as a career.  Part of the paper is learning more about the the history of this area, current issues facing this area, and also learning about how CAS standards are applied at different Universities.  I've already gotten in contact with NACA in hopes of getting a recent copy of their magazine, but other than that I'm a little lost of where to go next to gain this context.  

Are there any professionals out there in this area that would be willing to help guide me on where to look, or speak about some of the larger trends/conversations happening currently in a general sense?  Any help is appreciated.
