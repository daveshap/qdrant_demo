ROSE: I didn't mean to bite him. He was hitting Horton with a blackjack in the meanest way and... and I bit him accidental.
DADDY: I have to go back to the hotel. I'm on duty at the desk and who knows a quest might arrive. I will see you at suppertime, Rose.
ROSE: I didn't mean to bite him, I really didn't.
DADDY: I will see you at suppertime, Rose.
ROSE: Yes, air.
DOLL: What is Rose going to do? Where can she go?
BUDDY: They've been in there the longest kind of time. I can't stand it, I gotta find out what's going on.
DOLL: You better not snoop, Daddy'll kill you!
DADDY: I'm sorry, darlin', I hate it as much as you do.
MOTHER: Well, she does seem to cause a lot of trouble, I admit. But she doesn't mean any harm and it'll break the children's hearts, they all love her.
DADDY: It's because of the children she's got to go. I don't want to be holier-than-thou, but the girl doesn't have the same outlook we do. Morals don't mean a thing to her, not a thing, and we can't have a girl like that in this house.
MOTHER: Who is to say our morals are better than hers? But maybe you're right. She could... influence Dolly...
DADDY: That is exactly what I'm afraid of. The girl has got to go, darlin'.
MOTHER: But morals come from the heart, not from rigid rules and empty laws. And in her heart Rose has never hurt anyone and she never would. Therefore, she's not immoral. Not really.
DADDY: Now look, darlin', this is no time to go off into the fourth dimension.
MOTHER: But what I said is the simple truth. And now I see something else, I see more deeply into it...
