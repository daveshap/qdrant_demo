JACK: Hey Peter, lemme ask you a question. An old girlfriend calls you out of the blue on Christmas Eve...
LASSITER: You suddenly having trouble getting dates?
JACK: Not by a long shot.
LASSITER: Then leave it in the past. Old flames are like old tax returns. You keep `em in the file cabinet for three years and then you cut `em loose.
JACK: I'll leave from the office tomorrow afternoon. Call the group. Schedule an emergency strategy session for noon.
ADELLE: That'll be a nice little holiday treat.
