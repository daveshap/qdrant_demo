I'm slowly killing myself
The worst part of an addiction is the realization of self-deterioration, and not being able to stop yourself. For 3 years I have been caught in the repetitive hell of heroin addiction. My method of consumption is smoking instead of shooting, but that's no excuse. I have stolen from my parents, my brothers, and strangers. I have sold things that I held dearly, things that were given as gifts from loved ones, things that I missed as soon as I left the pawn shop. But it didn't matter, as long as I was on my way to meet my connect, I was okay. I'm tired. I'm exhausted of living like this, and I'm not even as bad as people I've come across. Every days is the same as the last, and the same as the next. You turn into the same person as everyone else in your situatuon. You live for your next high, and that's it. Nothing else matters. But it does to me. I'm still young, and I don't want to end my potential at a decent life when I know I hold the power to change it. I'm tired of hating myself, being mad at myself for putting myself in the position I'm in today. I have no one to blame to me, and that's what bothers me the most. Tomorrow is going to be different. And people may not believe that, but they don't have to. I only have to convince one person that I'm through with this part of my life... Me. Here goes nothing.
