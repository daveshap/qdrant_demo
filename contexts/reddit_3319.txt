What are some decent-paying jobs that involve "creating" and working from home or anywhere you want (mobile)?
I recently graduated from uni and realized what I did was not was I wanted. I have a degree in food science and work in food industries in quality assurance. Food is interesting, but this kind of work is not. It's tedious and routine, I need to change shifts from morning to evening and back every couple weeks, which really affects my sleep schedule, the pay isn't all that great either, and to be honest, I don't even like science that much in the first place. At least not tedious work like this. 90% of graduates end up doing this kind of work. I figured, if I better change to something while I'm young now or I'll end up stuck doing this forever.

I've been wanting to do a career change and came up with a few points that I would really want in a job. I don't know what kind of jobs to look for or what to go back to learn for, but I hope someone may have an idea:

* I think I would enjoy doing a creative sort of job. Anything that allows me to "create" something would satisfy me I think. However, the last two points are far more important to me. If there is no such job that can satisfy all three, then the last two would do fine if possible.

* I hate the idea of being controlled by your job to move to where you find work, so I would like a mobile job that can be done working from home, or anywhere else. I assume, working on something that involves a computer, or at least a job that is fine with you being anywhere as long as you are able to connect with the employer through phone or computer.

* Lastly, a decent pay, or something that can work up to a decent pay. I was lead to believe that creative jobs don't pay well in school, which was what led me into going into the sciences. I obviously need to still support myself and have something that can give me a decent amount of money to save up and use for certain goals.
