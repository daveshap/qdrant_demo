Question regarding graduate assistantship eligibility
I’m not sure if this differs by university, but here goes:

If I earn a masters degree, and decide to pursue a 2nd masters degree in a different field soon after, would I be ineligible to obtain a graduate assistantship position opportunity towards that second masters?

I’m considering earning a masters degree in teaching, and want to know if I decide later on to earn a second masters in a different field will I be ineligible for financial aid and/or GA positions.

Thank you.
