FLYNN: What about our friend - Sark?
TRON: Probably decided not to pursue us, The Sea of Simulation is tricky.. lot of illusions...rough navigating. Programs have a way of just... disappearing here.
FLYNN: Not us, I hope.
TRON: Not with this disk. I'm going to check on the beam connection, Yori. You two can keep a watch out for grid bugs.
FLYNN: Boy the view from up here... you know the territory?
YORI: A little ... Over there, the Mountains of Data... and I think that's the Silicon Valley...
FLYNN: What's wrong with that area?
YORI: The MCP blasted it... There are very few domains left with any power at all.
FLYNN: Lousy utility companies ... they're the same wherever you go.
