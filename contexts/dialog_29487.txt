RENTON: What was your price?
SICK BOY: Four Grand.
RENTON: But you don't have the money?
SICK BOY: We're two thousand short.
RENTON: That's tough.
SICK BOY: Come on, Mark, every cunt knows you've been saving up down in London.
RENTON: Sorry, boys, I don't have two thousand pounds.
BEGBIE: Yes, you fucking do. I've seen your statement.
RENTON: Jesus.
BEGBIE: Two thousand, one hundred and thirty- three pounds.
RENTON: Four kilos. That's what -- Ten years' worth? Russian sailors? Mikey Forrester? What the fuck are you on these days? You've been to jail, Spud, so what's the deal -- like it so much you want to go back again?
SPUD: I want the money, Mark, that's all.
BEGBIE: If everyone keeps their mouth shut, there'll be no one going to jail.
RENTON: It's so simple. We buy it at four grand, we punt it at twenty to this guy that Sick Boy knows, and he punts it at sixty. Everyone's happy, everyone's in profit. I put up two. I come away with six.
DIANE: Unless you get caught.
RENTON: So long as everyone keeps their mouths shut, we'll not be getting caught.
DIANE: So why have you told me about it?
RENTON: Well, you're not going to tell anyone, are you, and besides, I thought we could meet up afterwards, maybe go somewhere together.
DIANE: I've got a boyfriend, Mark.
RENTON: What? Steady like?
DIANE: That's right: 'going steady' for four weeks now.
RENTON: And what age are you? Thirteen? Fourteen?
DIANE: Sixteen next month.
RENTON: Happy birthday.
DIANE: What do you think -- I should be carrying a torch for you?
RENTON: So, what's he like?
DIANE: Well, he's young and he's healthy.
