I don't think I can do relationships.
Every time I decide to date someone, no matter how crazy I am about them or how long I've wanted to be with them or how compatible we are, I want out of the relationship after a two to four months. I lose interest in sharing myself and being open all the time. I get frustrated with everything they do, even though they don't change their behavior and I know that, rationally, these things shouldn't bother me. I start to lose romantic interest, but I still really care about the person and want them in my life. If we giddily made any future plans together, I start doubting them and wanting to carry through with them by myself. 

I don't like this. I don't like hurting people when I leave them. I don't like being annoyed with people I truly care about. I don't like that I can't hold a relationship with anyone. I don't want to be alone my whole life. After being single for a while, I'll usually desire a relationship again. I don't understand why I always want out of them. Half the time, I want to get back with my ex. I don't like that I am this way.

I've broken too many hearts, including my own. Maybe I just need to be alone forever.
