I would prefer + (to infinitive) + rather than + (bare infinitive) or (to infinitive)? I've found this during my studies:<blockquote>  I would prefer to die in a car crash rather than to die in my sleep.</blockquote>Is this correct? Shouldn't it be:<blockquote>  I would prefer to die in a car crash rather than die in my sleep.</blockquote>I thought you should use bare infinitive after rather than (in this type of sentences). Also, can I shorten the second sentence to:<blockquote>  I would prefer to die in a car crash rather than in my sleep.</blockquote>...because it's the same verb (die)?
