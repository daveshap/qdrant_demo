When you’re so used to feeling anxious that being calm and relaxed feels like a high
I’ve been feeling very calm and relaxed recently, and because I was so accustomed to confusion and worry, mainly due to not having a clue how to behave socially and being fearful of having a meltdown whenever I’m at work and people all talk at me at once, being in such a calm state felt like, to me, I was high. As in, stoned or dosed up on benzos. I should mention I didn’t actually take anything. Who else has noticed this? It made me realise how intrusive and disruptive anxiety actually is, and that despite letting it exist, it’s way too much of a plastic bag over my head to ignore, which is why I am going to make more of an effort to counter it instead of living with it.
