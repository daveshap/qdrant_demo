mp3s set as \"Audiobook\" have stopped showing up in iBooks For a while now I've been importing mp3s, setting them as \"Audiobook\" and listening to them via iBooks, like normal. However, for some unknown reason a few weeks ago, this stopped happening: Even though they show up in \"Audiobooks\" on iTunes, they WILL NOT show up in iBooks anymore\u2014they still appear in the Music app, like a regular mp3. Nothing I have tried will force it to show up in iBooks again.Edit, to clarify: The problem is that I add an MP3 audiobook to my iPhone via iTunes in the normal matter, but it shows up in \"Music\" and NOT \"iBooks\" EVEN THOUGH I set the file type as \"Audiobook.\" iTunes\u2014on multiple computers!\u2014correctly shows the audiobook, but not on the phone. Furthermore, I deleted an old audiobook on the phone yet iBooks STILL shows it!This is on iOS 10.3.3, iTunes 12.7.1.14, and reconfirmed on iOS 11.2.2, iTunes 12.7.2.58.
