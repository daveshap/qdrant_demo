My parents took $8,000 from me.
I'll try to keep this a little brief.

I'm a sophomore in college. My grandma on my dad's side gave my 2 younger sisters and myself $8,000 each in trust funds when we were very young.

Last year, I commuted between campus and my parents house. Because of this, I agreed with my parents that using *some* of that money, and not *all* of that money for a car would be the best option.

I felt like saving money in that fund for emergencies like rising tuition or car problems/insurance was a great idea, and it would give me a cushion if I needed it.

My father took all $8,000 and bought a truck, without consulting me. I never drove that truck when I was home, in fact I was banned from it. Instead I drove the family Crown Vic.

Now I'm an RA on campus. In order to continue to pay for tuition here (it's a private school) I have to keep another off campus job. This new job is about 15 minutes or so away. 

Tomorrow is my first day at this job. I wasn't able to find a ride with our on campus shuttle to get there, so I decided to call home and ask for a ride. I felt that was logical, because my sister was available for said ride, and wanted to give it to me. So I set up plans with her for that

My mother called me on the phone, was very angry that I would "have such guts" to ask for a ride to my job when I should be able to find rides. "It wasn't in our agreement"

I was also told by my father that our shuttle service runs *until* noon on weekends. It in fact *doesn't* run before noon.

What would you suggest I'd do in this situation?


Longer than I thought, but 
**TL;DR My parents took $8000 to buy a car I never drove, now I don't even have any car and I'm still short a lot of money for college**
