HATSUE: We discussed that. And decided not to.
HOOKS: Why not?
HATSUE: Because the facts could be misconstrued as murder.
HOOKS: But if truth was on your side, whatever were you worried about?
HATSUE: Trials aren't only about truth, Mr. Hooks. Even though they should be. They're about what people <u>believe</u> is true.
HOOKS: So you hid the truth. Deliberately.
HATSUE: We were afraid. Silence seemed better. To come forward seemed like a mistake.
HOOKS: Well, it seems to me...
HOOKS: Doesn't it seem to <u>you</u>, Mrs. Miyamoto, that your mistake was in being deceitful? Concealing information during the course of a sheriff's investigation.
HATSUE: It seems human. To me.
