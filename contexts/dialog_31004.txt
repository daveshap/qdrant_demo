TED: I have to admit, I always felt... different.
JULIE: Different how? Different like a dwarf at a basketball game? Or different like a lesbian in pumps?
TED: I don't get the distinction.
JULIE: Could everybody else tell you were different, or were you the only one who knew?
TED: I felt limited. I felt confined. I felt like I was suffocating.
JULIE: I see. So more like a tight rope walker who secretly wants to be a trapeze artist.
TED: I guess.
JULIE: Interesting.
