MICHELLE: Shall I leave?
LOUIS: No, you may wait behind the screen.
LIEUTENANT: I would not have disturbed you, Majesty, but you ordered me to keep you informed --
LOUIS: Yes, yes, go on.
LIEUTENANT: Athos, the former Musketeer, has just fought with several of your guard, at the Musketeers' Gate.
LOUIS: Did they kill him?
LIEUTENANT: No. He cut an ear from one of the men, no one else was hurt. Captain d'Artagnan allowed him to leave. Athos was upset about the death of his son, at the front.
LOUIS: Who was Athos seeking? Tell me! Did he try to enter the palace?
LIEUTENANT: ... He did -- but Captain d'Artagnan blocked his way.
LOUIS: You may go, Lieutenant.
LIEUTENANT: Do you want Athos arrested, your Majesty?
LOUIS: Not by you. I will order d'Artagnan to do it.
