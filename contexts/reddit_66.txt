How do I convince my mom to let me get the HPV vaccine?
(Typing on my phone, apologies for any mistakes) I’m a 15 year old girl and at my last doctor appointment, my mom told me to look at the information they gave me and read over it to see if I wanted to get it. The problem is, she said in That Tone, which means “if you don’t choose what I want I’m going to change my mind and get mad at you for even Thinking about the other option and not let you do it.” Please don’t tell me that I’m overreacting, my mom waited until I stained my underwear to tell me about periods, and even then she gave me the minimum info and told me “oh well I thought that you’d just hear things from kids at school or something. She didn’t tell me anything about puberty, I had to find a book in the library. She still hasn’t given me the Talk (kinda grateful for because it would be extremely awkward) and what I do know I learned online, especially about doing it with a girl. She wouldn’t let me get a mug that said “bisexuali-tea” because it said “bisexual,” and said that she wouldn’t be comfortable seeing it, and that it’s more like a gift you’d get at 18 or 21, or a bachelorette party. Anything relating to s*x, she immediately deems as awful. Is there any way I could get it without her consent? I live in Washington State, and I don’t have the ability to put money on my card or withdraw money without her approval, and any money I make goes straight to my bank account. I currently have $90 on my card, would that be enough? I’m sorry for all the questions, but I’m not sure what to do. It’s dangerous out there, and eventually I’ll start going places on my own or dating someone, and anything could happen. I want to be prepared
