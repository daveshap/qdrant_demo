I was planning on job shadowing but should I give up hope now? Are there virtual options for job shadowing?
I wanted to cold email professors, doctors, orthodontists etc about job shadowing but is this no longer a realistic? Should I still cold email and wait for their response? Or is it pointless?

Edit: Are there any opportunities for virtual shadowing to take place? Or opportunities to open in the summer?
