LISA: Mr. Creasy, I wanted to make sure you have everything you need.
CREASY: I'm fine.
LISA: Is the food alright? Maria tells me that you didn't eat.
CREASY: The food's fine. Sometimes I don't eat.
LISA: It insults Maria. Slip it to the dog if you have to... Do you mind if I talk to you for a moment?
LISA: How are you getting along with Pinta?
CREASY: We'll be okay once she realizes I'm not a new toy.
LISA: Yes, she told me. Do you have children, Mr. Creasy?
CREASY: No.
LISA: You should know they're tenacious when they want something. And Pinta wants to be friends.
CREASY: You're paying me to protect her, not amuse her. Right?
CREASY: Look. Maybe this isn't going to work. Maybe you should ask your husband to hire someone... more sociable.
LISA: No, you're right. You were hired to protect her, that's enough. I'm confident you'll do that.
