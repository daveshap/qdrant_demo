GRACE: You mean they let you go through the officer training course and then said you were too old for a commission?
CLIVE: That's it.
GRACE: Why didn't they say that before you started?
CLIVE: I wasn't too old when I started the course. I was too old when it finished.
GRACE: What are you going to be then?
CLIVE: A clerk. I'm doing a typing course. I'll be typing for England.
