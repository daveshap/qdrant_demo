KIRK: Are you asking me if we are playing out that scenario now, Lieutenant?
SAAVIK: On the test, sir, will you tell me what you did? I'd really like to know.
BONES: Lieutenant, you are looking at the only Starfleet cadet who ever beat the no-win scenario --
KIRK: And almost got tossed out of the Academy...
SAAVIK: How?
KIRK: I reprogrammed the simulation so it was possible to rescue the ship.
SAAVIK: <u>WHAT</u>?
KIRK: I changed the conditions of the test. I received a commendation for original thinking. I don't like to lose.
SAAVIK: Then -- you never faced that situation -- faced death...
BONES: Until now.
KIRK: We each face death every day we're alive, Saavik.
KIRK: Spock, this is Kirk. It's two hours. Are you about ready?
SPOCK'S VOICE: Right on schedule, Admiral. Just give us your coordinates and we'll beam you aboard.
