CANNOT think of ANYTHING that I want to do as a career. It's so frustrating! I've been researching it for years and I'm at my wit's end. Help. I can't do retail anymore, I might go insane. How do I choose when nothing seems to call to me?
When I was a kid, I wanted to be a teacher. Then it turned into a book writer, then I switched to architecture. none of those panned out but I still think about them.

some other ones I've been interested in: entertainer, librarian, lawyer, doctor (lofty, I know, but why not), musician, artist. Just all over the place.

My parents have told me that I should do something creative but that's never panned out. 

And then there's the fact that so many people I know went through the whole college thing and now they're secretaries or working in retail and it scares me and confuses me. What if I waste my money? what if I can't hack it? what if my IQ is low and that's why I have nothing to show? I am so stressed about this. I'm terrified to go back to retail (I quit before covid and now I'm in quarantine-- how am I supposed to get a job like that when I live with vulnerable age groups?!?!!)

Anything you got for me would be a great help. Thank you so much.
