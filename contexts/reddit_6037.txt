Remote working after Covid-19
Has anyone found any good analysis or opinions on the working environment post Covid-19? Otherwise can we have a discussion here about what companies are choosing to do? 

We are still working from home through September. At that time they will reassess. I believe it may be possible that we will have the option to permanently work from home as it appears to be working out well. 

A question I have is that, in the permanent work from home situation, does it mean that we should become geographically free to move about the country, in general? Do we expect to see more remote employees?
