Should I put having a girlfriend as an extra curricular?
Hey guys, I am currently in a relationship and I was wondering if I could put that as an extra curricular activity? I'll put down a few reasons why.

1. Like I do a lot for her and I think colleges need to know that's why some of my test scores were lower than average (1580 SAT and 35 ACT). The week before my SAT, she made us go on a date together, and she gave me really good head and all, but I needed to be studying for the SAT. Because of that lost time, my score dropped by 20 points. I think this will affect my chances at getting into Princeton.
2. She is about a 7/10 while I am about a 9.3/10.  So I feel like I am doing charity/volunteer work by being with her because I have better options. I believe I am helping raise her popularity since I am so attractive, so I should be entitled to service hours.
3. Being with her feels like a part-time job but I have to pay. Do you know how expensive Olive Garden is? Whenever we go I gotta be like girl I know you want to get Pepsi and all, but I'm broke. Speaking of which should I write my essay about how being in this relationship taught me the value of money? Because her Chicken Alfredo was LITERALLY 16 DOLLARS , so I couldn't order an entree and I ate like twelve bread sticks.
4. Also I want to show Colleges that I am a well rounded individual not just some insensitive math nerd. I listen to her from time to time. For instance, 2 months ago she told me she was craving a Crunch Wrap Box from Taco Bell, but that was too expensive so I got her a McChicken instead.

What do you guys think? Should I put this as an extra curricular to show how nice and likable I am?
