Should I leave a voicemail to an employer who reached out to me or just wait until the next day to call when they are open?
I missed a call from an employer who reached out to me on Friday. I was away from home for a few days since I visited my relatives for the holidays. They left a voicemail on Friday and I am just seeing it now on Monday. It's 6:30pm as of late, and they are closed. Should I leave a voicemail that I have heard their voicemail and want to get back in touch with them and to give me a call back. Or should I just wait until tomorrow morning to call?

I am afraid it will look bad that I didn't pick up right away or call back on the same day and just want to notify them as fast as possible that I have received their message and interested in working for their company. 

I also am thinking of what to say to them. I have bad anxiety in general and always blank out.  So far this is what I have wrote down in what to say :

Hello, this is lillypad90 (just using this name for this subreddit). I  am so sorry that I have missed your call on Friday morning, I  am calling in regards to your voicemail about the status of my application for the position as an assistant at your company. I would like to get back in touch and would be more than happy to answer any questions or concerns that you may have. Thank you."

is this ok to say?  Or should I re-word anything or wait until tomorrow morning when they are in office to contact them? 


Thanks
