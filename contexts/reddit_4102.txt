I don’t know what you guys do usually, but i delete or hide people from dating apps if I don’t get response back within a day or two. It saves my time for overthinking or being ghosted. I just move to another one. It’s 21st century, and we are always with our smart phone. There is no fukin way you are too busy to response someone back within a day or two  if you are interested. Cuz if people are really interested in you, they will definitely make some time for you and response you back. 

It has saved my lots of time from overthinking.

Edit: I mean to say only those people who I have been talking for a day and don’t get response within a day or two. I delete those people right away who I don’t even get response back for my first message. Why the fuck you match if you don’t wanna talk? Just swipe left and don’t waste our fukin time
