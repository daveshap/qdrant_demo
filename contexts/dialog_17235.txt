HAWKEYE: How they goin', Losing Preacher? What do you hear from the Pope?
DAGO RED: You talked to Walt?
HAWKEYE: He's parted his moorings.
TRAPPER: We're throwing him a Last Supper. We came to invite you.
HAWKEYE: The Painless Pole plans to cross the Great Divide tonight and we need your help to straighten him out.
DAGO RED: What do you want me to do?
HAWKEYE: Put in one of your fixes. Walt knows he's loused himself with the Church, but it's part of our plan to make him think he has the keys to the kingdom. Which he will think if you grease the skids for him.
DAGO RED: I don't think I can give absolution to a man who's about to commit suicide. It's a mortal sin.
HAWKEYE: What is, Red, the intention or the act?
DAGO RED: I believe it takes both. I'd have to look it up.
HAWKEYE: Just use common sense. Your job is preventing sin, and the way to do that is give him your best Cross Action.
TRAPPER: Or you can let him knock himself out. You personally'd be sending him to his grave.
HAWKEYE: An eternal damnation.
