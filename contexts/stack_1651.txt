Using an opamp with fractionnal gain with supply less than input signal Let's say we have an AC signal that can swing from -15v to +15v max peak to peak. If I use an opamp with the power rails to -5v and +5v, can I get a non clipped output signal if I use a gain of 0.333? Or will op amp failed to recognize anything above/below +/-5 V at it's input even if the required output is within range?Do I need to have my opamp's power rails and specs within the input range or the output range provided that the output have less peak-to-peak swing than the input with my gain of 0.333?The signal I'm talking about is a low, signaling level (about 1mA max) with varying frequencies, like an audio signal.
