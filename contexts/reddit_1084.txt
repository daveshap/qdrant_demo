If you are browsing and read this please take a moment and do this...
 A moment to breathe. Take a minute and:
- stretch your back
- get your shoulders back
- unclench your jaw (important one - thank you u/SaltedBiscuitTV)
- relax your muscles and let your body feel its own weight
- wherever you are, imagine that your scenario is imaginary; you are alone and all noise or people are a sort of movie playing around you
- close your eyes (really, just do it)
- imagine you are in your safest place on earth (your bedroom, an island, near the sea...) -- you should do this as a sort of meditation technique, be careful with dissociation symptoms (I suffer from it but it helps to remove myself from the place I am so you do you!) - thanks to u/veraamber
- inhale deeply and hold it for a couple seconds
- exhale as slow as possible...
- repeat 5 or 10 times
- remember that right at this moment there are thousands of people feeling the same exact thing you are now feeling; you are NOT alone, think about it and feel that connection

Later:
- go on about your day and put the phone down when you can and if possible do something nice that calms you down later - you deserve it! Go for an icecream, snuggle in a nice blanket... 

- if you’re not alone let people know you need a break to feel better, it’s a great first step if you are ashamed of your anxiety or try to hide it

- when you have time, write down in a really small font size a list of things that make you feel calmer or relaxed (reading, music, whatever) - print it and put it in your wallet or anything you carry around because most of the time we just forget to do those things! 

When you feel overwhelmed, read the list and choose an item and DO it. It’s easy for us to fall in the trap of “freezing” and never do the things that we *know* calm us down. I have mine with a list of good things in life/things I enjoy doing/reminders that I’ve struggled for years and... I’m still here!

Have a good morning/afternoon/night, you are NEVER alone <3

EDIT #1: added one more step thanks to u/SaltedBiscuitTV
EDIT #2: thanks to u/veraamber for the reminder on "imagining you're elsewhere" might be harmful to some people
EDIT #3: as I am still in a very agitated mood and my legs are sore from all the stress I just realized... first silver thingy on here x2! It feels amazing that venting while I was having a hard time helped someone out - Thank you! :') 
EDIT #4: Close your eyes after you read all of it ;)
