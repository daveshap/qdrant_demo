What are the historical standards of invoking the Insurrection Act?
President Trump declared that he would deploy ["thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers, military personnel and law enforcement officers"](https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/01/politics/donald-trump-national-address-race/index.html) if needed to restore order in states around the country due to [the protests stemming from the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.](https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/george-floyd-protests-06-01-20/index.html)

[The Insurrection Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurrection_Act) allows the president to deploy military troops within the United States to suppress civil disorder, insurrection, and rebellion, but the act states that unless military troops are requested by a state, the president cannot deploy troops by order unless it becomes "impracticable to enforce federal laws through ordinary proceedings or if states are unable to safeguard its inhabitants' civil rights".

Additionally, [Posse Comitatus Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posse_Comitatus_Act) further limits the president's powers to deploy military troops within the united states, although it does have a specific exclusion for the Insurrection Act.

Which leads me to wonder, what are the historical standards of invoking the Insurrection Act? What were the circumstances behind the invocation?

Has the Insurrection Act ever been invoked but later found to be in violation of the Posse Comitatus Act?
