JOHNNY: What happened to your hair ?
CARMEN: What do you think ? Everyone did it when we got our wings. You don't like it, do you ?
JOHNNY: It's alright, I guess. You hear from anyone made it out of B.A. alive ?
CARMEN: It's funny. Sometimes I forget. Then it hits me, and I can't stop crying.
JOHNNY: I try just to be happy I'm still alive.
CARMEN: You don't look very happy to see me.
JOHNNY: Should I be ?
CARMEN: Johnny... Life is so different from the way it was. One day you'll see what I did was best for both of us.
ZANDER: Everything coposetic, Lieutenant ?
CARMEN: Zander, you remember Johnny ? Zander and I are a flight team now.
ZANDER: Best in the Fleet !
JOHNNY: I get it. This is the part that's best for both of us. Don't do me anymore favors, eh ?
CARMEN: Johnny, wait...
ZANDER: Forget it, Carmen. The Mobile Infantery does a thankless, dirty job, so they naturally tend to be short-tempered, thoughtless and rude.
JOHNNY: You got something to say about the Mobile Infantery ?
ZANDER: You heard me. Wanna make something out of it, private ?
JOHNNY: Not with an officer, no, sir. The M.I. doesn't mint stupid cap troopers.
ZANDER: Let's disregaed rank... Everybody hear that ? Rank is not an issue here.
CARMEN: Zander, please... Let's go !
