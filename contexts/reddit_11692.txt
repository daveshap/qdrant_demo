I feel like an idiot because I'm not sure where on the trans spectrum I am.
I have been a transvestite for more than half my life, and I've had transgender thoughts since I was 13/14. These thoughts are always there, obviously some days stronger than others, and I just don't know how to define myself. Am I transgender, gender-fluid, just struggling, or am I just a guy who likes dressing up and using that as a coping mechanism.. 

I welcome, and will answer, any and all questions you may have.
