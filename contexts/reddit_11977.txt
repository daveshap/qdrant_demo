The internal monsters
Im a 19 yr old male who has so much insecurities 
the first one is my teeth the front two are buck and the rest are crooked however they are  relatively normal clean (i tell myself maybe cleanisees can substitute for their imperfection),another of my inecurities is one of my fingernail is bad like only a part of it,im so ashamed of showing it in publicand now after 3yrs i finally seen this girl who im atracted to and i want to get to know her but my insecurites stop me from apporaching her.I hate these things about me and i cant try to have a relationship if i dont even love myself
