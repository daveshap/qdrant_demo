JUNOT: I believe you sent for me.
NAPOLEON: Yes, yes, please sit down. I will be with you in a moment.
NAPOLEON: Read it back.
BOURRIENNE: To Joseph Bonaparte -- Dear Joseph, I have been informed by my wife of the cold and spiteful treatment she has been receiving at the hands of my family, since my departure. I am also informed that you have refused to pay over to her any of the money I left with you expressly for this purpose. Must you, too, take this opportunity during my absence to indulge the petty jealousies of the Bonaparte family?
NAPOLEON: Oh, shit, that's not right.
