Has there actually been a statistically meaningful increase in hate-crimes since Trump was elected?
The media seems to be implying that hate-crimes are on the rise^1, but as of yet I haven't heard any of the major outlets flat-out say "Hate crimes have risen compared to this time last year...", or similar.

Take for example, [this article^1](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/hate-harassment-incidents-spike-since-donald-trump-election/) from CBS, which claims "According to new numbers from the FBI, hate crimes were up almost 7 percent in 2015. That includes a 67 percent jump in crimes against Muslims."

However, they cited increases in 2015.

[This statement](http://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/rise-in-hate-crimes-following-donald-trump-election-win/) from the Southern Poverty Law Center does not specifically say the percentage of hate-crimes has risen; it simply claims there have been 700 since Trump was elected.

So, does anyone know for sure if there has been a statistically meaningful increase in hate-crimes since Trump was elected?
