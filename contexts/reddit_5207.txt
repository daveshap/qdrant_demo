Terminated 13 years ago still being held against me.
I recently took a civil service exam scored 6 out of several hundred people got an interview. During the interview I was asked a specific question about whether I had ever been asked to resign and I answered yes. I was on my initial probation as a corrections officer and was late twice in 2 months both less than 15 minutes. I totally own this as my screw up but it wasn't due to being totally irresponsible. I joke about not having anything to show for being late like partying hard the night before or something. I was working too much overtime because I was excited about the job and wanted to learn every post in the facility so I could make myself more valuable and less expendable.  This caught up with me and affected my sleep. I was in my 20's and a lot has changed since. Everyone I talked to from the department said that I was railroaded out by a boss notorious for having bad days. Still I take responsibility for my shortcoming but I feel that answering the question honestly cost me this job opportunity 13 years later. Mind you the same department brought back a guy who beat  up his wife and went on the run for a few days. I feel like this will continue to happen whenever I apply for a decent job. I know that lying or omitting is bad and I would never consider it but don't know what to do. I have a squeaky clean record all around and I have worked mediocre jobs with no problems since so I don't think it's fair to have one slight blemish like this hold me back from advancing myself especially when I know of many others have actually screwed up a hell of a lot worse yet some how were able to land on their feet. Any suggestions? And yes I have taken responsibility for my past mistake so I don't need people reminding me of that. Thanks.
