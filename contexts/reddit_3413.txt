I‘m so tired of the “The more you ignore them, the more interested in you the other person gets”. Because it’s so real.
I just realized that at least in my case, this cliché is absolutely true. With every person I’ve dated, the more I play it cool and don’t show too much excitement about seeing them in general, the greater the chances of them wanting to see me and to lead into a relationship.
And it bugs me the most because sometimes I just wanna be straightforward and really show how happy and excited I am about certain someone, but that generally leads to them losing all interest. Playing it cool sucks but also works. Why is this? Is it ingrained in our culture? What’s going on?
