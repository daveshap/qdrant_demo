Undergrad’s last summer: Intern, startup or travel?
Hey Redditors, I’m an undergraduate from Singapore in my penultimate year of study. Next summer will be my last summer in my student life ever and I’m having a dilemma on how to spend that summer.

Here’s the thing tho: I’ve already done 5 internships so far - including the one I’m on now for winter internship at a reputable management consulting firm. I already secured another management consulting internship in Tokyo next summer (which will bring total internships before graduation to 6, or more than 1 year in duration) ...but it’s only one month. 

So I have 2+ months left and I’m wondering if I should try to get another internship, pursue one of my startup ideas (I’ve done preliminary research on these and it just needs to be given time to work on) or just let it all go and go travel and enjoy the last parts of my student life. (Made some money off crypto and I think that can bring me maybe around parts of Asia) maybe get a divemaster license idk

So yeah I’m having the dilemma because interning will give me more career exposure so I can choose better when I actually choose a job, but I also feel the need to cherish whatever’s left of my student youth. 

What do you guys think?
