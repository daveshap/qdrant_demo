THELMA: Louise?
LOUISE: Yes, Thelma?
THELMA: You're not gonna give up on me, are ya?
LOUISE: What do you mean?
THELMA: You're not gonna make some deal with that guy, are you? I mean, I just wanna know.
LOUISE: No, Thelma. I'm not gonna make any deals.
THELMA: I can understand if you're thinkin' about it. I mean, in a way, you've got something to go back for. I mean Jimmy and everything.
LOUISE: Thelma, that is not an option.
THELMA: But I don't know... something's crossed over in me and I can't go back. I mean, I just couldn't live...
LOUISE: I know. I know what you mean. I don't wanna end up on the damn Geraldo Show.
LOUISE: He said they're charging us with murder.
THELMA: Eeuww.
LOUISE: And we have to decide whether we want to come out of this dead or alive.
THELMA: Gosh, didn't he say anything positive at all?
THELMA: Louise, do you think we should change cars, get another car?
LOUISE: Sure... You know how to hotwire a car?
THELMA: No.
LOUISE: Well, let me know when you figure it out.
THELMA: You awake?
LOUISE: You could call it that. My eyes are open.
THELMA: Me too. I feel awake.
LOUISE: Good.
THELMA: Wide awake. I don't remember ever feelin' this awake. Everything looks different. You know what I mean. I know you know what I mean. Everything looks new. Do you feel like that? Like you've got something to look forward to?
LOUISE: We'll be drinkin' margaritas by the sea, Mamasita.
THELMA: We can change our names.
LOUISE: We can live in a hacienda.
THELMA: I wanna get a job. I wanna work at Club Med.
LOUISE: Yes! Yes! Now what kind of deal do you think that cop can come up with to beat that?
THELMA: It'd have to be pretty good.
LOUISE: It would have to be pretty damn good.
LOUISE: We should head a little further in. There's not that many roads in this state. I want to try to hit Mexico somewhere not so close to New Mexico. They probably wanna kill us in New Mexico.
THELMA: You're drivin'.
THELMA: Oh my God! Louise! Look! Look! See if that's him!
LOUISE: It's him. He's got California plates. It's the same guy.
THELMA: Pass him!
THELMA: Hi!
TRUCKER: Hi there! You alright?
THELMA: We're fine! How are you?
TRUCKER: Grrrreat!
