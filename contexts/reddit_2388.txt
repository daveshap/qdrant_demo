Anyone feel like life isn’t the way they imagined it would turn out?
I worked super hard in this field I thought I would be passionate about and now two years later I am completely lost with what it is I want to do. I don’t find fulfillment and only look forward to Saturdays. I’m 25 and feel like I am too old to start over because all my friends already have moved on in other jobs and if I started a new career it would be another 4-5 years of work. Has anyone ever defied the odds and started over?
