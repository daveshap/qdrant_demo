DOOM: Being caught breaking and entering is not very good advertising for a detective. What were you looking for, Mr. Valiant?
VALIANT: Ask her...
JESSICA RABBIT: Last week some heavy breather wanted one of my nylons as a souvenir. Maybe that's what he was after?
VALIANT: Look, doll, if I wanted underwear, I woulda broken into Frederick's of Hollywood. I was lookin' for Marvin Acme's will.
DOOM: Marvin Acme had no will. I should know, the probate is in my court.
VALIANT: He had a will, all right. She took it off Acme the night she and R.K. Maroon knocked him off. Then she set up her loving husband to take the fall.
