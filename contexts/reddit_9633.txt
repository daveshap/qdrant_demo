How much does prestige matter in a HIED masters program?
I have offers from two schools, UMich and University of North Texas. UNT is basically free, and it's personally the choice I want to make because it's in the same area as my undergrad. But UMich is relatively affordable with a combination of scholarships and assistantships, and I know it's prestigious. Is it worth paying for the more prestigious program? Or does it really not matter, and I can take the cheaper option?
