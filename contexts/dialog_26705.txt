MIKE: And what if I don't want to give up on her?
ROB: You don't call.
MIKE: But you said I shouldn't call if I wanted to give up on her.
ROB: Right.
MIKE: So I don't call either way.
ROB: Right.
MIKE: So what's the difference?
ROB: The only difference between giving up and not giving up is if you take her back when she wants to come back. See, you can't do anything to make her want to come back. You can only do things to make her not want to come back.
MIKE: So the only difference is if I forget about her or pretend to forget about her.
ROB: Right.
MIKE: Well that sucks.
ROB: It sucks.
MIKE: So it's almost a retroactive decision. So I could, like, let's say, forget about her and when she comes back make like I just pretended to forget about her.
ROB: Right... or more likely the opposite.
MIKE: Right... Wait, what do you mean?
ROB: I mean first you'll pretend not to care, not call -- whatever, and then, eventually, you really won't care.
MIKE: Unless she comes back first.
ROB: Ah, see, that's the thing. Somehow they don't come back until you really don't care anymore.
MIKE: There's the rub.
ROB: There's the rub.
MIKE: Thanks, man. Sorry we always talk about the same thing all the time...
ROB: Hey man, don't sweat it.
MIKE: ...It's just that you've been there. Your advice really helps.
ROB: No problem.
MIKE: Rob, I just want you to know, you're the only one I can talk to about her.
ROB: Thanks. Thanks, man.
