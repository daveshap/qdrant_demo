RAYMOND: Rita. Rita.
RITA: What? What?
RAYMOND: Look.
RITA: Oh.
RAYMOND: It's Cosmo's moon.
RITA: What are you talking about, Raymond? Cosmo can't own the moon.
RAYMOND: I mean it's that moon I was talking about at dinner. Is he down there? No.
RITA: Is who down there?
RAYMOND: Cosmo.
RITA: What would he be doing down there?
RAYMOND: I don't know.
RITA: You know, in this light, and with that expression on your face, you look about twenty-five years old.
