ELENA: Oh lord. You think I'm so dense. And now you want to be seen with your dense wife at the cocktail party. You want to wear that ridiculous shirt which doesn't go with those pants at all. You want to wear that, and you want me to shake hands with your friends and make conversation and dress up in an outfit that shows a lot of cleavage and you're not going to accord me the respect of talking honestly about this... You don't really know what this feels like.
BEN: Sure I do. Do I know what loneliness feels like? Sure I do. I know a lot about it, if that's what you mean.
ELENA: Benjamin. That's supposed to explain it?
ELENA: We're going to the Halford's. The number's on the calendar in the kitchen. We should be home around 11.
WENDY: Is it a big party? A big neighborhood party?
ELENA: I suppose. Why?
WENDY: Just curious. If there's a problem, I guess I'll just call you there to interrupt.
ELENA: What sort of problems are you planning exactly?
WENDY: Oh I thought I'd steal the station wagon, drive up to a commune. Or set the house on fire. You know.
ELENA: Just bundle up. It's supposed to freeze tonight. We'll see you in the morning.
