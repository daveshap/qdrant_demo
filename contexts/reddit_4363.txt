Does anybody else have physical pain and discomfort when they're really depressed?
I've asked this to some people and most of the time they dont get or seem confused. But for me when I'm really doing poorly I physically hurt all over especially in my joints; and I feel general discomfort all over like my skin is too tight or is sore somehow. Does anybody else experience this at all?
