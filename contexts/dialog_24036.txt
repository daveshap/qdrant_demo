CHRISTY: A convent? They put me in a convent? What's the problem? Wasn't there any more room in Hell?
MOTHER SUPERIOR: What is your full name? Your Christian name?
CHRISTY: Mother Theresa. Gandhi. Don't you understand? This is all a mistake. I'm the good guy. I'm the witness. And I'm being punished!
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Your name?
CHRISTY: Christy. Christy Van Cartier.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Enough joking.
CHRISTY: That's my real name! Currently I'm a singer. Sort of.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Very well.
CHRISTY: Oh my God. This isn't happening, tell me this isn't happening. It's a nightmare, I'm back at St. Anne's!
MOTHER SUPERIOR: St. Anne's?
CHRISTY: Parochial school. Akron. St. Android's.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: You were unhappy?
CHRISTY: I was expelled! When I was fifteen?
MOTHER SUPERIOR: The reason?
CHRISTY: Beats me! What do you think? Smoking! Heavy petting, without a chaperone. Heavy petting, with the chaperone. And wearing a black bra, under my uniform. The demon bra.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: I see.
CHRISTY: You see? You see? I have to get out of here I have to make a phone call. Don't you get it? I'm in a convent! You're a nun!
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Sit down.
CHRISTY: What?
