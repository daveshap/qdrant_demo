BRAD: I think we took the wrong fork a few miles back.
JANET: Oh dear! But then where did the motorcyclists come from?
BRAD: Hmmm ... Well, I guess we will have to turn back.
JANET: What was that bang?
BRAD: We must have a blow-out.
JANET: Oh...
BRAD: You'd better sit here and keep warm while I go for help.
JANET: But where will you go? We're in the middle of nowhere.
BRAD: Didn't we pass a castle back down the road a few miles? Maybe they have a telephone I might use.
JANET: I'm coming with you.
BRAD: There's no point both of us getting wet.
JANET: I'm coming with you. Besides, darling, the owner of the phone might be a beautiful woman and you may never come back.
