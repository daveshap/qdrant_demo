STU: You're mad at me. Great. You have every right to be. But we're both mad at Dark Town. We're both mad at Hypnos.
DEATH: Oh, sure. Now you're gonna tell me it was all <u>his</u> idea. You were completely innocent -
STU: I'm not going to tell you that. I wanted that E- ticket. I wanted it so bad I'd stare <u>you</u> right in the face to get it - and I'd do the same again.
DEATH: <u>Why</u>??
STU: I have a girl up there. And I never - I should've - I just want to tell her I love her.
DEATH: I'm a simple man. I'm just doing my job. I <u>enjoy</u> my job. Why does everyone want to make it difficult for me? Stealing tickets, switching bodies...it is <u>so</u> <u>irresponsible</u>.
STU: Death, I'm trying to make things right. Take my soul. Turn me into a paper doll. But give me just one lousy hour.
DEATH: Well - you'd need a body.
DEATH: If it wasn't for that comic strip of yours, I wouldn't be doing this. But a good chuckle is darned hard to come by. <i></i> That one where Monkeybone stole the soap cake out of the urinal - I thought I would die.
STU: Coming from you, that's quite a compliment.
DEATH: <i>De nada</i>. Now, come here...bend over...before I change my mind.
STU: Bend over?
