Who should pay for the date?
I’m a physician (35f) and have recently started dating. I’m of the thought that women and men should spilt the costs of dates. For instance, I’ve had them take me out and pay for everything and then I reciprocate on the next date. I was just talking to two guys at the hospital and they both agreed that men should pay for EVERYTHING in the early dating phase. What do you all do?
