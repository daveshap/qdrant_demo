I'm not sure my new job is such a good idea...
First off, a bit of background... I was unemployed for almost a year, until I finally got called back from a place. The thing is... It's a call centre.

Don't get me wrong, there's nothing inherently bad about call centres. It's just that I'm so incredibly nervous talking to people. I find it really difficult to talk with people I don't know.

I finished my training stuff last week, but tomorrow I start my first full shift actually on the phones and I am terrified. 

I'm also really worried I'm just not going to be very good and that I'll end up just losing my job anyways. I'm considering leaving because I really don't think I'll be able to do it, but this is the first job I've had in almost a year so I really can't afford to do that.

UPDATE: So I did my first real day on the phones yesterday. It was a bit of a disaster. I felt like I knew nothing (although luckily for the first 2 weeks on the phones we have extra support because no one knows what they're doing this early on the job). I also am having a bit of a tough time distancing myself from the people calling in, I need to get a thicker skin and grow a bit of a backbone because people yelling at me is starting to get to me after just my first day. 

Well, I'm off to day 2 now. Wish me luck.
