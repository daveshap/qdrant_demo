RICK: You always were sneaky, Stan, very sneaky.
STAN: Rick, marriage will be good for you. It's done wonders for me.
RICK: True, you're a lot handsomer now. Don't you have enough blood already?
STAN: You won't miss a thing about being single... The wild parties, the different girls every night, running around like a maniac... God, I miss that.
RICK: Stan, you're depressing me... Hey, I didn't know you were going to fill 'er up. Just take a couple of gallons, okay?
RICK: That's an even trade... a cotton ball for all my blood.
STAN: Okay, Rick, all finished. I can't wait for that bachelor party... I need the action.
