SALVATORE: I don't care. I'll wait.
ELENA: For what?
SALVATORE: For you to fall in love with me too. Listen carefully. Every night, when I get off work, I'll come and wait beneath your window. Every night. When you change your mind, open your window. That's all. I'll understand...
PRIEST: You understand now? You see it clearly?
ALFREDO: Oh yes, father. Now everything's clear.
PRIEST: And the next time don't go around saying such heresy. You survived the fire at the movie house. But no one can save you from the fire of Hell!
