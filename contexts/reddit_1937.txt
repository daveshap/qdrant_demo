Anyone else fucking hate their grade?
Im not exaggerating when I say this: the 6-13 ranked kids (out of 253) in my grade are actually delusional. They skip school when they have tests so they can get all the answers the next Day. They even get the previous years binders so they can organizationally cheat on every exam they can.  Sorry for the rant but first period today 3 of the kids who are all friends were absent....
