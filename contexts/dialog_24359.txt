CLEDUS: This is Bandit II. Now, where the hell are you?
BANDIT: On two lane blacktop. Mile marker six-one. How we doin' on time?
CLEDUS: Thirty-eight minutes ahead of schedule.
BANDIT: What's your twenty?
CLEDUS: I'm 'bout four miles ahead of you, turkey.
BANDIT: Not for long, you ain't.
VOICE: Breaker. Breaker.
BANDIT: Go breaker.
VOICE: Bandit, I just thought I'd lay a Smokey report on you.
BANDIT: Go head on, breaker.
VOICE: I would say your future's looking dim, boss.
BANDIT: What's your twenty and what's your handle?
VOICE: My handle's Smokey Bear and I got you by the tail.
BANDIT: That's a Texas cop. What the hell's he doing in Arkansas?
KATE: I don't know. Maybe Jerry Jeff sent the heat after us.
BANDIT: A Texas Bear in Arkansas. Something's up and at this point in my life, I don't want to know what it is.
