Does anyone else feel a sense of calm and peace when thinking about suicide?
I do, and it scares me. I used to feel panicked and anxious when thinking about suicide and, which would end up in a decent crying session.

For a while now however, I just feel calm and relieved when thinking about it. It's nice to feel that there's always a solution available if things go badly wrong, or if I'm too stressed, when all my life I've only heard to just suck it up and keep moving on to fuck things up all over again.

I just want to know if anyone else has had this, because thinking like that scares me. I don't want to end it, I know my family cares about me, and I don't want them to suffer.

I've had these thoughts for a long time now. The difference is that I don't think negatively about suicide now.

Thank you for taking the time for reading, please share your thoughts/experience if you can and want to. It would help me feel I'm not alone.
