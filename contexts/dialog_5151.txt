KAYLEIGH: So how's tricks? Sorry, occupational humor.
EVAN: I get it. You can drop it now.
KAYLEIGH: Oh, I'm sorry. Does my line of work make you uncomfortable, precious?
EVAN: No. Just that you need to hurt me with it. I've been where you've been.
KAYLEIGH: Ha! Where's that?
EVAN: The bottom. When you're just a piece of meat waiting for the next attack.
KAYLEIGH: What's happened to you?
EVAN: You wouldn't believe me. I mean, people always say, You wouldn't believe me"
KAYLEIGH: I've seen some sickening shit. I don't blink twice anymore, especially in your case.
EVAN: Why's that?
KAYLEIGH: Because you're... different.
EVAN: Different? How?
KAYLEIGH: Let me ask you a question. Just a little one that's been gnawing at me for years.
EVAN: Yeah?
KAYLEIGH: On the bridge. How did you know that Tommy had your dog? That was no fucking hunch.
EVAN: Do you remember when I was a kid and I had those blackouts?
KAYLEIGH: You're right, Evan, I don't believe you.
EVAN: I never thought you would. That's why I've never bothered to tell a soul until now, and why I never will again.
KAYLEIGH: I'm the only person you've told? That's a great line. Does that make other girls swoon? Do they actually eat up this bullshit?
EVAN: I couldn't give a shit if you believe me or not, and frankly I'm too tired to prove it to you.
KAYLEIGH: Oh? There's proof now?
EVAN: Shit. I dunno. How would I know about the twin moles on your inner thigh?
KAYLEIGH: Anyone with fifty bucks could tell you that.
EVAN: Then forget that. How about... you prefer the smell of a skunk to flowers, you hate cilantro because for reasons unknown to you, it reminds you of your step-sister.
