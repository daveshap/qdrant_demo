JACOB: Why won't you answer me?
JEZZIE: Cause you know goddamn well who I am.
JACOB: I don't know you.
JEZZIE: You've lived with me for two years.
JACOB: That doesn't mean shit. Where do you come from, huh? And I don't mean Indiana.
JEZZIE: What do you want me to say? My mother's tummy?
JACOB: You know goddamn well what I mean.
JEZZIE: You're out of your fucking mind. I'm not gonna stand around here gettin' interrogated by you.
JACOB: Well leave then. Go to Hell.
JEZZIE: You son-of-a-bitch. Who do you think you are? I don't deserve this. Who takes care of you day and night? Who cleans the floor and washes your goddamn underwear? Well, I've had it. You flip out on your own, you ungrateful bastard. I'm done holding your hand. I don't want anything to do with you, you hear? Nothing!
