Applying Simple Linear Regression Model on Time Series I have a dataframe for two variables for a period of 22 years. The independent variable refers to the GDP per capita while the independent variable refers to Gross Debt per capita. I'm trying to build a model to analyse the relationship between the two variables using the simple linear model. I was wondering if I should make the variables stationary before fitting the model. And if so, what would be the appropriate function in R that can apply 'lm' on time series object? I got a bit confused as I saw some books and tutorials for regressing economic indicators (with time intervals) where the the independent and dependant variables were not tested against stationarity assumption before building the model. Are there any insights in this regard?
