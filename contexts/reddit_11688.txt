The roads are bad and I haven't heard from my boyfriend yet. I'm so worried.
I'm not really sure where to put all these nervous feelings and this just seemed like the right place.

I live in Canada, it's cold, and the roads are sheet ice tonight. I was having a terrible evening. My boyfriend got off work at about 10, and called me, only to listen to me cry and complain that I'm having a hard time. He calmed me down a little, and then said he wanted to make my night better. He said he'd call me when he got home from work so I could vent. Exchanged "I love you"s, and hung up. He only lives about 10-15 minutes away from his work so I knew I could expect a call fairly soon. It's been two hours and I haven't heard from him. His phone is going to voice mail, and he's not answering texts. I feel like if something happened to him his family would let me know, but I'm so scared nonetheless. Car accidents are always happening this time of year and I'm just so scared.
