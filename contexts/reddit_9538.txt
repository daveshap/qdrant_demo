Feeling like an adult - just bought life insurance
I just purchased disability insurance, critical Illness insurance and life insurance. After a life of poverty and struggling I feel like an adult now. We are finally getting on our feet and it feels so nice to have a peace of mind if something happens.

Right now since we are young (30) the disability and CI insurance is more valuable to us than the life insurance.  If we fall Ill or become disabled we can draw from that. The one I picked we would get $1400/month if that were to happen.

Overall - I feel amazing. I'm happy to know if something happens my family is safe. Without my boyfriend income we would be screwed without my child care/cooking/cleaning etc we would be screwed. 

We surpassed our first goal - save 1k - then our second goal save 2k - we're on the third goal now. Honestly I feel safer as a result of getting insurance over having savings.  

It was a fraction of the cost too. They can work with your budget. We were comfortable with $200/month total - for $500 000 policy.  They say 10x your income is standard. We will re-evaluate when we have more debt/assets.  Right now I have 0 debt and 1 asset so 500k is fine. 

Anyone looking into getting it **do it** I highly recommend. It may be cheaper than you think!

Edit: Sorry all - to clarify my breakdown goes like this :

$50/month for life insurance,  CI & disability 
$50/month into tax free savings
X 2 for two people = $200/month
I have the kind that you can borrow against down the road. 

We have 0 debt so $500k is fine for us. We will re-evaluate when we have more assets and debt.

Our critical Illness and disability insurance is more valuable to us because we're still young.

Second edit: we're both smokers. I guess that's pretty important to know lol my bad

Third edit since I'm seeing a lot of questions about it: we have term insurance. We will reevaluate later on down the road.
