HARDEMEYER: Can I help you?
VENKMAN: Yeah, you can get your hand off my chest.
HARDEMEYER: I'm Jack Hardemeyer. I'm the mayor's assistant. What can I do for you?
VENKMAN: I'm an old friend of the mayor's. I just want to say hello to him.
HARDEMEYER: I know who you are, Doctor Venkman. Busting any ghosts lately?
VENKMAN: No, that's what I want to talk to the mayor about. We did a little job for the city a while back and we ended up getting sued, screwed and tattooed by deskworms like you.
HARDEMEYER: Look, you stay away from the mayor. Next fall, barring a disaster, he's going to be elected governor of this state and the last thing we need is for him to be associated with two-bit frauds and publicity hounds like you and your friends. You read me?
