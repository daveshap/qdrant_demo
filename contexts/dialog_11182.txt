LUCY: What the hell are you doing?
AUDREY: Remember my friend we saw on t.v.?
LUCY: Your old sweetheart?
AUDREY: Yeah, well he just turned up in New Jersey at the military command post. Somehow all this is related to what happened down in Panama. There's a story here. I know it. You got any tape or glue?
LUCY: I left my forgery kit back at the office.
AUDREY: Hey, do you have any glue in your bag?
KID: What's it to you?
AUDREY: Can I use some?
KID: What do I get?
AUDREY: The warm feeling of helping your fellow man.
KID: Five bucks.
AUDREY: You're kidding, right?
