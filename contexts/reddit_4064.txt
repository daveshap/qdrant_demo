You have no right to complain about being single/people being shallow if your dating profile is full of old/misleading pics
It's hilarious how often this happens with both girls and guys. You match with someone on whatever app/site you're using, agree to meet up, and then they show up looking little like the actual person you matched with. Then you realize they've been using pics from years ago, pics that have been angled/filtered a certain way, etc

I've seen so many of these people complain that there's unfair standards, that everyone else is shallow and places too much emphasis on looks, whatever. And they're completely missing the point: you being 20 pounds heavier than in the past isn't the issue, it's the fact that you had to lie and deceive someone into meeting you that's the problem. It also screams insecurity. If you're lying from the get-go the relationship, assuming it happens, will be toxic. Unless the other person is desperate and happy with anyone

Worried that people won't be attracted to you because you've gained weight? Stop manipulating them on your profile and put that effort into actually going to the gym and eating healthier. Until then, don't complain that nobody wants to date you. It's your own doing
