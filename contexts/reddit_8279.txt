What public evidence do we have about the perpetrators and motivations behind the attacks in the Gulf of Oman?
Two oil tankers have been attacked in the Gulf of Oman. [The US have accused Iran of the attacks, which Iran dispute](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-48630374).

In the mean time, [the UK have joined the US in this accusation](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/14/us-accuses-iran-of-detaining-crew-after-oil-tanker-attack)... except for Jeremy Corbyn who has questioned whether there is [credible evidence](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-48645280).

What is the evidence to support and contradict the accusation that Iran is responsible for the attacks? Is there any evidence that the attack was perpetrated by, or within the capabilities of, another party? Regardless of who was responsible, for what reasons would someone want to attack commercial shipping in this area?
