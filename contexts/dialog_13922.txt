CLAUDIA: You want me to be your daughter forever, don't you?
LOUIS: Yes.
CLAUDIA: Well tell me, papa. What was it like making love?

LOUIS: It was something hurries...and seldom savoured... something acute that was quickly lost. It was the pale shadow of killing.
CLAUDIA: But how will I ever know, Louis?
