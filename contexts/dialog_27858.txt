HAGEN: Kay, we weren't expecting you. You should call...
KAY: I've tried calling and writing. I want to reach Michael.
HAGEN: Nobody knows where he is. We know he's all right, but that's all.
KAY: What was that?
HAGEN: An accident. No one was hurt.
KAY: Listen Tom, I let my cab go; can I come in to call another one?
