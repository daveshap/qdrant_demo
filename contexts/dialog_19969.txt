ROSA: I got this apartment with a guy.
BETTY: The one you were telling me about?
ROSA: No, this one was worse... I had to have the place sprayed when he left. Twice... He was two guys before the last one -- not counting a little office thing in there, which I'm trusting you with, 'cause if it gets out, I'm on the street...
BETTY: It's lovely... I really like your aquarium.
ROSA: Yeah, well, at least fish don't use your razor or pee on the seat...
BETTY: Hmmm. Sounds like you've had a pretty tough go of it with men...
ROSA: Oh, I dunno... but just once I wish I'd run into a guy who noticed the Koi before my tits.
