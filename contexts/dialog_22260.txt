CLEANER: Yo, pal, what's with you -- The place ain't operatin'.
ROCKY: Listen, I gotta problem. This girl ain't feelin' well, y'know -- The doctor says she should exercise, y'know once in awhile an' ice skatin' is the best thing --
CLEANER: This a con?
ROCKY: Look at her, ya can see she ain't feelin' good -- needs a few minutes exercise --
CLEANER: Few minutes?
ROCKY: ...Ten minutes.
CLEANER: Ten minutes for ten dollars.
ROCKY: ...Yeah, give 'er the Blades.
ADRIAN: ...Aren't you skating?
ROCKY: Ain't skated since I was fifteen -- That's when I started fightin' -- gotta watch the ankles. Yeah, fightin' use to be tops with me, but no more. All I wanted to prove was I weren't no bum -- That I had the stuff to make a good pro.
ADRIAN: And you never got the chance?
CLEANER: Nine minutes!
ROCKY: Hey, I ain't cryin'... I still fight. Kinda do it like a hobby. See I'm a natural southpaw an' most pugs won't fight a southpaw 'cause we mess up their timin' an' look awkward -- Southpaw means lefthanded... But I guess in the long run things probably worked out for the best, right?
ADRIAN: But you never had a chance to prove yourself.
ROCKY: Absolutely.
