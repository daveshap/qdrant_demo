CLAREMONT: <i>Well... I think that these are the gentlemen who robbed us. I'm also a bail bondsman out of Los Angeles. I can track down and deliver these crooks to you... for a small finder's fee of course.</i>
BISHOP: How much?
CLAREMONT: <i>$300,000.</i>
BISHOP: And if you can't deliver them?
CLAREMONT: <i>My theft insurance policy will have to fork over the ten million... but that will take six to eight months due to Nevada state law.</i> <i>But you should know sir... that I employ bounty hunters. My bounty hunters can find these thieves.</i>
