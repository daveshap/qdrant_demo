I’ve just gone 1.5 months without an anxiety attack!
I haven’t had one since January. Although I had one tonight, I’m glad that I made it this far because it used to be worse. Before, I was getting them a few times per week and it was quite debilitating. I still have work to do. I had one because it was over a topic that I haven’t covered in therapy yet. However, I’m just glad that I’ve made this accomplishment. 

To anyone that struggles, (this is really cliche) it does get better over time. It may not feel like you’re going anywhere, but I can guarantee that you are. Whether it be a small accomplishment or large, progress is being made.
