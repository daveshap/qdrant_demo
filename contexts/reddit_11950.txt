Just A Downswing
Things have been going okay.  I've got my head in a couple projects, got my scooters to fix, kids to play with, day job, friends.  There's a new girl I have a crush on, lots of events coming up.

But today, I broke down and thought of you.

I watched that damn Story Corps thing with Annie and Danny, and someone posted about the first few minutes of UP and now I can't stop thinking about you and missing you.  It's been almost 3 months.  Each day is different, most days lately I'm fine.  Today is not one and I know I'm going to spend the rest of today trying to play mind games online.  I really do want to be your friend, I really want to stay in touch.  I really want you to live your life and be happy.  I just wish it was with me.

Now I have to get back to being okay and being on my own.  I can't write you, can't text you.  My friends are tired of hearing about this.  So I'm writing here just to get it out of my head.  Hopefully I can focus and not break down at work.

I'm having such a hard time letting you go, and I don't know why.  You're so much younger, you're so far away, we're going different directions.  And yet you linger in my head.  We were going to be married, we were going to live a blissfully geeky life and now we aren't and the hole is just too big to fill back in with my own life.

Today is just a bad day.
