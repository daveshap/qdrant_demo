NYC security guard license
My license expires at the end of this month. I cannot find a single place offering 8 hour annual classes which I need to renew. Online I read that any license issued by the state of New York with an expiration date past March something is valid until about June 7th. And that date might get extended also. Not sure if that applies to this license. Anyone have any info on this?
