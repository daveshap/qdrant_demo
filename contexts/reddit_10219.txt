Do you guys ever feel so horribly alone even when you're around close friends or family?
I feel like nobody gets it, life feels so fake and plasticy. How does everybody do this day in day out?? It's been one tragedy after another for my whole life, out of 18 years only 6 months felt real and happy. I cling to that time in memory hoping I get to relive it. I took such advantage of it.

The only enjoyment I get out of life is talking to my crush and my dad. I want to see them happy. They're the only important things to me.

Is making others happy really all I exist for? I want to die so badly but it would hurt them. I hate it I wish they hated me so I could have an excuse. Thanks for reading my idiotic rambling. <3 you guys too.
