EDDIE: Why didn't you tell us about these guys, Ian?!
MALCOLM: Because I didn't know! I don't have the faintest idea what they're doing here.
NICK: Ruining everything, that's what they're doing. You could choke on the diesel smoke already!
SARAH: Ian, nothing we observe will be valid if we're trailing along in the wake of an army.
KELLY: InGen." What's InGen?"
MALCOLM: Where does it say that?
KELLY: On the side of that one truck.
JUTTSON: InGen is a genetics corporation, isn't it?
NICK: Is that who we're really working for?! Gene splicers?!
MALCOLM: No! We're an independently funded expedition.
SARAH: Funded by whom?
MALCOLM: John Hammond.
JUTTSON: But he's the head of InGen!
NICK: You gotta be kidding. You dragged me out of Greenpeace to be a corporate stooge? You couldn't get anybody else?
