NENA: You live like a pig.
BILLY-BOY: Can't you say something nice once?
NENA: Okay. It doesn't smell as bad in here as I remember it smelling.
KITTLE: Been waiting long?
NENA: Just got here.
KITTLE: How'd we do?
NENA: A.D. is a C.P.A.
KITTLE: Come again... ?
NENA: Archibald Dobbs; Certified Public Accountant. But, that's all we got.
KITTLE: Maybe it's enough.
BILLY-BOY: No offices are gonna be open today.
KITTLE: Lots of these pencil-pushers work out of their homes. It's a tax dodge.
NENA: Bad news is, word's spreading like wildfire that we don't have badges, and nobody wants to end up getting splattered like Butch Cassidy either.
BILLY-BOY: If we don't catch a break soon, we're gonna be left standing with our dicks in our hands.
NENA: Speak for yourself.
