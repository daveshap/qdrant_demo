HUNSECKER: Susie, you're very much in my thoughts today.
SUSAN: Why?
HUNSECKER: What a question, dear, with that newspaper in your hand...
SUSAN: Did Sidney tell you about it?
HUNSECKER: Yes, he phoned. I don't know this boy too well. Anything in these charges?
HUNSECKER: Not being partial, are you?
SUSAN: No, I'm not. I'm not!
