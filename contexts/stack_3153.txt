60's or 70's monster movie whose victims are caught and wrapped in a cape or coat Just like the title says. I went to the movie with my sister when we were less than ten years old... It was a double matinee with The Green Slime playing as well. All I can remember is this person whose face was obscured and had a long dark coat or cape on. He would slowly come up behind the victims and wrap them in it... It was really creepy. Any help would be great.
