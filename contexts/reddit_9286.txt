Have you ever used a food bank? I feel like both a failure and a cheat after visiting one today.
I feel like a cheat because I did have money in the bank but it is money I need to pay my car insurance next month and if I spend it I won’t be able to save enough in time.  Actually, the food bank I used does huge hampers for $50, so I did actually use some of it to get food. I also had to buy a new battery for my car yesterday as it wouldn’t start. Now I have just enough to pay the insurance I hope. 

Food costs are astronomical here in regional Australia and while wages are generally good, we are a fairly low income family with a 7 year old child.  I manage bills by paying them each fortnight (or putting money aside each fortnight) but my husbands pay can go up or down by about $400 depending on how many hours and penalty rates he gets. Sometimes after rent and bills there’s no money for food and now we have credit card debt.

EDIT thank you to all the wonderful people who’ve made me feel better about my choice. I will look into volunteering with them, I volunteer at an op shop (a thrift shop) as well. Hopefully that kinda balances out my karma a little.
