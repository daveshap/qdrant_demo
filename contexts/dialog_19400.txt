KARLA: What are you doing here?
CRAIG: I hope you don't think I'm crazy, but I just had to come in here and show you I ain't scared of yo' punk ass brothers...and you wouldn't have be scared of 'em neither if you had a man like me in yo' life.
KARLA: What?? So you snuck in my room to tell me that?
CRAIG: Yes I did. Excuse me.
