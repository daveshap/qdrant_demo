life in general
I grew up being told to get a career, focus on school don't worry about boys, there will be plenty of time for that later. Now it's later I'm 36 single, with a law degree and massive loans in a job I hate and now realizing I'm never going to get married and have children which at this point is all I want to do.  I look around at friends and family who "screwed up" got knocked up and they are all happy.
