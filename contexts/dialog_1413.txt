JIM: Why, yeah.
LYLA: I hope you don't mind, Jesse James told me your name.
JIM: Oh, you were talking to Jesse.
LYLA: Yes, but just so I could find out who you were.
JIM: Really?
LYLA: I hope I'm not being too forward.
JIM: Not at all.
LYLA: I just though you were awful cute.
JIM: Thank you, Miss -- ?
LYLA: Lyla Devereux.
JIM: Gosh, that's a pretty name. Buy you a drink?
LYLA: Could we go upstairs and talk? It's so loud down here.
JIM: Why don't we get a bottle of sherry to sip while we talk?
LYLA: That is so gentlemanly of you.
JIM: Devereux. My brother Cole dated a European girl once.
LYLA: Really?
JIM: Don't talk about it much, though.
PARKER: The final route for the railroad is complete.

RAINS: That.
PARKER: Oh, that. I'll let Jenkins explain.
