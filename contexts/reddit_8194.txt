Australia hasn't experienced in a recession in 25 years. In terms of policy, what are they doing right? Can it last?
The Economist [recently reported on](http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2017/03/economist-explains-11) Australia's recent macroeconomic history, noting that the nation hasn't experienced a recession (*[a significant decline in activity across the economy, lasting longer than a few months](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/recession.asp)*) in over 25 years. Compare this to the average rate in the US, [which is](http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/071315/what-average-length-boom-and-bust-cycle-us-economy.asp) about three years. 

Some [have cited](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/25/business/international/australia-china-mining-port-hedland.html?_r=0) China's rise and demand for Australian goods as a causal factor independent of Australian economic policy. Others [have credited](https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2016/mar/03/three-reasons-australias-economy-is-so-resilient-shopping-housing-and-yes-mining) other industries and prudent government policies.

What is Australia doing right? What can its success teach the rest of the world?
