Does the 2017 repeal of the individual mandate invalidate the ACA and, if so, how?
I searched the sub but didn’t find anything concerning the 2017 ruling.  I apologize if I indeed overlooked it. 


Thursday night the Trump administration joined Texas and 17 other states in asking the US Supreme Court to [overturn the Affordable Care Act.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/politics/obamacare-trump-administration-supreme-court.html?referringSource=articleShare).  


From the article: “In his brief, Solicitor General Noel J. Francisco argued that the health law’s two remaining central provisions are now invalid because Congress intended that all three work together.”


After searching for provisions in the ACA, there appears to be quite a lot, so I’m confused as to the “three” the SG is referring to and, additionally, how each relies on the other.
