FRAN: Oh, yes -- office party -- Miss Olsen --
BUD: That's right. I told you we had a fight -- that's what it was about -- Miss Olsen -- you know that other girl you saw --
FRAN: I don't understand --
BUD: It's not important, Fran -- the main thing is that I got here in time -- and you're going to be all right -- -- isn't she, Doc?
FRAN: I'm so tired -- DR. DREYFUSS Here -- drink this.
FRAN: Please -- just let me sleep.
DR. DREYFUSS: You can't sleep. Come on, Fran -- open your eyes. Let's get her walking. We've got to keep her awake for the next couple of hours.
