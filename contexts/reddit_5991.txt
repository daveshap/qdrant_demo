Stuck between college courses, do I do the one that I think I will enjoy more or the one that will give me (in my opinion) a more secure job?
I have two college courses lined up, one is in Sports and fitness, which I wanted to do, and one in Electrical Engineering. Now I wanted to study sports and fitness as I believed this would be more pleasant and enjoyable but now I’m starting to reconsider as I am thinking that I may get a better job and degree if I went down the electrical engineering path. Just looking for any advice I’m pretty stuck
