Buck Boost Battery 3.6V (Lithium-thionyl Chloride) to 5V I hope this question has not been asked and it's not as far as I have seen.I am developing an IoT project which uses almost no current (&lt; 100uA) when sleeping and up to 80mA when running. The problem is I need to power this with a battery which has to last quite a long time (1-2 years) and it doesn't have to be rechargeable. In particular I have found Lithium-thionyl Chloride to be pretty good at this and usually have a voltage of 3.6V at full charge. My project runs on an ARM processor and the whole system works with an input from 3.6V to 6V and I'd like to input 5V. So I need to use a very efficient buck boost converter to go from 2/3.6V to 5V. This is how I am thinking to go about it.If anyone knows a better way to power up this type of system I'd appreciate suggestions.I'd prefer buying the complete circuit/product instead of building it but I can't find a good one on eBay. I can build one but I would really like to do that only in the worst case scenario.Does anyone here know how to move about this?Thanks everyone.
