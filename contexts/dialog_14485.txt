BRODY: I'd like to tell you what we're doing so far. These are some of the steps I've taken as Chief of Police...
MEADOWS: What's going on with the beaches, Chief?
BRODY: I'll get to that in a minute. First, I plan to start our seasonal summer help early, and to use shark spotters on beaches open to the sea. I'd like cooperation from local fishermen, and I've also contacted the Oceanographic Institute over on the mainland.
VAUGHN: No need to involve outsiders in our business, Martin.
