GITTES: I got your check in the mall.
EVELYN: Yes. As I said, I was very grateful.
GITTES: Mrs. Mulwray, I'm afraid that's not good enough.
EVELYN: Well, how much would you like?
GITTES: Stop it. The money's fine. It's generous but you've shortchanged me on the story.
EVELYN: I have?
GITTES: I think so. Something besides your husband's death was bothering you. You were upset but not that upset.
EVELYN: Mr. Gittes... Don't tell me how I feel.
GITTES: Sorry. Look, you sue me, your husband dies, you drop the lawsuit like a hot potato, and all of it quicker than wind from a duck's ass. Excuse me. Then you ask me to lie to the police.
EVELYN: It wasn't much of a lie.
GITTES: If your husband was killed it was. This can look like you paid me off to withhold evidence.
EVELYN: But he wasn't killed.
