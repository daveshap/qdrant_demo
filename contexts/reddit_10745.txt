I am a ghost
I deleted everything. This is the only social media I'm still active on. Everything else is gone. I cut all ties. I haven't talked to freinds in days. I feel completely invisible. But I like it this way. I no longer have to make an ass of myself in front of loved ones. Maybe this is a better alternative to suicide... or maybe the first step.
