ZACK: Yes, sir!
FOLEY: Maybe there's hope for you yet.
PERRYMAN: I see you didn't DOR, Mayo.
ZACK: Hey, Sid, thanks.
ZACK: Hey, you guys still awake?

ZACK: Hey, do you guys ever... feel like you don't belong here...?
PERRYMAN: Yeah. All week long.
SID: What's the matter, Sweet Pea. Foley finally starting to get to you?
ZACK: Naw.
