I hate people who say suicidal people are selfish.
This life is my own and mine alone. Do not tell me what to do with it. I am not going to keep living in pain and misery, just so the people around me don't feel sad. I'm sorry, it's possible that some people will be heavily affected by my death, but I don't care enough to keep going. 

Fuck you \[person\] for telling me that suicidal people are selfish and are sinners. Fuck you to hell and back.
