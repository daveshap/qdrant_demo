What are the pros and cons of ethanol subsidies and mandates?
[Ethanol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol) is a plant-derived alcohol that's used, among other things, as a biofuel.

In the United States, the government [subsidizes the production of ethanol and mandates its mixture with gasoline to varying degrees.](https://www.thoughtco.com/understanding-the-ethanol-subsidy-3321701)

Using ethanol in this way has its [pros and cons,](https://www.thebalance.com/the-pros-and-cons-of-ethanol-809300) both environmentally and economically.

I'm interested in knowing how those pros and cons play into the policy decision to subsidize ethanol production and mandate its use.
