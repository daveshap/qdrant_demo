One of my favorite phrases my therapist told me to keep in mind when I start to feel anxious...
He said, “you want to notice your thoughts as they float down the river of your mind, without getting swept away by them.”

Just “noticing” my anxious thoughts, not entertaining them nor judging or analyzing them helps me to de-escalate my worries before they turn into a full blown panic attack. 

I hope this helps in some way.
