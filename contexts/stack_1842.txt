Definite articles before abstract nouns which don't relate to any (very) particular instances I know that the title may be little misleading but here is the example which bothers me.<blockquote>  New approach to (the) ellipticity of linear differential operators</blockquote>On contrary, I am sure that the following are correct<blockquote>  It follows from the ellipticity of the Laplace operator. (specified abstract noun)    Ellipticity is closely related to hyperbolicity. (just abstract nouns)</blockquote>Similarly, I am not sure how to write the following sentence<blockquote>  I still believe in (the) kindness of people.</blockquote>Where the following ones are obvious.<blockquote>  Kindness must be sustained. (specified abstract noun)    The kindness of John is beyond all norms. (just an abstract noun)</blockquote>Thus, Here is my actual question eventually.Question. Am I specifying abstract nouns in my examples and I should use \"the\" or is my specification artificial and I should omit \"the\"?
