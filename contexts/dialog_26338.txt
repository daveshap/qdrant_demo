ETHAN: You think so?
SUPERGIRL: I don't see why not.
ETHAN: But what if---it wasn't real?
SUPERGIRL: Feelings are real. Once you've had them, they're yours forever.
ETHAN: Hey, listen, when all this blows over, maybe we could get together every now and then and see each other. And maybe something might. happen again. What do you think?
SUPERGIRL: Are you asking me for a date"?"
ETHAN: Why not? You're a good-looking girl. And I'm--- available.
SUPERGIRL: Aren't you forgetting about Selena?
ETHAN: She'll forget about us eventually.
SUPERGIRL: There's something very dangerous about her. Something evil...
ETHAN: I know what it is. She has this lead container shaped like a gargoyle. Inside there's a silvery ring...
SUPERGIRL: That's the Power Source that was lost from Argo City! That's what I came: to find! Where does she live?
ETHAN: In this big old house on Orchard Avenue---but you better stay away from there.
SUPERGIRL: I can see through walls. I could surprise her. The only thing I can't see through is lead, that's why I didn't see the Power Source at the amusement park.
ETHAN: Wait. Don't leave me.
SUPERGIRL: You'll be safe here. I'll come back as soon as I have the Power Source.
ETHAN: Before you go...
SUPERGIRL: What?
ETHAN: Just one kiss. For old times' sake.
SUPERGIRL: And you can see how you feel about me, right?
ETHAN: Yes.
