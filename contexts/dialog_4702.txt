LEADER: Someone dead from this household?
ARGYLE: We just had a funeral, isn't that what it means in England as well?
LEADER: What it means in England -- and in Scotland too -- is that rebels have forfeited their lands. We were ambushed last night. But the Scots dragged their dead away.
ARGYLE: My brother and nephew perished two days ago, when their hay cart turned over.
LEADER: Then we'll just have a peek at the wounds. Dig 'em up!
ARGYLE: They've been sanctified and buried in the holy rites of God's church, and any hand that disturbs them now takes on eternal damnation. So please -- do it.
