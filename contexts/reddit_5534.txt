My brother is good at chess and games. What job could suit his skills?
I am very concerned about my brother's [22 M] future, as he is a talented young man, but young and stupid. When I was his age, I could have used advice to take me in the right direction, without wasting years of confused time. He has the same stupid notions as I had about "scores not defining the future, degree isn't valuable, etc ". But, now I realize that it is never a bad idea to do well in college, especially if your passion and talent isn't in something unrelated to academics, like sports or art.

My brother isn't exceptionally passionate about any form of art. He loves music, but never showed an interest in pursuing it as a career. He is also generally introverted, but exudes personality in any setting, thinks beyond his years, but lacks the vigor and drive to make things happen. He also doesn't put too much effort into studies, until it's last minute. I think he can do really well if he does. What he lacks is a goal to work towards.

Now to his positives: He has always been exceptionally good at reaching jaw dropping levels in games, and he's been really good at chess. He is also physically fit, and has all the determination to push himself to the limits. I've thought that the navy or army would suit him. 

Does anybody have any kind of advice to offer in his regards? What could suit his skills the best, to which I encourage him to put his efforts to succeed?

TL;Dr: My brother is talented and sensible, but young and goalless. He's good at games, chess, and physical training from my observations, but hasn't done too well in academics. What he lacks is a goal to work towards that can set him in the right direction. Any advice? 

Thanks in advance.
