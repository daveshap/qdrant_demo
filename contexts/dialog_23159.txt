VOICE: You almost sound like that guy from THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT CARRIE. Ben. Ben Damon.
BEN: Well ya got me. That's me. I'm Ben Damon.
VOICE: Really? You're such a talented actor.
BEN: Thanks.
VOICE: Now let's see you act your way out of this one.
BEN: What do you mean?
VOICE: I mean, I'm standing right outside the LADIES ROOM door at the PLAZA THEATER. Your girlfriend Christine is in there. She's all alone. Everyone's in the auditorium waiting for the film to start. I've got my knife.
BEN: Listen you sick fuck, is this your idea of a joke?
VOICE: More of a game really.
BEN: What kind of a game?
VOICE: You seem to be familiar with the STAB movies. Here's how we play. I ask you a question. You get it right, your girlfriend lives. You answer wrong, she dies.
BEN: I swear to God if you lay a finger on her I'll fucking kill you!
VOICE: Maybe so, but right now, we play the game. First question, Your girlfriend's counting on you, Name your girlfriend's character in STAB 2?
