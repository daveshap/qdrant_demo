I didn't get the job
I'm not surprised, but I wasted a whole paycheck to go out there and interview with them. I'm a horrible speaker, and no one really likes me any way, but they seemed nice enough and seemed willing to work with me. 

I didn't even notice the email until today, so I can't exactly do anything about it. So that's what's bothering me. I'm really considering leaving the field I'm in anyway.
