How are stateless firewalls useful in public cloud platforms? I'm trying to understand the value of stateless firewalls in public cloud platforms like Network Access Control Lists (NACL) in Amazon Web Services (AWS). I think I know a few ways I can use them, but I'm not sure about the actual value in terms of security.AWS already has security groups - which are stateful - with which I can restrict what source CIDR can access what port in a compute instance. I know NACL can be used to secure an entire subnet. Apart from sheer convenience, is there any other valid use case for stateless firewalls in cloud platforms that can't be achieved with stateful firewalls like Security Groups. This question arose because I found that Google Cloud Platform and Azure Cloud don't seem to have stateless firewall services. GCP has cloud armor security policies which look similar to AWS NACL but they seem to apply only to HTTP load balancers.
