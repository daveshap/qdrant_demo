Questions for people with good jobs but no college or university education.
I am a sixteen-year-old in Ontario who is doing absolutely horrible in high school. All my marks are way below average because I don't really put in the effort. I am a hard worker and I am usually dedicated to things I enjoy, especially when money is involved.

I don't know what I want to do with my life, and I don't know where I want to go from here. I just need to hear other people's stories.

For the people out there with no college or university education, or may have dropped out of college or university; have any of you got well-paid jobs? Have you guys or girls bought a house, are living comfortably, enjoy your job?
