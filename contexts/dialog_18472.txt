LONGFELLOW: Please!
WALTER: But how'll I put on the slipper, sir?
WALTER: Yes, sir. I beg pardon, sir, but did you ever find what you were looking for, sir?
LONGFELLOW: Looking for?
WALTER: You kept searching me last night, sir. Going through my pockets. You said you were looking for a rhyme for Budington.
LONGFELLOW: Better bring me some coffee, Walter.
WALTER: Very good, sir. Oh, I beg pardon. A telegram came for you, sir. I'll get you some black coffee, sir.
COBB: Did you see all this stuff in the papers?
LONGFELLOW: Arthur wants to quit!
COBB: Arthur! Who's Arthur?
LONGFELLOW: He's the shipping clerk at the Tallow Works. Wants a $2 raise - or he'll quit.
COBB: What do I care about Arthur! Did you see this stuff in the paper? How'd it get in there? What'd you do last night? Who were you talking to?
COBB: And what'd you do to those bodyguards? They quit this morning. Said you locked them up.
LONGFELLOW: Oh, they insisted on following me.
COBB: What do you think bodyguards are for?
LONGFELLOW: What do they mean by this - Cinderella Man!""
COBB: Are those stories true?
LONGFELLOW: I don't remember. Cinderella Man!" What do they mean by that?"
COBB: They'd call you anything if you gave them half a chance. They've got you down as a sap.
LONGFELLOW: I think I'll go down and punch this editor on the nose.
COBB: No, you don't! Get this clear: Socking people is no solution for anything.
LONGFELLOW: Sometimes it's the only solution.
COBB: Not editors. Take my word for it. Not editors!
LONGFELLOW: If they're going to poke fun at me, I'm going toâ€”
COBB: Listen. Listen, Longfellow. You've got brains, kid. You'll get along swell if you'll only curb your homicidal instincts - and keep your trap shut. Don't talk to anybody! These newshounds are out gunning for you.
LONGFELLOW: But what about this Cinderella Man"?"
COBB: That's my job. I'll take care of that. I'll keep that stuff out of the papers - if you'll help me. But I can't do anything if you go around talking to people. Will you promise me to be careful from now on?
LONGFELLOW: Yes, I guess I'll have to.
COBB: Thank you. If you feel the building rock, it'll be me blasting into this editor.
LONGFELLOW: Cobb's right. I mustn't talk to anybody.
BUTLER: Miss Dawson on the phone, sir.
LONGFELLOW: Who? Miss Dawson?
BUTLER: Yes, sir.
LONGFELLOW: Fine. I'll talk to her. Give me the phone, quick. She's the only one I'm going to talk to from now on.
LONGFELLOW: It's awfully nice of you to show me around like this.
BABE: I enjoy it.
LONGFELLOW: The Aquarium was swell. If I lived in New York, I'd go there every day. I'll bet you do.
BABE: Well, I'd like to - but I have a job to think of.
