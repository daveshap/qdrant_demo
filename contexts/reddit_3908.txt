If women never initiate conversations with you, does it mean you're facially unfortunate?
22 year old virgin guy here. I have never in my life had a women start a conversation with me, unless it was a waitress asking me what I'd like to order. And even when I do initiate, I get one word answers and they walk off. Along with getting zero matches and replies on dating sites, is it safe for me to assume that I'm unattractive?
