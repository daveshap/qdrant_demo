How on earth do people afford down payments and closing costs for even moderately priced homes?
Anyone here who owns a home, please share how you managed it. After looking at my own low finances and all of the costs I’m seeing being thrown for buying a house, I can’t fathom how people on low incomes can do this. Any advice is appreciated.
