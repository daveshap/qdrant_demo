How much do you budget per month for food?
I'm starting grad school this fall, full-time on an assistantship (after several years working full-time), so my income will be considerably lower. Rent will eat up a chunk of my pay, so I'm trying to get an idea now of how much I should be budgeting for everything. I don't live a lavish lifestyle or anything close to it, don't eat out much, not a partier/drinker, etc

Just trying to get an idea of how other people budget. Any advice is welcome
