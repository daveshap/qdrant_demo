What are my chances? What Can I do?
Hello All

My path to student affairs has been a very rough one and I just need some other opinions. 

I am a 22 year old LatinX Male who is low income, has a bachelors degree in history. My ending GPA from undergrad ended as a 2.63. I had a very below average score for my GRE. I can afford to retake it and I can't afford to go to a Community College to improve my GPA. I decided to take a year off to work in Americorps because I couldn't initially get in to grad school for student affairs. I legitimately want to know what are my chances of getting into a grad school? AS well as, what can I do to improve me and my chances for the better?
