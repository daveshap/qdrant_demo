ALAN: Good.
EDGAR: That's just the way we like it.
SAM: Grandpa, the Widow Johnson called. She said to pick her up a seven instead of eight.
GRANDPA: Did we have a date tonight?
SAM: I guess so. She said not to be late.
GRANDPA: I better get cleaned up, then.
STAR: They'll be coming for Laddie and me, won't they?
MICHAEL: They'll be coming for <u>all</u> of us.
MAX: Maybe this is the night where everything finally goes right for a change.
LUCY: I hope so.
MAX: Something the matter?
LUCY: No, no. Just worrying about my boys -- as usual.
MAX: Let me tell you something about boys. They're like weeds. They grow best when they're ignored.
LUCY: I thought you said they needed discipline?
MAX: Well... what do I know? I'm a bachelor. Lucy... this is going to be a very special night, I promise you.
