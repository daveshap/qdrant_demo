NEBBLEMAN: What did security say?
SUSAN: They'll in validate the key. Probably nothing.
NEBBLEMAN: Well, you got another problem.
SUSAN: The replicators?
NEBBLEMAN: Worse. Mrs. Argon wants to talk to you. She's waiting in the lab.
SUSAN: This day just keeps going from bad to worse.
POPPY: Vermin...
SUSAN: Can I help you, Mrs. Argon?
POPPY: I spoke to Dr. Argon this morning and he remains frustrated over the loss of the original nanobot.
SUSAN: I am aware of Dr. Argon's frustrations.
POPPY: He believes that the second nanobot should be ready for testing by now.
