Help
Im standing over my bathroom sink with a knife in my hand, crying and trying to hold on.  Ive dealt with depression since I was a young teenager, so its almost been half my life at this point.  Its ruined everything good that has happened to me in my life.. my friendships, athletics, interests, and my relationship with the love of my life. No one should have to live like this. Ive never been one to show emotion, but Ive cried my eyes out every single night for the past two weeks because things just keep getting worse. I don't see a way forward or a reason to keep fighting.  I need help... please.
