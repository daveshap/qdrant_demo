This is going to get downvoted.
I know that I should be happy for people in my grade who are going to Harvard, Stanford. The Ivy leagues. t-10s.  I know how hard it is to get admission into these schools. I know that they worked hard to get into these schools. They deserved to get in.

I just can't help feeling that I worked hard too. I cried. I did the all nighters. I sacrificed. I did everything they did. I feel like all my hard work as gone to waste. I deserved to get in too. Sometimes I feel like I wasted the last four years of my life. People say "you can always get where you want to be, you just have to work hard." I did, though.. I worked. and I worked. and I worked.

I am going to a state school, which is 100% NOT BAD. I am happy that I even had an option, a thing that some don't have.

I know that one day I will get over it. I can get to the same place, someday. But, today, I am just miserable. I feel like I am nothing. I feel so bad about myself.
