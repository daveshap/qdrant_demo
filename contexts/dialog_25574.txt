HAN: No, it's impossible... No one, and I mean no one would venture anywhere near the Alderaan system... I'm a free booter, not revolutionary. You're aboard the wrong ship, son!
LUKE: Maybe the fact that no one would go there voluntarily could help us. They probably don't think anyone would dare try.
HAN: Don't you believe it.
BEN: Luke's got a point... ... Fear is their greatest defense... I doubt if the actual security there is much greater than on Aquilae or Sullust, and what there is is most likely directed toward large-scale assault.
HAN: This isn't a game, you know.
