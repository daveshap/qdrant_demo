You are somebody's every day
I need you to know that I'm genuinely rooting for your uplifting. Your spirit is something divine that can not be broken by self doubt, no matter how empty or dense you may feel. Your spirit lives forever, and I want to feel your spirit raise like a rainbow after a heavy rain, because I feel broken & dense myself. I want to rise with you.
