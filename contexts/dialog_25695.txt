ZANDER: I was thinking. Maybe we should get married, Carmen.
CARMEN: You weren't thinking...you were dreaming !

CARMEN: There's a war on. I want a command, I want my own ship, you do, too...
ZANDER: So ?
CARMEN: So who's got time to get married ?
ZANDER: Fleet encourages marriages among flight officers. You'd probably get a promotion out of it.
CARMEN: Funny...
ZANDER: I'm not kidding. Marriage is -
CARMEN: No, funny there's almost no wounded at all.
ZANDER: Hey, bugs don't take prisoners.
