\"Can\" or \"could\" in the mentioned sentence? <blockquote>  Could / Can Happiness bring pain?</blockquote>The above sentence is not meant to mean the past time. \"Could\and not \"can\is used for past. So, \"can\" is preferable in the sentence? On the other hand, the sentence is meant to ask whether there are possible conditions under which happiness bring pain. Or, does it ever happen that happiness brings pain. So, since it is about future possibility, isn't \"could\" a better choice?
