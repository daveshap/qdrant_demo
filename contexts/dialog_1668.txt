SALLY: Thank you, thank you, thank you.
CLAIR: My God, your wardrobe is incredible. It took me forever to decide. Oh, and I found Dr. X, thank you. You saved my life.
SALLY: Shit!
PANES: I'd cut off her red wine if I were you.
SALLY: Shit. It's my Galiano.
PANES: What does that mean?
SALLY: About five thousand dollars. With my discount.
GINA: Directing suits you.
JOE: I'm not so sure. Look again in three months.
GINA: It must be nice having so many strangers kiss your ass all of a sudden.
JOE: Ow! Gina, you obviously need to get fucked.
GINA: Just did. Jealous?
JOE: When does he graduate high school?
GINA: Oh, very jealous.
GINA: I saw Lucy when I was in London, she seems okay. It's hard to tell with her.
JOE: Shit, I forgot to call her back. She's off on a trip somewhere. Oh God, my grandad's flat in London's been sold.
GINA: In Cheyene Walk? Lucy's going to have a meltdown. Oh, I'm so sorry.
JOE: I should have damn well bought it. Well, we can't afford it. The movie's going to eat up a year of my life and I'm getting paid next to nothing. Do you know how much Skye Davidson's getting? Four million.
GINA: Yeah, but I hear she gives a mean blow job.
JOE: You really need to be fucked.
SALLY: So how are you really doing, Panes?
PANES: Why don't you go fuck yourself?
SALLY: No. Really. For real. Really.
PANES: I'm worried about your Galiano.
SALLY: You're a shit.
PANES: No, really, five thousand with your discount.
