DOUG: Hey, Lawrence how are you doing mate?
LAWRENCE: Doug, haven't seen you for a while.
DOUG: I've been around.
LAWRENCE: Have you met Holly? Josh's friend.
DOUG: No! Look Lawrence, I've taken over the lease on a theatre downtown and I'm throwing a party tomorrow night to show it off. It's going to be for alternative arts, but I need some help to finish it off, can you put the word out?
LAWRENCE: Sure. Excellent.
DOUG: Here's the details.
DOUG: I'll put one on the notice-board too.
HOLLY: Am I invited?
DOUG: Sure as long as you don't bring that prick Josh. Thanks Lawrence.
