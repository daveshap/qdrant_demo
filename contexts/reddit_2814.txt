What's a nice way to explain to potential employers that my previous boss abused and gaslit me?
I'm currently applying for a new job and their online form is asking why I left a certain job. Some of the highlights from this past job:

Immediately after signing me on, the boss said point blank I was under qualified but promised to give me formal training

He actually didn't provide any training and waited 8 months before telling me that I was crap at my job. He started verbally listing all the things I was doing wrong, the stupidest one being that I always played with my hair while working. Note that there was not a single complaint about my work up until this point. 

He said that he had written a list of things I needed to improve on. When I asked for the list, he refused and said that I needed to fix everything on my own.

Finally when he did provide me actual training, he brought in someone that worked from home due to chronic illness and fatigue. After each meeting when this employee was gone, my boss would pull me aside and berate me again for taking advantage of a sick employee. 

This along with several other issues left me so depressed an anxious that when he finally fired me I felt suicidal. 

Now as I fill out this new job application, I'm trying to figure out the nicest way to be honest. Anyone have any tips?
