I don’t meet the job requirements
So I have been just online applying to a whole bunch of companies. I finally got an interview for one and I went in yesterday. It went really well and a few hours later they offered me the job. I was ecstatic, as I need a source of income especially during this whole coronavirus pandemic. I gladly accepted and then decided to research a bit more about the company and found that they have a minimum age requirement that I don’t meet. I have no idea what to do. I surely don’t look very old but now I already accepted the offer. I’m only one year off from the age limit so does it really pose any problems? I researched everything else and in my state there isn’t anything prohibiting me from working as someone older would. I didn’t know where to post this but I really don’t know what to do.
