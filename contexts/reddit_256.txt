TLDR: My mom is a conspiracy theorist and wants to kick me out because I prefer science. (I’m 17 and she’s 55) Any advice on how to handle this?
My mom is the kind of woman who worships conspiracy theories like an obsession my friends had when we were all in the Creepypasta fandom; she believes everything is real. Here are a few things she believes. I want to stress that I don’t believe in any of this, I’m LGBT and I love studying science.  I believe that there could be other life out there, but I believe more in evolution and other sciences because of the amount of proof.
- aliens are helping to stop global warming 
- global warming doesn’t technically exist
- you shouldn’t punch nazis, even if they are nazis.
- all the royals and all billionaires are lizards and pedophiles.
- some kind of aliens wrote the bible to enslave humanity
- humans were all slaves
- evolution doesn’t exist.
- black lives matter shouldn’t be a thing 
- extreme weather is caused by aliens
- aliens literally control everything 
- all politicians but trump are pedophiles
- Trump is a good person 
-vaccines cause autism
- vaccines are killing people
- Trans people aren’t supported by science
- Tran women are men who need masculinity 

Anyways so I had a talk about a recent protest in having about the RCMP in my area dropping rape cases, and she immediately said that the royals that are moving to Canada are pedophiles and they are living with a pedophile.  That’s not what we were talking about, and I tried to steer back to the original topic, but she stayed on hers. She then brought up how climate change isn’t real, and since I’m learning about it in school, I showed her my notes and the scientific documents and proof I had from my lessons. She said human science is wrong, I called her crazy, and now she wants me to move out. She threatens me like this a lot, and it never actually happens, but I really want out.
I can’t trust anyone who lives near me enough to house me, and I go to college in September. Until then, I have no way out, and what’s worse is I started to believe what she was telling me until recently. I just hope I can make it until then,  because I really need to cut her off from my life.

Any advice on how to handle this?
