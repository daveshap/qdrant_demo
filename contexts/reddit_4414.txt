I am so full of jealousy and it’s eating me up :(
I’m starting to become really toxic, inside anyways, and it makes me unbelievably upset. Not only because I feel I’m so full of hate but because I know this isn’t me and I’m disappointed in myself. I miss a few years ago when I could just be happy for people, and not exclusively think about what I don’t have. It feels like it invades every part of my life. One example of this was how I couldn’t even be happy for my friend who’s talking to a girl right now, like I’m unbelievably upset at myself that I can’t even be happy for my own friend.
