Choice Anxiety: Dual Degree Program
I'm trying to figure out what to do, so consulting the hive mind.  


I'm starting an MS program in applied anthropology in the Fall. I have an option to enroll in a second degree program from another university partner for a MPH (public health). The options:  


1) enroll and begin dual-degree program concurrently, meaning two bureaucracies, two degrees at the end, but with around a 3 year complete time. This option is known for a lot of confusion/frustration plus a weekly 45 minute commute to another campus, and 12 credit hours per semester, will overlap with about 12 hours of my primary/first degree plan  


2) enroll in an online option that is 'carrousel' - flexible online 8-week courses that can be done part- or full-time, will overlap with 12 hours of degree plan, and must be completed within 6 years.  


I'm leaning towards the second option or none at all. For the second, I could conceivably complete only 4-6 classes and then get a certificate. It could be worth it- or it could make me miserable and throw a wrench in future plans for PhD. I may not stay in-state for 6 more years, either.  


What think ye?  


On a personal note, I work extremely hard, but I know I will be frustrated if the structure of the courses in conjunction prevents me from learning or doing my best work.
