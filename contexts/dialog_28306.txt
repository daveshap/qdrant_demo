HEALY: So, Dom tells me you're looking for some lady-friend you knew in high school.
TED: Uh-huh.
HEALY: Any idea where I might start looking?
TED: She moved to Miami Beach twelve years ago. I checked directory assistance down there and she's not listed. She might've moved ten times since then.
HEALY: All you want is a phone number?
TED: Well, I know you're busy...
HEALY: Don't play games with me, Ted.
TED: I don't know, maybe you could poke around for a half day and see if she has five kids and a Labrador.
HEALY: I don't buy it.
TED: You don't buy what?
HEALY: Ted, I'm the kind of guy who shoots from the hip. Now I want you to level with me: Did you knock this skirt up?
TED: No.
HEALY: She's blackmailing you, right?
TED: No.
HEALY: You want her dead, don't you?
TED: You can't be serious.
HEALY: Do you really expect me to believe this is a straight stalker case?
TED: I'm not a stalker! She's a friend of mine.
HEALY: Sure she is. That's why she got an unlisted number and you haven't heard squat from her in a dozen years. Oh you're good, Ted. You're a real piece of work.
TED: Look, let's forget it. Let's forget the whole thing.
HEALY: I get one hundred a day plus expenses.
TED: You get fifty a day, period. It's a business trip, they'll pay for your expenses.
