Whats a good "start over" job?
I'm 31m and have been managing finances for people who are mentally challenged.  Making sure their bills are paid, basic needs met, money each week for personal needs, and making sure everything is ok with their social security income.  I've had this job since immediately after high school.  I have no degree or any other work history.  The company i work for is being shut down.  I don't have a clue where to go other than home depot or wal mart.
