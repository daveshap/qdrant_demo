college withdrawals
i’m 19 and i’m currently taking two summer classes at my local community college. the first one is my english comp and the seconds my computers and programming class. my computers class is going great, i love the teacher and i enjoy going. my english class is a nightmare. my teacher hates me and i don’t do well with people not liking me, i can’t make friends they all seem to have something against me and kinda give me the cold shoulder. we also have 2 essays a week and it’s hard to keep a social life a job and the other classes work with this. i dread going to this class every day it gives me anxiety and i always feel like i’m gonna be sick before i go and i’ve skipped it multiple times for that reason. i really wish to withdraw and take the course again in the fall on a slower more steady paced course with a different teacher. does anyone think i would be okay if i did so? i’m worried my moms going to be mad but i don’t want to fail the course bc i dislike the teacher. please help.
