300 Job Applications Down And I’ve Finally Landed My First Job!
I don’t know who needs to hear this but here‘s a reminder to keep going if you’re job searching. This past year has been the toughest of my life and I have faced rejections from over 200 companies, the majority of which never even had the decency to get back to me. As I sent off my 300th job application, I wondered how long it would be before I was employed. As I was thinking that exact thought, a leading multinational company got back to me and offered me a job I had interviewed for.

The job search is brutal - companies are really shitty and it takes a lot to keep pushing through the rejections. My advice as someone who has finally made it through it all is to KEEP GOING. Your break is coming. Out of 300 job applications, one company saw something in me. If it’s attainable (which it is), it’s all a matter of time and effort to make it happen so keep going. You owe it to yourself.
