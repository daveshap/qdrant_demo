ENID: I'm going to this stupid art show and I want you to be my date... There's something I have to show you...
SEYMOUR: I... I don't know. I don't really think I should...
ENID: Of course you should. C'mon, I'm already a million hours late.
SEYMOUR: ...I better not...
ENID: Well forget the art show... let's do something else.
SEYMOUR: I... I wish I could, Enid, but I really can't right now... I -- it's just that I --
ENID: Well when can we do something?
SEYMOUR: It's just that, well, you know, Dana just got out of a really bad relationship and I don't want to give her the wrong idea... you know...
JOE: Don't mind me, I'll just be in my room.
ENID: Where did you get those pants?
SEYMOUR: Oh, uh... they were a present from Dana.
ENID: And you like them?
SEYMOUR: Well, you know... what do I know about clothes... I've never been the most fashionable guy -- it's nice to have someone do all the work for me...
ENID: So that's it? You don't ever want to see me again?
SEYMOUR: No, of course I do... It's just that right now I need to --
ENID: What's her problem anyway? Did she actually tell you you couldn't see me?
SEYMOUR: No, no... not exactly... she just doesn't understand how I would know somebody like you...
ENID: What does she mean by that - somebody like me"?"
SEYMOUR: Just someone so young...
ENID: You must have done something to make her think you like me.
SEYMOUR: I... I don't think so.
ENID: Does that mean you don't like me?
SEYMOUR: No, of course not.
ENID: So, do you like me, Seymour?
SEYMOUR: In what way do you mean?
ENID: In whatever way you think I mean.
SEYMOUR: I don't know... I'm sorry, but Dana's a very jealous person. I just don't want to screw that up right now... I'm sure she'll dump me soon and we can go back to being friends...
ENID: I don't think you understand how I really feel about you, Seymour.
SEYMOUR: ...What do you mean?
ENID: Nothing. Don't worry, I won't bother you any more.
ENID: Where are we? This is a weird neighborhood...
REBECCA: It's a totally normal, average neighborhood!
ENID: I just mean it's weird to me... I've never been anywhere near here in my life.
REBECCA: Josh says this is a really good neighborhood...
ENID: What? When did you see Josh?!
REBECCA: He came into work.
ENID: Why? What did he say?
REBECCA: Nothing.
ENID: When was this?
REBECCA: I don't know! God, don't act so jealous I only talked to him for two minutes.
REBECCA: Twenty-seven fifty-three... do you see it? That must be it...
ENID: Great...
REBECCA: What?! It looks totally normal... what's wrong with it?
ENID: I said great"..."
REBECCA: Oh yeah, I can tell you really love it!
ENID: Well, what am I supposed to say? I can't wait to live in some depressing shit-hole in the middle of nowhere"?!"
REBECCA: There's something wrong with every single place we look at! Why don't you just come right out and tell me you don't want to move in with me?!
ENID: Because you'll freak out and act like a total psycho about it.
REBECCA: You're the psycho! You haven't been able to deal with anything since high school ended!
ENID: You're the one who's still living out some stupid seventh-grade fantasy!
REBECCA: FUCK YOU! Have fun living with your dad for the rest of your life!
