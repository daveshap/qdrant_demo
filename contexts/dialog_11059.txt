PENTANGELI: Rosato, where's your brother?
ROSATO: Sitting right behind you.
PENTANGELI: He don't want to talk?
ROSATO: We worked it all out beforehand.
PENTANGELI: Are we going to eat or what?
ROSATO: Sure, on me. I got Diner's Club.
PENTANGELI: Forget it; I'm suddenly without an appetite. You're making big trouble, Carmine.
ROSATO: You weren't straight with us, Frankie, what else could we do?
PENTANGELI: We could have talked first, saved a lot of running around.
ROSATO: You wasn't listening, you didn't want to talk.
PENTANGELI: Don't I look like I'm listening?
ROSATO: We want Brooklyn one hundred percent. No more taxes to you. We want to be only loosely connected with your family -- sort of a under-family all of our own. Then we can act on all internal matters without talking. Also we want you to inform Michael Corleone that we can deal directly with him.
PENTANGELI: I'm a little hungry, maybe I'll order something. Joe. Get me some bracciole or something. And pay cash. And in return for these concessions, what do you do for me?
ROSATO: We will release the hostages, number one. Number two, we're here for you to count on when you need us. We're independent, but we're here if you need us. In general, we'll cooperate with you and your businesses, and you in turn will cooperate with us. Pari persu.
PENTANGELI: Pari Persu; what the fuck is Pari persu...?
ROSATO: My lawyer went over this beforehand.
PENTANGELI: What assurances do I have that there will be no more kidnapping, no more hits?
ROSATO: The same assurance we got from you.
PENTANGELI: What if I say shove it?
ROSATO: Then Carmine Fucillo and Tony Blue DeRosa will need to be fitted for slabs.
PENTANGELI: You want a war?
ROSATO: We got no choice.
PENTANGELI: You know if there's a way I'll go to the commission and the commission will side with me. That puts me and the other New York families against you.
ROSATO: We got friends in the commission.
PENTANGELI: I'm talking about Italians!
ROSATO: What about Michael Corleone?
PENTANGELI: He supports me.
ROSATO: Maybe, yes... maybe no.
