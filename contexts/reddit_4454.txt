Does anyone else not feel heard?
Sometimes I feel like people aren't hearing the real me, especially those closest to me.  Asking for help is the hardest thing for me and when I feel like they don't understand the severity of me asking for help it can push me deeper and deeper into the dark spaces.  Has anyone else felt this way and have any tips that might help?
