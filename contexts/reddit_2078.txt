I go to a school with a 100% acceptance rate
Hey guys. I'm in my 5th year and gonna graduate with an engineering degree in spring 2020.
My school has a 100% acceptance rate and it's awesome! I admit it may not be the best fit for everyone, but I like it because it it's super chill.

I'm doing an awesome internship right now, and my classmates are also doing great. They work at places like Microsoft, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, NASA, Space-X, ExxonMobil, and other top companies. 

So don't fret so much about getting into a top tier university, you'd be surprised at how little your school matters in the long run. It's all about what you make of it. That being said, if your dream is to go Harvard, Yale, or all those other top schools, then go for it! Just don't feel you'll be inadequate if you don't get in, and always make the best out of your undergrad career no matter where you end up.

Have a good day guys

Edit: didn't expect to get so much response! I'm glad if I helped out some struggling high school students. 

To clear the air, my school is the University of Texas at El Paso, my major is metallurgical and materials engineering with a minor in biomedical engineering (3.86 GPA if curious. GPA is not a big deal btw, it's moreso your experience) and I currently intern at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory.

UTEP was not my first choice, and I didn't get accepted to my first choice anyways. However, I don't regret it a single bit. I'm actually really glad I didn't get into my first choice, because I realize now that this school is a good fit.
