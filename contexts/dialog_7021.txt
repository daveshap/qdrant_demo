DOOLITTLE: Commander Powell, this is Doolittle. Ah, there's something serious come up, sir, and I have to ask you something.
POWELL: I'm glad you've come to talk with me, Doolittle. It's been so long since anyone has come to talk with me.
DOOLITTLE: Commander, sir, we have a big problem. You see, the Veil Nebula bomb, Bomb Number 20, is stuck. It won't drop from the bomb bay. It refuses to listen and plans to detonate in -- -- less than eleven minutes.
POWELL: Doolittle, you must tell me one thing.
DOOLITTLE: What's that, sir?
POWELL: Tell me, Doolittle, how are the Dodgers doing?
DOOLITTLE: Well, sir, the Dodgers broke up, disbanded over thirteen years ago.
POWELL: Ah... pity, pity...
DOOLITTLE: You don't understand, sir, we can't get the bomb to drop.
POWELL: Ah, so many malfunctions... why don't you have anything nice to tell me when you activate me? Oh, well, did you try the azimuth clutch?
DOOLITTLE: Yes sir. Negative effect.
POWELL: What was that, Doolittle?
DOOLITTLE: Negative effect.
POWELL: It didn't work?
DOOLITTLE: That's correct, sir.
POWELL: Sorry, Doolittle. I've forgotten so much since I've been in here. So much.
DOOLITTLE: What should we do, sir? The time is running out.
POWELL: Well, what you might try is --
DOOLITTLE: Commander Powell? Commander, hello!
POWELL: Doolittle, hello?
DOOLITTLE: Sorry, sir, you faded out there for a minute.
POWELL: Sorry.
DOOLITTLE: What were you saying, Commander, about the bomb?
POWELL: Ah... it seems to me, Doolittle... Sorry, I've drawn a blank. Hold it. I'll have it again in a minute. I forget so many things in here, so many things. Hold on, just a minute, let me think...
PINBACK: But you can't explode in the bomb bay. It's foolish. You'll kill us all. There's no reason for it.
BOMB #20: I am programmed to detonate in nine minutes. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
PINBACK: You won't consider another course of action, for instance just waiting around awhile so we can disarm you?
BOMB #20: No.
BOILER: I can tell, the damn thing just doesn't understand.
PINBACK: Look, bomb...
DOOLITTLE: Commander? Are you still there?
POWELL: Oh, yes, Doolittle, I'm thinking.
DOOLITTLE: We're running out of time, sir.
POWELL: Oh, yes... Well, Doolittle, if you can't get it to drop you'll have to talk to it.
DOOLITTLE: Sir?
POWELL: Talk to the bomb.
DOOLITTLE: I already have, sir, and Pinback is talking to it now.
POWELL: No, no, Doolittle, you talk to it. Teach it Phenomenology, Doolittle.
DOOLITTLE: Sir?
POWELL: Phenomenology...
