KREMPE: In science, the letter of fact is the letter of law. Our pursuit is as dogmatic as any religious precept. Think of yourselves as disciples of a strict and hallowed sect. Someday you may be priests... but only if you learn the scripture chapter and verse. Any questions?
VICTOR: But surely, Professor, you don't intend we disregard the more... philosophical works.
KREMPE: Philosophical?
VICTOR: Those which stir the imagination as well as the intellect. Paracelsus, for one.
KREMPE: Paracelsus?
VICTOR: Or Albertus Magnus. Cornelius Agrippa...
KREMPE: What is your name?
VICTOR: Victor Frankenstein, sir. Of geneva.
KREMPE: Of Geneva. Tell me, Mr. Frankenstein of Geneva. Do you wish to study medicine? Or mysticism?
