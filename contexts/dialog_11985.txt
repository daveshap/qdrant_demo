DUSTY: How ya doin', man?
ELLIOT: I told him about your work, and he's very excited.
DUSTY: Yeah, I got an Andy Warhol. And I got a Frank Stella, too. Oh, it's very beautiful. Big, weird...you know. If you stare at that Stella too long, the colors just seem to float. It's kinda weird.
LEE: Are you excited about becoming a collector? DUSTY Yeah.
LEE: Yeah?
DUSTY: I got a lot more to learn, though. I really wasn't into art when I was a kid.
LEE: Uh-huh.
