KATHARINE: Why did you follow me yesterday?
ALMÁSY: Excuse me?
KATHARINE: After the market, you followed me to the hotel.
ALMÁSY: I was concerned. As I said, women in that part of Cairo, a European women, I felt obliged to.
KATHARINE: You felt obliged to.
ALMÁSY: As the wife of one of our party.
KATHARINE: So why follow me? Escort me, by all means. Following me is predatory, isn't it?
CLIFTON: I was just saying, I'm going to cable Downing Street, see if I can't stir up a few shillings - Katharine's mother and the PM's wife are best -
KATHARINE: Darling, for goodness' sake!
CLIFTON: Well, she is!
CARAVAGGIO: Hello.
THE PATIENT: Finally! So you're our Canadian pickpocket?
CARAVAGGIO: Thief, I think, is more accurate.
THE PATIENT: I understand you were in Africa. Whereabouts?
CARAVAGGIO: Oh, all over.
THE PATIENT: All over? I kept trying to cover a very modest portion and still failed. Are you leaving us? Now's our opportunity to swap war wounds.
