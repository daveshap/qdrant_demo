Been unemployed for months, blowing through savings just to survive.
La area here.

I've been non stop applying to jobs online and reaching out to any all all connections I have. I'm starting to lose faith in myself and this world. It seems like every application is just thrown out into the wind, lost forever.

Does anyone have any advice? I need a job. I'm running out of money!
