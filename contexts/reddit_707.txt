Weird dilemma about my relative, and how it's causing problems in my life.
I refuse to give specific personal details on this subject (like names, places etc.), but basically I'm in a frustrating dilemma. 

I'm related to a nationwide known politician, who was recently accused of fraudulent money handling, and while there's no hard evidence that shows this (atleast according to the court proceeding), my classmates have started bullying me thinking that I've benefited from corruption. 

What scares me even more is that people think that my accomplishments (ie. high grades, math competition wins etc.) are due to systemic nepotism done by my relative. It seems like it bars me from taking pride in any of my accomplishments.

Even though I try to bring up my case in defense of my relative, they scoff and think that I'm just biased. It's like that one accusation had already made it seem like it happened. 

The thing is, it's like I'm being blamed for something my relative ALLEGEDLY did. And what even scares me the most is if the accusations are true (which is possible but improbable).

So what do I do? How do I deal with this?
PS: I don't live in any western and/or european country.
