I got in a car accident today.
No one was hurt. Thats the important thing. But im only 17. How can I hope to drove again with the fear of getting in another accident? How can I go out with my girlfriend when I fear getting into an accident? If anything happened to her I wouldnt live with myself. Ive only had my licence for a month and im already afraid to get in a car.
