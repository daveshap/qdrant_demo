PINHEAD: Oh. No Boxes. Such a shame.
FEMALE CENOBITE: No more delays, Kirsty. No more teasing. Time to play.
PINHEAD: Time to play.
KIRSTY: Wait!
PINHEAD: No more deals, Kirsty. It's your flesh we want to experience, not your skill at bargaining.
KIRSTY: No deals! Just information. Information. Free of charge. No strings. Just information.
PINHEAD: Go on. But trick us again, child, and your suffering will be legendary even in Hell.
PINHEAD: What is this? Someone else you think escaped us, like Frank?
KIRSTY: No, No, this one didn't escape. You told me you'd always been in Hell. You were wrong. Look at it. LOOK. IT'S YOU.
PINHEAD: Nonsense, I...
KIRSTY: It's you! You HAVEN'T always been as you are. You were HUMAN. Remember. Remember all your confusions. Think!
