Dating is ruthless
Met a wonderful girl on tinder. We hit it off and began dating without calling each other “boyfriend/girlfriend”. I fell for her hard. She said I was everything she looked for in a partner. Out of nowhere she began acting distant, unaffectionate, and then just texted me “this isn’t going to work out.” We only dated for a month and a half, but I met her family, her friends and I began to open up to her and trust her. She did the same with me. I thought we would begin to actually date one another, but I guess that’s not the case. I just needed to vent this out. 

Moral of my story: dating is ruthless, folks. Don’t give your heart away so easily to people who don’t deserve it. Be careful
