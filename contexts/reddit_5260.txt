Attitude to work, blue collar and white collar jobs
I come from an ex-mining town in the UK, in my late 20s and recently started work as a Surgical Sales Account Manager.

Out of my group of friends I'm one of the only ones who has a 'white collar job' working in sales, rather than going into a manual labour role straight from school with family members/friends.

Acustome to tormenting each other in my.group of friends, a common one that comes up is I have an office job compared to their 'hard-working'manual jobs.

I enjoy what I do and have studied and worked hard to get here, but having never been on the other side of the collar I've never experienced what my friends do and how it compares.

With that in mind how do you guys perceive being in a sales position, how does it stack up in terms of 'working hard' in comparison to manual jobs, and why would this be something people bring up to me?
