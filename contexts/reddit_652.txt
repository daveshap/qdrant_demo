I’m sick of my parents doubting me
I’m in college, currently in my junior year. My parents keep doubting that I’ll be able to get a job on my own and they believe they have to give me/get me one. It’s beyond frustrating, I’m a perfectly capable kid, I have a fellowship lined up for the next two semesters as well as an internship over the summer. I network with my professors and TA’s and will be getting my resume underway this semester. I just hate how my dad keeps thinking I can’t get anywhere without him. I’m sick of them having a hand in everything I do. I just want to find my way without them forcing me into this or that which they have done my whole life. I want separation and independence.
