More popular place in terms of the flow of people You have 2 places in the city, one place is being passed by more people per day than the other one, meaning that the flow of people in the first one is higher than the flow of people in the second one.Question:How would you describe this kind of \"popularity\" of one place in comparison to another?Example:<blockquote>  The location of their pop-up store in the center was much more ______ than the one in the suburbs, that is why they got rid of the second one.</blockquote>The words lucrative and profitable are not suitable for this case.Thank you!
