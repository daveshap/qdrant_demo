DOYLE: I thought I told everybody to get out of my house. That includes cocksuckers and retards. Get off your asses and go.
LINDA: This is not your house, Doyle. This is my house and I'll say who stays and goes. You've got a house, why don't you go get one of your girlfriends and go home to it.
DOYLE: You know better than to talk like that when I'm hurtin'. Don't make me knock the piss out of you.
VAUGHAN: Doyle, don't you lay one hand on her.
DOYLE: That's funny. You go to bed and take snot nose with you.
LINDA: You're not stayin' here tonight. Go get sober before you come back. I'm tired of my child seein' this. Now you get yourself straight or I'll lock your ass out of my life for good.
DOYLE: You know what I told you, you even think of leavin' me, I'll kill you dead as a doornail.
LINDA: That might be better than this.
VAUGHAN: I'm a witness. I heard you threaten her life.
DOYLE: I thought I told you to keep out!
LINDA: Leave.
DOYLE: Don't tell me what to do.
LINDA: Leave.
DOYLE: Don't tell me what to do.
LINDA: Leave.
DOYLE: Don't tell me what to do.
LINDA: Leave.
DOYLE: Don't tell me what to do.
DOYLE: Okay, I'll leave and sober up. Everything's botherin' me, that's all. I'm hurtin' Linda. I love you.
FRANK: I hate you!
DOYLE: Well, I hate you, too. No I don't. I love your mama. Nobody understands what I go through. I'll leave. You bunch of freaks have fun. I'll call you tomorrow honey. I'm sorry. You can kiss my ass, really. You ever hit me again you little bastard and I'll make you sorry your daddy ever squirted your little ass out.
FRANK: You all right, Mama?
LINDA: I'm fine, honey. Let's just try and forget about tonight.
FRANK: We don't need to think bad thoughts, do we Mama?
LINDA: No, honey, we don't. I'll make some coffee and start cleanin' up this mess. Karl, you want some coffee, huh?
