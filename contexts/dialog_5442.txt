BROCK: They do take their time. So..Selina Kyle...
LANE: Selina Kyle...lovely person.
BROCK: She has a real spirit.
LANE: A bit on the suspicious side, don't you think?
BROCK: She has reason to be suspicious..Doesn't she?
LANE: I suppose she does.
LANE: I better go report this in...
BROCK: Oh, you don't have to explain to me where you're going...
SPOOKY: I want out of tonight's mission. I can't do it anymore, Captain. I can't let innocent people die to prove our superiority..I can't.
CAPTAIN GOD: Just like a woman. You want out. You're out.
SPOOKY: Why are you--I fought for you with honor. Why should it matter if I'm a man or a woman, as long as I'm a good warrior.
CAPTAIN GOD: Of course it matters! It throws off everything! Superhero" is manhood's highest achievement. Manhood! Your dirty little secret has diseased us to the core. You were my buddy
SPOOKY: I loved you.
CAPTAIN GOD: I know.
CACTUS: Ah, did you hear that? Spooky loved you...
CAPTAIN GOD: Yeah...pretty gross. Hurry, we've got work to do.
