CARL: How's David?
HELENA: How's David? How's David? He's terrific, Carl.
CARL: Helena --
HELENA: We watched his father get dragged away by federal agents. I don't even know how to begin to tell him where you are or when you're coming back... Or if you're coming back.
CARL: We'll get through this, I promise. I'll make it up to you --
HELENA: How? Supportive letters from prison while I'm being kicked out of our home? Do you have any idea what is happening out here? Our credit cards are maxed. The people at the bank, you should see their faces when I walk in there. I have a letter from the government telling me that anything I sell from our house will be taken against an income tax lien. Our friends are behaving like the crowd at a public hanging. Nobody will help us. Nobody will take us in. Nobody wants anything to do with us. So tell me, Carl, how you're gonna make it up to me. Tell me again how we'll get through this, and maybe while you're at it you can put your hand up against the glass so we can have a tender moment of connection.
CARL: Helena --
HELENA: Tell me what to do, Carl. I need guidance, not a fucking platitude. I'm not bringing a child into the kind of life I grew up with. I won't do it. I want our life back.
