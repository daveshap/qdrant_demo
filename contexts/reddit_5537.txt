Self taught in computer repair/hardware what jobs could I be qualified for
I have been working with computers for about 5 years Building, repairing, troubleshooting ECT, as well as some minor IT work when working for my dad(nothing server related just desktop fixes). I don't have any certifications and my highest education is high school because I'm working full time to pay bills for my house I don't have time for schooling at the moment but I'm looking to get into that field and I'm curious what jobs I may be qualified for. Any help is much appreciated
