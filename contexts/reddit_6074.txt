Interviewing/job-seeking etiquette when furloughed
I was furloughed at the end of March due to COVID-19 and my hours were reduced from 40 to 20 per week. I just started this position (my first out of college) and I really love it even if the lower pay is not sustainable for me longterm, but I went ahead and started applying elsewhere just in case the furlough went on longer than anticipated.

Now (somewhat to my own surprise) I have another promising position that I'm currently interviewing for and feel good about, with the potential for better pay and a better title. I do still really love my current job and company, and I will be very much needed once we start to regain business, but at the same time if I have a better opportunity elsewhere, I don't know that I could turn it down, especially considering that there is still no firm indication of my return date to work and I don't qualify for unemployment in the meantime.

This pandemic is turning a lot of things upside down, so do you have any tips or advice on etiquette and expectations in a situation like this? I'm not even sure if there would be an appropriate way to leverage an offer in the current job/economic climate, and I certainly don't want to be burning bridges. How can I best look out for myself and my financial/professional future while also being considerate to both my current employer and the potential employer interviewing me?
