Is there evidence to suggest the firing of James Comey had a motive other than what was stated in the official notice from the White House?
Tonight [President Trump fired FBI director James Comey.](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/09/us/politics/james-comey-fired-fbi.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=span-ab-top-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news)

The Trump administration's stated reasoning is laid out in [a memorandum from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/05/09/us/politics/document-White-House-Fires-James-Comey.html)  That letter cites two specific incidents in its justification for the firing: Comey's [July 5, 2016 news conference relating to the closing of the investigation into Hillary Clinton's email server](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/06/us/politics/hillary-clinton-fbi-email-comey.html) and Comey's [October 28 letter to Congress concerning that investigation](https://www.washingtonpost.com/apps/g/page/politics/oct-28-fbi-letter-to-congressional-leaders-on-clinton-email-investigation/2113/) which [was followed up by a letter saying nothing had changed in their conclusions](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/11/06/us/politics/fbi-letter-emails.html) 2 days before the 2016 election.

 However, The New York Times [is reporting this evening that:](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/09/us/politics/comey-trump-fbi-live.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=b-lede-package-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news)

>Senior White House and Justice Department officials had been working on building a case against Mr. Comey since at least last week, according to administration officials. Attorney General Jeff Sessions had been charged with coming up with reasons to fire him, the officials said.

[Some analysts](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/09/us/politics/trump-fbi-investigation-nixon.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=b-lede-package-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news) [have compared the firing](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2017/05/09/cnns-toobin-on-comey-firing-what-kind-of-country-is-this/) to the [Saturday Night Massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Massacre) during the Watergate scandal with President Nixon.

What evidence do we have around whether the stated reasons for the firing are accurate in and of themselves, as well as whether or not they may be pretextual for some other reason?
