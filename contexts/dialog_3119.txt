VICKI: How'd you know it was me?
KNOX: Honey - - I would know any randomly selected square inch of Vicki Vale. If I had a good enough hint.
VICKI: Burned out. I need a vacation.
KNOX: Too much glamor, huh. What's in the bag - - Monte Carlo? Apes in Kenya?
KNOX: God, Vick, a girl could get hurt doing this.
VICKI: A girl could get killed - - so they tell me. What's new and hot in Gotham City?
KNOX: Oh, it's too good. We got a six-foot bat that swoops out of the night and preys on evildoers.
VICKI: Evildoers, huh? Big or small?
KNOX: Small so far. I think he's leaving the big fish for Harvey Dent.
VICKI: Our next D.A. -- I hear Bruce Wayne is throwing a fundraiser. Did you get your invitation yet?
KNOX: Oh, absolutely. Bruce and I are very close.
VICKI: No.
KNOX: Well, I'm starving. Will you at least buy me a hamburger?
