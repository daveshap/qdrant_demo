Jheeze this subreddit is scary
Seeing people actually go mental trying to figure out if there are any hints colleges gave them, looking at the times the email were sent to them trying to find a correlation, has honestly made me realise how unhealthy this process is.

I really do hope you guys get your decisions soon because it’s actually quite scary seeing some of you turn into a right mess every time you receive an email.

If the college states decisions are coming on a specific day, I’m not sure why you guys just don’t wait until that day comes around. The stress is not worth it :|
