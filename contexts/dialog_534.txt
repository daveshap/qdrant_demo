CLAUDIA: Let's get out of here, fast... This is not a town, it's a cemetery.
SANDRO: Who knows why they all left...
CLAUDIA: Sandro ... maybe it's best that you go in alone.
SANDRO: Are you joking?
CLAUDIA: Don't think that I want to save myself from any embarrassment, from the awkwardness of meeting Anna... It's not that; it's that you can say certain things easier if you're alone. Please, Sandro, do try to understand me... It would look like I was trying to influence you, to force you, to control you... and that makes me feel uncomfortable...
