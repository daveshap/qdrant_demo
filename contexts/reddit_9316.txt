Return 100% of the shit you do not need or use. Recaptured around $150 today!!
Im trying something new.

Instead of SAVING as the goal.... my new goal is to not buy things I do not need.

I started with simply RETURNING all of the dumb shit I did not need or use. Or bought thinking I might need or use something... that turns out... I neither needed nor used.

Hardware store: $63+ back -- I planned to grill this summer. I swear I made elaborate plans. I bought a mini grill for $58. And... I HAVE NOT USED IT IN THE 3 WEEKS SINCE I GOT IT. That went back to the store.

Grocery Store: $27 back. Yes, I did return the 42 oz of high-heat grill oil I bought a week back thinking I would grill. I HAVE NOT GRILLED. Returned!  Alongside the long grill tongs.. I did not need either of these things. So i returned them.

Hulu: ~$48 - How did I end up paying $15.99 for this? I cancelled my subscription, emailed customer service, and they refunded the last 3 mos of charges. I have not logged in for that pong. Thanks Hulu.

Netflix: $20. Not as generous, but you know what? I'm happy they refunded 2 mos of charges for something I wasnt fucking using at all when they could have chosen not to.

Was it a smidge embarassing to return an unopened walnut oil bottle to the grocery? A little. But not embarrassing enough to justify not getting my $16 back from this gentrified grease.

You know what's a lot more embarassing? Being $16 short on rent because I was too proud to return some shit I didn't need.

That's my brokeass thought.

Stop focusing on saving for just a moment. Focus on returning the money-sucking unimportant things you realize you do not need. Don't spend what you get back. Set it aside for saving.
