FRANK: Jack ... Jack ... You're acting like a kid.
JACK: No, that's your problem, Frank. You get around one of these assholes and you turn into a fucking three-year-old.
FRANK: What's the matter with you? So the piano's a little out of tune. So what?
JACK: Christ, can't you hear it?
FRANK: No! I never hear it! Maybe. Sometimes. I don't know. But I won't let it bother me.
JACK: Doesn't it matter to you?
FRANK: What matters to me is we've got the six easiest nights we've had in ten years. So 'Tie a Yellow Ribbon' sounds a little flat. So what? Nobody's gonna hear it, Jack. Nobody. So why should you care?
JACK: Because I can hear it.
FRANK: Well, then stuff cotton in your ears, because come six o'clock we're gonna walk into that dining room with smiles on. Understand, little brother?
