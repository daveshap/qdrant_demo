I think I give up
I tried to talk to people and got pushed away. I tried a therapist and she didn't help. I tried to get a better lifestyle. I am tired of faking it, feeling tired off everything, crying myself to sleep and waking up scared and sweating, and most of all I am tired of people saying that they are their for me and turn their backs when I need help. I just want a hug I want to feel like I mean something to someone even just for a moment. But I am giving up it will never happen. I am sorry for bugging any of you. Just need to say what I was thinking. I'm sorry..
