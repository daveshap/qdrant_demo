In light of the msnbc article this morning regarding Trumps interest in Nukes, what ability does a sitting president have to use Nukes? What oversight exist on the national and international level.
The article in question: http://www.cnbc.com/2016/08/03/trump-asks-why-us-cant-use-nukes-msnbcs-joe-scarborough-reports.html

NOTE: I'm not interested in discussing Trump or the validity of claims in the article. 

I want this discussion to center around how a President could act within or outside the law to launch a nuke and what the implications would be. Could an act be stopped before launch if a President went rogue? Does the military have to listen to the president? 

On am international level what treaties does this violate and is there precedence that allies would de facto support us or would they dissent?
