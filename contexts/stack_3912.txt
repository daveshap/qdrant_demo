We ran random forest with those features. one of the feature has zero feature importance.My question is:For those features that has zero importance in the random forest model, should I remove it and rerun the model?I did try that. When I remove the feature and rerun random forest, the importance of 7th important feature became zero, what should I do?Thanks a lot for any expert opinion...
