Finance department is being outsourced - probably will lose my job freaked out about next steps
So my company is going through a phased project to review accounting and finance departments for opportunities to out source.  My department is in the first phase and I'm positive that the work I do will end up going overseas.  The whole department is in a panic (think sinking ship) and I've been losing sleep.  I have an MBA and bachelors and a pretty solid track record performance wise (in accounting).

I'm just struggling with what to do next.. I've been with this company for 10 years and I'm hoping I can leverage my contacts to get a new job in another department in this company but I'm afraid that accounting and finance might not be as secure of a job as it used to be and I'll be jumping into a department that might get outsource along the line.  My resume is up to date and I've been applying but I'm afraid since I'm at the cap of my salary range I'll probably have to take a pay cut to move into my next role (a lower level job).  The company's job board has many entry level positions but no associate manager/specialist roles.  I'm afraid to look outside the company since I have connections here and the idea of being unemployed and all that goes with it scares the crap out of me.

My career has had its ups and downs, the first 5 years I was doing really well, then I took a new job that was not a good fit for me. I had to leave within the year and take a lower level job. Its been three years since that so I've been promoted back up to my old level.  I'm not sure how best to spin that when interviewing.  Just posting this to get it off my chest and to see if anyone has had similar experiences.
