Is it OK to still be searching & applying for jobs even though I recently started a new one?
I’ve made some posts here in the past and am very thankful for the advice I’ve received. In October, I started a full time position in my field. I took a decent pay cut from my previous job out of my field in attempts to get some experience. It wasn’t my dream job or anything, but it was something to help make connections/make myself more valued in my field.

The pay difference is rough. Lack of enthusiasm is prominent in the company due to this. A lot of my coworkers say the pay is the main reason they hate the job— even after “promotions”. It’s your typical entry level job. It’s about 15k lower than average (our salary is 34k). 

My issue is, I have a lot of experience. Even my boss told me while interviewing me I would be underpaid based on my qualifications, but despite sending out hundreds of applications, I was never invited to interviews. He felt like he struck gold! I took the job hoping that some out of college experience would help.

It’s only been a few months and it is dreadful. My boyfriend is at our old company and continues to get promotions, while I continue to struggle to pay off my basic expenses. Thankfully, he is supporting me in necessary areas, but I am still frustrated. Not to mention work is SO SLOW. I am constantly bored. Constantly asking for more work/more responsibility just to help the day go by. 

Is it bad that I’m looking for other jobs and will switch of a better one comes around? Could I still put this on my resume or will it look bad because it is only a few months?

Overall I just feel like I sold myself short, and that I am not challenging myself. I would love to be more useful and motivated in my field, and can stay here until I find that job, but I feel bad. Any advice is helpful!
