Transitioning from academia to a corporate job. What is the single most important workplace mindset or etiquette to learn?
I (35M) just got my first "real" job after 15+ years in academia. I've studied and/or worked in four universities in two countries. If it matters, my background is in computer science and physics, and I'll be working as a software engineer in a big corporation.

The academic environment is very different from that of a company. Hierarchy is often not completely clear, side projects are encouraged, hours are very flexible, no dress code, HR is nonexistent in practice, and oftentimes there's little or no feedback.

So what's the most important thing I should learn in terms of soft skills or corporate etiquette? Or unlearn, i.e., what academic behavior I should completely leave behind?

EDIT: Thank you all who took their time to answer, you've been extremely helpful.
