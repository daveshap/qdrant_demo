Hey seniors, take this advice to heart
EDIT 2: I clearly said college was more fun.

EDIT TLDR: Enjoy having little responsibilities.


I know most of you young seniors can’t wait to get out of highschool, but really, cherish your senior year. Don’t get me wrong, I’m a sophomore in college and it’s loads more fun than highschool, but I would be lying (along with like everyone else I know) if I said I didn’t miss being a high schooler. I know it sounds like I want to relive glory days or whatever, but really, life becomes a lot more difficult in college and you actually have real responsibilities and essentially become an adult. Enjoy your senior year, don’t go too ham, have some fun with it, it will be the last year you truly at to be a “kid”. 


On another note, don’t stress if you don’t attend like an Ivy League because the truth is, it doesn’t matter. If you are attending a good university, ranging from like A&M to Harvard, there are no closed doors for you. Every oppurtunity that exist graduating from Harvard would exist for any other “good” college as well, at that point employers don’t care too much where you attended since they both give you a sufficient education, they care more about how you did there, and how you as a person will fit into their team. 

TLDR: Enjoy highschool, it is the last year you truly get to be a “kid”.
