My first check
A little while back I revealed I got a life changing job with a raise I never anticipated.  Well, after the dreaded 3 weeks of no check...it happened. 

So my state denied me unemployment due to my (unpaid) hours, and I went $326 negative in my account. My credit cards maxed at $315 and $3000. Been sneaking into the train to/from work all week and haven't had dinner since Sunday night, relying on lunches my work provides. 

Today I woke up with more money in my account than I've ever experienced in my 30 years of life, even after the -$326 I had to overcome first. 

I'm so blessed. I'm so thankful. And I'm so motivated to never be in this position again. Never give up on yourself. Good things can happen with hard work and a little luck (a lot in my case). 

Happy Friday y'all. It's the best one in a while.

Edit: again I'm blown away by the love and support here. You've built a truly welcoming and supportive space here and I'm so happy I am a part of it. Thank you all.
