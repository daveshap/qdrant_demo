I'm running out of reasons not to kill myself
I'm not going to kill myself, at least not at this point, but it hurts to live when there's nothing to live for. The only reason I haven't killed myself yet, and the only reason I'm holding back now is because I know it will hurt people around me. But I'm getting sick of staying alive solely so other people can be happy when I know I'm not going to be happy. 

I hate my past, I hate what happened to me, I hate the decisions I made, I hate my body, I hate my personality, I hate the relationships I have, I hate that I have such unattainable dreams, I hate the world I live in, and most of all I hate that either through the laws of the universe or my own weakness I can't change any of this. 

What's the point when there's literally NOTHING I can find in my present or realistically see in my future that will make me happy. I'm not going to kill myself, but I really, really, really want to.
