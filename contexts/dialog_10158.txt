MISS VAN DEUSEN: I'm glad you decided to come after all.
RENNIE: Me too. But I'm not sure Uncle Charles will be.
MISS VAN DEUSEN: You let me worry about him, okay? Personal experiences are what fuel the minds of great writers, Rennie. You made the right decision.
RENNIE: What about not-so-great writers?
MISS VAN DEUSEN: Everything okay?
RENNIE: Just felt a little chill.
MISS VAN DEUSEN: Did you know that I'm giving up teaching?
RENNIE: Really?
MISS VAN DEUSEN: Since the school is closing anyway, I'm going to write that novel I've been threatening on everybody.
RENNIE: That's wonderful, Miss Van Deusen...what's it about?
