My Dad died and half of my friends haven't said a thing
I my Dad died at the end of October, less than a month after my 18th birthday. He had cancer in his neck that metastasised from an unknown location in his body. He couldn't speak for the last month of his life because the tumor paralyzed his vocal chords and needed a feeding tube because he couldn't swallow. It's safe to say I'm now a fanatical supporter of assisted dying. He had 0 quality of life, and I just wish he could have had some dignity in his death rather than being slowly strangled. He was 50 with long brown hair, picture Aragon from LotR, but with a tube in his stomach and a breathing hole in his neck. He was still so handsome and positive even when he was dying.

My best friend's Dad died of cancer too in August and we have supported each other as well as have other friends who came to my Dad's funeral, just kindness. 

But some people who have heard about my Dad's death through word of mouth, and who I thought were my friends, have said nothing, no acknowledgement no nothing. I was talking to a 'friend' and I told him about my Dad's death and he said, yeah I'm sorry about that, I heard from x who heard from x. I was thinking to myself, why haven't these people said anything? Literally a 2 sentence Facebook message would be enough. 

Interestingly enough, others who I haven't spoken to in years really surprised me. Really heartfelt words, telling me that they were genuinely thinking of me and that they have gained a new perspective. 

Death really does polarise the genuine and the fake. Sorry for any typos I'm too tired to proof read
