Is it going to be considered “gay” to have a pair of Lululemon womens leggings?
I’m not trying to say that being gay is bad. I don’t have an opinion, but gender and identity really matter to me. I intend to begin the process of a transition from male to female, but I don’t want people saying that I’m gay when that’s not even in my plan. Asking for me.
