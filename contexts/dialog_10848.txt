VENKMAN: If you guys are right, if we can actually trap a ghost and hold it somehow, I think I could win the Nobel Prize.
STANTZ: If anyone deserves it, it's Spengler and me. We're doing all the hard research and designing the equipment.
VENKMAN: Yeah, but I introduced you guys. You never would've met if not for me. That's got to be worth something.
VENKMAN: I trust you're moving us to a better space somewhere on campus.
DEAN YAEGER: No, we're moving you OFF CAMPUS. The Board of Regents has decided to terminate your grant. You are to vacate these premises immediately.
VENKMAN: This is preposterous! I demand an explanation.
DEAN YAEGER: Fine. This University will no longer continue any funding of any kind for your group's activities.
VENKMAN: But why? The students love us!
DEAN YAEGER: Dr. Venkman, we believe that the purpose of science is to serve mankind. You, however, seem to regard science as some kind of dodge" or "hustle." Your theories are the worst kind of popular tripe
VENKMAN: I see.
STANTZ: You said you floored 'em at the Regents' meeting.
VENKMAN: Ray, I apologize. I guess my confidence in the Regents was misplaced. They did this to Galileo, too.
