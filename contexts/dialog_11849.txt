WYNN: I'm not responsible, Sam.
LOOMIS: Of course not.
WYNN: I've given them his profile.
LOOMIS: You must have told them we shocked him into a grinning idiot. Two roadblocks and an all-points bulletin wouldn't stop a five-year-old!
WYNN: He was your patient, Doctor. If the precautions weren't sufficient, you should have notified...
LOOMIS: I notified everybody! Nobody listened.
WYNN: There's nothing else I can do.
LOOMIS: You can get back on the telephone and tell them exactly what walked out of here last night. And tell them where he's going.
WYNN: PROBABLY going.
LOOMIS: I'm wasting time.
WYNN: Sam, Haddonfield is a hundred and fifty miles from here. How could he get there? He can't drive.
LOOMIS: He was doing all right last night. Maybe somebody around here gave him lessons.
