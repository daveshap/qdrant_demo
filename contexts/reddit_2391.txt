How do I tolerate a 9-5?
I just started my first job out of university a few weeks ago. I work in finance. I’ve always wanted to be in finance and had no doubt it was the right career path for me. I’ve been working for a little over a week now and I’ve never been more miserable. My boss and coworkers are very nice, the work I’m doing is challenging and engaging, the hours are manageable but i still feel empty. I never knew the 9-5 would be this soul sucking. Every morning when I sit in my chair I picture myself doing it every day for the next 40 years of my life and almost tear up. Staring at a spreadsheet and drowning in fluorescent lights is a waste of a life. Obviously there’s no conventional way out of this 9-5 life, but i just don’t understand how people make peace with it.The job is good so i know if I quit, I’ll just face the same problem somewhere else. How do I live a meaningful life while doing meaningless work?
