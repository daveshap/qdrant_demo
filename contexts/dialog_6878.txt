SEBASTIAN: I just came to say goodbye.
ANNETTE: Where are you going?
SEBASTIAN: Back to the city. I may take off to Europe for the rest of the summer. I just can't handle it around here.
ANNETTE: I think that's for the best.
SEBASTIAN: Good for you.
ANNETTE: Sebastian, please. I don't want us to end on bad terms.
SEBASTIAN: Well, I'm afraid you don't have a choice in the matter. You make me sick. You're a hypocrite and I don't associate with hypocrites.
ANNETTE: How am I a hypocrite?
SEBASTIAN: Oh please Annette. You spend all your time preaching about waiting for love. Well here it is. Right in front of you, but you're going to turn your back on it. I'm sorry that we're not at the age where we can get married. If we were, I'd propose, but that's not going to happen. So I guess we're just fucked. I'll move on, but you... you're going to have to live with yourself knowing you've turned your back on love. And that makes you a hypocrite.
ANNETTE: Please don't go.
SEBASTIAN: Get off me.
