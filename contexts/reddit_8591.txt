Layoffs galore...Why?
Can someone help explain what’s going on with all these recent layoffs happening across the country?

Can someone shed some light onto the economic forces behind this evident shift to downsizing? Isn’t the economy booming? If you could include a reference to the recent tax cuts relevance that’d be great too.
