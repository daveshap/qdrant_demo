Killing myself isn't selfish
Why should i give a fuck about other people's feelings when i end it? They never gave a fuck about mine when i was alive. Not my family, not the people i know. 

Me ending my own pain is not selfish. And if i am selfish, so fucking what? Every single cunt on this earth is selfish. People are selfish for wanting someone who wants to help themselves to live on for their own benefit. I don't give a fuck. 

If you don't give a shit about me when i was alive, dont come crying to my funeral like a fucking idiot. Fuck off.
