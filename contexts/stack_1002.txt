No Sound in ASUS ZenBook 14 UX433FN after installing ubuntu 18.04 I recently bought ASUS ZenBook 14 UX433FN which came with preloaded Windows 10 Home. I used it for a few days and everything was working perfectly fine. Then I uninstalled Win 10 and installed Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. And I could hear no sound. I tried many things found online but nothing worked. I tried installing 16.04 LTS as well but the same problem showed up. Unlike reported by many it doesn't show dummy output as audio output.What should I do?
