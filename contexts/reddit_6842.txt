Would it be unreasonable/too much for me to ask for a change of a title upon my lay off?
Backstory (details you can check my history in personalfinance sub)

I was furloughed for 3 months. Before the furlough, I worked on a project and was successful in getting the approval needed from the vendor (bring new clients/works/businesses). I even designed internal workflows for the company. The project was originally assigned to someone else but because I had background in this specific project from my previous jobs, I took it over. I was told I'd come back but alas they laid me off.

Now, my boss offered me time to talk to him when he delivered the news (lay off) to me. He's also willing to write me a recommendation and he said that I'm on the top of his list for a call back should things get back to normal.

I know I'm not getting my job back but at the very least I'd like to be recognized for my work esp since that project was outside of my daily duties.

I can't give you the details of my industry, job or the project because of confidential reasons.

So let me make things up for the sake of simplicity

Example:

My company works in chicken meat business. I was hired as a delivery guy for grocery stores. The company is trying to expand the business by delivering the meat to a famous fast food restaurant. Since, I have backgrounds doing this in my previous job. I'm familiar with this specific chain's standards, meat requirements and procedure. I was able to get my company approved in delivering their meat to this fastfood chain. 

My title when I was hired something like "Delivery/Driver". I'd like to ask my boss that my last title at this company to be something like "Senior Fast Food Delivery" guy.


Would this be unreasonable? It wouldn't cost them money? It would look good on my resume and a way of keeping things good between us?
