A2C Calendar Cycle
**January**: "How much do mid-year reports matter?" "Can I still apply to this school?" "When can I send test scores?" "if I use a VPN will I have extra time to submit my app?????"

**February**: "Ugh this wait is killing me" "I'm dying of senioritis." Many panic posts about if someone has already been rejected because they haven't gotten interview offer. Equally panicked posts about some people getting likely letters. Top meme season, as many of us are bored. "ANY LAST MINUTE ADVICE FOR INTERVIEWS??".

**March**: "Any news on this schools decision date?" Shit load of results threads from every T20 and "I got into this school!" posts. Juniors starting to ask about schedules. Should I update colleges one week before decisions come out?

**April**: Questions about waitlists (z-list?????) Also posts of this college vs that college. Questions about putting down 2 enrollment deposits. Depression and existential crisis part 2. Humble brags.

**May**: Many last minute questions about schools on May 1st. Posts about getting off waitlists. "Will I get rescinded for 2 B's?" "Got into Harvard AMA!"

**June**: Happy or sad senior posts about leaving high school (depends on the person). "Thank you A2C for everything you've done for me" posts. Juniors begin to outnumber seniors.

**July**: New crop of seniors asking about colleges are probably doing many visits. Every post is tagged with "rising senior".

**August**: Seniors starting school. "I'm so mediocre" pessimist posts begin and early birds complain about essays. Resource compilation posts are upvoted/stickied. "I only earn 250k, in that sad lower middle class zone, how will I ever go to college?"

**September**: College freshmen will make AMA posts, even though they are still in the honeymoon phase at their new school, like they've experienced it all. "What are subject tests?" "do I need subject tests?" "Is a 790 Subject test good?" "Does recommended mean required?" "Does required mean required?"

**October**: Over achievers submit early applications. First acceptances from rolling state school. Everyone is so hype to see that stuff and then it gets triggering when you haven't gotten into a school yet. Lots of essay questions. And no, your love for hentai is not appropriate for your UChicago essay.

**November**: Questions about ED/EA deadlines. The inevitable question about if someone can apply to 2 ED schools. "Should I submit my 35 ACT or 1590 SAT?"

**December**: Lot of heartbreak after ED rejections. Let's get cracking on the RD essays. People rant about how shitty their winter break will be. "10 essays and 3 days fml". "Does 11:59 mean 11:59 EST or what? Is there a grace period? does January 1st mean December 31st 11:59 PM or January 1st 11:59 PM?" Depression and existential crisis part 1.
