Does an impeachment inquiry require a full House vote?
[Recent reports from the White House state that it will not comply with Congressional subpoenas, stating as its rationale that a full House vote has not been conducted to confirm an official impeachment inquiry.](https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/white-house-pelosi-letter-wont-cooperate-impeachment-probe) [The House has issued subpoenas to the White House for information pertaining to Trump's solicitation of foreign election interference](https://oversight.house.gov/news/press-releases/white-house-subpoenaed-in-house-impeachment-inquiry).

Does the Constitution require a full House vote for an impeachment inquiry to occur?  Does Pelosi need to wait for the House to return from recess to hold such a vote?

Is Congress able to obtain the subpoenaed information anyway under its powers of [congressional oversight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_oversight#Powers_and_prerogatives)?

Does refusal to comply with the subpoena represent an impeachable offense, [Contempt of Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contempt_of_Congress), under either scenario?


For historical purposes, Contempt of Congress was [Article III in President Nixon's Articles of Impeachment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_process_against_Richard_Nixon).

> In his conduct of the office of President of the United States, Richard M. Nixon, contrary to his oath faithfully to execute the office of President of the United States and, to the best of his ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States, and in violation of his constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, has failed without lawful cause or excuse to produce papers and things as directed by duly authorized subpoenas issued by the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives on April 11, 1974, May 15, 1974, May 30, 1974, and June 24, 1974, and willfully disobeyed such subpoenas. The subpoenaed papers and things were deemed necessary by the Committee in order to resolve by direct evidence fundamental, factual questions relating to Presidential direction, knowledge or approval of actions demonstrated by other evidence to be substantial grounds for impeachment of the President. In refusing to produce these papers and things Richard M. Nixon, substituting his judgment as to what materials were necessary for the inquiry, interposed the powers of the Presidency against the lawful subpoenas of the House of Representatives, thereby assuming to himself functions and judgments necessary to the exercise of the sole power of impeachment vested by the Constitution in the House of Representatives.
