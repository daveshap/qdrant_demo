Does anybody else get insanely nervous when other people yell in public?
I'm talking like: somebody yelling in a situation that has nothing to do with you, but you still think A. oh god, what's my responsibility here, and/or B. what if they start yelling at me?  Maybe it's because I got a lot of yells from cars when I was younger (for some reason), I just think they're gonna start yelling at me too.  Wondering if this happens to anybody else.
