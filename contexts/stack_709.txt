OpenVPN & Network-Manager-OpenVPN & Connecting to Internet ipv4 I'm trying to route internet traffic through my vpn. I've set up everything using a tutorial. Now, I've heard that OpenVPN can only handle either ipv4 OR ipv6. So I wanna stick with ipv4. I disabled ipv6 in the network manager on my pc, but now, ipv6 websites are still sent over ipv6 without the VPN. How can I prevent this?Thanks!! :)
