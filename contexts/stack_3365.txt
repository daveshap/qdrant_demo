Anime short about two girls shooting each other with guns from their mouths I saw an anime short some years ago on YouTube. I can't find it anywhere. The things that I remember are:The \"protagonist\" is a girl with brown hair tied up and yellow clothes.  She is a robot that is controlled by a group of some kind of small animal (I don\u2019t remember what kind.)It began with her waking up, the animals beginning to control her to get up.There was her friend (well, ex-friend) who had black hair and dark clothes and was a robot too, controlled by little bunnies. It seemed these bunnies killed one of the little animals of the brown-haired girl, so they started fighting, making the two girls start shooting each other with guns from their mouths.The animals on the head of the girl spoke. I don't remember any other character speaking, maybe the mother of the protagonist saying to the girl she was late?There was a guy too, it seems the protagonist liked him because of a photo she was holding on one part.The title was probably in English, since there were so many people writing about the story being a representation of a promise that was broken that made three friends fight.The protagonist killed the guy too, he was a ''ikemen''. I remember the animal inside the protagonist head saying something about it.More things happen after that, but I don't remember so well.
