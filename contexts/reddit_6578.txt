DAE work in a very mixed social class workplace?
What I mean is in the same office (within vicinity of each other) there's folks who have a good education, make well into 6 figures, have a nice vehicle, nice house in the upper middle class suburbs and just cruising through life for the most, and others who have GED's who may be just barely making it after their paychecks, they may be commuting from far away due to living costs, paying child support for multiple kids, just going nowhere in life financially.

I am in one of those workplaces now, albeit I'd say 70% of the office leans toward latter's side vs the former. Is this type of mixed social class workplace common?
