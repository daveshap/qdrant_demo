How can I tell if my iPad is 32 or 64-bit? How can I tell if my iPad is 32 or 64-bit? I use iOS 9.3.5.I don't want to have to look at the back of my iPad (the iPad is badly scratched, I can't read anything on it, e.g. I cannot read the model number). I also don't know anything about the iPad (e.g., I don't know which yet it was purchased). The only information I have access to is whatever the programs installed on the iOS are telling me.
