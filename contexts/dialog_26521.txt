LOIS: I'm telling you, I was there.
CLARK: You were probably so scared you didn't look to see what the trick was.
LOIS: It wasn't a trick!
CLARK: Oh sure. A man flies in the sky like a pigeon and it wasn't a trick.
LOIS: Clark Kent, if you had only seen it the way I did, you -
CLARK: It was done with wires. They must have rigged him like they do with Peter Pan.
LOIS: There weren't any wires. I looked.
CLARK: Mirrors, then. It's done with mirrors.
LOIS: He grabbed me! He held me! He set me down gently! How could that be done with mirrors?
CLARK: Look, there was probably a trampoline on the roof somewhere and this joker just took a big bounce.
LOIS: Why would he do that? How would he know I was going to suddenly slip.
CLARK: I don't know, Lois, but I do know a fraud when I hear one. This thing goes against all natural laws.
LOIS: You're just jealous.
CLARK: Jealous? Of what?
LOIS: Of this...Superman.
CLARK: What'd you call him?
LOIS: Superman. Pretty good name for him, isn't it?
CLARK: Is that what they're calling him?
LOIS: They will once I hang it on him in tomorrow's edition.
CLARK: Super...man. Hmmm...
LOIS: It isn't that I still don't like you, Clark. It's just that...well, once you've had something like that happen to you, it kind of changes a girl. I'm going to make some coffee. You want some?
CLARK: No thanks.
