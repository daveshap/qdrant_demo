I didn’t get the job, but I got something better than a denial email
I had applied to 2 jobs from a site that didn’t have thousands of listings (which may be the reason) but like most applications, I didn’t expect to hear back except to schedule a call. Well, today I got an email from one of those companies which explained they had decided to pursue other candidates but to thank me, they gave me a $50 credit to order from their site.  How cool is that?!? They make custom items and were sure to mention that the $50 would cover an order. What a great way to lessen the sting while also potentially gaining a customer?
