MILES: Where is Stephanie?
JACK: Upstairs. Getting cleaned up.
MILES: What the fuck are you doing?
JACK: What?
MILES: With this chick.
MILES: Does she know about Saturday?
JACK: Um... not exactly. But I've been honest. I haven't told her I'm available. And she knows this trip up here is only for a few days. Besides...
MILES: Besides what?
JACK: Well... I don't know, just... the wedding.
MILES: What?
JACK: Well, I've been doing some thinking.
MILES: Oh, you've been thinking. And?
JACK: I may have to put the wedding on hold is all.
