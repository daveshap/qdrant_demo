Project On The Fly CRS i am going through the qgis 2.18 training manual, Forestry Application (georeferencing) I am using Windows OS8. When i load rautjarvi_aerial.tif or forest_stands.shp layers, there is no visual.When i click on Zoom to layer, they will show but the other layers will now show.I have followed the manual instructions to the letter but no luck. Is there a bug i am unaware of?Any assistance will be nice.
