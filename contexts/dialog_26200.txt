JEFF: Oh, no, no, no. This is no big deal, you know? I can come down and, and get you out.
TIM: No, no. I'm not, I'm not talking about this. I did a bad thing, Jeff.
JEFF: What? What'd you do?
TIM: That chick, Erica?
JEFF: Well, w-what happened?
TIM: Well, I, you know, I took her to the van, you know. It was goin' all hot and heavy and she started hanging on me, you know? And she started crying, Tim
JEFF: What'd you do?
TIM: I hit her.
JEFF: You hit her? Oh, wait, wait a minute. Why'd you hit her?
TIM: Because I was fucked up, man. I just kept hittin' her till she didn't move anymore.
JEFF: Wait a minute, wait a minute. She's unconscious?
TIM: Go look, man. Go look. Go see for yourself, if you got the guts.
JEFF: Oh fuck.
NAZEER: You know, this, what you're doing with your life...
JEFF: I don't know.
NAZEER: You know, it's not you. You know? You seem like a smart guy.
JEFF: Yeah, well, thank you for the advice, but you wouldn't understand what is going on with me.
NAZEER: Oh, it's very complicated, huh?
JEFF: That's right.
NAZEER: Complicated or not, life moves on. Hm?
