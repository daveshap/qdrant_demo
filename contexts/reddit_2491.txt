Name a job that typically requires experience to get hired, but really any person with enough intelligence could do?
As an example I work in the Logistics industry. My job requires a bachelor's degree and 2 years experience in the field. I was hired with zero experience, zero knowledge of the industry, and an associate's degree. I was referred by a current employee who spoke to my experience in overall business knowledge, customer service, professionalism etc. I learned the entire job in three weeks and now I'm training people. I am generally a very fast learner and did the same thing in other industries. I find a lot of jobs are like this and I'm looking at entering a new industry once again. Wondering what some might be where there are requirements, but if they just met me they would see I have the talent and skills to learn and do the job.

Of course there are many jobs that require specific education, licensing, etc. I would refer to those as skilled professions (doctors/nurses, electrician, etc).

So the question is, what jobs typically have educational/experience requirements that you don't actually need to be good at the job after some training?
