Is anyone else completely averse to brown-nosing?
I literally can’t brown-nose. It’s against my entire being to do it. I deal with people for who they are, and if I like you then I like you...and if I don’t, then I don’t. I’m not going to suck up to anyone who I don’t respect, regardless of title. I stand my ground and speak the truth and adhere to what I know is the right thing to do. 

This has obviously caused some clashes in the corporate world, because I simply won’t play the game. But honestly, I don’t care. 

Anyone else like this?
