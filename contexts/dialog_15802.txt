SERA: I'll be back home around three. If you're back by then we can watch TV or something... I guess what I'm saying is... that I hope you are back when I get home. Please be careful.
BEN: You be careful to. I'm going to miss you.
SERA: Shall we go away for a couple of days?
BEN: Yeah... I'd like that.
