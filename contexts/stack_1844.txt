\"We have showed that\"/ \"We have shown that\" or \"We showed that\"? In the summey of my physics paper, for a scientific journal, in the start of a new paragraph in the discussion, what is more correct to write? \"We have showed that\" the system obeys this and that rules, or: \"We have shown that\"... or simply:  \"We showed that\"...? Thanks!
