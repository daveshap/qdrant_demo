PAULA: Mom, I need to talk to you.
MARIAN: If it's about the bikers, dear, I don't want to talk about it.
PAULA: No, I had a dream about daddy. Do you think I'll ever meet anyone like him?
MARIAN: Oh, I hope so, dear.
PAULA: You know that guy in the pictures you saw?
MARIAN: Aaron?
PAULA: Yeah ... turned out to be a real jerk.
MARIAN: I'm sorry.
PAULA: It's unusually quiet tonight, isn't it?
MARIAN: Mm hmm.
PAULA: I think you should consider coming out and staying with me longer.
MARIAN: Oh, I don't want to be in the way. You've got your career and everything.
PAULA: You wouldn't be in the way. I like having you around.
MARIAN: Dear, I was thinking. Why don't we go to Paris next year? I've never been. Your father, God bless him, wasn't much for traveling.
PAULA: I'd love to.
PAULA: Here you go. I think you should talk to Dr. Byrne when you get back about how much Valium he's prescribing. Okay?
MARIAN: At my age, I'm going to take any pill that makes me feel better.
PAULA: Mother!
MARIAN: I can make my own decisions.
PAULA: I love you, Mom. I have to run. You remembered to call the limousine service, right?
MARIAN: Mm hmm.
PAULA: Well, bye. And have a safe trip ... and ... Paris in the spring!
MARIAN: Goodbye, sweetheart.
