Amazon Recruiting Q regarding 3rd-party recruiter policies for corporate jobs
Hi r/jobs

TLDR: Does Amazon have a 6-month ban for recruiting applicants that had previously interviewed for but not been offered a job? Also, can 3rd-party recruiters not submit applications for candidates with open applications?

I just got off the phone with a 3rd-party recruiting company for Amazon regarding a corporate job. Interview went great until; 1) I was asked if Iâ€™m currently applying for any other roles at Amazon and 2) have I interviewed with Amazon in the last 6 months?

1) I have 3 open apps @ amazon.jobs for similar roles that have not been actioned by Amazon

2) I recently interviewed for an entirely unrelated role but was not selected (thankfully in hindsight)

The recruiter today told Me that I was not eligible for referral from him to the hiring manager because I had open applications and had recently interviewed for a role that I was not selected for.  

He also told me to withdraw my 3 other applications to see if he could get my application to the Hiring Manager he's contracted with.  

Does anyone know if these statements are true, and do you have any recommendations on a path forward?
