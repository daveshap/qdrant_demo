Who or what is responsible for the prevalence of autocracies in the Middle East?
The Arab Spring, a widespread popular movement in the Middle East to democratize society, [has largely fizzled out](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/01/arab-spring-anniversary/416301/) with little to show for it: it succeeded fully only in Tunisia, and additionally spawned a short-lived Islamic government in Egypt and a civil war in Syria. 

For much of the world, however, the Arab Spring brought into focus the prevalence of autocracy in the Middle East ([see this list](https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/freedom-world-2017)) and brought forth a discussion of its causes, including potential Western culpability and responsibility. 

Some have cited Western interference for causing the issues stretching through the present day, citing [American](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/19/cia-admits-role-1953-iranian-coup) and [Soviet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet%E2%80%93Afghan_War) political interference in the region throughout the Cold War. Others have gone back further, referencing the [Sykes-Picot Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement) or even the legacy of Ottoman imperialism. Still others toss out such political theorizing entirely, [suggesting](https://intpolicydigest.org/2016/10/29/climate-change-driving-conflict-middle-east/) that persistent aridification and climate change in the region has led to conflict over scarce resources and the rise of authoritarianism to deal with the issue. Finally, the role of religious fundamentalism [cannot be ignored](http://www.internationalviewpoint.org/spip.php?article4131), though it is an open question whether it is a cause or a symptom of authoritarianism and conflict in the region ([some argue](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1408565?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) that religious fundamentalism was the only viable response in response to authoritarian repression of more liberal movements, and that actions such as suicide bombings [are perfectly rational political tools](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/the--rational--suicide-bomber?barrier=accessreg)).

What is the cause of persistent authoritarianism across the Middle East? Does the West hold any responsibility, and if so what obligations does it have towards the region? What can be done to resolve the issue?
