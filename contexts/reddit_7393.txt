Does my GPA matter if I’m not planning on getting a PhD?
I’m proud of my GPA at the moment, but I’m wondering if it’s even worth it? If I’m busting my tail to maintain over a 3.9 GPA and I don’t have a PhD program in my future, what’s the point? I’m not feeling it today and I’d love to hear your thoughts.
