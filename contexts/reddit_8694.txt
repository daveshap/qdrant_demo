What policies could be implemented to make jobs currently being taken up by (often undocumented) migrant workers (manual farm labor, landscaping, etc.) more attractive to American workers while allowing those businesses to remain competitive?
I imagine this is more complex than simply raising wages to make Americans want these jobs, which may make business less competitive, create unemployment, and raise prices on the American consumer. We are also experiencing low unemployment now, meaning fewer Americans are looking for work to begin with, much less hard, seasonal work.

America does export agricultural goods and American consumers are able to purchase internationally grown goods as well. If wages as a cost to American agricultural producers increase, their prices will as well, making American produce less competitive on the international and domestic market: https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/ag-and-food-statistics-charting-the-essentials/agricultural-trade/
