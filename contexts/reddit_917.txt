Does anyone else hate when you have to do something the next day? Like you can’t be at peace until you get it over with?
I get this everyday of my life. I can never live in the moment. I’ll be having fun for a second and then i’ll remind myself that i have to do something the next day and it makes me anxious, restless, annoyed and stressed the whole time. 

Do you guys experience this kind of anxiety? If so, how do you deal with it? 

How do you learn to live in the moment and not for the next day?
