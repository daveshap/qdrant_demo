LYNDA: Well, are we still on for tonight?
ANNIE: I wouldn't want to get you in deep trouble, Lynda.
LYNDA: Come on, Annie. Bob and I have been planning on it all week.
ANNIE: All right. The Wallaces leave at seven.
LAURIE: I'M baby sitting for the Doyles. It's only three houses away. We can keep each other company.
ANNIE: Terrific. I've got three choices. Watch the kid sleep, listen to Lynda screw, or talk to you.
ANNIE: What time?
LYNDA: I don't know yet. I have to get out of taking my stupid brother trick-or- treating.
ANNIE: Saving the treats for Bob?
LYNDA: Fun-ny. See you.
LAURIE: Look.
ANNIE: Look where?
LAURIE: Behind that bush there.
ANNIE: I don't see anything.
LAURIE: That man who drove by so fast, the one you yelled at.
ANNIE: Subtle, isn't he? Hey creep!
