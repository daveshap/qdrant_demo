Is drug legalization/decriminalization sound policy?
California, America's largest state, recently [legalized the recreational use and sale of cannabis](http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/trailguide/la-na-election-day-2016-proposition-64-marijuana-1478281845-htmlstory.html), joining seven other states as American public opinion [moves in favor](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/10/12/support-for-marijuana-legalization-continues-to-rise/) of full, national legalization. 

The US and much of the rest of the world have historically cooperated via a [series of international treaties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_Convention_on_Narcotic_Drugs) to outlaw many recreational drugs, including cannabis, LSD, cocaine and so on. Recent trends in cannabis in the United States and [other nations](http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/29/health/global-marijuana-cannabis-laws/) have thrown this old equilibrium into question. On top of this, some nations like Portugal have [experimented with](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/06/05/why-hardly-anyone-dies-from-a-drug-overdose-in-portugal/?utm_term=.1d839e2c929c) decriminalizing all recreational drugs, including "hard drugs". 

The connection between narcotic prohibition and crime has long been noted, especially with regards to [terrorists in Afghanistan](http://www.opium.org/how-does-opium-fund-terrorism.html) and [cartels in Mexico](http://www.businessinsider.com/mexican-cartel-guide-2015-12). Additionally, some have pointed out that many currently illegal drugs are [generally less dangerous](http://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2010/11/drugs_cause_most_harm) than legal ones like alcohol and tobacco. However, many currently prohibited drugs, such as cocaine and heroin, are [highly addictive](https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/understanding-drug-use-addiction) and have [significant negative health effects](https://www.drugabuse.gov/drugs-abuse/commonly-abused-drugs-charts), perhaps justifying prohibition. 

Is decriminalization and legalization of such recreational drugs sound policy? What positive effects does it have, and what are its drawbacks? Should a line be drawn on legalization between "hard" and "soft" drugs? Do nations experimenting with such policy run any legal risks as a result of the UN drug conventions they have signed?
