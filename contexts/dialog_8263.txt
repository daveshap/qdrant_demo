LADY HAMPTON: You should sit down, darling. She's quite all right. Are you pregnant?
KATHARINE: I don't think so.
LADY HAMPTON: How romantic. With Fiona I fell over every five minutes. Ronnie Christened me Lady Downfall.
KATHARINE: I think I might go inside and sit down for a few minutes.
LADY HAMPTON: I'll come with you.
KATHARINE: No, please. I shall be absolutely fine. They pass Almásy, who doesn't look up from his book.
CLIFTON: Have you seen Katharine?
ALMÁSY: What?
CLIFTON: It's Geoffrey under this.
ALMÁSY: I haven't, no. Sorry.
CLIFTON: Darling, I just heard. You poor sausage, are you all right?
KATHARINE: I'm fine. I got hot.
CLIFTON: Lady H said she thought you might be -
KATHARINE: I'm not pregnant. I'm hot. I'm too hot.
CLIFTON: Right.
KATHARINE: Aren't you?
CLIFTON: Sweltering. Come on, I'll take you home.
KATHARINE: Can't we really go home? I can't breathe. Aren't you dying for green, anything green, or rain, wouldn't you die to feel rain on your face? It's Christmas and it's all - I don't know - if you asked me I'd go home tomorrow. If you wanted.
CLIFTON: Sweetheart, you know we can't go home, there might be a war.
KATHARINE: Geoffrey, you do so love putting on a disguise.
CLIFTON: I do so love you. What do you smell of?
KATHARINE: What?
CLIFTON: Marzipan! I think you've got marzipan in your hair. No wonder you're homesick.
THE PATIENT: Are you outside? A beat and then Caravaggio shuffles in. Like an old boxer.
CARAVAGGIO: I can't hide anymore. I breathe like a dog. I lose my balance. Stealing's got harder. Caravaggio stares at the Herodotus.
CARAVAGGIO: Why do I feel if I had your book I would know everything?
THE PATIENT: I don't even know if it is my book. The Bedouin found it in the plane, in the wreckage. It's mine now. I heard your breathing and thought it might be rain. I'm dying for rain - of course I'm dying anyway - but I long to feel rain on my face.
CARAVAGGIO: Is it you? If I said Moose… I look different, fuck, why shouldn't you?
THE PATIENT: Moose.
CARAVAGGIO: First wedding anniversary - what do you call it?
THE PATIENT: I don't know. Paper. Is it? Paper? I don't remember.
