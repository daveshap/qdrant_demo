GINGER: Huh?
ACE: Isn't it bad enough you're drinkin' too much, you're takin' all my pills too?
GINGER: I didn't take your pills.
ACE: Look - for my ulcer, I take a half a one of these, a half a one of these. And that's when I have extreme pain. I had a three-month supply. What'd you do with 'em?
GINGER: You didn't have to beat him up!
ACE: What?
GINGER: I was just tryin' to help him. It's not like I'm sleeping with the guy!
ACE: Yeah, how do I know?
GINGER: You can't make me stop caring...
ACE: What? What?!
GINGER: I said, you can't make me stop caring about people.
ACE: Listen. Ginger. I'm tryin' to make the best of everything here, you know? I mean, you're my wife, for chrissakes. Uh, I mean... people look up to you in this town. I don't know what to think -
GINGER: You know what, Ace? I don't give a shit! I'm gettin' out of here. I am.
ACE: It's okay. Look... ...you gotta get a hold of yourself.
GINGER: Okay.
ACE: If not for me, at least for Amy.
GINGER: Okay, okay.
ACE: You understand? Your drinking's gettin' way out of hand. I'm gonna get you into a program. They got plenty of good ones.
GINGER: I don't need one.
ACE: Yes, you do. It's very discreet. There's no names in the papers. You don't have to worry about any of that stuff.
GINGER: That's all you care about. You don't care about me at all.
ACE: Yes, I - yes, I do.
GINGER: No, you don't.
ACE: How could you say that? You're a beautiful woman. You're destroying yourself. You don't need that stuff. You don't need that fuckin' leech livin' off you. I know you better than you know yourself. You're a tiger, you're stronger than I am. And when you set your mind on doing something, you do it better than anybody. You can do it. You can do it.
GINGER: Oh, God. Oh, God. Okay. Okay... I'll try. I'll try.
