FATHER JAMES: What is it?
PETER: Something he said, just before...
FATHER JAMES: He spoke to you?
PETER: Yeah. It didn't make any sense.
FATHER JAMES: Listen to me, Peter. You can't let the ravings of a madman disturb you, okay?
PETER: You're right, but it's funny. All my life I thought I was simply a man who didn't believe in any of it.
FATHER JAMES: No matter, my son, he believes in you.
PETER: But it's true. I have no faith. It's strange. When that gun was pointed at my face tonight, I was surprised, but never frightened. It was as if I knew nothing could possibly happen to me and...in that one moment I didn't care about anything. Not eve my own life.
FATHER JAMES: Peter. Your life must matter to you because it matters to all of us who love you.
PETER: You know, I respect that you have such faith, James. I don't understand it, but I want you to know that despite our differences, I admire you and I always will.
