MIKE: Hello?
LORRAINE: Hi, Mike?
MIKE: Lorraine?
LORRAINE: Are you on the other line?
MIKE: Yeah, hold on.
LORRAINE: I can call back...
MIKE: No, no. Hold on.
MIKE: Hi.
MICHELLE: I heard you might be moving back...
MIKE: Yeah, uh, I don't think that's gonna be happening any time soon... Listen, can I call you right back? I gotta take this call...
MICHELLE: I'm not home and going out of town tomorrow for a week. Can't you talk for five more minutes?
MIKE: I really want to catch up with you, but I've gotta take this call. They're holding. I'll talk with you when you get back in town. Bye.
MICHELLE: Goodbye. I lov...
MIKE: Hi. Sorry about that.
LORRAINE: You didn't have to get off the other line. I would've called you back.
MIKE: That's okay. I wanted to talk to you.
MIKE: Do you realize that I've been waiting for that call for six months and I cut her off?
ANSWERING MACHINE: You're money, baby.
MIKE: Hi, Lorraine. Thanks for holding on.
LORRAINE: Listen, Mike. You really didn't have to get off the line. I just wanted to ask you one thing. I know I shouldn't have called, I mean, my friends said I should wait two days... Oh God, I probably sound like such a schoolgirl... It's just that it's tonight only... I mean, it's Sinatra's birthday and they have this thing every year at The Room". Do you know where that is? It's impossible to find if you've never been there. I don't understand why none of the clubs in Hollywood have signs. Anyway
