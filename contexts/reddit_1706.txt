Should I invite my regional admissions counselor to my birthday party?
Hi all; I think I've just had a stroke of genius.

I haven't received an interview from my ED school yet, but it's really important that the school gets to see me as a human being, rather than grades and an essay. I just designed an online invitation to my birthday party, and I'm thinking I should invite my regional admissions counselor.

Since I didn't get an interview, I think hosting Mr. Admissions Officer at my Excellent Eighteen would provide a plethora of opportunities for him to get to know me:

* I have prepared the following playlist:
   * "Two Phones" by Kevin Gates as a metaphor for my ability to balance my academic and social lives.
   * "X Gon' Give It To Ya" by DMX to warn Mr. Admissions Officer that rejecting my application with an "X" would put his well-being in peril.
   * "Thrift Shop" by Macklemore to highlight my fiscal responsibility and natural potential as an Economics major.
   * "F\*ck Up Some Commas" by Future to apologize for minor grammatical errors in my supplements.
   * "E.T." by Katy Perry and Kanye West to indicate my interest in pursuing a minor in Aerospace Engineering.
* I will serve food and drinks exclusively of the schools colors as an implicit claim that I am a clear fit for the college.
* I have designed posters to hang in my basement bearing phrases, which clarify that academics are *always* a priority:
   * "Less drinking, more thinking."
   * "No Juuls. Joules only (1 joule = 1kgm\^2/s\^2)"
   * "Don't drink and derive."
* I am inviting 6% of my grade to my Excellent Eighteen to make the environment more comfortable for Mr. Admissions Officer, as he tends to invite around 6% of applicants to the school.
* I will provide some grant-based financial aid for Mr. Admissions Officer's travel expenses to and from my house, if he chooses to fax his 2017 Federal Tax Return and 2017 W-2 forms by November 15th.

Do you guys think this will raise my chances of admissions? Again, I personally think my Excellent Eighteen provides an opportunity for the Office of Admissions to complete their holistic evaluation of my application.
