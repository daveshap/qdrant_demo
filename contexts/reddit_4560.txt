How do I be less snappy when I’m talking to my mom?
I’m always so damn frustrated and impatient with my mom; I always feel like she’s saying the same things over and over. I understand why: when people care about one another they tend to just say the same shit to try and help even though none of us can really help one another.

I just want to know how to be less frustrated so I don’t hurt her.
