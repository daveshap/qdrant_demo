DOUG: Any chance of getting me out on bail?
JAROSLAV: What is bail?
DOUG: Will they free me?
JAROSLAV: I don't know - maybe they are talking about it now. Mr Vitovetch is a good friend of the Judge.
DOUG: Will this thing take long?
JAROSLAV: No, it should be over soon.
DOUG: You mean it's started?
JAROSLAV: Of course, you can see that lady over there, she is recording everything.
DOUG: How do I know what's being said?
JAROSLAV: I will tell you - within a week I will have the transcript and we can go through it.
