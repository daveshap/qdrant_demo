LIZ: Honey, you all right?
JIM: It's incredible, honey - the whole thing. A Lieutenant Colonel testifies that Lee Oswald was given a Russian language exam as part of his Marine training only a few months before he defects to the Soviet Union. A Russian exam!
LIZ: I cannot believe this. It's four- thirty, Jim Garrison. I have five children are gonna be awake in another hour and ...
JIM: Honey, in all my years in the service I never knew a single man who was given a Russian test. Oswald was a radar operator. He'd have about as much use for Russian as a cat has for pajamas.
LIZ: These books are getting to your mind, Mr. Garrison. I wish you'd stop readin' them.
JIM: And then this Colonel tries to make it sound like nothing. Oswald did badly on the test, he says. He only had two more Russian words right than wrong." Ha! That's like me saying Touchdown here... ...is not very intelligent because I beat him three games out of five the last time we played chess."
LIZ: Jim, what is going on, for heaven's sake! You going to stay up all night every night? For what? So you'll be the only man in America who read the entire 26 volumes of the Warren Report?
JIM: Liz, do I have to spell it out for you? Lee Oswald was no ordinary soldier. That was no accident he was in Russia. He was probably in military intelligence. That's why he was trained in Russian.
LIZ: Honey, go back to sleep, please!
JIM: Goddammit! I been sleeping for three years!
