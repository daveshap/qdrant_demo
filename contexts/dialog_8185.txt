STACY: Bobby!
DEAN: Not a very good one, but--
STACY: So you tap everyone's phone? You use computers to probe financial records? New Search and Seizure laws?
DEAN: Just for the criminals.
STACY: We won't suspend the civil rights of the good people.
DEAN: Right.
STACY: You should take this seriously.
DEAN: I think you're taking it seriously enough for both of us.
STACY: You're a lawyer. Don't you care what's going on around you?
DEAN: Something bad happened tonight.
STACY: What?
DEAN: I saw a man die.
STACY: What do you mean?
DEAN: In front of Harrison's, he got hit by a bus. I knew him. The firm did some pro bono work for his organization a few years back.
STACY: I'm sorry.
DEAN: The thing is, when I saw him, it seemed like he wanted to tell me... ...he was upset about something and he said... Doesn't matter now. I'm gonna wash up.
STACY: What'd you buy at Harrison's?
DEAN: A toaster. And no terrorist talk at dinner. You're spookin' the kids.
