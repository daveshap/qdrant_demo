Is it really that easy?
So I see on this sub and many others how dating is tilted to favour women and how they hold all the power and guys seeking advice from women about what they want so they can get in with them. So my question is, Ladies, do you feel this is true?? Because I certainly don't... like at all.

I am a woman and I 100% do not see how I am in control of this at all. I'm constantly getting ghosted, no replies to matches, on bumble I'll match with a guy and message him and almost 90% of the time that happens they either don't reply or unmatch me immediately after I send the message. When I do talk to a guy he will be talking and interested until he just goes into radio silence, or we'll go out on a date and he'll just constantly want sex the entire time basically, which sometimes is fine- I like to get laid. If sleep with them then they just slow fade away instead of being a grown ass adult and saying hey that was fun, but I'm not into pursuing anything more. I'm fine with that, but why is ghosting people so acceptable now??? It fucking sucks. I've never ghosted someone. If I don't want to see that person or talk to them anymore, I tell them. But I get ghosted constantly, seems no matter what I do. So Ladies, is it just me? Are the rest of you just having a smorgasbord of guys you pick and choose from? And they all just want to date you?  Is this as easy for the rest of you as they're are saying??
