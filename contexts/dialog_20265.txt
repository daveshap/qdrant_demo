FAITH: Kate is that you?
KATE: Uh huh.
FAITH: I didn't expect you back so soon.
KATE: Well, I realized, if you're getting married, you're gonna be needing the maid of honor, right?
FAITH: Actually, no. There's not going to be a wedding.
KATE: Oh.
KATE: Well... I ought to be getting home anyway. The kids'll be back from camp soon. The house is probably a mess.
FAITH: And Larry?...
KATE: What about Larry?
FAITH: I don't know. I've just been thinking... maybe this destiny thing is more of a do-it-yourself operation. Maybe the things that are meant to be are the things we want badly enough to fight for.
