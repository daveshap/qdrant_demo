ALICE: Who did this?
JULIE: Stu. That was right about the time we met.
ALICE: When he first came in to the sleep lab?
JULIE: Yeah...before your time.
ALICE: Jesus, honey...he always joked about you <u>curing</u> him, but I never realized what you cured him <u>from</u>.
JULIE: He hadn't gotten a good night's sleep in years. The nightmares would wake him up, and he'd start right in painting... <i></i> That boy looked like pluperfect hell.
ALICE: How do you get from <u>here</u> - to <u>there</u>?
JULIE: Switch hands.
ALICE: What?
JULIE: I'm serious. It was bicameral disjunction - right brain and left brain out of balance. He was a rightie, so I made him switch the pencil to his left hand. Just to see what'd come out.
ALICE: Monkeybone?
JULIE: Left-handed, he was <u>funny</u>. He'd been doing all this scary, intense work...then he found out he could draw this stuff, and make me laugh, and he liked that. <i></i> And then the nightmares just...stopped.
ALICE: Wow - two guys in the same brain. - Which one did you fall in love with?
