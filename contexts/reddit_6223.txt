Do large companies ever rescind offers randomly?
I accepted a job offer a couple of weeks ago with a relatively large national company in the U.S. It came after months of grueling interviews and false promises. This has left me fairly suspicious of the entire process.

I signed my job offer and received confirmation, passed my background check and received confirmation, and began my onboarding paperwork. My start date isn't for another 2 months so I'm still nervous.

I've made it this far, but what can still go wrong? How often are job offers rescinded at this point?
