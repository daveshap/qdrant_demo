MARY ROBERT: Those people are wonderful! Why don't we ever see them in church?
CHRISTY: Good point. Especially that dude you were with. I'd like to see him down front.
MARY ROBERT: Mary Clarence! You're so... different from the other sisters. Sometimes, well... sometimes you sound more like a layperson.
CHRISTY: Honey.
MARY ROBERT: I can't wait to tell Reverend Mother about all my experiences. I've learned so much.
CHRISTY: Well, you know, you don't have to tell her everything. I mean, nothing really happened. We just... took a walk.
