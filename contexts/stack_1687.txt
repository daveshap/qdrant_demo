Altera has created EPCS and EPCQ devices, can only these be used to store FPGA configuration data? FPGA configuration data must be stored in external non-volatile memory. Can we use just any flash memory or only specific types? What about EEPROMs or any other nonvolatile memory device?Edit: I am referring to active configuration where the FPGA configures itself, by itself, without support of an external device like a microcontroller or microprocessor.
