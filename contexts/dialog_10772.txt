PATTERSON: All right- thee second embankment will go there.
STARLING: You do plan to mark it a bit more precisely than just- -there.""
PATTERSON: In your honor, Nigel. And you and Singh will be in charge of building them- and you'll also build the roadbeds and the three foundation pillars- and you'll be finished in eight thrilling weeks.
STARLING: John, it will not be easy.
PATTERSON: Nigel, you'll just have to use your hands-
PATTERSON: What are they looking at?
SAMUEL: You- they cannot believe you're still here.
PATTERSON: Nonsense.
SAMUEL: You don't know what Tsavo means, do you? It means slaughter"..."
HAWTHORNE: -then he feasted on him, starting with his feet-
STARLING: -please- you needn't be so graphic-
HAWTHORNE: You intend sorting this out" tonight?"
PATTERSON: I'll try- but this feels so different- that old lion I killed could never carry off a man Singh's size.
STARLING: But you said they were always old.
PATTERSON: That's what the books say...
PATTERSON: You were contracted to work-
ABDULLAH: -malaria epidemic; very sudden.
PATTERSON: Let me see the sick.
ABDULLAH: Oh, you're a doctor now, too?
PATTERSON: There is no reason for fear.
ABDULLAH: On that I choose to remain dubious. Two are dead now in two nights.
PATTERSON: Second death? Where?-
STARLING: -far end of camp- man wandering alone at night. Hawthorne's examining the body now. There's even less of him than of Singh.
PATTERSON: But it's crazy- the lion shouldn't be that hungry this soon. Samuel?
SAMUEL: We should construct thorn fences around every tent area. Fires burning at night.
PATTERSON: Fine. Get started. And a strict curfew- no one allowed out at night. Send half your men to the bridge, the rest with these two. And I'm sorry for my tone earlier. But I repeat- there is no reason for fear. I will kill the lion and I will build the bridge.
