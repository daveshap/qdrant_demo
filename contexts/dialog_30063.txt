ELIJAH: Now you're going to have to tell me more.
MEGAN: ...See my husband was a big football star in college and we were in an accident together. Our car flipped on an icy road. We were both injured. He couldn't play football anymore. If that hadn't happened, we wouldn't have been together.
ELIJAH: How so?
MEGAN: Football wasn't the kind of life I wanted... For ten years I'd be by the phone waiting for a call telling me he broke his neck in a practice game. And if it wasn't that call, it would be a call telling me he blew out his knee or suffered his third concussion. I've seen way too much of it in my job... I can barely take it when my clients are in pain. I don't hate the game. I admire the amount of skill it involved and, like everyone else, I was in awe of how he could play it, but I couldn't give him my heart and then have something happen to him. And it always does with that game. It's not a thing many people would understand.
ELIJAH: You and my mother would have a special connection.
MEGAN: Any way, fate stepped in and took football out of the equation.
ELIJAH: ...And everyone lived happily ever after.
