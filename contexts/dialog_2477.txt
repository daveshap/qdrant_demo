BRIAN: With grenadine, right?
JENNIFER: When I was twenty.
BRIAN: Oooh, very sophisticated. Having fun?
JENNIFER: Look, I'm not the same girl who had nothing better to do than wrap her legs around you on a Saturday night. This isn't about fun. I'm working here.
BRIAN: Carrying Swayzak's notebook?
JENNIFER: Let me tell you something. Martin Swayzak is going to be this town's next mayor.
BRIAN: Yeah. Swayzak. Humanity's last hope. How can you work for that guy?
JENNIFER: Why do you think Marty came here tonight? Because he cares about your department. You don't know how hard he works. You don't know about his programs helping West Side --
BRIAN: -- All I know is that his programs are getting firemen hurt.
JENNIFER: Bullshit. Marty's plan is only about efficiency. I've got two cousins on the job, you think I'd work for him if I didn't believe in it?
