Release of energy during electron jumps We took up the topic of particle nature of light recently.As the light is quantised when an electron jumps from higher to lower orbit it releases energy but as the energy is quantised it will release them in distinct packets.So while the electron is coming down:It's potential energy decreases as smooth fxn It releases a distinct amount of energy(as seen from its optical spectra)So the question arises what happens in between the jump.As the energy cant be released until it's sufficient to form a photon of corresponding energy,where does the energy go.Upon asking my teacher he said it's released as radiation as electron is accelerating.But then again radiation is released as photons.P.S.-I know elementary b.sc level maths and physics,so answers of appropriate level will be appreciated.
