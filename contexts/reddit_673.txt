How do I deal with feelings

I feel. I feel a LOT for this guy. I am also a guy. Do I ask him out/confess, or wait for him to make a move? (The rest is lowkey a rant) My feelings get so clouded, and I push away anything that could mean he reciprocates it. I have a lot of it, but I push it away so I don’t risk anything. He’s also one of my very best friends. I can’t read him, but maybe he does. He says he trusts me the most out of our friends, and we always plan things together. He wants me involved in his life, like his friends and gaming. He sends me memes and puts in a pretty good effort into our friendship. His eyes dilate when we talk but it could be the sun. I don’t know. I don’t want to risk our relationship either. We’re pretty close.. I don’t want to lose him as a friend. What do I do in this situation? And what do y’all think?
