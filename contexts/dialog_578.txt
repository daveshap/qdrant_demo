WADE: Then you accidentally see your body, or your face, or whatever, and you don't know who the hell it belongs to. Strange. It's the business with the old man, I know, and how incredibly pissed I was at him, and also chasing Jack Hewitt like that, and the Goddamned truck going through the ice, not to mention Margie's being so upset -- one thing on top of another.
ROLFE: Wade, are you alright?
WADE: But you gotta hear this. You won't believe it. Mel Gordon had come by to visit LaRiviere and so now I'm in his office.
LARIVIERE: He's on to us!
JACK: Shit! What are we gonna do?
LARIVIERE: Maybe I can buy him off. I gotta talk to Mel.
JACK: You can't buy Wade off.
LARIVIERE: We bought you.
JACK: That was me.
