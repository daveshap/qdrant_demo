WILLARD: How did we get here?
KURTZ: Because of all the things we do, the thing we do best -- is lie.
WILLARD: I think think a lie stinks.
KURTZ: Oh Captain, that is so true.
WILLARD: Stinks. I could never figure -- I could never figure how they can teach boys how to bomb villages with napalm -- and not let them write the word 'fuck' on their airplanes.
KURTZ: You could never figure it because it doesn't make sense.
WILLARD: Fuck no.
KURTZ: I'll tell you what makes sense ! Air strikes ! White Phosphorus ! Napalm ! We'll bomb the shit out of them if they don't do what we want.
WILLARD: We'll exterminate the fuckers !
