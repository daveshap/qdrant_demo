ARTIM: My father told me I shouldn't talk to you.
DATA: I understand.
ARTIM: I don't.
ARTIM: Not everyone here agrees with him. I mean, you know, about machines. There was even a big fight about it once. Do you like being a machine?
DATA: I aspire to be more than I am.
ARTIM: I know why. So people like us won't be afraid of you any more.
DATA: Perhaps, that is true.
ARTIM: Don't you ever get tired?
DATA: My power cells continually re- charge themselves.

ARTIM: Sometimes I do.
DATA: My legs are eighty-seven-point- two centimeters. They were eighty-seven-point-two centimeters the day I was created. They will be eighty- seven-point-two centimeters the day I go off line. My operation depends on specifications that do not change. I... cannot imagine... the experience of growing up or even tripping over my own feet...
ARTIM: But you've never had adults telling you what to do all the time... or bedtimes... or having to eat food you don't like...
DATA: I would gladly accept the requirement of a bedtime in exchange for knowing what it is like to be a child.
ARTIM: Do machines ever play?
DATA: I play the violin... and my chess routines are quite advanced...
ARTIM: No, I mean...
