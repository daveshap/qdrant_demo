I have a month left to edit my thesis.
I’m in the midst of writing my thesis for my MA in English. It just feels like a disorganized, amorphous blob right now and I’m panicked. I have so much left to do. I’ve been working as hard as I can on my draft on top of my regular TA work and course load. And I don’t even have a completed draft. I can’t stop beating myself uP about it. I’m working through my director’s revision notes and feeling defeated. 

I feel like I’m forcibly strong arming myself through these last few months, just trying to keep my head above water. Thank god for therapy. 

I guess that I’m just venting. Somebody out there tell me I’m gonna make it outta here alive!
