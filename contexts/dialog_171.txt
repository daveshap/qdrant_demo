JORDY: Hey, Chief, what are you doing here?
DUFFY: I came to see how the investigation was going. I called and you're not here. I wait up at the station and you don't even show up!!! I beep you - you don't return my call. Where the hell have you been?!
JORDY: Ladder 20 was on the Rock for training. We stopped there... so she could get cleaned up.
DUFFY: What do you mean, 'cleaned up?'
JORDY: I let her take a shower.
DUFFY: A shower!? Did you take one, too?
JORDY: No! Nothing happened.
DUFFY: Oh really. That's nice. You took a homicide witness to take a shower after your partner was shot? Are you out of your fucking mind?? Are you having that much trouble gettin' dates?!
