Well, I did it. I have a girlfriend.
I’ve been seeing her for little over 2 weeks, and we’re official as of yesterday.  I have no idea what I did to deserve her. I feel incredibly lucky to be her boyfriend. I must have done something right. 

Thank you to all of you in this subreddit. I couldnt have done it without your advice. I hope you find your one as well.
