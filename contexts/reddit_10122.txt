From student to professional
Hi everyone! 
First of all I would like to apologise for the mistakes I will commit in my writing. I'm spanish... :)

I am in an Animation and Video Game University and I am worried about the quality of my work. The topic can be aplied (I think) to most of the works but my case is easy to explain. 

I am not good enough yet to be a professional (I am in 2nd year) but some of my classmates are much better than me and I think they could already be hired in any company. I know that there are 2 years left but I don't think I will reach the requiered level I see in professional works. 

The thing is that I don't know how the professional world is. I don't know if, when you get hired, they provide you with some kind of training for you to reach a good level... I guess I am not the only one that will end the university with lower level than the requiered one so... 

Am I condemned to be always a bad artist?
