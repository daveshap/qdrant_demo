STIFLER: NOVA!!
OZ: Stifler!!
STIFLER: You coming to party tonight, Ostreicher, ya fuckface?
OZ: Depends if my date wants to stop by.
STIFLER: That junior chick?
OZ: Nah, gave her the Heisman. I'm working on something new.
STIFLER: Yeah right. I got an idea for something new. How 'bout you guys actually locate your dicks, remove the shrink wrap, and fuckin' use 'em.
OZ: Dude, it's gotta happen -- she's a college chick!
STIFLER: Bullshit. From where?
OZ: She works part-time at my dad's store.
STIFLER: Hah! Yeah, Oz, I bet it's more like your dad works at <u>her</u> store.
OZ: Dude, he does not.
