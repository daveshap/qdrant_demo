GEKKO: What do you say we go get a suite at the Carlyle? Caviar? Champagne? Celebrate, just like the old times Sunshine.
DARIEN: Those days are over, Gordon. They were over a long time ago.
GEKKO: Can't blame me for trying. You look as beautiful as that painting I just bought.
GEKKO: So what's the problem Sunshine? You look like Black Thursday. Bad case of puppy love?
DARIEN: It's not puppy love, Gordon. Anyway, Buddy and I are splitting up.
GEKKO: Sorry to hear that. I thought the kid had staying power.
DARIEN: It's over you, Gordon.
GEKKO: You told him about us?
DARIEN: No, are you crazy? And I don't want him ever to know. Do you understand?...
DARIEN: I want to ask you a big favor, Gordon. Please drop the Bluestar deal.
GEKKO: Now tell me, why would I want to do that?
DARIEN: Because I don't want to see him hurt.
GEKKO: Don't worry Sunshine. Bud and I had a little talk. We came to an understanding. I want you to go back to him. Soothe him. Help keep his head straight. Okay?
DARIEN: I can't...and I won't.
GEKKO: Come on, we both like Buddy. But this bleeding heart puppy love act is over the top... It doesn't fit.
DARIEN: Maybe it does. Don't patronize me Gordon.
GEKKO: You and I are the same, Darien. We're smart enough not to buy into the oldest myth running: love... A fiction created by people who got nothing to keep them from jumping out of windows.
DARIEN: You're really twisted, Gordon. You're incapable of giving to anybody because deep down inside you there's a poverty that every last dollar in the world won't fill.
GEKKO: Ooh ooh, tough talk from a scared little girl all wrapped in a pretty grown-up package. Does this mean you're ready to cut the umbilical cord and step out into the world on your own? Because, Darien, if you're through with me, you're through with everything I'm a part of.
