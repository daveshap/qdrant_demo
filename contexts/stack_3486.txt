Can location/owner of mobile phone be identified Let's say someone uses GSM network mobile phone to pursue his/her online activities on social networking platforms. The mobile phone is Android and all online activities are done through a VPN tunnel (Droid VPN). Posit He/She runs a Facebook account that cannot be identified whose account is it in person.Can the origin/owner (by tracing mobile phone number/ location) be identified by anyone tracing that social platform or mobile activities? If yes how that can be thwarted?Scenario example:CellX(a GSM mobile phone) is on BTSY (network tower under which cellX resides). On May 6, 2018 at 24:30:02:2034 owner of cellX posted on Facebook and BTSY adds timestamp, IME, apps that generated that packets, geolocation, destination of the packets etc. Authority later collects all packets between 24:30:02:2034-5 seconds  and 24:30:02:2034+5 seconds i.e. timestamp filter.From those packets authority applies further filters like geolocation (of suspicious places) and more filters just to track the original poster. Likewise more filter to be applied utill the poster is pinpointed! All these processes are done while the authority is unaware of the content of the packets due to encryption, let alone if the authority is able to decrypt the packets! Could you suggest a way of being pseudonymous?
