GENERAL BIZIMUNGU: You know what the Scottish call it?
PAUL: No.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU: Ishca Baha - the water of life. I went on a tour once of the finest single malt distillery in the world. Have you ever been to Scotland?
PAUL: No, sir.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU: Wonderful country, wonderful golf. I wonder - will I ever go back? What do you think?
PAUL: I hope we all get to do many things. Can we go now?
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU: Pack those carefully, put them in my jeep, and guard them.
PAUL: Please, General, call and put your policemen back at the gate.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU: I am going to do you a great favor. I am going to take you with us to Gitarama.
PAUL: I do not want to go to Gitarama, General.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU: You cannot go back to the hotel. The crazy men are going there now. Better to come with me.
