LEON: Come, sweetheart. Let me put it on you. You will teach these jewels. For the first time they will learn how they can look.
NINOTCHKA: They belong to the people.
LEON: I give them back to the people... I make you Ninotchka the Great... Duchess of the People!... Grand Duchess of the People!
NINOTCHKA: Is this the wish of the masses?
LEON: It is their wish.
NINOTCHKA: Thank you, Leon... thank you, masses. Can I make a speech now?
LEON: Please.
NINOTCHKA: Comrades! People of the world! The revolution is on the march... I know... wars will wash over us... bombs will fall... all civilization will crumble... but not yet, please... wait, wait... what's the hurry? Let us be happy... give us our moment.... We are happy, aren't we, Leon?
LEON: Yes, sweetheart.
NINOTCHKA: So happy and so tired.
