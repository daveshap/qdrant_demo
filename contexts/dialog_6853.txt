SEBASTIAN: Need a lift?
ANNETTE: No thank you.
SEBASTIAN: How are you today?
ANNETTE: Give it up.
SEBASTIAN: Oh right, last night. I guess I owe you an apology.
ANNETTE: I'm not going to speak to you till you realize that you can't intimidate me.
SEBASTIAN: I said I was sorry.
ANNETTE: It was fine.
SEBASTIAN: I wish I could say the same for myself. I was up thinking about you all night.
ANNETTE: I thought we agreed that we were going to be friends.
SEBASTIAN: Yes, well unfortunately I can't just switch the on" button to "off." The sad fact of the matter is that you've unintentionally rubbed off on me."
ANNETTE: And that's a bad thing?
SEBASTIAN: I'm trying to better myself, but the one person who can help me is the same one pushing me away.
ANNETTE: I'm sorry, but I'm not here to be your savior.
SEBASTIAN: Well try this one on for size. I think I'm falling in love with you.
ANNETTE: You don't even know me.
SEBASTIAN: Don't you believe in love at first sight?
ANNETTE: Yes, but only when it's mutual. And this is far from mutual.
SEBASTIAN: Ouch. Do you think we could spend some time together this morning?
ANNETTE: I can't. I'm seeing a friend.
SEBASTIAN: Who?
ANNETTE: That's none of your business.
SEBASTIAN: How about tonight?
ANNETTE: I'm busy.
SEBASTIAN: Doing what?
ANNETTE: That's also none of your business.
SEBASTIAN: Tell me what to do, Annette. How can I win your heart. I'll do anything. I can't get you out of my mind.
ANNETTE: You truly want to do something to make me happy?
SEBASTIAN: Yes.
ANNETTE: And you promise to abide by it?
SEBASTIAN: Without question.
ANNETTE: Alright. I want you to leave and go back to New York.
SEBASTIAN: What?
ANNETTE: If that's a problem, then I'll make arrangements to stay with some friends.
SEBASTIAN: I'll leave this afternoon. Happy?
ANNETTE: It's not about being happy. You and I can't -
GREG: He told you he's failing in love with you? I've never known him to say those words before.
ANNETTE: Really? I thought he said it all the time.
GREG: That's not his style. one thing I can say about Valmont. He always speaks the truth.
ANNETTE: Nothing.
GREG: Is there a mutual feeling between you two?
ANNETTE: No. I mean. I don't know. What else do you know about him?
GREG: Not a whole lot. We take some classes together. He's got a bad rep, but it's mostly bullshit.
ANNETTE: What do you mean?
GREG: Well, a lot of people are jealous cause he's loaded.
ANNETTE: I don't know. I've been hearing some awful things about him.
GREG: From who?
ANNETTE: I can't tell you. I'm sworn to secrecy.
GREG: Annette, how long have we known each other?
ANNETTE: Forever.
GREG: Now it's my job to look out for you. You're like a kid sister to me. Do I look like some kind of gossip queen?
ANNETTE: You promise not to say anything?
GREG: On my mother's life.
ANNETTE: Okay...
