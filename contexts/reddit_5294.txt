I fear taking a gap year in case I do not find work. Any ways of boosting my chances?
 

I want to take a gap year before uni but I think spending a year of education and focusing on something else will be really helpful for my mental health, whilst also teaching me practical skills like budgeting and hopefully stuff relevant in chemical sciences because that is a loose way of describing the bachelors I am applying for.

I currently have my final college year to go until this proposed gap year. As stated my one fear is that I don't find work and ultimately just spend a year doing nothing. I have a part time job as a kitchen porter right now but is there anything else I can do to boost my chances?
