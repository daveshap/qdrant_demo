Advice on how to keep a fast food job. My low self esteem has gotten me a warning from my boss
I'm currently in the trial period for an entry level job at a fast food. Never worked this field before but i'm motivated and ready to give myself 100% in it as it finances my future. But my self esteem is so low right now that my boss has talked to me about the returns he had so far, how i'm uneased with lots of customers and the other workes constantly have to tell me what to do. 

On that latter point, i disagreed. For example they are telling me there are plates to bring, but i saw them. I'm just finishing what i'm currently doing before taking them to the customer. I'm always keeping an eye on every station in case there is something that needs to be done, but i'm still slow as i'm more focused on doing things properly rather than quickly rn. 

I feel like shit right now, if i lose this job i will have nothing left to do during the summer. Plus there will be the humiliating fact of not having been able to keep an entry level job.

I4m at a loss. What should i do ? How can i improve my social skills and have the self esteem needed to actually say what i need to say and do what i need to do quicker ?

Thanks you for your answers. I'm ready to give any other info in the comments if needed.
