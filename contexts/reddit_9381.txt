Paid off all credit card debt - thanks to Christmas bonus and NerdWallet
I am so excited right now and I don't want to wake anyone in my life up but I need to tell someone. A few months ago, I decided to take my credit card debt seriously and figure out how to tackle this beast. I did some research (thank you, Nerd Wallet!) and realized how badly I was getting ripped off with a 21% interest rate on my credit card. I called them more than once and they refused to give me a better deal, so I opened up a new 0% APR on balance transfers with a different company and made myself a payment plan to pay it down. Without all that extra interest tacked on, I was able to come up with a feasible deadline for myself to pay it off. Then SURPRISE, I get a Christmas bonus from my full-time job and was able to pay it off this morning.

A little back story for why I ended up with the debt in the first place - I was in a really bad relationship that ended in 2017, lasted 2 years - he decided to take a year off to figure out what he wanted to do with his life and essentially forced to me to pay all the bills for both us, on top of lending him money. I had so much money saved up that all disappeared in this disaster of a relationship, and got even worse when I ended up relying on my credit card to get by. Well that was a big mistake! 

But this story has a happy ending. Lesson learned. Now to tackle the big one - student loans (which I've been paying down this whole time, just in small income-based increments). Good luck to anyone out there struggling with the same thing!
