SUSAN: It's true! I was here last year doing a piece, remember? I was in the bar with all these Northern trade unionists and their sponsored MPs.

They wouldn't let me buy drinks even when I told them the programme was paying. They kept looking at my pass which was pinned here and saying 'Oo, can I?'
JEREMY: Then one of them was sick all over your new dress.
