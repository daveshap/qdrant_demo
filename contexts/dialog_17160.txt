ANDY: Please! You've GOT to let me take the classes! It's how I keep myself BALANCED!!
YOGI: It is apparently not working.
ANDY: So HELP ME! All I wanna do is MEDITATE!!
YOGI: Andy, don't raise your voice. We don't wish your presence here.
ANDY: Go away.
LYNNE: It's me.
ANDY: Oh, it's open.
LYNNE: I brought you Haagen Dazs. Chocolate.
ANDY: I don't deserve Haagen Daz. I'm a horrible person.
LYNNE: Andy, you're not horrible. You're just... complicated.
ANDY: You don't know the real me.
LYNNE: Andy... there is no real you.
