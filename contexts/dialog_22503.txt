EARL: I tell you it was a miracle the way things turned out --
BOOTH: I don't want to hear about miracles and God and all that! We tried to murder someone to cover our asses!
EARL: Well we didn't kill him, he died on his own.
BOOTH: Look. Dwayne was right. This is going to be a big story. So big in fact that I don't want to even have this money around.
EARL: Fair enough, I'll take it to my place.
BOOTH: Forget it. We're going to bury it, and we're not going to even think about it until everything dies down. And no one, I mean no one hears a word about it.	 Understand?
