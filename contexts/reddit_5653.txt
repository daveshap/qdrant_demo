Find job or wait it out a few months?
So I recently got laid off. I've been strongly debating wether to look for another job soon or wait it out a bit. If I were to choose the latter option, I would study some certification in my field (IT) to increase my employability when I return to the job market. I spoke with my office of unemployment to see if I would qualify for financial assistance in taking online courses; I am setup to meet with a counselor this week. I live with a high risk person for Covid-19 and I am concerned about returning to work right away as the state I live in kinda has a lax attitude about precautions. Also, Unemployment with the CARES act would be paying me more than returning to work at the moment (2-3 months). So it's basically get paid more to be safe while getting some additional education under my belt.  Honestly, if it wasn't for the virus, I wouldn't even care about these incentives and I would just return to work. However, I'm worried about this possibly being a worse decision than if I joined the job market right away and my 'too good to be true' sense is tingling. Is there something I'm not seeing here or what would you do in my position?
