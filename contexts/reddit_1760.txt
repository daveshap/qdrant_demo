How I know I'm ugly
So far, every school I've been accepted to is a school I haven't visited in person.

Furthermore, every school that's rejected me is a school I traveled to and toured.

I think the admissions officers saw me and was like "damn, he ugly" and threw my application out. Feels bad man.
