Turning Off Automatic Brightness in Ubuntu 17.10 Just updated my install of Ubuntu to 17.10 today. The brightness keeps setting itself randomly. It'll either shut off the screen, or put it about halfway up. This is incredibly frustrating as I like to work a minimum brightness. Is there anyway I can turn this feature off?I've looked through the Preferences->power manager menu, but I've already set it to do nothing while my laptop is plugged in. I don't know the source of the problem, so I haven't been able to look through the terminal to fix anything.Thanks for the help!
