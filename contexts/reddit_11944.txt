I make everyone laugh, but i'm alone.
Everything I say makes people laugh, so they must enjoy my company, but I am still left in the dust. Could it be because I speak too much? Sometimes I feel like that must hinder myself because it ends up making me look silly. I'll say something that is self-deprecating, for example. Which I don't mind because I like to make people happy. But perhaps that is the problem. Maybe they don't respect me and such. 

I imagine if I am leaving everything out there with girls that isn't good either. Sure I know everyone which they must be attracted to but I feel like if I say the occasional dumb thing or use self-deprecating humor they'll be less likely to be interested. 

Maybe it also stops people from taking me seriously. I imagine that makes it bad for myself. I have a very serious side to myself, but I only show it when a person needs advice or on an intellectual topic. So perhaps people just never bring that stuff up to me, which makes up half of a relationship with a human being and thus it makes us less than friends. 

I am just frustrated because everyone seems to like me, and I know a lot of people, but I tend to sit alone eating at the dining hall at college. I sit home a lot on the weekends too. 

I also feel like perhaps my ridiculous attitude towards things is hindering my success in general. I  never get work done and perhaps if I took things a bit more seriously, my work would get done. 

I just feel like I have so much to say, but I should just start saying less so I avoid the duds and the awkward/lame ones that might be frowned upon. Perhaps people would respect me more and desire to get to know me more if I wasn't so forward.
