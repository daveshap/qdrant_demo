OLEG: Oh, shit. I hate looking at that!
EMIL: Don't want to film this?
DAPHNE: Now I become custody of police department?
JORDY: If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they'll help you with your situation.
DAPHNE: I will if they don't send me back.
JORDY: They won't until this is over.
DAPHNE: Are you married?
JORDY: Divorced.
DAPHNE: Do you live alone? I've been in these clothes since...the killings. Could we stop at your place? I could take a shower...before I go into custody?
JORDY: I can't take you to my place.
DAPHNE: Somewhere else?
