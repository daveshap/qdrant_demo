Quit job with no backup plan, landed job in less than 3 months - Here's what worked for me
(throwaway because there might be identifying stuff on my other account)

I'm a writer in my mid-20s who got involved with a content mill. I've only been out of college for a couple years and this was my first grown-up job. It turned out to be a really toxic environment.

I burnt out in less than a year. I made a big decision to take a leap of faith and quit with nothing lined up, because I knew I didn't have the time or energy at that job to look for new work. I had about 6 months of money saved.

That was only 2.5 months ago. I just got a new professional, full-time job in my field that I actually wanted, with a salary and benefits I'm THRILLED about. 

I know part of the equation is luck, but I wanted to share some thoughts on what I think helped the process be (relatively) quick and easy. Hopefully it will help some of you.

- I DIDN'T apply to every job listing I saw in my field. **Over 2.5 months, I applied to maybe 30 jobs at the most, probably fewer**. Most people go for quantity of applications, but I focused on finding listings that I *really* thought fit my skills and experience and that I had a good chance at. 

- **Every single cover letter I sent was customized**. I started from scratch with each one. Previously, I had used a cover letter that was a form letter, more or less, just inserting the company's name and the position title where appropriate. This method is one reason I didn't send a lot of applications: each one took me a fair amount of time to put together. I would write them with the job description at my side so that I could hit the different points in the ad.

- I do have a relatively strong resume (internship experience, freelancing experience, brief stint in marketing aka the content mill), but **I emphasized qualities that you don't necessarily get from jobs or education**. I focused on the fact that I am a reliable and organized person with strong communication skills, and this was what seemed to resonate with most of the people that called me back, not that fact that I worked at such-and-such place.

- Cover letters had very little to do with my resume. The only references to my resume were contextual - more like, "I happened to be here when I showed this quality off especially well."

- In the case of the job I got, **I wrote the reasons I wanted to work at the particular job** (it's an area of interest, I admire [specific thing they do], etc.). Manager seemed impressed and brought it up at the interview.

- **I woke up at 8 every day, but I didn't always work an 8-hour day**. Some days I did job search stuff all day, but others I didn't because there just weren't enough positions I found that I wanted to apply to.  On those days, I worked on freelancing or sending emails to people I'd be interested in working with someday. I went to coffee with mentors, visited friends, worked on getting my life back (I had been really depressed working at the other job). Sometimes I watched puppy videos, because sometimes you just need to veg.

- During the interview at my new job especially, I made a point of making eye contact, smiling and being relaxed. I laughed. I made a couple jokes. I wanted to be at my most personable and make a connection.

- **When addressing why I quit a job after less than a year with no backup** I didn't give any real details. You don't have to, and I clearly blew one interview earlier in this stint of unemployment by letting myself talk too much (it was a PR job and I accidentally, in my rambling, said something about wanting to get away from marketing. The fields are similar. Whoops). I said I wanted to move on to pursue new opportunities, such as something in [area of media this job is in].

- I made sure to give all my references a heads-up, and to choose them carefully. After I was hired, the director told me she was "floored" by the references I received. **Make connections with people who will really go to bat for you, and then stay in touch with those people**. I'm sending them all "thank you" cards.

NETWORK NETWORK NETWORK. **If I hadn't stayed in touch and on good terms with my references, I might not have this job. I really felt like the references clinched it for me**. Get coffee with your old professors. Have lunch with your boss. Message your former classmates on Facebook who are in your field and check up on them. People will help you if you reach out.

I know this was long, and some of it might seem a bit obvious, but it wasn't all obvious to me the first times I applied for jobs. I was really scared that quitting my other job would doom me to a very lengthy job search, but I ended up feeling completely refreshed and finding a job I actually want to do. I also believe that in my mental state while working at the content mill, I wouldn't have given a very strong interview or had time to write more tailored cover letters.

I hope everyone's job search goes well and that maybe this post will help someone just a little.

For the record, I know quitting a job with no fallback plan is not for everyone and isn't technically a wise decision, but it ended up being the best thing for me in my case.
