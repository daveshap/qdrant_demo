"I don't want to just fuck, but I also don't want a relationship"
I mean, that's cool, I guess, but I don't buy it.

I do believe some people probably have healthy, functional, non-committed relationships. But, I also believe a lot of people (In my case, guys), who are looking for a non-committed relationship online are full of shit. 

Yesterday, I asked a guy what was he looking for after having talked for a bit, and he basically said that he wanted someone he could go to the movies with, eat out, go on dates and have sex,  but not dating seriously.

To me, this just strikes me as "I want someone who will be in a pseudo relationship with me, but without any sort of emotional responsibility and commitment from my part".

Obviously, after I discussed things with him, he threw in the "I'm open to a serious relationship with the right person and if things go well between us", which in my experience, is a complete lie. 

There's a huge difference for me between getting to know someone slowly and see where it goes vs. the pseudo relationship with no commitment these men want. 

I think this sentence is thrown out to reel you in, and make you think there's hope it will develop into something later, but it most likely never will.

If you are looking for a serious relationship, or actually getting to know people, don't fall for this bullshit. It leads nowhere. If a guy says he wants nothing serious, believe him. Even if he acts like he loves you, and takes you on dates. Even if you meet his family. When you ask him where this is going, or if he wants something more, he will deny everything and act like you are crazy, but will try to convince you to stay. 

State your needs and wants, don't settle for anything less. Don't think you'll change his mind, don't waste your time.
