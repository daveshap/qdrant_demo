GEORGE: A fine trick! Smart, aren't you? What a pack of lies you told us about those porters! Of course the minute they arrive, we can make arrangements to leave. If they take us. But you knew very well you'd tell them not to!
CHANG: Now, my dear boy. You shouldn't—
GEORGE: You've been lying to us ever since we got here! Apparently it's worked with some people. Perhaps it's because they lack the courage to do anything about it. But not me, Chang. You're up against the wrong man. I'll get out of here, if I have to blow this fantastic place into the valley! I'll get out—porters or no porters!
CHANG: You must prevail upon him not to attempt the journey. He could never get through that country alive.
CONWAY: I can't let him go alone. It's suicide!
LAMA: Yes, of course, your brother is a problem. It was to be expected.
CONWAY: I knew you'd understand. That's why I came to you for help.
LAMA: You must not look to me for help. Your brother is no longer my problem. He is now your problem, Conway.
CONWAY: Mine?
LAMA: Because, my son, I am placing in your hands the future and destiny of Shangri-La. For I am going to die.
