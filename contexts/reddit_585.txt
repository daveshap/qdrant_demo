Hoe do I respond to learning about someone's depression?
There's been multiple instances where I have learned that a friend is depressed or something similar and and I honestly don't know how to react. I've noticed I'm not the only one too. I overheard someone telling their (and my) friend that she had cut herself. My friend just responded, "oh... don't do that." I was thinking, "that was a really horrible response", but at the same time, I don't know what I would've said that's better. Glad the girl at least had someone she could vent to though
