EDDIE: I'm gonna kill you.
WELLES: Don't bore me with that bullshit.
EDDIE: How'd you find me here?
WELLES: Don't ask questions.
EDDIE: Fuck you!
WELLES: Starting to recognize a pattern?
EDDIE: What do you want?
WELLES: Who is Machine?
EDDIE: I don't know...
WELLES: I want his name.
EDDIE: I told you, I don't know.
WELLES: I will never get tired of hurting you, Eddie, so you might want to change your attitude.
EDDIE: What the fuck am I gonna protect that freak for? He was Dino's boy, not mine. He shows up with his mask on, leaves with his mask on. Nobody knows.
WELLES: Okay, we'll come back to that. So, six years ago a guy contacts you, through the classifieds, over the phone, however he does it. It's Longdale, looking for a snuff film. And you, entrepreneur that you are, tell him you can hook him up.
EDDIE: Yeah, the fucking lawyer.
WELLES: Told him you could get him a snuff film.
EDDIE: Yeah.
WELLES: How much did he pay you?
EDDIE: Thirty thousand each, that fucking cocksucker.
WELLES: That's all? Thirty each. That's all it took for you to murder her?
EDDIE: It was a lot of fucking money.
WELLES: So... you brought Dino in, and he brought Machine. And, one day, a girl walked into your office because you had an ad in the paper for models. And she never walked out.
EDDIE: Something like that.
WELLES: What did you do, knock her out, shoot her up... ?
EDDIE: What the fuck do you want from me?
WELLES: I want to know. I want to know exactly what you did to her!
EDDIE: Fuck you then, you want to know? I talked her up, told her how beautiful she was, told her she was gonna be a star. I told her I was gonna get her a screen test, and while I'm doing that, I got her a soda and dropped a mickey. When it was dark enough, I rang Dino and told him it was go time, I put her in the trunk of my car and we went and we fucking did it. That's what happened. She's dead. She's been dead a long fucking time. Nobody fucking cares!
