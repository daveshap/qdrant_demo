I feel stupid for even asking this lol
I don’t use Reddit that much, so i don’t even know if this is the right place to post it, but this is a small sub, so I’m pretty confident that no one will find this. Anyways:
I dated this guy for a short period of time (not even a full year) but we were really close friends prior to our dating.  I was absolutely in love with him, and I would say he was definitely my best friend. And he felt the same, or at least he said he did. But I completely fucked it up. I have a lot that is wrong with me, extreme depression and anxiety, abandonment issues , borderline personality disorder, you know the type. And this caused me to be really distant and confusing in our relationship. No matter how much I told myself that he loved me, my brain told me that I could never be loved. Even though i knew that he only had feelings for me, i was extremely, extremely jealous of everyone he talked to, not just girls, all of his friends, boys included.Thats not to say he was a saint, but I’m almost positive that most of our problems stemmed from my insecurities. But I can genuinely say that i was in the worst place when we dated. But now im not. And neither is he. And i feel like an absolute fool for wasting my chance with the guy of my dreams. Im on better meds now, going to therapy, and just trying really hard to love myself. I am going across the country for the entirety of my summer vacation, and i plan to continue to work on myself in a superficial way ya know, just like losing weight, stuff that will make me more comfortable and confident in my body. So i guess here’s the question: would it be stupid of me to ask to reconnect with him when i come back from vacation. We’ve been broken up for awhile, and there’s still a lot of time for growth between now and when i plan on asking him. Idk, i just really miss him. We’ve both grown a lot and I want another chance...is that stupid?

TLDR i guess; should i ask to reconnect with my ex?
