You can get a CDL in a few weeks for a few thousand dollars and start earning a decent salary. What other certifications can you get fast and affordable like that? What other alternatives are there to truck driving that dont require college or over $10,000?
Im tired of working at walmart. Ill get my CDL if i cant find anything else but im trying to see what other options I have
