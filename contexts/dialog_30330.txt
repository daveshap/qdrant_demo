SCOTTIE: But the small scenes, the fragments in the mirror: you remember them.
MADELEINE: Vaguely...
SCOTTIE: What do you remember?
MADELEINE: A room... there is a room, and I sit there alone... always alone...
SCOTTIE: Would you know the room?
MADELEINE: No... it's in shadow.
SCOTTIE: What else?
MADELEINE: A grave...
SCOTTIE: Where?
MADELEINE: I don't know. An open grave. I stand by the gravestone looking down into it. And it's my grave.
SCOTTIE: How do you know?
MADELEINE: I know.
SCOTTIE: There's a name on the gravestone.
MADELEINE: No. It's new and clean, and waiting.
SCOTTIE: What else?
MADELEINE: This part is dream, I think. There is a tower and a bell and... a garden below... but it seems to be in Spain... a village in Spain. And then it clicks off, and is gone.
SCOTTIE: A portrait? Do you ever see a portrait?
MADELEINE: No.
SCOTTIE: Of the woman in the mirror. Would you know her if you saw her?
MADELEINE: But I'm the woman in the mirror!
SCOTTIE: No!
SCOTTIE: If I could find the key... find the beginning put it together...
MADELEINE: And so explain it away? But there is a way to explain it, you see. If I'm mad? That would explain it, wouldn't it?
