PSA: What's wrong with posting a general "People care about you, please don't kill yourself" message?
We've been seeing an increase in this type of submission at SW lately.  You may not have noticed, because we have removed most of them, but we've missed a couple and received some understandable complaints.

First of all, if you have been helped by seeing one of these messages at a critical time in your life, that is wonderful.  But if that's the case, **it helped you because you believed it**.  Sadly, that's not how it works for many of the most at-risk people struggling with suicidal thoughts.  

This is why, in our [talking tips post](http://redd.it/igh87) we say: 

> Don't disagree with suicidal people about how bad things are.  It’s not about their circumstances; it’s about their suffering, and you can’t measure that from the outside.  **A message that** ***in any way*** **tries to tell or show the suicidal person that “it’s not so bad” is just another way of saying “I don't understand what you’re going through”.**  

For our OPs who are in the lowest and most dangerous state of mind, simply seeing one of these message can make their sense of alienation and failure worse, because they are not remotely able to believe that it's true *for them*.  Anything  meant to be universally "uplifting", including the overuse of the "It Gets Better" message, which originated in the specific context that adults aren't usually as emotionally immature as teenagers, tends to backfire.

We know that these posts come from people who truly want to help.  Perhaps they think that, if they only have time to write one message, they can do the most good by reaching out in a general way to many people.  That assumption is refuted by all the best experimental and clinical data that we have.  (Please see the references in the [talking tips post](http://redd.it/igh87) if you're interested in the details.)

If you only have time to write one message here, sort by "New" and pick an OP who doesn't have many good responses on their thread, and respond to them, directly and personally.  If you don't know what to say, that's what the [talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) are for!

You will still help many people!  A lot of our most distressed people lurk for a long time before posting, and what we hear from them over and over again is that what finally helped them get up the courage to post was seeing this type of empathetic and *individualized* response.  

Edit: typos, added the origin of "It Gets Better".
