WENDY: Boy, we must be really high up. The air feels so different.
JACK: Uh...huh.
DANNY: Dad?
JACK: Yes?
DANNY: I'm hungry.
JACK: Well you should have eaten your breakfast.
WENDY: We'll get something as soon as we get to the hotel, okay?
DANNY: Okay, Mom.
WENDY: Hey, wasn't it around here that the Donner party got snowbound?
JACK: I think that was farther west in the Sierras.
DANNY: What was the Donner party?
JACK: There were a party of settlers in the covered wagon times. They got snowbound one winter in the mountains. They had to resort to cannabilism in order to stay alive.
DANNY: You mean they ate each other up?
JACK: They had to, in order to survive.
WENDY: Jack...
DANNY: Don't worry, Mom. I know all about cannabilism, I saw it on T.V.
