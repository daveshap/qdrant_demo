PRINCESS: You will die! It will be awful!
WALLACE: Every man dies. Not every man really lives.
PRINCESS: Drink this! It will dull your pain.
WALLACE: It will numb my wits, and I must have them all. If I'm senseless, or if I wail, then Longshanks will have broken me.
PRINCESS: I can't bear the thought of your torture. Take it!
PRINCESS: I have come to beg for the life of William Wallace.
EDWARD: You fancy him.
PRINCESS: I respect him. At worst he was a worthy enemy. Show mercy... Oh thou great king... and win the respect of your own people.
