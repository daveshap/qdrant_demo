LIZ: Eat alone, gotta read. Social defense tactic 17 Peter, that jacket is foul. Lose your glasses?
PETER: Hi, Adele.
LIZ: Brrr. It's colder than New Hampshire in here.
PETER: I'm sure you kept warm.
ADELE: Sexual tension...
LIZ: Oh, beware of jealousy, my lord, the green-eyed monster...
PETER: Don't misquote Othello at me. Besides, you'd have to care about somebody to strangle them.
LIZ: What's your problem?
PETER: I've got no problems.
ADELE: Time to get my bowling ball re drilled.
LIZ: Peter Parker, you have no idea what I did this weekend. Or didn't do. It's no business of yours either way.
LIZ: Sit down and stop being such a child.
PETER: This from a girl who still plays with dolls.
LIZ: That wasn't clever. That was just nasty.
