LOUIS: Oh, Dana, it's you ...
DANA: Hi, Louis.
LOUIS: ... I thought it was the drug store.
DANA: Are you sick, Louis?
LOUIS: Oh, no, I feel great. I just ordered some more vitamins. I see you were exercising. So was I. I taped 20 Minute Workout" and played it back at high speed so it only took ten minutes and I got a really good workout. You wanna have a mineral water with me?"
DANA: No thanks, Louis. I'm really tired. I've been rehearsing all morning.
LOUIS: Okay. I'll take a raincheck. I always have plenty of mineral water and other nutritious health foods, but you know that. Listen, that reminds me, I'm having a party for all my clients. It's gonna be my fourth anniversary as an accountant. I know you fill out your own tax return, but I'd like you to come being that you're my next door neighbor and all ...
DANA: Oh, that's nice, Louis. I'll stop by if I'm around.
LOUIS: You know you shouldn't leave your TV on so loud when you go out. That creep down the hall phoned the manager.
DANA: I thought I turned it off. I guess I forgot.
