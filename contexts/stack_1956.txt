Is there another word for something that is conjured besides a conjuration? I have this feeling there is a word for the product of a conjuring related to the word conjure. Obviously it\u2019s not conjugations, but that\u2019s what my brain wants to say. It may not be strictly related to the word conjure itself either, but simply directly related to a conjuring. Sentence: <blockquote>  The ______ of last night\u2019s conjuring still danced around the house. </blockquote>
