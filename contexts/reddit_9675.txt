First book/article/video recommendation for someone interested in a student affairs grad program?
There’s so many books out there and I’m trying to pick something (doesn’t have to be a traditional book) to pick up first to give me an introduction into the profession, including the types of positions available and maybe issues and why I might want to enter this profession.

What should I start with?
