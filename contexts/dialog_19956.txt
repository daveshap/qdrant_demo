ELLEN: If that little weasel ever walked in here I wouldn't serve him.
BETTY: I'd slap his face.
ELLEN: I'd kick him in the nuts, if I thought he had any.
ELLEN: Where you headed, Betty?
BETTY: Los Angeles, California.
ELLEN: And you called your friend, and she's telling you not to go? When I went to Europe my friends told me I was crazy.
BETTY: Europe? The Europe? This is my first time out of Kansas.
ELLEN: I should call you Dorothy. When I left here I went straight to Italy. Everybody told me not to go. But I wanted to go to Rome ever since I saw Audrey Hepburn in Roman Holiday
BETTY: Did you love it?
ELLEN: Sure I loved it! It was great.
ELLEN: Let me tell you something. I got groped by these Tunisian guys who thought I was a slut for wearing shorts, it was hotter than stink the whole time, and I got some kind of weird gum disease from the water. Plus, it ended my marriage --
BETTY: That's horrible!
ELLEN: No, he was a toad. Even more of a toad than Merle... I just wear the ring to keep the flies away. Rome was the best thing I ever did, because I DID IT! And I swear to you, it changed me. I've been to Rome, Italy! I sat every morning at the Cafe Sistina and had my cappuccino, and watched the pilgrims walk to mass, and no one can ever take that away from me.
BETTY: I left my husband two days ago.
ELLEN: Really?
BETTY: I'm getting back with my ex-fianc. He proposed to me right around here, so I guess this is just sort of a sentimental stop...
ELLEN: Wait, I thought you said you'd never been outta Kansas...
BETTY: Oh. I mean, except for that. Yep. I'm trading in a car dealer for a heart specialist, so that's pretty good...
ELLEN: Nice move. Cedars Sinai?
BETTY: No. Loma Vista.
ELLEN: I s'pose his name's David Ravell.
BETTY: How did you know?
ELLEN: What's his real name?
BETTY: Dr. David Ravell.
ELLEN: You mean... George McCord, the actor?
BETTY: No, I mean David Ravell. He's a surgeon.
