Can I add USB outlets to bath/hall lighting circuit box (not GFCI)? My bathroom, inside near door, has a 2-gang box, containing 2 light switches, powering combination ceiling light and fan. This box is fed by hallway lighting circuit, and the work box is not covered by GFCI.The changes I want to make are:Exchange both switches with a \"2 horizontal switch\" device, freeing up a gang (example: Leviton 5634-W)Install a USB-ONLY outlet (example: Leviton USB4P)My question is whether this change is \"to code\" (NEC)? I am in Northeast USA (NH).For completeness: My bathroom electrical outlets ARE on a different circuit, in a different work box, and yes that is protected by GFCI. The question is about adding a USB \"outlet\" to an area that normally requires all outlets to be GFI. My understanding is what I plan would be OK because these are low-voltage.
