LLOYD: Maybe it's this mix tape I made you. Or maybe these flowers. He gives Jessica the flowers and tape.
JESSICA: Uh, thanks. God I'm so excited! So, are you ready to take me to the principal's office? He whips out the key, she takes it.
LLOYD: So no small talk? Good, 'cause I don't know how to make that. Yep. Small talk. Not for me. Not a fan. Got any hobbies? How 'bout this weather?
