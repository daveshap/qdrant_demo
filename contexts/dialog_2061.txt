RATH: Don't know. That's how it works.
KETCHAM: That's what our General Contractor told us but how can you trust someone like that?
RATH: Right.
KETCHAM: I thought that I would be thinking about Margaret, or work, or that I'd be having these deep, profound and depressing thoughts but I'm not. I'm trying to think really profound thoughts, but I can't. It seems very funny to me.
RATH: What are you thinking about?
KETCHAM: I'm thinking about Moonpies. Ain't that funny? I haven't had a Moonpie since I was ten years old. Right now, I'm thinking how much I'd love one.
RATH: And an R.C.
KETCHAM: Can I ask you something?
RATH: Go ahead.
KETCHAM: What do other guys do?
RATH: Everyone handles it differently. Some are ready, some are not.
KETCHAM: Do they get down on their knees, begging and crying?
RATH: Some.
KETCHAM: When I thought about this, that was always there, in the back of my head, that image of me on my knees, crying. It wouldn't go away and it would really upset me. It was something that I could never get away from... but now, I feel it's okay. I feel good.
RATH: Can I ask you a question?
KETCHAM: Anything.
RATH: Why didn't you fade?
KETCHAM: You mean quit?
RATH: Yeah.
KETCHAM: I used to think about it. I had Margaret. She wanted kids. I thought about moving somewhere far away like, Europe. I could see all of that, the first part, the getting away but I couldn't see that next part. 'Then what?' So I'd stop thinking about it and go back to work. You understand?
RATH: Yeah.
