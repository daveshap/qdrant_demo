If I died I feel like no one would notice (14m)
Idk where to start, I've always been quiet, that's just the way I am, but around the age of 11 my parents fought for custody, it didnt feel like they were fighting for me, they were fighting for my brothers, my parents never show they care for me, they're always focused on my brothers, and no one appreciates me, no matter what I do, no matter how hard I try, no one notices me

I've always had a hard time making friends, but I moved right as quarantine started, I didnt know anyone, I was alone, I lost connection with my friends, except my for my long distance girlfriend, I gave her everything I ever had, all my money, my time, my energy, there wasnt a time where I wasn't there for her, I suppose I got too attached, but, I still made sure she was happy, I helped her with her anxiety/depression, I spent months convincing her parents to get her a therapist, helped her with every problem she had, big and small, got her presents, gave her confidence, and then with the long distance our relationship got rocky, with the isolation with only her to talk to, I got depressed, I talked to her, but she never cared, she never tried to make me fell better, she only cared how she felt, so I was confused how I felt, we went on and off from texting, and then one day her bff texted me how I was toxic, I probably was but didnt see it, but, it still hurt to hear that it was my fault, i only wanted her to be happy and all I got in return was a punch in the face, me and her dated for half a year and I knew her for 3, she was my everything, I didn't have a lot of friends so I gave her all my time, she put herself in front of me, and that what everyone else does, expects me to give them attention, all my life it has been like that, all I am to people is a outlet, if I killed myself no one would care. They would forget in a month, I just wish someone cared for me for onc

I need my confidence back, I need my happiness back, I dont even know who I am, I want help


Edit: Thank you all for the reassurance, this is a lot of support and I honestly cant thank all of you enough, I've taken some advice and I'll try to better myself with it, I will try to talk to my parents about it, again, thank you all for endless kindness, it means more than you would think üëç
