DOROTHEA: How did it go today?
HARRY: I went up to the Magic Castle. You were right. He didn't have a lot of fans up there.
DOROTHEA: They were jealous of him.
HARRY: Why? Because he had you?
DOROTHEA: He... didn't have me.. I told you-
HARRY: You didn't marry him for love.
HARRY: So why did you marry him?
DOROTHEA: That's my business. Harry.
HARRY: Just curious. Back to business. Ever heard of a man called Nix? Dorothea?
DOROTHEA: Yes... I'm here. And no. I don't know the name.
HARRY: What about Jennifer Desiderio?
DOROTHEA: It doesn't ring a bell. I have to go.
HARRY: Okay. I'll keep digging.
DOROTHEA: Yes. You do that.
