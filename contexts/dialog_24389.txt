BANDIT: Well, at least it hasn't been boring.
KATE: Well, thanks for the lift.
BANDIT: Hey...
BANDIT: What can I say?
KATE: Promise me you won't fall in love with an inmate.
CLAYTON: Get your hands off my daughter!
BANDIT: Your what?
KATE: He's just exhausted.
BANDIT: That man is your father?!?
KATE: I should've told you, but you would've thrown me out, right?
BANDIT: Absolutely.
KATE: Listen, he's nuts. I mean certifiable. But believe it or not, he once looked great in Levis. That's why my mother married him. But like all good things... I know what you're thinking.
KATE: What are you thinking?
BANDIT: You gotta admire the man's determination.
