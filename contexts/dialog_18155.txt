MARANZANO: The Internal Revenue came to my offices. I turned over all my ledgers. They found nothing. Charlie, I am a businessman.
LUCIANO: Sittin' around gives me the piles. You got a proposition?
MARANZANO: We combine everything. You are my second in command.
LUCIANO: What about the share.
MARANZANO: You get fifteen percent.
LUCIANO: I got partners.
MARANZANO: Your Calabrian friend, I will accept. At least Costello eats pasta like us.
LUCIANO: And the Jews?
MARANZANO: Share with them as you wish. Do business with them on your own. But no filthy Jew will ever be a brother to me.
LUCIANO: Those fucks can't leave each other alone. Maranzano and Masseria ain't gonna be satisfied until one of 'em starts a war.
SIEGEL: Let 'em kill each other off! Why should we care?
LUCIANO: There won't be any way to stay out of it.
FRANK: I think Maranzano's talkin' a hell of a deal.
SIEGEL: Sure, Frankie. Fuck me. Fuck Meyer. Fuck Arnold Rothstein who's made us all rich. All so you can be an fuckin' honorary Sicilian!
FRANK: Does Maranzano have to kiss you on the lips before you'll take his goddamn money?
SIEGEL: If he's gonna fuck me up the ass!
