Apple TV Remote option in iPhone Control Center doesn't work I have an Apple TV which works perfectly. On my iPhone 6s I've been using the Apple TV Remote app for quite some time and that too works perfectly. A week ago I activated the Apple TV Remote option for the Control Center (in Settings > Control Centre > Customise Controls) and for the past week I've been trying to get it to work, but for some unknown reason it never ever finds my Apple TV. It just keeps searching and searching!How do I get this to work? It would be fantastic to use this from the Control Center!
