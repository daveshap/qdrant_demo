WIFE: What?
ERNIE: They fired me.
WIFE: How horrible. We'll be fine. You'll be fine. Stay here with me -- we'll go for a drive, have some drinks, make happy plans.
ERNIE: No. They're firing even more people than they said. Some will want to talk. It could help.
WIFE: I could use somebody to talk to on a day like this. Sorry. Go ahead.
ERNIE: Bye, sweetie.
WIFE: Okay, sweetie.
