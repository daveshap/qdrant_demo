I check to make sure my alarm is set at least 10 times before I go to bed. Anyone else do this?
I have 2 alarms set for work. One is my phone and the other is an actual alarm clock. Anyway, the night before I’m afraid the alarm is set wrong or it won’t go off so I constantly check it before I go to bed. Anyone else do this?
