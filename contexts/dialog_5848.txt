GITTES: No, really?
MRS. MULWRAY: I'm afraid so.
GITTES: I am sorry.
MRS. MULWRAY: Can't we talk about this alone, Mr. Gittes?
GITTES: I'm afraid not, Mrs. Mulwray. These men are my operatives and at some point they're going to assist me. I can't do everything myself.
MRS. MULWRAY: Of course not.
GITTES: Now, what makes you certain he is involved with someone?
