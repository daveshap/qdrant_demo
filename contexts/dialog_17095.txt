DOLLARHYDE: Are you cold? Would you like a blanket?
LOUNDS: Was I in an accident?
DOLLARHYDE: No, Mr. Lounds. You'll be just fine.
LOUNDS: My back hurts, my skin. Did I get burned? I hope to God I'm not burned.
DOLLARHYDE: Burned? Burned. No. You just rest there. I'll be right back.
LOUNDS: Let me lie down. Listen, I want to call my office. My God, I'm in a Stryker frame. My back's broken. Tell me the truth.
LOUNDS: What am I doing here?
DOLLARHYDE: Atoning, Mr. Lounds.
DOLLARHYDE: Do you know who I am, Mr. Lounds?
LOUNDS: I don't want to know.
DOLLARHYDE: According to you I'm a sexual failure. An animal, you said. You know now, don't you?
LOUNDS: Yes.
DOLLARHYDE: Do you feel privileged?
LOUNDS: I'm very scared.
DOLLARHYDE: Do you pray to God, Mr. Lounds?
LOUNDS: Yes.
DOLLARHYDE: Do you believe God is in attendance here, Mr. Lounds?
LOUNDS: I don't know...
DOLLARHYDE: In a little while I'll help you understand.
