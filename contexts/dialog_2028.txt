BEVERLY: You're not still writing that thank-you note?
CAROL: I'm on the last page. How do you spell conscience?
BEVERLY: C-o-n-s-c-i-e-n-c-e. I got Sean from the bakery to baby-sit so let's go out.
CAROL: I still don't feel safe leaving Spencer with someone. How do you spell it again?
BEVERLY: Spencer is okay. You'd better start finding something else to do with your free time. If you can't feel good about this break and step out a little... You ought to get Mr. Udall to send you over a psychiatrist.
CAROL: I don't need one 'cause I know what's really going on here. I have to finish this letter or I'll go nuts. This can't be right -- con- science.
