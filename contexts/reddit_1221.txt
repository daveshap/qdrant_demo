Does anyone else lose their appetite when anxious?
I’ve been anxious since I was a kid. It’s been pretty consistent my whole life but in times of stress it gets considerably worse. 
I 
just graduated college, which was a massive accomplishment for me, but I have been very high stress the last couple of months due to the anxiety of starting my “adult life”. Something that correlates with that is my loss of appetite to the point where all I can eat all day is one bagel, sometimes even less. Anything more and I either feel extremely nauseous or I start gagging when trying to eat. 

These last few months I have dropped quite a bit of weight and people keep commenting on it, telling me I look good. Which only makes me feel more anxious, mostly due to the fact that I know it’s an unhealthy consequence of my anxiety that I have no idea how to deal with. 

My question is, does anyone else ever feel this way? And if so what do you do about it?
