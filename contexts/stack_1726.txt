PCB design for outdoor use without coating I am making a PCB for a home project: a small weather station that I will place outdoors to collect data. There is now a question of environmental resistance.I can mill out the PCB for free on a relatively old machine. This means that I will not get any protection against the elements out of the box. My question then is: how quickly will the PCB degrade when left outdoors (in a housing) with only tin covering the copper and are there any relatively cheap methods of protecting the PCB against the elements?
