TRUMAN: ...personally I think the unconquered south face is the only one worth scaling...of course it's a 20,000 foot sheer wall of ice but then when did that ever stop me before?...Naturally, I intend to make the ascent without the benefit of oxygen but also without crampons or even an ice pick...<i>risks?</i>... ...sure I'm aware of the risks--why else do you think I would spend seven years as an adjuster in a life insurance company...?

MERYL: It's a surprise.
MERYL: Well, what do you think?
TRUMAN: They're... perfect. Thank you.
