What Would Need to Happen For the US to Become a Multi-Party State?
I was wondering if America could ever adopt a multi-party system like the rest of the modern democracies in the world. It seems with the rise of three third party candidates this election and the most disliked candidates in American History, there should be change to the US political system. Such examples of Germany, Australia, and Canada have four, six, or even eight major parties and what would it take to change the US to adopt a system like that. I think we would have to reform the electoral college and get rid of the winner take all system of representation.
