RIZZO: He's dead. They're both dead. You don't understand what is on this ship. This is a being that kills. That's what he does. That's all he does. And he is very good at it.
BRODSKI: Kicker, Sven. Get into the grid and tell me what the hell is going on!
DELONGPRE: Where are you going?
RIZZO: We have to get off this ship.
YLLO: That's ridiculous. You're overreacting.
RIZZO: Why don't you get it? He's going to kill us all!
BRODSKI: I doubt that. I think we can handle whatever your ancient hockey player can throw at us.
RIZZO: Look! Just get everyone together, get off the ship... and then blow it to kingdom fucking come! That's the only way you're going to live.
DELONGPRE: You just need to relax. Rizzo ti's the future. We have soldiers on board, E-X Grunts, the baddest of the bad...and their weapons? I'm sure are slightly more advanced than what you're used to.
RIZZO: I hope so.
