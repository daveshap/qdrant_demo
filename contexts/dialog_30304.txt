SCOTTIE: Ow!!
MIDGE: I thought you said no more aches and pains?
SCOTTIE: It's this darned corset. It binds. He retrieves the stick.
MIDGE: No three-way stretch? How very un- chic.
SCOTTIE: Well, you know those police department doctors: no sense of style. Ah, tomorrow!
MIDGE: What's tomorrow?
SCOTTIE: Tomorrow... the corset comes off. And this thing goes out the window. I shall be a free man. I shall wiggle my behind... free and unconfined.
SCOTTIE: Midge, do you suppose many men wear corsets?
MIDGE: More than you think.
SCOTTIE: How do you know? Personal experience?
MIDGE: Please! And what happens after tomorrow?
SCOTTIE: What do you mean?
MIDGE: What are you going to do? Now that you've quit the police force?
SCOTTIE: You sound so disapproving, Midge.
MIDGE: No, it's your life. But you were the bright young lawyer who decided he was going to be chief of police some day.
SCOTTIE: I had to quit, Midge.
MIDGE: Why?
SCOTTIE: I wake up at night seeing him fall from the roof... and try to reach out for him.
MIDGE: It wasn't your fault.
SCOTTIE: I know. Everybody tells me.
MIDGE: Johnny, the doctors explained --
SCOTTIE: I know. I have Acrophobia. What a disease. A fear of heights. And what a moment to find out I had it.
MIDGE: Well, you've got it. And there's no losing it. And there's no one to blame. So why quit?
SCOTTIE: And sit behind a desk? Chairborne?
MIDGE: It's where you belong.
SCOTTIE: Not with my Acrophobia, Midge. If I dropped a pencil on the floor and bent down to pick it up, it could be disastrous!
MIDGE: Ah, Johnny-O...
MIDGE: Well?... what'll you do?
SCOTTIE: Nothing for a while. You forget, I'm a man of independent means. Or fairly independent.
MIDGE: Mmm. Why don't you go away for a while?
SCOTTIE: To forget? Don't be so motherly, Midge. I'm not going to crack up.
MIDGE: Have you had any dizzy spells this week?
SCOTTIE: I'm having one now.
SCOTTIE: From that music.
MIDGE: Oh!
