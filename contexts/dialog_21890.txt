MRS. DOYLE: Hello.
JEFF: Mrs. Doyle?
MRS. DOYLE: Yes.
JEFF: Jeff again. Has Tom come in yet?
MRS. DOYLE: Not yet, Jeff.
JEFF: You haven't even heard from him?
MRS. DOYLE: Not a word.
MRS. DOYLE: It is something really important, Jeff?
JEFF: I'm afraid it is, Tess.
MRS. DOYLE: I'll have him call the moment I hear from him.
JEFF: Tell him not to waste time calling. To get over here soon as he can. I think Thorwald's pulling out tonight.
MRS. DOYLE: Who's Thorwald?
JEFF: He knows. Don't worry, Tess. It's a man.
MRS. DOYLE: Goodnight, you idiot.
JEFF: Goodnight, Mrs Doyle.
