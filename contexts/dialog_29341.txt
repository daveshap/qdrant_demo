REX: Woody? Who's up there with you?
SLINKY: Woody, what are you doing under the bed?
WOODY: Uh-h-h-h...nothing! Uh, nothing. I'm sure Andy was just a little excited, that's all. Too much cake and ice cream, I suppose. It's just a mistake.
MR. POTATO HEAD: Well, that MISTAKE is sitting in your spot, Woody.
REX: Have you been replaced?
