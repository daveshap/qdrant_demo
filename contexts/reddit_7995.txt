What's the difference between a fellowship and an RA/TA position?
I was recommended to apply for a fellowship by a potential grad program I'm applying to even though there should be funding for an assistantship. What's the difference between an assistantship position and a fellowship? Is there a potential reason I was told to apply to the fellowship even though there should be funding?
