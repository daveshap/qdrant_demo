How can I supplement my skills to become a data analyst?
So I worked as a “data analyst” for 2 years in IT Security but all I did was track metrics and pull data when other people couldn’t figure out how. I wouldn’t consider it actual analysis. I then got a job in retail analytics which had been my goal but it was at a startup and they had financial trouble so I was let go after only 3 months.

I want to continue doing retail analytics or customer analytics or product analytics, but I have 0 domain knowledge. I have some of the technical skills required (python, sql, excel, statistics) but no experience in the industry.

I noticed lots of postings ask for Business Analyst experience. Would it be worthwhile to get a certificate in Business Analysis? This would not be a degree or anything, it’s a continuing education certificate offered by my school. Would employers think a certificate is useful or would it be a waste of money?

I haven’t seen any courses that focus on retail analysis so I don’t know how to get experience in it since no one will hire me without experience. What kind of courses should I look for? Would they be under marketing or sociology or something? Are their courses that would teach me about Product analysis?

Any advice is appreciated.
