I'm getting confused by this girl.
I don't know what she wants. Sometimes she likes me. Sometimes she doesn't. I know she's not just playing me or using me. The feelings are real, when they're there. Sometimes, she talks to everyone BUT me. Others, she won't talk to ANYONE but me. Should I just get over her and move on? Is there something I could say or do to figure this out? I love her. And I want her happy. And if that means I have to leave to get her out if this back and forth business, so be it.

EDIT: I asked her out on a date. She said yes! Thanks for the support, guys. Without you, I might have let the opportunity slip.
