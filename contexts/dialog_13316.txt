NATHAN: You'll catch cold. It's cold. What do you suppose he is, a survivalist?
LILA: I think he's feral.
NATHAN: Feral? Don't touch him! He might be diseased! He might... My God, rabies!
LILA: He looks perfectly fine.
NATHAN: I think we should go. Please. Before he wakes up and, I don't know, eats us, or whatever feral things do.
LILA: I don't understand you. This is fascinating and you just want to run away. I mean, here we have a human being totally uncontaminated by civilization, totally free, and all you want to do is run back to your...
NATHAN: Actually, I just had an amusing thought.
LILA: What?
NATHAN: Feral, huh? Totally uncontaminated?
LILA: Look at him. He doesn't understand English. He moves like an animal.
NATHAN: It's perfect!
LILA: Nathan, what the hell are you talking about?
NATHAN: Forget mice! Actually forget guinea pigs, cats, monkeys, and chimps also. I'm on to stage five: The human subject.
LILA: Oh no. You can't take him from his home, Nathan.
NATHAN: Don't you see? He's my Tabula Rasa, my Eliza Dolittle. He's my ticket to the top of the Behaviorist food chain. He's going to make me famous.
LILA: I won't allow you. It's wrong. He's happy here.
NATHAN: Is he, Lila? Is he happy living filthy and naked alone in this tick infested wilderness? Never to know the love of a good woman, never to revel in the pitter-patter of little feet, never to read Moby Dick, or marvel at a Monet, or just sit back after a day of hard but rewarding work, smoke a pipe, and wonder about the nature of reality.
LILA: You'd be taking away his freedom, Nathan.
NATHAN: Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose, Lila, to quote Janet Jackson.
