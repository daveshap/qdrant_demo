What has the Trump administration done to combat the opioid crisis? What concrete plans do they have for the near future?
I'm specifically looking for anything we can find regarding laws, policies in the DoJ, funding and so on. I have seen the issue brought up several times by the President and AG (1,2), but I'm having trouble finding specifics. 


The national institute on drug abuse has a good overview of the origin of the crisis and it's breadth, but again seems to lack specific policy initiatives and who started them.
