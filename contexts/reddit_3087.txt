Is Computer Science or Engineering worth getting into at 28?
I never went to college and I just got my high school equivalency. I'm not stupid, just made childish, fear based decisions in my early 20s and have been fighting hard against them ever since. I went from making minimum wage to 35k a year in less than a year, so I'm proud of how far I've come. People are starting to recognize my ability to learn and that feels good.

That being said, the job I'm at now cannot be forever. It's within the tourism industry which is not a stable or recession resistant industry. I also know (and this has taken a lot of work to come to this conclusion) I am able of mind for much more difficult and high paying work in speciality fields.

However, by the time I finish a degree I would be at least 32. That's optimistic. I would be in debt and be 10 years behind my cohorts. I know I'll never have as successful a life as others, but what can I do to use what gifts I do have to capitalize on the time I do have? Are computer science/engineering degrees worth it later in life? Are there similar career paths that require less education? Right now, I plan to start classes in the fall at a community college working on required classes and mathematics. Beyond that, I don't know.
