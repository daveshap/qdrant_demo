MR. HAND: I think I've made my point with you tonight.
SPICOLI: Hey, Mr. Hand, can I ask you a question?
MR. HAND: What's that?
SPICOLI: Do you have a guy like me every year? A guy to... I don't know, make a show of. Teach other kids lessons and stuff?
MR. HAND: Well, you'll find out next year.
SPICOLI: No way, mon. When I graduate U.S. history I ain't even coming over to your side of the building.
MR. HAND: If you graduate.
SPICOLI: You're gonna flunk me?!
MR. HAND: Don't worry, Spicoli. You'll probably squeak by.
SPICOLI: All right! Oh, yeah!
SPICOLI: Aloha, Mr. Hand!
MR. HAND: Aloha, Spicoli.
STACY: Where's Doug?
LINDA: He's not coming.
STACY: Not coming? What happened?
LINDA: He says he's got to stay in Chicago. He says I should visit him sometimes.
STACY: Sometime?
LINDA: Yeah, like maybe never.
STACY: But what are you going to do?
LINDA: Well I might go to Dartmouth.
STACY: Dartmouth?!
LINDA: I didn't tell anyone I applied cause I never thought I'd make it.
STACY: I can't believe it! But what about Doug?
LINDA: There's a world of guys out there. I just wish I didn't have to date any of them.
STACY: Hey -- Doug Stallworth? It's his loss.
