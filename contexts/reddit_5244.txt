Can my boss leave me off the schedule?(california)
I dont know if this is the right place for this question but I'm having a little bit of an issue with my manager. I wont go into it because it's a lot but this is the latest thing.

I work in California at a Domino's. We get week by week Monday-Sunday schedules. There was no discipline or reason to be left off of the schedule, she just didnt schedule me. Isnt the law in California that if you are available you have to recieve at least 2 hours?

Thank you for the help!
