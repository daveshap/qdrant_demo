Co-worker I'm interested in has a girlfriend
Just got a new co-worker at my office about a week ago. Super attractive, great personality. We immediately hit it off, have tons in common and IM each other throughout the day to discuss things we enjoy. Today I overheard him mentioning his girlfriend in conversation with another co-worker. Boo. Oh well, hopefully we'll still develop a good friendship.
