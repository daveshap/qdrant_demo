The worst essays you can write
**The "metaphor" essay**

If you really think about it, life is exactly like a burrito. We all hide our true selves from the world with a wrapped-up covering. But inside, we host a plethora of fascinating offerings: cheese, rice, beans, chicken, and so much more. Inside my own burrito, I have my artistic eye and my caring heart. Those might constitute my beans and cheese. But someone else's cheese might be their love of surfing or their ability to speak ten languages. In conclusion, we should all unwrap our burritos and let the rice and beans spill out into a messy pile.

**The sports injury essay**

It was the day of the big game. I had been preparing my whole life to play on that field that day. Sweat dripped down my face as I ran the warmup laps with my team. Suddenly I felt a horrible pain in my leg and I realized that I had stubbed my toe. "NO!" I gasped. "Not on the day of the big game!"

Coach looked solemnly at me. "Your career is over," he said. "You can't play in the big game now."

Suddenly his phone rang. He picked it up and frowned with concern. "Oh no! Our star player has just come down with the flu and won't be able to play. Now we don't have enough players for the big game. We're going to have to forfeit."

A burst of adrenaline coursed through my veins. "No, we won't," I said, standing up resolutely. "I'm going to play."

Coach looked at me in awe.

That game I played like I had never played before, fighting through my agony for the team. Despite the unimaginable pain of my toe, I found it in me to score the winning goal. As I held the golden trophy above my head, I proudly realized that my hard work had gotten me here. Because, as Abraham Lincoln always said, winners never quit.

**The "thesaurus" essay**

I cherish to acquire comprehension in school, thus perusing volumes is my preoccupation. My incarnation is blithesome because I am disclosing new atmospheres and modes of quintessence. This scintillating diversion alleviates all malaises and obfuscations through elucidation. Whereas herein lies my denouement: construing utilization is my zeal.

**The sob story essay**

My life was never easy. I was born at a very young age, and was immediately plunged into hardship. I should have had a 4.9 GPA, however my numerous struggles have understandably resulted in my 1.7 GPA.

It all started with a birthday gift of AirPods. Unfortunately I received them just a week before the new AirPods 3 came out and everyone noticed my old-model AirPods and called me broke. Dear reader, the only thing broke was my heart. I couldn't even activate Siri with my model. However, I dusted myself off and trudged onwards. The next obstacle would be the one to shoot down my dreams. I had long hoped to launch a successful career as an Instagram influencer. With high hopes and my heart in my throat, I posted a selfie. To my horror, it received a measly 3 likes. This has wounded my spirit irreparably and I have since been struggling to cope. Obviously schoolwork has had to wait while I turn my attention to dealing with my greater problems.

**The overly descriptive essay**

At 6:35 am, I wake up and look at the lavender shade of my walls - not quite blue, not quite pink - and breathe in deeply. If my room were a clock, I have a periodic table poster above my closet at 3 o'clock, a world map slightly to the right of my desk at 9 o'clock, and a certificate for my work in cancer research at 11 o'clock. As I get up, I am aware of the white paint on my door and the soft fluff of my beige rug. Today is a cold day, about 65 degrees Fahrenheit or 18.3333 degrees Celsius. I slip on my puffy green winter jacket and my bright red Nikes and step outside onto the cracked gray sidewalk. As I walk, I glance at a small brown squirrel darting across the long black power line. Soon it is time for school, where I will fill my inquisitive mind with knowledge and apply my bountiful observational skills.

**The inspirational service trip essay**

Through my service trip to \[INSERT COUNTRY HERE\], I learned that helping others is good. This led to the realization that service is my passion. That is why I will be perfect for helping others by being a doctor/lawyer/CS programmer. As soon as I arrived in a poorer country with my $2,500 summer program, I started to miss the clean streets of my Silicon Valley neighborhood. But I took pictures with local children and followed my tour group around, so now I know just what it means to dedicate oneself to service. Here's the funny thing: I went to \[INSERT COUNTRY HERE\] to help others, but what I didn't know is that they had helped me. Due to the five days that I spent in \[INSERT COUNTRY HERE\] I have become more caring and aware and humble. These are all qualities that I will bring to the UC Hicago/St. Anford campus.

**The "intellectual curiosity" essay**

For as long as I can remember, I have always asked "why?" to everyone around me. As a child, I practically lived in libraries, carrying wagons of encyclopedias home every night. I blew through sixty books a day, and even that wasn't enough for my thicc brain. I had an unquenchable thirst for knowledge that could never be satisfied, not by Einstein's treatises on relativity, not by the Feynman physics lectures. By the age of three, I was writing academic papers with my crayons. In conclusion, I have am quite a curious intellectual. Harvard, please let me in.
