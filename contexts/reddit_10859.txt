I feel like the struggles of young adults and teens on this sub aren't treated as seriously because they are young.
I've seen many people here see someones age being under 25 or so and just downplay their feelings because "they have a lot of time to fix it." I see it especially with teens. Many people simply say to "give it time, your angsty, your horomones are raging, etc..." and I wont deny that certainly plays a part in it. However, I think it's dangerous to put all teens under this blanket, as many are truly suffering from issues that cant be fixed by simply becoming an adult. Someone looking for support here doesnt want to have their feelings downplayed and ignored, regardless of the cause of them.
