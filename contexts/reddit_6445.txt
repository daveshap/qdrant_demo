Am i making a rash decision in going to grad school after i got a rescind letter from my first job as a recent college graduate ?
Hello !

yesterday, i unforunately received a rescinded letter from a company as a recent college graduate. However, considering with all the crap that is going on right now, should i try to ride it out with a masters ?

&#x200B;

the reason that im asking if this is a rash decision is because grad school was literally not on my radar and getting a rescinded letter was not something that i was expecting especially after graduating 3 days ago.

&#x200B;

what should i do ? i know there are going to be many angles of approach in terms of "what i should do" but im open to hearing what your guys' input might be.

&#x200B;

Thanks !

edit: initially, i had plans of pursuing a masters while i was working... and i cant pursue a masters without pulling out loans.
