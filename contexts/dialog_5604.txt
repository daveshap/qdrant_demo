PETER: En garde.
REGGIE: Lay on, MacDuff.
GIDEON: Mrs. Lampert --
REGGIE: What do you want?
GIDEON: Didn't Charles tell you, Mrs. Lampert?
REGGIE: Tell me what?
GIDEON: It doesn't belong to you, Mrs. Lampert -- you do know that, don't you?
REGGIE: I don't know anything.
GIDEON: Mrs. Lampert, any morning now you could wake up dead.
REGGIE: Leave me alone -- !
GIDEON: Dead, Mrs. Lampert -- like last week's news -- like Charles, Mrs. Lampert --
REGGIE: Stop it!
