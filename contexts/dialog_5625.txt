DYLE: Listen -- all I really want is an estimate.
REGGIE: It's not so bad. You may not be able to lie on your back for a few days -- but, then, you can lie from any position, can't you?
REGGIE: Does it hurt?
DYLE: Haven't you got a bullet I can bite?
REGGIE: Are you really Carson Dyle's brother?
DYLE: Would you like to see my passport?
REGGIE: Your passport! What kind of a proof is that?
DYLE: Would you like to see where I was tattooed?
REGGIE: Sure.
DYLE: Okay, I'll drive you around there some day. Ouch!
REGGIE: Ha ha. You could at least tell me what your first name is these days.
DYLE: Alexander.
REGGIE: Is there a Mrs. Dyle?
DYLE: Yes, but we're divorced.
REGGIE: I thought that was Peter Joshua.
DYLE: I'm no easier to live with than he was.
REGGIE: There -- you're a new man.
DYLE: I'm sorry I couldn't tell you the truth, but I had to find out your part in all this.
REGGIE: Alex -- how can you tell if someone is lying or not?
DYLE: You can't.
REGGIE: There must be some way.
DYLE: There's an old riddle about two tribes of Indians -- the Whitefeet always tell the truth and the Blackfeet always lie. So one day you meet an Indian, you ask him if he's a truthful Whitefoot or a lying Blackfoot? He tells you he's a truthful Whitefoot, but which one is he?
REGGIE: Why couldn't you just look at his feet?
DYLE: Because he's wearing moccasins.
REGGIE: Oh. Well, then he's a truthful Whitefoot, of course.
DYLE: Why not a lying Blackfoot?
REGGIE: Which one are you?
DYLE: Whitefoot, of course.
REGGIE: Come here.
