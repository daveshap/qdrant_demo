How many of you are in grad school for a subject you didn't study in undergrad? What was the transition like?
I'm genuinely curious about what that experience was like for you.

Most of the people I know, including myself, studied undergrad subject A and went into grad school subject A, or a heavily related topic. So it was like studying economics and then going into the PhD economics track or studying math and then going into the PhD economics track. The former had a leg up on theory while the latter had a leg up on the math but both were similar enough to dive right into the PhD track.

So if you're in grad school for something not studied in ungrad, what is it like for you so far and why the change?
