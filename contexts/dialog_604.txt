MARTHA: My sister died in a convent. And it's her voice I hear. Does my smoking bother you?
MOTHER MIRIAM: No, it reminds me.
MARTHA: Would you like one? Huh?
MOTHER MIRIAM: I'd love one.
MOTHER MIRIAM: I'm out of prac... ... practice.
MARTHA: All right?
MOTHER MIRIAM: Fine thanks...
MARTHA: Do you suppose the saints would have smoked if tobacco had been popular back then?
MOTHER MIRIAM: Undoubtedly. Not the ascetics of course but, well Saint Thomas More...
MARTHA: Long, thin and filtered.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Saint Ignatius would smoke cigars and stub them out on the soles of his bare feet. And of course
MARTHA: Hand rolled.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Even Christ would partake socially.
MARTHA: Saint Peter?
MOTHER MIRIAM: Pipe!
MARTHA: Right...
MOTHER MIRIAM: Mary Magdelen?
MARTHA: Oh, you've come a long way baby.
MOTHER MIRIAM: And Saint John would chew tobacco.
MARTHA: Right. What do you suppose today's saints are smoking?
MOTHER MIRIAM: There are no saints today. Good people yes, but extraordinarily good people... those I'm afraid we are sorely lacking.
MARTHA: Do you think they ever existed?
MOTHER MIRIAM: Yes I do.
MARTHA: Do you want to become one?
MOTHER MIRIAM: Become? One is born a saint.
MARTHA: Well you can try, can't you, to be good?
MOTHER MIRIAM: Yes, but goodness has very little to do with it. Not all the saints were good, in fact some of them were a little crazy. But... they were still attached to God. Agnes has that birth. No more... we're born, we live, we die. No room for miracles. Oh my dear, how I miss the miracles.
MARTHA: Do you think Agnes is still attached to God?
MOTHER MIRIAM: Listen to her singing.
MARTHA: I'd like to begin.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Begin what?
MARTHA: The hypnotism. Do you still disapprove?
MOTHER MIRIAM: Would it stop you if I did?
MARTHA: No.
MOTHER MIRIAM: May I be present?
MARTHA: Of course.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Then let's begin.
MARTHA: You're listening to a chorus of angels. The music surrounds you like a... warm and, comfortable pool of water. And while you're sleeping, you're going to be able to recall, all the things that we want you to remember. And when I count to three and clap my hands, you'll no longer be hypnotised. Can you hear me.
AGNES: Yes.
MARTHA: Who am I?
AGNES: Doctor Livingston.
MARTHA: And why am I here?
AGNES: To help me.
MARTHA: Good. Would you like to tell me why you're here?
AGNES: Because I'm in trouble.
MARTHA: What kind of trouble? What kind of trouble Agnes?
AGNES: I'm frightened.
MARTHA: Of what?
AGNES: Of telling you.
MARTHA: But it's easy. It's just a breath with sound. Say it. What kind of trouble?
AGNES: I had a baby.
MARTHA: How did you have a baby?
AGNES: It came out of me.
MARTHA: Did you know what was going to come out?
AGNES: Yes.
MARTHA: Did you want it to come out?
AGNES: No.
MARTHA: Why?
AGNES: Because I was afraid.
MARTHA: Why were you afraid?
AGNES: Because I wasn't worthy.
MARTHA: To be a mother?
AGNES: Yes.
MARTHA: Why?
AGNES: May I open my eyes now?
MARTHA: No not yet Agnes, very soon but not yet. How did the baby get into you?
AGNES: It grew.
MARTHA: What made it grow? Do you know?
AGNES: Yes.
MARTHA: Would you like to tell me?
AGNES: No.
MARTHA: Did anyone else know about the baby?
AGNES: I can't tell you that.
MARTHA: Will she be angry?
AGNES: She made me promise not to.
MARTHA: Who? Who made you promise? It's alright Agnes. It's alright. Let's go to your room. It's the night about six weeks ago when you were very sick.
AGNES: I'm afraid.
MARTHA: Oh don't be, I'm here. It's alright. I want you to tell me what you did before you went to bed.
AGNES: I ate.
MARTHA: Hm hmm. What did you have for dinner?
AGNES: Fish... ... brussel sprouts.
MARTHA: You don't like brussel sprouts?
AGNES: I hate them.
MARTHA: And then what happened?
AGNES: We went to chapel for vespers.
MARTHA: Hm hmm.
AGNES: I left early because I wasn't feeling very well.
MARTHA: What is it?
AGNES: Someone's following me.
MARTHA: Who?
AGNES: Sister Marguerite I think.
MARTHA: Was it Sister Marguerite who knew about the baby? Alright Agnes, I want you to see your room as you saw it on that night.
AGNES: My bed.
MARTHA: What else?
AGNES: A crucifix.
MARTHA: Above the bed? Any... anything else? What do you you see, something different? What is it?
AGNES: A wastepaper basket.
MARTHA: Do you know who put it there?
AGNES: No.
MARTHA: What do you think it's there for?
AGNES: For me to get sick in.
MARTHA: Are you ill?
AGNES: Yes.
MARTHA: What do you feel?
AGNES: I feel as if I've eaten glass.
MARTHA: What do you do?
AGNES: I have to throw up...
MARTHA: Which one?
AGNES: I don't know which one
MARTHA: Of what?
AGNES: Of me. Oh... God! My God... Water... it's all water...
MARTHA: Why isn't anyone coming?
AGNES: They can't hear me that's why. Oh God... I don't wanna...
