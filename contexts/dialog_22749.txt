JONAH: Sure. I'd really like that. Thank you so much.
VICTORIA: Well...
JONAH: I think they're announcing your flight.
SAM: He's ten.
VICTORIA: He's good at it.
SAM: I read an article about this ...
VICTORIA: I read the same article...
SAM: It takes time --
VICTORIA: Absolutely. When I come back, maybe the two of us should spend some time together, on our own. What do you think?
SAM: Sure. Sure.
SAM: Jonah, this isn't fair. You don't know Victoria. I hardly know her myself. She is, in fact, a mystery to me. She tosses her hair a lot. Why does she do this? I have no idea. Is it a twitch? Does she need a haircut? Should she use barrette so it doesn't keep falling in her face? These are things that I'm willing to get to the bottom of, and that is why I am dating her. That is all I am doing. I am not marrying her. Can you appreciate the difference? That's what single people do, they try people on and they see if they fit. But nobody fits perfectly, everyone is an adjustment.
JONAH: Was Mom an adjustment?
SAM: I'm never going to meet anyone who's going to measure up to your mom in your eyes? What do you think? There's a perfect woman walking around out there?
