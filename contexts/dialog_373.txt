WELLES: Okay...
MRS CHRISTIAN: My husband never dealt with money personally, certainly not cash.
WELLES: I'm not positive this means anything.
MRS CHRISTIAN: The checks were for odd amounts...
MRS CHRISTIAN: One was for two hundred thousand, one dollar and thirteen cents. Another was for three hundred thousand, six hundred fifty four dollars and seventy six cents...
WELLES: Okay, I follow you so far...
MRS CHRISTIAN: Totalled together, these five checks from five different accounts, they equal one million dollars.
WELLES: You're joking.
MRS CHRISTIAN: To the penny. Exactly one million dollars in cash.
MRS CHRISTIAN: Hello... ?
WELLES: I'm here.
MRS CHRISTIAN: Do you think the film could have cost that much?
WELLES: For a human life... murder on film, no statute of limitations. Who knows? It sure could have. I'd like you to overnight me a copy of those checks, then put them in a safe deposit box.
MRS CHRISTIAN: Okay.
WELLES: Send it to me through the post office like we arranged. No return address. You dug this up all by yourself?
MRS CHRISTIAN: You told me to look, so I looked.
WELLES: You're one hell of a detective, Mrs. Christian.
