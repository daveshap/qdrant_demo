How to deal with not doing something your boss asked you to do?
Me and my manager were off on holiday at the same time last week. 

Before I went on holiday my manager asked me to sign something in her name and send off once she’d had a read through as she was on holiday that day. 

I waited for the go ahead, nothing so I text her as she was at the airport if she’d managed to read it so I can sign and send and I got no response. I even waited an hour after work in case she messaged then. Still nothing but I had to leave to pack and go to the airport and couldn’t wait longer. I signed the form and sent it to myself so if she messaged me in the evening I could send from my phone. Still nothing. When I was on holiday I couldn’t get my work emails due to lack of connection and I just left it as I couldn’t enjoy myself as I was worrying. 

Well I’m back to work tomorrow and now I’m so scared I’ll be in huge trouble for not sending it as she said it had to go that Friday. But she also said she would read through to check it was fine. As it was signing and agreeing to something on behalf of the company and I didn’t get her response I didn’t send it. 
Am I to blame? Should I have just done it? My heart is pounding for tomorrow. But imagine it was wrong and I signed it?
