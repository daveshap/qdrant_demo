BURNS: I know I wasn't a good husband, Hildy, but you can always count on me.
BRUCE: I don't think she'll need you very much -- I aim to do most of the protecting myself.
BURNS: Well, I'll tell you one thing, old man, she never looked at me the way she's looking at you.
HILDY: I might have, Walter, but you were never there.
BURNS: Anyway, I'm glad you two are going to be happy and have all the things I couldn't give her. You know, Hildy is about the best reporter in the country -- and that goes regardless of sex. But all she really ever wanted was a home.
BRUCE: Well, I'll try to give her one.
BURNS: I know you will, Bruce. Are you going to live with your mother?
BRUCE: Just for the first year.
BURNS: That'll be nice. A home with mother. A real honeymoon. In Albany, too. Ow!
BRUCE: Mighty nice little town, Albany. They've got the State Capitol there, you know.
BURNS: Yes, I know... Hildy, will you ever forget the night you brought the Governor back to your hotel room and found me taking a bath? She didn't even know I was in town...
