HENRY: Stop!
INDY: What?
HENRY: Stop! Stop!
HENRY: You're going the wrong Way! We have to get to Berlin!
INDY: Brody's this way.
HENRY: My Diary's in Berlin.
INDY: You don't need the Diary, Dad. Marcus has the map.
HENRY: There is more in the Diary than just the map.
INDY: All right Dad -- tell me.
HENRY: Well, he who finds the Grail must face the final challenge.
INDY: What final challenge?
HENRY: Three devices of such lethal cunning.
INDY: Booby traps?
HENRY: Oh, yes. But I found the clues that will safely take us through, in the Chronicles of St. Anselm.
INDY: But what are they? Can't you remember?
HENRY: I wrote them down in my Diary so that I wouldn't have to remember.
INDY: Half the German Army's on our tail and you want me to go to Berlin? Into the lion's den?
HENRY: Yes! The only thing that matters is the Grail.
INDY: What about Marcus?
HENRY: Marcus would agree with me.
INDY: Two selfless martyrs. Jesus Christ!
HENRY: That's for blasphemy. The quest for the Grail is not archaeology. It's a race against evil. If it is captured by the Nazis, the armies of darkness will march all over the face of the earth. Do you understand me?
INDY: This is an obsession Dad. I never understood it. Never. Neither did Mom.
HENRY: Oh yes, she did. Only too well. Unfortunately she kept her illness from me until all I could do was mourn her.
