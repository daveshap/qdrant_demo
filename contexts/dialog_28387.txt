GARFIELD: We bought ya a tap into Moe Anenberg's wire. He's got eyes at every track in the country. You'll get race results, odds, scratches, pole positions, everything; and just as fast as Western Union gets 'em.
NILES: Does J.J. know how to use this thing?
GARFIELD: All he's gotta do is read.
DUFF: Buck Duff. I was in Maxwell's boost in Troy.
TWIST: You the Duff that didn't come up with his end when Little Jeff was sent up?
DUFF: Wasn't no problem a mine.
TWIST: He was a con man, wasn't he?
DUFF: He was a tear-off rat. He got what he deserved. No sense helpin' pay his bills.
TWIST: Shove off, Duff.
