Hi. My name is Ariana Tobin and I'm a journalist at the nonprofit accountability outlet ProPublica ([propublica.org](https://propublica.org)).  We would love your help with a new investigation into a pattern we think is hurting lower income people.

Did you expect to receive a big tax refund, but then didn’t get it because you were audited by the IRS? [Here's what the letter might look like](https://www.propublica.org/getinvolved/irs-audit-earned-income-tax-credit-refund-help).  The biggest tax credit is called the Earned Income Tax Credit. It’s mainly for people who work and have kids to take care of. It’s aimed at people who earn under $40,000 a year.

The IRS audits a lot of people who claim this credit. When that happens, the IRS blocks the refund. Some people may actually end up owing tax instead of getting a refund. We particularly would love to hear from you – we don’t think you’re alone, and we're trying to find as many people as we can to shed some light on who gets hurt.

Happy to answer any questions about what we do and why we're looking into this. I'm [ariana.tobin@propublica.org](mailto:ariana.tobin@propublica.org) and my colleague [Paul Kiel](https://www.propublica.org/people/paul-kiel) is [paul.kiel@propublica.org](mailto:paul.kiel@propublica.org). We'd both also love any ideas on getting the word out!
