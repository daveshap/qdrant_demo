What do I do after undergrad to become an academic advisor?
I'm currently majoring in psychology and women's and gender studies (thanks to you guys :)) and I am unsure of what comes next. Do I go to grad school? If so, which programs should I look into? Ideally I'd like to work in a college, but would be fine with working in a high school.
