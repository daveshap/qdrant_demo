HOMER: Don't get too excited, Fuzzy.
FUZZY: Why can't we have pumpkins for Christmas, too? We don't get any good presents at Christmas, anyway.
HOMER: Has anyone offered you anything to eat?
WALLY: Actually, someone did. I just didn't think I could eat anything.
HOMER: I wonder if you might give me a ride.
WALLY: Sure! Be glad to! Uh... a ride where?
HOMER: Where are you going?
WALLY: We're heading back to Cape Kenneth.
