"talk to someone" yeah I did and it's pointless, rant
Talking doesn't make anything better, it just means one more person knows how fucked up and far gone I am, and they can't do anything about it. I've come to realise that there's no hope and I'm better off alone until I can go through with completion. Fuck my brain and demons, I can't wait until I delete myself from the gene pool, such a rejected waste of fucking oxygen and space
