My best friend has a crush on me.
Hi so I was wondering if anyone would help with my situation I’m honestly confused and lost on what to do. And my one fren day outside group doesn’t know how to help. 

Okay so, there’s about 7 people in our friend group. 6 girls and 1 boy. Though he doesn’t sit with us at lunch. Now I’m dating one of the girls in our group. I am also a female. Let’s name her Sarah. Me and Sarah have been dating since Saturday. I don’t really know if I like her or not I’m still figuring that out. Our relationship was a heat of the moment thing. I thought I did but I don’t know. I’m terrible I know. 

Anyways, I told the group about this on Monday. Sarah wasn’t at school. Now I had just figured out that me friend was pan (I’m bi btw..). This was a surprise for me. My impression on the group was privileged, white, straight, Christian girls. I was shocked. 

So, I started to ask her who she liked. She wouldn’t tell me at first and had me ask questions and stuff. So I did. And all of them lead to it being me. So I asked her. On paper. And turns out she does. 

Now I don’t really know what to do. I feel like it’s gonna be awkward. And I kinda like her which I told her so I feel like it’s gonna be weird. Plus me her and Sarah were planning to go to a play and the mall together on Saturday. Help.

Update: I broke up with Sarah but I still don’t know what to do about my friend.
