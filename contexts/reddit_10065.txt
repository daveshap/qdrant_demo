How long to wait to hear back from an application?
I applied for a job in early December, and haven’t heard anything. In fact, the job is still posted and accepting applications. Based on my qualifications and the job post, I feel that I should make it past the initial application review. 

Any advice? Should I just accept that I won’t get a response? Should I reach out and reiterate my interest?
