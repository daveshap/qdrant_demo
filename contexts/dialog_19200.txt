JOSIE: Not here, Duff.
DUFF: I get it. Yeah, I can see your old man with a shot-gun right now.
JOSIE: But I would like to see you again.
DUFF: You would, huh? If I was you, baby - I wouldn't go 'round stickin' out my jugular vein.
JOSIE: What d'you mean?
DUFF: You almost got into trouble back there.
JOSIE: I wouldn't have let you.
DUFF: Hell, baby, I'm not in the third grade. Well, look - what' we gonna do next time -- have a nice long chat in the parlor?
JOSIE: No, on the porch.
DUFF: Oh yeah, and then what?
JOSIE: What?
DUFF: Well, either we're gonna hit the hay or get married. Now you don't want to hit the hay, and I don' want to get married.
JOSIE: You have some very primitive ideas, don't you?
DUFF: All right, so I'm primitive. So what d'you want with me?
JOSIE: Look, Duff - most of the men I know - they're kind of sad. When I met you the other day I had a feeling that you're different. That's why I went out with you. I thought we might have something to say to each other.
DUFF: Hell, baby, I don't know what to say.
JOSIE: Good night, Duff.
