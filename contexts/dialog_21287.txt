JENNIFER: I told you. I'm like positive.
DAVID: This thing works. We could go home right now.
JENNIFER: I'm not ready yet. I gotta do this for a little while.
JENNIFER: Besides. You think there's like a chance I'm gonna get into college back there?
DAVID: Honestly ... no.
DAVID: You got the admissions letter.
JENNIFER: Right here.
DAVID: And you're sure about this?
