PAUL: Did you ever go back to see her?
AUGGIE: Once, about three or four months later. I felt so bad about stealing the camera, I hadn't even used it yet. I finally made up my mind to return it, but Granny Ethel wasn't there anymore. Someone else had moved into the apartment, and he couldn't tell me where she was.
PAUL: She probably died.
AUGGIE: Yeah, probably.
PAUL: Which means that she spent her last Christmas with you.
AUGGIE: I guess so. I never thought of it that way.
PAUL: It was a good deed, Auggie. It was a nice thing you did for her.
AUGGIE: I lied to her, and then I stole from her. I don't see how you can call that a good deed.
PAUL: You made her happy. And the camera was stolen anyway. It's not as if the person you took it from really owned it.
AUGGIE: Anything for art, eh, Paul?
PAUL: I wouldn't say that. But at least you've put the camera to good use.
AUGGIE: And now you've got your Christmas story, don't you?
PAUL: Yes, I suppose I do.
AUGGIE: What do you mean?
PAUL: I mean, it's a good story.
AUGGIE: Shit. If you can't share your secrets with your friends, what kind of friend are you?
PAUL: Exactly. Life just wouldn't be worth living, would it?
VOICE ONE: -- Breaker, this is Banana Peel...
VOICE TWO: -- Yeah, Breaker go head on.
VOICE ONE: -- Thanks much. I'd like to get me a Smokey report?
VOICE TWO: -- Road looks clean as a hound's tooth.
VOICE ONE: -- Okey, doke. Last one to the Roadeo is a homo.
DICKEY: Is that Bandit in the lead?
KYLE: If that sumbitch was in the race, he'd be in the winner's circle by now.
DICKEY: I still think this whole idea is dumb, pop.
KYLE: Then it must be a helluva idea.
DICKEY: Why don't we just rent a Lear jet and haul it back ourselves?
KYLE: Because I wanna see this hot shot Bandit do something that can't be done. Besides, there's nothing I like better than breaking legends.
DICKEY: But if it can't be done, how's he gonna do it?
KYLE: That's the point, Dickey.
DICKEY: Oh.
KYLE: Now, you just find him, son.
DICKEY: Yes, sir.
