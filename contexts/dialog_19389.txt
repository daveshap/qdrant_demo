CRAIG: I ain't trying to rob you...
PINKY: Shut up! Fo' I pump this Glock in yo' ass! What did you do wit Day-Day and Roach?
CRAIG: Man, Day-Day is my people!
PINKY: I said shut up! Now who sent you?
CRAIG: Nobody!
PINKY: If you say another word, it's over. I'm not playing!
DAY-DAY: I gotta think of a plan to get this money before tomorrow.
ROACH: You could sell your Beamer.
DAY-DAY: I don't know. I hope Craig got a good idea. We gotta ask him when he comes out. Let's go and clean up before Pinky gets here.
ROACH: Maybe you can ask him to loan you the money.
DAY-DAY: Yoooo, that's it. You ain't as dumb as I think you are, Roach.
ROACH: I know.
