this world fucking sucks.
nothing is fair. it’s all luck. there are shitty people. nothing anyone does has made my life better. i know i will kill myself eventually. why the fuck wouldn’t i. our whole species is one giant fucking machine. there is no god. there is no one who wants me. the few good things are far outweighed by the bad things. i refuse to feel like this for seventy more years
