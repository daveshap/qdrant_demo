Should I quit my Walmart job to move back in with my mom and go back to school?
I have a bachelors degree in Art History. Since I graduated five years ago my life has been very rocky and my work history is a mess, with several extended gaps. After moving to California I ended up getting a clerical job related to my degree. I worked there a year and a half but then had a mental breakdown. I moved across the country (to Texas) and spent a year unemployed. I met someone and signed a lease with them. That lease ends in three weeks and my life has fallen apart. Since leaving California I spent a year unemployed and was then forced to take a crappy job at Walmart after failing to find work in my field. I’ve been there two months, busting my ass for peanuts. 

I will no longer be living with the person who I signed the lease with and if I decide to keep the Walmart job I will have to live with a stranger on Craigslist. I feel like I have no reason to stay in Texas (no friends or family here) but if I move back home to Iowa I am worried I won’t find a job at all. I have an utterly terrible work history with tons of job hopping and one two year gap and another year long gap. I will also be leaving this Walmart job after two months, further tarnishing my work history. Walmart was my employer of last resort and now I am quitting them too.

The town I will be moving to is significantly smaller than the big city in Texas I live in now and the employment options aren’t great. But I really feel like I need to retrain and get a practical degree rather than waste my life working  in minimum wage retail hell. I won’t be able to do that if I am struggling to survive in a city where I have no contacts. I would be able to live rent free in Iowa and could focus primarily on my education though I will obviously need to work part time.

I am almost 28 and time seems to be running out. I have been agonizing over this decision for months. Please help.

Thank you
