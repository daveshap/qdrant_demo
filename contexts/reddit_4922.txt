i just got rejected
i’ve been in love with this dude for months and it finally happened. he said he didn’t have feelings for me and he never would. i feel like an idiot and fool for thinking he could love me. he was my favorite person and now i’m lost. the darkness is consuming me and i want to let it. i hate myself for not being good enough
