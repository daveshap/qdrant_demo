GENE: Yes sir I was.
GARRY: And did you witness the shoot-out?
GENE: Yes sir, I did.
GARRY: From what you saw, did Huey Newton start the shooting?
GENE: No sir he didn't.
GARRY: Huh, well then... did someone else start shooting?
GENE: I refuse to answer the question on the grounds it might incriminate me.
GARRY: Did you shoot the officers in question?
GENE: Again I'll take the fifth amendment on that question.
