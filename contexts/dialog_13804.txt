RICHARD SCRUGGS: Has he decided to go public? Because let me tell you, we've been doing this for three years now, and we've worked with a lot of corporate cases involving whistle-blowers, so we know... Big Tobacco will do everything in their power to stop him. So, is your man truly committed?
LOWELL: Well, actually, no. Well, he's on the fence. That's the point.
RICHARD SCRUGGS: Well, we'd certainly be interested in making his acquaintance, but without knowing what he's going to do...
LOWELL: Well, would you want him to call you? Or, you want to call him? How do you want to do it?
RICHARD SCRUGGS: It would be better if he called us.
LOWELL: Yeah.
RICHARD SCRUGGS: Alright?
LOWELL: Okay. Thank you.
LOWELL: Shit...
LOWELL: Oh, we need cops on the street. We don't need them on horses.
DEBBIE DELUCA: I don't know what he was thinking.
LOWELL: Oh, for God's sake, what has this guy got, a horse fetish?
DEBBIE DELUCA: Alright, alright.
LOWELL: Get me to New Orleans this afternoon. I'll shoot the fucking thing myself!
DEBORAH: What are you cooking?
LIANE: I'm cooking pasta primavera.
DEBORAH: Oh, I love that stuff.
