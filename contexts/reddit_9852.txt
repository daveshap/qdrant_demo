Can't decide on getting a Masters in Student Affairs and Higher Education, any advice?
I graduated in 2011 with a Bachelor's in Social Studies Education and cannot find a job. With the current climate in education right now, I've been worried about whether I would be happy being a public ed. teacher. I have been thinking of getting a Masters in Student Affairs and Higher Education. Any advice or thoughts about what it is like to work for a college in an administrative/student affairs type situation? For those of you who work at a college, do you like your job why/why not? Would you think this would be a wise career move for me?
