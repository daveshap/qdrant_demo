JACK: The quest's at an end and where's the good of it? A faerie festival over a pile of bones?
GUMP: Tis not the wound, that's sure. Not a scar remains... we're talking about a spell; harder to repair than sword-work.
JACK: I'll do anything... face any challenge!
GUMP: Might not need a gesture quite so grand. What were you doing the very moment the Baron's curse fell on the world?
JACK: I was with the Princess.
GUMP: Where?
JACK: By the pond. She was teasing me.
GUMP: Go on... go on...
JACK: She tossed her ring in the pond and bid me fetch it. Said she'd marry me if I did.
GUMP: And did you?
JACK: Nay. It was lost. When I came up for air the pond was frozen over.
GUMP: That's it then... the ring!
GUMP: You must find the ring... It completes the cycle; answers the riddle...
JACK: I'll try.
GUMP: You're good at riddles... Find the ring and the spell is broken.
JACK: Your fond wishes give me strength, dear friends.
SCREWBALL: No speeches! What's a little swim after sticking worms and ogres?
