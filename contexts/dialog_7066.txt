VOGELSANG: Guy says he made the trade in Gillette, Wyoming sometime in the fall of oh-nine.
MAX: Then what?
VOGELSANG: Then what? That's it. That's all I got.
MAX: Nothing on Hannah?
VOGELSANG: A nuclear airburst wipes out every record of every kind in every computer east of the Rockies, and you want me to find some woman you met when you were seven, whose last name you don't even know... Maybe if you could give me something more on her...anything you can remember, some detail...
MAX: She was a nurse. She must've lived near there, somewhere, near the... ...the clinic. There must be some registry of nurses or medical technicians or whatever for Wyoming.
VOGELSANG: Only a last name would be nice. Or the nearest town to this...clinic.
MAX: What about the other kids? You get anything on them?
VOGELSANG: They don't exactly have a search engine for finding a bunch of kids with bar- codes on their necks, which is something I'm not even going to ask about--
MAX: You were gonna run through the law enforcement databases for a match on identifying marks.
VOGELSANG: Nothing so far from arrests, hospital admissions or coroners. This kind of search...it's heavy spadework. I'm gonna need--
MAX: More money... Like I'm shocked to hear you say that.
