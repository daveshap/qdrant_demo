Student Affairs Grad Personal Statement
I'm sorry if this is obnoxious, but I'm applying for a couple grad school programs, and I was wondering if anyone would be willing to read over a personal statement of mine. I've been rejected once before, and am anxious not to have that happen again. 

Thanks!
