NICOLET: What's going on?
DARGUS: She wants to make a deal.
NICOLET: She sound scared?
DARGUS: She almost sounds scared.
NICOLET: What's she want?
DARGUS: She wants to go back to work.
NICOLET: What's she willing to give us?
DARGUS: She hasn't one into specifics yet, she's been waiting for you.
NICOLET: She knows it's my case?
DARGUS: She ain't said it, but she's not stupid, she knows it's you who wants her.
NICOLET: Thanks for waiting, Jackie. Now tell me, what can we do for you?
JACKIE: I need permission to leave the country so I keep my job.
NICOLET: We can look into that.
JACKIE: I need it tomorrow. If I don't show up for work tomorrow, I'm fired.
NICOLET: You know what we want.
JACKIE: If I'm working, I can help you.
DARGUS: Help us do what?
JACKIE: Help you get Ordell Robbie.
NICOLET: Oh, so now you know him?
JACKIE: You never asked me if I did or not.
DARGUS: But now you're telling us now you do.
JACKIE: 'Course I do -- I deliver money for him.
NICOLET: No shit. You know how he makes his money?
JACKIE: He sells guns.
NICOLET: You ever see him sell guns?
JACKIE: No.
NICOLET: Then how do you know he sells guns?
JACKIE: He told me. Besides, why else would an A.T.F. man be after him?
NICOLET: How can you help us?
JACKIE: Short of wearing a wire, I'll do everything I can to help you throw his ass in jail. And in exchange for my help, I need permission to leave the country and immunity.
DARGUS: You don't want much, do you?
JACKIE: Can you do it or not?
