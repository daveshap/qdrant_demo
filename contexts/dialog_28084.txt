LUCY: What did you say?
SAM: Vampires, Mom! Everywhere! You've got to tell the police! The newspapers! The TV stations! They'll listen to you. They'll believe you... you're a <u>mom</u>!
LUCY: Not funny, Sam!
SAM: This is not a joke. They know that we know about them. They're coming to the house as soon as it gets dark!
LUCY: Stop it, Sam. Stop it right now!
SAM: But, Mom...
LUCY: Not another word! I can't believe you're doing this. I'm going to see Max tonight and you're trying to ruin it for me again.
SAM: No, I'm not...
LUCY: There's nothing wrong with Max. I don't know why you don't --
SAM: -- I'm not talking about Max! To hell with Max!
