EMMA: Dinner, Hubert.
HUBERT: I'll bear that in mind... What? Oh. Dinner. Pet--my stomach couldn't hold a bird seed.
EMMA: We're waiting, Hubert.
HUBERT: Really, my dear--I don't feel like a thing.
EMMA: Nonsense.
PETER: What's the matter, Dad? Is it getting you down?
HUBERT: Is *what* getting me down?
