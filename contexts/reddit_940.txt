Does hearing the sentence "I have bad news" make your anxiety shoot through the roof?
I *hate* when someone tells me that they have bad news. My stomach drops and all kinds of terrible scenarios run through my head. And 99% of the time the "bad news" ends up being something trivial like the grocery store is out of garlic powder. I wish people didn't use that phrase so lightly.
