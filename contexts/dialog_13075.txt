MARY: Fuck you, you fucking freak!
OTIS: Oh, come now... we're all creatures of God and freaks in our own way... ...but if you'll notice... right here, needs a little something, heh?
MARY: What are you doing? ...no, stop... please, please.
OTIS: You, my dear worm feeder, are about to become immortalized.
