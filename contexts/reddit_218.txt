Second guessing my friendships
I'm in a situation where I'm 2nd guessing my group of friend. I feel like they tont give a crap about me, and that we've just grown apart. I feel like I've grown or them, and I dont know if to continue holding on or not, since I have no friends at my grade, I often hang out with seniors or college friends (I'm a HS junior). And I'm scared of having no one next year
