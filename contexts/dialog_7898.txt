ED: Sorry to bother you while we're shooting, but the guy who owns the stage needs his money.
LORETTA: Well then you should pay him, shouldn't you?
ED: Yeah. Exactly!
ED: I kinda need it now.
LORETTA: What are you looking at me like that for? I already gave you my three hundred.
ED: Yeah. Well I need the other sixty-thousand.
LORETTA: What other sixty-thousand?
ED: The other sixty-thousand you said you'd give me.
LORETTA: You misunderstood. I gave you everything I have in the world: Three-hundred dollars.
