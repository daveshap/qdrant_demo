What's the easiest way to run GUI apps on Windows Subsystem for Linux as of 2018? I searched around, and currently there are two methods suggested; installing an enhancement for Windows Subsystem for Linux and installing an XServer.I want to know which method is the most hassle-free (easy to install AND to use), and which one is less memory-heavy.I just want Synaptic and CMake. Why couldn't that be a builtin feature?
