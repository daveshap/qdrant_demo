BUNNY: What’s going on with you two?
KAT: I was pretty hard on her last night. And now she’s getting married.
BUNNY: There’s a reason I always tell that Tony Pee-Pants story, you know.
KAT: Trust me. This is bigger than Tony Pee-Pants.
BUNNY: Before Tony, you and your sister were best friends. I couldn’t split you up. If your sister ate the spinach, you ate the spinach. If you threw up--.
KAT: Mom, please.
BUNNY: Anyway, when that boy came over, it was the first time you ever did anything without her. And Amy wasn’t just jealous...she was sad and lonely. She missed you.
KAT: She did?
BUNNY: So she flirted with Tony, and you got mad and sent him away. Who did that leave? You and Amy. Reunited.
