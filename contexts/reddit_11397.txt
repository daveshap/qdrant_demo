My mum has cancer
Just phoned up my mum for mothers day and found out she has recently been diagnosed with cancer. Luckily it's a very treatable kind, I forget the name of it right now, but she has a good chance of getting better. She's going to have to go in to have chemotherapy and radiotherapy next week. She'd prefer I didn't visit her for 2 weeks because it's going to be very intense. It is quite a lot to deal with and I felt selfish for getting upset on the phone. She is positive and dealing with it well, which is the main thing. I just have to try and be positive and look forward to when she will be better.
