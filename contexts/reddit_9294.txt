I will officially go through 2019 out of cc debt.
i finally bit the bullet and paid off the remainder of my cc debt which was about $2k. i’m sick of having to account the monthly payment into my budget. it was 0% interest but i wanted to start the new year off right instead of dragging it out another year. i finally got some cushion in my funds, and i saw someone say money in the bank with debt isn’t really money in the bank. so i will be sure to be quite frugal over the next month or two until i can build back up to where i was. never again will i aimlessly purchase things i cannot afford and let in accumulate. it’s over, finally.
