LORA: I'm afraid it's a little late for that. Dillinger's shut off Group 7 access. He must know what you're up to.
FLYNN: Boy, I bet I know who's workin' late tonight.
ALAN: Dillinger?
FLYNN: Yeah. Tryin' to find the file and erase it. Once that's gone, ain't nothin' can stop him. Just Eddie and his Master Control Program, runnin' things from on high..
LORA: Don't even say that. You've got to find that file before he does..
FLYNN: Not much chance of that now. The MCP can just slip it into another system as soon as it locates it...
ALAN: Not if my Tron program was running. That would seal the system off. If your file's in there...
FLYNN: Boy, if we were inside, I know how to forge us a Group 6 access...
