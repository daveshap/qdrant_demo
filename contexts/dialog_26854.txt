HERBERT GREENLEAF: No, Marge doesn't know the half of it.
RIPLEY: I think it might hurt her to know.
HERBERT GREENLEAF: And his passport photo? Did you hear? To scratch out your own face like that -- can you imagine -- the frame of mind you'd have to be in? I've thought about going to the police but I can't face it. I can't face anything anymore.
RIPLEY: I feel guilty. I feel like I pushed him away. I spoke and he heard you.
HERBERT GREENLEAF: Well, if we all pushed him away what about him pushing us away? You've been a great friend to my son. Everything is someone else's fault. We all want to sow wild oars. Somebody's got to -- what's the word? The moment someone confronts him he lashes out. He lashes out. You know, people always say you can't choose your parents, but you can't choose your children.
RIPLEY: I'm sorry. I was asleep. I must have fallen asleep.
PETER: You look ghastly, Tom. Are you okay?
MARGE: Did Dickie's Dad go?
RIPLEY: He's having an early night.
MARGE: Poor man. We were knocking on that door for ever. I think I've broken my strap.
PETER: Not guilty.
RIPLEY: I'll fix some drinks.
