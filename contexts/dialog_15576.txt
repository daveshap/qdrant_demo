KASHAG MEMBER: Your Prime Ministers, support the proposal that you return to Lhasa. On the opposite hand, some officials urge you not to return. They believe you should leave now, for India.
TENZIN GYATSO: If I were to go into exile, could we expect any serious assistance, from India, suppose?
LORD CHAMBERLAIN: It is unlikely. America, perhaps. There is great anti-communist feeling in America.
TENZIN GYATSO: At this point, the most likely result of a foreign pact is war.
LORD CHAMBERLAIN: The Chinese would see such a pact as an open declaration of war.
TENZIN GYATSO: Tibet, at war? No. China is close, America is far away. After countless people die, China would still, always, be close. We will work with what we have.
