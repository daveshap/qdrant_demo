TERRY: He followed my birds into their coop. Here, you want him?

JOEY: I'll see you on the roof.
MUTT: Tippi-tippi-tim, tippi-tim, Tippi-tippi-tan, tippi-tan... Gotta dime for a crippled-up docker?

MUTT: A dime, Terry, a dime for a cup of coffee?
TERRY: Don't give me that coffee, you rummy. Now blow!
MUTT: Thanks for nothing, you bum.
