JEFFREY: Kat, wait. I don’t want you hating me. We’ve never had this talk. You know how crap I am at this.
KAT: Um, news flash: I don’t give a shit.
JEFFREY: Kat, stop it. You do. You can’t even look me in the eye. You went back to the States when we split up.
KAT: That was a long time ago.
JEFFREY: It was. And it took your sister getting married to get you back here.
KAT: So, what’s your point?
JEFFREY: I should have told you why I broke up with you. I was a coward. You deserve to know.
NICK: Hey, man.
JEFFREY: Sorry, can you give us a moment?
NICK: No, I can’t. We’re late for a dance lesson. I guess you’ll have to finish up later.
NICK: Hello, goodbye, I want you, I hate you. It’s all just words. None of it means anything. What matters is what you do. You either stay put or you walk away. If you look back, you’re not walking away!
KAT: Oh, cut the crap!
NICK: I just hate seeing you so stuck.
KAT: He was about to un-stick me! I paid you to help me get closure.
NICK: You paid me for a lot of reasons. Closure wasn’t one of them.
