What is inscribed around the muzzle of Deadpool's gun? In the James Bond-style opening credits of Deadpool 2, there's a moment where Deadpool points a pistol directly at the camera. There's something written there in engraved letters around the muzzle of the gun. I'm pretty sure it said \"SMILE\" along the upper edge, but I couldn't make out the rest of it - there seemed to be a few words at the bottom edge.What does it say, and is this just a one-off joke, or a canonical thing that's always written on Wade's guns?
