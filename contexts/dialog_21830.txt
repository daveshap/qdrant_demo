DR. WINTON: Well, she finally let me look in her mouth. Is it true she's never been to a dentist?
MOTHER: She was raised on a poor dirt farm. I'm sure she's never seen a dentist or hardly even a doctor.
DR. WINTON: Well, she has one mouth in ten thousand, I don't see teeth like that once in ten years. Her trouble is an impacted wisdom tooth, but there isn't a cavity in her head, not a single one. She has perfect teeth.
MOTHER: But the wisdom tooth will have to be pulled?
DR. WINTON: Yes, and it's very bad. It probably should be done at the hospital under general anesthesia.
MOTHER: That would scare her to death. She's terrified of hospitals. To her, a hospital is where you go to die.
DR. WINTON: I think you're right, it would be harder on her. But you'd better call Mr. Hillyer, she's going to need help to get home.
ROSE: Never again, never again...
MOTHER: I know it was bad, honey. I'm sorry...
ROSE: No more dentists, no more dentists...
MOTHER: It'll get better now.
DADDY: Good morning, Rose. And how do you feel today?
ROSE: Wonderful. Except I can touch the place back there with my tongue, I wouldn't even know I had that tooth pulled.
DADDY: Well, I know it, I just got the bill for it.
ROSE: Boy, for four or five days there I didn't think I'd live. But I'm my old self again!
DADDY: Umm. Well. Yes. But no more strange voices in the night, Rose.
ROSE: Oh, no, sir.
MOTHER: Rose has learned her lesson, haven't you, Rose?
ROSE: Yes, ma'am.
