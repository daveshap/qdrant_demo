Lock screen without blank in 18.04 I'm running Ubuntu 18.04 on a laptop. When I lock the computer, I want the screen to remain on indefinitely. I do want the computer to lock automatically when it is idle (but still, the screen should remain on).First I tried in Settings -> Power to set Blank Screen to never, but that did not work. I have tried the suggestions from others who asked the same question here, but they are for different versions of Ubuntu and none of them worked for me.Does anyone know how to fix this problem in 18.04?
