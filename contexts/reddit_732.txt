I want to talk about bigger topics
I know there's a small chance this will reach anyone but here it goes. I want to talk about bigger things, but I'm just a teen. Maybe I've been watching to many ted-talks but, as I watch more and more of them I've gotten the urge to speak out about my views on stuff. When I say stuff I want to start conversations about taboo topics. I've tried having discussions about it with friends but they get bored and it's really discouraging. I want to spread awareness for things that not many people are talking about, or they haven't had much recognition when talked about. I want to make my voice heard but I don't know how. 

Tdlr; anyone have any tips to get their voice out there as a teen?
