I'm scared of the full time job I'm about to start soon.
I start a full time job at a restaurant soon, and it's actually more close to 7~4 so I'll be working a lot. I don't know how I'm going to be able to manage standing such a long time multiple days a week. I don't know how I'm going to have a consistent sleeping schedule. This job isn't even related to my major, so it won't be a job that is going to define my career, so I am not personally excited for it at all. Has anyone ever worked full time at a restaurant before? How did you manage your life outside of work on such a physically demanding job? Seems like all I'll want to do after my shift is to just come home and chill for the rest of the day. Not to mention I'll probably have weekend shifts so all my future plans are ruined.
