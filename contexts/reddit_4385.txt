An algorithm to help people with depression
UPDATE: *I have the 50 responses I wanted for this first week! I can't believe how fast I got them. I am humbled and thankful for the Redditt community! I love this place already. Thank you. I am so happy that I'll keep collecting info until I get to 100. Then I'll see if I'm overwhelmed with work, lol. Please follow me! I want to keep doing stuff like this for the community! THIS IS SO MEANINGFUL TO ME. YOU HAVE NO IDEA.*   


Hey There!  :)

I built an algorithm to help people with mental health. It is pretty cool.

I am an anonymous therapist that is tech savvy. I built an algorithm to analyze peoples needs and then compare it to the progress of other people with the same profile. Then it generates meaningful tips that emails people free advice based on what helped other similar people.

The recommendations from my algorithm have been helpful to me and to others. So I run it for other people for free (it's a strange hobby I know, but I like to do it). I have to put the data in manually, so I use google forms to collect your info and I enter it manually later. You can fill it out totally anonymously.

Fill out this google form and I will enter your data and email a list of 7 online resources that may help you. I can do more, but it is a bit of work. lol

Each response is personalized just for you! Know that this isn't a generic test. You'll get personalized resources that helped people who have a similar profile as you.

I only do 50 of these emails per week. So fill this out at the beginning of the week to maximize your chances of getting recommendations.

I hope this helps! Let me know if it does! I love feedback.

ps - no, I'm not a robot. But I just made this Reddit account to anonymously post this. Lets see if it works. :)

PLEASE UPVOTE. I JUST STARTED USING REDDIT AND IT WOULD BE COOL TO GET SOME KARMA. :)
