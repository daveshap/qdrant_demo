Antonym of nature, that implies the cities and infrastructure constructed by man I want to use a noun to describe the buildings and roads etc constructed by man ... as opposed to the forest and sea that exist on Earth naturally. Something besides \"man-made\".ETA: Many of the answers take the examples too literally. I mean to say everything constructed or caused by humans. Not specifically the roads and buildings, not a particular object, nothing in context of a city, or organisation.I want a generalised term, but also not a collective noun like 'assemblage' ... like nature implies everything not created by us and isn't a collective noun.A word that can fit into this sentence :\"I took a brief retreat from (the) ______ (created by man) to enjoy the Earth gifted to us by Nature.\"
