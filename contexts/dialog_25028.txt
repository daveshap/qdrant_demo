HARRY: Ooooh. Your feet are on fire.
PETER: Harry…
HARRY: Harry Osborne diminishes the stature of the University.""
PETER: Let me guess. The hunting dogs. You lost your scholarship.
HARRY: Scholarship students must maintain dignity at all times.""
PETER: I know. I've got one too.
HARRY: Screw scholarships! Universities are death! They make slaves of us all with their fetid ideas! Burn 'em down, I say!
PETER: Great idea. Let me get some shoes. I'll take you home.
HARRY: Why home? The real world beckons, man! The possibilities are endless. Want to go up to the World Trade Center and laugh at New Jersey?
HARRY: You're so responsible it's disgusting. But you're my only friend... do you hate me?
PETER: Don't be pitiful.
HARRY: I am not pitiful! I am the bridge to the Übermensch!
