Went on 4 dates in 2 weeks!!!
Hey guys, I am a 22M with one paralyzed arm. I just went on 4 dates in 2 weeks and wanted to share my experience.

I  have recently moved to Canada and don't know anyone here really and  decided to give tinder a try to see how it goes(in the country i came  from it was really dry to say the least). Anyway, to my surprise girls  were more responsive and were willing t go out(I am not exotic or  anything like that). Went on a date with one girl, it was okay, really  formal, got ghosted after that. Went out with the second girl the next  day and we had a really good connection, touching each other and stuff  like that. Unfortunately she lives in a nearby town and only comes to my  town for work, and got a horrible disease recently that put her in a  hospital. We still chat but she doesn't have time to date, but i will of  course go out with her if she wants. Went out with one more girl, again  something was off but it wasn't bad, but we stopped talking. The final  girl i met at a bar, while the others were all at a cafe, and this girl  was really quiet. It was like i had to pull words out of her, maybe she  was nervous , but she messaged me later saying that i am a great guy but  she had no time due to work lol.

What  these 4 dates did for me is that they gave me a huge confidence boost  and that it's okay if it doesn't work out. But I still need to work on  my first impressions. Also, how can i bring up my one arm cause you can  only see that its paralyzed in pictures if you take a look at it. I told  every girl beforehand though, just don't know how to properly bring it  up, or if i need to at all.
