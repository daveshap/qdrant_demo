BUMSTEAD: I met a friend of yours the other night, doctor. Tall fellow. No hair. Rather pale skin...
SCHREBER: I don't know what you're talking about.
BUMSTEAD: That's surprising. He was leaving your office at the time...
SCHREBER: You are mistaken.
WHITE: What are you hiding?
SCHREBER: Nothing. I don't know anything!
SCHREBER: Please, they'll kill me...
BUMSTEAD: I think it's time you introduced us to your little friends.
SCHREBER: In there.
BUMSTEAD: Just like that?
BUMSTEAD: What is this place?
SCHREBER: You wouldn't believe me if I told you, Inspector. Have patience - you'll see for yourself.
