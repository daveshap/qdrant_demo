He's hung up on somebody else?
So, I met this guy on Hinge and it honestly was off to such a great start. Had two dates and they both went very well, we talked for hours on end with no awkwardness to the point where we both admitted damn... this is going way better than we thought. And then of course, after the second date (yes, we had sex that night for the first time... it was great) we were still talking over text and all was well. He told me he trusted me and even went on to tell me some personal issues that he didn’t have to tell me but I encouraged him to if he felt the need, which he did. It seemed as though he was taking me seriously, and I was taking him seriously despite the eventual hookup.

Anyways, he messaged me a couple days after saying that he fell for someone back in his home town before moving out here, and that he thought he had moved on and was ready to date but realized he wasn’t. He said he has feelings for me and doesn’t want to hurt me in any way, but that he didn’t want to waste my time. I was obviously pretty upset because he was the first guy in a long time that I could actually get along with and felt comfortable with. All he really said was that he needed time to himself... I can’t help thinking that it was something to do with me?? I’m kind of hoping he’ll come around and we could try again once he’s figure his stuff out... at the same time I only really knew him for maybe a couple weeks, but it sucked because he’s a good guy. Thoughts? Opinions?

We left the conversation at that, I told him he could reach out to me whenever and to take care of himself... so like... that’s it???? Should I still have some hope???? Ahhhhh I'm a hopeless romantic and this one kind of hurt despite the circumstances


Edit: he texted me today lmao but yeet
