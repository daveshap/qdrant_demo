Rekeying a Schlage Connect smart lock So my wife finally gave me permission to go ahead and buy a smart lock to add to the rest of our growing smart home gadgets. I'm looking at the Schlage Connect. We currently have a separate deadbolt and doorknob, both with locks that use the same key. They have \"Dexter by Schlage\" branding on them.My question is- if I replace the deadbolt with the Schlage Connect and the doorknob itself with a non-locking options (else you could lock yourself out if that one gets locked and you depend upon the keypad to get in!), can I replace the pins in the Schlage Connect with those from the previous deadbolt so I can continue to use the same key?
