Does anyone else fear phonecalls?
Basically, I have to admit, I struggle with calls, whether it's incoming or if I have to make one. I become all hot and shivery all of the sudden, and I can feel my pulse going nuts. It's something confronting, "putting you on the spot" about calls, that makes me extremely nervous - it's like taking oral exam without having prepared for it. Can anyone relate? Does anyone have ideas on why this fear might exist or how to overcome it?
