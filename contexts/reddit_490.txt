Feel bullied by parents
Here is some background: i am a preteen going into 7th grade. my parents are divorced and have split custody. I see them each half the week. My mother has a boyfriend who I will refer to as R, who is very close to my brother, S. I have always been close to my dad and go to him for advice but I am being kept at my moms house for later explained reasons. 

 R and S have always been fans of teasing me. In the beginning it was okay but became personal. I told them it makes me feel upset but they continue. R is a believer in tough love and thinks I'm too sensitive. S is sexist towards me and this behavior is encouraged by R. Many times have I told my mother about this but she is too engaged in her phone to even hear me. Today I tried to bring it up to them as a group. R dismissed my feelings quickly. This is another thing they like doing a lot. I'm very sensitive and any time I cry or get upset they yell at me and berate me for being sad. My mother has threatened to hit me before just for crying when she yells at me. Well because of my sensitivity I started crying and they yelled at me. I told them I wanted to go to my dads house and they said I have to stay here and are not letting me leave. My mother even said I'm taking things too personally and overreacting and she yelled at me so now I'm hiding in the bathroom where they can not yell at me.

 I feel so ganged up on, mistreated, and bullied. I feel helpless to express my feelings to them and need advice on how to move forward in this situation.
