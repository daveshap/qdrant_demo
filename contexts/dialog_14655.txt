ELLEN: You're damn right I'm serious....
MICHAEL: I'm just getting started....
ELLEN: I don't want you in the water anymore....
MICHAEL: Mom, you're upset. Sit down...Please....
ELLEN: I won't have anyone in my family any- where near the water.... Never again...Never....
MICHAEL: Hey, come on, you can't believe that voodoo. Sharks don't commit murder. They don't pick out a person....
ELLEN: It picked Sean...It killed your father....
