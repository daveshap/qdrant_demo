SANDRO: Really, I've got to stop this business with Ettore... I would like to go back and start working on my own projects again. You know, I had many ideas...
CLAUDIA: And why did you drop them?
SANDRO: Once they gave me a job to draw up an estimate for the construction of a school. It took me only a day and a half to finish it, and I got paid six million lire. Ever since then I've been doing estimates for other people's designs.
SANDRO: Why are you looking at me like that?
CLAUDIA: I'm sure you'd be able to design some very lovely things.
SANDRO: I don't know about that. And then, who's interested in beautiful things nowadays?
SANDRO: Claudia, let's get married?
CLAUDIA: What! Get married?
SANDRO: Yes. We'll get married. You and I. What do you say?
CLAUDIA: What do I say? What can I say? No. At least, not yet. I don't know... I can't even think of it... at a time like this... Oh, but why did you have to ask me?
SANDRO: You look at me as though I had said something foolish...
CLAUDIA: And are you sure you want to marry me? Are you really sure...that you want to marry... me?
SANDRO: That's why I asked you...
CLAUDIA: So... Oh, how I wish that everything were so much simpler... that people could just come together by the color of their hair or the size of their shoes. What size shoe do you wear? Size 9. That's a very lovely size. But I'm sorry, I wear size 8.
