I get anxiety during anxiety about myself wasting my life having anxiety and not being able to enjoy it. Wasting precious time. Literally anxiety about anxiety? How do I break this loop?
I get the physical sensations of anxiety each morning I wake up. Doesn’t matter what I do. CBT, meditation, mindfulness, meds (although no more) etc.

This in turn sets the tone for the day no matter what I do, then I get upset that I always feel like my body thinks it’s dying in fight or flight.

It drains me and fatigues me and then I make mistakes at work and affects my attention span. 

Then I always end up being in a state of having more anxiety because I’m scared about always having anxiety..
