LLOYD: But it can't be! We can't be out of gas! I filled it myself yesterday! Wasn't it full when you drove to Brewster this morning?
KAREN: I guess I didn't look. You know I don't pay attention to those things...
LLOYD: Incredible.
MARGO: How much time have we?
KAREN: Roughly ten minutes.
MARGO: How far to the station?
KAREN: Three or four miles...
MARGO: Any houses or farms around where we can borrow gas?
KAREN: None in sight, there aren't many along this back road...
MARGO: Not many car either, not much chance of a lift...
