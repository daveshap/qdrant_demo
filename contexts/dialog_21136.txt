MITCHELL: I'm afraid you're not very glad to see me, Margo.
MARGO: With your charm? How could I help it? Have a nice trip?
MITCHELL: So-so.
MARGO: Who's the girl?
MITCHELL: Her name's Mayfield. Betty Mayfield.
MARGO: Nice.
MITCHELL: She's just a girl I met on the train. You don't mind do you?
MARGO: Why should I mind?
MITCHELL: You shouldn't. You washed me up very thoroughly.
MARGO: As thoroughly as I could. It wasn't easy. But you are helping me.
MITCHELL: Margo, darling. You washed me up. Remember? We're just friends. You wanted it that way.
MARGO: She's very beautiful. She's much younger than I am. And she's rich, I hope.
MITCHELL: Rich? I haven't the faintest idea. Why?
MARGO: You ought to know why.
MITCHELL: I don't. My hunch is she's just torn up an unhappy marriage. I was able to do her a small favor.
MARGO: Splendid. Now she can return the compliment.
