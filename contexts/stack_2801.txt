Footage of SHG in smoke/fog I am looking for a footage of second harmonic generation performed with laser and a non-linear crystal in which infrared light is converted to visible light. But I also want that to be performed in smoke or fog so that the laser beam is \"visible\" (or rather visualized). Such setup would be a very good demonstration of the phenomenon of the frequency doubling. Sadly, I only found the footage of the demonstration without the smoke, but in such setup the SHG doesn't look different from simple light scattering on the crystal.Can you provide me with any links to the footage as described above, that undoubtedly demonstrates the frequency doubling?
