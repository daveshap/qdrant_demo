Nexus card interview questions, not living in Canada yet? I got my Canadian PR 6 months ago but haven't moved there yet. I am living in US since last 8 years and this makes me eligible for Nexus card. I will be giving my interview this week. I would like to know people's experiences with these interviews and the kind of questions they ask. My main objective in getting the Nexus card is the possibility of using fast lanes during land/air travel. I am already conditionally approved but worried about CBSA asking residency questions (I still have 2.5 years technically to live outside Canada and still satisfy RO).
