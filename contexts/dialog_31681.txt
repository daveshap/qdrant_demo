GIBBONS: Thought you bought the farm down there, X. Glad as hell to see you.
XANDER: I'm pretty happy to see me too. So are you done with me yet?
GIBBONS: You've kept up your end of the bargain, I'll do the same. But you really should consider staying on, you make a decent agent.
XANDER: But I hate cops, remember? Except for her.
GIBBONS: Cut the crap, X, I saw you down there. You're a hero. Don't be afraid to join the good guys.
XANDER: Who says you're the good guys?
GIBBONS: You know what they say, the only way to change the system is from the inside.
XANDER: Oh yeah? Why don't we start by taking this thing off my ankle? The poison needles?
GIBBONS: On come on, X. Did you really think we were that barbaric?
XANDER: No needles, huh? What about the acid bath?
GIBBONS: All for show. Just a psychological mind game to get you to do the right thing.
XANDER: You're a jerk-off, you know that?
