What are the pros and cons of the Standing Rock pipeline?
A pipeline is proposed to be built in Standing Rock in North Dakota and protests are happening to block it.

Many of my Facebook friends are "checking in" in order to support protesters who are attempting to block the construction of the oil pipeline. I really don't know much about the issue and every article I read seems to have a strong bias so I've decided to come here.

For the sake of sensible discussion I'll break my post into sub-questions:

1. Did the people building the oil pipeline follow a legal process? Is that process fair?

2. What are the benefits of building the pipeline?

3. What are the drawbacks of building the pipeline?

4. Will the pipeline create a net positive impact? Who are the winners and who are the losers?

5. [This article](http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/29/us/dakota-pipeline-standing-rock-sioux/index.html) suggests that a lot of the protesters are flooding in from other states (and will not be directly affected by the outcome of a seemingly local decision). Is this a good or bad precedent?
