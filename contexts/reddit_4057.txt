Realizing someone lost interest in you feels bad
So I started seeing this girl since novembre and at first it seemed like we are equally enthusiastic about each other, being responsive to text messages and making sure we see each other once a week. 

We didn't spend New Years together, haven't had much contact with her since, except some smalltalk about her moving to a new place and her going to the cinema with someone to watch a movie we didn't even consider watching on a date (hmm...)

While I obviously wish it is because she is stressed out due to moving and work, its 2019 and I know she is online and could just leave me a quick response, so I am doubtful that I'll see or hear much of her anymore. Still it kinda sucks that people cannot tell you when they lose interest and silently leave you hanging there instead: 

this morning I woke up and felt bad, thought to myself how shitty it is that I feel like I cannot function properly for such a stupid reason.

Kinda torn between straight out not engaging in that person/contact anymore or to at least wait out her moving places before I make my decision. Sry for the rant, had to vent some stuff
