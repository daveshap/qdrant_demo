Should I disclose my furloughed status to potential employers?
Hi All,

Hoping I can ask your advice.

I am currently furloughed due to the COVID19. They made it clear that this was not performance based and the intention was to bring furloughed employees back once they could. Basically everyone on my particular team was furloughed either partially or fully.

I've been taking this time off to try and explore next steps within my career and how to improve. I've applied to some jobs and have started hearing back. I have a story ready on why I'd like these particular roles (want to get into a role more focused on marketing), but should I also disclose the fact that I am currently furloughed to appear upfront and honest?

Look forward to hearing your thoughts!

Eric
