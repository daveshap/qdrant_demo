Advice for pursuing a career in academic advising please!
Hello everyone, I am a first year undergrad student interested in becoming an academic advisor in higher education. I would greatly appreciate any advice/answers provided! :)

I have been doing some research on the path to this career with the general understanding that I must earn a masters in higher education administration + student affairs and also acquire relevant experience. 

Here are some of the questions I am struggling to find answers to:

* What is a preferable major to earn in undergrad? Would a major such as sociology be suitable/desired as a supplement to the masters degree? Does your undergrad major matter at all?

* What exactly should I do after earning my undergraduate degree? Do I apply for a smaller position at a university and work for a year or two before pursuing a graduate degree or go straight from undergrad to grad school? 

* How long can one expect to wait before finding a job as an academic advisor after earning a masters degree? 

* How is the transition from relevant experience to a first full on academic advising position? How does the training/prep for all the job duties work in this field?
