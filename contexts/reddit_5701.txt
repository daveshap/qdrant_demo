Current job said they will fire me if I don’t improve.
Okay, this situation is a little complicated.

TLDR: I’m about to get fired but it seems like a pretty amicable situation and my manger even promised a good review. I could likely collect unemployment. I have interviews lined up and need time off for that but there is no way I could get time approved. Can I just call in sick or will this hurt chances of unemployment / strain the remaining relationship I have with my current job?

My current job said they will terminate my employment if I do not improve by February 20th. I am trying my hardest because I always try not to burn bridges, but honestly this is kind of a blessing. I genuinely hate this job, and have already been searching elsewhere for new employment. 

Even if I do improve to their standards by the 20th, they then would want me to come in office which is simply not feasible as I live too far away (I work from home currently). So no matter what this current job is pretty much out the window. I would just leave on my own, but I can’t afford to lose my job without unemployment or another job lined up.

That being said, I have secured quite a few interviews for next week - unfortunately, the interviews are during when I’m supposed to be working my current job. My current job offers no PTO at all and any approved unpaid time off must be scheduled several **months** in advance. 

My main question is: **If I have to take 2 “sick days” in a row for these interviews, will my chances of unemployment be hurt?** I’m not sure what do. I obviously want to attend the interviews no matter what since losing this job is pretty much inevitable and I need to prepare, but I also don’t want to screw up my ability to collect unemployment if the interviews don’t work out. I know if people are obnoxiously late all the time or call in sick too often it can sometimes be considered termination for cause. I have 100% attendance besides this. Is 2 days enough of a cause? The speed of my performance is the reason they are wanting to let me go, but it was nothing that would make me seem completely negligent, just “not a good fit” for the role. I finish at about 80-85% of the speed they’re expecting from me. I don’t think my performance issues count as a cause by themselves. The can fire me for any reason as this is an at-will state, I’m just talking about “causes” in terms of unemployment. 

I’m also scared of going the route of telling my boss that I have interviews lined up and need time off for that. Getting fired is pretty much a guarantee so that isn’t the concern, it’s just that her and I still have a decent connection separate from my performance and she did previously agree to write a good review and a letter of recommendation for any future endeavors. I would hate to burn that too by just bailing, could even hurt my ability to get the jobs I’m interviewing for lol. 🤦🏻‍♀️

Help plz lol
