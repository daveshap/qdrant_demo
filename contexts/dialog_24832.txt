TAYLOR: Well, everything's running smoother than a baby's ass.
BARNES: Ain't it the truth. The two say nothing for a beat -
TAYLOR: So, are you on for the next one?
BARNES: I don't know. Everything's up in the air at this point, no pun intended.
TAYLOR: Why, didn't they say?
BARNES: Well that hotel begins construction in January, there's going to be a lot of shuttle work.
TAYLOR: You want to go back to shuttle work?
BARNES: It's steady, good benefits.
BARNES: You gotta think of your old age.
TAYLOR: That's very pragmatic of you, Barnes.
BARNES: Thank you.
TAYLOR: Man, I'm hungry. I'm going to call the steward, you want anything?.
BARNES: Nah, I already ate. Why don't you just go down there?
TAYLOR: What, and leave you here all by your lonesome?
BARNES: Uh...
BARNES: I think I can handle it.
TAYLOR: Well, maybe I will. You sure you don't want anything?
BARNES: No. I'm all set. Thanks.
TAYLOR: Well, maybe I'll surprise you.
BARNES: I can hardly wait.
MAC: Officer Taylor, how are you this evening?
TAYLOR: Mac. What's shaking?
