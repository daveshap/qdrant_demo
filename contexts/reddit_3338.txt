Do you ever wonder what the person you're going to end up with is doing?
Whenever I feel sad, alone, or frustrated, I think about him. I wonder where he is and what he's doing. I wonder if he's in a relationship right now. I wonder if he's happy or if he's miserable. I wonder if he wonders about me too. I think about how much I wish he were here with me and how I can't wait to finally meet him. I think about how all this bullshit will have been worth it if it's what leads me to him.

But sometimes I wonder if he even exists at all, or if he will forever remain a product of my imagination.
