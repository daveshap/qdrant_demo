NATHAN: What are you doing in there?
LILA: I'll be out in a minute.
NATHAN: I'm sorry about my parents.
LILA: You didn't seem sorry when you were laughing at all your mother's stupid, tasteless, cruel animal jokes.
NATHAN: I was simply attempting to keep the evening light. You know that I feel similarly to you about nature.
LILA: Do you?
NATHAN: Of course. I simply love the... naturalness of it all.
LILA: Do you? Oh do you, darling?
NATHAN: Why certainly!
LILA: Oh, darling. I'm so relieved. Let's celebrate with a long hike in the woods tomorrow!
NATHAN: That's a great idea.
LILA: It'll be wonderful! I'll show you my old stomping grounds!
NATHAN: Terrific. Can't wait!
NATHAN: Shaving cream?
LILA: I don't think so. Why?
NATHAN: Darling, did you bring the insect repellent lotion?
LILA: Yes, darling.
NATHAN: Oh, and the sun block?
LILA: Of course.
NATHAN: What SPF, sweetie?
LILA: Fifteen.
NATHAN: Perfectomundo! We are ready! Say, wouldn't it be wonderful to have an insect repellent lotion that also worked as a sun block? Think of all the time one would save.
LILA: Yes, darling.
NATHAN: I think I'll get Johannsen in chemistry on that. Oh! Did you bring the first aid kit?
LILA: Yes.
NATHAN: Flares?
LILA: Absolutely.
NATHAN: We could call it Quit Bugging Me
LILA: That's very funny.
NATHAN: I love you so much.
