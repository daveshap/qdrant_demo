JEROME: You almost sound like you believe that.
ANTON: Come with me now, Vincent. You've gone as far as you can go.
JEROME: There are a few million miles to go yet.
ANTON: It's over.
JEROME: Is that the only way you can succeed, Anton, to see me fail?
ANTON: It's for the best.
JEROME: God, even <i>you</i> want to tell me what I <i>can't</i> do. In case you hadn't noticed, Anton, I don't need rescuing. But <i>you</i> did, once.
JEROME: Well? You have all the answers. How is that possible?
ANTON: You didn't beat me that day. I beat <i>myself</i>.
JEROME: Who are you trying to convince?
ANTON: I will prove it to you. Come swim with me now, Vincent. Now--tonight.
