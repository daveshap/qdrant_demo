Issues getting an Interview. Any advice on how to get past the "program" that filters me out?
I have recently left my company after 2.5 years (yes during COVID.. I know). I had thought about leaving last September and browsed around but nothing hit. Well here I am jobless and not getting anything to hit. Can anybody give me advice?  


A little background on me. I graduated at the end of 2017 with a BS in EE. I didnt have a super great GPA or anything worth putting on my Resume (\~2.9). I got an interview through a friend I knew as it was his familys company. It went great and I got fantastic experience but now that I am searching I am not getting any hits. I have been applying for over a month now and have literally got 0 emails about any next steps and I apply to 5+ jobs daily.  


Can anybody give me some insight of what I can do differently?  


I am also on LinkedIn connecting with Recruiters constantly. Thanks
