Do you want people to keep ordering stuff for delivery so you can make some money or would you rather they didn't to reduce chance of getting coronavirus?
I'm not sure what is the right thing to do to help my community.

Edit: I'm financially secure and everyone in my house is low risk of getting very sick from coronavirus.
