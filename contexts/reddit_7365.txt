Did I mess up the negotiation?
Hello, 

I recently negitated my salary for an analyst position. The original offer was for 40k and they said they do yearly evaluations, so I countered with that I would be more comfortable with 45k or if that wasn't entirely possible to work in some sort of evaluation at 6 months or so.

They accepted my offer at 45k but said that their original intent was 40k with a 3 month offer so they would do 40k and waive the 3 month evaluation. I feel like I made the right call because at 3 months its hard to picture a 12.5% raise after 3 months.

Did I make the right call? I haven't signed anything yet. This is also my first job out of college I graduate this month. I just need someone to ease my worries. Thanks!
