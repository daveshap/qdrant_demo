I don’t know what I want to be when I grow up
I’m starting high school in like six months and I have to choose if I want an AP class or not. Now this seems pretty easy but not for me apparently. The high school teacher that teaches the course said “if this doesn’t help you in what you want to be when you grow up then don’t do it” this makes sense but I don’t know what I want to be. I thought I wanted to be a business owner but I don’t think I would enjoy that anymore, as it would have me interacting with people on a daily basis which isn’t what I like. I thought maybe I would like to be a mechanic but that would put my body under stress I don’t think I could take. I also want to do a sport which would take about 3 hours of study time away. And the course usually gives two or three hours of hw. I don’t know what I want to be and if taking an English or history course would help. I tried to take quizzes but those did not help at all. It just sucks because everyone knows what they want and I don’t. So if anyone could help I would appreciate it.
