DOUG: Chris, can you do me a favour?
CHRIS: What?
DOUG: Take the drill back to Honza at the office, I promised to get it back for the weekend and I don't want to show my face there.
CHRIS: You might make Henry happy......Sure, I'll do it.
DOUG: Good, and then type up a notice on your computer for tonight's thing, photocopy it and put it up in all the faculty buildings and a couple of the pubs. It'll start at eight o'clock and the bar will be open from seven. Holly and I'll go and get some beer and wine. Can you bankroll the bar for tonight?
HOLLY: Yeah, no problem.
CHRIS: We ain't going to give it away this time, are we?
DOUG: Shit no, it'll be twice cost.
CHRIS: You capitalist pig!
DOUG: The performance is free what more do you want....I've set that old phone up as a donation box and I'll get Jahn to write out a sign....Okay, let's get going.
CHRIS: Does Jahn's thing have a name?
DOUG: Hey Jahn.....You got a name for this thing?
