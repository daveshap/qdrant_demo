I got rid of Facebook and Instagram today after 8 years.
I couldn't feel better, it's like a weight has been lifted off me and alot of stressful ties cut. Now I can live in the real world without being too sucked into my phone, and the only people that can contact me are the people I want to be able to. For years I lived a very bad life, and now I feel safer it won't come back to bite me.
