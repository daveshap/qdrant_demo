I'm a week into the training for a new job, and feeling a little overwhelmed and threatened, afraid that I'm going to fail. Any advice?
I got a job in customer service. We're currently training in the routines, software, systems, rules and so on that we'll need once we get put out on the floor.

The training is good. And there's 9 other newbies right alongside me. I know that I'm not behind, at least not the furthest behind. We have test conversations where we get a real life scenario to solve, and from that it's clear that I'm not too terrible at using the software or searching in the routines.

 But there are a lot of routines and rules and things that I don't know. We've taken some customer calls, and I notice that I get stressed, which makes me go quick, which makes me go blank or do a poor job of searching the routines properly. 

It's just customer service, but it's much harder than I thought it would be, at least it seems that way right now. I'm just looking forward to when this all becomes habit, and I can come to work and comfortably and competently do my job. 

I never thought I was the type to write a *"tell me it's all going to be OK*" type post, but it's been a hard day, and I'm trying to keep a mindset of taking on the challenge, of working to improve, and to not fall into that despairing panic of "*I'm never going to be able to do a good job here*".
