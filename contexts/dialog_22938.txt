DIANE: Dad, maybe I shouldn't go with all that's happening to you.
JIM: You're going.
DIANE: But listen, if I had a friend in the same position, I would tell her to delay a year.
JIM: You're going.
DIANE: It doesn't feel right to me. I, I don't even have the right luggage yet.
JIM: Bon voyage.
DIANE: You're not listening to me.
JIM: Diane! Alright, let's stop this right now. Let's not put our energy into something ridiculous. This isn't even smart thinking.
DIANE: Dad, why are you acting this way? Is this because of the other morning?
JIM: Do you love him?
DIANE: I like him a lot.
JIM: Well listen to me. Now, I know you like him, I know he's nothing like those frat kids you can't stand, but honey, after the excitement wears off, then what, huh? What are you going to talk about? What do you have in common? You're going to be part of an international think-tank, and he's going to be kicking punching bags.
DIANE: Unbelievable. This is a nightmare.
JIM: Diane, you owe it to yourself to get on that plane with no attachments, no strings, because after you get over there, things are going to change. People change.
DIANE: Dad, you and I have talked about this. Lloyd and I have talked about this. Believe me, this is well-covered territory.
JIM: Diane, I'm not asking you to sever all relations with the boy. Give him a present, here, let him know you still care. Give him this pen.
DIANE: Dad, in a million years, I would never give him a pen. What's wrong with having some fun? I like him.
JIM: 'I like him'? Diane, I'm talking about being honest with people, being decent...
DIANE: Dad, I love him.
