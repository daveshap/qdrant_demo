The Proper way to email my supervisor as an incoming student.
I got admissions for an MSc program about two months ago and since then I haven't contacted my PI. 
Should I email some updates to my professor? (For example about my Visa process or ask details about Fall semester)
If so what can I write in the email? 
I donâ€™t know what is the proper and polite way to contact my professor. 
I would appreciate it if you could help me.
