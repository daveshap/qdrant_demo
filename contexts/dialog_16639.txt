PETER: You fucking bastard.
FATHER JAMES: Don't you get it? They had their 2,000 years. Now it's our turn.
PETER: So all that bullshit about God and faith.
FATHER JAMES: It was perfect. The harder I pushed, the more you pulled away.
PETER: You lied to me my whole life. Everything you said, everything you did.
FATHER JAMES: Everything I did, I did for you. I love you, Peter. Think of it. I'm giving you a gift, absolute power and knowledge.
PETER: You raised me, like a son.
FATHER JAMES: You are my son. Don't you see the opportunity that lies before you?
PETER: You killed my parents.
FATHER JAMES: I had to. There was no other way. Their deaths were part of the greatest legacy I could have given you.
