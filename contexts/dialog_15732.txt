CLARICE: Excuse me, but I really do need to talk to you. This was Mrs. Lippman's house. Did you know her?
MR. GUMB: Just briefly. What's the problem, Officer?
CLARICE: I'm investigating the death of Fredrica Bimmel. Who are you, please?
MR. GUMB: Jack Gordon.
CLARICE: Mr. Gordon, did you know Fredrica when she worked for Mrs. Lippman?
MR. GUMB: No. Wait... Was she a great, fat person? I may have seen her, I'm not sure...
MR. GUMB: Mrs. Lippman had a son, maybe he could help you. I have his card somewhere. Do you mind stepping inside, while I looks for it?
CLARICE: Thanks.
