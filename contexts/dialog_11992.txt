HANNAH: Here, Mom. Drink this. You know, you're awful. You probably were flirting.
NORMA: No! I like to joke around and have fun, and he gets angry because I get the attention. He's gotten sourer as he's gotten older, and I've tried to stay young...at heart.
HANNAH: You promised to stay on the wagon.
NORMA: The sacrifices I've made because of that man. He's ruined me with his ego, his philandering, his-- his-his-his-his mediocrity!
HANNAH: Okay, stop being so dramatic.
NORMA: He's the one that's made every ingenue in stock!
HANNAH: Okay, okay.
NORMA: Th-th-they, they wanted me for a screen test.
HANNAH: Yeah, I know, Mom. NORMA But I, I knew that he'd get up there and he'd flounder around with his expensive haircuts and hairdos and clothes. He's all show! Now how can you act when there's nothing inside to come out?!
