PRINCESS MARGARET: How are you?
WHALE: Fine. Quite fine. And Your Royal Highness?
PRINCESS MARGARET: Splendid. Now that I know you're around.
PRINCESS MARGARET: Can we get together while I'm in town? I so badly want to sit for you again.
WHALE: Sit?
PRINCESS MARGARET: I've changed my hair, you see. Since our last session. Those old snaps look rather dowdy now.
PRINCESS MARGARET: Oh dear. Have I made a blunder?
WHALE: Ma'am, the pleasure is all mine. James Whale.
PRINCESS MARGARET: I am such a goose. I mistook you for Cecil Beaton. It's the hat. You're wearing one of Cecil's hats, you know.
