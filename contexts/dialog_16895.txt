SIDNEY: Another one?
MALCOLM: How long has this been going on?
SIDNEY: All day since you and Betty left. Brother Minister, I have to level with you. They gave me a mission. But I couldn't do it. I love y'all.
MALCOLM: What mission?
SIDNEY: To wire your car so it would explode when you turned the ignition. The Ministers say you are spreading untruths about the Messenger. The Ministers say you are a great hypocrite, Judas, Benedict Arnold. The Ministers say your tongue should be cut out and delivered to the Messenger's doorstep.
MALCOLM: What does Sidney say?
SIDNEY: I'm with you, Brother Minister.
MALCOLM: No. You'll be marked for death.
SIDNEY: Let me die then.
MALCOLM: I won't let myself come between you and your father. Go home.
SIDNEY: You're my father.
MALCOLM: And don't come back.
