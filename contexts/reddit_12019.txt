I didn't get tested
This is a throw away account,

My ex gf cheated on me and I never got tested after that. I've been with my current gf for 2 years and we have never gotten tested while with each other. She's only ever had one previous boyfriend and they were only ever with each other. 

She has a doctors appointment coming up and we are both afraid of the Doctor, I told her last night about me not getting checked and she's been crying ever since. I'm an idiot and I feel like dying. I can't believe I was so careless and irresponsible. I don't know what to say or how to fix it. 

What if I have something and gave it to her? The first time I have an actual relationship that was working. I don't know how to feel or how to console her. I think it's over and I don't want it to be...
