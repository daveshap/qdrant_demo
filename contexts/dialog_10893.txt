C.O.: Yes, of course. Please, have a seat, lieutenant...
JORDAN: Thank you, sir.
C.O.: Would you care for a beverage? Tea?
JORDAN: I'm fine, sir.
C.O.: So. We're still coming to terms with the exact protocol for this -- for integrating the Spec-Recon training. It may not always be smooth, but we're trying to make it as painless as possible for you.
JORDAN: Thank you, sir. But I expect a certain amount of pain.
JORDAN: Barber was my next stop, sir. Would've had it regulation sooner, only --
C.O.: Don't worry about it. If it's off your collar and out of your eyes, that's all I'm going to ask.
JORDAN: Really, I have no problem with --
C.O.: I'm not out to change your sex, lieutenant. You'll have separate beds, separate heads. If you have specific medical needs, inform the infirmary. If a classmate or superior acts in an harassing or otherwise unbecoming manner, please inform me immediately so I can deal with it immediately. Questions?
JORDAN: None at this time, sir.
C.O.: Then that's all I have to say. Dismissed.
JORDAN: Sir, I just want you to know... I'm not here to make a statement. I don't want to make men look foolish. All I care about is completing the training and getting operational experience -- just like everyone else, I suspect.
C.O.: If you were like everyone else, lieutenant, I suspect we wouldn't be making statements about not making statements, would we? Take your leave.
