TSAI: Who are you?
BO: Wait! I'm a friend!
TSAI: I don't care about your sword.
BO: Why were you spying on the Yus?
TSAI: I'm looking for someone. Jade Fox. I'm a police inspector from Shaan Xi, Gen Su district. Jade Fox is a master criminal. I hear she infiltrated the Yus. She must have come with them when they transferred here. But with Yu's reputation, I can't just go in and accuse her.
BO: This Jade Fox is a woman?
TSAI: Yes.
BO: Then leave her to me.
TSAI: Pardon me, but I doubt you can handle her. My wife was quite a martial arts expert. Jade Fox killed her. So you see, this is personal. Leave her to me.
