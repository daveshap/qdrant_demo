Create a pivot table for m-n relationship in QGIS? My dataset comprises many polygons representing workspaces over a large area:-1 vector layer comprising my polygons (each polygon ID appears 1 time) For my online atlas however I need to obtain a pivot table layer as follows :-1 pivot table listing all the polygon couples less than 300 meters apart (each polygon ID appears over more than 1 line depending the nb neighbor polygons).I have no clue how to obtain this in QGIS.
