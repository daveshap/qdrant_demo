psa: please don’t feel obligated to write essays on personal trauma
for one of my mit essays i wrote about my abusive ex stepparent, a process which took the life out of me and unearthed a lot of memories i wanted to forget. now post-rejection, the sting is extra bad because i expended all of that emotional energy and set myself back for no real reason. please remember that these schools have no claim to your trauma, and that proper healing and processing is more important than just about anything. you’re a person before a college applicant.
