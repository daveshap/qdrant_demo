should I do a masters right after graduation or work for a couple of years first?
Hello all, 

I am going to graduate from a Canadian University (I am Canadian) and I was wondering if it is better to do a masters program right after graduation or work first according to the current job market? To give you a bit of context, I am studying health Science and I plan to either work for the government, research firms or whatever else I can with my degree. I have a good amount of work-related research experience, worked at a administrative assistant at a clinic and have multiple volunteering positions. 

I also was wondering what other type of jobs I can apply for with my degree (it is not really science based, mostly courses like health Econ, public policy, social determinants of health, etc.).

&#x200B;

Any advice will be appreciated!
