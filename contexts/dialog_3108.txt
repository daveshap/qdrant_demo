DICK: You can't-.
BRUCE: Dick, let go. Revenge will eat you alive. Trust me. I know.
DICK: But what about all the good we can do? There are monsters out there. Gotham needs us.
BRUCE: And when you finally get Two-Face?
BRUCE: Exactly. And once you'd killed him you'd be lost. Like me. All this has to be a choice. Otherwise...it's a curse.
DICK: Bruce, you can't.
BRUCE: Chase is coming for dinner. Why don't you join us.
