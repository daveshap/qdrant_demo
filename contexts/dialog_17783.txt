JAY: Kay--
KAY: Hang on. There's gotta be something on this guy. Did you contact the Alliance? Do they have anything?
ZED: I put word out-- you know how long it takes to get the signals across.
JAY: Kay. Seriously. What if he actually means what he says?
KAY: He's here to help!?
JAY: Yes. Well, in his own mind, yeah. What if, from his point of view, he is?
KAY: How does that help me?
JAY: Well... if you think about it, then it would mean that maybe everything he's saying is true.
KAY: Great. Fine. Listen, why don't we call the pentagon, maybe they'll take you back with the new age well wishers. I'll stay here and go extinct with the dinosaurs.
JAY: Kay. All I'm saying--
KAY: I know what you're saying. And I'm telling you I don't trust him--
JAY: I know you don't trust him. You don't trust anybody--
KAY: Cause I've been doing this thirty years and if I don't know when something doesn't feel right by now--
JAY: That's my point. For thirty years you've been looking through things and under things and behind things. Well what I'm saying is maybe this is a time where you should look right at things. He said our enemy in already here. Well maybe it is. Maybe our enemy is, literally, already here.
