BEN M'HIDI: What do you think of the strike, Ali?
ALI: I think it'll be a success ...
BEN M'HIDI: Yes, I think so too ... It's been organized well ... But what will the French do?
ALI: It's clear. They'll do everything possible to make it fail.
BEN M'HIDI: No, they'll do even more. We've given them the opportunity to do a lot more ... Do you understand what I mean? Starting tomorrow, they won't be groping in the dark any more; every shop and every worker who strikes will be a known enemy, a self-confessed criminal ... And they will be able to pass to the offensive. Have you thought of this?
ALI: No ...
BEN M'HIDI: But Kader told me that you weren't in favor of the strike.
ALI: No, and neither were my men.
BEN M'HIDI: Why?
ALI: Because they told us that we mustn't use weapons, now, when the time is right.
BEN M'HIDI: That's true ... Wars aren't won with terrorism, neither wars nor revolutions. Terrorism is a beginning but afterward, all the people must act ... This is the reason for the strike, and its necessity: to mobilize all Algerians, count them and measure their strength ...
ALI: To show them to the UN, right?
BEN M'HIDI: Yes ... yes. The problem also involves the UN. I don't know what it's worth, but this way, we'll give the UN the possibility of evaluating our strength.
