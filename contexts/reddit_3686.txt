How to cope with loneliness and desperation?
25 year old male here. I'm a software engineer, so I'm an introvert by default. Unfortunately, I'm also rather shy, though I've been doing a lot better at coming out of my shell. My friends tell me I'm a catch, but I have very low confidence and self esteem, and after being single for four years now, it only seems to get lower.

During this isolation, in which I live on my own with my three cats, my loneliness (is killing meeee, haha) and desperation for a relationship are only seeming to get worse. Has anyone else been in a situation like this, aside from the isolation?

I do really want to find love more than anything, but I'm starting to give up hope. I guess this is just a jumbled mess on my thoughts, I'm sorry. This is basically how I'm feeling right now.
