Having trouble installing Mimio Studio smartboard software I am trying to get Mimio Studio installed on my Ubuntu 16.04 machine. Mimio Studio is a hardware+software system that can be used with a projector to create a virtual whiteboard on just about any flat surface.When I installed Chrome, I used dpkg -i, apt-get update, install -f, which from what I understand, is supposed to take care of dependencies issues, so I tried something similar when I ran into trouble with Mimio, but no luck. Additionally, in my attempt to install Mimio, I enabled architecture i386.I am a huge noob, so I dont really know what kinds of details to give when asking my question, or what kinds of keywords to search for online.What do I need to tell you?
