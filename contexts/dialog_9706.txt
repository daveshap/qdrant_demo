PALM: I had to leave this place. I got depressed, seeing all the crap. And the thing is, they're making more crap, you know? They've got so many stores and stuff and junk full of crap, I can't believe it.
BOBBY: Who?
PALM: Who? People, that's who! Pretty soon there won't be room for anyone. They're selling more crap that people go and buy than you can imagine. Oofh! Crap! I believe everybody should have a big hole where they throw in all this stuff and burn it.
RAYETTE: There'd never be a hole big enough. Now took at me, for instance, when I was just one person, before Bobby, I had so much garbage collectin' onto me every day, I was thinkin' about gettin a dispose all...
PALM: A dispose-all, what's that but more crap? I've never seen such crap. Oofh, I don't know how people get up in the morning.
TERRY: Mass production is what does it.
PALM: What do you mean mass"... I have to come out and tell you
TERRY: Wait a minute. I'm not that neat, maybe, but I am clean.
PALM: Well, you're not that bad, but some people... I mean, people's homes, just filth. I've been in people's homes...
TERRY: In my personal observation, I think that more people are neat than are clean...
PALM: In my personal thing, I don't see that. I'm seeing more filth. A lot of filth. What they need to do every day, no, once in a while, is a cockroach thing, where they spray the homes. And uh... can you imagine, if their doors were painted a pretty color, and they had a pot outside, with...
TERRY: Yeah, it could be adorable...
PALM: And they picked up! I mean, it wouldn't be filthy, with Coke bottles and whiskey, and those signs everywhere...
