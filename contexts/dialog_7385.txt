MRS. BRUCE: Someday you'll have a son just like you, Jeremiah. A boy who lies through his teeth, buys demonic records, and smokes the dope just like you.
JAM: If I'm anything like you, I'll deserve him.
MRS. BRUCE: What?!
JAM: I said, I'm sorry!
MRS. BRUCE: If you truly are sorry, son, then you better pray like you've never prayed before. God willed me to find those tickets because He wanted to hear from you. He knows you need help and He wants you to ask Him for it.
