What are some jobs/careers that offer flexible schedule, potentially work from home (not necessarily), low stress, decent pay (maybe 60k - 80k), and that wouldn't take long to meet the requirements for as it relates to training and/or education?
Right now I work in the medical field. I went to a trade school for what I do and it only took me two years and less than 20k to start out making about 25-30 bucks/hour. I'm pretty much capped off at 30/hour with some exceptions but I'm happy with the lifestyle I life at that level, especially considering that the cost of living is fairly low where I live.

I really like my job. It is low stress, easy as hell, and the time spent in school to money (making) ratio is really good in my opinion. However, the problem is that hours are not consistent for me. My pay fluctuates with patient caseload and I never really know from week to week how much work I'll have. I'm interested in potentially pursuing other jobs/careers and am looking for something that is similar, but that would provide me with a more consistent and dependable income.

What are some options? I know that I said work from home in the title, but that's not a requirement by any means.
