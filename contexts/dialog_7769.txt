HARRY: Who's Principal Collins?
LLOYD: The principal.
HARRY: Wow.
MS. HELLER: Your assignment is to pick the class. Find some other students just as special as you.
LLOYD: Will that be on the midterm?
MS. HELLER: No.
LLOYD: You know, you're the first person I've brought here.
HARRY: Oh, is this your special place?
LLOYD: No, I just usually eat my lunch on the crapper. Saves time. Out with the old, in with the new.
HARRY: Can we eat there tomorrow?
LLOYD: Sure, but first we have to find kids special, needy and classy enough to be in Special Needs.
HARRY: It'll be like taking candy from a stranger.
LLOYD: H A R R Y...
HARRY: The second R is silent.
LLOYD: Oh, of course.
