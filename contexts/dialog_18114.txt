KITTRIDGE: This is Kittridge.
ETHAN: Go secure.
KITTRIDGE: Go ahead.
ETHAN: Theyíre dead.
KITTRIDGE: Whoís dead?
ETHAN: My team. Claire, Jack, even Jim - - Hannah, maybe, I -- donít know
KITTRIDGE: Are you damaged?
ETHAN: They knew we were coming. Golitsynís dead too. The disk is gone.
KITTRIDGE: <u>Are you intact</u>?
ETHAN: Do you read me? <u>The list is in the open</u>!
KITTRIDGE: Let's just bring you in safely, and then we'll worry about that, okay? Were you followed?
ETHAN: I donít think so.
KITTRIDGE: Donít <u>think</u>, be <u>sure</u>. Are you clean?
ETHAN: Yes.
KITTRIDGE: Location green. One hour. Iíll be there myself.
ETHAN: Youíre in Prague?
KITTRIDGE: Heard a lot about you, Hunt. Donít disappoint me.
ETHAN: No sir.
KITTRIDGE: One hour.
KITTRIDGE: I can't tell you how sorry I am. I know how much Jim in particular meant to you, Ethan. Personally as well as professionally.
ETHAN: Yeah.
KITTRIDGE: Passport, visas - you know the drill. We'll work the exfiltration thru Canada, debrief you at Langley. Throw the Prague police a bone, you know toss them a few suspects. Follow me?
ETHAN: Yeah. I follow you.
KITTRIDGE: We've lost enough agents for one night.
ETHAN: You mean <u>I've</u> lost enough agents for one night.
KITTRIDGE: You seem hell bent on blaming yourself, Ethan.
ETHAN: Who else is left?
KITTRIDGE: Yes. I see your point.
ETHAN: Why was there another team?
KITTRIDGE: What?
ETHAN: Of IMF agents. At the Embassy. Tonight.
KITTRIDGE: I don't quite follow you.
ETHAN: Let's see if you can follow me around this room. The drunk Russians on the embankment at 7 and 8 o'clock...The couple waltzing around me at the Embassy at 9 and 11. The waiter behind Hannah at the top of the staircase - Bowtie, 12 o'clock. The other IMF team. You're worried about me. <u>Why</u>?
KITTRIDGE: You're right. Maybe this'll save some time.
KITTRIDGE: For a little over two years now we've been spotting serious blowback in IMF operations. We have a penetration. The other day we decoded a message on the Internet from a Czech we know as Max.""
ETHAN: The arms dealer.
KITTRIDGE: That's right. Max, it seems, has two unique gifts -- a capacity for anonymity and for corrupting susceptible agents. This time he's gotten to someone on the inside - he's put himself in a position to buy our NOC list. An operation he referred to as Job 314". The job he thought Golitsyn was doing tonight."
ETHAN: But the list Golitsyn stole was a decoy.
KITTRIDGE: Correct the actual list is safe at Langley. Golitsyn" was a lightning rod
ETHAN: This whole operation was a molehunt.
KITTRIDGE: Yes, the mole's deep inside. And -- like you said. You survived.
