Trump Elected President - What Comes Next
In a stunning upset we've all heard about, [Trump was elected President last night.](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/09/us/politics/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-president.html?action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=span-abc-region&region=span-abc-region&WT.nav=span-abc-region)

We've been getting a post a minute asking "what comes next" so we've decided to make a mod post to consolidate them.

A few interesting starting resources:

* [September profile of Trump's transition plans.](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/09/26/president-trumps-first-term)

* [Foreign policy analysis of the incoming Trump administration.](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/09/world/donald-trumps-victory-promises-to-upend-the-international-order.html?action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=span-abc-region&region=span-abc-region&WT.nav=span-abc-region)
