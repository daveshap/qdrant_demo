Birthday gift too mature?
I just turned 18 and got this ring as a gift from a close relative and as much as I love it I’m not quite sure if it’s suitable for my age? I kind of feel it looks a tad bit too mature maybe or a bit too big. I’m also thinking it looks a bit gaudy for my age. Thoughts please? ( Inserted some pics in the link below ) I really love the design and it suits my style I’m just really having reservations about it. Lastly, considering my age I think others might think of it as fake partly due to it’s size when its not. Thanks! Will really appreciate any thoughts and comments!!
