GEORGE: Andy, c'mon IN! Thanks for flyin' out here!!
ANDY: The stewardess let me keep my headphones.
GEORGE: That's... terrific! But I got something better. This is BIG... You are getting a once-in-a- lifetime, unbelievably lucrative opportunity to star on... a PRIMETIME NETWORK SITCOM!!!!
ANDY: Sitcom...?
GEORGE: And this is a CLASS ACT! It's the guys who did the Mary Tyler Moore and Bob Newhart shows! It takes place in a taxi stand! And you're gonna be the Fonzie!
ANDY: I'm -- Fonzie? GEORGE NO! The Fonzie! The crazy breakout character! The guy that all the kids impersonate and put on their lunchboxes!
ANDY: George, I hate sitcoms.
GEORGE: HANG ON, you ain't heard the best part! ABC has seen your foreign man character, and they want to turn him into -- Latka
ANDY: No.
GEORGE: No"? "No" to which part??"
ANDY: No to the whole thing. None of it sounds good.
GEORGE: Andy... this is every comedian's dream.
ANDY: I told you, I'm not a comedian. And sitcoms are the lowest form of entertainment: Stupid jokes and canned laughter.
GEORGE: B-but, this is classy... they did Bob Newha--
ANDY: I'm not interested. I want to create my own material.
GEORGE: You have to do it.
ANDY: I refuse.
GEORGE: LISTEN, you arrogant putz! I've been in this business for twenty years! I know! If you walk away from this opportunity, you will never, NEVER see another one like it again!!!!
ANDY: Okay. Fine, I'll do it. But I have a few terms.
GEORGE: Of course! That's what negotiations are for.
