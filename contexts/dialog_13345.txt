LILA: Uh, tie them up, Rosie. If you will.
ROSE: With pleasure.
ROSE: I'm going to miss you.
LILA: Oh, Rosie.
ROSE: And I'm going to miss the lifestyle having you as a client has afforded me.
LILA: Shut up, you.
ROSE: I like you so much, with or without hair. But don't spread that around. Bad for business.
LILA: I'm really glad you two found each other.
