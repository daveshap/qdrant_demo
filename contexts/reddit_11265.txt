Just got back from the desert and...
I was recently deployed and estactic that I managed to get back to the states with time to take leave for Christmas so I could be home for the holidays this year. However on returning to my duty station I found that my car is having transmission issues. It's in the shop currently getting an ATF flush but if that doesn't work I'll have to rebuild the transmission. Between all the gifts I've already bought for my family and paying off all of my debt with my deployment money I don't have the money to fix my transmission and still go home. I'm used to not going home for holidays but this Christmas I was so sure I was going home and now I'm starting to have doubts that I will be able to. When I was in the desert I had this thought of surprising my dad at work when I got into town but now that just doesn't seem possible. I don't know what I'm gonna do if the ATF flush doesn't work.

Edit: Words.
