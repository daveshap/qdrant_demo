Just got into a reach school ðŸŽ‰
Edit: Gonna pull a classic reddit move and edit this. Thanks for the replies, never expected this to get attention. Iâ€™m a (male) senior and Marquette University was the Skool. Everyone varies in stats but this was my personal reach, so â€˜â€˜twas cool. Thanks again, good luck with college apps everyone!
