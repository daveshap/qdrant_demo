WOOLRIDGE: Are you sure you're okay staying with that woman and boy?
KARL: Yes sir.
WOOLRIDGE: Do they know about you?
KARL: My history.
WOOLRIDGE: Yeah.
KARL: I told 'em about it. They know I'm well. That Mizz Wheatley made me some biscuits.
WOOLRIDGE: I'll be.
KARL: That boy, he's my friend. He likes the way I talk and I like the way he talks.
WOOLRIDGE: I knew you'd do all right. Well, I just wanted to check on you. I'll say bye to Bill and get on back.
