BETTY: Lyla's very nice.
GEORGE: Yes, she is.
BETTY: She told me I was charming and relentless, and would go far in this town. And she said that unlike the other charming, relentless people she knew, she liked me.
GEORGE: She's a good person to know. So where did you study again?
BETTY: Carleton School of Nursing. Two semesters, but Del made me give it up...
GEORGE: Alright, okay... I think you broke the record for staying in character about three hours ago.
BETTY: You told me that two hours ago.
BETTY: I haven't been this happy since I was twelve years old.
GEORGE: What happened when you were twelve?
BETTY: For Mother's Day, I used all my allowance that I'd been saving to take my mother to Kansas City. We got our nails done and had lunch at Skies
GEORGE: Wow... You just gave me goosebumps, you know that? You make it all sound so real. Great improv...
BETTY: I just want everything to be perfect between us.
GEORGE: I know. Listen, we need to take a time out here. Can we talk seriously for a minute?
BETTY: Of course.
GEORGE: At last! I know how much you want this. You're gifted and extremely determined, but... it's not up to me.
BETTY: I know. It's up to us.
