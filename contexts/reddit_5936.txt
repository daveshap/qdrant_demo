People who switched to software dev from a different career, how did you manage the transition?
As title says. I'm fed up with law and I have great interest (and some knowledge) in programming. I wonder, as a 33 y/o man what would be the best path to manage the transition considering I have no savings to be jobless for what I reckon is at least one year of studying (even more if I wanted to enroll in CS, but I seriously doubt is a viable option for me, at least for now). 

I live in Europe and I'm fairly available to relocate if necessary.
