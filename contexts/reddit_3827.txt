Slept with a pair if twins separately not knowing it wasn't the same person
I hooked up with a girl from tinder. A year later  I see a girl who I think is her on tinder also. I couldn't have remembered the name if my life depended on it. I ask if she wants to come over after we matched, the conversation was was consensually direct being that it was 11:30 on a sunday. I didn't mention that I recognised her. At that point I wasn't really sure if it was her and she hadn't placed me so I thought I was just having deja Vu . She said yes and came over. After we hooked up I said "you look familiar",I  wanted to get it out in the air because at this point I felt like I was going mad with her not remembering me. "We've definitely hooked up before". Her face went a little white. You know I'm a twin, right? I said "no? ,  How am I supposed to know that?" . "Did you sleep with my sister" she asked. I then said "yea I guess so... Shit". The whole thing seemed a bit surreal . Her sister, from a year ago, was living at her dad's friends place near her school where she was located. It was the same area where I was working in the city . I asked if she lived with the extremely religious family who knew her dad. She said that it was definitely her sister. I played nice. Trying to make it not awkward. I felt stupid for making the mistake and in disbelief of the situation. I invited her to the living room to smoke some weed and I had some cookies on the table, we chatted for about 30 minutes but it was 12:30 on a Sunday with work only 7 hours away, I said I should be getting to bed. (I had made this point  prior to her coming over which she stated she understood and was fine with) . This is probably one of the weirder non kink things that has happened to me.
