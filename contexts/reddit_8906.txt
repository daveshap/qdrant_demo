What are the pros and cons of the BC and Ontario foreign buyers taxes?
[British Columbia](http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/taxes/property-taxes/property-transfer-tax/understand/additional-property-transfer-tax) and [Ontario](http://www.fin.gov.on.ca/en/bulletins/nrst/nrst.html) have both imposed (or are in the process of imposing) taxes on foreign entities purchasing residences in the Vancouver and Toronto metropolitan areas.  In each case, the tax is 15% of the value of the residence.

What have been the impacts of these policies so far on prices and transactions in Vancouver and Toronto?  Have they achieved their ends?  Have there been unintended consequences?
