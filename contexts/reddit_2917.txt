Leaving my job sector to pursue career as a Dermatologist. 25, anxious about making transition. Has anyone gone back to school after many years to find another skill they were passionate in studying?
Currently employed by the postal service and have been emotionally/physically drained by seeing a positive long term career working in a company that's being plagued with political and financial pressure on top of covid19 demand. I worked with the company right before transferring to college due to me needing medical insurance and a livable salary in the city. I been thinking a lot about my passions in life, living with lupas has brought so much knowledge on my condition. Skincare is the biggest part of my routine over the years that I have been seen as the "go-to" opinion within my social circle over skincare suggestions, bad scalps, STI scares, etc. I've always had an odd fascination with illnesses despite me having one and thought about working in the medical field before I became a mail lady. Don't want to sound naive, but if there was any branch of medicine to study I would say dermatologist because of my medical condition and how I can help others. I don't want to pursue my original major under accounting anymore but rather as a dermatologist (with a focus on cosmetic surgery), I was on the verge on transferring to uni from a community college. After poor attempts of balancing school and work, I picked work. Now I want to go back for school on something I care about. I would be responsible for all my tuition expenses. Every decision I make now is a long term investment. Living now I am aware of my values and what I admire in a work environment. There are moments where I get anxious if I am making the right choice right now during the pandemic. Any advice, tips or feedback would be appreciated. thank you.
