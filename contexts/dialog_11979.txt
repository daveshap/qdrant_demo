ELLIOT: Oh, book? Oh, no, I... I'm killing time. I...I-I just, uh, w-want to browse, uh...
LEE: Well, you sure picked the right place. I mean, you can stay here all afternoon, not buy anything and just read.
ELLIOT: Unless, of course, if-if you had some time, I mean, we could get some coffee.
LEE: No, I don't have time.
ELLIOT: No, no. I-I-I understand completely. No problem. Y-you're busy. I-I-I...
LEE: You seem tense. Is everything all right? You feel okay?
ELLIOT: No! No...
LEE: No?
ELLIOT: Uh, yes!
LEE: Yes?
ELLIOT: Yes.
LEE: Everything's okay?
ELLIOT: Yeah. How are you?
LEE: I'm...all right.
ELLIOT: How-how's Frederick?
LEE: Fine. Oh, we went to the Caravaggio exhibition at the Met. It's such a treat to go through a museum with Frederick. I mean...you learn so much. Do you like Caravaggio?
ELLIOT: Oh, yes. Who doesn't? Look!
ELLIOT: e.e. cummings. I'd like to get you this.
LEE: Oh, no, I can't let you get me that. That's too much.
ELLIOT: Oh, oh, yes. I-I-I-'d like to, uh, uh, very much.
LEE: No, I don't think so.
ELLIOT: I-I read a poem of you and thought of his last week. A poem of his and thought of you last-- You'll be fine, though. Lee walks over to Elliot in the center aisle. She looks at the book.
LEE: Uh, uh, this is great. I mean, I love e.e. cummings, but I can't let you get this.
ELLIOT: Yes, I'd...I-I-I'd love, I'd love to get you this.
LEE: Well, sure.
ELLIOT: And-and maybe, um...maybe we could discuss it sometime.
LEE: Well, thanks a lot.
ELLIOT: Thanks for showing me the bookstore. Perhaps you could, uh, take me to an AA meeting sometime. Uh...uh, I'd love to see what goes on.
LEE: Well, yeah, yeah. You'd love it. It's really entertaining. You'd have a good time. I know you would.
ELLIOT: And, uh, d-don't forget the poem on page a hundred and twelve. It reminded me of you.
