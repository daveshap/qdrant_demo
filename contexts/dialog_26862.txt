MEREDITH: Dickie, my God!
RIPLEY: Hello Meredith.
MEREDITH: I was looking at you, your clothes, I wouldn't have known you...
RIPLEY: Well, you've spotted me and so you get the reward.
MEREDITH: What?
RIPLEY: Just kidding. Are you alone?
MEREDITH: Hardly. I couldn't be less alone.
RIPLEY: Of course. Aunt Joan.
MEREDITH: And co. A lot of co. Oh, God, I've thought about you so much.
RIPLEY: I've thought about you.
MEREDITH: When I thought about you I was mostly hating you. Where've you been hiding?
RIPLEY: I haven't been hiding. I've been in Police custody. They've been trying to flush out Freddie's killer.
MEREDITH: You're kidding.
RIPLEY: They're letting me have this vacation. Which is why the get-up. Which is why you haven't heard from me.
MEREDITH: You know, the whole world thinks you killed Freddie? It's terrible.
RIPLEY: I know. Look, I can't talk now. Later. Later?
MEREDITH: So -- are you travelling under R?
RIPLEY: You know what -- I am.
MEREDITH: Dickie, are you with Peter Smith- Kingsley? I bet you are. My aunt thought she saw him.
RIPLEY: Peter Smith-Kingsley? I haven't seen him in months. No, I'm alone.
PETER: How was it?
RIPLEY: Good. But I think we should stay in here for the rest of the trip.
PETER: Was that Meredith?
RIPLEY: Was who Meredith?
PETER: Meredith Logue. You were kissing somebody. Looked like Meredith.
RIPLEY: Hardly kissing. Kissing off.
PETER: Didn't look that way -- you know -- from a distance.
RIPLEY: I lied. To her. She thought she'd seen you.
PETER: Why lie?
RIPLEY: Dickie and Peter, that's just too good gossip, isn't it?
PETER: Or Tom and Peter even.
RIPLEY: Well that would be even better gossip.
PETER: Really, why? Sorry, I'm completely lost.
RIPLEY: I know. I'm lost, too. I'm going to be stuck in the basement, aren't I, that's my, that's my -- terrible and alone and dark -- and I've lied about who I am, and where I am, and so nobody can ever find me.
PETER: What do you mean lied about who you are?
RIPLEY: I suppose I always thought -- better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody.
PETER: What are you talking about -- you're not a nobody! That's the last thing you are.
RIPLEY: Peter, I... I...
PETER: And don't forget. I have the key.
RIPLEY: You have the key. Tell me some good things about Tom Ripley. Don't get up. Just tell me some nice things.
PETER: Good things about Tom Ripley? Could take some time!... Tom is talented. Tom is tender... Tom is beautiful...
RIPLEY: You're such a liar...
PETER: ...Tom is a mystery...
