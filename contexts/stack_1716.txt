STLink 3.3V target power In order to program a target MCU with STLink you need to connect 4 wires - SWCLK, SWDIO, GND and VCC (3.3V). STLink v2 programmer has 3.3V pin already present and ready to use. But let's say I would like to use my STM32F401 Nucleo-64 development board as a programmer. In this case, I need to remove CN2 jumpers and use SWD connector. The problem is, SWD connector does not have target power (3.3V) pin. Where do I get 3.3V? Can I just take it from nucleo board?
