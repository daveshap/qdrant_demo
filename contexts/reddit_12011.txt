My boyfriend of one year just confessed that I am not sexually appealing to him.
I'm a 24 year old male and he's a 19 year old male. We've been together for a year now. 

December he cheated on me and admitted that I was not giving him the amount of sex he desires. In February I tested my testosterone and the levels were quite low. I went on clomid to help raise my levels of testosterone and it tripped it, however it didn't increase my sex drive. I am investigating this further. 

So we have been talking about a possible third to add to our relationship to help with his desires. This past Friday someone came over and I was not prepared for what happened next. 

We started drinking a little bit and my boyfriend started complementing him in ways I've never been complemented. It progressed to the point where all 3 of us were in my bed and my boyfriend started to give this guy a blow job, which I was completely ok with. Then I noticed that they wanted to move beyond that. That's the point where I couldn't take it and said that they should not go any further, just stop. 

They listened but I was still hurting, for one I was not getting any attention, and the second thing is that my boyfriend didn't understand why I stopped him. This other guy left shortly after I told them to stop. 

Once we were alone I asked him why does he want a third person so badly, and that's when he told me that I wasn't sexually attractive for him. I broke down crying. All my insecurities that I kept bottled up were confirmed by the one person who I truly love. 

He has assured me that it's just for sex and that I am everything he wants in a person, except for my body. And he truly loves me. 

I don't know what to do next...
