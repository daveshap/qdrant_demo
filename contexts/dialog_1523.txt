GASTON: Where's the ADM? Where did your uncle put it?
ANDY: Man, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
GASTON: Bullshit! Your uncle told you!
ANDY: My uncle's in a coma you moron!
GASTON: Before the coma!
ANDY: He didn't tell me anything. All he said was Saint Severin...
GASTON: Saint Severin? The church? So you know all about the ADM! Where is it! Tell me! Tell me or else!
ANDY: Or else what? You'll kill me?
GASTON: No. But I'll kill your fucking girlfriend!
ANDY: You'll never get the chance.
