How do you react when recruiters offer your a worse job than you applied for or submit you for a job you never signed up for?
I've had this happen more than once. I almost decided to say sure schedule me for an interview and purposely flake and never call them again. These are recruiters for companies and for staffing agencies doing this. They know no one wants these jobs and I don't like them trying to push them on me.
