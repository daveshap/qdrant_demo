NADIA: I'm sorry.
JOHN: I don't know why I said that. She's not dead at all.
NADIA: What?
JOHN: I don't know why I said it. I'm sorry.
NADIA: She's alive?
NADIA: She's alive!! She is not dead?
JOHN: Laugh it up.
JOHN: You should stop smoking. You're pregnant. You smoke like a fucking lab dog.
NADIA: I'm trying to quit.
JOHN: I've got news for you. It's not working.
NADIA: I smoke more these days. I smoke more when I'm unhappy.
JOHN: Nobody's that unhappy.
NADIA: Maybe I want to die. Don't you want me to die?
JOHN: I don't want anyone to die.
NADIA: Except for Small Eyes.
JOHN: Except for Small Eyes.
