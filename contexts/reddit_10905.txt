As of 1 hour ago, literally all my friends are dead.
All left me in 2016.

 My best friend was the first to go. She started doing heroin against my warnings. A week after her first time trying it, she got a batch laced with fentanyl and elephant tranquilizers. I remember the last text I got from her... 

Next was someone I reconnected with at her service. I hadn't seen him in years, so we started hanging out and stuff again. He never told me he had a pill problem.. he probably knew I would have stopped talking to him... he overdosed a month after we got close again.

Two days before that, my friend from high school was on his way to work when his power steering went out while he was getting off the freeway. His car flipped and his neck snapped on impact. 

This year has been emotional torment. I said I couldn't handle any more losses. Then an hour ago, I get a call from my friends mother telling me that he lost his battle with cancer... I can't do this anymore. I'm sick to my stomach. I'm all alone. I have literally no one to talk to... all the people I could find comfort in are gone... 

Maybe if there IS an afterlife I can see them again...
