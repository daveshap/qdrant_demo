ABBOTT: What?
PAMELA: They found Danny Zorn's body. Dead in the basement at the building where my people got hit the first time.
ABBOTT: Oh, God... It must have been Bourne.
PAMELA: Did he say anything to you?
ABBOTT: No... It must have been Bourne.
PAMELA: We'll know for sure when we get the security tapes.
CRONIN: But we can relax. We tracked him. He's on a train to Moscow.
ABBOTT: Moscow? What the Hell's he going to Moscow for?
PAMELA: Don't know.
ABBOTT: Jesus... I, Zorn... I have to call his family. Tell them...
PAMELA: I'm sorry, Ward.
