What are the legal procedures of impeaching an American president?
So I'm from the UK and I've heard the term "impeachment" a lot recently.


 I've just seen a video on facebook regarding [this senator](http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2017/08/17/steve-cohen-impeach-president-trump-charlottesville/575764001/) beginning the impeachment process. However, after googling and trying to look into it, it does not appear to have been the first time as it has come up in[ June 2017](http://www.independent.co.uk/News/world/americas/us-politics/trump-impeachment-removal-democrats-begin-proceedings-al-green-a7778301.html) as well.

So I was curious how it all worked really, what time frame? What triggers?

Does the president continue to serve as president until the end, or are they suspended until the process is concluded (succesfully or not)?

Is there a limit to how many times it can be suggested?
