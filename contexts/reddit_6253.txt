I put my uncles' company on my resumé and my new job wants a W2 or paystub from it.
So over the years I've occasionally done some work for my uncles' company (maybe 3-4 hours a month average) and they pay me cash when I go see them or take me out to dinner or buy me that thing I've been wanting, etc. So I put it on my resumé as something like "May 2011-Present". Now, my new company that I'm supposed to start at on Monday wants to know why I forgot to put it on my background check form and wants either a W2 or paystubs.

What do I do? Can I just say "Hey, it's my uncles' company and don't do a lot for them and they just pay me cash"? Is that a bad idea? My uncle said he'd be willing to make me a paystub, but that seems kinda illegal. I'm in US-NY (as is the new company) and they're in US-FL if that's important.
