Graduate Course Prereqs
I'm an incoming PhD student for fall semester and I'm both confused and more than a little stressed out having looked at the graduate course catalog at my new university.  Out of curiosity, I looked at some of the courses that I'm supposed to be taking in my first year and I don't meet the prerequisites to take them.  It's not that I don't meet the prereqs for the program--I have a full BS in the subject, it's just that I went to a tiny college that didn't even offer the courses in question.  

What happens in a case like this?  Would they even let me take these classes?  This is making my imposter syndrome vibes go through the roof because I feel like when they try to register me for them, I'm terrified that they're going to find out that I'm not good enough to even be there.
