LLOYD: My girlfriend's predicting another murder in the next few days.
PETER: What makes her think that?
LLOYD: She says she's on the rag every time I get called in to investigate a murder.
PETER: So... they're on some cycle. The murders... Gregory... then 28 days later... Carlton.
LLOYD: And that was 28 days ago today.
PETER: Did we get those DNA tests back?
LLOYD: Just this morning. Animal hairs were found all over the victims.
PETER: What kind of animal?
LLOYD: Can't figure out the species. Similar to a wolf. They're jokin' at the lab that a werewolf probably killed him. Ain't that the stupidest thing you ever heard?
FRIDA: Go away. I might hurt you.
PETER: I'm not afraid. Frida! I love you.
FRIDA: Peter I love you too but...
PETER: I don't think you'll hurt me.
FRIDA: How do you know?
PETER: I don't think you would. No matter what form you take.
FRIDA: I can't take that chance... I couldn't live with myself if I did anything to you.
PETER: I have the silver bullets in case I need to protect myself. Does that make you feel better?
