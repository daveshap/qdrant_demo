Can undergraduate resident assistants be made to clean up bodily fluid as part of their expectations?
I am a (graduate assistant) Hall Director at a small semi-rural university. The university does not have extensive resources when it comes to handling situations after hours. Part of the expectations of the on-duty resident assistants is that they will clean up bodily fluid "spills" if found after hours, or over the course of the weekend. They are given small kits with absorbent powders, expected to scrape all of the mess into a bio hazard bag, and then leave the bag in the hall office until the next morning or Monday. 

Resident Assistants at this particular university have never received any specialized training for this type of endeavor and it is usually a "learn as you go" experience for them. While I'm sure you are all aware of the broader context of why I am posing this question, I would like to keep responses general as to whether it is even legal to require undergraduate staff to clean up bodily fluids, inclusive of blood, vomit, and urine as part of their expectations. 

Edit: Are there any other subreddits I could xpost this question to? 

Update: According to the individual at OSHA that I spoke with over the phone today: if the bodily fluid does not contain blood then it doesn't fall under the regulations associated with medical waste and "blood born pathogens". As such, there is no specifically mandated training required, but the institution should have "some form" of training where the staff members who are expected to clean up vomit and other fluids are shown proper procedures and informed of communicable diseases.
