How to get a street map from location point and distance I would like to find a way to get the map giving a location point (center point) and a distance.For example, I would like to get the image map of a place with a squared area of N, S, E, W each 525 m from location point 51.05660 N, 3.721500 E.I would like to download, if possible, the image generated of this zone in png, eps or shapefile.
