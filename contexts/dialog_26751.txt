SUE: It is on.
TRENT: ...it is so on.
LORRAINE: Well... This is it.
MIKE: Listen. I had a great time.
LORRAINE: Me too.
MIKE: I would love to see you again sometime.
LORRAINE: I'll be around.
MIKE: That's not good enough. I want to make plans to see you.
LORRAINE: Let me get a pen out of my car. Do you have something to write on?
LORRAINE: You're a comedian?
MIKE: Yeah. And an actor.
LORRAINE: I'll have to come see you sometime.
MIKE: If and when I get a real gig I'll call you.
LORRAINE: It's not going to well?
MIKE: When I lived in New York they made it sound like they were giving out sit-coms to stand-ups at the airport. I got off the plane in L.A. six months ago and all I got to show for it is a tan.
LORRAINE: Didn't you tell me to be patient with my career?
MIKE: ...Yeah, but entertainment law isn't something you just jump into...
LORRAINE: Neither is acting. Not if you're serious about it. Can I have one of these?
MIKE: Why, you like the duck with the cigar?
LORRAINE: Yeah. Nice touch. It's the logo from You Bet Your Life"
MIKE: Good eye. Not one club owner got it. They all ask me why I got Donald Duck on my card.
LORRAINE: Hey, at least it's not Goofy.
LORRAINE: Well, I should be getting...
MIKE: ...It's really getting late.
LORRAINE: ...home. It's getting late. Yeah.
LORRAINE: Can I give you a ride to your car...?
MIKE: ...Nah. I'm right across the street...
LORRAINE: ...Which one...?
MIKE: ...The red piece of shit over there...
LORRAINE: ...well, it suits you...
MIKE: ...get the hell outta here already...
