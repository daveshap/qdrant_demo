Sen. Elizabeth Warren has announced an income based student loan debt relief policy. What are the pros and cons of this proposed policy?
Massachusetts senator and 2020 presidential candidate, Elizabeth Warren, announced a policy proposal that would forgive the student loan debt of approximately [95% of the 45 million Americans with student loan debt](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/22/politics/elizabeth-warren-student-debt-college-tuition-plan/index.html). Her policy is income based with families making more per year receiving less relief.

>Warren's plan would offer debt relief based on income. Households that make less than $100,000 a year would get $50,000 in loan cancellation, with the amount of relief getting gradually smaller as income level goes up, with households that make more than $250,000 not eligible for any debt relief.

This relief would apply to both federal and private loans, providing [loan cancellation or some type of relief for approximately 75% of Americans with outstanding loans debt](https://elizabethwarren.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Experts-Letter-to-Senator-Warren-.pdf). Her policy would also see an investment of an additional $100 billion over the next 10 years to Pell Grants, making them more available to students. If enacted, her policy would make [tuition and fees for all public higher education programs free to all Americans](https://medium.com/@teamwarren/im-calling-for-something-truly-transformational-universal-free-public-college-and-cancellation-of-a246cd0f910f?subsource=GS-65766185245-elizabeth%20warren-p-335466676005&gclid=CjwKCAjwzPXlBRAjEiwAj_XTEZm3EblAFgQHv2JYwl2qvLeEjE8QTKGEF7uwHrC77sWngi2CwQONLBoCPwUQAvD_BwE&refcode=WFP2019-LB-GS-NC&refcode2=GS-65766185245-elizabeth%20warren-p-335466676005).

Sen. Warren's campaign estimates this policy to cost about $1.25 trillion over 10 years. She proposes a wealth tax, which she calls the "Ultra-Millionaire Tax," which would be a 2% per year tax on families whose wealth exceeds $50 million. According to her website she estimates about 75,000 families would be affected by this "Ultra-Millionaire Tax."

What are the pros and cons of such a policy? Is there an economic advantage to the forgiveness of such a large amount of student loan debt?
