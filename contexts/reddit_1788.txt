Woke up this morning, checked my portal, and you wonâ€™t believe what was there
Nothing. My Ohio State portal said nothing, but my Penn State portal:






SAID I GOT ACCEPTED TO PENN STATE AHHHHHHH!!!!!!






Edit: Thank you to everyone saying congrats and the like. I really appreciate it A2C gang!


Edit #2: In the comments I said I was an Agribusiness major, but I contacted admissions and got my application re-reviewed to join the Smeal College of Business as a Management Information Systems major.
