BARTON: ...It's a tenement building. On the Lower East Side...
LIPNIK: Great! He's poor, this wrestler! He's had to struggle!
BARTON: And then... well...
BARTON: ...Can I be honest, Mr. Lipnik?
LIPNIK: CAN you? You damn well better be. Jesus, if I hadn't been honest in my business dealings – well, of course, you can't always be honest, not with the sharks swimming around this town – but if you're a writer, you don't think about those things – if I'd been totally honest, I wouldn't be within a mile of this pool – unless I was cleaning it. But that's no reason for you not to be. Honest, I mean. Not cleaning the pool.
