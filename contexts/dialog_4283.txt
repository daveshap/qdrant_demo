JOANNE: Who told you that?
DULANEY: He video taped you.
JOANNE: That bastard!
DULANEY: I thought he was a kind, gentle man?
JOANNE: Yes, I slept with him but that was a long time ago.
DULANEY: You're lying. Marsh was wearing a cast on the tape. It was right before he went to Chicago and met Miss Lawson. He dumped you for her, didn't he?
JOANNE: Yes.
DULANEY: It must have been horrible. Having to go there -- seeing them together - - knowing he was sleeping with her in the same bed he did with you.
JOANNE: I was jealous. Of course I was hurt. He switched me off like a little toy he was finished playing with. But I didn't kill him.
JOANNE: I'm a practical woman Mr. Dulaney. Killing Andrew wasn't in my best interest. As it is I'm out of a job and I'm not in his will.
DULANEY: Money isn't the only reason people commit murder, Miss Braslow.
