SA masters program and OPE questions
Hi Student Affairs! Long-time lurker here.
I'm currently looking at applying for a SA program starting next fall in either counseling with an emphasis in student affairs or higher ed administration. Essentially, just something that will help me get a GAship position, work as a Hall Director after, and eventually transition to recruiting or admissions after that wears of me for a while.

I had questions regarding OPE/TPE/SPE etc.:
First off, everyone I talked to (other RAs, HDs, Res Life admin) told me about OPE, but never mentioned any of the other ones, even though looking at online articles and sources, it seems like TPE has a bigger presence or turnout. Not sure if this is the case, but I was planning on attending OPE this spring as well as apply to some other schools that might not be there, should I plan to sign up for TPE or attend that exchange as well?

Secondly, I was a biology undergrad, honors college member, and graduated with honors, while working as RA for 1.5 years. I know major isn't a big deal for a SA program, but would I be considered a competitive candidate? (I also know a lot of that comes down to technical stuff like resumes, cover letters, interviews, etc.) but don't want to apply to really competitive programs if I'll be put towards the bottom of the pile right off the bat.

Last thing I'd have would be if anyone has suggestions for schools/programs to look into, I'd love to hear them. I've picked up quite a list of smaller schools to look at browsing old threads on this sub, but would always welcome more!
