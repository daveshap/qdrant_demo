Wavelength and penetration by EM radiation I'd like you to clarify the relationship which relates penetration power by EM radiation with its wavelength (or inverse of frequency).Suppose we conduct an experiment, irradiating a body with different wavelengths but keeping the amount of power per surface unit constant (so I reckon we have to reduce the power by the emitter as we shorten the wavelength, correct me if I'm wrong). Please appreciate that the body is always the same, so we can leave out the material's characteristics.  We should observe that as we move to higher frequencies, the radiation penetrates less and less into the body (again, tell me if I'm wrong).First question: why EM radiation is less penetrating at higher frequencies?However, one knows that the most penetrating form of EM are the gamma rays (that is, the radiation with the shortest wavelength), which seems to be in contrast with the above observation.So I gather that gamma rays are highly penetrative just because of the high energy they carry by the vitue of their high frequency. If we could manage to keep constant the net amount of electromagnetic power per surface unit, gamma rays would be LESS penetrating than, say, visible light.Am I correct?
