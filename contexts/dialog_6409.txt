ELLIE: ... I'm just so sick of feeling defensive about the things I care about! Or being lumped in with the lunatic fringe by people like Drumlin, when if they'd just put aside their preconceptions for two seconds and look at the facts...
PETER: They can't. I think it's against human nature to admit to that level of... insignificance; to not see yourself as basically the center of the universe.
ELLIE: It's like the pre-Copernicans who swore the sun revolved around the Earth, or the Victorians at the end of the last century who concluded that all major discoveries had now been made. I mean... try to imagine civilization a thousand years ahead of us -- then imagine trying to explain... I dunno, a microwave oven -- to someone even a hundred years ago -- I mean the basic concepts didn't exist...
PETER: 'Any sufficiently advanced technology...'
ELLIE: '... is indistinguishable from magic.'
