SILBERMAN: And who was the enemy?
REESE: SKYNET. A computer defense system built for SAC-NORAD by Cyber Dynamics. A modified Series 4800.
SILBERMAN: I see. And this...computer, thinks it can win by killing the mother of its enemy, kill- ing him, in effect, before he is even conceived? A sort of retroactive abortion?
REESE: Yes.
TRAXLER: That Silberman just crack me up. He had this guy in here last week who set his Afghan on fire. Screwed it first, then set it on--
VUKOVICH: Shut up.
REESE: ...it had no choice. The defensive grid was smashed. We'd taken the mainframes... We'd won. Taking out Connor then would make no difference. Skynet had to wipe out his entire exist- ence. We captured the lab complex. Found the...what- ever it was called...the time-displacement equipment. The Terminator had already gone through. They sent two of us to intercept, then zeroed the whole place. Sumner didn't make it.
SILBERMAN: Then how are you supposed to get back?
REESE: Can't. Nobody goes home. Nobody else comes through. It's just him and me.
