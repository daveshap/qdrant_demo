What are the pros and cons of running the Executive Branch like a corporation?
Given this latest [Executive Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/03/13/presidential-executive-order-comprehensive-plan-reorganizing-executive), 

> This order is intended to improve the efficiency, effectiveness, and accountability of the executive branch by directing the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (Director) to propose a plan to reorganize governmental functions and eliminate unnecessary agencies (as defined in section 551(1) of title 5, United States Code), components of agencies, and agency programs.

it seems clear that President Trump is trying to apply learned business practices to the governance of the United States (or at least the running of the Executive Branch), specifically the "cut the fat" reorganization strategy that corporations typically go through when merged or acquired by a new company.

> Downsizing in a company is defined to involve the reduction of employees in a workforce. Downsizing in companies became a popular practice in the 1980s and early 1990s as it was seen as a way to deliver better shareholder value as it helps to reduce the costs of employers (downsizing, 2015). Indeed, recent research on downsizing in the U.S.,[6] UK,[7] and Japan[8][9] suggests that downsizing is being regarded by management as one of the preferred routes to help declining organizations, cutting unnecessary costs, and improve organizational performance.

Has this ever been attempted before by removing entire federal agencies?  I'm sure it has been theorized by political philosophers and economists alike, but has anyone at the federal level ever put it into practice?
