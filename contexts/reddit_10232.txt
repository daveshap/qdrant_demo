My dad recorded a video of me walking down the street
He showed it to me on his pc, showing my hands in my pockets, my head down, obviously looking quite dead-faced. Telling me he showed this to me to show what u look like to the rest of the world, an overweight loser who will never get anothet girlfriend stuck in his own thoughts. I feel so weird and dirty that. I was recorded the one time I wasn't putting on a front, pretending I had my shit together head held up high. Maybe it's his fucked up way of trying to motivate me to sort my shit out but it just makes me wish I could stop existing. I fucking hate myself more. My family obviously hates me, maybe if I go they will feel sad for a bit but then as time goes on they'll forget about me. I know a spot off the local trail, maybe tonight, I'm not yet sure ðŸ˜” I want this pain in my head to go away. I'm sick of feeling stuck
