DEAN: What are you dialing?
BRILL: AmeriTech's data-base. There's Albert's D.C. office address and his phone's identity code. Now we just reprogram out phone with his ID code and you know what we've got?
SENATOR ALBERT: --Don't think it could've gone any better. Tell me, how's Deb? How're my grandchildren?
BRILL: A receiver tuned permanently to the Senator's phone.
