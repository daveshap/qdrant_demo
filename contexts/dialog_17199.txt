MARTY: I looked for you, Angie, before I cut out, but I couldn't find you.
ANGIE: I been looking all over for you!
MARTY: What happened, Angie, was that we thought we were just gonna go for a short walk, and then we thought we were gonna come right back, but we got to talking. Listen, Angie, I want you to meet Clara... Clara, this is my best friend, Angie. I told you about him.
CLARA: How do you do?
ANGIE: Waddaya gonna do now?
MARTY: I'm gonna take Clara home. It's close to one.
ANGIE: You want me to ride down with you?
MARTY: What for?
ANGIE: It's early.
MARTY: It must be one o'clock.
ANGIE: It's Saturday night! There's still plenty-a action around!
MARTY: Angie, by the time I get Clara home, it's gonna be one, one-thirty. By the time I get home, it's gonna be two o'clock. I gotta get up for ten o'clock mass tomorrow.
ANGIE: All right, I'll see you!
MARTY: Where you going?
