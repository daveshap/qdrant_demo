Took a huge step. Went to see a therapist today. Had a panic attack while leaving went there crying and all. But I did go.

Feeling completely drained now. Am cocooning in my room now.

Wow I love this response and all the encouragement and love. Thank you all. I am trying to respond to every comment. But it gets overwelhming. It will take time but I am reading every comment.
