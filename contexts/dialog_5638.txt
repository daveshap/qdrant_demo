REGGIE: I think Tex did it.
DYLE: Why?
REGGIE: Because I really suspect Gideon -- and it is always the person you don't suspect.
DYLE: Do women think it's feminine to be so illogical -- or can't they help it?
REGGIE: What's so illogical about that?
DYLE: A) It's always the person you don't suspect; B) that means you think it's Tex because you really suspect Gideon; therefore C) if you think it's Tex, it has to be someone else -- Gideon.
REGGIE: Oh. I guess they just can't help it.
DYLE: Who?
REGGIE: Women. You know, I can't help feeling rather sorry for Scobie. Wouldn't it be nice if we were like that?
DYLE: What -- like Scobie?
REGGIE: No -- Gene Kelly. Remember the way he danced down there next to the river in 'American in Paris' -- without a care in the world? This is good, want some?
DYLE: I'd love some, thanks.
REGGIE: I'm sorry.
DYLE: No sense messing up the streets.
REGGIE: Alex --
DYLE: Hm?
REGGIE: I'm scared.
DYLE: Don't worry, I'm not going to hit you.
REGGIE: No, about Scobie, I mean. I can't think of any reason why he was killed.
DYLE: Maybe somebody felt that four shares were too many --
REGGIE: What makes you think that this somebody will be satisfied with three? He wants it all, Alex -- that means we're in his way, too.
DYLE: Yes, I know.
REGGIE: First your brother, then Charles, now Scobie -- we've got to do something! Any minute now we could be assassinated! Would you do anything like that?
DYLE: What? Assassinate somebody?
REGGIE: No --
