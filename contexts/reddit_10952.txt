I don't understand why suicide is unacceptable
Why don't I have the right to end my own life? I can't talk about suicide to anyone in real life because the second I bring it up people tell me it's not the way and make me feel like I'm not allowed to even think about it. I never chose to be born and apparently I also can't choose to end my life. Why am I being forced to live when I don't want to? I really don't understand. I really wish suicide was acceptable and people with depression can apply to be euthanized.
