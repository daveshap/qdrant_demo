CHRIS: My God! What happened?
DOUG: I fell in love.
CHRIS: And a tram hit you?
DOUG: No, the boyfriend.
CHRIS: What happened to Katka?
DOUG: Didn't I tell you, she dumped me Monday night.
CHRIS: You Romeo's sure pay a high price sometimes - anyone I know?
DOUG: Holly!
CHRIS: Couldn't keep your hands off the hired help, huh?
DOUG: It just happened.
CHRIS: She's as American as apple pie too. Have you figured out exactly what it is you despise about them?
DOUG: She's cool.
CHRIS: A fine specimen for conversion.
DOUG: What are you on about?
CHRIS: Well, I take it you're going to drag her down to your minimal existence and adjust her mindset.
CHRIS: Don't tell me you really are in love?
DOUG: Yeah and I got the bruises to prove it. So what?
CHRIS: Nothing, it's just that's when things usually start to go wrong.
