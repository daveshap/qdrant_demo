RUBY: You're leaving, aren't you?
PICARD: I have to...
RUBY: Where? And don't tell me San Francisco...
PICARD: No. It's a lot further than that.
RUBY: It's the future, isn't it? Just like you told Scrimm. I knew you weren't from around here.
PICARD: No... I'm from France.
RUBY: I don't care if you're from France or Venus... just take me with you.
PICARD: That's impossible.
RUBY: Why?
PICARD: This may be hard for you to understand... but I'm duty-bound not to interfere with you, or anyone else here... any more than is absolutely necessary.
RUBY: You've been interfering with my life ever since I met you. Don't stop now.
