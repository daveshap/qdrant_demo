MOISHE: Think nothing of it, Spanky.
CONSTANCE: Spunky. He told you about that?
MOISHE: All he could think about was getting to you. There's still love there I think.
CONSTANCE: Love was never our problem.

STEVE: I shouldn't have left her.
JIMMY: Don't worry, big guy. I'm sure she got out of here before it happened.
