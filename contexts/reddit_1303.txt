Does anyone else get anxious when plans are made or changed at the last minute?
I'm a planner. I like to have a schedule and stick to it. I'm not sure if I'm the only one, but I get really anxious when the plans change at the last minute. All of these thoughts in my head: "when will we eat? When will I be able to get ready for work? When will I be able to get some rest? Will I be a terrible person if I turn someone down? I have to go because otherwise I'm not a good friend." ...and so much more. I wish I could be more flexible. I even have an anti-anxiety backpack with snacks, water, and the essentials and it doesn't help much. Sigh, anxiety.
