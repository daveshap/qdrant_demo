DON CORLEONE: It is Johnny. He came all the way from California to be at the wedding.
HAGEN: Should I bring him in.
DON CORLEONE: No. Let the people enjoy him. You see? He is a good godson.
HAGEN: It's been two years. He's probably in trouble again.
KAY: I didn't know your family knew Johnny Fontane.
MICHAEL: Sure.
KAY: I used to come down to New York whenever he sang at the Capitol and scream my head off.
MICHAEL: He's my father's godson; he owes him his whole career.
