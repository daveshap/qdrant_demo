Messed up big time with a useless degree, can someone help me career wise?
So back in 2017 I graduated with a 3.6 gpa at a 4 year university on the pre med track. Long story short, medicine isn't for me anymore and I won't be pursuing it. Currently I work as a lab tech at Inova hospital (hybrid job of lab bench work and information systems), and have been exploring career options as I have been working for 6 months.
Throughout thinking and exploring, I became very interested in IT and cybersecurity so I am thinking about getting certs to get a job. I have been applying to tech companies but have not gotten a job or interviews mainly due to the nature of my major and experience.
I'll be honest, money is a big factor in all of this as I have 90k in student loans. I feel as if i cannot obtain a high paying job (currently $22/hr) with this major, unless I obtain a Ph.D or higher education, which I am not trying to do with all this debt. Are there opportunities for me to have a successful and lucrative career as I am now, or should I switch to IT/cybersecurity as i can see myself being more passionate about it. I love working with computers and am curious about coding languages and such. My parents despise me right now because i'm not becoming a doctor, but I just couldn't go down that road of perpetual unhappiness, so cutting my losses here. Thank you.
