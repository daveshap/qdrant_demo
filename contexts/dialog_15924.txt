1ST DEMON: Why so few?
BARON: Faith.
2ND DEMON: What?
BARON: Delusion... a kind of magic which works against the magician.
1ST DEMON: Fool's magic.
BARON: Precisely. Faith has persuaded them a pygmie with a sling can kill an armed giant.
2ND DEMON: Dumb magic. Giant smash peewee.
BARON: Always.
2ND DEMON: We go out, smash 'em now?
BARON: No. Smashing is not required. I have a surprise for our tiny invaders... Raise that hatch!
