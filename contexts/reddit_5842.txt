Can I do anything with an interdisciplinary associates degree in the "Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences?
Anyone have any experience with similar interdisp degrees? I'm a Junior in High School and I'm going to be getting this degree in the fall as long as everything goes well. 

I'm basically just doing it as a stepping stone to a bachelors in whatever I decide to major in since I'm already finishing my general education anyway; I feel like this is a shitty mindset but I can't think of anything I can do with this degree -

Thoughts?
