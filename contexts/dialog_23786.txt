PHYLLIS: And what was that other one you did, the one where you're the jogger?
JACK: Oh, that was for, uh, wait... That was for Spray and Wash.
PHYLLIS: Spray and Wash. That's the one.
JACK: Yeah, I remember the girl who was in it with me. She was something.
PHYLLIS: I just remember you jogging. So when's the wedding?
MILES: This Saturday, Mom, remember? We told you.
JACK: And Miles is my best man, Mrs. Raymond. My main man.
PHYLLIS: Miles, when are you going to get married again?
MILES: I just got divorced. Phyllis.
JACK: Two years ago, buddy.
PHYLLIS: You should get back together with Victoria. She was good for you.
PHYLLIS: She was good for you. And so beautiful and intelligent. You knew her, right?
JACK: Oh, yeah. Real well. Still do.
PHYLLIS: I'm worried about you, Miles. Do you need some money?
