Corrupted Installation of Discord on Ubuntu 16.04 I have installed Discord on my Ubuntu 16.04 and I run it via terminal:<blockquote>  discord</blockquote>And it's working fine, but on the top of the screen it says my installation is corrupted and I should fix it. There's also a \"Help!\" button which upon click, just opens a new empty web browser window. Anyone know how I can fix my installation? I have tried reinstalling it and it's still the same.
