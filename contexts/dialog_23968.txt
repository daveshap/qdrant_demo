VIKTOR: -- Nicola! How was your massage?
NICOLA: You're in breach.
VIKTOR: -- Is this about the new pages? -- I made the changes you wanted, you're in virtually every scene --
NICOLA: It's not the size of the role, Viktor. Am I or am I not contractually entitled to the biggest trailer on the set?
VIKTOR: It's the biggest on earth! I swear! It's a 50-foot Airstream -- they don't make them any longer than that.
NICOLA: Taller, Viktor.
VIKTOR: Taller? What?
