JEHUDA: I thought you'd be off on tour, playing London, Paris, New York?
SZPILMAN: Not this week.
JEHUDA: I have to say you look terrible. What's the trouble?
SZPILMAN: You've heard the rumours they're going to resettle us in the East?
JEHUDA: Rumours, rumours, you take it all too much to heart, Wladek.
SZPILMAN: I've been trying to get a certificate of employment for my father. I've managed to get certificates for me and the rest of the family but I need one more for my father. I've been trying all the firms, the shops...
JEHUDA: Why didn't you come to me?
SZPILMAN: I didn't know you were in the certificate business.
JEHUDA: I'm not, but Majorek is.
SZPILMAN: Can you help? I've no money...
JEHUDA: Please, don't insult us. Can you do something for him?
