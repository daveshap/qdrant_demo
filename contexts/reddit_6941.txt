Did I just get fired or laid off?
At the end of my shift I was the last person to leave the store. I noticed that my boss had privately talked to everyone at the store throughout the day but that I was never talked to. I joined a store that just opened on the 3rd. As I was leaving my boss comes up to me and asks to talk. I did not think anything of it even though there were days I was asked to leave early and told not come in on other days. I was not expecting what he was about to tell me. He said that his labor was too high and that there just wasnt enough sales. He looked exhausted. He told me not to come in anymore because he has too many people. He shook my hand about four times and said that he liked me. When I got hired, they specifically told me that they needed people for night time front of the house. This came a day after he posted everyone's schedule. After I had been coming in everyday on their time without having anything to go off of. Im wondering If this would be considered being laid off? Can I tell people that I work for this company still?
