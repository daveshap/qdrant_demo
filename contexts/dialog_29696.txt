HELEN: I need you to talk to Dana. The vice principle called and she cut class again this afternoon.
HARRY: I'll handle it.
HARRY: Dana, Mr. Hardy called. Why weren't you in class today?
DANA: He lies! I was there! I was in the nurse's office, cause I had a headache.
HARRY: You seem fine now.
DANA: Great! You're going to believe that fat dweeb Mr. Hardy over your own daughter.
HARRY: I'm not sure what to believe anymore, young lady. You never used to lie to me. But lately you don't seem to know the difference between right and wrong.
HARRY: Dana, are you listening to me?
DANA: Yeah, Dad.
HARRY: You know you can always talk to me. Right? Whatever is going on in your life, your mom and I'll understand.
DANA: Okay, Dad.
HARRY: You'd tell me if there was something wrong, wouldn't you, pumpkin?
DANA: I'm not a pumpkin! Okay?!! Do I look even remotely like a pumpkin?! I'm not a muffin, or a cupcake or a honeybear either! And you don't understand anything Dad...
