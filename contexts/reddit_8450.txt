What are the Implications of the Queen's Suspension of Parliament?
As someone from the US, I'm curious to learn more about what it means to have the Queen suspend Parliament (https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-49493632). Some more specific questions include:

Who will be in charge of the government and its decisions while Parliament is suspended? Are these powers given to an individual, to a committee, or anything more broad?

How long does the suspension of Parliament last?

Has this ever happened before to set a precedent that we could expect to be followed?

How could this most likely affect the outcome of Brexit with regards to creating a deal or having a no-deal Brexit? (I imagine this is closely related to the first question of who will be in charge now)

What are the constitutional concerns relating to the Queen's suspension of Parliament?
