What career could be interesting for me?
(I'm sorry for any grammar mistakes, English is not my native language. Point them out anyway so I don't make then in future writings)

So I'm basically just before entering university and have no clue what I want to do...

I asked myself sometimes what I want to do for a living and well, the answer is always the same, nothing. 

I considered various careers; law, veterinary, economics, translation... But I just can't imagine doing any. All of them sound interesting but I just quickly lose interest in things. That's the reason for my regular grades too. I often find something we learn at school interesting, but after half an hour or less I lose interest, that line crossed, I start procrastinating and just can't focus.

Anyway, despite those impediments, there are some things I do like. I have a flair for language (not sure if I used the right idiom, I just learn languages pretty fast). I currently speak 3 languages fluently (English, Spanish, and German.) I understand some French but dropped it (May continue later) and I'd like to pick up 2 new ones (2 out of Japanese, Chinese, and Russian). I am furthermore studying a bit of Greek and Latin (In order to improve my general culture besides having a genuine interest in those cultures). Other than languages I am a bit curious about economics and entrepreneurship.

So I used to procrastinate the urge of finding a job I want to do for a living with the thought that I'd have no problem finding a job being polylingual, that thought got enhanced by some people in my environment. But as there are only 2 months left to decide what career to start I pushed myself to research a bit and write this post. 

Now straight to the point, does someone know a job I could like? or am I a hopeless case and should straight-up work on my mentality?

(if something remains unclear, just ask, I'd be glad to answer.)
