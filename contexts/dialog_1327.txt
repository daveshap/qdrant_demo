MRS. DICKSON: But I'm giving a party for him - a real, old-fashioned surprise party. Caps, bells, whistles, and everything. I'm really terribly excited about it. I've been planning it for months.
CLUETT: Well—
MRS. DICKSON: Well, what?
CLUETT: Well, aren't you going to invite me?
MRS. DICKSON: You? No can do. It's all set. Just a few of Tom's closest friends.
CLUETT: Now Phyllis, if you don't invite me, I'm coming anyway.
MRS. DICKSON: Don't be silly, Cyril. These are respectable people. They'd probably bore you to death.
CLUETT: No, they won't. Not when you are there. Oh, please, be a sport. Please ask me.
MRS. DICKSON: Why are you so anxious?
CLUETT: Don't you know?
MRS. DICKSON: No.
CLUETT: I want to be near you!
MRS. DICKSON: What?
CLUETT: Don't you know I've been crazy about you for years?
MRS. DICKSON: Now wait a minute, wait a minute...
CLUETT: I've loved you ever since I can remember, long before you married Tom Dickson.
MRS. DICKSON: Why, Cyril, you're insane—
CLUETT: No. No, I'm not. I deliberately avoided you. I was afraid of making a fool of myself. But I won't stand it any longer—
MRS. DICKSON: Cyril!
