Possible "Scarlet Letter" on my profile?
Hello,

Some quick background - took a job in 10/18 that I immediately knew was a mistake from my first day. Been pretty miserable since with the role and BIG company, and at about the 6-month mark a lot of my applications were getting serious consideration, and since I work in a semi-specialized function that is suddenly in demand it seemed just a matter of time till I got a new gig.

Fast forward to June of this year - I interview with a BIG company from June-Sept, 2-hour personality test, 2 convos with Hiring Manager, talk to VP, fly out to the office, and then don't get the job.Ok - was shocked after multiple conversations with the Hiring Manager but I guess something happened in that final interview.

Then another company comes along. Interview with them from August - October and go through 8 rounds and don't get that gig. This included a Hiring Manager who knew a lot of my contacts well and told me on the phone I came highly regarded, etc, etc. and she wanted me on the team. Call from the recruiter - "sorry"

Another I just heard back from (which i really wanted and took 8 weeks!) did 7 rounds, interviewed with Hiring Manager twice, including 2nd interview where we were vibing and she was talking about me in the role in present tense and 3 people from the team, including the last one who "I would be working closely with"

Now none of these have done a background check- but I did get a job in 10/18 so I should be good there (nothing has happened to me legally or otherwise). Google search is pretty standard, but I feel like I would be vetted out earlier if there was something negative I'm not seeing.

Im confused why I am getting so close every time - the HM is loving me, interviews go well, follow-up emails, and then suddenly it's like sorry after months of interviews. Not even getting to the negotiation stage. What am I missing?

**UPDATE**

After asking for feedback ...” as I strive to improve my interview skills, whether that was a piece of experience that was lacking or a misstep I made in the interview process, or perhaps a way I can better present myself in future interviews.”

I received this:

“The hiring team enjoyed meeting with you! The candidate selected had more closely aligned experience to the role.”

Which leaves much to be desired. The role asked for 3 years of experience in the field, I have 7... etc.

**UPDATE II**

Hiring Manager (would be Boss) reached out directly (not sure if it was b/c I reached out to recruiter) but was very nice and wanted to "close the loop".  Said I came in 2nd place, basically a toss-up, another person had a bit more experience with a direct competitor. Said it was great to talk to me and the team enjoyed our conversations. Nice bit of closure to be honest. Still doesn't feel great, but better than what I have ever got before and helped me not think I'm losing my mind.
