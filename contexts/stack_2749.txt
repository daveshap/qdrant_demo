Static temperature A Professor of Fluid Mechanics a told that the static temperature is the temperature observed when the relative speed between observer(thermometer) and fluid is zero.I have trouble understanding as to how will the temperature of fluid depend on the reference frame since temperature is a quantity which should be a function of Static Pressure and not Pressure itself.How can the temperature of a body depend on its speed?
