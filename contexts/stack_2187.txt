Other computers can't connect to my server I've Just created a minecraft 1.11.2 server(the official download from minecraft.net), and set it up. I can join it from my computer using localhost. However, no other computers can connect to it(they get the message:\"can't connect to server\". I can't connect to it using the ip either. I am running OX Yosemite and have no firewall on. Also, I've made sure to whitelist the other computer(which is not on the same LAN network). Does anyone know how to fix this?
