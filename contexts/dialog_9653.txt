PARRY: Well, I think you should be realistic. Ya can't start an ad agency on fifty dollars!
JACK: What are you doing? Give that back!
JACK: But I gave it to you!
PARRY: Well what am I gonna do with it?
JACK: I don't know. But I gave it to you...to help YOU...not him.
PARRY: You really want to help me?
PARRY: Pretty impressive huh?...Don't let it scare you. I'll admit it's formidable but everything has it's weakness.
JACK: You can't just break into Langdon Carmichael's house. This man has done nothing.
PARRY: O.K...let me explain this one more time...The Holly Grail is in -....
JACK: All right! Listen - please...don't start drooling or...rolling your eyes when I tell you this but - You shouldn't do this..There is no Holy Grail.
PARRY: Of course there is, Jack. What do you think the Crusades were - a frat initiation? I don't think so...There has to be a Grail.
JACK: Look, you're only sort of insane, really. People like you can lead semi-normal lives. You could get a job...
PARRY: I don't need a job. I have a quest.
JACK: I take it back - you're fucking deranged... And you're going to get yourself killed trying to get in there!
PARRY: Tch. You are so sweet...Now I know why you're saying this. ...You're afraid I'm in danger and you're trying to protect me.
JACK: No. I think you're a moron and I don't want to get into trouble.
PARRY: ...You are such a great guy. First the money, now this. Isn't he fabulous!?
JACK: Please don't hug me in public again, O.K.?
PARRY: I LOVE THIS MAN...YA HEAR ME JADED CITY... ...I'M DAFFY ABOUT THIS GUY AND I DON'T CARE WHO KNOWS IT!!!
JACK: Will you shut-up!!!
PARRY: You're a true <u>friend</u>.
JACK: I'm not. Believe me. <u>I'm</u> scum.
PARRY: You're a real honest to goodness <u>good</u> guy.
JACK: I'm self-centered, I'm weak - I don't have the will power of a <u>fly</u> on shit...
PARRY: That's why the Little People sent you. Just <u>like</u> magic.
JACK: I don't believe in little floating people! THERE IS NO MAGIC!
PARRY: So what? You going to help me?
JACK: WILL YOU PLEASE... please listen to me ... You know none of this is true - PARRY the Grail, the voices... Jack... There's a part of you that Come on...what are knows this isn't true. saying... I know who you are... I know who you are.. or who you were. You're acting really- You don't belong on the No, no, no, no... streets. You're intelligent Jack... man....you're a teacher... Jacck!...
