How do you handle a snarky petty coworker when you sit three feet from each other?
I have a coworker who is always making snarky comments. Today I let my group know I would be in late this morning. I came in at 10:30.  Our manager was having a closed door meeting with two other managers. I said to my coworker, 'haha those meetings always make me paranoid." She said, "they should since you come in at 10:30 today with your unannounced appointment."

We have completely different jobs in our department. Whether I am here or not has no affect on her. I find it very rude when people comment on how you use your PTO.  She is the type who never takes lunches, has no work friends because she is extremely competitive etc. How do you handle this type of person? We have to sit RIGHT next to each other.
