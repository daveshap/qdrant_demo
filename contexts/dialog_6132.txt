RANDAL: Helluva game!
DANTE: One ball!! They come all the way here... I close the damn store... for one ball!
RANDAL: Hockey's hockey. At least we got to play.
DANTE: Randal, twelve minutes is not a game! Jesus, it's barely a warm-up!
RANDAL: Bitch, bitch, bitch. You want something to drink?
DANTE: Gatorade.
RANDAL: What happened to all the Gatorade?
DANTE: Exactly. They drank it all.
RANDAL: After an exhausting game like that I can believe it.
DANTE: It's not like we're gonna sell out.""
RANDAL: You know what Sanford told me?
DANTE: I still can't believe Caitlin's getting married.
RANDAL: Julie Dwyer died.
DANTE: Yeah, right.
RANDAL: No, I'm serious.
DANTE: Oh, my god.
RANDAL: Sanford's brother dates her cousin. He found out this morning.
DANTE: How? When?
RANDAL: Embolism in her brain. Yesterday.
DANTE: Jesus.
RANDAL: She was swimming at the YMCA pool when it happened. Died mid-backstroke.
DANTE: I haven't seen her in almost two years.
RANDAL: Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't she one of the illustrious twelve?
DANTE: Number six.
RANDAL: You've had sex with a dead person.
DANTE: I'm gonna go to her wake.
RANDAL: No, you're not.
DANTE: Why not?
RANDAL: It's today.
DANTE: What!?
RANDAL: Paulsen's Funeral Parlor. The next show is at four.
DANTE: Shit. What about tomorrow?
RANDAL: One night only. She's buried in the morning.
DANTE: You've gotta watch the store. I have to go to this.
RANDAL: Wait, wait, wait. Has it occurred to you that I might bereaved as well?
DANTE: You hardly knew her!
RANDAL: True, but do you know how many people are going to be there? All of our old classmates, to say the least.
DANTE: Stop it. This is beneath even you.
RANDAL: I'm not missing what's probably going to be the social event of the season.
DANTE: You hate people.
RANDAL: But I love gatherings. Isn't it ironic?
DANTE: Don't be an asshole. Somebody has to stay with the store.
RANDAL: If you go, I go.
DANTE: She meant nothing to you!
RANDAL: She meant nothing to you either until I told you she died.
DANTE: I'm not taking you to this funeral.
RANDAL: I'm going with you.
DANTE: I can't close the store.
RANDAL: You just closed the store to play hockey on the roof!
DANTE: Exactly, which means I can't close it for another hour so we can both go to a wake.
RANDAL: You were saying?
DANTE: Thanks for putting me in a tough spot. You're a good friend.
RANDAL: She was pretty young, hunhh?
DANTE: Twenty-two; same as us.
RANDAL: An embolism in a pool.
DANTE: An embarrassing way to die.
RANDAL: That's nothing compared to how my cousin Walter died.
DANTE: How'd he die?
RANDAL: Broke his neck.
DANTE: That's embarrassing?
RANDAL: He broke his neck trying to suck his own dick.
DANTE: Shut the hell up.
RANDAL: Bible truth.
DANTE: Stop it.
RANDAL: I swear.
DANTE: Oh, my god.
RANDAL: Come on. Haven't you ever tried to suck your own dick?
DANTE: No!
RANDAL: Yeah sure. You're so repressed.
DANTE: Because I never tried to suck my own dick?
RANDAL: No, because you won't admit to it. As if a guy's a fucking pervert because he tries to go down on himself. You're as curious as the rest of us, pal. You've tried it.
DANTE: Who found him?
RANDAL: My cousin? My aunt found him. On his bed, doubled over himself with his legs on top. Dick in his mouth. My aunt freaked out. It was a mess.
DANTE: His dick was in his mouth?
RANDAL: Balls resting on his lips.
DANTE: He made it, hunhh?
RANDAL: Yeah, but at what a price.
DANTE: I could never reach.
RANDAL: Reach what?
DANTE: You know.
RANDAL: What, your dick?
DANTE: Yeah. Like you said, you know. I guess everyone tries it, sooner of later.
RANDAL: I never tried it.
