Does accuracy lower for higher level weapons? I came across a level 15 axe with really high damage (I am 12), and while in the first game, over-leveled weapons could not be equipped, in this one they can, granted you have the associated stat high enough (strength in this case).However, it seems that it's greatly reduced my ability to hit enemies, with the weapon itself and skills associated with it. There's no indicator on the weapon that this is the case, am I just unlucky or do over-leveled weapons actually lower your accuracy when using them.
