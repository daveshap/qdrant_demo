Will a \"big rip\" scenario cause an \"absolute zero universe\"? To my best understanding, in a \"big rip\" scenario the universe expands faster and faster, until it expands between particles faster than the particles can hold one another.Does that mean that at some point atoms reach temperature of 0 Kelvin, because the universe expands so fast, there is no way to actually \"move\" anywhere? How does that work with quantum uncertainty?
