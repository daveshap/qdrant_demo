Anyone who realized that what they want to do in life is completely different from what they studied in college? How did you go about it?
So, I’ve always been interested in many things, which made it hard for me to figure out what I wanted to do in life. I’ve tried both the natural and the social sciences, but eventually went for a BA in English. After all, I loved writing and reading.

After about three years of working, I just realized that writing for a living just isn’t for me. Now, I want to go back to one of my first loves—environment and the natural world. 

How do I bridge this knowledge gap? Literally the only thing I can do is write. Right now, my plan is to work as a writer or communications officer in related agencies, then later pursue a master’s degree once I have enough work experience. Is this the right approach?

Has anyone been in a similar situation? Especially someone who also switched from the arts to the sciences? How did you do it? How difficult was it to transition to a completely different field?

**Edit: Thanks so much for all the insight! Definitely gave a me a new perspective and helped reinforce some ideas. Now, at least I know which ones to prioritize and ponder on. I initially planned on replying to everyone, but this exploded and I’m not so sure I could! (Will do my best.)**

I just want to clarify a few things since they’re often brought up:

- I’m currently taking some online courses on the subject to see if I’d really be interested in them, as well as to narrow down my interests. I’m not planning to look for jobs until next year, so I have a lot of time! (Keeping my writing job for now.)
- Once the pandemic dies down, I do plan on volunteering on an environmental advocacy org. It’s a little intimidating because I’ve never done this before, but I do want to have hands-on experience (and network while I’m at it).
- I don’t plan going straight back to school! I really want to have some related experience in the field before I do and be really sure I like the subject. I don’t want to make the same mistake again.
- I know I did say I started to “hate” writing, but I also know that it’s my most marketable skill right now. The positions I’m targeting are definitely writing-related. If this pans out, maybe I’d end up sticking with it, who knows.
- I’m doing content writing right now, which has been really soul-sucking for me. Plus, I’ve also stopped doing creative writing, which was my major and something I thought I’d want to do for the rest of my life. (Hence, the “I hate writing” bit.) But I know there’s more to writing than long-form content and creative works, so I’m now exploring other forms, like technical, social media, and mass media writing, etc. I’m liking them better so far (esp news writing).
