LOTHOS: I find it restorative, sleeping in the life-blood of so many. To feel their souls coursing about me.
CASSANDRA: What's happening? What do you want?
LOTHOS: So very much.
CASSANDRA: My parents have money...
LOTHOS: Yes, I'm sure they do. This place is everything you said it was, Amilyn.
CASSANDRA: What... are you?
LOTHOS: Are we so strange? So alien to you? I've seen this culture, the wealth, the greed, the waste... it's truly heartwarming. The perfect place to spread my empire. Honestly, Eastern Europe was so dead, the Communists just drained the blood out of the place. It's livened up a bit in the past few years, but it's nothing compared to this.... this Mecca of consumption. The city of Angels.
