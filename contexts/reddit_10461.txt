It's 11:40 and I'm gonna kill myself at midnight.
Not here to be talked out of it, just wanted to say something anonymously I guess. I just got dealt a shitty hand in life in a lot of ways. Sure not as shitty as some others have it, but it's all shitty. I was never meant to find someone to be happy with or anything like that, I was always meant to die alone. I tried to avoid it but by 30 it became clear the path I was going down.

More importantly, I just never was happy with myself or life in general. Losing loved ones, losing touch with friends and never making new ones, being bored with the work I chose but having no interest in going back to school. Life is just not worth it to me. Lots of suffering and sadness with not much upside. I said if I wasn't feeling better by 31 I'd end it, and here I am. I'll miss my family but I'm done "being strong for others." Time to take care of myself.

I chose a method that is very lethal and should go quick. Yeah I know "you might screw up" but oh well, that's a risk I'll take. Oh and I'm sure someone will show up to tell me I'll go to hell like they always do to people here, and yeah, I'm shaking in my boots ;) lol.

Holy shit, 15 minutes now as I write this. I'm scared obviously but also excited. It'll finally be done.

Good luck everyone no matter your situation, if you choose to keep going I hope you end up better than I did. Bye.
