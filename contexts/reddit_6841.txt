I just got confirmation that I will be fired in the upcoming weeks. How do I overcome the shame and the dreadful anxiety of this unstable future?
I love my job. It's my first job, I've been there for a year and a half, and I work in healthcare marketing. However it's a demanding position and my managers wanted someone more senior than me but didn't have the resources. They have been chronically unsatisfied with my work (although there are some aspects that I master) and think I'm just incompetent and will never be able to negotiate the learning curve.

So today I got the confirmation that they are having talks about laying me off and starting a new team from scratch, without me. I'm very grateful that I got a heads up and I started applying elsewhere but how do you get over the shame of being fired? of not being good at a job that I love?

I keep seeing my coworkers evolve, achieve milestones and get promotions and being good at what they do and I just feel so ashamed. I can't deal with this reality. I'm overwhelmed with the anxiety of not knowing what awaits me in the future.

Help me, give me some perspective because I feel so hopeless and bleak.
