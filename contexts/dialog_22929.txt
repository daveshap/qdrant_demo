JIM: Well, let me start it. I'm flying down to Los Angeles on business, and I decide to take her on her first aeroplane.
DIANE: I knew how planes flew, but I was still a little nervous.
JIM: Crash paranoia.
LLOYD: Oh.
DIANE: I had a checklist in mind. I thought that if babies were on the plane, the plane couldn't crash. But all the babies were crying, and I thought they knew something I didn't.
JIM: So anyway, they closed the doors, and she starts to scream. I've never in my life heard anyone scream quite like that.
DIANE: And then you got up and you told them to turn the plane around.
JIM: Which they did. Let me finish.
DIANE: Okay, I give up.
JIM: So anyway, these two federal marshals meet the plane, and they take our address, and they ask us never to fly with 'Friendly Skies' again.
