BRUCE: I'm Batman? I remember my life as Bruce Wayne. But all this. It's like the life of a stranger.
ALFRED: Perhaps the fall...
BRUCE: There's one other thing. I feel..
ALFRED: What?
BRUCE: ...Afraid.
ALFRED: Bruce. Son. Listen to me. You are a kind man. A strong man. But in truth you are not the most sane man.
BRUCE: ...A bat.
ALFRED: What?
BRUCE: I remember a bat. A monster. A demon. Chasing me. Oh my God, Alfred.
ALFRED: No demons, son. Your monsters are here. Until you fact that, I fear you will spend your life fleeing them.
