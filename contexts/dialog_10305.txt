DRIVER: I used to be head of neurosurgery. Big hospital in USSR. This hospital, I'm not kidding.
NICKY: Very big.
DRIVER: I opened thousands of brains.
NICKY: What did you find?
DRIVER: Big mess every time.
NICKY: I loved my taxi. Went twelve hours nonstop. Stopped only to pee. I peed under the Manhattan bridge. Peed many times in parks and playgrounds.
JOANNA: Last night. Alan Albright called me a handsome woman. Second time he's done that. Son of a bitch.
NICKY: I hear Alan's sick.
JOANNA: Alan's very sick. He has to go to New Mexico and sit in a lukewarm solution.
NICKY: You know about Adele.
JOANNA: What about her?
NICKY: She's dying.
JOANNA: She died.
NICKY: I talked to her two days ago.
JOANNA: Apparently it didn't help. You know about Peter, of course.
NICKY: Our Peter?
JOANNA: Peter Redmond. They found out why he can't remember his lines. There's something living in his brain. A parasite he picked up in Borneo, doing the movie.
NICKY: Can he get through it?
JOANNA: They're watching him closely. There's a special rehearsal set for this afternoon. To bolster his confidence. And that's not all.
NICKY: I've got bigger problems, Joanna. Personal problems.
JOANNA: That's not all, Nicky. I've been backing your plays for fifteen years. And I've never been more depressed.
NICKY: About what?
JOANNA: Steven Schwimmer. The most powerful critic in America gets his first crack at Nicky Rogan.
NICKY: Look. All I want is a haircut. I'm not worried about this guy.
JOANNA: Ever since he started reviewing the Broadway theater, nobody in this business has been worried about anything else.
NICKY: They can send their heartless brilliant boy-critic. There's a much bigger thing going on than tonight's opening.
JOANNA: What?
NICKY: The Red Sox
JOANNA: You mean the World Series? I thought the Red Sox were winning.
NICKY: Three games to two. But if you know their history, you realize there's a tragedy in the making. I've been carrying this franchise on my back since I was six years old.
JOANNA: It can't be all that personal.
