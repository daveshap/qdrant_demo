Recover password that contains known phrase I want to recover a long password with hashcat. The password contains a phrase and between the words are special character sequences. These sequences are limited (&lt; 4) and unknown. But the set of characters to pick from is known and small (&lt; 6).Example Phrase: Barbara walks the dog<br>Special Characters: $%-\"<br>Possible Password: Barbara%walks$$%the$dogI tried to generate all the passwords with regex but that file grew too big. How do I achieve this with hashcat e.g. their rule system?
