JULIET: I'm saving them for a rainy day.
HONORA: gives her a sympathetic look.
HONORA: I know it's hard for you being in here, but it is for the good of your health.
JULIET: They sent me off to the Bahamas for the good of my health." They sent me to the Bay of bloody Islands "for the good of my health.""
HONORA: looks startled at the outburst.

HONORA: We don't want to tire you out, dear.
HONORA: stands and picks up her handbag. Pauline stands and Juliet grabs her hand.
JULIET: Can't you stay a bit longer, Paul?
