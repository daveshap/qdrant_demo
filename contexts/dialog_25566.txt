HAN: I'm Han Solo, Captain of this vessel. Who's in charge then?
BEN: I'm Ben Kenobi. Luke Starkiller here is leading our expedition.
HAN: Organa Major is a rebel system. There will be quite a few starfleet patrols between here and there... It could be a little tricky if you want to avoid them... ten thousand.
LUKE: That's pretty steep. We'd like to talk it over first.
LUKE: We don't have that kind of money. How much do you think I can get for the speeder?
BEN: Five, maybe. Let me handle it.
