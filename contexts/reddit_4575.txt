My existence is meaningless
I have no desire to live and I don't know why.  I don't think my life is that awful to be honest, I have issues but who doesn't in this world? 
There's absolutely nothing that interests me. I used to think the reason of my unhappiness is not having money. So I became obsessed with money. Now I got a higher paying job, saved a lot of money and pretty much I only work 5 hours a day, yet I am still not happy. I am just so tired of feeling dull and bored. I don't know what I want, why im alive. I envy people who enjoy life and I wish I could give the rest of my lifetime to somebody who wants it. 
I can't sleep every night because the thought of ending my life is so strong yet I dont know what is causing my suicidal thoughts.
