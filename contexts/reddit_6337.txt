Why your job search isn't working
As a recruiter who stumbled upon this subreddit a month or so ago, I have seen a lot of the same issues come up time and time again that lead people to unsuccessful job searches. I wanted to share the biggest items, and some suggestions for those who have been perpetually searching for awhile to see if some of these problems could be solved, and everyone can land their next job. Job searching is such a mentally, physically, and emotionally draining experience. Your livelihood is at stake, and it's really easy to shut down after awhile.

**Problem #1: Lack of networking, resume blasting**

I often see posts with "I have sent 100, 200, 500, 1000, etc., resumes and have had no luck so far!" Part of this has to do with a sense of entitlement. People have degrees and work experience, and by sending a resume, if they are vaguely qualified (or feel they are) for a position, they feel everything should fall into place. 

Most positions I recruit for garner 50-200 applications for one opening. Honestly, after removing the under-qualified people, most resumes tend to look the same. A few will stand out, but a majority are at about the same experience and skill level. Most recruiters juggle 15-20 open positions at a time. It is impossible, and inefficient to interview all of them, beyond the ones that really stick out. So what do we do in situations like that? We look at our own network, and for referrals.

Say you have a high performing employee that comes to you with a great candidate for one of your open positions. You trust them since they are the ideal employee. Recruiting is all about trying to remove as much uncertainty about candidates as possible. If they vouch for this person, chances are they are just as good, if not better. I almost always will give referrals at least a phone interview, even if they may be a bit underqualified from an education/experience standpoint. Why? Because if they get the respect of a current, high performing employee, they probably have the drive to work hard for any gaps they may have. I'll take those top few resumes, plus referrals, and interview those individuals. This means if you don't stick out beyond the typical person, or know someone within the organization, you are already way behind.

What's the takeaway? Make sure your resume is top-notch. Get HR professionals, and those working in your field to review your resume constantly. Make sure you tailor your resume to each position you apply for. Stop blasting resumes and find positions that you want the most and focus on those. If you're sending 500 resumes, you obviously don't want a specific position with a specific company, you just want a job. That often shows through. Network constantly within and outside of your organization. Remember, networking isn't about looking for something, it's about spending time and essentially creating a friendship. Use your company, past companies, professional organizations, HR professionals, and company executives as the best place to start. LinkedIn helps a lot. See if you have a connection at the company with an open position, and reach out to them.

**Problem 2: "I get interviews, but never hear back"**

If you get interviews, but never get beyond the first round, this tells you two things. One, your resume is good enough to get you an interview. Celebrate and recognize that. Second, your interviewing skills are obviously lacking. Ask HR professionals or managers within your field to help you with a mock interview. Bring them the job description, and they can ask questions that will closely match what you can expect for a certain position. Find someone that will be brutally honest, and be open to their criticisms. Work on your responses and mindset, and continue until you receive mostly positive feedback. 

Good recruiters should give you a deadline of when you can expect to hear back. If they don't, be sure to ask at the end of the interview. If it's been 24 hours after you were told you would hear back, an e-mail or call is appropriate. Be proactive, and don't wait on a company. The golden rule of job hunting is to work like you don't have anything in the works until you have an offer in your hands. If a company isn't getting back to you after multiple attempts, it may not be the type of place you want to work. 

**Problem 3: Poor understanding of recruitment process**

There is a lot of bad advice across places like this subreddit, the blogosphere, and the web in general. When reading articles offering advice, make sure it is from someone who has interviewed people over a long period of time, and/or was in a position to give offers and make hiring decisions. While advice from those who have recently had a successful search can be helpful, keep in mind every position, company, and location looks for different things. Don't overthink things. There's no magic set of actions or words you can use to get a job. It ALWAYS comes down to who meets the qualifications, who has preferred qualities that we are looking for, and who is the best cultural fit for the company. 

Speaking of qualifications, a lot of people are saying apply to everything, even if you're not qualified. Most of the time this is poor advice. I never put required experience on a job posting that isn't necessary for the position. Most companies post required and preferred experience. Required means just that, you need these skills, experiences, and education requirements to successfully perform well in the role. It isn't something we guess, there is a lot of thought and research done before posting an opening. There may be minor areas that companies are willing to forgive if you have a really strong preferred skill, but no manager I work with is going to invest in someone under qualified. Remember volunteer experience, or even some duties for a non-related position can count as experience if you can show how it gained that skill that they are looking for. It doesn't always need to be for pay.

The best thing to do is to put yourself in the recruiter's shoes. Look at the job description. If you needed to hire this person, where would you look? What type of person would you look for? What would you want to see on a resume? You need to emulate that person. Know the company, know the job, provide examples of how your experiences meet those qualifications. 

**Problem 4: Letting failure bring you down**

Rejection is hard. When you get that letter, "we are pursuing other candidates at this time," it is hard to deal with. Being told you're not good enough is hard. Or is it? When we send rejection e-mails out, it does not always mean you weren't qualified. Remember we receive hundreds of applications for 1 open position. To say only 1 person could do the job out of 100-200 would be a lie. The only issue is that we have to choose only one person for the opening. Use this as an opportunity by saying, "Thank you for letting me know. I appreciate the opportunity to learn more about your organization, and I thank you for your consideration. Your company is one I greatly respect, and would love to work for someday. I hope you will keep me in mind for future opportunities with your company!" Keep in mind that sometimes you aren't qualified. But if you've had a few interviews, and someone else is chosen, it is likely that someone was just a little bit better in some way, or had some preferred skill that you may not have. Using it as a networking opportunity can help you down the road if you have left a positive impression. 

After 6 months to a year of no luck, it can take a huge toll on you. Speak with someone that you can vent with. Seek professional help if needed. Keep yourself healthy. It will be hard to come off positively in an interview if you are too pessimistic and depressed. Make sure you are okay with you, so you can present the best version of yourself.



And most importantly, best of luck! Always be prepared to know what you would do tomorrow if you lost your job today. Hopefully this helps some of you, I'll answer any questions you have. Sorry for the length!




**TL;DR:** A lot of weird advice exists here and all over the internet. Take with a grain of salt. Put yourself in a recruiter's shoes when looking, and emulate the person you would look for if you needed to fill the position. Network, network, network. Be proactive and don't wait on anyone or anything, keep moving forward. Accurately assess your successes and gaps, and fix gaps to improve your chances. Don't do it alone, utilize the many resources out there at your disposal.

**Final Edit:** Thank you to everyone who was open minded and participated in a respectful manner. It's too bad that those trying to help receive treatment like this due to a job title and a misunderstanding of their field. Due to the overwhelming amount of negativity going on in this thread, I am going to ask that if you have serious questions regarding your job search, that you send them via PM, and I will do my best to respond timely.  

I get that a lot of people out there are frustrated due to the state of the job market. If it is therapeutic for those unfairly being unemployed so long to take their frustrations out on recruiters, so be it. I am glad this post can at least provide that. Please remember while job hunting is draining and difficult, blaming others, or the system, isn't going to provide job offers. Please keep that goal in mind, and focus your energy on steps to help you find the next step in your career.

For each negative comment, there were also many engaging, helpful questions asked by participants. Thank you for those, and I hope this post can provide some ideas to change things up to generate new leads for your job hunt.
