People only care after we are dead.
Honestly the worst part of the process of recovering from mental illness, is no one cares enough to lend a helping hand despite knowing our situation except the one person you’re paying money to, the therapist. And then once we actually are gone, they start caring. Until then we are alone in the fight, and are judged for not getting through the storm alone. 

I wish it was different but it feels like I am a laughing stock and stepping stone for people to trample on as some trash along the road. It’s great
