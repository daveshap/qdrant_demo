TIM: I threw up.
GRANT: That's okay. Listen, give me your hand.
GRANT: Okay, that's not so bad, ah Tim?
TIM: Yes it is.
GRANT: It's just like coming out of a tree house. Did your dad ever build you a tree house, Tim, eh?
TIM: No.
GRANT: Me too. Okay. Well, the main thing about climbing is never, never look down, never.
TIM: This is impossible. How am I going...I can't make it. This is...it's about fifty feet.
GRANT: So am I going to help you with your foot?
TIM: What if the car falls? What if the wheels fall?
