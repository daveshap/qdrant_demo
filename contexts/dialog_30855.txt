ROWAN: I'm going to have a baby. Michael wants to name it after you - if it's a girl. Diedre Mayfair Curry. Pretty, huh...? Funny --- I never really thought I'd ever ---
LASHER: I bring her flowers too.
LASHER: There is no one here but the dead.
ROWAN: Go away! I don't want you here.
LASHER: If that were true, I would not be here.
ROWAN: It's very dangerous to assume you know what a woman wants.
LASHER: From the night on the moor, when I was swept into the world and first knew this exquisite pain - it is a Mayfair who has wanted me! suzann. and Deborah. Stella - Marguerite - Antha - Diedre - All of them. And you will have a child...
LASHER: A girl...?
ROWAN: It's too soon to know.
