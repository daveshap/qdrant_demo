PRITCHETT: -- then I guess then it had to be you. Sorry.
PRICE: Thank God -- I was afraid I'd be lynched without a quorum.
SARA: If you've got a gun on you, Price, I'd hand it over now.
PRICE: Not just yet. Would any of you be interested in knowing exactly why I ended up here in the basement?
SARA: Fascinated.
PRICE: I was chasing after somebody I saw in the salon.
BLACKBURN: Oh, really: who?
PRICE: Didn't catch his or her name, just followed them down here. Somebody all in white surgical gown.
PRITCHETT: Vannacutt!!
PRICE: Or somebody wanting me to believe that.
SARA: Well, I don't.
PRICE: Then just wait -- maybe this whoever's got you next on the Asylum's equipment- test list. Maybe a literal mind-blow inside the Saturation Chamber.""
SARA: I'll take my chances.
PRICE: Well, I can't, sweetheart.
BLACKBURN: If there really is someone else in this house, I think the four of us can handle the situation.
PRICE: I think one of you has been part and parcel of making this situation!
