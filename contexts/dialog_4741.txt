JACK: Sam!
SAM: Jack!
JACK: Long time no see!
SAM: Well, since you disappeared up the ladder of Information Retrieval ... I don't expect to see you slumming in Records - what's the problem?
JACK: Problem? - No problem - yes, everything's going fantastically well, wonderful, marvelous, great career prospects, Alison in great shape, kids fine, beautiful home, I'm on Security Level Five now, and Mr Helpmann relies on me more and more, yes, couldn't be better, I feel terrifically motivated and job- rewarded -
SAM: You sound worried.
JACK: Me? - if I'm worried about anyone, it's you. What happened to you, Sam? You were the brightest of us -
JACK: What's the matter?
SAM: Sorry. Nothing. See you - I'm going to be late.
JACK: You are late.
SAM: Even later.
JACK: Sam, your life is going wrong - let your friends tell you - Records is a dead end department, no Security Level worth a damn, it's impossible to get noticed -
SAM: Yes, I know, fantastic, marvellous, wonderful - remember me to Alison - and the - er - twins.
JACK: Triplets.
SAM: Really? - God, how time flies!
JILL: I want to report a wrongful arrest.
PORTER: You want Information Adjustments. Different department.
JILL: I've been to Information Adjustments. They sent me here. They told me you had a form I had to fill in.
PORTER: Have you got an Arrest Receipt?
JILL: Yes.
PORTER: Is it stamped?
JILL: Stamped?
PORTER: No, there's no stamp on it. You see! I can't give you the form until it's stamped.
JILL: Where do I get it stamped?
PORTER: Information Adjustments.
KURTZMAN: Perhaps the machine's on the blink! It keeps picking up old films. That can't he right, can it?
SAM: It's not the machine. There's a mismatch on the personnel code numbers... Ah there we go! That's a B58/732 when it should be a T47/215 ... Tuttle ... he should have Â£31.06, debited against his account for electrical procedures, not Buttle.
KURTZMAN: Oh my God, a mistake!
SAM: It's not our mistake!
KURTZMAN: Isn't it? Whose is it?
SAM: Information Retrieval.
KURTZMAN: Oh, good!
SAM: Expediting has put in for electrical procedures in respect of Buttle, Archibald, shoe repair operative, but Security has invoiced Admin for Tuttle, Archibald, heating engineer
KURTZMAN: What a relief! I don't know what I'd do if you ever got promoted.
SAM: Don't worry.
KURTZMAN: But if they did promote you
SAM: I've told you before. I'd turn it down.
KURTZMAN: Would you really, Sam?
SAM: Really.
KURTZMAN: You've been promoted.
KURTZMAN: It's your mother isn't it? Pulling strings again.
SAM: What a BITCH!
