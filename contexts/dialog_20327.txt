COUNSEL: You mean to sit there and tell me that your local takes in sixty-five thousand, five hundred dollars every year and keeps no financial records?
BIG MAC: Sure we keep records!
COUNSEL: Well, where are they?
BIG MAC: We was robbed last night and we can't find no books.
COUNSEL: Doesn't it seem odd to you that five different waterfront locals were broken into last night and the only articles removed were financial records?
BIG MAC: What do you mean, odd? We was robbed like I told you.
COUNSEL: That's all. Next witness!
