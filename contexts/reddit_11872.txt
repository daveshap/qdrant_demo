I am unemployed but i don't look for a job.
I am currently unemployed since seven months. I have quited my last job in a fast food who was slowly killing my mental health. I hated waking up everyday for earning my money in a job I hated, so i started attending a coding bootcamp that I finished four months ago.

During Summer, I was telling myself that I needed some real vacations and to enjoy time with my friends.

I was supposed to restart searching jobs in September, but I didn't send more than maybe 10 resumes in two months.

Instead, I just routinely play video games and read books and fuck around being useless to society.

I do nothing and I am so tired, I don't know why.  I don't do anything productive with my time, I don't code or improve my skills, I don't help people with volunteering, but I dread to feel myself trapped and miserable and unworthy again.

I know it is not sustainable, that the money will run short, but this fact don't do anything  to "wake" me.
