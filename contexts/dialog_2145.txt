DOUG: I'd love to get in there.
CHRIS: Don't we have enough already?
DOUG: It must be fair old size, suppose it's empty?
CHRIS: And suppose a little old lady lives there?
DOUG: No way, it's sealed - if she's in there she's dead.
CHRIS: Sounds like a good reason to leave it alone.
DOUG: Just think though, it would make a hell of a cafe, that way we keep the auditorium clear.
DOUG: Well, it's definitely there - We've just got to get to it.
CHRIS: Why, how in the hell are we going to set up a cafe?
DOUG: I'll rig up something don't worry - Do you think I could bash through with that little hammer?
CHRIS: I don't know Doug, we haven't even got the place together and already you want to extend it.
DOUG: Don't worry if the old lady's there I'll brick it back up.
CHRIS: Look I gotta get going, shouldn't you have met Katka?
DOUG: Is it gone four-thirty?
