I got into a car accident this morning and my last thought before impact was “I hope this kills me”.
I hit my head and likely have a concussion. I’ve had headaches and slight dizziness all day. Can’t afford the doctors bills, and it’s the end of the year so it’s not like paying towards my deductible would do any good. So, may as well say fuck it, hope that I die in my sleep, and let it be. Suicide to me has become similar to the ending of Batman Begins. “I won’t kill you, but I don’t have to save you.” So bring on the tobacco, liquor, or whatever. Let it be “stoicistic suicide”.
