Words cannot describe how proud of myself I am right now.
Hands shaking, heart pounding, I told the guy at TSA that I had never flown alone and he reassured me that they were always there to help. Hands still shaking and heart still pounding, I went through TSA keeping a close eye on my valuables. A little less shakily, I found my gate.  Waiting to board. I have never been more proud of myself than I am right now.
