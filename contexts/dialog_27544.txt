JACQUES: I remember. Hi Roberto!
ENZO: What room have you got?
JACQUES: I don't have one.
ENZO: You don't have a room? Paolo? What did I just hear? I personally called you to reserve a room for my good friend Jacques Mayol and you treat him like a stranger?!
JACQUES: It's okay, Enzo. I'll go somewhere else.
ENZO: Not only is Jacques Mayol a very special friend, but he happens to be one of the best divers in the world! And you're throwing him out! Are you crazy, or what? Stupido!
JACQUES: Enzo drop it, I'll find something.
