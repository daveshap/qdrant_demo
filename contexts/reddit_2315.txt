Class of 2021, I hope we all get into our dream schools.
I just finished watching a live student panel for my dream school, and I was close to tears seeing them talk about how welcoming and supportive their community is and how beautiful the campus is. Being in an very toxic and competitive high school with severe budget cuts for the past 3 years, there is nothing I want more than to join a university where students support each other instead of putting each other down. This school might be a reach for me, but I hope next year I can say that *I gaucho back :)* It's been a real struggle, especially with the pandemic taking away part of an important school year and probably our senior year (the only year Iâ€™ve looked forward to).  I hope that we all find happiness at the end of the admissions process and go to the school perfect for us.
