I feel like a failure.
I received an email last night, informing me my uni application had been rejected. I've been rejected from all three courses I applied for, and now I don't know what to do with myself.

The plan was that I'd move in with the boyfriend (who's currently living about 2 - 2 and a half hours away by train), go back to school for two years, qualify as a teacher. Get a job, get married, have a family. But now I'm not going back to school. And sure, I can apply again next year, but I don't want to have to add another year on to basically starting my life.

At the moment I'm working two part time jobs, while still living at home with parents and 17 year old sister. I'll be 26 next month and I just feel stuck. I don't really know what I want to do now, beyond move in with the boyfriend, but I can't do that until I have a job in his city and I don't even know what I want to do. 

My sister passed her driving test this morning - something else which I've also failed at. It's been several years since I failed, but I don't have the time or money to retake lessons again. I just...I don't really care so much about the driving, I hate driving, but I just feel like it's one more thing that I can't do.

On top of this, I woke up with a horrible head cold this morning, so as well as feeling like a failure, I'm also miserable and snotty.
