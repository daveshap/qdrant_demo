JORDAN: So? Isn't the President jumping on your bandwagon?
DEHAVEN: What he did was light the bandwagon on fire. Because he knows what I know -- that American families are not prepared to put their daughters in harm's way.
JORDAN: You don't know that.
DEHAVEN: In face, I do: Roper, Harris, Gallop -- they all come back the same.
JORDAN: What are you saying? That a women's life is more valuable than a man's? That a women's death hurts a family more?
DEHAVEN: I'm saying it's not going to happen. Not when the President is set to turn this into a third-rail issue should I choose to ever campaign against him. He will fry me six ways to Sunday for sending daughters and young mothers off to war -- and, quite possibly, for bringing them back in body bags.
JORDAN: You were never going to let women serve in combat. You always had a safety net. Or thought you did.
DEHAVEN: Jordan. I don't expect you to fully understand this -- but sometimes there's more to be gained from the fight than the victory.
JORDAN: So the rhetoric gets you headlines. But the reality gets you in trouble.
DEHAVEN: The reality is this: We send far too many men off to war. I don't need to compound the problem with women. Can you honestly tell me you wanted that life? Squat-pissing in some third-world jungle with --
JORDAN: I wanted the choice. The chance to prove myself, my skills, my work, me. That's how it should've been.
