At a new job, I have lots of downtime because people are too busy to train me, and am not sure what to do/how to stay productive
I've been at my current job for about a month, I work remotely and due to current circumstances other teammates and my manager are too busy to give me a proper training schedule. Out of a 40 hour week, I maybe get 10 hours of training.

My manager told me that my training would be primarily be two teammates because the work I am to take on is currently their responsibility. I reach out to them a few times a week and they go over things with me via conference callls and screen sharing. They are good teachers and I have been learning a decent amount about how to do my job, but I still have *lots* of down time. I understand that I am not going to be babysat all day, but I have nothing to do. 

I poke around in the various dashboards/spreadsheets that we use all day, but there is only so much of that that I can do. I've asked about things I should be reviewing and they just point me back to those items I was already looking at. I also try to listen in on as many relevant conference calls as I can to just absorb more information, but that has limited value as well given how green I am in this role (my previous job was completely different, I made a lateral move).

Just recently I got to set some quarterly goals with manager (he hasn't reviewed them yet) so I'm hoping he'll get back to me about that and can give me some more guidance...

In the mean time what should I be doing? How can I ask for more to do without being annoying to my manager/teammates? I like this company and this is a job I want to do.
