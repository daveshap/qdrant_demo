Dating as a taller than average woman is tiring
I went on a date today where I didnt know how tall the guy was. It took me an hour to get to our meeting point. I had to wait for him, so I saw him coming from a distance (he told me what he was wearing so I could spot him).. we said hi to each other, he looked up to me (he wasn't even that short; just shorter than me), immediately took out his phone, called someone, received some messages and said he had to leave - all of this in a matter of about 2 minutes. So I drove back home.

But there's one thing i dont understand: in the bio I specifically wrote my height because I get it. Some dudes dont like tall women. No problem with that. But please, the info is there so they can weed me out before trying to meet me...
