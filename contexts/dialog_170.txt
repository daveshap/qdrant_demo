OLEG: What is it?
EMIL: The video of Milos and Tamina - I told you to erase it.
OLEG: I did.
EMIL: And the whore's murder? You didn't erase that either, did you? Don't lie, I won't be angry.
OLEG: Why not?
EMIL: Put the camera down, Oleg.
OLEG: What is that?
EMIL: What does it look like? It's an address book!
OLEG: Let me get a shot of it.
EMIL: Sit down!
OLEG: This way. Hold it this way. Good.
