No internet connection after updating Ubuntu 16.04 LTS I updated my system a few days ago and cannot access to internet anymore using my Ethernet cable (nor with wifi, but it never worked).I have Windows on the same computer, which still recognizes the cable and allows internet connection.ifconfig only shows \"lo\" local lookback element, without any other paragraph. I have reset the etc/resolve.conf file, restarted network manager, etc. with no success.
