STANDARD: This is Chaz speaking. Sorry, but we are not home. Our present location seems to be only halfway to Irth. Remain at your posts and stand by. That is all.
ROBY: Chaz, I've got something here on my security alert. A high priority from the computer...
STANDARD: Let's hear it.
ROBY: Computer, you have signalled a priority three message. What is the message?
COMPUTER: I have interrupted the course of the voyage.
ROBY: What? <u>Why</u>?
COMPUTER: I am programmed to do so if certain conditions arise.
STANDARD: Computer, this is Captain Standard. What conditions are you talking about?
COMPUTER: I have intercepted a transmission of unknown origin.
STANDARD: A transmission?
COMPUTER: A voice transmission.
