Being taxed on tuition waiver
Hey folks.

Is anyone else being taxed on their tuition waiver? I get 1000 a month and 300 of that goes to taxes because they also tax the tuition waiver. So we get taxed like we’re making 2000 instead of 1000. They spread it out so it doesn’t hit all at once, but it’s insane. I remember seeing this in the news that they were considering taxing waivers like income and that it didn’t pass, so I was pretty upset when my first paycheck came in and it was far less than what I budgeted for. 300 dollars coming out of 1000 is a big deal for me and I didn’t know to prepare for it.
