KIMBERLY: Let's meet tonight, okay?
BUFFY: Where?
KIMBERLY: Cafe Blase.
NICOLE: Cool. We can figure decorations and stuff.
BUFFY: Cassandra, you gotta come, too.
CASSANDRA: Can't. History report. The Normans and the Saxons.
BUFFY: Bogutude. Blow it off.
CASSANDRA: I really can't. Besides, it's pretty interesting.
BUFFY: You're weird and I'm afraid of you. Seriously, Cassandra, there's a lot cooler things you could be doing than your homework.
CASSANDRA: Like what?
BUFFY: Like my homework.
KIMBERLY: I don't see why we have to invite everyone.
BUFFY: Kimberly, it's the senior dance.
NICOLE: If we don't invite all the seniors we can't use the school funds, you know that.
KIMBERLY: Can't they make exceptions? Maryanne Heinel? She's such a scud. Can't we have a Maryanne clause?
NICOLE: Well, look who's here.
