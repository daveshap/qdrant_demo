MARCEL: Hanging is nice. Never goes out of style. What about hare-kare - a taste of the Orient? But no! You're in Paris! Try the Guillotine! There's one in the Louvre!
AMY: I'd use pills. They're painless.
MARCEL: Oh give me a break! He could use pills back in America! Why not get a little culture?
ANDY: Look, I didn't mean to hurt anybody... God, I didn't mean to... to...
AMY: Rip my face off? Hey, we all make mistakes. Hell, I didn't mean to sleep with you on the first night, especially without a condom. But I did, and now I'm paying the price.
MARCEL: Let's face it. It's a, how do you say... mother-fucker. But we're all in it together. That's why we're trying to help you.
AMY: Exactly.
MARCEL: Merde! Just missed!
AMY: Uhh! Would you die already!
ANDY: Fuck you! If I'm gonna kill myself I'll do it when I'm good and ready! You can go to hell!
MARCEL: No we can't. That's the problem. God knows it would beat hanging around with you!
ANDY: Hey, you can't kick me! You're an apparition!
AMY: What, all of a sudden you got a degree in supernatural law?
