HARRY: Wow, a treasure map! What's the treasure?
MRS. DUNNE: It could be anything. You're going to discover a whole new world when you get to school.
HARRY: Wow just like Marco Polo.
MRS. DUNNE: I don't follow.
HARRY: You know Mom, like in the pool.
MRS. DUNNE: You're going to be just fine, HARRY.
HARRY: I know I am, Mom.
MRS. DUNNE: Here's your lunch. And an apple and banana for extra energy.
HARRY: Maybe the treasure's a chest full of apples and bananas!
