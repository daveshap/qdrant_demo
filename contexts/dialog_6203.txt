ALEX: Excuse me, missus, can you please help? There's been a terrible accident. Can I please use your telephone for an ambulance?
CATLADY: I'm frightfully sorry. There is a telephone in the Public House about a mile down the road. I suggest you use that.
ALEX: But, missus, this is an emergency. It's a matter of life and death. Me friend's lying in the middle of the road bleeding to death.
CATLADY: I... I'm very sorry, but I never open. I'm very sorry but I never open the door to strangers after dark.
ALEX: Very well, madam. I suppose you can't be blamed for being suspicious with so many scoundrels and rouges of the night about. Alex walks away from door, then ducks into the bushes where the others are hiding. They put on their maskies and follow Alex round to the rear of the house.
