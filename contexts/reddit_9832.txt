Career options for someone with RA/Res Life experience?
Graduated college this year and was looking to break into Residence Life as a profession. 10-12 interviews later and have not been extended any offers.

Since the hiring season for this type of position is coming to a close, does anyone here know of any sorts of jobs I could be looking into that would value my RA background?
