Honest Question; What IT Skill Pays Best?
I’m no spring chicken, humor me please. I’m educated (bachelors in psych, masters in counseling) and published in refereed journals. I make a whopping $36k after nearly 20 years in the field. At 52, I want to finally get into IT. God knows I couldn’t do worse, right? If you IT people could pick one or two core skills in IT (programming languages), which would you think would be lucrative to be proficient in?
