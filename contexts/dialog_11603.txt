KAGGS: When I said you being the best salesman here didn't say much, I meant for us. I know your record with Sarber and Webb, and I'd say you're a top-flight man, but you've had no incentive. No one walking on your heels. Just a lot of half asses, so the tendency's been not to stretch yourself. I'm bouncing the slobs, incidentally.
ROY: So I heard.
KAGGS: Makes no difference to me if they're only on commission. If they don't make good money, they're not giving us good representation, and we can't afford to have them around. Ever supervise salesmen?
ROY: Just myself.
KAGGS: That's right, you've had to supervise yourself. This place needs a sales manager. Somebody who's proved he's a salesman and can handle other salesmen. He'd have a lot of deadwood to clear out, new men to hire. What do you think?
ROY: Sounds like a good Idea.
KAGGS: I don't know offhand what your best year's been, we can look it up. The idea is, we'll top it by fifteen percent.
ROY: What? Me?
KAGGS: That's just the first year. If you aren't worth a lot more than that the second year, I'll kick you out. What do you say?
ROY: Well, uh... No.
KAGGS: No?
ROY: I can't take that job! I mean, I mean, I can't take it right away. I'm still recuperating, I just dropped in to say hello, see everybody --
KAGGS: I didn't realize. Yeah, you do look a little pale. How soon will you be ready? A week?
ROY: But you need a man right now. It wouldn't be fair to you to --
KAGGS: I take care of the being-fair-to-me department. Things've gone to hell this long, they can go a little longer.
ROY: Well...
KAGGS: See you in a week, Roy. I can call you Roy?
ROY: Oh, sure. Fine.
KAGGS: And I'm Perk. Short for Percy, I'm afraid.
ROY: Perk.
