Tls certificate correspondence I am not really good in tls details, just know some basics.So there are couple of questions about it:Is there a way to decipher tls in wireshark if the cipher method is diffie hellman? I know that using web browser it is easy as I have session key there. But in general case how I can extract session keys if I just have tls over bare tcp? If I have multiple clients who connect to the server, how does the server distinguish between different certificates and chooses the right one to decipher the message?
