DANTE: Who eats cock?
RANDAL: Bunch of savages in this town. Hey, Caitlin's in the back. You might want to see if she's okay; she's been back there a long time.
DANTE: There's no lights back there.
RANDAL: I told her that. She said she didn't need any. Why don't you join her, man. Make a little bathroom bam-bam.
DANTE: I love your sexy talk. It's so... kindergarten: Poo-poo; wee-wee.
RANDAL: Fuck you.
CAITLIN: How'd you get here so fast?
DANTE: I left like an hour ago.
CAITLIN: Do you always talk weird after you violate women?
RANDAL: Maybe the Asian design major slipped her some opium?
DANTE: Could be.
CAITLIN: Promise me it'll always be like that.
DANTE: Like what?
CAITLIN: When you just lie perfectly still and let me do everything.
DANTE: Um... okay.
RANDAL: Am I missing something here?
CAITLIN: I went back there, and Dante was already waiting for me.
RANDAL: He was?
CAITLIN: It was so cool. He didn't say a word. He was just... ready, you know? And we didn't kiss or talk or anything. He just sat there and let me do all the work.
RANDAL: You dog! I didn't see you go back there.
CAITLIN: And the fact that there weren't any lights made it so... God! That was so great!
DANTE: It wasn't me.
CAITLIN: Yeah, right. Who was it: Randal?
DANTE: Was it you?
RANDAL: I was here the whole time.
CAITLIN: You two better quit it.
DANTE: I'm serious.
CAITLIN: We didn't just have sex in the bathroom?
DANTE: No.
CAITLIN: Stop this. This isn't funny.
DANTE: I'm not kidding. I just got back from outside.
CAITLIN: This isn't fucking funny, Dante!
DANTE: I'm not fooling around! Who went back there?
RANDAL: Nobody! I swear!
CAITLIN: I feel nauseous.
DANTE: Are you sure somebody was back there?
CAITLIN: I didn't just fuck myself! Jesus, I'm going to be sick!
RANDAL: You just fucked a total stranger?
DANTE: Shut the fuck up!
CAITLIN: I can't believe this! I feel faint...
DANTE: Call the police.
RANDAL: Why?
CAITLIN: No, don't!
DANTE: There's a strange man in our bathroom, and he just raped Caitlin!
CAITLIN: Oh God...
RANDAL: She said she did all the work.
DANTE: WOULD YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP? WHO THE FUCK IS IN THE BATHROOM?
