How to get the UT1 directly? or How to get the UT1-UTC I have a question to consult you. Even though I know the relationship between time scales like UT1, UTC, TAI, and TT, I do not know which one is the key point for the computation. That is, from which parameter I can derive others.For example, if I wanna compute UT1, I must know UT1-UTC. But how to derive UT1-UTC normally? Actually, I know there is some place to distribute the table for UT1-UTC. But compared to that, I prefer to know how to derive that.In my opinion, all the key point maybe the TAI. We can derive the TAI-UT1 by astronomical observation and then compute other time scales with the relationship formula. Am I right? I hope for the right and professional answer.
