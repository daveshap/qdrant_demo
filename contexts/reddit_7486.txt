Group project...
So I’m almost finished with my second semester of grad school! I have three things left, one for each class. I have an acquaintance in two of my three classes and I know she is having a hard time keeping up. I have been helping her out with a few assignments that we have had thus far. Really just making sure she understands the concepts, and is able to get everything done. Well, she and I, along with two other people have been assigned to the same group for a final project. The project is truly a gift from the professor. He has assigned each group several of the review questions from the qualifying exam review for the subject. His plan is to check all the answers for accuracy and then compile all the answers for the class. Additionally, this project replaces our final exam. Another group member and I are planning to make sure we have answers for all the questions just in case our other two members flake. 

My question is if the others don’t participate, should we let them coast on our work or throw the under the bus. As part of the assignment we are asked to talk about everyone’s contribution.
