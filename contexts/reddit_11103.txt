In case any of you youngsters are vaping/smoking please listen to me, an 18 yr old nicotine addict.
I’ve started vaping when I was 15, took up smoking when I was 16. I smoked for two years (up to a pack a day just after turning 18, the legal smoking age in my country) then switched to vaping. And guess what? I fucking regret it. It was the worst decision I’ve ever made. I need to take a hit or two off my vape every 2 hours or else I get angry and anxious at everything. It’s gotten so bad that I need to plan my day considering my addiction. The windshield in my car is always dirty because of vaping. Train/plane rides are awful, holidays with family are awful because I can’t get my fix as often as I’d like to. Please don’t start taking nicotine, it’s not fucking worth it. Think before doing it. I regret it, nicotine changed my life 180 degrees. I tried nicotine gum, cytosine, cold turkey and it just doesn’t work. Please learn from my mistakes guys and gals, I screwed up my life because is wanted to be “cool”. It’s almost impossible to quit once you start, I’m probably in this shit until the end of my life.
