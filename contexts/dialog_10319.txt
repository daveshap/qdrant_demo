NICKY: aybe we ought to postpone the opening.
SIDNEY: Joanna loves this play. She has sunk tons of money. She is completely Ncommitted.
NICKY: appreciate that, Sidney. But our leading man can't remember his lines. And his understudy can't carry the play.
SIDNEY: I had lunch with Joanna. She said she told you about Peter. You weren't concerned, she said.
NICKY: hat was this morning.
SIDNEY: So what happened since? You're worried about this kid who writes these reviews?
NICKY: 'm not worried about this kid.
SIDNEY: Well I am. Worried sick. Everybody quotes Steven Schwimmer. He's here to announce the death of civilization. He kills a play every time he farts.
NICKY: Postpone. We have every right.
SIDNEY: Too late. All the elements are in place. Delay the opening and we lose the theater.
NICKY: I've had three straight washouts, Sidney.
SIDNEY: You're dangling from the last letter of your last name.
NICKY: Sidney remains optimistic.
PETER: Sidney.
NICKY: Sidney Fabrikant. Our producer.
PETER: I was educated by nuns.
NICKY: Yes.
PETER: I have excellent long-term memory.
NICKY: Yes.
PETER: I kissed Shirley Felder on the teeth.
NICKY: Yes, Peter.
PETER: But my parasite is consuming all the new memories. Eating my lines.
NICKY: You have to see the words. Try to build a mental picture of the script. Imagine your lines high- lighted with a felt tip pen.
PETER: What color?
NICKY: What was your favorite color crayon, growing up?
PETER: Burnt sienna.
NICKY: Mine was cobalt blue.
PETER: This is your history, isn't it? Nicky? All around us. And my parasite is consuming it.
NICKY: Yes.
PETER: I kissed her while she was laughing.
NICKY: Yes.
PETER: I can see her face so clearly. Dear God. My heart was flying out of my chest with love.
