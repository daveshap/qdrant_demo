ANTHONY: This is Inez. Carmen. Anita.
DIGNAN: Hi.
ANTHONY: Inez, this is --
DIGNAN: Jerry. And this is my associate Cornelius.
DIGNAN: May I have a word with you, please?
ANTHONY: Sure.
DIGNAN: What the fuck is going on here?
ANTHONY: What. What's the matter?
DIGNAN: Anthony, we're on the run from the law here. Did you tell these people your real name?
ANTHONY: No. I didn't. Dignan, they don't speak English.
DIGNAN: They don't?
ANTHONY: No. Not really. Inez speaks a little.
DIGNAN: Which one was that?
ANTHONY: On the left.
ANTHONY: She's from Cuba.
DIGNAN: No kidding.
BOB: Dignan.
DIGNAN: Anthony. Bad news.
ANTHONY: How long are they going to hold him?
BOB: I don't know. I don't know anything. Except Phil says they got him. And he's in jail.
DIGNAN: He needs to hire an attorney.
ANTHONY: No, no. Look. OK. Let's stay here until we find out what's going on.
BOB: Anthony, I --
ANTHONY: And if Future Man doesn't get let out of jail in 48 hours, then we go back. All right?
DIGNAN: Now that makes sense. We'll hang out for a couple of days. Get a little R&R. Make sure Future Man's OK and then get back on the road.
ANTHONY: As long as he gets out OK.
DIGNAN: Obviously. That's a given.
ANTHONY: Bob?
BOB: What?
ANTHONY: Is that OK?
