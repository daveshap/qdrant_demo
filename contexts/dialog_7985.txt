SHARI: I feel like a criminal or, like we're cheating on someone.
ED: Just... just relax. Okay? We won't do anything. We'11 just sit here for a while.
SHARI: Okay.
ED: Come on...
ED: I need to talk.
SHARI: Are you all right?
ED: She lied to me. I mean all my life, she's telling me one story and then... it turns out to be a completely different story. Come to me at some point -- tell me the truth. No. Not in my house. The truth is a stranger. And this is why Ray and Marcia are the way they are. Marcia gets involved with all these losers and sees no problem with herself - How do they find me" she says. Ray cheats on you and then blames me for it. I'm the only one in the family who takes any responsibility for himself... Oh
SHARI: Yeah... I saw that girl come on to you at the TV show.
ED: Oh that was... no, I ... she just kind of trapped me into giving her a ride. It's you. I want you.
SHARI: ...yeah?
