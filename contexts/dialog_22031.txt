RUDY: Ashley, Jesus --
ASHLEY: Can't survive on our bodies alone, Nick. Hurry up!
RUDY: Ash... didn't you write me that you don't eat chocolate?
ASHLEY: Yeah, well you wrote me you were six- foot-four, baby. So don't talk to me about little white lies.
ASHLEY: You need a COAT!
RUDY: Ash, you've gotten me enough --
ASHLEY: No boyfriend of mine is going to walk around in negative-five degree wind chill without a goddamn good- looking coat!
RUDY: Baby, c'mon, all this stuff... I haven't gotten you anything --
ASHLEY: You got out, Nick. You're here. You're my Christmas.
