I can't wait for college.
I'm so excited.  I would love to go to any college I'm applying to, including my safeties, and I just have so much hope for the future.  I love applying to college because I know I'll be moving on to a really amazing chapter of my life, even if I go to community college. I know that whatever happens I'm going to be so genuinely happy with life in college.  :)
