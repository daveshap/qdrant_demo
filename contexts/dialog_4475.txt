BOB: What happened?
DIGNAN: Shhh. Slow down, Bob. Drive natural.
BOB: This is natural.
DIGNAN: That's good. Keep it at forty.
BOB: Did we get it?
DIGNAN: Be cool, Bob. Be cool. Make that light.
ANTHONY: Holy shit.
DIGNAN: We got it. We got it.
BOB: How much is there?
DIGNAN: Don't count it.
BOB: Was Dignan screaming like, Get me a bag!
DIGNAN: No. I was calm.
ANTHONY: What about what that guy said?
DIGNAN: Oh, shit. That was scary. In the middle of the robbery. The manager looks at me. Right in the eye. And goes, I'm going to remember you.
BOB: Are you serious?
ANTHONY: Yeah. He said that.
DIGNAN: I swear to God. In a very quiet voice.
ANTHONY: Like he meant it.
DIGNAN: Yeah.
ANTHONY: Like he would find Dignan. One day.
DIGNAN: Like I'm going to hunt you down and kill you.
BOB: You really think he'll remember you?
DIGNAN: No. All he'll remember is a guy with a piece of tape on his nose.
BOB: See you.
ANTHONY: See you, Bob.
