MAROON: Valiant! You surprised me.
VALIANT: That was the idea.
VALIANT: You're not too good at this, are you, R.K.?
MAROON: No... I'm not. I'm a cartoon maker, not a murderer.
VALIANT: Well, everybody needs a hobby.
MAROON: No, you gotta understand, Valiant, I had nothin' to do with Acme gettin' killed. I just wanted to sell my studio. But they wouldn't buy my property unless Acme would sell his. And he wouldn't. So I was gonna blackmail Acme with pictures of him and the rabbit's wife.
