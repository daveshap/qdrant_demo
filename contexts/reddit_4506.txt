I fucking hate high school
I don’t belong here. I’m stuck in this shitty school where everyone is a racist asshole and the teachers are scrambling to keep it together. And I just have to sit and watch. I wanted that perfect HS experience but my fucking “friends” threw me in the dirt. Everyday I feel more alone and isolated. I just want to lie down and cry at the end of each day. People tell me college will be better but I don’t know for sure anymore
