Shared “confidential” information with VP of a department at my job for him to present at a company meeting. Am I overthinking?
So, to make a long story short; the owner/CEO of our small company, sent me
PowerPoint slides that they told me the are confidential and that I shouldn’t share them with anyone. I just started at the company, and I’m in an entry level position. 

A few weeks ago, things were very hectic at work and we got a last minute call from the CEO to change the meeting rooms for a planned meeting they would would be presenting at, using the PowerPoint slides they sent me. So we just needed to get the info on the screen for the client that was coming in as quickly as possible. The VP of a department at our organisation asked if I could send him the slides to add to the deck, which he (the VP) would also be presenting from his laptop (so I had to send the slides to him). 

Does sharing the slides with the VP, considering that he 1) would be presenting them from his laptop and everyone knew and saw this, 2) wanted to make edits to it and 3) requested me to send them and is in a much higher level position, put me in the wrong since they’re “confidential”? 

Am I in the clear or just overthinking? When the CEO mentioned not giving the slides to anyone, I suppose they meant external customers/vendors; am I correct? I have a feeling it’s ok and I’m just overthinking, just want to make sure.
