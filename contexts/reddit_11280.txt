Stimulus checks for everyone but college students... (and a few other groups of people... I know I'm not the only one)?
I lost both my jobs due to current events. I am stressed beyond belief about paying rent. When I found out about the stimulus checks, I felt so relieved, but my mom just told me today that I am not getting one since I didn't claim as a dependent in 2018. I am stressed, depressed, and pissed. I know I am not the only one out there who is pissed about that stupid "you're a college student, so your parents must pay for everything" bullshit. Okay, rant over. Sorry if I'm a pussy.
