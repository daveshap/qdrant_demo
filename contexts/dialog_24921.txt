BARNES: You talk to any reporters? Any press?
NORMAN: Press? No, I haven't.
BARNES: Good. Security's been our biggest worry. Now that you're here we can shut this thing down tight.
NORMAN: From what? What's with all the security?
BARNES: Well, we don't have all the facts yet.
BARNES: We're moving fast considering the storm.
NORMAN: Storm? What storm?
BARNES: A cyclone's on it's way in. I thought they would have told you on the phone.
NORMAN: They didn't tell me anything.
