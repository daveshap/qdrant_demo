CHRIS: Do you think anyone will really come here?
DOUG: Well, I think I_ve got a handle on the Czech pysche and I reckon this kind of joint will make _em reminisce about the sixties. Plus we should get a few stray expat_s looking for Kafka.
CHRIS: Fancy some lunch after we_re through with this Meccano shit?
DOUG: Sure, I think it_s your turn to buy too.
DOUG: We'd better get some booze in for tonight.
CHRIS: You should have said it was Bring-A-Bottle.
DOUG: No, I figure once they see the place and we get'em a little drunk, they'll all want to help. We should have that floor done in a day or so.
DOUG: Here, let's both put in two hundred crowns. That should get nine or ten bottles of wine.
CHRIS: No beer?
DOUG: Not on the opening night, wouldn't look right.
DOUG: You get the wine and I'll go see if I can rustle up some plastic cups.
CHRIS: Why don't we go together?
DOUG: No, it could take me hours. You know what it's like trying to find things in this town, not to mention disposable stuff - I wouldn't think they've ever heard of them.
CHRIS: Red or white?
DOUG: Both, see you later.
