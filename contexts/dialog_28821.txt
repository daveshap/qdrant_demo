WINTERS: What's this?
REILLY: Report on the case so far.
WINTERS: You know after a shooting I would normally take your badge and weapon, but Glass called in already and confirmed it was clean.
REILLY: Yes, sir.
WINTERS: But from now on, any leads on this case go to Pluchinsky. He's primary investigator and you are unofficially assigned to the Bomb Squad... you and your new friends are not to be playing detective any more. Got it?
