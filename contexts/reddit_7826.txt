What is the best grad school to go to?
I am not in college right now. Iâ€™ll be doing my second semester at CC over the summer and I am just curious.

Do people typically consider Ivy league and super selective schools for grad school even if they are not the usual person to be so high up? It is not that going to those schools make a person better than going to other grad schools.

What is your first choice of grad school for science, specifically physics or more preferably astrophysics?

What is something informative and interesting about grad school and what is you favorite part about it?

Thank you :)

update: I am considering graduate school at either a very selective school like UC Berkeley or Yale. is it so strange for someone to go from being a felon to a Yale graduate?
