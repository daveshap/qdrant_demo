I have a situation??
Long story short, I really like this guy that goes to another school. I’m not allowed to talk to him but have been and we’ve decided that it’s best to just stay friends for right now. I’m not exactly sure how I’m supposed to deal with this?? Everything just feels right with him but my parents disapprove so I’m not sure what I’m going to do. Can anyone help or give advice?
