TALLEY: Can you identify this man?
DILL: That would be Mars Krupchek. Jesus, he works for me, too.
TALLEY: Have Louise run the name 'Mars Krupchek' through DMV and NCIC. Tell her to list the tattoo as an identifier.
TALLEY: Is Krupchek an aggressive guy? Hot- tempered? Anything like that?
DILL: Keeps to himself, more like.
TALLEY: You have his address?
DILL: Pretty sure I do. Yeah, here we go --
TALLEY: Call the Palmdale City Attorney for a telephonic search warrant. When you get the warrant, have Mikkelson and Dreyer search his house.
ANDERS: Yes, sir.
