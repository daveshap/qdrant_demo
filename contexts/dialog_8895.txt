JACK: In the old days, every man had a shaving mug that he kept at the barber shop. Then, whenever he wanted a shave, held go down to the barber shop and there would be his mug, waiting for him.
NINA: Is that what you used to do?
JACK: My days are not the old days, genius.
NINA: What are they?
JACK: The recent past.
NINA: Oh. Bigfoot gets his out of a can.
JACK: How do you know?
NINA: I saw his stuff in the bathroom.
JACK: Oh?
NINA: I guess it's getting serious.
JACK: Maybe he'll ask your ma to marry him.
NINA: I hope not. He's already busted the springs in two chairs. Hey, what's this?
JACK: Ivory.
NINA: Looks old.
JACK: Older than me.
NINA: Wow.
JACK: Hey, what do you want to do? Grow a beard?
NINA: Why not?
JACK: Well, let's get your first prom under the belt, okay?
NINA: What's a prom?
JACK: Ever go to church?
