How to Work for a Major Domestic/International Airline
Hello all,

&#x200B;

Working in the aviation industry, in particular cabin crew, has been a dream of mine ever since I could remember. I think I'm definitely an outlier when I say I actually like working in customer service positions and have an innate nature for helping people. Providing exceptional customer service is very important to me and I've been recognized at my current and past positions for my ability to deliver such customer service while thinking on my feet.

I feel very stuck (and have been for years before COVID-19 hit) and honestly sad. I've applied for SO many cabin crew positions only to have them turn me down yet I see people with no experience land a cabin crew position for a major U.S. carrier. I'm only 23 years old, have my bachelors degree, have experience working in the travel industry (3rd party booking website, cringy, I know).

My question is: despite always applying, is this industry just not meant for me? I hate my current job but I'm thankful I have a job. It's call center work, and being verbally abused/dehumanized on a daily basis has made my life hell. I have no friends anymore because all I do is work. I've turned to substance abuse via prescription painkillers.  I experience anhedonia 24/7. How do I escape? I wish I could quit or something right now, but I need the money because I recently filed for bankruptcy.

TLDR; My life is a mess and I've tried applying to my dream job on multiple occasions to no success. I hate my job and it's taken a toll on my mental and physical health. What do I do?
