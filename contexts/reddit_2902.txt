I love my job but want extra job security. What degree is generic enough to open doors but specific enough to be looked as beneficial?
Sorry the title is painful. Right now I’m an analyst for a large insurance company. I work remotely and absolutely love the company and the job. However, I don’t feel all that secure in my job as you just never know what could happen. (Lay offs- and since I’m remote it’d be difficult to apply for a replacement role) 

My experience is great but I don’t have a degree which would stop be from being considered.

Anyways, I’m looking into going back to school. I’d love to stay within the company should something happen. The one degree that seems to fit where I’d like to be is communications. I love creating guides/tutorials/training materials and I feel like that degree fits fairly while. Another option is something generic towards business. 

I read somewhere that communication degrees are looked down upon because they’re one of the easier degrees to get. Is this true?

Also- even if I wouldn’t end up staying with the company.. how do other companies view degrees. Which ones are looked highly at and vise versa?

Edit. To add- I don’t want to stay in analytics. Ideally I’d like to work in a more creative field such as project management or design.
