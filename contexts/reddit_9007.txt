What are other countries doing in response to the recent Helsinki Summit between Trump and Putin?
I'm curious if any country has done anything policy related based on the Helsinki Summit, in particular [this press conference](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/16/world/europe/russia-trump-putin-news-conference-transcript.html). [Both parties have been critical of Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/16/us/politics/republicans-trump-putin.html) after the summit. I'm wondering how the legislative bodies of other countries have reacted, whether passing resolutions that don't really do anything, or passing laws that actually do something.
