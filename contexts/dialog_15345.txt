BREE: Ah, Schmendrick -- what's the scam?
KLUTE: Those were police laboratory people, they've been over the apartment.
BREE: Oh zippidy-doo, they'll find my fingerprints. Can I go in? I need some stuff.
KLUTE: Where'd you spend last night?
BREE: With Trina.
KLUTE: I called Trina.
BREE: Maybe I wasn't there when you called.
KLUTE: Bree, what's actually happened? It wasn't that bad.
BREE: How do you know how bad it was?
KLUTE: Why couldn't you stay here with me?
BREE: Because I didn't want to be touched! I didn't think you'd get that!
