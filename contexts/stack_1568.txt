Do full charges and deep discharges wear the battery because of terminal voltage? A mobile phone battery charged to indicated 100%, which is not being charged at the moment, might have the same terminal voltage as if it is being charged at 2A while being at an indicated capacity of 70%.A deep discharge (terminal voltage below 2.5V) is said to cause a harmful chemical reaction in a lithium-ion battery.If a battery is shorted out in a way the voltage drops below 2.5V, does that have the same harmful effect?And does a battery wear out because of terminal voltage or capacity if fully charged?If it is because of terminal voltage, fast charging stresses the battery in the same way an ordinary full charge does.
