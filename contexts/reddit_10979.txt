When you can't kill yourself soo you live as a soulless person
I'm the youngest in the family. 17. My whole  childhood  has been devastating. Child abuse and mental manipulation 

When i was 4 i was sexualy assaulted by a babysitter  and never talked about it. 

When i cried as a child they'd tell me to man up or that men don't cry. and from there i never got a tear out. no matter how much of a mental wreck i was. i always absorbed the damage and kept it inside.  The weight  is heavy on my chest. 

I always was enslaved by my manipulative brother. ont day when he stole something  that i loved i chocked the shit out of him. they forced me to apologize.  And another time where he false accused me of something. i was mad i tried to stab the shit out of him. i got sent to my room. i cried and when my dad tried talking to me  he said that we don't  need your problems too
I've gone out and thought of suicide

Then i stopped myself  because  the only person i cared about (my mother) would be sad. I may be suicidal but I'm  a man of dedication  and a strong mentality and
  i promised that no harm should be donne to her

Now I'm  living like this. Can't feel anything. Can't trust anyone. or open to any guy.
