JOE: A regular all-American guy?
ANDREW: I suppose you could say that.
JOE: Except... you were gay?
ANDREW: I still am.
JOE: In the years you worked at Wyant Wheeler, did you ever tell Charles Wheeler you were gay?
ANDREW: No. I didn't.
JOE: Can you explain <u>why</u> you didn't?
ANDREW: You don't bring your personal life into a law firm. You're not supposed to <u>have</u> a personal life, really. Anyway, I did plan to tell Charles, eventually. But then, this thing happened at the tennis club...
WHEELER: Longstreet's interested in the Harrisburg deal.
ANDREW: I'm seeing him this afternoon.
