ARTHUR: But I have to leave tomorrow. The forests are thick with rebels, invaders plunder our shores...
GUENEVERE: --And damsels in besieged castles are waiting to be rescued?
ARTHUR: I didn't know Leondegrance had a daughter.
GUENEVERE: Well, then, I shall tell you which knights have maiden daughters, so you can avoid their castles.
GUENEVERE: No, I think it's better if you just stay here to heal. At least a week.
ARTHUR: I'm going.
GUENEVERE: Quiet, or I'll sew up your mouth too.
