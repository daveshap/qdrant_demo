MAC: Jesus Christ.
SALLY: Well...wow...
CLAIR: Mac? Oh there you are. What are you doing, honey? No more work. Don't you feel breezy.
MAC: I'm in mourning.
CLAIR: You can cut around it, whatever it is. You always do.
MAC: Not this time.
CLAIR: It's always not this time. If you can do it around me, you can do it around anyone.
MAC: You don't have any clothes on.
CLAIR: How nice for everybody. Come swimming. The water's glorious. You'll fix it. You'll come up with one of your brilliant ideas.
MAC: Or I won't. I can't help her. I'm out of my depth.
CLAIR: Things always look much worse in the morning.
MAC: I don't know how to make her funny.
CLAIR: You're coming swimming in the pool, and in a few minutes you won't even remember what it's about. You won't care who's in your damn movie.
MAC: What what's about?
CLAIR: I...wait, what are you talking about?
JOE: Are you okay?
MONICA: I don't think so. I feel. I feel a bit funny.
JOE: Let's go for a walk.
MONICA: I've never done this before.
JOE: Oh? It's easy. You just put one foot in front of the other... That's a good girl.
MONICA: I'm a little in the puke zone.
JOE: Here, drink this. Drink lots of water. Hold on to this. Take deep breaths. Nice and slow. Would you like a lolly?
MONICA: What am I, five?
JOE: You're never too old for a lolly. I'm having one.
MONICA: Okay.
JOE: Lemon or raspberry?
MONICA: Lemon.
JOE: Lemon it is.
MONICA: Ryan's really angry with me.
JOE: I think he's really angry with me too.
MONICA: It's really not the same thing. He was really nicer when he drank.
JOE: I'm sorry.
MONICA: Eight years, though. That's quite an accomplishment.
JOE: That's a lot of those.
MONICA: Medallions.
JOE: A lot of cakes.
MONICA: Yes.
JOE: And he doesn't smoke?
MONICA: He has to find non-smoker's meetings that used to be almost impossible, you know? It's gotten much better.
JOE: How long have you been married?
MONICA: Nine...nine, yes? Nine years, just about.
JOE: You must have been a baby.
MONICA: Oh yes. Nineteen...just. I'm cold.
JOE: Come here.
MONICA: That's very nice.
JOE: I like you.
MONICA: I'm so glad. You know, I recognize that passage in your book. The bit about us running into each other in the movie theatre.
JOE: Sorry?
MONICA: I know you changed it to a bookstore. And the color of my hair. But the moment was exactly the same. The same, you know, dynamic. And almost verbatim, wasn't it?
JOE: Yeah, it was. For a writer nothing's sacred. No, nothing at all.
MONICA: I think it's great that I made an impression at all, you know.
