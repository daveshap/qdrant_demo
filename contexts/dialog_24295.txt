BILL: Don't worry. The lurker ain't around. I checked.
STARLA: That's not funny.
BILL: Sorry.
STARLA: Whatcha' doin'?
BILL: Tryin' to get a buzz on. But I'm too buff. Too much muscle mass.
BILL: What you up to?
STARLA: Just checking out the lights.
BILL: Pretty, ain't they?
STARLA: I don't know. I've seen them so many times before. I guess any spot gets boring after awhile.
BILL: Well that's only if you're in the wrong spot.
BILL: There's a place over there on the bluffs. When the fog is just right, like tonight, the lights of Main look like a kaleidoscope.
STARLA: Oh, yeah?
BILL: Mm hm. But only a few folks know how to get there. Wally. Rollo Linkski coulda taken you, but 'course he got hit by that train. Me.
STARLA: I'll get Wally to show me sometime then.
