My (F25) experience with online dating as a hetero woman.
I'll get right to it. I've been using online dating on and off since I was 18. It's mostly been a lot of frustration. As a woman I understand that it's a lot of pressure to put on men to always expect them to make the first move, so I have always tried to get out there and make it known when I am into a guy. However, in doing so I have noticed a lot of common issues that are very likely getting in the way of people finding one another, so I thought I would make this post to hopefully help both men and women when it comes to online dating. Since I am heterosexual, I've really only seen straight men's profiles, so I'll be focusing on the issues that I see from that particular group as well as the quality of communication that I have received over the years:





1) **Profile Pictures** - Many of them are not even of the person themselves. A large majority have only one, poorly lit photo. Even more have only one picture in which they are wearing sunglasses that cover most of their facial features. Group photos that don't specify who is the profile owner. None of these options represents the person well. In my experience, I am far more likely to swipe left on a profile like this. It makes it very difficult to discern what someone looks like and determine whether you could be attracted to them or not. Whether you are confident in your looks or more on the shy side, either way, an accurate depiction of yourself will land you far more options than any of these I mentioned.





2) **Self Description** - I see far too many men's profiles that have "ask me" or just "ask" in every section. I understand the thought behind this, or what I assume to be the idea. If someone is interested enough, they will just ask, or maybe it's hard to know what to write. I get it. But remember, online dating is about marketing yourself to others. It's your job to do your best to represent yourself well and accurately to attract the kind of person you are looking for. I can say confidently that I immediately swipe left on this kind of profile no matter what the picture looks like. If you can't be bothered to fill in a little info about yourself, I'm not going to pull it out of you. That information is incredibly crucial. When someone does decide to message you, that information has already opened up a bunch of talking points and opportunity to get to know each other better. It's a super important factor to facilitate conversation. It's the combination of both pictures and personality that draws me to a guy. I personally appreciate an 'about me' section that reads like it was written honestly. It doesn't have to be perfect. It just needs to give people an idea of who you are, what you love, and what you want out of life. A profile in which someone has put in some honest effort to convey that information is so much more attractive than "ask me."





3) **Omitting certain information** - Ok guys. Let's get real. Things like height, body type, having/not having kids, having a car, certain values, occupation etc. are all very important things when determining a partner. Whether you are totally satisfied with your current answers to these questions or not, I strongly recommend that you do answer them, and answer them honestly. Here's an example. I am a plus-sized woman. If I were to put on my profile that I am anything other than that, I would be matched up with men that don't prefer women of my size. I would then be disappointed that none of my matches are interested in me, and would have wasted a lot of my own time as well as others'. Instead, I answer it honestly and say that I am, in fact, a large woman. So I am matched up with men that are open to dating someone like me, and I have far better luck with dating. Makes sense, right? No matter what you have, where you are in life, what you look like, there is someone out there for everyone. But it's going to be a lot more difficult if you are casting your net in the wrong direction. Tell us the truth about things, guys. It's well worth it.





4) **Communication** - Ok this is a huge one, and one that I don't really understand to boot. It is far too common that when I message a guy first, and I almost always do, the conversation dies off very, very quickly. I take the time to read the profile of the person I am messaging so that I can more easily add to the conversation and make it easy for them to do the same. This is where it's important to have that information available. Most times, I will receive a single word answer to an open-ended question, and no follow up. They respond when I send a message, but with very few words and no attempt to keep the conversation going, never ask questions, etc. Now one might think that they are just not very interested, except for the fact that they often ask why I stopped messaging them, seemingly unaware. It's because I am not into one-sided conversations where I have to do all of the work. It's a give and take. So guys, if this happens to you, compare your messages to the ones you are receiving. Are you asking her about herself too? Did you reference anything that was in her profile? I will admit it is different talking to someone in person than it is messaging over a website, I think it's a little more challenging and that's why conversational skills are that much more important for online dating. Learning about each other is going to be a little tedious and awkward at first, or at least it is IME until you get the usual niceties out of the way. Don't be afraid try and say a little more, it just gives us more to talk about.





5) **Read my profile** - There are a lot of reasons for this, but the biggest issue I have experienced personally is due to my status of being Child Free. I've lost count of the number of times a guy with children has contacted me, and then been surprised or angry when I say it's not going to work out. Had they paid attention to the obvious disclaimer on my profile, we could have both avoided wasting our time. This goes right along with #3. Do not omit the fact that you have kids and expect a CF person to suddenly be ok with it. You are setting yourself up to fail, and not to mention, it's a dick move.




So these are the five biggest issues I've witnessed quite a bit. If you've read up until this point I'd like to say thanks. I hope this helps everyone in their dating endeavors and hopefully lessens some of the more frustrating aspects of it. 



If there is something I left out or if you have something to add, please leave a comment. Thoughts and constructive criticism are welcome.



Edit: I'd like to add that this definitely applies to everyone, gender aside.

I would also love to add a couple of things in reference to taking good pictures. I personally use the lighting in my bathroom to take my best pictures. Make-up lights will do absolute wonders. Some residential bathrooms have them, it's the kind with several large, round bulbs usually at the top of the mirror or around the perimeter. I do my hair and put on my best outfit, then just play around with the front-facing camera on my phone. Truth be told, I will get one really good picture out of every 25 or more. It's a real pain trying to get it right but it's worth it in my opinion.
