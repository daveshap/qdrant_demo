DJ: What's wrong?
PETERS: Nothing. It's nothing.
COOPER: You been out there a long time. Trying to break my record?
SMITH: I'd rather spend the next twelve hours Outside than another five minutes in this can. This ship is bad. It watches you.
COOPER: What?
SMITH: You heard me. This ship, it's crazy: trying to go faster'n light, that's like the Tower of Babel.
COOPER: Shit, Smith, you're going Biblical on me.
SMITH: You know what happened to the Tower of Babel, don't you? It fell down.
COOPER: You're sucking too much nitrogen in your mix.
STARCK: Why Dr. Weir, I think you're in love.
WEIR: Hmmm. Claire used to tell me I loved the Event Horizon more than I loved her. I told her that wasn't true, I just knew the Event Horizon better, that's all.
STARCK: Claire is your wife?
WEIR: Yes.
STARCK: It must be hard, being so far away from her.
WEIR: Yes. I miss her. She died. Two years now.
STARCK: I'm sorry.
