MAVERICK: I always wanted to fly... ever since I first saw a jet. I wanted to fly jets, then I wanted F-14's, then I wanted to fly off carriers, then I wanted Top Gun.
CHARLIE: And now?
MAVERICK: And now I want you.
CHARLIE: You always get what you want?
MAVERICK: I don't know yet.
CHARLIE: I want it understood.
MAVERICK: Anything.
CHARLIE: No fooling on base, no signs, no comments, no talk. By anyone.
MAVERICK: Why?
CHARLIE: I'm a professional. You guys are in my line of work.
