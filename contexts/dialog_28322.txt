HEALY: Fine. Fine.
MARY: Here you go. What's that smell?
HEALY: The museum? I thought we were going out to dinner?
MARY: We will, but first I have a surprise.
HEALY: A surprise?
MARY: The architecture exhibit! My friend Tucker is going to be here. He's an architect, too. You guys will have tons to talk about.
MARY: I know he's around here someplace.
HEALY: What say we get outta here and go crush a bucket?
MARY: We just got here thirty seconds ago. Isn't this stuff great?
MARY: Is this one art deco or art nouveau?
HEALY: Deco.
MARY: Would you call that a portico or a vestibule?
HEALY: That...? Vestibule.
MARY: How about -- ?
HEALY: When you look at architecture, try not to concern yourself with the pieces -- look at the building in its totalitarianism.
