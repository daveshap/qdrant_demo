MICHELLE: How's it going? It's been a while...
MIKE: ...Six months.
MICHELLE: How are you doing?
MIKE: Fine... I guess. You?
MICHELLE: Good. I think about things.
MIKE: Yeah?
MICHELLE: Yeah.
MIKE: What kind of things?
MICHELLE: You know, us.
MIKE: I thought you met someone else.
MICHELLE: It doesn't matter. I think about you every day.
MIKE: Really?
MICHELLE: I miss you, Mike.
MIKE: Why didn't you call?
MICHELLE: I couldn't. Do you know how hard it's been not to call you? I pick up the phone every night. Whenever that commercial comes on...
MIKE: ...the Michelin commercial...
MICHELLE: ...Yeah, with the baby in the tire. One time I started to cry right in front of Pierre...
MIKE: Pierre... That's his name? Pierre? Is he French?
MICHELLE: No, he's not... Listen I don't want to talk about him. That's a whole other headache. I called because I heard you might be moving back to Queens...
