I feel like I’m out of options for a person to date
So I’m 14M coming up on 15 and I’ve been in a couple relationships already. I feel kinda stupid saying it but there’s a certain type of girl that I like. It’s hard to explain what it is that makes a girl attractive to me but I can tell if they have that characteristic or not by talking to them. And it’s really hard to find someone like that. Everyone at my school is wrapped up in fake drama that they all keep going in circles with, and they all look for these fairy tale ride off into the sunset kind of relationships, and that’s just not real. I’m thinking of just waiting until I’m older but I don’t know if I should just count myself out like that. Sorry for the long post but thanks for reading.
