Low-pass Filter with zero drift amplifier Can an auto-zero or chopper amplifier be used in a low-pass filter to remove a high frequency carrier? I am trying to design an active low-pass filter with a 1kHz cutoff and very low DC drift, offset, 1/f noise. The noise needs to be less than 20\u03bcVrms in 1kHz BW and -80dB attenuation is needed at 100kHz. I intend to use a Sallen-key 2nd order Butterworth with a single op-amp. My concern is whether I need to worry about my 100kHz carrier (that I am trying to extinguish) beating against the chopping amplifier modulator to produce more low-frequency artifacts in my 1kHz pass-band, or that higher frequency intermodulation products could alias when I digitize. Would I be better off using a passive filter and dealing with any residual aliasing of the 100kHz carrier digitally?My power supply will be \u00b15V and the output will drive a single ended \u01a9\u0394 ADC.
