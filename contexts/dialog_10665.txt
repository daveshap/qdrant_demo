MURPHY: Can't you use something else?
DODGE: I might be able to find something on the ship. But it's gonna take time.
MURPHY: Do what you need to do. Just do it fast.
DODGE: Right.
DODGE: I need lag bolts, especially one inch standard. And sheet metal. Preferably steel, about a sixteenth of an inch. Aluminium, even tin'll do.
GREER: I ain't no mechanic, just so you know.
DODGE: You find anything that even looks like a compressor. I don't care what, grab it.
