VADA: I feel like before I can talk to him I have to see his face.
PHIL: How's this for a solution. We'll take a drive over to his place, you can introduce yourself....
VADA: I'd like to see his house but...I don't know if I'd have the nerve to just go up and knock on his door. I don't think I can go through with it.
PHIL: Then we'll keep driving...you'll decide.
