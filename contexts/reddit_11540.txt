I'm not sure if my reaction to someone's death is appropriate.
Hey everyone... so this might seem a bit odd, but I'll try to keep it short-ish.

Anyways, on my regular account, I am subbed to /r/gamegrumps (if you don't know, Game Grumps is a youtube channel of people who play video games and make videos of them playing.) 

A little over a week ago someone made a post on the /r/gamegrumps about how he has cancer and he was glad for all of the joy watching the show gave him. Earlier today he made a second post, mentioning that he is currently in the hospital and doctors say he won't make it past Friday. 

And that's where the problem starts... since I read that earlier today, I have been a wreck. I've been crying off and on all day whenever I think about it. I've gone through an entire box of tissues.

All because of the impending death of one person, who I've never met before, who I've never heard of before a little over a week ago, and who I've had no direct contact. I can't help but wonder if my reaction is too extreme for the circumstances, or what I should do about it. I can't really ask anyone I know because it sounds ridiculous.
