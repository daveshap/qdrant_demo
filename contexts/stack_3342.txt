What happened to the Belt of Beloth the Wise? During the siege of Dras-Leona, Eragon loses the belt after the confrontation with the priests of Helgrind. He fails at finding the belt at that time and he still couldn't find the belt when he went to check for it later.Any idea what happened to it? Was the wards around it so powerful, nobody could ever find if it was lost? Or did someone destroy the belt?
