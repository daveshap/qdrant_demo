We finally have a full pantry!
I posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/awd4ua/we_have_food/) on r/CasualConversation and was told I should crosspost here!

For the first time in a long time my wife and I have a full fridge and pantry! We were able to get so much food it was actually a challenge to fit everything in the fridge. We were able to get fresh fruits and vegetables, ingredients for meals we haven't had in a long time, and stock up on things we like to use but can't always afford. It just felt great to struggle fitting food into the fridge rather than struggling to get food to put into the fridge.
