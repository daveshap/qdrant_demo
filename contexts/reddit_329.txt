Please help, I don’t know what to do...(F/15)
Okay so for almost a week now I’ve felt the constant urge to... masturbate... I know it sounds odd, but it just happened suddenly. I masturbate to try and relieve the feeling but it doesn’t work. I’ve tried doing other things to keep my mind occupied, but it doesn’t seem to work either. It’s getting in the way of my daily life, and I’m incredibly frustrated that I’m feeling the need to masturbate all the time. I’ve been contemplating asking my mom to schedule a doctors appointment for me, or if I should wait a few more days to see if I still feel this urge. I don’t know how much longer I can wait though, it’s driving me crazy feeling like this. I don’t know what to do. I’ve done some research and it may be something called “Persistent Genital Arousal Disorder” which is where women are in a constant state of arousal and do not find relief after orgasm, and the feeling may last from days to weeks (direct description from the informational website) luckily this is treatable with medication and hormonal therapy. I’m just not sure if I should wait or ask my mom. She is a nurse so she would probably know something about it, but it’s weird and awkward talking to your mom about how you constantly feel aroused. I would greatly appreciate it if someone could give me some advice on what to do.
