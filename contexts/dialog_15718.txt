CLARICE: Chilton has killed her, hasn't he? That slimy little bastard! We were so close with Lecter - and now her last chance is gone.
CRAWFORD: Let's get some coffee and talk.
CLARICE: Are you in trouble over this, Mr. Crawford? Can Senator Martin do something to you?
CRAWFORD: I'm 53, Starling. If I found Jimmy Hoffa on national TV, I'd still have to retire in two years. It's not a consideration. But you are... You've done enough. If I keep you out of school any longer, you'll be recycled. Cost you six months, at least. I can guarantee you readmission here, but that's about it. Now's your chance, Starling. Go back to class. Leave Bill to me.
CLARICE: If you didn't want me chasing him, you shouldn't have taken me to that funeral home.
CLARICE: Lecter is still the key, I know he is. Whatever he told me about Bill is just as good now as it was before.
CRAWFORD: Or just as worthless. But I want you in Memphis, close to him. Maybe when he gets tired of toying with Senator Martin, he'll talk to you again. There's a plane waiting for you now at the airstrip.
CLARICE: I lied to Lecter. I'll need some kind of peace offering... Can I get the drawings from his cell?
CRAWFORD: Good idea. Meantime, try to get a feel for Catherine Martin. Her apartment, her friends... how he might've stalked her. I'm going to the other two clinics, Minnesota and Ohio. Now's the hardest part, Starling. Use your anger, don't let it keep you from thinking. Just keep your eyes on Catherine. We've got less than 30 hours.
CLARICE: Mr. Crawford... can those cops down there handle Dr. Lecter?
CRAWFORD: They'll use their best men. But they better be paying attention...
