ALICE: Listen schmuck, why don't you get out of here and let me go to bed!
WALTER: I didn't finish talking to you!
ALICE: Well I'm done talking to you, what do I have to do, draw you a diagram!
WALTER: I decided to make a female figure after all! I want you to pose for it.
ALICE: Well I'm touched. You're serious, aren't you?
WALTER: Yes. Fifty dollars an hour, right?
ALICE: Yeah.
