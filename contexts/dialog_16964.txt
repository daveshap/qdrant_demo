MANZANO: Hombre en fuego. Man On Fire. That's what the papers have named you.
CREASY: It's what you and Rosanna named me. Right?
MANZANO: Sit, Creasy. Everything that happens from now on does so with my permission. Really. You won't find a better carne asada in all of Mexico.
MANZANO: The last few days may represent the best police work of my life.
CREASY: What do you want?
MANZANO: The same thing as you. Except, my reach isn't as long as yours. My father was a policemen, did you know that?
CREASY: I don't know shit about you.
MANZANO: He was one of the original founders of 'Le Hermanidad' in the days when it represented good not evil.
