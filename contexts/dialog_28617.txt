THE PRESIDENT: -- I have the authority. I am the commander-in-chief of the United States, and I say when we go to war!
GENERAL TAYLOR: We are not at war, sir, not until we're at DEFCON 1.
THE PRESIDENT: General, the Joint Chiefs have just signaled our intent to escalate to the Soviets. You have signaled an escalation which I had no wish to signal, and which I did not approve.
