My boyfriend had recently self harmed, and this has triggered me
The entire time my 24yo boyfriend and I (21F) have been together, he has always suffered with depression and anxiety. He has his good periods and bad periods, and I learnt how to deal with both. He’s off anti depressants, and hasn’t been to therapy in a while. Until a few days ago, he’s only ever told me about his urges, but has never actually self harmed. Then one morning, he told me he had cut himself, and how he was sorry and was really ashamed he had done it. I was supportive towards him, let him cry, and made sure he was okay. But after I had dealt with this, the thoughts of self harm seem to have become more frequent in my head. I have dealt with recurrent self harm thoughts in the past, but I haven’t suffered with them recently. I hope that I never act on these, but if I did I fear that he would blame himself, or think that I acted out to be like him. I’m just confused.
