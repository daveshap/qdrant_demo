DR. LECTER: Your lambs are still for now, Clarice, but not forever... You'll have to earn it again and again, this blessed silence. Because it's the plight that drives you, and the plight will never end.
CLARICE: Dr. Lecter -
DR. LECTER: I have no plans to call on you, Clarice, the world being more interesting with you in it. Be sure you extend me the same courtesy.
CLARICE: You know I can't make that promise.
DR. LECTER: Goodbye, Clarice... You looked - so very lovely today, in your blue suit.
