does anyone get really scared of being yelled at?
One of the biggest fears of my life is getting scolded. I fear getting scolded more than I fear my future career. Even if I know, deep down, that the other person is nice and probably understanding, I get so nervous about it that it affects my ability to do work. I submitted something in late and I was so sure my boss was going to blow up on me that I paced around for hours at home, but he called and was very understanding. It's exhausting having to live life as a panicky mess. 

I was scolded once by a strict coach when I was 15 and it took me actual years to get over it. After that one encounter, I was so scared that I would get heart palpitations and have to be physically forced to go to practice.
