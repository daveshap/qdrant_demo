Grammaticality of 'that' relative clause in phrase beginning with possessive pronoun I would like to ask about the grammaticality of a 'that' relative clause modifying a noun phrase that begins with a possessive pronoun. Please consider these examples:<blockquote>    Please send in your technician that I can talk to.  They scrapped our project that had taken us so much effort.  </blockquote>From a somewhat prescriptive standpoint (I'm trying to quit...), I would like to ask whether this construction might require the 'that' pronoun to be replaced with the stronger alternatives, 'which' or 'who', also preceded by a comma.<blockquote>    Please send in your technician, who I can talk to.  They scrapped our project, which had taken us so much effort.  </blockquote>Alternatively, beginning the noun phrases with an indefinite article would then allow the 'that' relative clause.<blockquote>    Please send in a technician that I can talk to.  They scrapped a project that had taken us so much effort.  </blockquote>I would really appreciate knowing your views on this--particularly on the ungrammaticality I see in the first examples.Thank you very much.
