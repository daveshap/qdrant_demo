SCOTTIE: Would you like some coffee?
MADELEINE: No! No, thank you!
MADELEINE: I couldn't mail it; I didn't know your address. But I had a landmark. I remembered Coit Tower and it led me straight to you.
SCOTTIE: The first time I've been grateful for Coit Tower.
SCOTTIE: I hope we will, too.
MADELEINE: What?
SCOTTIE: Meet again, sometime.
MADELEINE: We have.
MADELEINE: Good-bye.
SCOTTIE: Good-bye.
