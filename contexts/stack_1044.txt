Problem with lock screen after suspend I'm running Ubuntu 18.10, and I've changed my login screen to lightdm (since I don't like the gdm3 screen), but whenever my laptop suspends, it'll still show the gnome lock screen to log back in. Lightdm works fine with a user lock, log out, and when the computer starts up, but there's something about the waking behavior after suspend that causes it to use the gnome screen. Does anyone know how to edit these settings?
