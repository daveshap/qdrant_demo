First date on netflix party lmfao
alright so i met this beautiful girl on bumble like 3 days ago. we talked all yesterday, then decided to have our first date on netflix party. she’s never seen breaking bad so i told her i’d watch it with her. we’ve been watching it since 11:30 pm, and it’s now 4:30 am. 

she surprisingly had fun and said wants to do this again. she also found it comedic that our first date was on netflix party and so do i, but that’s fine.

we’re in lockdown in cali so we can’t just go and see each other so this will do for now.

edit: i now officially woke up, i responded to a comment earlier and was planning on doing the rest after i completely woken up, but there’s too many now and i’m too lazy to go through them. thanks for the support though lmfao!
