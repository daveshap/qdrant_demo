PISCANO'S MOTHER: Hey! Oh!
PISCANO: Oh, sorry -
PISCANO'S MOTHER: What's the matter with you?
PISCANO: Receipts and bills and... everything's here.
PISCANO'S MOTHER: Since when do you talk like that?
PISCANO: I'm sorry.
PISCANO'S MOTHER: There's a lot of people here.
PISCANO: Nance gives me trouble and I'll tell him... screw around with those suitcases and I'll take the eyes out of his frickin' head.
PISCANO'S MOTHER: Again!
PISCANO: I didn't curse. I said 'frickin' head'.
PISCANO'S MOTHER: That's enough.
PISCANO: I'm sorry.
