LASZLO: No, Ilsa, I won't let you stay here. You must get to America. And believe me, somehow I will get out and join you.
ILSA: But, Victor, if the situation were different, if I had to stay and there were only a visa for one, would you take it?
LASZLO: Yes, I would.
ILSA: Yes, I see. When I had trouble getting out of Lille, why didn't you leave me there? And when I was sick in Marseilles and held you up for two weeks and you were in danger every minute of the time, why didn't you leave me then?
LASZLO: I meant to, but something always held me up. I love you very much, Ilsa.
