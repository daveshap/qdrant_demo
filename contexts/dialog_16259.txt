J: Hello, can I help you?
PLANK: All right, it's Plank. Is Willie there?
J: No, I'm afraid he's not. He's out at the moment.
PLANK: Well, perhaps you can help?
J: Well, perhaps I can't, Plank, if you know what I mean.
PLANK: Look, could you just open the door so I could talk without shouting?
J: I can't help you, Plank.
PLANK: I think you'll find it is in your interest.
J: Hold on. OK. Look Willie, it's Plank outside asking for you, he says it's in our interest.
