PETER: Where do you live?
SHAPELEY: Orange, New Jersey.
PETER: Got a couple of kids, huh?
SHAPELEY: Yeah. Just babies.
PETER: You love them, don't you?
SHAPELEY: Oh, gee, Mister—you wouldn't—you ain't thinkin' about—
PETER: You'll keep your trap shut, all right.
SHAPELEY: Sure—sure—I'll keep my trap shut. you can depend on me, Mister.
PETER: If you don't—Ever hear of Bugs Dooley?
SHAPELEY: No.
PETER: Nice guy. Just like you. But he made a big mistake, one day. Got kind of talkative. Know what happened? His kid was found in the bottom of the river. A rock tied around its neck. Poor Bugs! He couldn't take it. Blew his brains out.
SHAPELEY: Gee! That musta been terrible. I guess he had it coming to him though. But don't you worry about me. I don't talk. I never talk. Take my word for it. Gee, I wouldn't want anything to happen to my kids.
PETER: Okay. Just remember that. Now beat it.
SHAPELEY: Oh, thanks, thanks, Mister. I always knew you guys were kind-hearted.
PETER: Come on, scram! And stay away from that bus.
SHAPELEY: Sure. Anything you say.
ELLIE: Poor old Shapeley. You shouldn't have frightened him like that.
PETER: At the rate he started, he's probably passed two state lines by this time. The exercise is good for him.
ELLIE: Yes, I noticed he was getting a little fat lately. Ouch!
PETER: What's the matter?
ELLIE: I was never built for these moonlight strolls. Why did we have to leave the bus?
PETER: I don't trust that chatterbox.
PETER: First town we hit in the morning, you better wire your father.
ELLIE: Not as long as I'm alive.
PETER: Okay with me, if you can stand the starvation diet.
ELLIE: What do you mean—starvation?
PETER: It takes money to buy food.
ELLIE: Why, haven't you—?
PETER: Not a sou. I had some before the fainting scene.
ELLIE: You didn't give that boy all your money?
PETER: I didn't give him anything . You were the big-hearted gal. How about wiring your father now?
ELLIE: Never! I'll get to New York if I have to starve all the way.
PETER: Must be some strange power Westley has over you women. How do you expect to get there?
ELLIE: To New York?
PETER: Yeah.
ELLIE: I'm following you.
PETER: Aren't you afraid of me?
ELLIE: No.
PETER: Okay. Hang on to these.
PETER: I wish you'd stop being playful.
ELLIE: Sorry. It's the first time I've ridden piggy-back" in years."
PETER: This isn't piggy-back.""
ELLIE: Of course it is.
PETER: You're crazy.
ELLIE: remember distinctly Father taking me for a piggy-back" ride—"
PETER: And he carried you like this, I suppose.
ELLIE: Yes.
PETER: Your father didn't know beans about piggy-back" riding."
ELLIE: My uncle—Mother's brother—had four children . . . and I've seen them ride piggy-back.""
PETER: I don't think there's a piggy- back" rider in your whole family. I never knew a rich man yet who was a good "piggy-back" rider."
ELLIE: That's silly.
PETER: To be a piggy-backer" it takes complete relaxation—a warm heart—and a loving nature."
ELLIE: And rich people have none of those qualifications, I suppose.
PETER: Not a one.
ELLIE: You're prejudiced.
PETER: Show me a good piggy-back" rider and I'll show you somebody that's human. Take Abraham Lincoln
