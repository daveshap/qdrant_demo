Terrified by a massive layoff at work
I went on a three weeks vacation and returned to work on Monday only to find out that layoffs was going on. Some of my colleagues around me were receiving calls from HR and many were just whispering up and down.

28 people have gone in 2 days. Management just told us that the remaining people are safe.

I am very terrified. I have been working on starting my business but yet at the stage of leaving my job to face the business squarely as I am gradually using my salary to grow my business.

I have been shaking since Monday.
How has any of you managed layoff at work.
