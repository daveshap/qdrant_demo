Started a new job a month ago and underperforming
I am 28 and started a new job a month ago and i am really underperforming. The job is a big step up for me and i am not being given a lot of guidance. I am supposed to figure everything out on my own. I  really think i will not pass probation. I also have severe anxiety so this makes it  much more difficult at my new job 

Anyhow, what advice can you give me? I already think i will get fired. I am not really contributing anything and really scared of people getting mad at me.
