PETER: You okay?
MAYA: When's your birthday?
PETER: What?
PETER: Hang on, get it up, go on, higher.
MAYA: Your 33rd birthday. The transformation will be a perversion of Christ's rising from the dead. Townsend discovered it in one of Lareaux's books.
MAYA: It'll happen at the exact time of your birth.
PETER: That can't be right. My birthday's tomorrow.
