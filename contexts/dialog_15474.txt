TED: What?! She wants what?!
SHAUNESSY'S VOICE: She's the mother. That means she's within her legal rights.
TED: John, what if she kidnaps him.

TED: I don't know, John...I mean, to be brutally honest, I'm not so sure what kind of mental shape Joanna's in right now. Y'know she admitted she was seeing a shrink.

TED: No, but--
SHAUNESSY'S VOICE: Then you don't have a choice. Have Billy at the Seventy- Fifth Street entrance to Central Park, Saturday at ten.
