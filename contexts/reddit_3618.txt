This sub is super depressing
Every post I see is “woe is me” and it made me realize two things. 
1. There are more hopeless guys and gals out there who are going through the same struggle. 
2. After reading other hopeless posts from an outside perspective, I realized how pathetic my behavior has been. 

With that said, I think this sub really opened my eyes and made me realize that life isn’t fair. Some of us have to try harder than others. If you yourself aren’t particularly attractive but want an attractive partner, you gotta fight for him/her. It’s like anything in life. Shit doesn’t simply get handed to you. You have to earn it. 

I guess what I’m trying to say is “thank you”? Thank you for showing me how I could end up if I don’t get self-confidence, take risks and step out of my comfort zone albeit without compromising my values and principles. 

I hope others who are lonely and hopeless can eventually have the same outlook.

Edit: a user has misinterpreted the phrase “fight for him/her”. The word fight is another way of saying one needs to make the effort whether that be battling one’s own insecurities, stepping out of his or her comfort zone, etc. 
It does NOT mean chasing someone who isn’t interested in you. I’m sorry if people are misinterpreting it that way.
