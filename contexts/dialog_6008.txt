ALFREDO: Chaplin's Modern Times! Right, Toto?
SALVATORE: That's right, Modern Times.
ALFREDO: I've shown it so many times I know it by heart. The first time I showed it, in 1940, was the Sunday my first wife died. They kept it hidden from me all day so they wouldn't have to close down the movie house. I only found out that night, after the last show. Those are things you never forget... So, Toto, how are these home movies going?
SALVATORE: Yes.
ALFREDO: What is it, what is it? What's the picture?
SALVATORE: It's people in the slaughter-house killing a calf. There's blood all over the floor, like a lake. And through this lake another calf passes by on its way to die.
ALFREDO: Now what can you see?
SALVATORE: Nothing, there's nothing. It's all out of focus.
ALFREDO: Is there a woman?...Tell me the truth... There is a woman.
SALVATORE: Yes, it's a girl I saw at the station.
ALFREDO: What's she like? What's she like?...
