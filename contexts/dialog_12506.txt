GALE: Hi, Chief. You like the suicide?
WALLACE: Never reach out!
GALE: Hello, Mister Wallace.
DEAKINS: He's right. It's unprofessional.
WALLACE: If you reach out, you could get pulled over yourself.
GALE: What're we talking about? Reach out for what?
CHUCKY: I told them how you were upset we didn't save the guy...
DEAKINS: Saving people is not our job. It's as wrong to step in and save someone as it would be to push someone off.
WALLACE: You wouldn't push the guy, would you?
GALE: I didn't say I thought we should have saved him..
WALLACE: You didn't?
GALE: I said I wished it had at least occurred to me to consider saving him.
