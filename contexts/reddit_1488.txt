Does anybody else delete Reddit post immediately after getting downvoted?
So yeah, everytime i post something and it gets downvoted i quickly delete the post out of fear of sounding stupid or getting judged. Whenever i get downvoted, i automatically overthink about it, like what if i said something wrong. And honestly because of this i am starting to hate posting on Reddit.
