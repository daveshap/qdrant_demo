MARGO: Pendergast? Are you all right?
PENDERGAST: No. I think I'm hallucinating.
MARGO: You're not. Where is it?
PENDERGAST: Gone.
MARGO: Wounded?
PENDERGAST: No. A chromium alloy tipped .45 caliber bullet bounced off that thing's skull like a spit ball. I think it was bothered by my light.
MARGO: That would fit. It's nocturnal. Quick. Come inside.
