GILLIS: Hello, Artie. Good evening, Miss Schaefer.
BETTY: You don't know how glad I am to see youl
ARTIE: Walking out on the mob. What's the big idea?
GILLIS: I'm sorry about New Year's. Would you believe me if I said I had to be with a sick friend?
ARTIE: Someone in the formal set, no doubt, with a ten-carat kidney stone.
BETTY: Stop it, Artie, will you? Where have you been keeping your- self? I've got the most wonderful news for you.
GILLIS: I haven't been keeping myself at all. Not lately.
BETTY: I called your agent. I called the Screen Writers Guild. Finally your old apartment gave me some Crestview number. There was always somebody with an accent growling at me. You were not there. You were not to be spoken to. They never heard of you.
GILLIS: Is that so? What's the wonderful news?
BETTY: Sheldrake likes that angle about the teacher.
GILLIS: What teacher?
BETTY: Dark Windows. I got him all hopped up about it.
GILLIS: You did?
BETTY: He thinks it could be made into something.
GILLIS: Into what? A lampshade?
BETTY: Into something for Barbara Stan- wyck. They have a commitment with Barbara Stanwyck.
