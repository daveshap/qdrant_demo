Is there anyone who still hopes to grow old with someone?
Recently, I’ve been seeing more and more posts about the pressures of staying in a monogamic relationship and how we all should just love and accept that love may end someday. But I have trouble reconciling with this thought because I truly want to grow old with someone and just one person alone. I don’t want multiple loves. I want at least one real thing. And if I find that one real thing, I want to do the best I can to cultivate, nourish, and keep that relationship alive. 

Am I the only who feels this way? Just wanted to see if there are still people who are looking for the same thing as I am.


EDIT: Wow, I didn’t expect this to blow up, but it’s so great to see that I’m not alone in this. It’s encouraging to see that there are still a lot of us who want this out there. Hoping for the best for all of us!
