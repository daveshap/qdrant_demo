Just laid off, needs some advice.
Ok, due to all the stuff going on, I just got laid off. Well before I got laid off I was in the progress of moving in about 3 to 4 months. Obviously getting laid off put a halt to that. My question is, should I get a job where I currently reside now and only work up until the date I move or take a 3-4 month employment gap and just start applying for jobs now in the city I’m moving to. 

I live in a small city so with all this going on, jobs are few and far between. Is a 3-4 month employment gap look bad on a resume if you have a legitimate excuse? Also I know 3-4 months isn’t a solid number and it could be longer since I’m not guaranteed a job within that timeframe.
