LOMBARD: It’s wet. Will this do?
RHIAN: Where’s your wallet? Have you got a wallet?
LOMBARD: Is this some kind of mugging? Because...
RHIAN: Shut up! Where’s your wallet?
LOMBARD: In my jacket. Left inside pocket.
RHIAN: Reach for it and throw it to me. And... My finger’s on the trigger, you hear!
RHIAN: A private investigator... You’re not Austrian?
LOMBARD: Should I be?
RHIAN: What’s a French private investigator doing here?
LOMBARD: Can I get up now?
RHIAN: No! What do you want here? How do you know me?
LOMBARD: As you know from speaking to Phil, your friend Leon has disappeared, Rhian. His family have hired me to find him.
RHIAN: ...Leon’s not here. How did you get here? Phil doesn’t know where I live.
LOMBARD: Well, I obviously do. And I also know that Leon’s not here, Rhian. But I thought that you might know where I should look for him.
RHIAN: You thought wrong. I haven’t seen Leon for months.
LOMBARD: Haven’t you? Then why the worried messages on his answering machine, Rhian? I’d have sworn you expect him to be in trouble.
RHIAN: You-you’re wrong. I just called to ask if I could stay with him next time I’m in London. That’s all.
