WILL: You know, I was on this plane once. And I'm sittin' there and the captain comes on and is like we'll be cruising at 35
SEAN: You've never been on a plane.
WILL: I know, but the joke's better if I tell it in the first person.
SEAN: Yeah? You got a lady now?
WILL: Yeah, I went on a date last week.
SEAN: How'd it go?
WILL: Fine.
SEAN: Well, are you going out again?
WILL: I don't know.
SEAN: Why not?
WILL: Haven't called her.
SEAN: Jesus Christ, you are an amateur.
WILL: I know what I'm doing. She's different from the other girls I met. We have a really good time. She's smart, beautiful, fun...
SEAN: So Christ, call her up.
WILL: Why? So I can realize she's not so smart. That she's boring. You don't get it. Right now she's perfect, I don't want to ruin that.
SEAN: And right now you're perfect too. Maybe you don't want to ruin that.
