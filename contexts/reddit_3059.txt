In your opinion, which has the more likelihood of getting an interview; applying on a job board (such as indeed or angelco) versus applying on the company website directly?
While I do a combination of both, I wanted to know which gave me the more chance of getting my application seen. Obviously if I come across a job posting on a job board list website, their website is hiring for the role itself. But which would get my application to the top, so to speak? 

Thanks in advance y'all.
