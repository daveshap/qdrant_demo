SCHINDLER: Jews, yeah. Investors.
STERN: Jews can no longer own businesses, sir, that's why this one's for sale.
SCHINDLER: Well, they wouldn't own it, I'd own it. I'd pay them back in product. They can trade it on the black market, do whatever they want, everybody's happy.
STERN: Pots and pans.
SCHINDLER: Something they can hold in their hands.
STERN: I don't know anybody who'd be interested in that.
SCHINDLER: They should be.
GOLDBERG: What's that?
PFEFFERBERG: You don't recognize it? Maybe that's because it's not what I asked for.
GOLDBERG: You asked for shoe polish.
PFEFFERBERG: My buyers sold it to a guy who sold it to the Army. But by the time it got there - because of the cold - it broke, the whole truckload.
GOLDBERG: So I'm responsible for the weather?
PFEFFERBERG: I asked for metal, you gave me glass.
GOLDBERG: This is not my problem.
PFEFFERBERG: Look it up.
