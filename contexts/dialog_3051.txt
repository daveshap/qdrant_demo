BARBARA: I started racing after my parents died. There was something about the speed, the danger, that took me out of myself, that made the hurt go away. You wouldn't understand.
DICK: You'd be surprised.
BARBARA: Street racing isn't exactly an acceptable major at Oxbridge. They kicked me out. it doesn't matter. I've won enough money to do what I've always dreamed.
DICK: Just don't tell me you're hoping to run away and join the circus.
BARBARA: Alfred has supported me my whole life. Now I'm going to pay him back. I'm going to liberate him from his dismal life of servitude.
DICK: What are you talking about?
BARBARA: Servants, Masters, it's ridiculous. Alfred is the sweetest, most noble man alive and he's subjugated all his life and dreams to someone else.
DICK: Alfred and Bruce are like family.
BARBARA: Paying someone to prepare your meals and do your laundry and clean your dishes, you call that family?
DICK: Alfred's happy here.
BARBARA: Happy. You honestly don't know, do you? You can't even see what's in front of your own eyes.
