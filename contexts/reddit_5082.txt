What keeps you motivated?
I quit my full time call center job back in November after 2 months of being there for two reasons. One, I was miserable and two, I had gotten offered a promotion at my old part time retail job that I hadn't officially left so I went back there and now 3 months later, that promotion is unlikely. I was originally told I would start two weeks after I had quit my full time job back in November. I'm still receiving close to 40 hours per week but I don't have benefits and the pay is abysmal. I realize I've made the mistake of staying in retail too long and now I'm paying the price. I have a bachelors in communication with a concentration in new media and communication technology that I got a year and a half ago and an associate of science degree from 2015. 

 I started applying for other full time jobs about a month ago and my question to everyone in this subreddit is how do you stay motivated after receiving rejection after rejection??
