Unsatisfied with my major, need some advice on possible routes
I'm doing my  time in college doing some programming stuff but I don't feel motivated to pursue a busy and stressful career in the field. I think my ideal job is somewhere doing low level tech support for a small business but I am not too sure if  still need some high level degree for such a position. If it's a trade I am definitely ok with training like that but I am just not too sure how to proceed. Currently a part timer min wage while also in school. Not sure what my resources are and what my plan should be.

Edit: I am not sure exactly what flair i should use, I think this is the most appropriate but will change if someone thinks there is a better one. Maybe career planning but not sure.
