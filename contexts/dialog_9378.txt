GONZO: I hate to say this, but this place is getting to me. I think I'm getting The Fear.
DUKE: Nonsense. We came here to find the American Dream, and now we're right in the vortex you want to quit. You must realize that we've found the Main Nerve.
GONZO: That's what gives me The Fear.
DUKE: Look over there. Two women fucking a Polar Bear.
GONZO: Please, don't tell me those things... Not now. This is my last drink. How much money can you lend me?
DUKE: Not much. Why?
GONZO: I have to go.
DUKE: GO?
GONZO: Yes. Leave the country. Tonight.
DUKE: Calm down. You'll be straight in a few hours.
GONZO: No. This is serious. One more hour in this town and I'll kill somebody!
DUKE: OK. I'll lend you some money. Let's go outside and see how much we have left.
GONZO: Can we make it?
DUKE: That depends on how many people we fuck with between here and the door.
GONZO: I want to leave fast.
DUKE: OK. Lets pay this bill and get up very slowly. It's going to be a long walk.
GONZO: Do they pay you to screw that bear?
