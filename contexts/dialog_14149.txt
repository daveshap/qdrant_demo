ELLIE: Oh, Peter! What happened? Are you all right?
PETER: Come on—get in.
ELLIE: Oh, you've been hurt! There's a cut on—
PETER: Come on! come on!
ELLIE: What happened?
PETER: Just a road thief. Picks people up and runs off with their stuff. What a racket!
ELLIE: What'd you give him for the car?
PETER: A black eye.
