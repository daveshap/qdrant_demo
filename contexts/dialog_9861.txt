SMILEY: How's it going?
FORD: You gotta be kidding! This is unfuckingbelievable! I have to start the evening crawling down Capital Records, I shoulda chose suicide then, but oh no, the night was young! Next up, my guitar! The second most important thing I own and now it's toothpicks for the homeless on Hollywood Boulevard! Then, then, after I burned up your brother, Jazz... I should say as a fucking footnote I've usually treated women like shit -- used corsages, the wet spot, you know giving out Domino's Pizza's phone number and saying it's mine... Tonight was different. I felt respect. I felt love. Then Jazz left me... and <u>now</u> I get to die!
SMILEY: The point?
FORD: Let me go out like a man.
SMILEY: Anyway you want it, asshole.
