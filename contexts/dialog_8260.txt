KATHARINE: I'm impressed you can sew.
ALMÁSY: Good.
KATHARINE: You sew very badly.
ALMÁSY: You don't sew at all!
KATHARINE: A woman should never learn to sew, and if she can she should never admit to it. Close your eyes.
ALMÁSY: That makes it harder still.
ALMÁSY: When were you most happy?
KATHARINE: Now.
ALMÁSY: When were you least happy?
KATHARINE: Now.
ALMÁSY: Okay. And what do you love? Say everything.
KATHARINE: What do I love? I love rice pudding, and water, the fish in it, hedgehogs! The gardens at our house in Freshwater - all my secret paths.
ALMÁSY: What else?
KATHARINE: Marmite - addicted! Baths - not with other people! Islands. Your handwriting. I could go on all day. My husband. Almásy nods.
ALMÁSY: What do you hate most?
KATHARINE: A lie. What do you hate most?
ALMÁSY: Ownership. Being owned. When you leave, you should forget me.
THE PATIENT: Could I ask you to move? I'm sorry - but when you turn, the sheets, I can't really bear the sheets moving over me. Sorry.
HANA: Yes, of course, I'm so sorry. Stupid of me. Hana gets up, upset to have hurt him.
