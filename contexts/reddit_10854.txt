I wish life had checkpoints or a reset button
2018 has been absolutely horrible for me. I feel like I've ruined every connection to people I had. It feels like everyone hates me. I have a severe lack of trust in people that over and over again gets proven justified. I barely sleep at all or I sleep too much. I cry every day multiple times but most of the time it's for no reason at all or it's because my life is just so sad. I can barely function at work. I've been struggling with food for the last few months where I can't seem to eat normally. It's either eat way too much or I go at least a day without eating. I keep planning to do things like go for a walk or go see a movie by myself but I fail every time.

I wish it would just stop but I feel like I have absolutely no control over what happens in my life and there's no way to change it.
