re: "Has there actually been a statistically meaningful increase in hate-crimes since Trump was elected?"
[This thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/5wrgv4/has_there_actually_been_a_statistically/) was posted two years ago by u/[SkincareQuestions10](https://www.reddit.com/user/SkincareQuestions10). Unfortunately the numbers for hate crimes in 2016 and 2017 were not available at the time. 

In light of a new report by  [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/03/22/trumps-rhetoric-does-inspire-more-hate-crimes/?utm_term=.c23072d60be1) titled "Counties that hosted a 2016 Trump rally saw a 226 percent increase in hate crimes", I would like to know

a) if there is a meaningful increase in hate crimes since Trump was elected compared to two-year periods since 2009.

b) if there has been a meaningful change in the numbers for specific ethnicity/religious groups.

FBIs numbers showed hate crimes increased by [17% for 2017, compared to 2016](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/13/politics/fbi-hate-crimes-2017/index.html). "While the number of crimes increased, the number of agencies reporting also increased by about 1000." How can this be? And how would this affect the numbers?
