KILLAINE: An unhappy marriage hardly seems a sufficient reason for that.
BETTY: Why don't you arrest me and be done with it.
KILLAINE: I probably shall--after I've tortured you a little more.
BRANDON: How are you two getting along?
KILLAINE: Delightfully. Every time Miss Mayfield says something, I know less than I did before. Well, I may as well knock off for tonight. Good night, Miss Mayfield. Do let me thank you for your cooperation.
BETTY: There's one thing I may as well tell you. You'll find it out anyhow. I tried to run away--when I found him out there on the balcony. There wasn't any plane.
BRANDON: You didn't have to tell him that.
