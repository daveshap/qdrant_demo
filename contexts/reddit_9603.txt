A.M.A. Leah Wescott, Editor of the Cronk of Higher Education
HELLO REDDIT!!!

This summer CronkNews.com, higher education’s satirical news blog, celebrates its fifth birthday. If you’re not familiar with The Cronk, we aim to spur conversations and provide a voice for educators who may not have the safety to talk about the problems they encounter in the ivory tower. I’ve been in the higher ed game for over 20 years, worked at public, private, co-ed, single-sex, religious, independent, altruistic and soulless colleges. The same characters appear on every campus, which gave me hope that other educators would relate The Cronk’s satire. I had no idea!

In addition to editing, I’ve begun a traveling show called “There’s Something Funny about Higher Education,” in which small teams of educators use elements of humor as a springboard for innovation. Next summer I will tour with that workshop and another one called “There’s Something Funny about Assessment.” Assessment and humor? You know that’s possible, right?

What’s on your minds these days, student affairs?
