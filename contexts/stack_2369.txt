Is there a painless way to run Starcraft 2 on Linux? Now that Starcraft 2 is free to play, is there a painless way to run it in Linux?People have been doing it with different success for years, but the hacks are spead over different resources and often are distro specific.I have some specific limitations though.Since I saw file names like Starcraft64 on a Windows install of Starcraft 2, I would like to run it on a clean 64bit Linux distribution without the multilib 32bit compat layer installed.I am fine with either 64bit stable wine or the 64bit staging wine, no wrappers like PlayOnLinux or Lutris should be involved.Is it possible to install and run Starcraft 2 this way?So far I went to starcraft2.com website and downloaded the installer, but when I ran the file tool on it, I was told it is a 32bit Windows executable, so obviously it won't be able to run under pure 64 wine.
