CAROL: All right. What's the scoop?
PEGGY: On what?
MADDY: How come we're your best friends and we had to find out about you and Michael Fitzsimmons from Dolores?
PEGGY: She's unbelievable. Who needs satellites when we've got Dolores's mouth?
CAROL: I hear she does more than talk with her mouth.
MADDY: That's disgusting!
CAROL: ) Oh, Maddy, grow up. It says in LOVE WITHOUT FEAR that the tongue kiss as a means of genital stimulation is widely practiced and has much to commend it". Page eighty—six."
PEGGY: Did you memorize the whole book or only the good parts?
CAROL: Just what you underlined.
PEGGY: You're kidding...? Carol, you have beautiful hair.
CAROL: Come on. What's with you and Michael?
MADDY: Yeah. He's so cool and mysterious.
PEGGY: He's very interesting. For all his pretending to be a tough guy, he's really got the soul of a poet.
CAROL: I bet Dolores told Charlie.
PEGGY: That loud—mouthed little bitch~
MADDY: Peggy Sue!
CAROL: You better watch out for her. She's after Charlie.
PEGGY: Cool it kids. He's free to see other girls, if he wants.
MADDY: But I always thought that you would marry Charlie, Carol would marry Walter, and I would marry Arthur. We'd all live on the same street and take our kids to the park together and have barbecues every Sunday. It'll spoil everything if you and Charlie break up. That Michael doesn't look like the barbecue type.
PEGGY: I'm not going to marry him. I just went out with him once. I know! Why don't we go to the movies tonight. Just us girls. It'll be fun.
CAROL: Don't be silly. It's Saturday. Date night!
MADDY: Yeah. I've gotta go. Arthur's picking me up soon.
PEGGY: Okay. But let's have a girls night soon. Maybe a pajama party.
CAROL: Aren't we a little old for that?
