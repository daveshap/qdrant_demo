MR. HAND: Now, Mr. Spicoli, comes a rare moment for me. Now I have the unique pleasure of squaring our account. Tonight, you and I are going to talk in great detail about the Davis Agreement, all the associated treaties, and the American Revolution in particular. Now if you can just turn to Chapter 47 of Lord of Truth And Liberty.
SPICOLI: Hey, it's in my locker, Mr. Hand.
MR. HAND: Well, then, I'm glad I remembered to bring an extra copy just for you.
