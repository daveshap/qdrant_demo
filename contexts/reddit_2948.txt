My boss is leaving. Should I ask what he honestly thinks about my salary?
My boss is leaving the company. We’re pretty close and I feel like I can be honest with him. I’ve always wanted to ask if I undercut myself when I accepted the job but have always chickened out.

Now that he’s leaving, I feel like it could be a good time to do it. Do you think it’s okay for me to ask or do you think it’s a bad idea? I really don’t want to make him uncomfortable but feel like the answer could help me out in the future.
