LILA: He's dead.
PUFF: We bury the body. We disappear into the woods. Nobody knows.
LILA: No. This is the end of the road. There's a dead human being here. For all of his faults, he was a human being, and certainly a victim of his culture as much as anybody.
PUFF: Forget him, Lila. We'll disappear. We'll never talk about it again. We'll never talk again period. I love you.
LILA: Puff, what happened to you is as much my fault as Nathan's. Maybe more so, because I knew it was wrong and I went along with it anyway. I'm taking responsibility for the murder. I want you to go back to your old life.
PUFF: I won't let you do that. I shot the bastard. And I'm glad.
LILA: No. Go back to the woods. This is a sacrifice I need to make. In my world we have something called penance. It's another abstraction, but I had the concept drummed into my head during my years in the convent. It doesn't exist for you, and it shouldn't. See, I could never be free again anyway, so I might as well be in jail.
PUFF: Then I'll live for both of us, Lila. I'll be the most free, truest animal in the whole forest. For both of us.
LILA: That's what I'm counting on.
PUFF: But first I'll live among them, just long enough to testify before congress about the waywardness of humankind.
LILA: Okay. If you think it will help.
