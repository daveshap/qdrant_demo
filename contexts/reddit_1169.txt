I've exercised every day for a week now, and I am so proud of myself!
A big part of my anxiety come from how others view me and how fat I am. (167 cm and 85 kg) and as with all anxious thoughts, I know they're a lie but, you know. 

So I started running at night so the chances of being seen lowered then on day 3, I was passed by another runner and instead of thinking, I got more motivated. Now I run during dusk which is an improvement I didn't expect.

It's a small step for a regular person, but a giant leap for me.

Edit: Thanks for all the support! It actually gonna make it even easier to run tonight!
