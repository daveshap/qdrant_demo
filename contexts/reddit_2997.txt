7 weeks into the job, I keep making mistakes and my colleagues have enough. Should I leave?
Hi, I need your advice. I recently graduated and got my first serious job. It's a bit repetitive and doesn't have much to do with my studies, but I can use French there, I like it, and it's good money. Then, I got a mail from the place I used to intern at with a job opportunity. I got it and been working there for 7 weeks. So now, I work 4 hours every day at my first job and 3 days a week for 8 hours at my other job. I was so happy at this opportunity as it's what I'd like to do. However, it's been pretty bad. There is so much work for me to do at this second job and so little time, I keep making mistakes. Besides, it's the first time I work the office job with so many tasks at hand. I feel like I learned the complete basics during my first month (for example, to write down everything I need to do â€“ otherwise, I'll forget it), but it was already one month too late. As you can imagine, I make a lot of mistakes. A lot of them. The colleague I'm supposed to help told me recently I can't make any more mistakes, I've reached the limit. Because of all those problems, people at the office don't really like me (and I've never had people skills). I started to have bad anxiety concerning this job. It's Saturday, yet I'm afraid to go to this job on Monday. I feel like I'm too stupid for it and I have impostor syndrome. But on the other hand, I like what I'm doing there and it's really important for my career. There's no other similar place to work in my city. I know 7 weeks is not much time but the mistakes I make are all so dumb and the others expect me to make no mistakes at this point. So my question is, should I resign? Or should I keep learning, but also making mistakes until they snap?
