BILL: What a thoughtful, ever-lovin' thing to do-
MARGO: Bill? Have I gone crazy, Bill?
BILL: You're my girl, aren't you?
MARGO: That I am...
BILL: Then you're crazy.
MARGO: When - when are you coming back?
BILL: I leave in a week - the picture's all wrapped up, we previewed last night... those previews. Like opening out of town, but terrifying. There's nothing you can do, you're trapped, you're in a tin can-
MARGO: - in a tin can, cellophane or wrapped in a Navajo blanket, I want you home...
BILL: You in a hurry?
MARGO: A big hurry, be quick about it - so good night, darling, and sleep tight...
BILL: Wait a minute! You can't hang up, you haven't even said it-
MARGO: Bill, you know how much I do - but over the phone, now really, that's kid stuff...
BILL: Kid stuff or not, it doesn't happen every day, I want to heat it - and if you won't say it, you can sing it...
MARGO: Sing it?
BILL: Sure! Like the Western Union boys used to do...
MARGO: Bill... Bill, it's your birthday.
BILL: And who remembered it? Who was there on the dot, at twelve midnight...?
MARGO: Happy birthday, darling...
BILL: The reading could have been better, but you said it - now many happy returns of the day...""
MARGO: Many happy returns of the day...
BILL: I get a party, don't I?
MARGO: Of course, birthday and welcome home... who'll I ask?
BILL: It's no secret, I know all about the party - Eve wrote me...
MARGO: She did...?
BILL: She hasn't missed a week since I left - but you know all that, you probably tell her what to write... anyway, I sent her a list of people to ask - check with her.
MARGO: Yeah... I will.
BILL: How is Eve? Okay?
MARGO: Okay.
BILL: I love you...
MARGO: I'll check with Eve...
BILL: What?
MARGO: I love you too. Good night, darling-
BILL: See you...
MARGO: Birdie-
BIRDIE: Hmm?
MARGO: You don't like Eve, do you?
BIRDIE: Do you want an argument or an answer?
MARGO: An answer.
BIRDIE: No.
MARGO: Why not?
BIRDIE: Now you want an argument.
MARGO: She works hard.
BIRDIE: Night an' day.
MARGO: She's loyal and efficient-
BIRDIE: Like an agent with one client.
MARGO: She thinks only for me... ... doesn't she?
BIRDIE: Well... let's say she thinks only about you, anyway...
MARGO: How do you mean that?
BIRDIE: I'll tell you how. Like - let's see - like she was studyin' you, like you were a play or a book or a set of blueprints. How you walk, talk, think, eat, sleep-
MARGO: I'm sure that's very flattering, Birdie, and I'm sure there's nothing wrong with that!
