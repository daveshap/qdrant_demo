What is Ajit Pai's stance on Net Neutrality?
 My internet bubble is definitely very techie and when Ajit Pai was named the Chairman for the FCC I saw a flood of very negative articles on my timeline painting Pai as someone who hates net neutrality. Two examples:

http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2017/01/24/ajit-pai-donald-trump-s-fcc-pick-hates-net-neutrality.html

Then I listened to the "This Week in Google" podcast on the TWiT network and host Leo Laporte read off some conflicting quotes about Pai. Laporte was not trying to support him but bring up that we should probably take a wait and see approach because he has nuanced views and some support the basic pillars of net neutrality. 

I then read this Forbes article that reiterated what Laporte said. Forbes clearly has a business first attitude so they are hard to trust as well.

What is everyone's general thought on the future of Net neutrality under Pai? Does the FCC have the power to reverse the ruling that the internet is a public utility for instance? The role and reach of the FCC always confused me.
