Laser Induced Plasma Channel Inspired Gun The idea is for a gun that was manufactured by revolting mining colonists from existing mining lasers, as such a weapon would be easily procured from their own resources. The weapon itself would be similar to the LIPC weaponry being developed today, but it will be handheld (due to technology, science magic, or handwavium). The question I have is, in contrast to a regular laser rifle, would it still be effective in adverse atmospheric conditions, say, an ice planet or desert planet with light diffusing storms? What about a ship mounted weapon for space combat? If it is not theoretically practical to handle such a weapon today, assuming that the setting is in the far future with extreme technological advancements what would be a good workaround for such a disadvantage?
