CARDENAS: Doctor McCurdy, what was the cause of death?
MCCURDY: A massive cardiac arrest.
CARDENAS: What was Mr. Marsh's physical condition prior to his death?
MCCURDY: Very poor. He was suffering from severe arterial disease.
CARDENAS: Was the heart attack the result of natural causes?
MCCURDY: No.
CARDENAS: What induced it?
MCCURDY: We found a high concentration of cocaine in his blood.
CARDENAS: So, Mr. Marsh used cocaine?
MCCURDY: I don't think so. The membrane in his nasal passage didn't show any sign of long time usage.
CARDENAS: Then how did it get into his body?
MCCURDY: We found a bottle of Dristan nasal spray on the nightstand. It was filled with water and cocaine. Mr. Marsh had a head cold at the time of his death. I believe he wasn't aware that he was ingesting cocaine.
CARDENAS: Is this the bottle that was found on the nightstand?
MCCURDY: Yes.
CARDENAS: Your Honor, the State enters this evidence as exhibit A. Were any fingerprints found on the bottle?
MCCURDY: Yes -- those of Mr. Marsh and a thumb print of Miss Lawson's.
CARDENAS: Dr. McCurdy, what would cocaine do to someone in Mr. Marsh's condition?
MCCURDY: Increase his heart rate.
CARDENAS: -- And if he were in the midst of making love while under the influence of cocaine?
MCCURDY: It would be an added stress to his heart.
CARDENAS: What would be the effect if someone secretly administered cocaine to Mr. Marsh and then induced him to make love?
MCCURDY: It would be the same as shooting a gun at him.
CARDENAS: Thank you, Doctor McCurdy. Your witness.
