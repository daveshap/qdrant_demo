Reason behind offering free drinks and ping-pong table/video games/other perks
Not talking about providing decent health-care coverage and paid vacation. But I have noticed a trend verbalized by another subreddit I've noticed earlier today. That is, drumming up how the company provides free drinks, awesome ping-pong table, video game console (Nintendo Switch, Playstation, XBox, etc.). Is this normally deployed as a recruitment and retention tactic, more specifically using them as a bait for employees to stick around for longer hours for less pay, and make them more dependent on the company for social life (b/c they are working so much) so that the thought/decision of quitting is made more difficult, particularly when times get tough/abusive? Hope I sound clear.
