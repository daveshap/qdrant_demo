OFFICER PASKI: Second thing this week I can't explain.
GRAHAM: What was the first thing?
OFFICER PASKI: Some animals around the county exhibiting uncharacteristic behavior. Sometimes violent behavior. Theo Henry had two of his fingers bit off by his cow.
GRAHAM: Sounds like a virus.
OFFICER PASKI: No Father, they're edgy. On alert. Like they act when they smell a predator around... Peeing on themselves and everything.
