JIMMY: How do we do this, then?
ROSE: We just do it...we do it and we figure it out and we do as we do, I guess...
JIMMY: Do you love me, Rose?
ROSE: You're my handsome man.
JIMMY: I'm a bad person.
ROSE: No. No.
JIMMY: No, I mean: I'm telling you this, now. You see? You see I want to make everything clear and clean...and apologize for me....for all the stupid things I've done....that will eat me up....
ROSE: You feel like you want to be forgiven for your sins? Honey, you're not on your death bed, yet....this kinda talk's gonna get you in trouble --
JIMMY: --- don't. don't. Please. Just... listen to me...honey.... ...I've done...I've cheated on you.
