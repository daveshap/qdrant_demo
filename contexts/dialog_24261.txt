LINDA: Hey, Vaughan. How are you, Karl?
KARL: Tolerable, I reckon.
LINDA: Karl, this is my boyfriend, Doyle. Frank, why don't you and Karl go out in the garage and fix him up a place or play a game or somethin'. Vaughan, you ready to go?
VAUGHAN: Sure, I guess.
DOYLE: Don't rush ever'body, honey.
LINDA: Maybe you and Karl want to go with us?
FRANK: Naw, I don't want to. Me and Karl got things we need to do.
DOYLE: Hey, Vaughan, you know what I heard? I heard you been puttin' it to Albert Sellers that works over at the funeral home.
VAUGHAN: I know Albert. We're friends.
DOYLE: I heard you was more than friends. I heard Dick Rivers caught y'all all bowed up and goin' at it in the same room with poor, little, old Mizz Ogletree and her dead as a doornail layed out on a gurney.
VAUGHAN: That's ridiculous. That's just a total lie.
LINDA: Let's go, Vaughan. Frank, we'll be back in a little while. I'll bring you back somethin'. You're food's in the oven warmin' over.
DOYLE: See, you made him somethin'. Hey Vaughan, I was just goin' on with you, jokin' around, buddy.
