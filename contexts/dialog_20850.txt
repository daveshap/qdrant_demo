JACK: I know whose blood you need, to end the curse.
BARBOSSA: Say the name, or I slit your throat.
JACK: No you won't.
PINTEL: Now?
BARBOSSA: Now. No, don't kill him.
BARBOSSA: Allow me the humor of listening to your terms.
JACK: Simple. I have something you won't more than anything. The way to free you from the curse of the treasure. You have something I want -- more than anything.
BARBOSSA: The Pearl? Oh, that's fine. And just how do you expect this to work?
JACK: You give me the Pearl. Then I tell you who you need.
BARBOSSA: That's your offer? You, sailing away nice and pretty with the Black Pearl, and all I have is a name?
JACK: That's right.
BARBOSSA: I'm supposed to ... trust you?
