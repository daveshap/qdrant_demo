How to obtain the difference between two time fields in hh:mm:ss format? I have to 2 date fields in a table, ALARMTIME and ARRIVETIME.  I want to acquire the difference between the two in a new RESPONSE_TIME field in ArcGIS.<br>The only successful field calculation I could get is the answer in seconds using:DateDiff (\"s\[ALARMTIME], [ARRIVETIME] )But if I have 8:05:00am - 8:02:32am, I'd like to see 00:02:28 or 02:28 or 2:28 instead of 148 seconds.  Please help.  My response time field is a double.  I couldn't get any calcs to work using a date field.
