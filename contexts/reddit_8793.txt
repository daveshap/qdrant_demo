How have past Presidential administrations fought Congressional subpoenas?
Tomorrow, Democrats take over the House, [and they have a long list of investigations](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/17/magazine/democrats-trump-investigation.html) they wish to pursue.

House Democrats will have the [power to subpoena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contempt_of_Congress#Subpoenas), which they have [stated they are willing, and plan to use](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/here-come-subpoenas-what-house-democrats-plan-their-russia-probe-n933681). 

However, Irvin B. Nathan, former general counsel of the House of Representatives, [wrote warning Democrats](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/be-warned-congress-subpoenas-may-not-uncover-the-trump-administrations-secrets/2018/11/29/8b5f39f8-f3ff-11e8-80d0-f7e1948d55f4_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.e7058b61c395):

> Subpoenas are not self-enforcing. If subpoenas are ignored or disobeyed, there needs to be an effective mechanism to compel compliance.

Nathan continues with outlining the two methods of enforcement:

> Inherent-contempt authority permits the House sergeant-at-arms to arrest the resisting party and bring him or her before the full House for a trial. If adjudicated in contempt, the person can be placed in prison until the contempt is cured or the session of Congress expires. This approach was approved by the Supreme Court in the early 19th century but has not been used since the early 20th century because of its obvious disadvantages and political unpalatability. The House doesn’t even have a prison.

and

> Criminal contempt is initiated by the speaker transmitting a certification of contempt to the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia. Under the pertinent statute, the U.S. attorney is required to present the matter before a grand jury for the return of a felony indictment. Conviction would result in a prison term and/or fine. However, when it is an administration official who is carrying out the president’s policy in disobeying the subpoena, the Justice Department almost certainly will not prosecute.

I have two questions:

1: How have past Presidential administrations fought subpoenas? 

2: What specific political pressure and legislative actions have past Congresses taken to force compliance with subpoenas?
