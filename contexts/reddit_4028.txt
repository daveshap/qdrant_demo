Don’t date if you don’t have the time
This should be common sense, but if your schedule is too busy to even make free time for yourself, please don’t date. I’m so sick of being strung along by people with ridiculous schedules where it’s like pulling teeth to make plans. How can you expect to have a serious relationship if it’s so difficult to even meet up for the first time?

I’m tired of getting my hopes up about someone only to find out that they are never available to meet in person. I’m not looking for a texting buddy.
