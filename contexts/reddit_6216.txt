Employee before me left halfway through their 1st day and never returned. Is this an omen for me?
Today was the first day at my new job. When I came back from my lunch break one of the guys told me that they were betting to see if I was going to come back or not. This is because the last hire left for his lunch break and never came back. I thought it was weird they even divulged this information to me.

What was so bad that made this guy run for the hills. Is this a sign that the guy saw something that I'm not seeing?

Conflicted on leaving or staying as I'm basically on the fence with the experience I've had.
