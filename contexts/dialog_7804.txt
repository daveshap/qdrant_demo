LLOYD: HARRY! I found the treasure!
HARRY: Go away, assface.
LLOYD: Did you hear what I said? The treasure! Like on your map!
HARRY: Yeah, right. Why don't you show it to your girlfriend"?"
LLOYD: JESSICA and I are through. I couldn't stand being with her knowing you liked her. It wasn't worth our friendship. Oh, and she also has a boyfriend.
HARRY: Do you hear something, Captain Rob?
LLOYD: Captain Rob came back?
HARRY: Yeah, he does sound like a rat fink.
LLOYD: Hey, there's no reason to use that kind of language!
HARRY: Good one, Captain Rob. He does look like a you-know-what.
LLOYD: Oh, telling inside jokes now, are we? That's it. You're out of the cool crowd. Next time Turk's passing out wedgies, you ain't gettin' one.
LLOYD: HARRY, would you like to share with the rest of us what's so funny?
HARRY: You wouldn't get it. Just a private joke between best friends.
