What is the mathematical reasoning behind the inverse square law of two charges? The Hon. Henry Cavendish performed an experiment with two spheres, by which he proved that no electric force is produced inside a hollow charged sphere. In other words, proving that no electric field is produced inside the sphere, means that the charge present on the surface is in equilibrium. How does it prove the inverse square law?
