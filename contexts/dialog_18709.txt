JUDGE OTTO: Clarence Norman White, do you understand how serious are the crimes with which you have been charged?
MUMFORD: I do.
JUDGE OTTO: Do you realize how insidious it is to invade the most private thoughts and secret lives of unsuspecting people?...
JUDGE OTTO: ...People who have come to you with the faith that you know what you're doing... and that you are who you say you are?
MUMFORD: Yes, your honor.
JUDGE OTTO: It means absolutely nothing to me that so many of your patients have come forward with praise for you and your therapeutic skills. You understand that?
MUMFORD: Yes.
JUDGE OTTO: Mr. White, I am frustrated that the criminal code in this state allows a maximum sentence of only six months and a maximum fine of only $2000.
MUMFORD: I'm sorry, your honor.
JUDGE OTTO: What?
MUMFORD: I'm sorry you're frustrated.
JUDGE OTTO: Are you disrespecting this court, Mr. White?
MUMFORD: No, sir. I was empathizing. Sorry.
JUDGE OTTO: Maybe you can empathize with this -- Maximum fine. Three months in jail, three months house arrest. Sentence to begin immediately at the Orchard Valley Correctional Facility. Case closed. This court is adjourned.
LIONEL: It's a country club. Don't worry about it.
MUMFORD: Thanks for your help, Lionel.
