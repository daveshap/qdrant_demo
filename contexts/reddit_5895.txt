Should I get an associates in business administration for an executive assistant job?
Hello, I wasn’t really sure where to post this. I just hope someone can give me a word of advice. I am finishing my first year of college now. I switched from bachelors in accounting to business administration. I wanted to switch to online classes since I really dislike living on campus and honestly I’m not really enjoying college in general. While researching online programs I also came across programs for an associates degree in business administration. I have a few career choices in mind such as an executive/administrative assistant or a bank worker. 

Really what I’m wondering is, is an associates degree going to be a worthwhile idea for me? My biggest concern is saving money and getting into the work force quicker. Also, I don’t plan on making millions of dollar. I know I won’t make as much with an associates degree, but would it be enough to get by and guarantee I’d get a job?
