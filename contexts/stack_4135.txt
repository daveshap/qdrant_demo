Traveling to Brazil & Argentina, passport expires in less than 3 months, will I have a problem entering? I have a flight to Brazil in 2 days and (due to personal negligence) I just realized my passport expires in less than 3 months.My passport is Bulgarian. I don't need a visa for Brazil (up to 90 days). I'm planning to stay about a month. On my government's website, it doesn't mention anything about validity requirements - only that the passport is valid at the time of entry.After Brazil I was planning to go to Argentina (also visa free for 90 days). At that time my passport would be valid for only 1 month. I am planning to return to my country of residence (Spain) about a week before the passport expires.I also have an ID card (EU) that's valid for the next 8 years.There's a Bulgarian consulate in the Brazilian city where I'm staying, I could also go there and try to get a new (emergency) passport.I've been reading a lot about the 6-month-passport-validity rule, but there's no clear information for my case. Some sources say that Brazil and Argentina enforce it, other say they don't. Wondering if anyone has experience with a similar situation?
