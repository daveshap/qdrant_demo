SANDRA: Thank you. I'll bet you need to --
JOSEPHINE: Yes.
SANDRA: Down the hall on the right. The door sticks. You have to really pull it.
WILL: Is that Dr. Bennett's car?
SANDRA: He's up with your father.
WILL: How is he?
SANDRA: He's impossible. He won't eat. And because he won't eat, he gets weaker. And because he's weaker, he doesn't want to eat.
WILL: How much time does he have left?
SANDRA: You don't talk about those things. Not yet.
DR. BENNETT: Will.
WILL: Dr. Bennett. It's good to see you. My wife, Josephine.
DR. BENNETT: A pleasure.
