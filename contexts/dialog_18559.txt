VICTORIA: Then they may read about me.
DISRAELI: Indeed, and for that they are eternally grateful.
VICTORIA: Is that not enough?
DISRAELI: In so many ways ... and yet it is your presence they crave. A figurehead.
VICTORIA: I never thought to be bullied by you, Mr Disraeli. You, I thought, understood a widow's grief.
DISRAELI: Forgive me, ma'am, I cannot speak for the nation, only for myself. As Prime Minister I confess I miss your presence, but that is only an expression of my own selfish desires and I should not burden you with it.
VICTORIA: I stay here because I am happy. Is that such a terrible crime?
DISRAELI: No, ma'am.
