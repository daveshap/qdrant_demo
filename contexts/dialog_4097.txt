KEVIN: Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, nine. Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, a thousand. It's all there. Wow. A hundred and twenty-eight thousand dollars.
TUNA: Jesus Christ, I'm getting a boner just looking at it.
KEVIN: What's the matter, George? Something wrong? You look like you just fucked your mother.
TUNA: Cheer up, man. Half this money is ours. We're fucking rich.
GEORGE: It's not enough.
KEVIN: What?
TUNA: What the fuck are you talking about, man?
GEORGE: The set-up is wrong. We're doing all the legwork, and at the end of the day, we're still paying retail. We're getting middled.
KEVIN: So?
GEORGE: So, we need to get to the source.
TUNA: Source? What about Derek?
GEORGE: He's getting middled, too. And Derek's our partner. What's good for us is good for him.
KEVIN: Okay. So we need a source. Where do we start?
GEORGE: Who speaks Spanish?
TUNA: This is bullshit, George. We're never going to find anything down there.
KEVIN: You know, he's got a point. We're fucking Americans. We stick out like sore thumbs.
DEREK: I don't think so.
GEORGE: You guys are such babies. You want to go home, go. Me, I'm not going to stop until I find the fucking motherlode.
