MARY: I hope you get everything you want out of life --
CLAY: Thanks.
MARY: You've earned it -- the horse ranch on the Toulomoe -- the girl in the spotted gingham.
CLAY: The who?
MARY: You should know. She's in your dream.
MARY: Ever since you've looked after Steve you've had the dream -- a ranch on the river -- good grass, good water, barn corral and house --- that part you've shared with Steve. The girl in gingham you plan sneakin' in when he isn't looking.
CLAY: Go on. Tell me more about her.
MARY: She wears this gingham dress -- cooks popovers -- makes jam in season -- makes her own soap from pig fat and wood ashes and has cheeks the color of red apples.
CLAY: I'll make the soap myself.
MARY: But the rest is right.
CLAY: Will she be dark or fair?
MARY: Blonde as a new mop. And beautiful as the girl on a feed store calendar.
