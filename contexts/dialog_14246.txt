CLARENCE: What'd you say?
GEORGE: I said I wish I'd never been born.
CLARENCE: Oh, you mustn't say things like that. You . . . . . . wait a minute. Wait a minute. That's an idea. What do you think? Yeah, that'll do it. All right. You've got your wish. You've never been born.
GEORGE: What did you say?
CLARENCE: You've never been born. You don't exist. You haven't a care in the world.
