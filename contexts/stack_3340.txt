Short SF story revisits Poe\u2019s classics Mid 1980\u2019s I read a SF short story in class and need help identifying it.  I could be wrong, but as I recall, the title was merely a year (2064 A.D., 2154 A.D., or similar).  If memory serves me correct, it was set in that year.  A handful of tourists signed up for a tour of a house/castle.  One by one, they were being killed off by various means described in stories by Edgar Allan Poe (and replaced with duplicates, I believe).  However, I do believe the tour group may have been unsuspecting because (in a possible nod to Bradbury\u2019s F451), books had long been banned/abandoned/destroyed and consequently they were unfamiliar with Poe\u2019s works.  In the end, I believe the \u201cguide\u201d flew off in a helicopter with the duplicates/replacements and the house/castle crumbled.I could have muffed it all up, but does any of this ring a bell with any one?  Any help would be appreciated!  - BkR
