I’ve been more depressed lately and am starting to feel indifferent towards my partner of 2 years. Is this normal??
I have struggled with anxiety for many years but recently have started to feel pretty depressed (I think due to medication changes and the weather). I don’t find joy in many things anymore. I just started on Prozac but it hasn’t kicked in yet. I live with my(28F) partner(35M) of about 2 years and have started to feel sort of indifferent about the relationship. In the past I have had a lot of anxiety about our relationship and future, but now I just feel “meh” about it. Should I be concerned or is this a “normal” feeling while in a pit of depression?
