What Professional Development opportunities would you recommend?
My workplace just told us that there's an opportunity to take a course for professional development before the end of the year. This is great, but this is not a benefit we knew we had, so now I'm desperately trying to think of something I'd like to gain more skills in.

I work in the recreation at a community centre. I've been in the field on and off for a 3-4 years. I'm not quite sure what I want to do after, but I'd love to stay in recreation or transition to tourism or outdoor adventure. Most of the ideas I have for professional development are certifications (a more advanced first aid, mental health first aid), but I look forward to seeing what other opportunities there may be out there.

There's no real budget, but we just need to request it and see if it will be approved. I assume we won't be allowed to take a course that's more than 1-2 days long.

Thanks in advance!
