BELLE: The people, Jabez -- the people.
JABEZ: The -- folks or people, what's the difference among friends?
JABEZ: Howdy, Squire! Howdy! Oh -- how do you do, Squire.
SQUIRE: How do you do, Belle? How are you, Jabez? Well -- mighty elegant house you got here.
JABEZ: You really think so?
JABEZ: Hey, you! Watch out there -- you're scuffing my Brussels carpet -- Consarn them.
BELLE: Jabez! Careful --
JABEZ: Oh -- Didn't mean to talk like that in front of a lady. Get some wine for the Squire, Belle.
SQUIRE: Well, Jabez -- I'm a little pressed for time. You wanted to discuss something -- some business --
JABEZ: Oh yes -- yes. Won't take a minute. Can you keep a secret?
SQUIRE: Why of course --
JABEZ: Dan'l Webster is coming to my party.
SQUIRE: Dan'l Webster?
JABEZ: Yes -- and that's the reason I wanted to talk with you. You got my invitation?
SQUIRE: Yes.
JABEZ: Now look -- here's a list of the people I invited -- they're all the right kind of people -- or did I miss anybody?
SQUIRE: The only one you missed -- is the President.
JABEZ: You think that's a joke? I had him on there too, but I was afraid Dan'l Webster might feel insulted.
JABEZ: You keep that -- that's for you. I want you to talk up the party to make sure that the best folks really come.
SQUIRE: You want me to go around --
JABEZ: Yes siree -- that's the idea. Get them all here and then say: Look
SQUIRE: You mean that's all you had me come out here for?
JABEZ: Now, Squire, you're not going to let me down. We still want to do a lot of business together, don't we?
SQUIRE: Well -- yes --
JABEZ: That's fine. Now you can tell people all about the house, but don't mention Webster.
SQUIRE: You are not so sure that he'll come.
JABEZ: Oh yes -- I am -- want to bet?
SQUIRE: Why not -- ?
JABEZ: How much?
SQUIRE: 5000 -- that's just what I owe you.
JABEZ: Shake!
WEBSTER: Hello, Colonel! Want a lift?
DANIEL: Well, I wouldn't mind. But my name's Daniel Stone.
WEBSTER: All right, Daniel. Jump in.
DANIEL: Gee -- that Fair --
WEBSTER: It hasn't opened yet?
DANIEL: No -- but I can hardly wait -- Mister -- tell me, will there really be -- -- a man that eats fire?
WEBSTER: Guess there will, if it says so.
DANIEL: And two unpara-- unparalleled Cir-cass-ian beauties? What is that?
WEBSTER: Young man -- you got me there.
DANIEL: 'N Daniel Webster will be there.
WEBSTER: A varied list of attractions. And which would you like to see first, Dan'l?
DANIEL: I think I'd like to begin with the fire-eater --
WEBSTER: And what about Daniel Webster?
DANIEL: Well, I thought he'd come in the middle.
WEBSTER: And serve him right!
WEBSTER: Daniel! Don't ever let me catch you doing that again!
DANIEL: Why? It don't hurt.
WEBSTER: It does hurt! And don't you do it again.
DANIEL: Make them go faster, Mr.... ?
WEBSTER: No, Daniel -- they are not race horses. They are good old friends of mine. I call 'em Constitution and Bill of Rights, the most dependable pair for long journeys. I've got one called Missouri Compromise, too, and then there's a Supreme Court -- fine, dignified horse, though you do have to push him now and then.
DANIEL: Golly -- I'd like to see all your horses!
WEBSTER: Maybe you can, sometime, Daniel. I'm a farmer, you know, and like to show my farm -- but the thing I'd like to show you most, you'll have to see for yourself.
DANIEL: What's that, sir?
WEBSTER: Well -- it's high and it's wide and it goes a long way and there is a wind blowing through it and a blue roof over it -- it's the hills up here and the rivers running south and the new States growing in the West.
DANIEL: Anybody can see that.
WEBSTER: You're wrong, Mr. Stone. There are people who live and die without e'er seeing it. They can't see the country for the money in their pockets -- And some think their state's the country, or the way they live is the country, and they're willing to split the country because of that. Well, I hope you'll meet all those, when you're grown. You'll meet the fire-eaters and the Circassian beauties -- that's part of the fair, to be sure. But if we'd had to depend on them, in a permanent way, the country would have stopped at the Allegheny mountains.
DANIEL: But it didn't stop. I know it didn't stop. Granny told me it didn't.
WEBSTER: No, siree, it didn't. And it won't -- no matter what happens -- just as long as the folks at the fair believe in freedom and Union. So -- Giddyap, Constitution -- and let's keep going, Mr. Stone.
