Is there any precedent for the Executive Branch not enforcing sanctions (or any other passed legislation)?
The deadline for implementing sanctions against Russia has passed. The White House has said that [it will not implement said sanctions](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/rich-russians-still-waiting-to-exhale/2018/01/29/7df459ca-052a-11e8-8777-2a059f168dd2_story.html). This is despite Congress passing the bill, and the President signing it.

* Has something like this happened before?
* Is there anything in this particular law that allows the executive branch to exercise discretion?
* If there is no legal justification for the aforementioned act of not implementing, is the recourse to challenge their refusal in the courts, or some other measure?
