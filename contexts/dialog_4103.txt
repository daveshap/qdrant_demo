BARBARA: Surprise.
GEORGE: Baby, you didn't have to come.
BARBARA: What, and miss all the fun? C'mon, not a chance. So, what's the verdict?
GEORGE: Lawyer says he can plead it down to five years. I'll serve two.
BARBARA: Two years. George, I can't wait that long.
GEORGE: What? You're not going to wait for me?
BARBARA: George, I went to the doctor. I don't have two years.
GEORGE: Which brings me to rule number three: which says, fuck rules one and two, skip bail and take off.
