FOLEY: She may not make it through the program, but she's got more heart and more character than you'll ever have. I've seen your college record. I've never heard of most of those schools. Tell me something, Mayo. Did you buy that degree?
ZACK: No, sir! It was the hardest thing I ever did, sir! Until this.
FOLEY: That's a lie, Mayo. You've gone through a lot worse, haven't you?
FOLEY: Stop eyeballing me, mister! I've looked through your file and done a little checking, and I know it all. I know about your mother. I know your old man's an alcoholic and a whore chaser. Life sure has dealt you some shitty cards! Hasn't it, Mayo?
ZACK: I'm doing okay, sir.
FOLEY: No you're not. You're failing the big one, baby, and I don't just mean in here. I mean in life. I've watched you, Mayo, and you don't mesh. You grab-ass and joke around but you don't make friends, not the way the others do.
