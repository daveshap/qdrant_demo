THEO: Hello Dwight.
DWIGHT: Hi.
THEO: What are you working on?
DWIGHT: Just a little experiment.
THEO: Work, work, work. Is that all that you do?
DWIGHT: Well, there's a lot riding on this project.
THEO: The Professor might have everyone else fooled, but I know who the real brains of the operation is.
DWIGHT: You do.
THEO: That's what turns me on about you, Dwight. You're so smart.
DWIGHT: And sexy.
THEO: Of course. So sexy.
THEO: Ooh, you hair is so soft and silky. What do you use on it?
DWIGHT: Just a little Rogaine.
