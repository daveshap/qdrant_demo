FOLLETT: I have eighteen more minutes!
MUMFORD: I don't want to hear any more today.
FOLLETT: Why not?
MUMFORD: Mr. Follett, do you trust me or don't you?
FOLLETT: Well, I don't know... I only been seeing you --
MUMFORD: Without trust, there's no point to any of this. You might as well not come.
FOLLETT: Now hold on, I didn't say I didn't want to come --
MUMFORD: Good, then go.
LILY: You're early... it's not ready. What happened?
MUMFORD: My patient had to leave early.
LILY: Who was that?
MUMFORD: Does the phrase nosy" have any meaning to you
LILY: I think it's like... inquisitive.
MUMFORD: It was Henry Follett.
LILY: Man, you see him a lot. And it's very wrong to reveal it. Next you'll be saying what his problem is.
MUMFORD: What do you want to know?
LILY: You're terrible. I'm never telling you anything.
