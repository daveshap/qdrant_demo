What am I doing wrong? Always get rejected after interviews
I started applying to jobs in my chosen field about a year before I finished my masters, so let’s say summer 2017.  Between then and December 2018, I put in nearly 400 applications to local, state and federal agencies (mostly state though). Finally in December 2018 I picked up a job with the state, but it’s not even remotely close to my field and the pay is awful.

Since then I’ve focused on applying to jobs in my field. Again, I believe I’m up to nearly 100 apps with nothing to show for it. And today I got rejected from yet another interview, except this time it’s my ideal career that has rejected me. I’m absolutely crushed.

I don’t understand what I’m doing wrong. I have three bachelors degrees and a masters, so I definitely meet qualifications. But so far every interview I’ve done has ended in failure. I’ve researched interview techniques and have a nice succinct party line for the one job that released me (rather than me leaving). Yet I am continually rejected. I’m trying to not give up but atm I’m losing hope.

Any suggestions as to things I can change, do, alter, learn, or literally anything I can do to make it past the interview stage?
