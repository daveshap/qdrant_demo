Do you ever say, "Okay, Let's start doing ____" and then just, literally wait for yourself to move?
It's just.. I dont know. I was so prepared to do something, and when I wanted to start, I literally just waited. Soon, I ended up getting anxious, lol. Like, I can't make an action for myself.

Edit: I'm so freakin glad to be able to relate to yall! I really thought it was only me.
