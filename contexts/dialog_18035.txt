PAUL: Annie, what is it?
ANNIE: The rain... sometimes it gives me the blues.
ANNIE: When you first came here, I only loved the writer part of Paul Sheldon. But now I know I love the rest of him too. As much as Misery loves Ian. I know you don't love me--don't say you do--you're a beautiful, brilliant, famous man of the world; and I'm...not a movie star type. You'll never know the fear of losing someone like you if you're someone like me.
PAUL: Why would you lose me?
ANNIE: The book is almost finished. Your legs are getting better. Soon you'll be able to walk. You'll be wanting to leave.
PAUL: Why would I want to leave? I like it here.
ANNIE: That's very kind of you, but I'll bet it's not altogether true.
PAUL: It is.
