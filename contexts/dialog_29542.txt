OLD FRED: How's she doing?
EDGAR: She wants to lay down. I'm a little worried.
OLD FRED: Well, I brung her something I know she likes.
EDGAR: Damn, Fred, you can't give away all those.
OLD FRED: Forget it. I got vegetables coming out my ears. Usually the varmints eat up half my crop, but lately I ain't so much as <u>seen</u> a gopher or a jack-rabbit nowheres.
EDGAR: If that ain't the truth. And I count on them for a little bit of stew meat...Thank you, Fred.
OLD FRED: We playing cards tonight?
EDGAR: I think I'm gonna be sitting up with her.
OLD FRED: I'd do the same. Well, catch you Thursday.
EDGAR: You bet.
