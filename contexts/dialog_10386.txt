JEROME: No bother.
IRENE: I've been asked to compile a log for the investigators--they want to know everyone's whereabouts last night.
JEROME: Last night? I was at home.
IRENE: Can that be, er, verified? Were you alone?
JEROME: No it can't be verified. Yes I was alone.
JEROME: Looks bad, doesn't it, Irene? What about <i>you?</i> Where were you last night?
IRENE: I was at home.
JEROME: Were <i>you</i> alone?
IRENE: Yes.
JEROME: So we don't know for sure about you, either.
IRENE: No.
JEROME: Why don't we say we were together?
IRENE: Why would we do that?
JEROME: I have better things to do this week than answer the foolish questions of some flatfoot. Don't you?
