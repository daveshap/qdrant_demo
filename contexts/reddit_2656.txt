Did I miss my window of getting a “big girl job”?
I’m a 23 year old who graduated last May with a BA in Comm/PR. During my spring semester of my senior year I applied to as many jobs as I could. My goal was to move out of state. When I graduated in May I didn’t have anything lined up so I continued to spend all my time job searching/applying. Then job market in my town is very scarce when it comes to PR/Marketing agencies, plus like I mentioned, I really wanted to move out of state anyways. 

Eventually it was October and still no luck so I knew I needed some type of income. I ended up landing a job as a counter manager for a makeup brand (basically a glorified retail job) and live at home with my parents. I was still trying to send out applications in the mean time to hopefully land something else. Then corona hit and I’m now on unemployment. 

I am feeling like I lost my chance. Here it is a year after graduation and I’m working basically a retail job (well was before corona). I feel like I don’t have a shot at a “big girl job” because to employers, I graduated college and then went into a retail job. With corona I feel like it’s near impossible because now I’m trying for an even smaller market with all the new 2020 college grads. I’ve been trying to work on things during quarantine to keep my skills up. I was looking to go into a digital marketing/content strategy type of position but I don’t know if I’m too far out of the game to have a chance. 

Is there anything I can do to help better my chances?
