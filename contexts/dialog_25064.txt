STOSH: Thanks. You're a real pal! What're we goin' to do with it?
HARRY: Plant it, Animal, and grow us a chicken for Christmas.
HOFFY: If I were you, Sefton, I'd eat that egg some place else. Like for instance under the barrack.
SEFTON: A little weak today.
DUKE: Come on, Trader Horn! Let's hear it: what'd you give the Krauts for that egg?
SEFTON: Forty-five cigarettes. The price has gone up.
STOSH: That wouldn't be the cigarettes you took us for last night?
SEFTON: What was I going to do with them? I only smoke cigars.
DUKE: Nice guy! The Krauts shoot Manfredi and Johnson last night and today he's out trading with them.
SEFTON: Look, this may be my last hot breakfast on account of they're going to take away that stove. So will you let me eat it in peace?
STOSH: Ain't that too bad! Tomorrow he'll have to suck a raw egg!
HARRY: He don't have to worry. He'll trade the Krauts for a six-burner gas range. Maybe a deep freeze too.
SEFTON: What's your beef, boys? So I'm trading. Everybody here is trading. Only maybe I trade a little sharper. So that makes me a collaborator.
DUKE: A lot sharper, Sefton! I'd like to have some of that loot you got in those footlockers!
SEFTON: You would, would you? Listen, Stupe -- the first week I was in this joint somebody stole my Red Cross package, my blanket and my left shoe. Well, I wised up since. This ain't no Salvation Army -- this is everybody for himself. Dog eat dog.
DUKE: You stink, Sefton!
