SALVATORE: Oh, how I looked for you, Elena! You'll never know. I wrote, telephoned, nothing. Nobody ever answered. But I dreamt of you for years! That's why I went away...and never came back here. Even as the years passed, in all the women I met, I was only looking for you. I had success it's true, but there was always something missing... I'd never have imagined that all this had to end because of the man who was like a father to me. A crazy lunatic!
ELENA: He wasn't crazy. In the beginning I was upset. I think I really hated him. But then, with time, I understood what he said...and your silence too.
SALVATORE: But I never saw that note! I must have covered it with my hand, without realizing it, that's the only explanation...
ELENA: What difference does it make to find an explanation? That's the way it went. But Alfredo didn't betray you, he was the only one who really understood you. Salvatore, if you had chosen to be with me, you'd have never made your films. And that would have been a pity! Because they're wonderful, I've seen them all. But you shouldn't have gone and changed your name. You should have kept your own.
