I have a crush on my brothers friend.....
I have a crush on my brothers friend who regularly stays the night. He is really nice but flirts with a lot of girls and openly talks about it whenever I'm there. We are both the same age and get along really well. I just don't know what to do since he always invites me to hang out with them and I just get so nervous. Any advice?
