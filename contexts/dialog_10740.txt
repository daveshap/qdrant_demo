ENID: You can open your eyes now.
SEYMOUR: Oh... uh, thanks a lot Enid... I really appreciate it...
ENID: No, Doofus... blow it out!
SEYMOUR: Arrrghhh! Ah Jeez... Christ...
ENID: Are you okay?
SEYMOUR: It's just my stupid back. I'll be all right in a minute...
ENID: What is that?
SEYMOUR: Oh... uh... It's just this elastic thing I have to wear for lumbar support...
ENID: What, like a girdle?
SEYMOUR: Maybe now you understand why I can't get a date.
ENID: Yeah, well, you're not the only one. Everybody I know has totally fucked up problems... It seems like only stupid people have good relationships...
SEYMOUR: That's the spirit!
ENID: I mean, I'm eighteen years old and I've never even had a real, steady boyfriend for more than like two weeks!
SEYMOUR: Really?
ENID: Never...
SEYMOUR: I'm starting to think that even if I did get a girlfriend it really wouldn't change anything.
ENID: I know. It's not like it makes all your problems go away.
SEYMOUR: Then again, that's easy for me to say, since I'll never even get a date. I'm sure you have hundreds of guys who are interested in you.
ENID: Actually, I've got a total crush on this one guy right now, but it's a really fucked-up situation...
SEYMOUR: Oh yeah?
ENID: Oh wait, you met him... remember that guy Josh? I'm like practically obsessed with him, but I can't do anything about it because Becky would freak out.
SEYMOUR: Why?
ENID: Never mind, it's way too complicated... Did you have problems like this when you were my age - where you're totally confused all the time?
SEYMOUR: I won't even dignify that with a response.
ENID: I wonder if you really like all these old records or if you only like the fact that nobody else likes them?
SEYMOUR: Who knows?
ENID: Aren't you going to get that?
SEYMOUR: Let the machine get it. I have no desire to talk to anyone who would be calling me...
