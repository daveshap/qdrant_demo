I didn’t do enough Junior year
I think everyone said Senior year was supposed the be the most fun and least stressful year cause I was supposed to do stuff Junior year. But, I never asked for teacher recs, never even LOOKED at the CommonApp, didn’t write my essay, didn’t apply or look for scholarships, didn’t tour any colleges, and didn’t try to get involved in clubs. So now I’m doing all of that now as a senior and I think that’s why I’m getting stressed out. Probably should’ve done more as a Junior lol
