HEROINE: Fine, Chief.
BOZO: Gimme the keys.
HEROINE: NO, but I will lock you in.
BOZO: What?
HEROINE: We'll be on the other side waiting for you. If you become food I don't want the only set of keys in the belly of one of those things. It's your funeral.
BEER GUY: We're better off.
BOZO: Who's with me?
GRANDPA: I'll go with ya.
BOZO: What are you gonna do? Throw your teeth at 'em? Sit down, Cocoon.
HEROINE: You are taking a chance that is not worth the risk.
BOZO: Well, we are one miracle short tonight. So, just guard the stairs?
HEROINE: Done. But you're locked in. Will you hold the keys?
