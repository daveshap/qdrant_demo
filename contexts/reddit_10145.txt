I wish I could swap places with a person who died that wanted to live.
There’s so many people in this world who wanted to live, but died too young in a cruel twist of fate. Cancer. Car accident. Murder. I feel so selfish that I’m still here instead, when I don’t even want to be. If I could swap places with a person like that, I’d do it without hesitation. At this point I’m only alive out of a sense of obligation.
