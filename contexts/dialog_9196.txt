BEN: How'd you know it was me?
ALICIA: I'm blind, not deaf. Wanna come in?
BEN: I'm not really dressed for a party.
ALICIA: Relax, it's casual.
BEN: No, I mean...I'm a little...dusty...
BEN: Those yours too?
ALICIA: My step-dad's. I'm strictly into stone. I was wondering when you'd walk by.
THE THING: You know, you could'a run an ad in the personals.
ALICIA: Sensual blind chick seeks three-ton
THE THING: This ain't permanent. My friend Reed's working on a cure...I think.
