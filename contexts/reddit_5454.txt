Is there any advantage to have a BA in English while pursing IT jobs?
So I graduated college a few years ago with a BA in English but I've been having issues with finding a good job.  My friends recommended I maybe pursue the field of IT and get some additional schooling done.  

Is there any particular field of IT or computer sciences that benefit from having a BA in English in addition to the necessary degrees/certs for that field?
