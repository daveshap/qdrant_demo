I'm tired of this game.
My whole life I've always been told to do my best, but where does it stop? You can always do more, you can always sacrifice your fucking life for a goal, but what's the price you end up paying?

I threw everything valuable in life away by chasing the fucking first letter of the alphabet. I have no social skills. I have no hobbies. I am horribly neurotic. I'm irritable all the time. I have brain fog all the time. I've spent so much of my doing the shit that I "should do" that I've never pursued what I care about. When people ask me what I do for fun I make up some bullshit answer, because I don't do anything for fun. School is my life, and I can't slow down now or all this work would have been for nothing.

My dad is fucking 65 years old. I don't really have any meaningful interaction with him outside of the weekends, and even then I'm always pissed because of school. Was the SAT score worth it? Is the fucking number 4.0 worth it? How much time am I realistically going to have left with him?

I'm probably going to apply ED to a T20 school, but part of me hopes that I just end up at my state school. I'm tired of this game, and will it ever end if I go to a T20?  I would get a whole lot more out of learning how to party and have a good time than i would to keep chasing this shit. I just want to be content in life with people I care about, but instead I sit around procrastinating all day because of how burned out and unfulfilled I am from this game, and it keeps me distracted from how far behind I've fallen in every part of my life.

Fuck this game. It's not worth it. I can't wait until second semester when I'll actually be able to embrace everything I've neglected in life for so long.
