BUD: Mr. Kirkeby, I don't like to complain -- but you were supposed to be out of here by eight.
KIRKEBY: I know, Buddy-boy, I know. But those things don't always run on schedule -- like a Greyhound bus.
BUD: I don't mind in the summer -- but on a rainy night -- and I haven't had any dinner yet --
KIRKEBY: Sure, sure. Look, kid -- I put in a good word for you with Sheldrake, in Personnel.
BUD: Mr. Sheldrake?
KIRKEBY: That's right. We were discussing our department -- manpower-wise -- and promotion-wise -- -- and I told him what a bright boy you were. They're always on the lookout for young executives. BUD Thank you, Mr. Kirkeby.
KIRKEBY: You're on your way up, Buddy-boy. And you're practically out of liquor.
BUD: I know. Mr. Eichelberger -- in the Mortgage Loan Department -- last night he had a little Halloween party here --
KIRKEBY: Well, lay in some vodka and some vermouth -- and put my name on it.
BUD: Yes, Mr. Kirkeby. You still owe me for the last two bottles --
KIRKEBY: I'll pay you on Friday. And whatever happened to those little cheese crackers you used to have around?
