NORMA: Well?
GILLIS: This is fascinating.
NORMA: Of course it is.
GILLIS: Maybe it's a little long and maybe there are some repetitions... but you're not a professional writer.
NORMA: I wrote that with my heart.
GILLIS: Sure you did. That's what makes it great. What it needs is a little more dialogue.
NORMA: What for? I can say anything I want with my eyes.
GILLIS: It certainly could use a pair of shears and a blue pencil.
NORMA: I will not have it butchered.
GILLIS: Of course not. But it ought to be organized. Just an editing job. You can find somebody.
NORMA: Who? I'd have to have somebody I can trust. When were you born -- I mean, what sign of the zodiac?
GILLIS: I don't know.
NORMA: What month?
GILLIS: December twenty-first.
NORMA: Sagittarius. I like Sagittarians. You can trust them.
GILLIS: Thank you.
NORMA: I want you to do this work.
GILLIS: Me? I'm busy. Just finished one script. I'm due on another assignment.
NORMA: I don't care.
GILLIS: You know, I'm pretty expensive. I get five hundred a week.
NORMA: I wouldn't worry about money. I'll make it worth your while.
GILLIS: Maybe I'd better take the rest of the script home and read it -
NORMA: Oh no. I couldn't let it out of my house. You'll have to finish it here.
GILLIS: It's getting kind of late --
NORMA: Are you married, Mr. -- ?
GILLIS: The name is Gillis. I'm single.
NORMA: Where do you live?
GILLIS: Hollywood. The Alto Nido Apart- ments.
NORMA: There's something wrong with your car, you said.
GILLIS: There sure is.
NORMA: You can stay here.
GILLIS: I'll come early tomorrow.
