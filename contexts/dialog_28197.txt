JEANNE: They've abandoned me... like everyone.
AULON: What... what do you mean?
JEANNE: It's been weeks since they spoke to me. Since the coronation... no signs... nothing...
AULON: Maybe their silence is a sign...? Maybe it's a sign to go home?
JEANNE: It's not time yet. My mission is not over yet. There is still more I must do before I can really -- finally -- go home.
AULON: But how do you know that these -- these voices aren't really just -- well, you.
JEANNE: Well of course they're me! That's how God talks to me. If you listen hard enough, even you can hear him. Everyone can hear him.
AULON: But I hear so many voices... one voice saying one thing, another voice saying the opposite -- love your enemy, kill your enemy -- what is good, what is evil...?
JEANNE: All you have to do is stop talking and just listen.
AULON: But how do you know what you hear is the truth?
JEANNE: I don't know it. I feel it.
AULON: You make it sound so simple...
JEANNE: The truth is always simple... it's you, Jean, who's making things complicated.
AULON: Me?! It's not me, it's God who makes everything complicated! If he's all-powerful, why not let the English stay on their island in the first place? And why let this war go on for a hundred years? And why send you out to fight when a girl like you should be at home with your family? Why, why?!
JEANNE: So... even you don't believe in me anymore...
AULON: Jeanne... I believe in you... more than anyone...
