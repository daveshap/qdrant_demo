JEFFREY: Nobody.
DOROTHY: Shit. You better tell me something.
JEFFREY: I was an experiment. Just to see if I could do it.
DOROTHY: An experiment? Hey, I've seen you before.
JEFFREY: I sprayed your apartment. I took your key. I really didn't mean to do anything but see you.
DOROTHY: Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.
JEFFREY: I saw you come in, talk on the phone. Get undressed.
DOROTHY: The phone. What did you hear on the phone. Tell me. Word for word.
JEFFREY: You said hello, to Frank. You wanted to talk to someone? Don? And little Donny. You said something about Momma loves you. And something about a Meadow Lane. Something in an hour. I don't remember any more.
DOROTHY: That's right. That's what I said. You have a good memory. Then what?
JEFFREY: Well.
DOROTHY: THEN WHAT?
JEFFREY: Then you got undressed.
DOROTHY: How many times have you sneaked into girls' apartments and watched them undress?
JEFFREY: Never before this.

JEFFREY: No. Come on.
DOROTHY: NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I want to see you.
JEFFREY: Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave.
DOROTHY: No way.
