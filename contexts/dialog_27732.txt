GRAY: I presume you shall. This won't be my last visit here.
JOSEPH: I want to speak to you alone. I saw something. I heard.
GRAY: What did you hear?
JOSEPH: I know --
GRAY: Oh, you'll have ample opportunity -- ample -- Good morning, Dr. Fettes.
FETTES: Good morning.
FETTES: I just saw Gray. What was he laughing at?
MACFARLANE: He has his own idea of a joke. Perhaps his horse tickled him in the ribs.
FETTES: I've just been to see Mrs. Marsh. Georgina is doing splendidly. The incision has healed -- clean and fine -- but she doesn't seem to have any desire to walk.
MACFARLANE: When she's ready you bring her to me -- I'll show her how.
FETTES: Dr. MacFarlane, I wonder if you know what happiness you've brought those people.
MACFARLANE: That's only our duty, Fettes -- that's the end at which we aim with all this nasty business.
FETTES: I suppose one must pass through this purgatory to the heaven of being a good doctor.
MACFARLANE: That's the way of it, Fettes. You bring the lassie to me.
FETTES: Don't you want to find the white horse, Georgina? You can't find him from a wheelchair. You have to walk and run to find him.
GEORGINA: I can't.
MACFARLANE: You can't -- can't! Stop trying to bribe her with childishness about white horses. Let the child stand and walk -- her spine's all right. I know it's all right.
FETTES: But she must want to stand. She must want to walk.
MACFARLANE: Confound me, the child's a cripple, of course she wants to walk. Child, I say to you get up out of that chair and walk.
