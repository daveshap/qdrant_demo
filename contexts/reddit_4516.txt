I cant stop thinking about killing myself
I cant stop thinking about either blowing my head off or crashing my car into traffic. I don’t think I’ll actually do it since i have have think of my family dealing with it but i can’t get these thoughts out of my head, they won’t go away it’s literally 24hrs a day , the anxiety is crippling, i feel alone and unwanted & i try to hard to be normal but sometimes i break and people reject me. I have to always pretend to be strong for my family since they rely on me so much but it hurts to feel this way all the time
