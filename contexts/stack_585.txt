Trying to get linksys wifi dongle to work wusb600n version 1 Trying to get my wifi usb dongle to work on Ubuntu 17.04 it is a linksys wusb600n version 1. Shows wifi networks. However, it does not connect and the indicator light on the dongle does not turn on. Once you plug it in, the indicator light blinks a few times then shuts off. Need a driver that I can install on my system to make it work. No drivers from linksys or support either. PLEASE HELP! Been at it for two days now. Any command line read outs you need, I can provide. Thank you.
