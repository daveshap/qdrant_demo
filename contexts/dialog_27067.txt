STACY: Ever take a look at the women who work in pet stores? Wow.
STACY: Good luck.
STACY: Jesus, are you gay enough or what.
STACY: Very attractive. Good idea. Now I <u>really</u> want to fuck you.
STACY: ... you can always tell the ones who'll do anal.
STACY: Kinda makes you wonder why more people don't put a bullet through their fuckin' skulls, doesn't it.
STACY: Looks like they just airbrushed the dick out of his mouth.
STACY: Why don't they have TV shows about people whose daily lives you'd be interested in watching. Y'know. Like SKINNY LITTLE WEAKLING. Or BIG FAT GUY. SICK OLD MAN. FAMILY OF LOSERS. Wouldn't that be good?
STACY: Two blacks and a Mexican in a car. Who's driving?
UNCLE JOHN: I don't know.
STACY: The L.A.P.D.
