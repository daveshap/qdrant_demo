How do I make friends?
The important part is the second part

This is really sad but How do I make friends. Making friends in hs is so much harder than other grades and I just entered a new district. Everyone already knows each other and have they're groups. I dont like approaching groups since I dont want to just interrupt them and it would be super awkward having a strange kid just walk up to you and your friends, stare at you, and try to join your conversation. Because of this I dont have any friends and just a few acquaintances and I sit alone for lunch everyday. It didnt bother me at first but it begins to suck more and more as time goes on.

I feel like the hardest part for me is making and holding conversations. It's been such a long time since I've had to talk to someone I didn't know and didn't know me that it's really hard. It's hard for me find topics to talk about . And if we don't have the same interest what then? It just leads to awkward silence. I'm bad at keeping the conversation going so sometimes people will ask me things and I awnser without thinking and dont ask "You?" so it just stops there. Its been such a long time since I've har a chance to be myself that I dont remember how to be myself so I'm not as funny or entertaining. How do I fix these problems?
