Any recommendations for certificates?
I graduated a year ago with my master’s in student affairs. I don’t want to go for my PhD.... yet.... BUT I would like to get a certificate or something. I almost went for another masters degree, but I think that’s too much for me right now. I watch webinars, but I’m looking for something more than just a webinar. 

Has anyone done a certificate or heard of one that would benefit a career in student affairs??
