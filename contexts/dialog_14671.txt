MICHAEL: I know how to tag a damn conch....
JAKE: The readings suck....
MICHAEL: Maybe it's the tags that suck....
JAKE: I made them, man....
MICHAEL: I stuck them on, man....
JAKE: You didn't stick them on right....
MICHAEL: If you made them right, it wouldn't happen...They leak....
JAKE: A blind man could find more conch on a mountainside....
MICHAEL: You couldn't find your ass with both hands....
JAKE: You leave me high and dry...You come back looking like a zombie....
MICHAEL: Hey!
JAKE: Shouldn't pick on that. Sorry. I'm sorry about your brother....
MICHAEL: Yeah, well, just stop yelling.
