something to do when you need something to distract yourself
The world is a shitty place right now. everyone is stressed and bad feelings are spiking. so here’s what i give to all of you: a piece of advice to keep you going when everything is going wrong. 

draw a flower. 

draw a large flower, a small one, draw one with 4 petals or one with 50. it doesn’t matter how good or bad you are at art. you don’t need good supplies, it doesn’t even need to be on its own sheet of paper. draw a flower in a book, a notebook, on your bed frame, wherever you want. 

everything is getting dark, emotionally. sometimes it helps to take 5 minutes and distract yourself with a little flower.
