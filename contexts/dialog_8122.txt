EXLEY: Sir, I took the call. It's my case.
DUDLEY: Edmund, you don't want it and you can't have it.
EXLEY: Yes, I do, sir.
DUDLEY: It's mine. I'll make you my second in command.
PINKER: We got a total of forty-five spent 12-gauge Remington shotgun shells. Three men with five-shot-capacity pumps. All of them reloading twice.
EXLEY: Hold on... We need to canvass. See if a purple Mercury was seen around here tonight.
DUDLEY: Why?
EXLEY: We got a call earlier on three Negro youths. Firing shotguns in Griffith Park from a late-model purple Mercury Coupe.
DUDLEY: Get on it.
