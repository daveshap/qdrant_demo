CHASE: I think the question would be, do you have a thing for bats?
BRUCE: So, this Riddler, he's dangerous?
CHASE: What do you know about obsession?
BRUCE: Not much.
BRUCE: It's a stretch but I'll manage.
CHASE: The letter writer is obsessed with you. His only escape may be...
BRUCE: To kill me.
CHASE: You understand obsession better than you let on.
BRUCE: No insights here, doc. Just trying to get comfortable on your couch. Oops. Times up.
CHASE: That's usually my line.
BRUCE: Look, I'd love to keep chatting-
CHASE: Would you? I'm not so sure.
BRUCE: But I'm going to have to get you out of those clothes.
CHASE: Excuse me.
BRUCE: And into a black dress.
