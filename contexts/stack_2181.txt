Where can I find a Leaf Stone? I've been playing through Pokemon Crystal on my phone, and it's time for me to face the Elite Four. My team is alright at this point, but I've been stepping on egg-shells for a while now; I've got an Exeggcute. Sadly, this little collection of fragile eggs needs a Leaf Stone to become a BBP (Big Beautiful Pineapple...), but I can't seem to find one that is available BEFORE the Elite Four.Where can I find a Leaf Stone before fighting the Elite Four?
