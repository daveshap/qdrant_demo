RANDY: Yes?
MRS. HAMMEN: Oh, Stewardess. My husband is very sick. Can you do something, please?
RANDY: Well, the doctor will be with you in just a moment. One thing: do you know what he had for dinner?
MRS. HAMMEN: Yes, of course. We both had fish. Why?
RANDY: Oh, it's nothing to be alarmed about. We'll get back to you very quickly.
ELAINE: Doctor Rumack, Mister Hammen ate fish. And Randy says there are five more cases, and they ate fish, too.
DR. RUMACK: Let's see now. The co-pilot had fish. What did the navigator eat?
ELAINE: He had fish, too.
