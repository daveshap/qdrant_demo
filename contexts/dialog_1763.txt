MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR: Ask me why we're so successful.
Z: Why are we so successful?
MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR: I'm glad you asked me that question!
MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR: What do you see out there?
Z: ...Ants...
MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR: Right! Ants! Millions of creatures, each with his assigned task, all pulling together!
MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR: You see? Being an ant is being able to say, Hey -- <u>I'm</u> meaningless
Z: But -- but I've always felt life was about finding meaning...and then sharing it with someone special, someone you love.
