Does anybody else feel mentally exhausted from battling with there anxiety constantly?
People use the term ‘mentally exhausted’ and I’ve never understood what they ment, but I do now, I’ve had severe anxiety and daily panic attacks for 6 years now (turned 26 yesterday) and for my birthday my girlfriend arranged for us to go on holiday for 4 days, which of course on 1 hand I need the break, but on the other i didn’t want to be killing the holiday by not wanting to do stuff, so I got myself some backup Valium to carry around with me in case my anxiety was to get to a point where I could not cope, I’m on my last night now going home in the morning and I did not end up having a single tablet other than my daily propranolol, and I’m super proud of myself I have did everything from going to fair grounds to shopping in busy town centres and markets, I’ve been out from morning until night every day, which is obviously good, it has took me so long to get to this point and it has not been without it’s set backs, and I mean really bad set backs ones where I feel like I’m back at square 1 again, but I always dust myself off and start again, but recently I feel like my brain could do with a rest, I’ve had panic attacks daily while I’ve been here but you would of never been able to tell, my symptoms seem to change every now and then, at the moment mine are- not being able to take a deep satisfying breath or yawn, pains in my chest and pressure in my head, and insomnia, but you no what guys I’m happy believe it or not I just wish I could be normal again, but until then  I will just keep plodding on and hopefully get there 1 day.
