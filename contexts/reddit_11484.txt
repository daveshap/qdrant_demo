Broke up with my first girlfriend after two and a half years
At the beginning of high school I met a girl. We started dating shortly after and we were together for two and a half years. It was my first girlfriend, and we lived many cool things together. But we always had some trust issues, she has never been fully open with me.

In recent times some things started to bother me more, because even talking to her, nothing changed. It wasn't something serious, she did not cheat on me. But I was no longer feeling well. She seemed to put me in the background. I was no longer a priority. So I decided it was time to end.

She said I was abandoning her. I felt a little guilty.

It's not easy to spend all this time together with someone and now, everything change. I feel a little directionless.
