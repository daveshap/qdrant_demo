HAWK: Cool.
JAM: I'm really sorry about that, man.
HAWK: Don't be a fembot. So, are you like grounded because of last night, or what?
JAM: Of course, but has that ever stopped me before? Besides, my mom's going to some church meeting and won't be back till late. No sweat... See you guys in school.
LEX: Poor, Jam, man. Imagine having to stash your KISS records inside Carly Simon album covers. No question, Mrs. Bruce is a psycho-bitch from hell.
TRIP: You're one to talk, Lex. Your mom's a fuckin' dyke.
LEX: Trip, a female gynecologist does not a lesbian make. And even if it did, at least my mom didn't give birth to me while she was on LSD.
TRIP: Shrooms! And even if it was LSD, I can still give my mom a kiss without smelling the catch of the day.
