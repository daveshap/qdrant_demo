A recruiter contacted me about a different job than the one I applied for
I'm testing the waters by applying for job opportunities that seem interesting. I applied for a job involving one set of skills through a recruiting agency in my field. One of the recruiters I worked with before reached out to me about a job that requires a different skillset that I don't quite have. Should I mention that I applied for a different position or is there a better way to approach this without burning a bridge.
