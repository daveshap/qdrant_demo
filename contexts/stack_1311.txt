Wiring 240v to 120v outlet? Is there an issue wiring a traditionally single-pole receptacle as a double-pole? (i.e. Instead of L-N-G, it would be L1-G-L2)Hmmm. When I started typing this I could not find an IEC-320-C13 to NEMA 6-20P power cable to save my life. I have... so the question is more of a curiosity at this point. But such a cable is difficult to resell as opposed to one with a NEMA 5-15P termination....Would such a wiring decrease the ampacity of the outlet? This is fine to me. Just means I need a bunch more. Equipment will be pulling max of 6A at 240v.Thanks! If you're further curious about this read on but that pretty much sums up my question.I'm searching for cost effective means of wiring my equipment. I've purchased five Tripp Lite PDU1230 for a cost of ~$800. This can wire up probably all the equipment I have. But I have space for about 5x the equipment. I can wire up everything for less than $1600 (subpanels, wire, connectors, outlets, etc.) versus $4000 in PDUs. But it's contingent on wiring a 5-15 receptacle as L1-G-L2 vs. L-N-G.Using NEMA 6-20R/P will be significantly more expensive (~$2,000) than the 5-15 but cheaper than the PDUs. Clarifications / UpdateThis is for 240v devices only; in an area with only 240v devices (racks of them); accessed, operated, and maintained by myself only.Other precautions such labeling area as \"240v only\"; placing plug covers over the unused receptacle; limiting one device per outlet, etc. can all be done. (Again, I'm the only person with access though.)I'm not looking to increase ampacity as someone commented below. I'm assuming the doubling in voltage, if anything would halve the ampacity. In this case 6A is 80% of the 7.5A capacity and therefore save to use.This question is, as I mentioned above, \"more of a curiosity at this point.\"
