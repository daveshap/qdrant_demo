FISHER: Yes, well, my theory was that she may be running because she gets attention... Negative attention is attention. Like when women whack you on the street because of your column, that's negative attention.
IKE: This is about her negative attention, not mine. Did you get the reimbursement for the dress yet?
FISHER: No, I'm paying for the dress. Do you think she's still gonna run?
IKE: I don't know.
IKE: Look -- I'll be in there later today. I'll come by and tell you all about it.
FISHER: You're coming here?
IKE: Yeah.
FISHER: Then come for dinner.
IKE: Okay, we'll order out.
FISHER: Order out like a Philistine, when you got the Galloping Gourmet here?...
IKE: Get this man a Kamikaze.
GEORGE: Splendid dissection of Maggie Carpenter, very professional job.
IKE: You could have told me you were fiance number three.
GEORGE: And end up in the papers? I've been humiliated enough already to last a lifetime, thank you. I'm sorry she got you canned.
IKE: Thanks.
GEORGE: She's a cacophony of contradictions.
IKE: Well, I'm writing another article on the cacophony.
GEORGE: Ah, can't stay away from her, can you? Like a moth to a flame.
IKE: Guess you'd know about that. You're an entomologist, right? How's business?
GEORGE: Not bad. I was traveling around studying the reproductive and migratory patterns of locusts when Maggie met me.
IKE: Neuter a locust, feed the world.
