Hitting CTRL+ALT+DEL on my finances. It’s okay to be happy to start at zero at 47yrs old, isn’t it?
Background:  Used to own a business with a partner.  Started the business on a handshake and never did any formal contract together.  Fast forward to the end of that relationship and I walked away with nothing.  Fast forward from there to find through some VERY savvy bookkeeping and less than scrupulous ethics, I have accrued a $120,000 debt to the Canada Revenue Agency. 

Thanks to some kind guidance from Reddit and a local trustee, I got that fine reduced to $28,000.  

Then the marriage hit the rocks.  Been separated almost three years.  JUST sold the house a couple weeks ago. 

By selling the house, and settling my divorce, I can settle my debt, my marriage and end my wage garnishment.  

I’ll have almost no assets, but no debt either.  

I plan on rebuilding my credit which is horrible, but I’m actually pretty happy to start life over at zero.  

Thoughts on my next step?

EDIT:  Thank you for all the love.  This post wasn’t intended as a “pat me on the back” post, but rather an inspiration to let you all know that the worst shit luck and awful situations can always be turned around. 

Face the things you fear.  Admit they will suck, but face them anyways. 

The time it takes to fix past mistakes may seem insurmountable.   But time moves forward wether you take action or not.  Before you know it.... shit is behind you. 

Never.  Ever.  Give up.  Please..... if it feels too much..... never ever stop trying.
