I've found cures to my allergies and my depression, but they aren't FDA approved.
Back when I was younger, my allergies were treated for about 6 months by an at the time experimental treatment called sublingual immunotherapy. I was cured temporarily, but was unable to finish the treatment. I had my allergies come back and come back worse.

Again, I had a breakthrough recently, only this time my anxiety and depression got significantly better after taking Plan B when a condom broke.

There is no long term version of Plan B, only medications similar or in tandem with other medications. I tried a medication (Lessina) with a lower dose and it made my depression and anxiety worse. I believe this is due to the estrogen included in Lessina worsening my anxiety.

I'm so incredibly depressed right now.

I'm going in to talk to my boss tomorrow and I'm fairly certain he is letting me go due to my poor attendance.

I got in a car accident the other day and even with my low paying job, I don't have the income to pay for the deposit for repairs. Without it, I don't have any chance to afford repairs.

Having any job at all makes me so anxious and depressed that I lose all interest in anything except sleeping.

I'm tired of learning the way to relief for me is not possible. I'm tired of trying every single day only to fall harder than I could imagine. My car is under my sister's name so I could get the loan and I don't want to burden her when I'm unable to pay for it soon.

I'm tired of burdening my friends that I live with. 

I just want to be gone.
