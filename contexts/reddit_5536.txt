Is my salary low balled?
Prior to getting this job I had no experience with body shop estimating. My last job I was a porter at a dealership and I got tired of that. I asked my then manager to train me on the computers and do office work. I did that for a few months and found the job I have now. I knew some of the same programs that the current dealership uses. I have no certification or anything like that. My manager was willing to teach me how to do it and says he will sign me up for classes so I will be certified. My question is...my pay is $14.50/hr or about 29,000/yr. I am salary. Should I have asked for more? And what should I do about that. I know typically estimators make decent money but I thought since I wasn't certified, it would make sense not to pay as much. But is my current salary too low?
