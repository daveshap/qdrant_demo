CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN: Good morning, Private James. Please come in. I should like you to meet my uncle, Herr Minister of Police Galgenstein.
RODERICK: How do you do, sir?
RODERICK: The captain was the nephew and heir of the Minister of Police, Herr Galgenstein, a relationship which, no doubt, aided in the younger gentlemen's promotion.
CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN: Your loyalty to me and your service to the regiment has pleased me very well -- and now there is another occasion on which you may make yourself useful to us; if you succeed, depend on it, your reward will be your discharge from the army, and a bounty of 100 guineas.
RODERICK: What is the service, sir?
CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN: There is lately come to Berlin a gentleman in the service of the Empress Queen, who calls himself the Chevalier de Belle Fast, and wears the red riband and star of the pope's order of the Spur. He is made for good society, polished, obliging, a libertine, without prejudices, fond of women, of good food, of high play, prudent and discreet.
