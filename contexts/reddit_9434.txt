Cheap ways to show my wife i appreciate her.
My wife isnt working right now due to medical issues. The bills are paid and theirs food on the table but we dont have much money for anything else outside of monthly expenses. She does what she can around the house and for me and our two girls. What are some cheap ways I can show I appreciate the work she is doing? I need some ideas. Thanks.

Sorry if this is not the best sub for this.
