MRS. CARMICHAEL: I have some ice from the machine.
JEZZIE: Bring it in.
MRS. CARMICHAEL: Is he all right?
JEZZIE: He doesn't like it.
MRS. CARMICHAEL: I don't blame him. What should I do with the ice?
JEZZIE: Pour it in.
MRS. CARMICHAEL: On top of him?
JEZZIE: He's melting it as fast as we dump it in.
MRS. CARMICHAEL: Okay. My husband's got two more bags. He's coming. They're heavy.
