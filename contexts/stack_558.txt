Geary signature image I found the signature option for Geary and I tried making a signature with an image. Referring to a file on my pc doens't work. When i paste the data-url from the image in the src box, it shows the image correct, but when I send the mail, the receiver gets the error 'filename of attachment not set' or equivalent depending on email client.Anyone an idea how to fix this?Kind regards
