JACOB: Okay, does anybody here know what's going on?
SETH: Yeah, I know what's going on. We got a bunch of fuckin' vampires outside trying to get inside and suck our fuckin' blood! That's it, plain and simple. And I don't wanna hear any bullshit about I don't believe in vampires" because I don't fuckin' believe in vampires either. But I do believe in my own two fuckin' eyes
SETH: You too, preacher?
JACOB: I'm like you. I don't believe in vampires, but I believe in what I saw.
SETH: Good for you. Now, since we all believe we're dealing with vampires, what do we know about vampires? Crosses hurt vampires. Do you have a cross?
JACOB: In the Winnebago.
SETH: In other words, no.
