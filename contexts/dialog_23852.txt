MILES: Hey, Jack. Jack.
JACK: Hrnrnrn?
MILES: That was quite a day yesterday.
JACK: Yep. Quite a day.
MILES: Quite a week.
JACK: Want me to drive?
MILES: No, I'm okay.
JACK: Hey, why don't you invite Maya to the wedding?
MILES: Somehow I don't think inviting Maya to your wedding is the right move. In fact, after your bullshit, it's going to be hard for me to even go to the Hitching Post again.
JACK: You're so negative.
JACK: Come on, let me drive.
MILES: I'm fine. You rest.
JACK: I feel like driving.
MILES: What's wrong?
JACK: Nothing. Buckle up, okay?
MILES: What the fuck!
JACK: You said it looked like a car accident.
MILES: What the fuck!
JACK: I'll pay for it.
MILES: Look at this!
JACK: I don't know. Doesn't look like anybody got hurt in this one.
MILES: Oh, no. Oh, Christ. No, you don't.
JACK: You need a new car anyway.
