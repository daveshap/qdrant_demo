MUNRO: I must receive proof more conclusive than Mr. Poe's opinion before I weaken our defenses by allowing militia to withdraw.
JACK: Chingachgook's of the same opinion. Taken together, that's gospel. Your fort will stand or fall depending on Webb and reinforcements, not these colonials' presence.
MUNRO: I judge military matters, Captain Winthrop, not you.
HAWKEYE: That judgment is not more important than their right under agreement with Webb to defend their farms & families... Major Heyward was at John Cameron's. He saw what it was.
MUNRO: What did you see, Major?
CORA: beyond the periphery of men, staring at him.
HEYWARD: Munro is expecting him to be the good soldier in defense of British military interests.
