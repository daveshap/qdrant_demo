CAROL: That's maybe the best compliment of my life.
MELVIN: Then I've really overshot here 'cause I was aiming at just enough to keep you from walking out.
CAROL: So how are you doing with those pills? Well, I hopahopahopa.
MELVIN: Takes months to know... They work little by little. Talking like this is exhausting.
CAROL: Have you ever let a romantic moment make you do something you know is stupid?
MELVIN: Never.
CAROL: Here's the trouble with never.
MELVIN: You don't owe me that.
CAROL: That wasn't payment. When you first came into breakfast, when I saw you -- I thought you were handsome... Then, of course, you spoke... So now that your soft li'l underbelly is all exposed. Tell me, why did you bring me?
MELVIN: Well, ah... that's a personal question.
CAROL: Tell me even if you're scared. Tell me why you wanted me here. It's okay.
CAROL: If you ask me... I'll say, yes.""
MELVIN: There are lots of reason... I had a thought that if you had sex with Simon it might...
CAROL: Sex with Simon?
MELVIN: It's one idea...
CAROL: That's why you brought me? Look at me! Is that really why you brought me... Like I'm a what and I owe you what?!
MELVIN: I don't know why I brought you -- that idea occurred to me is all... It came out first... Hey, you kiss him -- me... He says he loves you. You two hit it off. But you don't want to... fine... Forget what I said about sex with Simon. It was a mistake.
CAROL: I'll never forget you said it.
MELVIN: It was a mistake.
