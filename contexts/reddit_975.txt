Does anyone else keep thinking about and over-analyzing humiliating events from 10+ years ago?
I recently had a (sort of sudden) realization that everyone would make fun of me in High School, with me being the joke and the only one not knowing what was going on (even the teacher was in on it...). These moments were ongoing and humiliating - I would almost always play into the joke too. 

I never thought I was popular, but I never realized how big of a loser I was during those years. All of the people who pretended to be my friend were actually making fun of me. I graduated high school over 10 years ago and have become a self-supporting adult now, but still struggle with self esteem. Nonetheless, I'm not sure why this suddenly bothers me. Since HS, I had a pretty successful time in college and am doing well in my career, but still keep going back to these HS thoughts. Has anyone else had this happen, or have any advice?
