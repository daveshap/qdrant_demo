Short story about a wrong phone number which turns out to be the number of someone in another timeline I remember reading a story about some guy who makes a phone call and is connected to someone he doesn't know. They agree to meet, but can't find each other at the agreed meeting place. When they speak on the phone again, it turns out they are living in different time lines, one in which there has been a war, and another where there hasn't. If memory serves in the end they are reluctant to hang up for fear of never getting to speak to each other again.
