What do I do when my temp recruiter does not respond for my inquiries to move to a new job?
I have been temping with the same company for well  over two years. The assigned company will not hire me full time. They also do not want me to leave either and have been telling me for a while that a new job will eventually pop up for me to apply to. Because of this I've asked my recruiter if I can change jobs and she refused to respond to my requests. Do recruiters not want you to leave your placement?
