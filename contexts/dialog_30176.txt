KEATON: The answer is no.
KOBAYASHI: Mr. Soze will be most -
KEATON: Listen to me, cocksucker. There is no Keyser Sate. If you say his name again, I'11 kill you right here.
KOBAYASHI: A strange threat. I can only assume you're here to kill me anyway. Pity about Mr. Redfoot.
KOBAYASHI: Ahh, Mr. Hockney. Do join us.
KEATON: We know you can get to us, and now you know we can get to you. I'm offering you the chance to call this off.
KOBAYASHI: Mr. So- My employer has made up his mind. He does not change it.
KEATON: Neither do we.
