A Little Paranoid I Might Be Pregnant
so as soon as i (f16) got a boyfriend (m17) my parents put me on birth control (depo shot) understandably me and him decided to stop using condoms since they were giving me a weird allergic reaction (probably the spermicide on them) every time we had sex.

so i got the shot around the beginning of october, and there was only one time when he didn’t pull out because being put on the birth control was giving me some nasty emotional and physical side effects so i wanted to take full advantage of it. this was november 29th

so even before that ive been spotting on and off for about 3 weeks (it lets up a little sometimes and we manage to be able to do stuff when it does) and only after the 29th did it start getting heavy. I’ve been eating a lot more and i’ve gained 8 lbs (weight gain and spotting are side effects of the bc). im extremely paranoid that i might be pregnant even though theres about a 1% chance that i am... my parents are very religious and i wouldn’t be able to get an abortion. my mind wont stop thinking about it, i need some reassurance. help?
