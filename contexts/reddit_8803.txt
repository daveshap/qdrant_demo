In light of the [recent death of Jeffrey Epstein while in custody at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/13/nyregion/jeffrey-epstein-jail-officers.html), the operations of the Bureau of Prisons have come under [bipartisan scrutiny](https://www.axios.com/house-judiciary-jeffrey-epstein-investigation-1d95b753-a832-45e2-81d8-0783dd5d753d.html).

The [Metropolitan Correction Center of New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Correctional_Center,_New_York) is a federal detention facility that is operated by the [Federal Bureau of Prisons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Prisons), which in turn is operated by the [U.S. Department of Justice.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice)

> The analysis found that the federal prison system lost 12 percent of its workforce from the start of the Trump administration through the end of 2018. Administration officials have argued that the staff drop, which resulted partly from a hiring freeze, was mitigated by a reduction in the number of federal prisoners. But the drop in Bureau of Prisons (BOP) staff was nearly double the rate of decline in the prison population overall, the analysis found.
