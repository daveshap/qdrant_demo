Looking for advice on a particular infraction
In case it makes a difference my job is in NYC.

Long story short, out company uses paid time off hours for any time you come in late or leave early. They add it using a google form you fill out. On one particular day I left early, told mgmt but forgot to hit submit on the form, def my mistake but bc of that I am now receiving an infraction.

Now, thing is, I reviewed the attendance policy throughly. For latenesses it specifically states that the form must be filled out “before end of shift.” For leaving early though it says “any timeframe.” Only thing is there is no way to indicate on the google form you’re doing it for a day prior so you muss add it manually which I did the next day. So given that the verbiage isn’t specific about when PTO must be added, do you think it’s worth going to HR? Any advice is appreciated
