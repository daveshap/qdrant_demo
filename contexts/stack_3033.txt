Hawking Radiation from a Physical Black Hole For distant observer, a physical black hole takes an infinite amount of time collapse, because time is redshifted near the Schwarzchild radius. Instead of the matter crossing the horizon, it will just pancake closer and closer to the $r_s$, without ever forming a horizon. On the other hand, Hawking's derivation relies on the existence of a bona fide horizon. Can the horizon radiate before it even exists?
