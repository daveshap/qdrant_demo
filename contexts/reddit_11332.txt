Just something I need too get off my chest
So going back 3 years I was a happy, confident, fun loving person. I always had a joke, rarely ever got upset. I was however incredibly overweight and a size 20. Something needed to be done and I decided that losing weight was something I desperately needed to do. So I didn't look back- joined a gym, restricted my calories and ate clean. 1 year later and I'd lost 4 stone 56 pounds and at around a size. I felt great, compliments were flying, people no longer called me fat. I had relationship offers from people I'd never have expected. 

Being a food lover I piled a stone and a half back on and felt crap again. I could feel myself spiralling out of control back to my fat self. I decided to diet again and I again restricted calories and started exercising once more.

Right fast forward 1 year and my total weight loss is 70lbs and I'm a size 6-8. It has its ups, I grt looks walking down the street, quite a few people have shown interest and I hace a lovely boyfriend that has stuck by me throughout my weight loss.
However I am totally not happy. I can't drink with my friends as I am to scared of the calories which will make me gain weight. People think I am boring now and the truth is it's true. I can no longer be that bubbly person, I don't have the energy for it.
I hate food, it's my best friend and my worst enemy. I'vw always loved cakes and sweets and seeing everyone else eat them is a struggle.
My family aren't exactly supportive and I have done this all on my own.

I am constantly cold due to being now. People are always moaning that all I ever talk about is calories and exercise but it has become my life.

I am aware this is obsessive and I wish I could change it. However the thought of gaining weight puts me in a state of panic and I know that I will be stuck in this dilema for the rest of my life.

Thanks for reading.
