MARISOL: Steve called for you.
PILAR: Steve?
MARISOL: Steve. Board of Education Steve who likes you? He goes for us hot-blooded Mexican girls, I can tell.
PILAR: Spanish, please. My mother would have a heart attack.
MARISOL: Your mother's family is Spanish?
PILAR: Sure, they go back to Cortez. When he rode by, they were squatting in a hut cooking hamsters for dinner.
MARISOL: You got to be interested in somebody. All you do is work.
PILAR: All my mother does is work. That's how you get to be Spanish.
MARISOL: How 'bout the Sheriff?
PILAR: The Sheriff.
MARISOL: The old-high-school-heartthrob Sheriff. I thought you were crazy about each other. He's available, you're available--
PILAR: I'm unmarried. I'm not available.
MARISOL: You told me one time it was true love.
