NICOLET: ...Compton with a fifty-six-year- old petty thief -- woman named Simone Hawkins.
NICOLET: Ever meet her, or they talk about her?
JACKIE: Not yet.
NICOLET: Who's the other one?
JACKIE: White girl named Melanie Ralston. Another girlfriend of Ordell's.
NICOLET: What's her story?
JACKIE: It was her coke I got busted with. She knows everything, but she's not part of it, and she's pissed cause she's not part of it. Ordell wouldn't even let her stay at the meeting. She tried to talk me into ripping off Ordell.
NICOLET: And splittin' with her?
JACKIE: I'm sure that was the idea.
NICOLET: What did you say?
JACKIE: I smiled and walked away. She also told me Ordell killed Beaumont.
NICOLET: She told you that?
JACKIE: Uh-huh.
NICOLET: Was she there?
JACKIE: She didn't say.
NICOLET: But she mentioned Beaumont by name?
JACKIE: Uh-huh.
NICOLET: Well, this sounds like a lady I'd like to have a word with. So everything's set for tomorrow?
JACKIE: Right. Everything's the same, except one change...
JACKIE: I told them Ordell's changed the amount he's bringing in.
MAX: Do you think they bought it?
JACKIE: Oh, yeah. I got them thinking Ordell's real nervous. They love thinking he's scared of them.
MAX: You know, a good cop won't let you know he knows you're fulla shit.
JACKIE: All he needed was a reasonable explanation.
