I'm here if you want to talk
 

Just here to tell that if you ever feel low or just want to talk about sometime weird in your mind I'm here to listen and respond accordingly

I'm a very good listener and can provide you with some tips as I've also passes my share of bad times

I'm bad at holding conversations at the start because I'm shy but slowly and steadily it might grow into wonderful friendship

I'm also available if you want to talk random shit or discuss something serious

I'm an atheist so all religions are all right for me and I respect them all .

I'm not very good at starting a conversation but can surely continue one . So don't be shy and PM me and I'll respond ASAP

I post this frequently so more people know about this

If you read this long , you should PM me
