How okay is it to tell your friends outside of work that your company is about to lay people off?
My job just announced that they are cutting employee costs to be more aligned with “competitors” and that we have like two weeks to sign up for a severance agreement...or else.

Seems like maybe it might be good to talk to some people outside of work, since everyone at work is on pins and needles and scared out of their minds and of course management is tight-lipped.
