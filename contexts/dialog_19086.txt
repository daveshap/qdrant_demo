NAPOLEON: And, what a great pleasure it is, indeed, to meet you, Alexander.
ALEXANDER: And, what a delightful idea!
NAPOLEON: Ah -- you approve?
ALEXANDER: I think it's absolutely charming.
NAPOLEON: I'm glad you like it.
ALEXANDER: Whatever suggested the idea to you?
NAPOLEON: I shall tell you in the strictest confidence -- when I was a boy, I had a passion for rafts, and never had the opportunity to build one.
