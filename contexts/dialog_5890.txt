GITTES: That dam is a con job.
EVELYN: What dam?
GITTES: The one your husband opposed. They're conning L.A. into building it, only the water won't go to L.A. It'll go here.
EVELYN: The Valley?
GITTES: Everything you can see, everything around us. I was at the Hall of Records today. That bother you?
EVELYN: No.
GITTES: In the last three months, Robert Knox has bought 7,000 acres, Emma Dill 12,000 acres, Clarence Speer 5,000 acres, and Jasper Lamar Crabb 25,000 acres.
EVELYN: Jasper Lamar Crabb?
GITTES: Know him?
EVELYN: No, I think I'd remember.
GITTES: Yeah. They've been blowing these farmers out of here and buying their land for peanuts. Have any idea what this land'll be worth with a steady water supply? About thirty million more than they paid.
EVELYN: And Hollis knew about it?
GITTES: It's why he was killed. Jasper Lamar Crabb. Jasper Lamar Crabb.
GITTES: We got it. We got it, baby.
EVELYN: What? What is it?
GITTES: There was a memorial service at the Mar Vista Inn today for Jasper Lamar Crabb. He died three weeks ago.
EVELYN: Is that unusual?
GITTES: Two weeks ago he bought those 25,000 acres. That's unusual.
