OLIVER: He complained of not feeling well. I thought he was drunk ——	he staggered.
ALBRECHT: That staggering. His dying so quickly. In your campaigns, have you never seen men who staggered before they died, who talked incoherently —— walked blindly.
GENERAL: I've seen men die drunk —- and I've seen men die of the plague.
OLIVER: Plague? There's no possibility of that, is there?
GENERAL: The rider on the pale horse is Pestilence. He follows the wars.
ALBRECHT: I'm not sure that it is the plague.
GENERAL: We will know when the next one sickens. Until then you and I remain here. I will not bring the plague to my troops.
ALBRECHT: In the meantime it would be useless to alarm the others. Let them think it was a normal And, perhaps it was —- perhaps it was.
CATHY: I'm glad you and the General didn't have to leave us. We would feel quite deserted..
OLIVER: How could we go back to the wars with such pleasant company here..
CATHY: Thank you.
