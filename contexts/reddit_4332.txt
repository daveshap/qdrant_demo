I just read about a poor little 10 year old boy who committed suicide because he was bullied and I ask all of you to please keep him in your thoughts because he was one of us.
This morning, I read about a little boy who has had more than 26 surgeries and had to carry a colostomy bag around with him. 

Kids at his school bullied him almost daily because of it, often going as far as assaulting him and yelling racial slurs at him. 

His family said he often prayed for his bullies and never fought back when they attacked him.  

Well, he hung himself, a 10 year old boy knew how to hang himself. This poor little innocent child will never see what a beautiful life he had ahead of him because his bullies thought it was so hilarious to attack something he could not control.

We are all in this sub reddit because we have faced, are facing depression, pain, mental disorders. Some of us may have faced bullies in our lives. And those “bullies” are all facing problems of their own causing them to lash out at others. And unfortunately, they are causing so much pain for those who do not deserve it.

So today, I am asking all of you to please keep this little boy in your thoughts because he was one of us, and unfortunately the pain was too much for his innocent soul. If any of you are facing problems that you feel are too big for you to handle. Please seek help. Reach out to those around you because I would not be here today if I didn’t make the decision to seek help.
