FLETCH: You decorate this yourself or did Mrs. Chief of Police help you?
CUMMINGS: You should have seen what she wanted to do with the place. Mauve. So what's your name?
FLETCH: Fletch.
CUMMINGS: Full name.
FLETCH: Fletch F. Fletch
CUMMINGS: I see. And what do you do for a living, Mr. Fletch?
FLETCH: I'm President of the International Fletch Corporation.
CUMMINGS: Why are you doing this Mr. Fletch?
FLETCH: Frankly sir, you look a little like my father. Probably explains the curious feeling of love I have for you.
CUMMINGS: For a gentleman who was just found holding a bag full of heroin...
FLETCH: It was planted on me, sir.
CUMMINGS: We're looking at five years, maybe ten. Is that what you want... Jane Doe?
CUMMINGS: Your editor called me yesterday to respond to allegations you're about to print about police involvement in narcotics dealing. Fletch starts to get up, but Cummings plants his foot on Fletch's chest, forces him back down.
CUMMINGS: I'm about to break that beach wide open, and I don't need some pennyante Woodward and Bernstein getting in the way of my men.
FLETCH: 'Your men' might just be involved in all this.
CUMMINGS: You idiot. Off the record, deep background: I've got that beach crawling with undercover cops.
