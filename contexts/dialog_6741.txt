JACK: Three years, two months. March '93.
GILES: What a memory you've got. Maths always was your strong suit. What happened to the moaning Lisa?
JACK: She went back to South Africa.
GILES: Did she? You were pretty thick at one time.
JACK: We all played the field.
GILES: Hi-ya... I'll call you back. Now then...
JACK: I want a job, Giles.
GILES: All right. As what?
JACK: I was thinking perhaps I could be a reader. You employ readers, don't you?
GILES: We do. For unsolicited manuscripts. We pay twenty pounds a manuscript. You might get two, maybe three in a week. Can you live on sixty pounds?
