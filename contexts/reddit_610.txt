How can I earn some money for myself
So I (13F) am going on a class trip to Costa Rica this year. Next year my school has a trip to Greece, which is my dream vacation destination. I would love to go but 2 international trips back to back is not something my family can afford. My mother said I can go, but only if I can earn some of the money for myself. I am a straight A student and would potentially be interested in tutoring but not sure how to get started or even if I could make much money from tutoring. Are there any other ways I could earn money to go on the trip? I can play play piano and a little flute but I don’t have either of these instruments anymore. I did dance for many years but I don’t think I’m good enough to teach. Aside from my smarts I don’t really have any talents so I’m not exactly sure how I could earn money. I have been selling crochet and macrame work that I do but it’s not making enough money for me to put a lot of time into it.
