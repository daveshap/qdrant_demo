ALEXANDER: Emma actually likes chalk dust -- says it smells like me.
PHILBY: How romantic...
PHILBY: The most able inventor I know and you can't tie a simple four-in- hand.
ALEXANDER: That's how I knew we were destined to be together. When I met her parents for the first time I came right from class and I was covered in chalk. They sniffed and snorted, but she just smiled. At that moment -- I just knew. How did you know with Molly?
PHILBY: She made the best Shepherd's pie I ever tasted.
ALEXANDER: Do you have a romantic bone in your body?
PHILBY: No, I'm all bowler hat, remember?
PHILBY: Alex, really... good luck tonight. She's a fine girl, and she's done wonderful things for you.
ALEXANDER: Oh?
PHILBY: She's gotten into your equations.
