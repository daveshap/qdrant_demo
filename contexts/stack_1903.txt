Word for common knowledge in a scientific setting? I remember there being a single word to represent currently accepted facts in a scientific discipline. Common knowledge, but in a scientific setting. It is a jargon-y sounding word.You'd use it when mentioning an accepted theory or concept that may be unfamiliar to a reader, but is common enough that you don't need to prove or cite it yourself.The case I'm trying to use it in is like this:<blockquote>  ...important to note that this study is not on the existence of the bias as it is _______, but rather the failure of subjects to account for it...</blockquote>I'd like to emphasize that I'm looking for a single word. I may be misremembering it, but I am pretty certain there is one word that fits this description.
