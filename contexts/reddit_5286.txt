Just got warned I’ll get a “talking to” about leaving 15 minutes early the past few days.
So the vp saw me head to my car early a few days ago as he was was leaving early and apparently he talked to my supervisor about it and that i will be spoken to, but my supervisor said she doesn’t care at all because no one does work that past 15 min of the day. 

I left due to construction on the route home and i already have a 50 mile commute and traffic turns it into 2 hours. 

Can I go in defensive or is it better to kiss ass and apologize?
