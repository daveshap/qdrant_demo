Anyone else going to miss the part of them that could have been so great?
The real part of yourself. The part that had dreams and ambitions. The part that dreamt of meeting someone you could fall in love with. The part that used to get comfort from things so simple such as showering, sleeping and eating your favourite foods. Maybe movies, tv shows or sports that made you feel alive and hopeful. The innocent part, now buried by the pain inflicted by your mind. This is not a post of optimism, more just typing what floats in my complex mind.

I think we all knew the potential we once had, and could not imagine things to flip so unfairly. Some recover, others don’t. Others endure the pain knowing they can never break free but accepting it. Some can’t end their lives due to the pain, others can more easily. 
I used to think I wouldn’t miss living if I died. 

But I don’t think that’s true. I would miss the part of me buried deep within. Not the part swarmed by all these mental illnesses, but the part of me that was inclusive, kind and dreamy. Realism is a terrible thing for people suffering, with no indication of improvement. And the way hope plays on your mind and pulls you back, can be a terrible thing too. Do not let hope control your life. Personally, no matter how comforting hope can be, it has a harmful agenda in the long run. What if the hoping never ends.
