How to track changes between nightly MySQL database dumps I work with three MySQL databases (a, b &amp; c) on a single server, that are nightly dumps of production databases. I have a fourth database (d) on that same server, that I have been given for creating new tables that connect and synthesize data from databases a, b &amp; c.I need to begin creating reports that reflect changes in databases a, b &amp; c from one nightly dump to the next.What would be the best way to capture the records from databases a, b &amp; c, into database d, that:example 1: records all of the unique records in tonight's dump that were not found in the last night's dump. (e.g. new account numbers in a table)example 2: records all of the changes in value for records in tonight's dump that were different in last night's dump. (e.g. an account_status value that changes from 1 to 0).I am new to data work and am hoping to find resources and direction on what the best practices are for such things?Many thanks!
