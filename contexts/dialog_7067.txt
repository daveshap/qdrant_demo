LOGAN: You're a thief?
MAX: Girl's gotta make a living.
LOGAN: Thank God.
MAX: First time I ever heard that.
LOGAN: I was expecting someone else.
MAX: Guess it wasn't the pizza delivery guy.
LOGAN: You're lucky. I almost pulled the trigger.
MAX: I'm sorry if I caught you at a bad time.
LOGAN: We're just a little tense right now... It's okay.
LOGAN: You have good taste. French, 1920's, attributed to Chitarus.
MAX: Whoever that is.
LOGAN: So, what, you liked it because it was shiny?
MAX: No, because it's the Egyptian goddess Bast.
LOGAN: Who is...
MAX: The goddess who comprehends all goddesses, eye of Ra, protector, avenger, and destroyer, giver of life, who lives forever... I could keep going.
