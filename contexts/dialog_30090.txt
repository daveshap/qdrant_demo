ENGLISH BOB: Why, if you were to point a pistol at a King or a Queen, sir, I can assure you your hand would shake as though palsied...
BARBER: I wouldn't point no pistol at nobody, sir.
ENGLISH BOB: A wise policy. But if you did, I can assure you, the sight of royalty would cause you to dismiss all thoughts of bloodshed and stand... in awe. Whereas, a president... I mean, why not shoot a president?
ENGLISH BOB: Now this Strawberry Alice person, tell me again.
BARBER: Down the street and across. Greely's Beer Garden and Billiard parlor. Just ask for Alice and say you want a game of billiards.
ENGLISH BOB: Billiards, eh? Even though I don't really wish to play?
BARBER: Don't matter. They burned the table in '78 for firewood.
ENGLISH BOB: Ah, I see.
