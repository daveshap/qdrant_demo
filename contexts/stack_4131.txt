Flying from Stockholm to Paris via Istanbul with French National ID Card Since I won't have my French passport, I'll have to fly from Stockholm (ARN) to Paris (CDG) via Istanbul (IST) with my French National ID card. I called the Swedish police and Turkish Airlines who said it should be fine, but they seemed confused by my question, I am not sure they understood it, and I'm not sure the staff (both at the boarding gate, and at police check) at Stockholm Arlanda airport will agree anyway. Anyone with such experience at Arlanda airport, documented opinion, or advice? Thanks
