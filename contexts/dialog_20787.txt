ANDREW: I have too much work to do. Skip the treatment.
MIGUEL: We're not skipping this treatment.
ANDREW: I said, skip it, Michael. It's my treatment.

ANDREW: What's wrong with you?
MIGUEL: Close the law book.
ANDREW: I'm not going to close the--
MIGUEL: CLOSE THE FUCKING LAW BOOK!

ANDREW: You don't think there's much time left, do you?
MIGUEL: That's not what I said.
ANDREW: You're scared. You think we're near the end.
MIGUEL: No.
ANDREW: Maybe I should start making plans, is that what you think? Start planning my memorial service? Begin to prepare for the inevitable.""

ANDREW: I'm not going to die.
MIGUEL: That's right. We're on the Positive Plan. You don't have a Fatal Disease, you have Manageable Illness.
ANDREW: You want me to give up? Let this thing turn us into <u>victims</u>?
MIGUEL: Then, what <u>are</u> we, Drew?! The <u>winners</u>? Ladies and gentlemen
ANDREW: I'm not ready to die.
MIGUEL: Do you think I'm ready for it?! I hate this shit. I'm not a fucking martyr! I hate every goddamn part of it!
