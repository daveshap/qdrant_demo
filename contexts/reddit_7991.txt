Let’s talk debt
How much debt is manageable for a lucrative career that you love? I enrolled in a private masters program (only one in the area my husband works at, non-negotiable) and we are young, frugal, and have no kids. I have worked so hard for this and plan to pay off student loans as fast as possible. No other debt for either of us and he covers our living expenses. Anyone else have similar circumstances and come out on the other side? Hoping for some positivity or advice, I know that debt can be crippling but I know there’s also lots of people that have buckled down and paid off loans years early.
