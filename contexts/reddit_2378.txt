Anyone else get annoyed with Linkden? (Rant)
It's a great resource for finding jobs and networking, but it seems so fake to me. 

Example: someone posts something like - Today, my salary was reduced by half my pay, and based on where we are with COVID, I was not upset. I pushed my team, blah, blah, blah. Such BULLSHIT, right?! No one is okay with making less. 

Example2: someone worked 6 months at a role which they had no experience in prior - generated this, consulted that, and managed 200,000 whatever, whatever, fake! 

It just seems like such a fake place to try and make yourself look good. It's adult show and tell about their careers, which is fine, but so many 'fakish' profiles and douchebags. 

In a way, it's maybe upsetting because I'm more humble and will post simple - 4 years at x company working in x area managing x, y & z. 

Thoughts? Maybe I'm the douchebag.
