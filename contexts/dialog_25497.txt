PICARD: Counselor.
DEANNA: Do you have a moment, sir?
PICARD: Of course, sit down.
DEANNA: It's about Data I've watched him with the B-9 and I'm troubled. Data's desire for a family" is very strong. I'm afraid he may be investing too much in the B-9."
PICARD: You're speaking of emotional investment?
DEANNA: The B-9 is like a slow child, sir. And Data, in his own way, has assumed the position of a parent or guardian. I'm afraid he has expectations based on his own experiences. He'll be disappointed when the BI-9 cannot meet those expectations.
PICARD: As much as we care for him, Deanna... we have to remember that Data isn't capable of disappointment.
DEANNA: I don't believe that, sir. Weâ€™ve shared many disappointing journeys.
PICARD: I'm going to miss you.
DEANNA: And I you.
RIKER: Captain, you have an Alpha Priority communication from Starfleet Command.
PICARD: Acknowledged ... ...I'll talk to Data.
