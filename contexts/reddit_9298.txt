Get a Roommate!
Anyone else tired of this cookie cutter advice from the wealthy to the wealthy? It's like a revelation to them. Like, "wow, what a brilliant idea. What a way to hack the system! I'll get a roommate and I'll have so much more disposable income!" Or better yet, "Buy a duplex and rent out the other unit so you can live rent free!"

I'm living in an office with no closet in a house with three other roommates and two dogs and two cats. I'm 30 minutes out of town and 45 minutes from work, but this is the rent I can afford.
