My cat is sexually frustrated and I can really sympathise.
I (28F) haven't been very successful with dating recently and apart from being frustrated about not being in a relationship, the lack of sex is driving me nuts. I have a high sex drive, and while I haven't been in a proper relationship for 5 years I somehow managed to have longer dating phases or FWBs, so at least I got some quite regularly. Now my last 9 months thing fizzled out in December, and since then it's been dry. I hardly get to know new interesting people where I am, and I suck at OLD. So I had ONE date this year, resulting in nothing as the guy started seeing someone else (no hard feelings).
A few weeks ago I adopted a cat. I got one from a family who couldn't afford keeping her, she hasn't been chipped or fixed. And now that poor thing went into heat and is crying for sex. She is crawling through the flat holding her butt up hoping some male cat comes along and notices her. She's longing for affection and making such desperate noises. This is exactly how I feel inside. 
Lucky her, she's getting spayed next week and won't care anymore. I will have to continue this lonely life.

Edit: this is just a (slightly amusing I think) vent, I don't need advice on dating. I only have sex with guys I have a connection with and am attracted to.

Edit2: just adding, I am not looking for a FWB, and this is just a post having a laugh about me and my cat both missing out on sex.
