GIBBONS: Most guys we ran through this either took off or helped them rob the place. I expected you to do the same.
XANDER: That shows me already that you don't have a clue. What's it to you, anyway?
GIBBONS: Whether you thought this was for real or not, you jumped in and helped the waitress on instinct. That tells me something about your character.
XANDER: Good for you. Now why don't you stop wasting my time and tell me what you want. You didn't go through all this for my benefit.
GIBBONS: It's your lucky day. You just might get the chance to pay back our wonderful country for all the freedom you enjoy.
XANDER: A Fed, I shoulda known. Who else would have this kind of budget? Now you're gonna hit me with the sales pitch.
GIBBONS: Alright, Cage, you've got me. This is one of those moments. Many are called
XANDER: ..If you're trolling around for narcs, man, have you got the wrong guy.
GIBBONS: Why is that?
XANDER: Look at me, dude, do I look like a fan of law enforcement? Forget the tests, you shoulda just asked me. I woulda saved you a lot of trouble.
GIBBONS: Oh I don't know, I think the tests work pretty well. Sometimes they give me answers you wouldn't admit to in a million years.
XANDER: Are we done now? You've got nothing on me. So if you ain't booking me, I'm walking.
GIBBONS: You've got this wrong. You're not under arrest, you've been abducted. And until I say different, you belong to me.
XANDER: Is that a fact?
GIBBONS: Sure as gravity. I've had a feeling about you from the start, Cage. It's nausea.
XANDER: You know what I hate? Any scumbag with a clean shirt and a bad haircut can get one of those tin stars and suddenly they think they're God.
GIBBONS: You know what I hate? It's always the assholes that pass the tests.
