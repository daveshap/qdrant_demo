JEZZIE: This is one of my dreams, Jake. Ever since I was a little girl. I never thought it would happen.
JACOB: Stick with me, kid.
JEZZIE: I want to go with you, Jake. Wherever you go.
JACOB: It's not practical, Jez. It'll be hard enough alone.
JEZZIE: I can waitress. I'm good.
JACOB: No. Things are too hot. Later. I'll send for you.
JEZZIE: Bullshit!
JACOB: I promise.
JEZZIE: Please.
JACOB: No. I'm a marked man, Jez. I'm the only one left. I don't want to expose you to that. It's not right for you or me. Be reasonable.
JEZZIE: Reasonable? Reasonable? Jake ... You're gettin' me angry.
JACOB: I love you when you're angry.
JEZZIE: Oh yeah? Try leavin' without me.
