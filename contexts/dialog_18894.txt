BOY: Excuse me I asked you a question.
VADA: I'm not supposed to talk to strangers, not even nuns.
BOY: You're Vada right?
VADA: How did you know my name?
BOY: Your Uncle Phil told me.
VADA: Where is he?? He was supposed to meet me.
BOY: Hey relax, you think I kidnapped him or something?
VADA: This is California, anything is possible.
BOY: Well if I was looking for a victim, I definitely wouldn't pick your Uncle Phil who outweighs me by about 150 pounds, besides, who would I ask for ransom? You??
VADA: Are you suffering from a chemical imbalance or is it just an attitude problem.
BOY: My only problem is that your Uncle Phil is giving me five bucks to pick you up but I don't get paid 'till delivery.
VADA: Gee, that is a problem.
VADA: Put that down, I'll...I'll call the police!
BOY: What are you gonna do? Tell them that...a polite person helped carry your bag?
VADA: I don't think you're very polite.
BOY: Yeah, well I don't think you're very grateful. A lot of people in your position would say &quot;thank you&quot;.
VADA: THANK YOU.
BOY: Don't mention it.
VADA: I don't even know your name.
