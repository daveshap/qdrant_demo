Delayed start due to onboarding procedures - did I mess up?
I’m a nervous wreck worrying my job offer will be rescinded. I signed the offer 2 weeks ago and am now trying to complete onboarding stuff. 

I had to complete some physical assessments and get labs done. I realized that I hadn’t been offered one of the tests although I had discussed it with employee health and safety. I notified EHS of this immediately, hoping my start date would not be delayed. When I went in to do the test, and they told me I need to get  a vaccine due to my lab results, which I can’t do until after my planned start date. I spoke to my manger about delaying my start date a few days and received an email from HR today confirming the delay. Does this reflect badly on me? I’m not sure if this is my fault or just EHS being slow during the coronavirus. 

Another issue - made an error on my BG check (listed a company’s name and phone # instead of a reference on the app). Asked BG company if they could update the reference and they said yes, but they ended up marking it as unable to complete. A long time intermittent independent contracting position I have also showed up as unable to complete. Is this going to screw me even worse? I can easily explain both incompletions and provide proof, but HR hasn’t mentioned it yet. Should I bring it up?
