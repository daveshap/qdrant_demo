GRAHAM: Do you think that's such a good idea?
ANN: Don't you want to make one?
GRAHAM: Yes. But I sense the element of revenge here.
ANN: What difference does it make why I do it?
GRAHAM: I want you to be aware of what you're doing and why, because I know that this is not the sort of thing you would do in a normal frame of mind.
ANN: What would you know about a normal frame of mind?
GRAHAM: That's a good question.
ANN: What do you have to do to get ready?
GRAHAM: Load a new tape, turn the camera on.
ANN: Then do it.
ANN: How do you pay for all this? I mean, rent, and tapes and this equipment.
GRAHAM: I have money.
ANN: What will you do when the money runs out?
GRAHAM: It won't. Are you ready?
ANN: Yes.
GRAHAM: Tell me your name.
ANN: Ann Bishop Millaney.
JOHN: Jesus Christ! What the hell happened? I came home and your car was gone, the door was open, I thought for sure you'd been abducted by some mad fucker, I was literally just calling the cops when you walked in. What happened?
ANN: I want out of this marriage.
JOHN: What?
ANN: I want out of this marriage.
JOHN: Why?
ANN: We'll call it uncontested or whatever. I just want out.
