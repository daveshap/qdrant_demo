First month in sales position, how do I really impress during the 3 month probation?
The company is big but my branch is TINY (5 people).  That being said I really like the company, and I love my coworkers.  It's a brand new industry for me, and it's surprisingly interesting and exciting.  I am one of 2 sales reps, but they might be hiring an additional one in the next few months because they want to ramp up sales efforts.


I made short, eye-catching brochures to give to customers.  I even went so far as to make multiple versions that are industry specific.  I will even try and update them to be tailored to a specific customer if they ask us for information.

Trouble is we aren't getting a lot of requests for information from customers, and I'm not really being given any tasks to do yet because I'm 3 weeks in, so I always ask my coworker for advice, or ask him questions about how things are done, etc.

I have a lot of free time at my desk so I take notes, I research potential and current customers, and  I try to read up on the industry, but I'm still so bored I want to fall asleep at my desk because there's no challenge.

What should I do?
