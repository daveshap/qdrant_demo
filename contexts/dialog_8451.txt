ERIN: I mean, it's not a problem or anything, but -- I'm just a little unclear on what those things are. I thought maybe you'd know.
JANE: What do I look like, Erin? A library?
ROSALIND: Masry & Vititoe, can I help you?
ERIN: Hi, Rosalind, this is Erin. Brockovich. From the file room? I was wondering if you could tell Mr. Masry that I'm following up on that real estate thing out of the office.
ERIN: Dr. Paulsen?
PAULSEN: Yes?
ERIN: Hi, I'm Erin Brockovich. I was just over in the library there, asking a mess of questions about -- I guess they call it epidemiology? -- and the fella there told me to find you, cause you know all about it.
PAULSEN: Is this a joke? Did Baxter put you up to this?
ERIN: Who's Baxter?
PAULSEN: He did, didn't he? <u>Baxter</u>!
