ALEXANDER: I mean it. I know your work record. You were in line for foreman when this trouble started -- did you know that? You had a real future with this company, but you let those Reds stir you up. And now they'll sell you down the river. Why don't you wake up, Ray? That's your name, isn't it, Ray?
RAMÓN: No. My name is Quintero. Mister Quintero.
ALEXANDER: Are you going to let us pass -- or do I have to call the Sheriff?
RAMÓN: There's nothing stopping you.
