XANDER: If you got a problem with me, why are we dancing?
PETRA: Yorgi asked me to.
XANDER: You do everything Yorgi says?
PETRA: Go to hell.
XANDER: It's gonna be like that, huh? You got all bent out of shape as soon as he started dancing with someone else. Why's that?
PETRA: Mind your business.
XANDER: Did you guys used to date? That's it, right? He broke your heart and you're still soft on him. That's funny, it don't seem to fit with a tough broad like you.
XANDER: Where are you going?
PETRA: Why are you still hanging around? Your business is finished, you should go home.
XANDER: I was invited. What's your story?
PETRA: I don't know who you are or where you come from, but I don't like you. You ask too many questions.
XANDER: Come on, don't front like that. You'll put a guy right off you.
PETRA: Don't even bother, X man, I'm not your type.
XANDER: That right? Why's that?
