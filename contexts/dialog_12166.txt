PENELOPE: All right! Am I exceedingly dangerous now?
HAROLD: The National Safety Council would be appalled.
PENELOPE: Then listen to me. You're both disgusting--with your pride, your pride. I hate you for coming here--like a federal marshal in a western film. I loved you when you stayed away. But here you are now--high noon in the Superbowl! You fool, you fool.
WOODLY: Everything's going to be beautiful.
PENELOPE: You fake! You're no better than the dumbest general in the Pentagon. You're not going to beat Harold. You're not going to beat anybody. You're not going to stay here, either--yammering and taunting until you're most gloriously killed. Go home!
HAROLD: She's right, Norbert--go home. WOODLY I haven't said all I have to say.
PENELOPE: Out!
WOODLY: I haven't told you, Harold, how comical I think you are.
HAROLD: Comical?
