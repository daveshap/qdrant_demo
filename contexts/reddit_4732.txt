I sent a message to my father...
On 6th February, 2019 at 4:47am I watched my father take his last breath on his bedroom floor of my childhood home. To say that things moved on quickly is a severe understatement. Right now, it's 3:35am and I have been awake for the last 95 mins just wanting to hear my father's voice. To know that all that I'm doing for my own family is enough; that I'm not a failure as a son or as a husband or father. Sure, my wife tells me that I'm not a failure, but it's not the same. I just want to hear my father's reassurance one more time.

I can't find a voicemail or a video. Not a single one and it's crushing me more and more. So I sent him a message on facebook since I know his cell phone is long disconnected and his number more than likely recycled. I'm sure my mother will read this as she is the one that has taken over his account since his passing, but I just really want to hear something attached to his name or his face right now.

I'm sorry if this isn't the proper place for things, my mind has travelled back to that morning when I was getting ready for work and I get a phone call that something has happened to my father and that I should get there quickly... Sometimes I wish that I could be more open about these feelings with my own spouse or those close to me rather than random strangers on the internet, but I still feel like I need to be the strong one. Not only for my two children, but for my 5 older siblings and our mother as well.
