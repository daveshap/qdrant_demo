DARYL: Well, we worked on the school paper together. I remember when the Legion of Decency declared Rebel without a Cause unfit...boy...that Jim Backers, what an actor uh? What an actor.
VADA: Wow, you walked out with my mother?
DARYL: You kidding? he picks up a picture and shows Vada and Nick
NICK: You saved a lot of lives, you should be very proud.
VADA: Umm, I'm trying to find out her greatest achievement.
DARYL: She was the uhh...first girl ever suspended for smoking.
VADA: Suspended from school, my mother??
DARYL: Everyone was really surprised when Maggie was turned in, she got kicked out for two weeks.
NICK: What kind of sleazoid geek would turn her in?
DARYL: I would do it again in a minute.
VADA: You ratted on my mother??
NICK: Who are you? Hitler's hall monitor?
DARYL: Well maybe you should join a hippie commune. But let me tell you something. Sooner or later it's gonna be your turn to take out the garbage.
