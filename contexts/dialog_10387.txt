EUGENE: Who died?
JEROME: The Mission Director.
EUGENE: You wish.
JEROME: They found him in his office this morning-- beaten so bad they had to check his nametag.
EUGENE: What an act of benevolence--a service to the community. So that's it. Now there's nothing between you and ignition.
JEROME: He was still warm when they confirmed.
EUGENE: This calls for a celebration. Doesn't it?
JEROME: The place is crawling with Hoovers.
EUGENE: So what? You didn't kill him, did you?
JEROME: That's not the point.
EUGENE: Hey, how much of you can be there? Even if the J. Edgars" do find something
JEROME: You're going to have to earn your supper. I've got my final physical tomorrow.
