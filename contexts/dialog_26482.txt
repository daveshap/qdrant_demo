LEX: Guess who? It's your old friend, Lex.
SUPERMAN: Luthor, I suspect if you had actually planted a bomb you'd be far away from here by now.
LEX: Silly me. How do I ever think I can fool the super guy. You're right, no bomb. I just knew you were too busy with the world peace bit to make a social call. I confess . . . I tricked you. Hey, you look great!
SUPERMAN: If you have any social skills, you've learned them from a rattlesnake. Just what are you up to?
LEX: Know something? You're a workaholic. A good guy 24 hours a day. Stop and smell the roses sometime. Take up a hobby. Get a pet . . . a kitten or a puppy. . .
SUPERMAN: It's common knowledge you hate children and animals. Why are you back in Metropolis?
LEX: Why? Because I want to be the first one to introduce you to a new kid on the block.
LEX: Look closely at his cell structure. See anything familiar?
SUPERMAN: You've broken all the laws of man, Luthor. And now you've broken the laws of nature! . . . I assume you must have hidden a device in one of the missiles I hurled into the sun!
