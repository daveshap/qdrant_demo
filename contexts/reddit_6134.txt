Starting Monday in the midst of COVID-19 outbreak
I'm starting a new job on Monday.  The offer is signed, background check cleared, etc etc.  My state just called for all non-essential employees to work from home for the foreseeable future.  The college I adjunct at is closed, effective immediately.   My husband is working from home right now due to a medical condition that makes him super vulnerable to COVID-19.

How do I broach working from home with my new employer before I even start? Should I even say anything? I thought about sending an e-mail asking about their contingency plan and explaining my husband's condition, but I don't want to be "that person" and send up red flags.

My new job could be done remotely once the setup is in place, but I expected to ask for that in the summer once they were confident in my work.  HELP!

EDIT: I sent an e-mail asking about their plans and got a response back almost immediately.  (It's a healthcare company, I would have no patient interactions).  They sent me all their COVID-19 details and were VERY understanding of the situation.  At this point I will be going in on Monday, but they are preparing to have me (and everyone who can) WFH immediately if the situation changes.
