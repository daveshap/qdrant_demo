CARTER: Look, I need some info and I don't have time to play around.
KENNY: Is this about the funny money?
CARTER: How'd you know?
KENNY: You've been asking loud questions in all the wrong places all morning. How come you always save me for last, James? When are you gonna learn. Shit don't happen I don't know about.
CARTER: So tell me what you know.
KENNY: I know Teddy Wu is cranking out a pretty good double sawbuck -- but you knew that too, didn't you?
CARTER: Yeah. We already been there. This is big, Kenny. Benjamins. Secret Service calls 'em superbills. Banks can't even tell the difference.
CARTER: What?
KENNY: One of my regulars lost fifty thousand dollars at the table here last week. I was about to send my boys down to tune his ass up, when the guy comes in and pays off the whole thing. Including the vig -- brand new sequential hundred dollar bills. I knew something was wrong. Cause this guy's got a regular job, no way he comes up with fifty grand in cash. But I tested the bills, infrared. The whole thing. And they checked out. 100%.
LEE: Do you still have the bills?
KENNY: I still have my lunch money from third grade.
