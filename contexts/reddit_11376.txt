It goes up again, but I hate being alone.
This year was a total mess so far. Lost my job and my girlfriend both at the same time and my parents didn't have the best reactions to make me feel much better.

However things went better lately, got a new job and can probably work on this Friday, since the weather will be good again here.

Nevertheless I really miss the time I was in a relationship. It's not my ex, I am quite happy it's over, since she meant more harm than love, without me realising it until we broke up.
I miss hugs. I miss sex. I miss kisses.
I know, deep down in my heart that someday I will find the women of my dreams, and hopefully be happy with her. But I feel like the older I get (weird to say this at 20yo) the more I am missing out, when it comes to love.

I'm really not a guy that likes to go to parties and all that and I will definetly not change that. Still... I kind of want this loneliness to end somehow. Not be alone.
