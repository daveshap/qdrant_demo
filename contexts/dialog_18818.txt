SHELLY: You don't like it?
HARRY: This was the Reverend Porter's wife, you have her looking like a two dollar hooker.
SHELLY: I think she looks nice! Her lips are very thin so I used the gloss to give them a more sensual quality, and her eyes just needed a little definition, and her hair, I'm sorry, nobody wears this hairdo anymore in 1972.
HARRY: She did. This photo was taken a month ago at the church food drive.
SHELLY: I just wanted to get past this &quot;old school Marm&quot; image.
HARRY: That wasn't an image. She WAS an old school Marm. Fix it.
SHELLY: Harry? I was just wondering, if there is anything wrong with Vada.
HARRY: What do you mean??
SHELLY: Well the other night at dinner...
HARRY: Oh that, she just likes to play.
SHELLY: I don't think so, I think she's confused about death.
HARRY: She was raised in a funeral home, she knows a thing or two about it.
SHELLY: Harry, I really think she.....
HARRY: She's a perfectly happy eleven year old girl, look, don't give me any advice about my daughter, okay?
