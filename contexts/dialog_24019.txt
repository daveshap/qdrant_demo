DETECTIVE: -- Forgive me, Mr. Taransky. I'm just trying to understand. All these films, TV appearances, magazine covers, internet interviews, publicity photos, snapshots from her childhood -- all fake. This is fake, this is fake -- fake, fake, fake, all fake.
VIKTOR: That's right. You understand perfectly. I will confess to fraud, not murder.
DETECTIVE: A fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions -- also bogus?
VIKTOR: Oh, no. The fan club is real. But they were worshipping computer code -- ones and zeros.
DETECTIVE: So, of course, you couldn't kill Simone because there never was a Simone.
VIKTOR: Of course.
DETECTIVE: And this Mr. Hank Aleno who you talk so much about, a renowned failure, who also happens to be so conveniently dead -- perhaps the man" you claim helped invent Simone is an invention himself?"
DETECTIVE: But not everyone's imaginary, are they, Mr. Taransky? I refer, of course, to Edith.
VIKTOR: Who?
