How do I break into top management?
Hi all. I have been unemployed for about 8 months now. It’s clear to me that I could get an entry level job but it won’t pay my mortgage. I have been passed over for at least 3 dozen mid-level roles, even with interviews going really well. The only two possibilities that remain appear to be either 1) I need new skills to be employable because I’m not skilled enough to be employed at the moment, or 2) I need to break into a director, VP, or even C-level job. 
I have 10 years tech marketing experience, MBA in Marketing with a minor in MIS and an Ivy undergrad. My last two employers were both generous with pay and extremely stingy with titles. 
Any suggestions for action I can take, books or articles to read, or other reality check to make?
