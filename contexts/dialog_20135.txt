BIG NURSE: Mister McMurphy. Patients aren't allowed in here.
MCMURPHY: Sorry, ma'am.
MCMURPHY: Pardon me, ma'am, can I ask you somethin'?
BIG NURSE: Yes, Mister McMurphy?
MCMURPHY: How 'bout turning off that music for a while so a man can hear himself think?
BIG NURSE: That music is for everyone, Mister McMurphy.
MCMURPHY: Well, say, how 'bout easin' it down a bit so a man don't have to shout!
BIG NURSE: Mister McMurphy, there are old men here who couldn't hear the music at all if it were lower. That music is all they have, and I wish you wouldn't lean against the glass there, your hands are staining the window.
