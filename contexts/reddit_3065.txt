How should I handle "why do you want to move" question when just 4 months in a new job?
I've almost 2 years of work experience as a Business Analyst. I left a very comfortable job in a reputed MNC to work for a "fast growth" start-up. The major attraction for this was that it came with a fancy international relocation. I figured it'd be an interesting challenge to work in a start up and in an international office, something radical that I can only do in the early stages of my career.
However, just two days before I was supposed to join, they told me that my relocation is on hold temporarily and I should start working remotely from my home with frequent travel to the actual office. This was supposed to be temporary for a maximum of two-three months. However, it's close to four months now and no updates on the relocation. I'm getting very frustrated with remote working because it's not at all what I signed up. The HR and my manager (who's otherwise a pretty decent fellow) are beating around the bush without giving me clear answers. And there's rumors that there's no relocation budget left.
I very strongly want to start looking for other jobs. But I find myself looking at ads with almost the same job description as my current job and I feel like I wouldn't be able to justify why I want to move without ratting out my employer. 
Should I stick around for longer? Or should I start looking and be honest during interviews?

TLDR- Is remote to non-remote movement an acceptable reason to look for a job change when you've just started a new remote job (which wasn't disclosed to be remote at the time of hiring) ?
