1 hour to go
I've already made up my mind, nobody can talk me out of it so don't even bother with 'dont do it', please
I always wanted to feed ducks, never did. I'm partially housebound thanks to agoraphobia and if the ducks touch me I'd have a panic attacks thanks to OCD, so I have never fed ducks.

This is just one of the things I never did with my life, I've wasted it and spent the first 6 years being happy then the rest feeling unhappy wishing I relived those years. 

I don't have a gun so my death will be painful as hell but its my only method

EDIT: I did it, but my instincts are running wild telling me to tell my parents, what do I say to them

EDIT 2: It failed, I'm in the hospital but I won't be admitted to the ward because of my agoraphobia, I wouldn't be able to handle it.

UPDATE
I tried to reply to you all while in the emergency room but I had no service, here's a bit of information on what happened.
I had a champagne flute full of disinfectant, however I fucked up. Turns out I was too confident that cleaning chemicals are always toxic, turns out the disinfectant was citric acid based.
I tried to kill myself with citric acid.
I didn't even read the back, I'm so fucking stupid. Ny organs aren't even partially affected.
I was not admitted to the psych ward, but I nearly was. My psychiatrist understood that due to my agoraphobia it would not help to admit me, so he vouched for my discharge, which I was discharged 12 hours after I went to the hospital

I had an ECG to check my heart, where I had to take off my shirt, my dad saw my self harm scars. (My mum already knew about it but my dad didn't, he has not mentioned it yet.)
