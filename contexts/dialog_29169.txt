GOOSE: Keller, Black Lion Squadron. I knew him at Pensacola. He's damn good.
MAVERICK: Is there anybody in the Navy you don't know?
GOOSE: Gotta keep track of the competition.
GOOSE: Slider -- they let you into Top Gun? If you're among the best in the Navy, I tremble for the security of this country.
SLIDER: Why Goose, whose butt did you kiss to get here?
GOOSE: The list is long, but distinguished.
SLIDER: So's my Johnson.
GOOSE: This is Maverick.
SLIDER: So I've heard.
GOOSE: Who's your pilot?
SLIDER: Tom Kazansky.
GOOSE: No shit. The Iceman....
SLIDER: Mister to you.
GOOSE: You think you can stay up with us.
SLIDER: I think, yeah, we'll show you a thing or two.
GOOSE: This is Evan Mitchell, he steers the thing.
SLIDER: So I heard. Steers it pretty close. Sorry to hear about Cougar. He was a good man.
