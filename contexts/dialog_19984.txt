GEORGE: Oh, you mean Fred.
BETTY: No, Del.
GEORGE: Right, Del. Del was one hot salesman. Of cars. He could talk anyone into anything.
BETTY: You knew Del?!
GEORGE: Honey, I didn't want to tell you at the time, but Del and I go way back. We went to school together. In fact, he saved my life. Two more minutes in that icy water and I would have drowned. But Del jumped in and grabbed me. We fell out of touch eventually, but I still owe him one.
BETTY: He never told me anything about... that's unbelievable!
LYLA: Funny, that's just what I was thinking...
GEORGE: I can't tell you how much it hurts me to hear that you married him.
