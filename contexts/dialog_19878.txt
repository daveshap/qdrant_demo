WILLIAM: Hello. Hi. Hi.
ANNA: Hi.
WILLIAM: Oh hi. It's William Thacker. We, ahm I work in a bookshop.
ANNA: You played it pretty cool here, waiting for three days to call.
WILLIAM: No, I've never played anything cool in my entire life. Spike, who I'll stab to death later, never gave me the message.
ANNA: Oh -- Okay.
WILLIAM: Perhaps I could drop round for tea or something?
ANNA: Yeh -- unfortunately, things are going to be pretty busy, but... okay, let's give it a try. Four o'clock could be good.
WILLIAM: Right. Great. Classic. Classic.
WILLIAM: Which floor?
TARQUIN: Three.
WILLIAM: Are you sure you...?
TARQUIN: Yes.
WILLIAM: Oh. Right.
