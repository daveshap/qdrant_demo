GWEN: Get back here, junior bean counter. This is your supervisor speaking.
TREVOR: Please, Gwen. You're- you're all over me.
GWEN: How do you think you got this job, cock? Mmm. I'm still tingling all over from our little midnight swim.
GWEN: What's wrong, Trev?
TREVOR: Nothing, look. Gwen I really like you-
GWEN: And it shows. Least it did last night at the quarry. In a big way.
GWEN: YOU'RE giving ME a speeding ticket? Mr. Mario Andretti himself?
TREVOR: Gwen, my wife's dead.
GWEN: Oh I see. That again. Trevor? I realize it must be hard. But Christ how long does it take someone to move on?
TREVOR: That was cold...
GWEN: No, making another woman compete with someone who's been dead eight months. That's cold.
