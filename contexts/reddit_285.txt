Hijab: what should I do
Hello I am I hijabs(10 years) the reason for why I started to wear it was because I just liked it I thought it was pretty. A lot of people think I am religious but I am not I don’t pray and I don’t really follow most of the rules. I am not one of the hijab is that takes it off and on I just keep it on all of the time. And my problem is that the hijab for me was something that I was proud of that I loved and I used to feel like it didn’t restrict me, but know I still love wearing it. I am just sick of having to restrict my self from dressing the way I wanna dress, cause I have a berry curvy body so when i just wanna wear a top and jeans it looks to provocative. Another thing is that I would like to go to clubs and party(not drink) just party without people judging me. I used to feel free in my hijab but now I just feel like I am suffocating. And my parents don’t care if I take it off or not it just that I have been wearing it for so long that it’s so hard to stop and I am so scared that some people will look at me and see a failure. And a part of me wanna keep it on but another part of me don’t want to. I don’t really feel like I can’t be myself, I have felt like this in 4 years just hoping it will go away. I just don’t know what i should do please don’t judge me.
