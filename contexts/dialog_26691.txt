STEVE: I don't take kindly to you and Falco selling me ethics. Who's the injured party here, you?
HUNSECKER: Right now you're in no position to ask questions! And your snide remarks---
STEVE: Wait a minute, I haven't handed over punishing privileges to you YET! Put the whip down and I might respect what you're saying...
HUNSECKER: Susie, did you know about this accusation...?
SUSAN: No...
HUNSECKER: Before you leave, son, I'll answer your question---Susan Hunsecker is the injured party here! Or will I be hearing next that I don't even have my sister's welfare at heart...
STEVE: Mr. Hunsecker, you've got more twists than a barrel of pretzels.
HUNSECKER: You hear that, Susie... Continue please...
STEVE: I'm afraid I can't cope with them.
