KAMEN: Hey, boss. Wondered where you'd gotten to.
HIROKO: I just... wanted to be put on my own for a while. Clear my head.
KAMEN: Didn't feel like whoopin' it up with the rest of us blue collars, huh?
HIROKO: I've got a lot of thinking to do. 'Sides, the room was getting too crowded for me.
KAMEN: Not too much of the socializing type, then?
HIROKO: No, not really. More sort of the 'claustrophobic' type.
HIROKO: I'm serious. That's why I switched from orbiting to planetary installations.
KAMEN: Is that a fact.
HIROKO: Uh-huh. Used to get it pretty bad. I'd wake up in a cold sweat and want to claw open a vacuum hatch.
KAMEN: How long you been out here for now, anyway? Three months?
HIROKO: Four.
KAMEN: And before that?
HIROKO: Six month stint on Datus.
KAMEN: Only six?
HIROKO: What is this? 'Twenty Questions'?
KAMEN: Just curious. There's a lot of talk goes around.
