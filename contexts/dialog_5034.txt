NICOLE: What are you talking about?
KIMBERLY: Weird? You mean like you hanging out with that homeless, Poke? I saw you last night after the game.
BUFFY: Pike.
NICOLE: You're having a fling with him?
JENNIFER: He doesn't look fifty.
BUFFY: Guys. Guys! Reality pulled out of her five minutes ago.
KIMBERLY: Oh, thank you very much.
NICOLE: Like you've got a grip.
KIMBERLY: You're so out of it. You've blown off cheerleading, you've blown off dance committee --
BUFFY: Excuse me for having something important to do.
KIMBERLY: This isn't important? The earth is our home.
BUFFY: Kimberly, it's a dance. It's a stupid dance with a bunch of stupid kids that I see every stupid day.
NICOLE: So, we're stupid now?
KIMBERLY: You know, just because you're having full-on wiggans doesn't mean you have to drag us into it. This isn't just any dance. It happens ot be the last dance of our last year.
NICOLE: Except for Prom.
KIMBERLY: Right.
JENNIFER: And Spring Fling.
KIMBERLY: Okay.
NICOLE: And the January Semi-formal --
KIMBERLY: Okay! Look, Buffy. You want to play house with the unwashed masses, that's fine. But personally, I think you ought to spend a little time prioritizing. I really do.
BUFFY: Listen to you. What language are you speaking?
KIMBERLY: Get out of my facial.
NICOLE: Well, I guess you got what you came for.
BUFFY: Nicole...
NICOLE: Later for it.
