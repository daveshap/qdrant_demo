The best description word for 'something you can sense' In a context, you are blindfolded, and you are trying to pick up on any of your surroundings (sound, smells, etc). In other words, you are trying to pick up on any information that you can sense.The best word I could think of was like 'sensable' information (such word does not exist) or 'tangible' (but it is only limited to touching sense). What would be the best description word alternative for it?<blockquote>  I was killing time by picking up on any bit of >insert word description there&lt; information regarding my \u201cblindfolded\u201d surroundings. </blockquote>
