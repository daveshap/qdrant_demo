Unpopular Opinion: You aren't perfect just the way you are, and we gotta stop these mass-posts about how everyone is beautiful and crap
The best in life comes when you learn how to improve yourself and when you actually have goals to be smarter or have a better personality and obtain them. Who cares if you are smart, or beautiful, or funny or whatever attribute you want to obtain? It shouldn't matter, everyone can improve and that's all we can do. Normalizing compliments just makes people more depressed when they aren't receiving any, and we should be teaching people to just do whatever the Hell they like to do, regardless of whether they're complimented or whether that thing makes them feel beautiful or whatever. The best in life comes when you aren't trying to impress anyone. That is all.

Edit: Holy jeez guys, what the hell.
