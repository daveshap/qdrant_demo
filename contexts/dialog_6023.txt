SALVATORE: You're still beautiful...
ELENA: Don't be silly...I'm old. Don't look at me like that, please. Why'd you come back?
SALVATORE: Alfredo died. Do you remember him?
ELENA: Of course I remember him. I'm sorry. You were terribly fond of him.
SALVATORE: I saw your daughter. She's beautiful! Who knows how many Salvatores must be running after her...
ELENA: One or two. Bur there're not all that many Salvatores. I've got a son, too...he's older. And you, do you have children?
SALVATORE: No. And I'm not married. Are you happy?
ELENA: All things considered, yes. Even if it wasn't what I dreamt of then...
ELENA: My husband...you know him.
SALVATORE: Sure, sure! Boccia... What's he do?
ELENA: Politics. He's the district representative. We met at the University in Pisa.
