Don't geographically limit yourself! It's a big world.
I just checked out 27 years of earnings on the social security website. It's almost like a career diary. As I reviewed it I realized that as tough as relocating can be, it was a very necessary part of my career. I moved to five cities in 3 states in 27 years but I'm convinced that my income (and my job satisfaction) would probably be two thirds what it is now without having moved around the country for the right opportunities.  You may have to live where you don't want to as you are building your resume' but when you've proven yourself you can start choosing where YOU want to live. Here's my income path:

1987 $3,870 Graduated with a business degree

1988 $11,340 Unemployment, temp jobs, depression

1989 $23,308 Moved to city I didn't want to live in, but grateful for the opportunity.

1990 $24,670 Promotion and relocation to another city.

1991 $26,454 New city, new company.

1997 $50,603 New city, new company. 1st job as "the boss".

2003 $79,164 New city, new company.
 
2005 $90,000 Promotion within same company. No relocation.

2013 $111,295 I have a lot of autonomy. I like the people I work with and I live on a gorgeous part of the planet.

Just load up the Uhaul and GO!
