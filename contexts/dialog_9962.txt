BLACK PUSHER: I don't...
DOYLE: Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
BLACK PUSHER: What?
DOYLE: Did you ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
BLACK PUSHER: I don't know what you're talkin' about.
DOYLE: Were you ever in Poughkeepsie?
BLACK PUSHER: No... yeah...
DOYLE: Did you ever sit on the edge of the bed, take off your socks and stick your fingers between your toes?
BLACK PUSHER: Man, I'm clean.
DOYLE: You made three sales to your roaches back there. We had to chase you through all this shit and you tell me you're clean?
RUSSO: Who stuck up the laundromat?
DOYLE: How about that time you were picking your feet in Poughkeepsie?
