This is Rick Hasen, ready for my first AMA!

I've got a new book coming out in March called, The Justice of Contradictions: Antonin Scalia and the Politics of Disruption. You can see more about that book here:

I'm happy to field questions on issues such as campaign finance, voter id, voter fraud, redistricting, the Supreme Court nomination process, and more.  I can't promise I have answers but I will try.
