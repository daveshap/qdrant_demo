GRACE: ...Oh, come on! You think the same thing!
JUDITH: I just could never say it!
GRACE: Do you want to go around by the old road?
JUDITH: Why don't we just cut through the woods?
GRACE: You want to go down or stay along the river?
JUDITH: We already did the river. Let's go down and across the old bridge. We can circle back.
