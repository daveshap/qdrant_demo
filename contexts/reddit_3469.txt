Is it just me or are 80% of dating profiles these days some variation of "love food, traveling and netflix"?
Since when are things like eating food hobbies? 

Why do people think this somehow makes them appear interesting? Or do they want to appear interesting at all?

I get the feeling dating apps these days are no longer about dating and more about collecting people as an ego boost as well as a time waster when you are bored.
