Why updating from behind a proxy results in hash sum mismatch error while direct WiFi has no issues? This has started from Ubuntu's 14.04 LTS version.I work on Ubuntu at my office where internet works from behind a proxy server.Earlier, I could just give the usual update commands from the terminal and they just worked.But 14.04 LTS onwards, it has become exceedingly difficult to carry out even such a mundane task as updating my system.Every time I try to update the system from behind the proxy, I get errors of 'Hash sum Mismatch'.But interestingly (and to my utter dismay) when I connect to internet directly using my mobile phone's wifi, the update works absolutely normally.I have tried all the workarounds suggested to alleviate the Hash Sum Mismatch errors. None has worked.I suspect something is wrong with the way our proxy is configured. If not, I would really appreciate a good hand here.Thanks.
