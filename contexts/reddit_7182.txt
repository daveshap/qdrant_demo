Job training was delayed due to COVID-19 about a month ago - is it time to give up?
Hello,

Long story short - I got hired right before everything got out of control. I was scheduled to start training the end of March, but I still haven't received word from anyone. I emailed/called to check in and keep myself in the loop, but the manager not once replied to my emails or calls. I'd just like to know if I still have this job or not, because if not then I'll have to start yet another gloriously terrible job search...again. The last form of communication I received from the director was the weekend before the training - the voicemail seemed very sincere and reassuring, but I'm still unsure.

But of course, even if they were to email/call me, not quite sure what they would tell me. Our state is scheduled to "reopen" around June - is it likely my employer will me around then? My parents are gung-ho about this job and believe my employer *will* call me no matter what, but knowing that ghosting is such a terrible, common practice nowadays I'm starting to get really nervous.

Also, I guess knowing that it has taken me nearly 8 months to land a job after college (this job) has made me cynical and bitter towards all of this. If this job doesn't work out then I seriously don't know what I'm going to do. The thought of sending out more resumes is extremely depressing, to be honest.

What should I do, in your opinion? Wait this out until the end of the month, or start applying for other jobs?
