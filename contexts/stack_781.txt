Very high fan speed on Ubuntu 18.04 I did a fresh install of Ubuntu 18.04, alongside Windows 10. On Ubuntu, one of my fans is extremely high, although the temperature is fine, and this is not happening on Windows. I've tried some of the solutions suggested in this forum, without success.The one with the problem seems to be nct6775/fan2, at least it is the only one working at +1155 rpm, according to program HardInfo. My motherboard is an ASUS H81M-A.
