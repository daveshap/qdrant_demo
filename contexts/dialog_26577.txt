MACKELWAY: Let's talk about Zero.
MURMAN: [Hello, Agent Mackelway. How's the watch? Maybe you can do one of those TV commercials, I found my watch under a serial killer's heart and it was still ticking.]
MACKELWAY: I want to help you.
MURMAN: [Not the heart, the watch.]
MACKELWAY: I've located the Suspect Zero file. Did you know there was one? Koessler ordered it as part of your evaluation.
MURMAN: [Don't jerk a jerk-off. There's nothing in the Bureau mainframe.]
MACKELWAY: Not everything is imputed to memory. The most confidential stuff is kept top secret hard copy. Why would the Zero file be kept secret?
MURMAN: [You tell me.]
MACKELWAY: George Sheldon? The second serial killer killed in the manner of his killings. The crime scene profile was never entered into VICAP. At whose request? David Koessler.
MURMAN: [What does the file say?]
MACKELWAY: I want to go live with you.
MURMAN: [And I want to go back to Needlepoint.]
MACKELWAY: Leave this room, I'll go back with you, blow your cover.
MURMAN: [I don't think so. We want the same thing. See ya.]
KOESSLER: Why did you go to Chicago?
MACKELWAY: I was visiting an old college friend.
KOESSLER: You didn't tell anyone where you were?
MACKELWAY: An oversight, sir, I apologize. I felt I needed to get away for a day. The pressure. Paid for my own ticket.
KOESSLER: I'm told you've asked for a Bureau cross-check of flight records to and from El Paso, Ft. Myers, Omaha, the Murman murder time frames.
MACKELWAY: I was looking for a pattern.
KOESSLER: That breaks my confidentiality stipulation.
MACKELWAY: I didn't use Low's name.
KOESSLER: There was talk of a file photo.
MACKELWAY: In Ft. Myers before your instruction. Nowhere else, sir.
KOESSLER: Watch out for Dick Low, he's a liar; he has his own world. There was a Junior Agent in Seattle, not unlike you, an Agent who fell under Dick's spell. He'd have done anything for Agent Low. Richard got this Agent to take a suspect to the crime scene, beat him up, force a confession -- all unauthorized, all illegal. The Agent died that night, killed by the suspect. Richard Low got him killed. Worst of all, we had to hush it up, let the suspect go. The suspect was George Sheldon, the second man Richard killed.
MACKELWAY: I understand.
KOESSLER: As far as the public knows, Richard Low is dead. And he will stay dead until we kill him.
LOW: Agent Mackelway?
MACKELWAY: Yes.
LOW: This is Richard Low. Stay on the phone. Do not disconnect. I'm watching you. I will instruct you where to drive.
MACKELWAY: Yes, sir.
LOW: When you exit, head east on 10th.
