How can I mount a one gang box to a pipe? I would like to mount a single gang box to a pipe and stay code compliant. I have a 1-1/2\" pipe (but that can be changed), and I would like to have an outlet on the side of the pipe for mounting a projector on the pipe and plugging it in right at the pipe instead of at the wall.Or, even better, is there a product that I can mount to a pipe that has a box integrated into it?
