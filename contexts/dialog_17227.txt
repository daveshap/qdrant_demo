HAWKEYE: We've stuck it out for a whole week now... Pretty girl.
DUKE: We sure don't aim to cause any trouble... Yeah, she seems to grow on you.
HENRY: You don't aim to cause any trouble â€“ But?
HAWKEYE: But we strongly suspect something will happen to screw up this splendid organization of yours if you don't get that sky pilot out of our tent.
HENRY: Your tent?
DUKE: Yeah, maybe move that nurse in. She don't seem the type to keep you awake praying.
HENRY: I have been in this Army a long time. I know just what you guys are up to. But there are limits...
HAWKEYE: We'll find out what they are when you throw us out.
HENRY: That's all the commitment you're offering me? Or do you have some more extravagant gesture of cooperation?
DUKE: No, Hawkeye just said it all.
HAWKEYE: Except we forgot one other small thing.
DUKE: What's that?
HAWKEYE: The chest-cutter.
DUKE: Yeah, that's right. You better get us a chest-cutter before there's trouble.
HAWKEYE: This outfit needs somebody who can find his way around the pulmonary anatomy when the bases are loaded.
DUKE: And it's the ninth inning.
