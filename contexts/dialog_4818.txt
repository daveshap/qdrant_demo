FRANK: He wants to pull that tube out. It's pretty painful--that's why they keep him sedated--but it's a good sign.
MARY: You sure? I know my father would hate to be tied down. He wouldn't even go to the dentist.
FRANK: That's how it's done. You have to keep the body going until the brain and heart recover enough to go on their own.
MARY: He's better, though, right?
FRANK: He's better.
MARY: Look, I'm sorry, but it's important to me. I mean, a week ago I was wishing he was dead. And now I want hear his voice again, just once more-- you know what I mean?
MARCUS: Went over to Sal's got this. There must be some place in Hell for a guy who sells a dollar-fifty a slice. I call you if anything comes up.
FRANK: Thanks.
