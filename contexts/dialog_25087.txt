VON SCHERBACH: You have no idea how boring my life here is. If it weren't for an occasional air raid or some foolish prisoners trying to escape, I wouldn't know what to do. I want to thank you for keeping me company. I don't drink, I don't smoke, I don't read. I hate music. That only leaves good conversation. It will be a shame to lose you.
DUNBAR: I didn't do it -- I didn't do it.
VON SCHERBACH: Of course you did! Twenty-six carloads of munitions gone off like a trick cigar! The S.S. is running around in circles. The Gestapo is arresting the wrong people. And von Scherbach has caught the fish. Most amusing, isn't it?
VON SCHERBACH: You are being rude again.
DUNBAR: I want to sleep. Give me five minutes on that couch.
VON SCHERBACH: Nine-thirty. General von Pfeffinger should be at his desk by now. Shall we call Berlin and tell him the good news?
DUNBAR: I didn't do it. I didn't do it.
