FRIDA: Hello?
JENNIFER: Frida? You okay?
FRIDA: Never been better. Peter spent the night. I must really love him. He's still alive.
JENNIFER: Oh thank god. Maybe this whole thing is really over.
FRIDA: God I hope so. Hey can I call you later? Peter's still here. He's in the shower.
JENNIFER: Sure. See ya.
