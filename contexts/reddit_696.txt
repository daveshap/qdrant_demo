I'm having trouble supporting my friends
A lot of my friends have recently been going to me for emotional help and such. Even if we aren't that close. I'm having trouble supporting them all and it's been making me feel worse and worse. I can't seem to help them all and it makes me feel awful. It's been getting to be very draining and stressful and I don't know what to do. One of my friends recently tried to commit suicide and I don't want to lose any of my friends. How can I comfort them? How can I make sure I have the energy to do so, and effectively?
