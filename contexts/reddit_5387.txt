Feeling Paranoid About Losing New Job
So I got hired at my new job as a marketer and I have been here for a month. I do my work to the best of my ability, the coworkers are nice, the boss took me and a few coworkers out to a few lunches and a dinner. The boss thanked me for joining their team and appreciated the work that I put in. But sometimes I feel like I'm not putting in a lot of work, I ask a lot of questions sometimes when I'm stuck ( For some I realized the answer was right in front of me but it was too late), and I feel like I don't know much but my coworkers are patient. This is the first good job that I received out of college and I am really fearful of losing it.
