I have been struggling the past three months. My mom died and my boyfriend of 7 years left. Nobody understands the pain, and nobody understands the situation. My mom wouldve. My mom wouldve told me all the right things instead of all the shit im hearing right now. I want to go to my mom.
So i have a bottle of pills in my hand, and im waiting for my dad and my brother to fall asleep. So i can sleep. So i can see her again.
