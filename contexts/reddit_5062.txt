Mental health and the job search
I graduated from an Ivy back in June 2019. Since then, I've had a couple internships (paid, thankfully) but no real job yet. Honestly, the pressure and shame of being an intern who's still looking for a job is getting to me and I'm finding it hard to get out of bed in the morning. Do any of you have any tips for keeping up with your mental health while hunting for a job? Thanks.
