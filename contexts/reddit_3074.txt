Have anyone given up the idea of 'career' and just hop jobs to jobs as long as it pays bills?
It seems nowadays, there is no jobs or career ladder that would last forever. So somewhere in the mid 40s we still have to face mid-life crisis. It looks like hoping from job to job, industry to industry to pay bills in the way to go.
