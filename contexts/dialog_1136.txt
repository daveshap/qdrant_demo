JOSEPH: Really? How delightful. May I ask when you marry?
MOZART: Well - Well we haven't quite received my father's consent, Your Majesty. Not entirely. Not altogether.
JOSEPH: Excuse me, but how old are you?
MOZART: Twenty-six.
JOSEPH: Well, my advice is to marry this charming young lady and stay with us in Vienna.
