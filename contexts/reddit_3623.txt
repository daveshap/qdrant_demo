If you're not into someone just tell them!
So one thing I've been dealing with while dating is when someone realises you're not the person for them but then string you along for ages and ages.

It's much less hurtful to be told "I'm just not that into you" than feel like you're fighting a losing battle trying to keep someone you never had. Leaving morsels of "maybe in a few months", "I'm not ready yet", and getting drunk and sending messages about how much you like us is confusing and hurts more in the long run. 

This isn't only for men or women... everyone should take this advice. In trying not to hurt someones feelings, instead you're giving them hope where there is none. You're letting someone hang on to you knowing you won't take it further. 

Sure, in that moment, the rejection sucks. But a definitive answer means I can start moving on. Telling me "if we met at a different time, things would be different" just makes me want to wait a few months and try again and that's totally not fair if you're just not interested.

I know some people will say, well if you know they're stringing you along then why put up with it? And the reason is because all logic and sanity seems to go out of the window when you genuinely like someone. You want it to work so you make excuses and even if you tell yourself that theres always a part of you that wonders what could have been. Was the person being genuine? Could it have worked out if you were just a bit more patient?

It's so unnecessary to keep hurting someone because you don't  wanna deal with upsetting someone.
