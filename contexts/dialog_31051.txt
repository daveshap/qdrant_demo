SAILOR: Let's go dancin', peanut. I'm ready.
LULA: We gotta be careful, honey, my mama's gonna have Johnnie Farragut on us like a duck on a june bug, and he's one clever detective? You know how clever? He once told me that he could find an honest man in Washington. My toenails gotta dry first anyways, Sailor.
SAILOR: One thing puzzles my mind, sugar... You're twenty years old - aren't you ever curious why your mama has this fixation on keepin' us apart? Puttin' a detective on us. I'll tell ya Lula... Well... It's more'n me killin' Bob Ray Lemon...
LULA: Maybe my mama cares for me just a little too much...
SAILOR: Yeah, maybe...
MARIETTA: Hey, Sailor boy, you wanna fuck Lula's mama?...
SAILOR: No.
MARIETTA: Well, she wants to fuck you.
