Is it bad that I want to be laid off now that my job security is up in the air?
I was told yesterday that my job is on thin ice. Up until then, I had motivation to work my hardest for the company. Now I just feel let down. 

I’m in my early twenties, live with my parents, and I am honestly content with collecting unemployment. The “will they/won’t they lay me off” thing is simply too much added stress for me. Am I right to WANT to be laid off, so I can collect unemployment in the short term?

This may seem like an insane question...
