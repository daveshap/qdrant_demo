Opening in my program, a way to get your foot the door with federal employment. (San Diego)
I know many people get discouraged applying to federal employment. This is a good way to get into it if you want it, I didn't train for trade but it pays well and has good benefits. 


The announcement for this year's hire IS NOW OPEN and will close at 9:00 PM Pacific Time on Sunday, September 29th.
 
The Announcement can be found at this URL:
 
https://www.usajobs.gov/GetJob/ViewDetails/352549100
 
 
 
 
To apply you need to:
 
1.   Create an account at usajobs.gov
 
2.   Create a resume on usajobs.gov using resume builder. (You can also upload a resume but building it on the site will make your resume more useful to the hiring managers)
 
3.   When the announcement opens, it will have a button labeled "APPLY NOW" - click on the button to begin the application process. You cannot apply after the close date/time.
 
4.   Submit your resume for the program via usajobs (Clicking the "apply now" button will lead you through all of the steps.)
 
5.   Answer and submit all supplemental questions (starts off asking you to confirm if you are 18 or older and a US citizen).  Be sure to answer all questions accurately - your answers will be verified before you are offered    employment.
 
6.   Upload and send any requested supporting documentation.
 
7.  The system will tell you when your application is complete, and you will get an automated confirmation email indicating that your information has been received.
 
Once the announcement closes, the resumes will be reviewed by the hiring managers and selections will be made for interviews, which will be held around the first week of November.
 
Those that are selected will start working on Monday, January 13th, 2014.
 
Best of luck!
