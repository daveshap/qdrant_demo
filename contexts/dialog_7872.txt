DOLORES: How long have you been doing this?
ED: Since I was a kid. My mom wanted a girl, so she used to dress me in girlie clothing. It just kinda became a habit.
DOLORES: Jesus Christ! And you never told me?
ED: This is my way of telling you --
DOLORES: What, by putting it in a fuckin' script, for everyone to see?! What kind of sick mind would operate like that?
DOLORES: And what about this so-called Barbara" character? It's obviously ME! I'm so embarrassed! This is <u>our</u> <u>life</u>!"
ED: Of course it is. And that's why you should play the part.
DOLORES: Oh! You got nerve, buddy.
ED: It's a damn good role.
DOLORES: <u>That's not the issue</u>!! Ugh! How can you act so casual, when you're dressed like that?!
ED: It takes me comfortable.
DOLORES: Oh, just like in the script!
