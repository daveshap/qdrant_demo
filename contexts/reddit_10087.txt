Hostile work environment
I'm in student affairs and I work in an extremely hostile work environment. I believe I'm being discriminated against on the basis of my gender. I feel that the discrimination is coming from the top down (meaning, from supervisors or above straight down to me). What do I do?  I need this job but am feeling stuck. It has negatively impacted many areas of my life and I feel like I can't be myself for fear of losing my position. 

Thanks for reading this and responding to it.
