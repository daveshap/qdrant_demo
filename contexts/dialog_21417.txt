VIVIAN: I thought maybe you'd like dinner.
EDWARD: Thank you. I would. Nice.
VIVIAN: Wait till you see what I have on underneath.
EDWARD: Please.
VIVIAN: What about dinner?
EDWARD: Dinner can wait.
VIVIAN: You always been rich?
EDWARD: No.
VIVIAN: Seems like it. I guess it's easy to get used to, huh?
EDWARD: Easier than learning how to be poor. My father's family was wealthy. When I was young there were cars and houses, private schools, nannies. But then my father divorced my mother to marry another woman. And he took his money with him.
VIVIAN: Keep talkin'. I like hearin'.
EDWARD: Not much to tell. I went to public school. Went to university on scholarship. Went to work for an investment firm. In eight years I owned it. My father was chairman of the board of the third company I ever went after. I swallowed that company and shit out the pieces. One of the pieces was him.
VIVIAN: You still mad at'm?
EDWARD: He died a long time ago.
