constantly flooded with memories and thoughts of every mistake in my life.
i just want to sleep but i can’t. every time i close my eyes it’s something shitty that’s happened to me or something shitty or stupid that i’ve done / said.

so i sit awake and cry and panic and i can’t function.

my mental health has always been a disaster but it really feels like non-stop deterioration at this point.

i hate that i never have anything new to say. i can’t articulate anything so it’s just the same old “i don’t want to be here anymore why can’t i get the guts to end it already” over and over.

i’m so miserable and so tired of being ALONE.

i know that i have love and good in my heart to give to people but i’m so fucking stupid i just can’t talk to anyone.

i know it’s never going to end until i do it. i know i will never meet someone who will stay. i know there’s no point. i just want to die.
