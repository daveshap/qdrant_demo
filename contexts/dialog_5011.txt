BUFFY: That is so cool.
NICOLE: Thank you very much.
BUFFY: Nobody is even gonna look at the game.
JENNIFER: Hey, I was thinking, for the dance, what about a big sign that says 'Don't Tread On Me'. You know, and a picture of the earth.
BUFFY: Don't tread on the earth?
NICOLE: I don't get it.
BUFFY: How do you not tread on the earth? I mean, you kind of have to.
JENNIFER: I never thought of that.
NICOLE: I gotta bail. You coming?
BUFFY: You guys blow. I'm waiting on Cassandra. She's gonna help me with my history.
NICOLE: Cassandra's really smart.
BUFFY: Yeah... She's okay, though.
NICOLE: I guess.
JEFFREY: Are you going out with Jeffrey tonight?
BUFFY: Jealous?
BUFFY: Don't worry, Jennifer. Someday your prince will come.
NICOLE: Yeah, just make sure you do first. Let's go, guys.
BUFFY: B'bye.
BUFFY: God, where the hell did you come from? You scared me to death.
MERRICK: I'm sorry. That was impressive. The... tumbling.
BUFFY: What? Oh. I used to do gymnastics. Are you looking for someone?
MERRICK: I'm looking for you, actually.
BUFFY: Am I in trouble or something?
MERRICK: Not at all. My name is Merrick. I was sent to find you some time ago. I should have found you much sooner but there were... complications. You should have been taught, prepared.
BUFFY: What are you talking about?
MERRICK: I've searched the entire world for you, Buffy.
BUFFY: Why?
MERRICK: To bring you... your birthright.
BUFFY: My birthright? You mean, like a trust fund?
BUFFY: I had a trust fund my great- grandfather, or maybe it was an inheritance, 'cause he's dead, and I spent it on shoes.
MERRICK: You must come with me. It's much too late already. You must come with me to the graveyard.
BUFFY: Wait a minute. My birthright is in the graveyard? Later not.
MERRICK: Wait!
BUFFY: You're one of those skanky old men that, like, attack girls and stuff. Forget you. My, um, my boyfriend is gonna be here in about thirty seconds, and he's way testy.
MERRICK: You don't understand. You have been chosen.
BUFFY: Chosen to go to the graveyard? Why don't you just take the first runner up, okay?
MERRICK: You must believe me. You must come with me while there's still time.
BUFFY: Time to do what?
MERRICK: To stop the killing. To stop the vampires.
BUFFY: Let me get this straight. You're like, this greasy bum, and I have to go to the graveyard with you 'cause I'm chosen, and there's vampires.
MERRICK: Yes.
BUFFY: Does Elvis talk to you? Tell you to do things? Do you see spots?
MERRICK: I don't have time for your prattling. I have proof. You bear the mark.
