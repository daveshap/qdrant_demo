PETER: But the thumb always works. Different ways to do it, though. Depends on how you feel. For instance, number one is a short, jerky movement— That shows independence. You don't care if they stop or not. 'Cause you got some money in your pocket, see?
ELLIE: Clever.
PETER: Number two is a wider movement—a smile goes with that one—like this. That means you got a couple of brand new stories about the farmer's daughter.[12]
ELLIE: You figured that all out yourself, huh?
PETER: Oh, that's nothing. Now take number three, for instance. That's a pip. It's the pathetic one. When you're broke—and hungry—and everything looks black. It's a long movement like this— —with a follow through.
ELLIE: Amazing.
PETER: Hm? Yeah, but it's no good if you haven't got a long face with it.
ELLIE: Here comes a car!
PETER: Now watch me. I'm going to use Number One. Keep your eye on that thumb, baby, and see what happens.
