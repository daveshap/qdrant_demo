I no called no showed, 3 times.
So during the week, t-mobile got attacked with a DDOS, I had no means of being able to call in to work, while my mother was sick with what looked like COVID-19, but I guess it wasn't because she's magically recovered within 3 to 4 days. The no call no shows were not consecutive, and no one at work seemed to even bother to ask where I was or anything, so in my head, you know, no big deal I guess.
I ended up doing this once more, recently, because I am stupid and I overslept. My department manager said this wasn't good and he would have a meeting with me the next time I worked.

With situations like these, wouldn't you usually just be fired on the spot?

 Thoughts? I don't want to lose my job, and I know it was really dumb of me, but the job seemed to be so laid back, and I should have known better.
