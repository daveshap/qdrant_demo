D'ANGELO: Excuse me, Steve. I said namely you shouldn't go around wild, blaming people without justification.
STEVE: I thought you might have a faint idea of how this item originated.

SIDNEY: Dallas, ask your own manager - he's standing here like a pained wolfhound - Hunsecker and Elwell are enemies to the knife. So how do you get him doing J.J. a favor?
STEVE: It is a favor, isn't it?
SIDNEY: According to you, yeah. Dallas, your mouth is as big as a basket and twice as empty!

Don't give me that look, Dallas - J.J. believes in fair play. And secondly, this could splatter his sister with rotten egg by implication - your her boyfriend!
STEVE: You're talking very fast.
SIDNEY: Well, I'll tell you what - excuse me for breathing, will ya? How do you like it? He comes to my office and -

STEVE: Don't apologize for me, Frank!
D'ANGELO: ...excited with good reason, I wanted to say. Because this endangers the future of the whole quintet...
