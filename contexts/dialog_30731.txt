DR. HEFNER: No way he's going anywhere. He's been well sedated.
HEATHER: He doesn't have to be awake to be on his feet.
DR. HEFNER: What?
HEATHER: He sleepwalks, you idiot! He's fully capable of walking out of this hospital. Oh my God...He thinks I've gone home...
JOHN SAXON: John Saxon. Do you have any idea what time it is?
HEATHER: John. It's Heather. I need help!
JOHN SAXON: You got it. What's happening?
HEATHER: Dylan's run away from the hospital. I don't know whether he's wandering around or heading for the house. But I think Freddy's after him. I know it sounds crazy!
JOHN SAXON: You're right. That sounds crazy!
HEATHER: John. Will you please just look for him around the hospital? I'm gonna go right to the house. Will you help me, John? Please!
