PAUL: So what did he say when he called?
AUGGIE: Nothing much. He said his socks and underpants were dirty, and would we mind driving up with his things. Fucking kids, huh? They take you for granted every time.
PAUL: Nice machine, Auggie. Where'd you find it?
AUGGIE: It's Tommy's. The sucker owed me a favor.
PAUL: It's not a long drive. An hour, an hour and a half. We'll be back in time for dinner.
AUGGIE: We'd better be. I haven't spent a night out of Brooklyn in fourteen years, and I'm not about to break my record now. Besides, I've got to be on my corner at eight sharp tomorrow morning.
