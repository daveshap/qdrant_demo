Power strips show fault in some outlets but not others I'm not sure if this is on topic or not, but I thought I would ask.I have a few power strips (surge protectors) in my house that I use for computers, TV, etc.Some of these have a \"fault\" or \"surge\" light on them.  Some of them have \"protected\" light.These are three prong power strips.My question is, why do these show surge or fault on some outlets and on others, they do not.  I'm assuming it's some polarity issue with neutral and hot?  I know almost nothing about AC current.Also, should I be concerned about this or should I have an electrician inspect these outlets?Thanks.
