VINCENT: Are you breathing?
MAX: Yes.
VINCENT: What else calms you down? Candy? Cigarettes? Sex? Breathe.
MAX: Music.
VINCENT: Play music.
VINCENT: Chopin prelude. Stodgy, but nice. Here's the deal. I didn't want you involved in this. Still breathing? But now that you are, we have to make the best of it, Max. Improvise. Life is that way. Adapt to your environment. Survive. Darwin. Shit happens." The I Ching. Whatever. Roll with it."
MAX: I Ching? You threw a man out a window!
VINCENT: I didn't throw him, he fell.
MAX: What'd he do to you?
VINCENT: Nothing. I only met him the one time.
MAX: How can you kill him like that?
VINCENT: I should only kill people after I get to know 'em? Six billion people on the planet, you're getting bent out of shape 'cause of one fat guy?
MAX: Who was he?
VINCENT: What do you care? Ever hear of Rwanda?
MAX: Rwanda-Burundi. Central Africa.
VINCENT: Tens of thousands killed before sundown. Nobody's killed that fast since Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Did you bat an eye, Max? Join Amnesty International? No. I off one Angeleno, you throw a hissy fit...
MAX: I don't know any Rwandans.
VINCENT: You don't know the guy in the trunk, either. If it makes you feel better, he was a villain involved in a Continuing Criminal Enterprise.
MAX: Oh, it's okay, then. 'Cause you're just taking out the garbage...
VINCENT: Yeah, like that... But, anyway, nobody gets out of this alive. Even if we quit smoking and cut out red meat. Everybody dies.
VINCENT: Get rid of 'em.
MAX: How?
VINCENT: You're a cabby. Like talk yourself out of a ticket?
MAX: Please. Don't do anything.
VINCENT: Then don't let me get cornered, Max. You don't have the trunk space.
MAX: I can't believe this.
VINCENT: Believe it.
MAX: I'll talk to them, I'll talk to them.
VINCENT: Good luck. You think they got families?
VINCENT: That one's probably married. Think of his kids. His wife's pregnant...
MAX: I'll deal with it. I will, I will...
