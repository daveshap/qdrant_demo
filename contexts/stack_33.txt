iPhone turning off on 10 - 20% and battery percentage not showing right I have an iPhone 5s running iOS 11.0.3. When it's down to about 15%, it dies completely.<br>Can I do something about that?Also, when It's at around 15% and I plug the iPhone into the power supply, it often goes up to 25% instantly.<br>Why is my iPhone doing that?
