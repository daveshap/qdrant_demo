CHRISTY: What? What does she want now? I did the dishes. I oiled the pews. I dusted the hymnals. Two hundred hymnals. Why can't people share?
MARY ROBERT: I... I...
CHRISTY: What?
MARY ROBERT: I... I brought you something.
CHRISTY: A cigarette?
MARY ROBERT: An extra heel of bread. Please take it, you need your strength. You've been working so hard.
CHRISTY: Thanks. So which one are you? Sister Bruce? Sister Doug?
MARY ROBERT: Mary Robert. I'm... Mary Robert.
CHRISTY: Right. Okay. Bob. Nice to know you.
CHRISTY: So, Bob, how long have you been in? St. K's?
MARY ROBERT: Three years. Sister.
CHRISTY: Three years. A rookie.
MARY ROBERT: A novice.
CHRISTY: Yeah, like a learner's permit, right? When do you hit the big time? You know, when do you take the final vows?
