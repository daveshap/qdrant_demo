Not into anything anymore.
I am losing interest in every hobby I pick up. I will completely drop one thinking I will come back to it later. "maybe I just need something new and exciting!" But that usually lasts for a month or two. It's beginning to be a habit of mine. I push so much stuff away, yet I keep around because I do want to finish it. So I feel like I am drowning with missions when I'm in my house. Whenever I try to pick one back up, my eyes get really heavy and I have a hard time staying awake. Sleeping has always been an issue for me though. All I want to do is sleep. When I'm not working, all I really do is sleep, besides waste time on the internet. I'm always hungry too.
