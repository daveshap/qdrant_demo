Adventures in Exam Invigilation
It's exam season and that means exam invigilation/proctoring is in full swing. 

I don't know if every institution relies on graduate students to invigilate undergraduate exams but regardless, I thought that it might be fun to share (read: commiserate) about the strange and funny things students try to pull during exams. 

From yesterday:

* The student who stood up in the middle of their exam, walked up to the front, tapped me on the shoulder and announced, "I ran out of pages in my booklet." Upon handing them a new booklet, I was met with a look of utter incomprehension and the question, "What do I do with this?" 

* The student who, an hour and a half into a two hour exam, asked to borrow an eraser. When I apologised and told them we don't have spare supplies hanging around, they asked instead for a pencil. When I reiterated that we do not have spare supplies on hand for students, they replied, "Well that's too bad. I didn't bring anything to write with." 

* The student who burst into tears when told they couldn't use their laptop during the exam. "But how can I answer anything without Googling it first?!" 

* "Will I get extra time for this?" No, you will not get extra time for having to produce your ID in order to verify you aren't cheating. Just as you will not get extra time for asking to go to the bathroom, asking questions, or requesting more booklets. 

Any fun or strange stories you want to share?
