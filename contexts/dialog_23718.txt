ROLLO: Rog, I gotta talk serious to you. Really. Listen. Ya listening? OK. I want you to come into this with me. To tell the honest-to-God truth, I'm lonely. All Hobbes ever did was run around getting money and phone me in the middle of the night. He wanted you in anyway. That's why we were gonna get together, the three of us. We would have enough to keep us going for at least five years, even with inflation.
ST. LUC: Rollo, you know me. Once a GP, always a GP.
ROLLO: You want to help sick people for the rest of your life? God forbid I should talk you out of it.
ST. LUC: You oughta be careful yourself. Might end up cutting your throat.
ROLLO: It was women did it to Hobbes. Couldn't handle them. That girl, that Annabelle -- talk about crazy projects.
ST. LUC: Who was she?
ROLLO: Aw, he met her when he was lecturing at some private girls' school. They caught him examining her little tits for breast cancer in the faculty lounge. She was twelve. Don't ask. It was craziness, believe me. They used to come here sometimes. Don't ask.
