MRS. LINDNER: Frank Kosinski. Here's the address. Go see him. Ask him.
ELLEN: Thank you. Elisabeth, I didn't mean to...
MRS. LINDNER: That's alright. Don't misunderstand my husband. It's only that he's already had enough problems with this case. And who would believe him if he told the truth?
ELLEN: But what is the truth?
MRS. LINDNER: I don't know all about what happened back then. But it always stood between me and my husband.
