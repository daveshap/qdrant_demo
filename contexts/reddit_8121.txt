Donald Trump has picked Dr. Thomas Price as head of Human and Health Services. What does this mean for American healthcare?
Edit: My apologies for getting the office wrong in the title, am on mobile and typing fast. 

Dr Price is an orthopedic surgeon who has sponsored and written the [Empowering Patients First Act](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empowering_Patients_First_Act) as an alternative to the ACA. He is a member of the GOP [doctors caucus](http://doctorscaucus.roe.house.gov). 

This is a [NYT article](http://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/11/28/us/politics/tom-price-secretary-health-and-human-services.html?_r=0&referer=) on his positions. As well as one from [Fox news](https://www.google.com/amp/www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/11/29/trump-to-nominate-rep-tom-price-for-hhs-secretary-sources-say.amp.html?client=safari)

This [wiki page](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Health_and_Human_Services) explains the role of Secretary of Health and Human Services. 

More specific questions
