DAFFY: Excuse me.
RICHARD: Yes?
DAFFY: I'm Daffy.
RICHARD: Richard. Hi.
DAFFY: Look, I'm sorry to bother you but I was wondering if you could help me out.
RICHARD: Help you out?
DAFFY: Yeah; just ten or fifteen dollars maybe.
RICHARD: I'm sorry, I don't think so.
DAFFY: I'm waiting on some money coming through. It's just that at the moment, you know, I'm short. They're going to chuck me out. On the street in Bangkok, that's bad.
RICHARD: I'm really sorry but I just arrived; I'm on a pretty tight budget myself. I just can't afford it.
DAFFY: Just five dollars, please.
DAFFY: I'll share something with you.
RICHARD: I'm sorry. I can't lend you any money.
