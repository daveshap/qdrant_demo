GENE: My daughter. They have her in a van across the street. They say they'll kill her if I don't do something for them.
HUEY: In twenty-five minutes in the California Ballroom.
GENE: There was a woman. She was trying to help me. I watched him murder her.
HUEY: What are you supposed to do?
GENE: Kill the Governor.
HUEY: I knew I should have packed up and gone home as soon as I got that twenty. What am I supposed to do about this situation?
GENE: One of them is in on it. He might even be in charge. Her Security is in on it. There's only one person I know for sure isn't in on it.
HUEY: Who?
GENE: The Governor. If I could just talk to her...
HUEY: Oh, Jesus ...
GENE: No way, there's nothing you can do to help me.
HUEY: Then why'd you drag me into it?
GENE: It's my kid. I've got to...to somehow...do right by my little girl.
GENE: It's about time I did. I was one of those guys, workaholics. I worked my ass off for them - my wife, my daughter. That's just what I thought I was supposed to do.
HUEY: Yeah, all right, listen...
GENE: So when she wanted a divorce...I was...I didn't know what I'd done wrong. I didn't see it. I didn't see it....
HUEY: Why don't you tell me about the early years some other time?
GENE: I'm sorry. You understand I don't mind dying if I could save my daughter. I mean that.
HUEY: Yeah, now listen. I can't mess with these shoes any more or it's gonna look funny. You go down get yourself something to drink. Make sure Godzilla there, follows you.
GENE: What are you going to do?
