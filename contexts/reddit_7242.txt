Advice for a soon to be “shipping and receiving clerk”?
This week I will be starting a job as a shipping and receiving clerk. As described by my future boss during the interview, I will work in the back garage area where the shipments come in and out. I’ll be the one to direct the truck drivers and such. I’ll also be using a computer software to enter data about shipments that come in and out. It’s hands on, I’ll have to prepare the boxes and such I think.

The reason for this post is that I’d like advice on how to do this job as well as possible. I’d like to get a head start on learning the ins-and-outs before I even begin training so that when I do get trained in I can be as efficient and productive as possible. 

...Basically, I want to learn how to do this job before they teach me in order to make the most of my training.

Any pointers from someone whose worked this position, a similar position, or has worked around someone with this position is greatly appreciated. Thanks!
