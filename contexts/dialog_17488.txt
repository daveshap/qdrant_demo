DREW: I have to go, Bill -- it's been a helluva day. Need a few minutes to sort everything out.
PARRISH: Okay, we'll see you tomorrow.
DREW: Sure.
PARRISH: Why did you go to the hospital?
JOE: I don't know.
PARRISH: You were just curious?
JOE: I guess...
PARRISH: About Susan?
JOE: I wouldn't put it that way.
PARRISH: What way would you put it?
JOE: You tell me, Bill.
PARRISH: How about you telling me? When I ask a simple question, I expect a straight answer. That's what I'm used to. Anybody who doesn't give it to me, I fire.
JOE: Are you going to fire me, Bill?
SUSAN: ...See you tomorrow night.
DREW: Include me out. I've had enough of the conversations.
SUSAN: You don't mean that. You wouldn't disappoint Daddy --
DREW: Daddy'll do fine. Besides, he's got Joe. And so do you.
SUSAN: Drew, you're out of line.
DREW: That may be. But I don't like the fucker. I don't like the way he looks at you and talks to you. And vice versa.
SUSAN: Sorry, but I like the way he looks and talks to me. And vice versa. Okay?
DREW: No, not okay. I thought we had a good thing going here. It shows you never know.
SUSAN: Well... goodnight.
DREW: Yeah. Goodnight.
SUSAN: How long have you been standing there?
JOE: I don't like the way Drew spoken to you. But I feel better about it now because of the way you spoke back.
