What are the pros and cons of using deportation to enforce immigration laws? What, if any, alternatives exist to deal with people who are in the country illegally?
Donald Trump has given orders to ICE to proceed with deporting migrant families that have received final deportation orders. [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/ice-raids-targeting-migrant-families-slated-to-start-sunday-in-major-us-cities/2019/06/21/f2936318-942e-11e9-b570-6416efdc0803_story.html?utm_term=.ae0767d05a84)

Many are critical of these procedures, e.g. attorney general of New York.

As a none-American, Iâ€™m not fully familiar with the American judicial system and te division between state and federal law and enforcement. 

My question here is, other than deporting people who are in the country illegally, what options does the federal government have to enforce immigration law? In what ways are those options better or worse than the current actions?
