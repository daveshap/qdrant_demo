Hello, I was told my entire department will be outsourced in August.
I'm new here so bear with me. I was just told a couple of hours ago that my entire department is getting outsourced. I've been with this company for five years and I will get severance. My question is, what are the best methods nowadays to look for a job? I've seen linked in and other apps. The situation with covid-19 isn't helping my anxiety either. I'm in New Jersey by the way.
