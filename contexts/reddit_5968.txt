i have a learning disability and dropped out of high school. what jobs are available for people like me?
i know this will open me up to criticism but i really want advice! i have an intellectual disability and ive always suffered educationally. it is too much for me and i stopped participating in high school! 

i turn 18 next year and i really want to be independent. i am kind of an immature person but i really am determined to push past that and make a living for myself. i want to be able to have an apartment and live on my own and just be an adult!

the only job i hear thrown around for people in my situation is mcdonalds. i dont have an aversion to the idea of working there, but is that my only option? do i have any others? i struggle a lot with social interactions however i know socializing is very necessary in a job so i am open to jobs where you might have to be social.

i also would like to know what the best paying may be? i know that any job a person like me can get isnt going to make me rich, but im sure 7 dollars an hour and 10 dollars an hour make a worlds difference to somebody less fortunate with money.

also, benefits are a thing but im not sure how those work? do they play into this at all? is somebody like me even qualified for them?

i live in america by the way on the west coast if it matters. i come from a pretty well off background so i know i wont get to experience "luxury" ike i do now, but thats reality for some people and it may just be mine too. also im sorry if this post is in a bad format, im not really somebody who makes submissions. :)
