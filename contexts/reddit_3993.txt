Do guys like it when it when girls pay / are assertive?
I'm going on a date and I kinda want to switch things up, but I'm not sure how he'll act?

My ex is dating again, so I guess I've stopped feeling this guilt and I'm going to give it a try too. My friends have set me up on multiple dates after my breakup (before I was ready to date) and this is my first time being asked out by someone on their own terms!

He seems kind of prideful, but I kinda want to catch him off guard. I've gone out with him before as friends, but this is the first time we're labeling it as a date. But yeah I want to pay for the first date and plan it, which is exciting for me because I've been becoming more assertive recently and its very empowering. Do you guys think he would like that or will he be scared away by it? i don't want to come on too strong :-(

Edit: He's asked me out multiple times before and I'm finally giving it a shot, but I'm not sure what his expectations are
