I feel like an underpaid babysitter for adults who aren’t actually adults yet
This is my first summer as a grad student. I am in biology and I love TAing over the school year, but the summer has been so stressful and awful. My PI hired 8 undergrads as research assistants this summer but after the first couple weeks, she stopped coming in to manage them and the responsibility switched to me and the other grad student working in the lab. 

This is more of a rant if anything and to see if anyone else has this issue. It has been so draining trying to do my own work as well as constantly having to find something for the undergrads to do. I feel like a manager but without the perks of an actual manager- no one actually listens to me and there’s no discipline from my PI. These undergrads have messed up my research several times, they refuse to do the work I give them, they pester for different tasks, they just seem to endlessly pester me every day but they never actually listen to what I say. 

The final straw has been this week where I went on vacation for the week. It was approved by my PI, everyone knew I was leaving, yet at 9:05 am on the dot Monday morning I receive two frantic emails from an undergrad and my PI. Both demanding data for an undergrad project due two days later. Data I didn’t have, data I couldn’t send (no wifi) even if I did have it, for a project an undergrad procrastinated and didn’t mention until the last minute. I was roadtripping in the western USA where phone service is spotty and nonexistent but I still felt obligated to spend 1-2 hours typing data on my phone to send an email to both of them. 

I have been dealing with this for 8+ weeks and just wanted to vent & see if anyone else deals with this. I thought this would end after the summer but I just got an email from my PI stating she’s hiring 5 undergrads for the school year as well. Thank god this is just a masters degree!
