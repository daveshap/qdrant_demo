My best friend made new friends and now ignores me
She and I have been very close best friends for over five years now, and she helped me through a lot of tough stuff at home. However, since joining Sixth Form she’s been hanging out more with some new friends and I feel like she only hangs out with me when she has to. I know this sounds like I’m really clingy but I’m not, I want her to have loads of friends and be happy. But there’s been multiple occasions where she’s agreed to meet me but gone off with those guys and left me waiting, and she never messages me anymore and rarely replies when I message her despite being on her phone all the time. She always tells them her plans and leaves me in the dark, for example she didn’t come in the other day because she was sick but didn’t tell me so left me waiting for her again but told all her new friends. Even today, we both only had one lesson so have been doing independent work in the common room, and she’s barely said two words to me despite being sat right next to her but has been talking non stop to her friend sat on her other side. I left to go have some time with my thoughts and when I came back she hadn’t even noticed I’d gone. I know some of you would say just drop her, but I’ve never been as close to someone as I was with her and honestly I don’t have any other friends to turn to. I want to still be her friend. Any advice?
