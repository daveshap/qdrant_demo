ANNIE: M'm, I don't know, sometimes I ask myself how I'd stand up under torture.

ALVY: Yeah, 'cause it's supposed to.
ANNIE: Alvy, I...
ALVY: What-what-what-what's the matter?
ANNIE: I-you know, I don't wanna.
ALVY: What-what-I don't... It's not natural! We're sleeping in a bed together. You know, it's been a long time.
