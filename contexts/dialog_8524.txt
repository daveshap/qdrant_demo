DECK SERGEANT: Commander Skywalker hasn't come through the south entrance, sir. Maybe he slipped by without checking in.
HAN: Not likely! Where are the speeders?
DECK SERGEANT: We haven't got them adapted to this cold yet ...
HAN: We'll have to go out on Tauntauns.
DECK SERGEANT: The temperature is dropping too fast.
HAN: You bet it is ... and Luke's out in it.
DECK SERGEANT: The night storms will start before you can reach the first marker.
HAN: Then I'll see you in Hell.
LUKE: I can't ...
BEN: You must. Luke, look at me!
BEN: You must survive, Luke.
LUKE: I'm cold ... so cold ...
BEN: You must go to the Dagobah System ... There you will learn from one who taught me: Yoda, the Jedi Master.
LUKE: Ben ... Ben ...
BEN: Luke ... you are the only hope.
