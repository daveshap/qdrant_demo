EPPS: We should head Northeast.
JAEGER: Northeast? That's away from the Hummer; further into Iraqi.
EPPS: There's another pass on the photo. We can avoid that narrow one we had to cross on the way up, and it should get us back down.
JAEGER: It should, or it will? Least going back the way we came we know what we're up against.
EPPS: You think you can make that pass weighted down when you almost fell the first time you're wrong, and you're not going to take my share of the gold with you trying it. We're heading Northeast.
WES: You've got an awful lot of orders in you. Always giving orders.
EPPS: I out rank you, that's why.
WES: In the service you do, but we're not particularly in the service right now. Way I see it, what we're doing, that doesn't particularly give you the right to toss orders around.
EPPS: We been down this road. I told you how it is. Unless you feel like there's something you want to do about it...
WES: What if I do?
