FERRARI: Shall we draw up the papers, or is our handshake good enough?
RICK: It's certainly not good enough. But since I'm in a hurry, it'll have to do.
FERRARI: Ah, to get out of Casablanca and go to America! You're a lucky man.
RICK: Oh, by the way, my agreement with Sam's always been that he gets twenty- five percent of the profits. That still goes.
FERRARI: Hmmm. I happen to know that he gets ten percent. But he's worth twenty- five.
RICK: And Abdul and Carl and Sacha, they stay with the place, or I don't sell.
FERRARI: Of course they stay. Rick's wouldn't be Rick's without them.
RICK: Well, so long.
RICK: Don't forget, you owe Rick's a hundred cartons of American cigarettes.
FERRARI: I shall remember to pay it... to myself.
