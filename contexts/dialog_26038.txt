LENNY: Who's the new side of beef in Tran's posse?
MACE: Guy named Wade Beemer. Used to be a running back for the Rams in '96 and '97.
LENNY: Rams... that's football, right?
MACE: Forget her.
LENNY: She still loves me.
MACE: She thinks you're a bucket of dog vomit. Trust me on this.
LENNY: She's my destiny.
MACE: Destiny? You living in a perfume commercial? She's a hard-climber that dropped you like a used tampon when she got a better ride.
LENNY: You'll see.
TRAN: You come to peddle me some tapes, Lenny? For old time's sake? Make a couple bucks for the holidays?
LENNY: You're not a client anymore, Tran. I wouldn't sell you the sweat off a dead dog's balls.
TRAN: I already got everything I need from you.
FAITH: Cut it out, Tran.
LENNY: Too bad about your guy Jeriko. Tough break.
TRAN: Show a little respect, Nero. The man was an important artist.
LENNY: Yeah, important for your label. Which no doubt is why you're in mourning. Don't worry, his records'll sell out now he's dead. You'll make out.
TRAN: I always do.
LENNY: Faith, can I talk to you a second?
FAITH: I don't think that's a good idea, Lenny.
LENNY: I just got to talk to you for one second.
TRAN: About what?
LENNY: That would be between me and Faith, wouldn't it?
