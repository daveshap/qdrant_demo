In an NPN transistor, why doesn't current flow without applying a base voltage? In an NPN transistor, why isn't a typical C-E voltage sufficient to overcome the internal resistance of NPN junction directly? Since we only need 0.7V to overcome the PN junction from the Base to Emitter, isn\u2019t that the same as applying a similar (or slightly higher) voltage from Collector to Emitter to achieve the same outcome?Thinking of it an electronic level, the key thing you\u2019re trying to do is \u2018push\u2019 electrons into an area of negative charge \u2013 i.e. the Collector. I don\u2019t see why the existing potential difference from Emitter to Collector doesn\u2019t do this without a base potential being applied at all.
