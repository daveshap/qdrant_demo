JILL: Are we going in this?
WADE: Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine.
JILL: It's pretty old.
WADE: It belongs to Pop.
JILL: Pop?
WADE: Grandpa. My father. It's his.
JILL: Oh.
WADE: How about a Big Mac?
JILL: Mommy won't let me eat fast food. You know that. It's bad for you.
WADE: C'mon, we can always sneak a Big Mac. And a cherry turnover. Your favorite. What do you say?
JILL: No.
WADE: What do you want, then?
JILL: Nothing.
WADE: You can't have nothing, Jill. We need lunch. Mr. Pizza?
JILL: Same thing, Daddy. Mommy says --
WADE: I know what Mommy says. I'm in charge today, though.
JILL: Okay. So we'll get what you want. What do you want?
WADE: Nothing, I guess. I guess I can wait till we get home. Maybe we'll stop by Wickham's for a hamburger when we get to Lawford. That suit you? You always like Wickham's.
JILL: Okay.
WADE: Fine.
