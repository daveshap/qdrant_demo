I (31F) finally got a second date! After none for years!
I just wanted to express my joy. See I've been online dating for over a year and been on at least half a dozen dates. Not a single one of those resulted in a second date. One guy even came to visit me from three hours away, then ghosted me. I couldn't figure out what was so wrong with me. Another guy kissed me on the first date then abruptly cut things off before a second.... Sigh.

So I still don't know what's wrong with me, but at least one idiot (28M) wants to see me again.
