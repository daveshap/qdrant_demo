SUGAI: I took Kobo from the street. I gave him a home, a future... But my ways were too slow for him... I served seven years in prison for my boss when I was a young man. Kobo wouldn't serve seven minutes for his Oyabun. He was supposed to take over this syndicate when I retired.
NICK: I want him.
SUGAI: He'll be dealt with.
SUGAI: Our associates in New York were close to closing a deal with us.
NICK: The families who control the casinos?
SUGAI: Yes. Unlike our syndicates, your criminals don't understand the words 'honor' and 'duty'... We can't afford not to deal with them.
SUGAI: Imagine if your families could pay their gambling and drug debts with perfect counterfeit bought for cents on the dollar.
NICK: The Feds would be onto you in a month.
SUGAI: Not with these bills. And even if it only took them six months, do you know what our profit margin would be?
NICK: Why tell me this?
SUGAI: The other plate is currently in New York, in the hands of Kobo's man. Find it for me.
NICK: You trust me?
SUGAI: I'll pay you.
NICK: With these?
SUGAI: Swiss bank deposit. Gold bullion. Whatever you want. You know the city and the police.
NICK: If I say no?
SUGAI: You're smarter than Kobo. You know the price of deceit. Think about it.
NICK: I don't have to.
