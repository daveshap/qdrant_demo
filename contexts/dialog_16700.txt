MONICA: It just isn't.
QUINCY: Because I'm kinda feeling that way, too.
MONICA: You had a rough couple years, that's all.
QUINCY: That a nice way of saying I rode the bench?
MONICA: And you tore up your knee. Rehab is tough.
QUINCY: Nah. I haven't dribbled a ball in four and a half months. Maybe I miss some of the attention, but besides that...
MONICA: You're serious.
QUINCY: Seems like I needed a ball when I was trying to be like my pops...or trying to be better than him. Now, I kinda think I need to try something else.
MONICA: Like what?
QUINCY: Maybe go back to school.
MONICA: Wow.
QUINCY: I mean, Kyra hasn't heard the school thing yet. She'll probably say it's the painkillers talking.
MONICA: It's a trip, you know? When you're a kid, you see the life you want, and it never crosses your mind that it's not gonna turn out that way.
QUINCY: So why'd you give up ball?
MONICA: Why do you keep asking me that?
QUINCY: Cause I don't get it.
MONICA: Something was just missing.
QUINCY: What?
MONICA: It doesn't matter, alright. Just leave it alone.
QUINCY: Find.
CAMILLE: So you're still breast-feeding?
LENA: The doctor said it was okay. Anyway, I'm still trying to lose some of this baby fat.
CAMILLE: You might want to put a jacket on him, it's getting cold.
LENA: He's fine.
CAMILLE: Okay.
