I really just wish someone gave a fuck about me
This is my throwaway account that’s why it has jake Paul as the name it’s a joke 


I remember when I was a kid and I thought I’d have a wife or girlfriend when I grew up, what a fucking joke. Instead here I am stuck in my fucking room because of the fucking dumbass quarantine and no school just wanting to kill myself because no one gives a shit about me

I’ve started texting this girl that I asked out and she of course rejected me because I’m a lowlife piece of shit. She always hits me up first and she’s the only reason basically I have any hope at all except deep down I know she doesn’t give a fuck about me and will never love a useless loser like me

Because of the fucking pandemic I don’t even have soccer, the only thing that kept me going every week, the only time when I feel myself and can express myself and don’t want to fucking kill myself. My best friend has just ghosted me the last few weeks and I’m completely alone, the only person that even texts me is this girl but she won’t hang with me and even if she wanted to she couldn’t because of the quarantine. 

I’m not gonna make it through 3 more weeks of this I just wish I had a gf who cares about me and would hold me close and tell me it’s gonna be ok and I wish I could say this stuff to my friends but I’m a man and I can’t show emotion or I look like a pussy, I just want to cuddle with a girl and be warm and happy I’m such a loser idk I just want to be happy again it’s been so long




BIG UPDATE: ASKED HER OUT SHE SAID SHE LIKED ME TOO BUT WE UNDER QUARANTINE LMAO
