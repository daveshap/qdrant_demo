How to get a friend to eat when they are starving themselves from depression..
Someone I know is going through a really tough time in their life and they have fallen into a really deep depression. They’ve been hospitalized because they starved themselves so much and have lost 30 pounds in 3 months. They ate a bit when my friend was with them and it seems drinking is a little easier at times but they are really lacking in good sustenance.
For anyone who has faced this or knows some who has, what have you used to keep yourself more healthy during this time? I saw that some people use supplements like Soylent when they get into those states but I’ve never been in this position and want to do everything I can to help and keep them as healthy as possible. Thank you 🙏🏼
