Paycheck Didn’t Go into my account, but I’m not only OK, I was able to help someone who wasn’t
A recent snafu with a wire transfer caused our biweekly paychecks to not be deposited on schedule. In the past, this would have been a disaster for me. Automatic bill payments would have bounced, and I wouldn’t have money for groceries. 

Luckily, I have my emergency fund in place, and I’m fine until things get fixed next week. And, because I’ve been in tough times before, I realized a new coworker might not be ok. He’d been out of work until recently, and wasn’t likely to have a cushion in place. 

I was able to quietly reach out to him and give him some money to get him through. After so many years of not having my shit together, it was nice to not have everything implode when I missed a paycheck.

Edit: Thank you for the gold :)
