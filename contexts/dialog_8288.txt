KATHARINE: Please don't move me. It hurts too much.
ALMÁSY: We've got to get you out of here.
KATHARINE: It hurts too much.
ALMÁSY: I know, darling, I'm sorry.
KATHARINE: Why did you hate me?
ALMÁSY: What?
KATHARINE: Don't you know you drove everybody mad?
ALMÁSY: Don't talk.
KATHARINE: You speak so many bloody languages and you never want to talk.
ALMÁSY: You're wearing the thimble.
KATHARINE: Of course. You idiot. I always wear it. I've always worn it. I've always loved you.
KATHARINE: It's so cold.
ALMÁSY: I know. I'm sorry. I'll make a fire. I'll be back.
KATHARINE: Don't leave me!
ALMÁSY: I'm just going to find things for the fire.
KATHARINE: Shall we be all right?
ALMÁSY: Yes. Absolutely.
KATHARINE: Oh dear.
ALMÁSY: Listen to me, Katharine. You've broken your ankle and I'm going to have to try and bind it. I think your wrist might be broken, too - and some ribs, which is why it's hurting you to breathe. I'm going to have to walk to El Taj. Given all the traffic in the desert these days I should bump into one army or another before I reach there - or Fenelon-Barnes and his camel. And then I'll be back and we'll be fine, and I'll never leave you.
KATHARINE: Do you promise? I wouldn't want to die here. I wouldn't want to die in the desert. I've always had a rather elaborate funeral in mind, with particular hymns. Very English. And I know exactly where I want to be buried. In our garden. Where I grew up. With a view of the sea. So promise me you'll come back for you.
ALMÁSY: I promise I'll come back. I promise I'll never leave you. And there's plenty of water and food. You can have a party.
ALMÁSY: And a good read. Don't waste it.
KATHARINE: Thank you. Will you bury Geoffrey? I know he's dead.
ALMÁSY: I'm sorry, Katharine.
KATHARINE: I know.
ALMÁSY: Every night I cut out my heart but in the morning it was full again.
ALMÁSY: Tell me about your garden.
KATHARINE: Our Garden, our garden - not so much the garden, but the copse alongside it, wild, a secret way plunging down to the shore and then nothing but water between you and France. The Devil's Chimney it was called - The Devil's Chimney, I don't know why. Darling. My darling.
