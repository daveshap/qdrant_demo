Are there any well paying jobs, that don't involve sitting around in an office?
I've always wanted to go to university, so I can get a job that pays me well, but to be honest, I don't want to spend my life sitting around in an office doing who knows what. I've gotten to a point where I feel like I'd rather work on a construction site for less than minimum wage than do anything involving IT and/or offices.

I like drawing, and being creative, and while it's still an office job somewhat, I'd actually be interested in working for a game company, to do art for them. 

I don't know if I'd be able to find a job as an artist though, so I'd like to ask what other options I have in case that doesn't work out
