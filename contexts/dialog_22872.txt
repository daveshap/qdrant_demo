REIBEN: Captain, could you please explain the math of this mission to me?
MILLER: Sure, what do you want to know?
REIBEN: Well, sir, in purely arithmetic terms, since when does six equal one? What's the sense in risking six guys to save one?
MILLER: Ours is not to reason why.
REIBEN: Huh?
MILLER: Never mind, don't worry, we'll pick up this kid, high-tail it back to division, everything'll work out fine.
REIBEN: I'd much rather die in Caen than Ramelle, sir. It's a personal thing.
MILLER: Reiben, there's a fairly good chance you're not going to die at all.
REIBEN: Easy for you to say, sir. Fucking James Ryan, I'd like to wring his fucking neck.
SARGE: Jesus, Reiben, think of the poor bastard's mother.
REIBEN: Hey, I got a mother. Jackson, you got a mother?
JACKSON: Last I knew.
REIBEN: Wade, Sarge, Corporal Insect, all of us, hell, I'll bet even the Captain has a mother.
REIBEN: Well, maybe not the Captain, but the rest of us have mothers.
MILLER: You have orders, too.
JACKSON: Sir, I have an opinion on this matter.
MILLER: I'd love to hear it.
JACKSON: Seems to me, Cap'n, this mission is a serious misallocation of valuable military resources. Miller Go on.
