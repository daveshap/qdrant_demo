ETHAN: Fight a bit of a cold..
AMBROSE: And you're happy about that?
ETHAN: Beats fighting the flu, I'm here to tell you.
AMBROSE: You know, that was the hardest part of having to portray you. Grinning like an idiot every fifteen minutes.
ETHAN: I would've thought the hardest part was exercising restraint. Curbing that pressing need of your to get your gun off. You were in such a hurry to knock off that 747, you never figured out where the virus really was.
AMBROSE: I knew where it was.
ETHAN: Oh. then you knew the only way could smuggle the live virus to the CDC scientists in Atlanta was by injecting himself and using his own bloodstream as a Petri dish, doing it inside of twenty hours so he could take the anti-virus and still have it be effective. You knew that while you were knocking him off and destroying the very thing you came for.
