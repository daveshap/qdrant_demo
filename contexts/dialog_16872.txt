BEMBRY: The body is a holy repository.
MALCOLM: I will not touch the white man's poison: his drugs, his liquor, his carrion, his women.
BEMBRY: A Muslim must be strikingly upright. Outstanding. So those in the darkness can see the power of the light.
MALCOLM: I will do it.
BEMBRY: But the key to Islam is submission. That is why twice daily we turn to Mecca, to the Holy of Holies, to pray. We bend our knees in submission.
MALCOLM: I can't.
BEMBRY: For evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt, implore His forgiveness, is the hardest thing on earth --
MALCOLM: I want to, Bembry, but I can't.
BEMBRY: -- the hardest and the greatest.
MALCOLM: I can't.
BEMBRY: For evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt, implore His forgiveness, is the hardest thing on earth --
MALCOLM: I want to, Bembry, but I can't.

MALCOLM: I don't know what to say to Allah.
BEMBRY: Have you ever bent your knees, Malcolm?
MALCOLM: Yeah. When I was picking a lock to rob somebody's house.
BEMBRY: Tell Him that.
MALCOLM: I don't know how.
BEMBRY: You can grovel and crawl for sin, but not to save your soul. Pick the lock, Malcolm; pick it.
MALCOLM: I want to. God knows I want to.
