Struggling to find jobs with an English Degree
Last year I graduated with an English degree. I had a temp administrative assistant job where I went to college for three months, but then they filled the position. Since then I have been unemployed and really struggling. 

I had one interview a couple of weeks ago. I didn't get that job. I have another interview coming up this week for another administrative job. I really hope I get this one, but I'm not too confident about it given my luck this past year. 

Aside from administrative work, I'm struggling to come up with jobs that I would be suited for given my degree. 

I don't want to teach, and I feel like writing/editing aren't good options since they would need to be freelance/don't pay that well, even though I think I would enjoy doing those. 

I know I made a bad decision in what I studied, and now I have to live with it, but I'm finding it very difficult to get along. 

Does anyone have suggestions for what I might be able to do with this degree, besides burn it for warmth?
