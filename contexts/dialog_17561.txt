NATALIE: I did exactly what you told me. I went to		 * Dodd and I said that I didn't have				* Jimmy's money, or any drugs, that this Teddy must have taken everything.
LEONARD: And what did he say?
NATALIE: He didn't believe me. He said that if I don't get him the money tomorrow he's gonna kill me. Then he started hitting me.
LEONARD: Where is he?
NATALIE: What are you gonna do?
LEONARD: I'll go see him.
NATALIE: And?
LEONARD: Give him some bruises of his own and tell him to look for a guy called Teddy.
NATALIE: He'll kill you, Lenny.
LEONARD: My wife used to call me Lenny.
NATALIE: Yeah?
LEONARD: Yeah, I hated it.
NATALIE: This guy's dangerous, let's think of something else.
