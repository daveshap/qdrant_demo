MR. KELCHER: Young lady, you're drunk!
PEGGY: Just a little. I've had a tough day.
MR. KELCHER: I don't see the humor in this. Go to your room immediately. You're grounded.
PEGGY: Grounded? Ha! The story of my life. I don't wanna go to my room. I wanna import Japanese cars. I wanna go to Liverpool and discover the Beatles.
MRS. KELCHER: Jack, take it easy. She gave blood at school today. Maybe she's just a little lightâ€”headed.
MR. KELCHER: This is not giving blood. This is drunk.
PEGGY: Dad, I never knew you had a sense of humor.
MR. KELCHER: Evelyn, put her to bed.
MRS. KELCHER: My little baby. Don't try to grow up so fast.
PEGGY: Oh Mom, I forgot you were ever so young.
MRS. KELCHER: A new car. We can't afford a new car.
MR. KELCHER: Don't worry, it's just a seasonal slump.
MRS. KELCHER: You have four seasons, you have four slumps.
