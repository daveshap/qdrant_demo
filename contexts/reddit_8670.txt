Hillary Clinton is often described as a "moderate" or "centrist." Does the evidence support this?
Going in to this election, my personal impression of Clinton was that she was a liberal. Not extremely liberal, but not ["center left"] (https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/06/13/hillary-clinton-the-center-lefts-champion/) and certainly not ["a Republican in Democrats' clothing,"] (http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tony-brasunas/there-is-a-moderate-republican-in-this-race_b_9704194.html) as she is sometimes described today. After doing research, my perception of her as a liberal seems to be more accurate, based on actual evidence.

Evidence: looking at her senate voting record at [dwnominate,] (http://www.voteview.com/dwnl_for_friends.html) we can see that Clinton was more liberal than 70% of all Democrats and 85% of all house members in her last term in the senate. If you feel that's too small a sample size, we can look at her public statements over the course of her entire career. [Ontheissues.org] (http://www.ontheissues.org/hillary_clinton.htm) keeps track of public statements by politicians and rates them on a left-right scale; by this analysis, she qualifies as a "hard-core liberal." [This point is also emphasized in a post at fivethirtyeight.] (http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/hillary-clinton-was-liberal-hillary-clinton-is-liberal/)  (link provided by /u/Phantazein.)

The purpose of this thread is not really to convince everyone that Clinton is an uber-liberal (and further, it's not clear that this is necessarily a good or bad thing), but rather, to discuss the disparity between her image as a moderate/centrist and her actual voting record and her public statements, which look pretty solidly liberal to me. 

Why does this disparity exist, and what does it tell us?
