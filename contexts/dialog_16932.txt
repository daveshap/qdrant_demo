CREASY: Remember you asked me what state I was from?
PINTA: Yes.
CREASY: Where you're from isn't so much about geography; it's about events. Where you're from is what happened to you.
PINTA: Good things happen, too, Creasy. Like meeting me.
CREASY: I guess that really does make me a hard case.
PINTA: Do you have a girlfriend, Creasy?
CREASY: No.
PINTA: Did you used to?
CREASY: Yeah. Two or three.
