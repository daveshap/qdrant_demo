Coworker forgot to cover my shift, being written as “no call, no show”
I have been working in a bar-type restaurant for the past year without being late and considerably a good behavior. The work place doesn’t have strict policies so the managers and owner often like to blame employees if something doesn’t go right. We do not have a printed schedule, although we have a paper absences for employees to write down and sign, it isn’t always being written down and often times employees and even managers switch schedules without manager’s approval or the paper agreement.

Today I got a call from my manager because my coworker who was supposed to cover my shift didn’t show up. I called her only for her to say she forgot. My manager will give us both a written warning for doing a no call, no show without a written agreement so the liability belongs to both of us, particularly on me because nobody can contact my coworker. Other people say it’s partially my fault for not reminding her. How do I go on about this? I have had bad breakdowns because my workplace can often be a toxic environment but I never expected to be treated like this. I’m unsure how to touch on this matter to my manager and boss because this is the first time this kind of event has ever happened in the workplace.
