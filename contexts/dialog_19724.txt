NIXON: We lost ...
PAT: I know ...
NIXON: It's hard to lose ...
PAT: It makes us human ...
NIXON: It's not fair, Buddy. I can take the insults; I can take the name-calling. But I can't take the losing. I hate it.
PAT: We don't have to put ourselves through this again, Dick.
NIXON: What do you mean? We worked for it. We earned it. It's ours.
PAT: It is. We know that. And it's enough that we know. Just think of the girls. They're still young. We never see them. I lost my parents. I don't want them to lose theirs; I don't want them to grow up without a mother and father ...
NIXON: Maybe I should get out of the game. What do you think, Buddy? Go back to being a lawyer and end up with something solid, some money at the end of the line ... You know, I keep thinking of my old man tonight. He was a failure, too.
PAT: You're not a failure, Dick.
NIXON: You know how much money he had in the bank when he died? Nothing. He was so damned honest ... But I miss him. I miss him a hell of a lot.
RICHARD: What'd he say?
HAROLD: What do you think? He said in life there's no free ride.
RICHARD: What'd you say?
HAROLD: I said I didn't need a free ride. I need a suit.
RICHARD: Oh, no, Harold. He doesn't respond well to humor. Maybe if you talk to Mother she can ...
HAROLD: I'd rather get a whipping than have another talk with her. Anything but a talk with her.
