Brain has just stopped working
So I'm in the first semester of my PhD in physics (which has been a nightmare so far) and I find myself looking at every homework assignment and test and just having no idea how to even start or what to do next. It's like my brain has just given up and had decided not to even try. Some of these problems I could even do at one point. Has anyone else had this kind of thing happen and if so, how did you deal with it?
