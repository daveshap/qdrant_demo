DIXIE: Yo.
CASE: How's the ice break?
DIXIE: Slow, but good. I got a nice safe blind spot going. C'mon.
DIXIE: Take a look. Son of a bitch won't feel a thing until it's too late.
CASE: How long, Dixie?
DIXIE: Fifty-seven minutes twelve seconds.
CASE: Not good enough, man. They planted something inside me. I'm on my own countdown.
DIXIE: How much time you got left?
CASE: Less than thirty minutes.
DIXIE: Meet me back here in twenty-five. We'll kick this open if we can. But, Case... you need that access code or you'll just fry inside.
CASE: Don't worry, Dix. I'm on a roll.
DIXIE: You'd better be, Bro. You better be.
