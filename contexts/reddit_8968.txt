A Resource Guide for Building Your Fact-Based Opinion
Hi all,

Are you tired of getting your information from the same old news source? Feeling down about how difficult it can be to find reliable information? Do you want to form a political opinion, but just don't know whether the information you're reading is reliable?

We're here to help. At NeutralPolitics, our service representatives are at work identifying educational resources and unbiased data sets so that you can spend your time doing what matters: learning about political topics and digging through numbers so that you can write the perfect response to that one post that you saw.

Special thanks to /u/AFreebornManoftheUSA, who inspired this guide with a message suggesting that we include many of the primary U.S. data sources listed below to the sidebar, where we have added this guide for easy reference in the future.

##Educational Websites

* **[U.S. Congress Video Series on the Legislative Process](https://www.congress.gov/legislative-process)**: Nine-video series that breaks down the details of how Congress works. No "I'm a Bill" music video to be found, unfortunately, but still quite useful.
