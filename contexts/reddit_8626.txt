Off Year Election Night Megathread
So it is election day for most (all?) of the US today.  As is election tradition we shall be doing a megathread here.  

The marquee race of the night is the Virginia governor's race where [polls have shown a tight race with a small lead for Democrat Ralph Northham over Republican Ed Gillespie.](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2017/governor/va/virginia_governor_gillespie_vs_northam-6197.html)

Also there is a gubernatorial race in New Jersey where [Democrat Phil Murphy has polled well ahead of Republican Kim Guadagno](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2017/governor/nj/new_jersey_governor_guadagno_vs_murphy-6187.html)

Outside those states, there is a very interesting DA's race [in Philadelphia](https://whyy.org/articles/philadelphians-prepare-select-new-district-attorney/) where the Democratic candidate is running on a very strongly anti-mass-incarceration platform.  There's also a referendum on holding a [New York Constitutional Convention](https://ballotpedia.org/New_York_Proposal_1,_Constitutional_Convention_Question_(2017\)) and a referendum in Maine on [expanding Medicaid, which the legislature tried to do but which was vetoed by Gov. LePage.](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/11/07/562323124/maine-voters-will-decide-if-they-want-more-access-to-medicaid)

In Washington State there is [a State Senate race which would determine if Democrats get unified control of the State government.](https://www.npr.org/2017/11/06/561554801/millions-of-dollars-pour-into-washington-state-special-election)

I'll keep a running tally going in various races, and also will be happy to add other races of interest people mention below.

[The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/11/07/how-to-watch-election-night-2017-hour-by-hour/?hpid=hp_hp-top-table-low_hourbyhour-12p%3Ahomepage%2Fstory&utm_term=.eab43621abff) also has a list of races to watch and poll closing times for them.

Also for the headline race of the night in Virginia, [here's a link to the New York Times' live results page.](https://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/virginia-governor-election-gillespie-northam)

**7:10 PM EST**  Polls closed in VA about 10 min ago, though no results yet.  [Exit poll says Northam by 5](http://fivethirtyeight.com/live-blog/2017-election-live-coverage-results/?lpup=19559644#livepress-update-19559644) for what that's worth.

**7:24 PM EST** Something appears to be badly wrong with the NYT results page and it is displaying numbers which quite literally don't add up.  [Try the Washington Post's instead.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/2017-election-results/virginia/?hpid=hp_hp-top-table-high_va-results-button%3Ahomepage%2Fstory&utm_term=.222d69bd0f2d)

**7:30 PM EST** NYT seems to have sorted out their bug.

**7:35 PM EST**  Lots of results coming in VA now.  Northam seems to be doing better than the rest of the Democratic ticket there, and is performing very strongly where he needs to.  Looks like Northam is going to win it, but the other races for Lt Gov and AG may be closer.

**7:54 PM EST** NYT estimator has Northam at +8 median outcome and Gillespie well outside the cone of probability.  I expect we'll be seeing networks call it soon.  And if Northam does pull a +8 victory, he should be accompanied by the rest of his ticket, who seem to be getting 2 points or so less than him margin-wise.

**8:02 PM EST**  Polls have closed in Maine, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania.  Looks like a Democratic rout in Virginia, with [huge swings in the House of Delegates as well.](http://fivethirtyeight.com/live-blog/2017-election-live-coverage-results/?lpup=19636144#livepress-update-19636144)  Networks called NJ for Murphy at polls close.

**8:14 PM EST** Networks calling VA for Northam.  Looking downballot in VA, I am seeing about 15 House of Delegates seats where Democrats are leading Republican incumbents, though without checking anything other than lead at the moment.  Democrats would need to take 16 seats to take the House of Delegates.

**8:16 PM EST**  One of those changes in the VA House of Delegates is [Danica Roem, who becomes the first transgender person elected to the VA state legislature.](http://fivethirtyeight.com/live-blog/2017-election-live-coverage-results/?lpup=13214256#livepress-update-13214256)

**8:24 PM EST**  Looks like Democrats are leading to [take 18 seats in the House of Delegates,](http://fivethirtyeight.com/live-blog/2017-election-live-coverage-results/?lpup=20841643#livepress-update-20841643) though some of those are still quite close.

**8:36 PM EST** It seems Democrats need 17 seats to take the House of Delegates because I am bad at math. Also Maine vote looks even right now, but heavily concentrated in rural areas reporting, so it might end up as a blowout yet.  Yes Mediciad expansion leading a bit.

**8:44 PM EST** President Trump has made his first over-140-character tweet, [and it was criticism of Gillespie.](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/928074747316928513)

**8:49 PM EST**  Krasner [is winning](http://phillyelectionresults.com/) the Philly DA race handily so far.

**9:05 PM EST** Polls are now closed in New York.   Forgot to mention there's a NYC mayoral race, but it's not expected to be close.

**9:15 PM EST** With about 1/3 reporting, the Maine Medicaid referendum looks on track to be approved easily.

**9:34 PM EST** Looks like the New York ConCon is going down in flames.  80/20 against right now.

**10:13 PM EST** Maine Medicaid vote has been called for 'yes' by the Associated Press.  Utah 3rd congressional district (Jason Chaffetz' old seat) looks like a hold for Republicans.

**10:53 PM EST** Looks like the VA House of Delegates is going to end up in recounts and be very close on control.  Anyone know what happens there if it's exactly 50 R 50 D when the dust settles?  Also only notable race still outstanding seems to be the WA state senate race, where polls close in 5 minutes.

**11:01 PM EST** The new Republican congressman from Utah is Provo Mayor John Curtis, one of whose notable prior accomplishments is [replacing the godawful flag of Provo.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Provo,_Utah)  Seriously.  [Look at this flag.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Provo,_Utah#/media/File:Flag_of_Provo,_Utah_(1985-2015\).svg)  (Yes, I am violating the image linking rules and the neutrality rules.  But my god that flag sucks.

**11:16 PM EST**  Ok, Provo flag rant over.  Looks like [Democrats are winning in the first round of results in the Washington State Senate race to decide control of the chamber.](http://results.vote.wa.gov/results/current/Legislative-District-45-State-Senator.html)

**11:36 PM EST** Gonna end the tick tock here I think.  Big night for Democrats overall, and it will probably take a few days to sort out who controls the VA House of Delegates.  If anyone wants to make a NP post about how that works in a 50/50 tie that might be a good idea wink wink nudge nudge.

Goodnight all.
