HOWARD: Where do you live, Miss Hankshaw?
SISSY: I'm staying with the Countess.
HOWARD: I know, but where do you reside when you aren't visiting New York?
SISSY: I don't.
HOWARD: You don't?
SISSY: Well, no, I don't reside anywhere in particular. I just keep moving.
HOWARD: A traveler, eh?
SISSY: You might say that, although I don't think of it as traveling.
