Those pursuing/intending to pursue a research career, how did you come to pick your niche?
As someone who has switched fields/interests twice in the last 3 years, and currently struggling to pick a thesis mentor, I'd like to know how/when you guys had the 'this-is-what-I-want-to-spend-my-life-researching' moment? Does that even happen? I get being passionate about quantum mech or aerospace engineering, but how does one go from there to 'quantifying entanglement in higher dimensional space' or 'analyzing the aerodynamics of FishBAC airfoil in low Reynolds regime'?
