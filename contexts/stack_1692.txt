Low current control of triac speed controller? I'm using a cheap Chinese commercial triac speed controller to control a universal motor that pulls considerable amperage (where \"considerable\" is no more than 15 amps at 117 volts).I would like to modify the controller so that it will cut all current to the motor, via a small low current micro switch and associated wiring. I do not know the exact circuit and the device would be difficult to preemptively disassemble. I do have easy access to all three triac terminals, however.It was suggested to me that shorting A1 to G would disable the triac \u2013 it does not.Could I just switch the gate with the micro switch to accomplish what I want?Is significant current flowing through the gate at any time?
