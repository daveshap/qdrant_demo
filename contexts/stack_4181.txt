How would coral reefs thrive on this super-earth world? I have a super-earth world. The surface of the world is shallower due to extra gravity, so shorter mountain ranges and less ocean depths. The world orbits a binary star system at a distance of the furthest region of the habitable zone, both of the stars having masses of 0.93x that of our suns. The world is highly volcanic, approximately 15 to 16 times more volcanic than our planet. The lithosphere is 4x richer in calcium, magnesium and has much more other minerals than present on earth that is very useful for marine life such as boron and strontium. Surface gravity: 1.35x of Earths.Atmosphere thickness: 10x of Earths (a result of it being highly volcanic in comparison to earth.)Atmospheric composition: Nitrogen 78%, 15% Oxygen, 5% Carbon dioxide, 2% Trace gases.Temperature: rather hot, the tropical regions being 90 to 110 degrees Fahrenheit. (based on what I've tested on Universe Sandbox 2)Land coverage: 75% water, and 25% land (but less water being present on this world as the oceans oceans are shallower mostly due to a lot of island formations)Radius: 7750 kilometersDay/Night length/full rotation: 28 hours.Axial tilt: 53 degrees.Orbital period: 1.15 yearsEccentricity: 0.025How could you make it possible for coral reefs to thrive in such a world based on the fact carbon dioxide makes the oceans acidify?
