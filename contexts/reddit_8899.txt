In an article this week, the NYT attributes Trump's popularity to poor voters' belief that the Republican Party has failed to represent their interests. Have the Democrats similarly failed to represent the interests of these voters? Or did they have other reasons for continuing to vote Republican?

The article discusses this only briefly, at two points:
> Most of these [working-class] voters had long since given up on an increasingly liberal and cosmopolitan Democratic Party.

---
> Between 2008 and 2012, according to the Pew Research Center, more lower-income and less-educated white voters shifted their allegiance to Republicans.
These voters had fled the Democratic Party and were angry at Mr. Obama, whom they believed did not have their interests at heart. But not all of them were deeply conservative; many did not think about politics in ideological terms at all. A 2011 Pew survey called them the “Disaffecteds.”

The first point suggests that these voters aligned themselves with the Republicans for social or cultural reasons, while the second implies that the Democratic Party has actually done an even poorer job of representing the interests of poor voters. To what extent are these claims true? Have the Democrats similarly failed to represent the economic interests of these voters? Or did they have other reasons for continuing to vote Republican?
