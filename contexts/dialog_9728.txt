RAYETTE: This certainly is an improvement on the motel an' the coffee shop. How could you have left such a beautiful place, Bobby?
BOBBY: I don't know.
CARL: You've been staying in a motel all this time?
RAYETTE: For two whole weeks, an' there wasn't hardly nobody there to talk to but me. The manager of the place told me it was the off season, an' it must a ben, because other'n me, there was just this 25-year-old kid, DeLyon, that didn't appear to be all there, an' this old married pair next to me that was always hollerin' for quiet. Can you imagine? All you could a heard there was a pin, an' them, hollerin' away...
CARL: I don't understand why you had to stay in a motel. There's more than enough room here.
RAYETTE: Well, I was goin' to, but Bobby said he hadda kind of feel things up here first, which I can understand, but then it went an' took so long, I ran flat outa money... I didn't have no number to call, you know. So I hadda clear outa there an' come on up here, in the hopes that I wouldn't be intrudin' myself...
CARL: Oh, no. You're more than welcome.
RAYETTE: Well, thank you, that's a very nice thing for you to say.
CARL: Not at all.
