Unable to find a job, questions about unemployment
I had been employed for a straight 20 years, since the day I turned 16, until being laid off in January. I worked in IT as a Business Systems Analyst but have been even applying to support positions and I’ve received only 3 calls, all of which never followed up despite them going well. I suspect the reason is that I do not gave a college degree. 

I am a single mom and had to give up my home and move in with my ex when I lost my job. I now only have a week and a half left of unemployment insurance before I am left with nothing. My barebone expenses are about $1700 (storage unit with all of my belongings, doctors appointment, my medications, car payment, etc) and I have no idea what I am going to do if I don’t get a job in a week and a half. I am an only child and neither of my parents can help me out. My credit sucks and my ex is barely staying afloat with the added expenses of me living here. With no extensions, I am literally about to lose everything I own and the medications I need to keep me alive. Even if I was lucky enough to land a retail job working 40 hours a week, I would need double of my state’s minimum wage to cover my expenses? What are my options here? Please help.
