How did Chewbacca get a roast Porg? In Star Wars: The Last Jedi, Chewbacca is seen cooking what is apparently a porg over an open flame. He starts to eat it but then notices several porg watching him with looks of fear. Out of disgust or guilt he decides not to eat the bird. How did he get one to start cooking it in the first place?Did he kill and prepare it himself? This is the implication but seems odd considering the above. If that didn't bother him, why would he have had any problem with eating it?Did one of the natives (the temple guardians) sell it to him, already prepared? Perhaps Luke killed it and gave it to Chewie.Maybe it wasn't a porg, but was some other kind of less intelligent bird?
