DR. JUDD: You're a curious man. You're willing to jeopardize Jacqueline's life in order to satisfy your own curiosity.
GREGORY: You come to me with some wild story about her being in danger - naturally I want to know what kind of danger. I want to know where she is.
GREGORY: It's not just for myself I'm asking. Her sister is here. The kid's half crazy with anxiety.
DR. JUDD: As a man, you distrust me â€”- perhaps you believe me as a physician.
DR. JUDD: Well, then I can tell you that in addition to other dangers, there is a grave danger of Jacqueline losing her sanity. I would advise against you seeing her.
GREGORY: But why? She's been ill --erratic, but I've never heard of anything like that!
