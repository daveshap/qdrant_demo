Complex solutions to the Navier-Stokes equation I had recently ended up with a case where on solving the Laplace equation (for a fluid under certain conditions), the radial dependence turned out to be complex (in general). In such cases, do we work with the real part only? Or should we not neglect the complex part and I am wrong?I can post the exact problem if needed, but this stands as a general question as well. Any hints/tips would be appreciated.
