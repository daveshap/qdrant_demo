WIFE: I told you! I told you, you couldn't trust him! He's gone!
OWNER: Who?
WIFE: That feller last night, that's who! He was gonna stay a week, huh? Well, he's skipped. Took the car with him, too. We wouldn't have known a thing about it until morning if I hadn't took that magnesia. Come on, get up, don't lay there. Let's do something about it.
WIFE: See that. They're gone!
OWNER: Looks like it, don't it? Here's the woman, ma.
WIFE: Oh!!
WIFE: What's the matter? Where's your husband, young lady—
ELLIE: Husband?
WIFE: Yes—if he is your husband.
ELLIE: Isn't he here?
WIFE: No, he ain't! And the car's gone, too.
ELLIE: Why, he'll be back.
WIFE: Yeah? What makes you think so! He took his suitcase and everything. Kinda surprised, huh? It's just like I told you, Zeke. They ain't married a'tall . . .
