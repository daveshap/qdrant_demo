BOB: I warned you, Dignan.
DIGNAN: You said it like it was a big joke, Bob. Like he's wild.
BOB: No, I was saying crazy like a lunatic.
DIGNAN: I know that now. He's a fucking psycho.
BOB: Well, don't blame me. I told you.
DIGNAN: I do blame you, Bob. And woah. Look at her.
DIGNAN: Loop around real fast.
ANTHONY: Just turn right here.
DIGNAN: Where'd she go?
BOB: Maybe she turned.
