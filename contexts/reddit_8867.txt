What actually happened in Nevada, and were any rules actually broken?
There's so much conflicting information that no one seems to have actual evidence or citations for, so I feel this is the only sub that can genuinely answer the question. 

So, [based on the recent events at the Nevada caucus, what the hell happened](http://www.kolotv.com/content/news/Democrats-weigh-in-on-presidential-race-at-Nevada-convention-379528701.html)? 

This is a very hot button issue. Were any actual rules violated? Some footage [for reference of the caucus, in which several allege fraud](https://youtu.be/ZAXYWWfCVDI). 

In the spirit of this sub, I cannot stress enough that I'm really seeking out actual evidence with cited facts if any of you decide to answer. I'm just not restating this because it's a new topic which in turn leads to a lot of banter with more emotion than facts. 

Thank you.
