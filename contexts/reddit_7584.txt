I’m taking my comps on monday. I am so nervous. How did you ace your comps and basically just... how?
Hello fellow grad students. I’m a 28-year old masters student taking up musicology. I’m taking my comps on monday and one subject lasts one whole day. How did you guys study? And how do you manage your anxiety on the day of the test itself?

Please wish me well huhu. Any advice or word of encouragement is highly appreciated. :)
