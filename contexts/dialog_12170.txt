JAKE: Is this all the display space we can get?
MARY: I tried to get more, but this is the limit. The De Vries line has the same area.
JAKE: What do you think of this... ah, shade of blue, Mary.
MARY: I like it, Mr. Van Dorn.
JAKE: Don't you think it's a little too... bright?
MARY: Not really. But if you want me to tone it down...
JAKE: No, no. I wouldn't hire a display designer if I didn't trust her taste. Maybe we should bring in more of that shade. Perhaps a stripe across the back wall.
MARY: No, that would be much too overpowering.
JAKE: Yeah, overpowering. That was the word I was looking for.
MARY: Mr. Van Dorn, I've worked on the color scheme for weeks. I think it's just right.
JAKE: What's that shade of blue called?
MARY: Pavonine. It's the same tint as the stripe in the fabric.
JAKE: Are you still going with that fella that teaches at Grand Valley?
MARY: Sam?
JAKE: Yeah. He's a nice guy. Don't lose him. Maybe we could tone down this stripe a bit. It's a little...
MARY: Overpowering?
JAKE: Yeah.
MARY: Okay, Mr. Van Dorn, I think we could knock that Pavonine blue a bit.
JAKE: Are you sure it's all right?
MARY: Yes. I think it'll look better.
JAKE: If you say so.
MARY: Kristen went on that convention today, didn't she?
JAKE: Yeah. How did you know?
