Probation period tips?
I'm starting a new job and I'm very excited but also VERY nervous! I have a three month probation period and I want to leave my best impression so that this job can be a long-term one. What can I do to pass my probation with flying colours?

Sor far I'm thinking this: show up early, take initiative, remain humble, and be myself.
