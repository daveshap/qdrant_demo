To those who are suffering today
To those who are suffering today, suffered yesterday,  or fear they suffer in the future: you matter.  Your life is important and needed, even when it doesn't seem like it.  You are a beautifully complicated creature with depth and perception that matches that of the deepest ocean.  You are once of the soldiers, strong enough to fight the Good fight. 

You are loved and you matter.
