should I believe my gut, or am I over worrying
My partner and I have been together for almost a year and due to unfortunate personal events have temporarily lived with eachother previously, however has recently moved to a small country town not far from me. I have always been told to trust my instinct and currently it is telling me that she is seeing her ex behind my back. I also have a few reasons to believe this such as her hiding messages from me, refusing to let me see her phone and most of all, messages to eachother talking about hanging out. I have felt this way before but always wrote it off as paranoia and overthinking, however this seems too suspicious. please help, I dont know what to do.
