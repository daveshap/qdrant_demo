I've been unhappy with my job for a while and was looking to leave at this time, but now I feel stuck because of COVID. What are some good ideas to consider moving forward?
I’m sure I’m one of MANY people posting about this same problem, so I’ll first just apologize about this in advance. I’ll also preface this post by saying that I know I’m fortunate to not be out of work right now.

I’ve been pretty unhappy with my job for some time now, and right around this time was when I was planning to look for another one (ironically, I had gone on a trip before COVID-19 broke out and my plan was to do this after I got back home). In summary, here are the reasons why:

* Long hours, understaffing and me agreeing to way too much in the past year has led to me wearing far too many hats. I’m burnt out, never able to complete everything each week and management is aware, but doesn’t seem to do anything about it.
* My role has changed from one where I was supposed to be a creative contributor to my company to one where I just manage and oversee logistics all day. It wasn’t what I signed up to do and I don’t even get to do any of the responsibilities I was originally given when I started (which was work I actually enjoyed, is in line with my skill set and that was valuable for both the company and my resume). Duties that were once mine are now just outsourced by third parties and managed by me. It's definitely not the same thing as what I joined to do, at all.
* Management knows I want to go back to my original duties and have repeatedly told me they will do this for me and reevaluate processes, only to then keep roping me into the very duties (mentioned above) that keep me from doing just that and doing absolutely nothing they promise.
* Management is young, inexperienced and not good at fixing problems when they’re brought to attention. This results in me and other colleagues getting the brunt of other people’s problems.
* According to market trends (at least before COVID), I was being underpaid and overworked for this role. I’m not sure if this still stands now.

Overall, I’ve been unhappy for quite some time now and I don’t feel like this job is at all aligned with my career goals at all. I’ve managed to keep my job and work from home during the pandemic, which makes me feel like an even bigger POS for complaining. But with that being said, I can tell that taking our company online is already starting to worsen the lack of organization and alignment. On top of stress over what’s happening in the world right now, I know my mental health is not in great shape dealing with this role. Even prior to this, I was dealing with working late hours, extreme burnout and lack of sleep. I still want to make the best of my life and my career during this time and I know I’m not doing it here.

With all this being said, I am perfectly happy with working from home (I'm a bit of an introvert and actually fare really well with it) and the type of work I do is very easy to do remotely. Is it worth the risk to still look for something else right now or am I making a bad move? I’d love to know if anyone else has greater insight on the remote market right now or what that’s looking like. It's been over a year since I've looked for a job and I've never looked for a wholly remote opportunity before.
