The fear isn’t in dying. My fear is failing to commit suicide and the pain that I’ll feel as I try.
If I had a gun it would be easier, but my only options  all require pain. I just have to get past the pain part and I’ll be good to go.

Edit: I really don’t care for what comes after I die.  I just know that it’s better than dealing with what’s here for me. Trust me, I’ve tried my best to keep moving forward in this world, but it’s all been pointless. I have no fear of being dead; I just struggle with the natural human instinct of fearing/avoiding pain. If there’s one thing in this life that I’m sure of, it’s that I want to die and it’s not a fleeting thought. I think about it the majority of every day.

The fact that so many individuals in the comments feel similarly is heartbreaking. Some of us are not fortunate or strong enough to go on living. Some of us have been beat down by life one too many times. I wish that was not the case, but unfortunately it is. It’s really saddening to see. But I sympathize because I feel the same.
