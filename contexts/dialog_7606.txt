EDDIE: So how was school today?
DONNIE: It was great. We had peanut-butter sandwiches and apples and honey at snacktime. And then during show-and- tell, my stuffed walrus was a big hit.
EDDIE: Good Lord. So the construction guys say it'll take about a week to fix the roof. Damn airline better not fuck us on the shingle match.
DONNIE: Do they know yet?
EDDIE: Know what?
DONNIE: Where it came from?
EDDIE: No... apparently they can't tell us what happened yet. Something about a matching serial number that got burned. But I had to sign a form saying I wouldn't talk to anyone about it.
DONNIE: So we're not supposed to tell anybody what nobody knows?
EDDIE: You tell Dr. Thurman whatever you want.
EDDIE: Oh, shit!
DONNIE: Grandma Death.
