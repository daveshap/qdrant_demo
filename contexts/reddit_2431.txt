Lost in job hunt and life, what the hell do I do now?
I’m 35, have a degree in wildlife management. After college spent 4 years running trucks for UPS to put my wife through law school. All the while applying for my dream job. I’ve now been working retail for 7 years and taking care of my two kids while the wife has a successful law career. 

Have applied to my dream job at every chance, and every time, at the last selection process, I’ve been denied with no explanation. I decided that my family was too important for me to keep wasting time. Wanted to stay home and take care of my kids so my wife can pursue her career to the fullest.

She decided to leave me for her boss cause she doesn’t respect me. I’ve never been lower and I’ve never been so lost. I now have to find an actual career, not just a job. 

I’ve looked and applied to every job/career that I can think of that would be appropriate for my degree. I love the outdoors and I love working with wildlife. I have begun looking into getting my pilots license, but that will take a lot of money I don’t really have and a long time to make any money. 

I have to find something to sustain myself and my kids. Big city, small house, small vehicle, all the bills, and no prospects.......
