36 Questions Designed To Help You Fall In Love With Anyone
The New York Times lists 36 questions you can ask someone if you want to fall in love. (Or make your love even stronger). Even if they don't fall in love, these would make great conversation starters. So grab some wine, sit down with someone you want to love or get to know!

EDIT: This came from a study titled "The Experimental Generation of Interpersonal Closeness: A Procedure and Some Preliminary Findings" by Aron et al. The study never once claims that it can get someone to fall in love. Rather it offers a "practical methodology for creating closeness in an experimental context."
