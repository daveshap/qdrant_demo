I think I may have depression.
Historically speaking, I've been a happy, easy going, hard working person, and thus far things have gone pretty well in my life.  Lately, I am just having real trouble getting motivated and focused enough to do anything, even things I enjoy.  It's getting harder and harder to do everything.  I know what needs to be done and I know I can do it, I just can't get there.  Even taking the dog for a walk feels like a real chore.  It's really frustrating.

Worse than that, I find myself getting very irritable over absolutely everything.  I'm snapping at people and just being a miserable sh\*t, even over something as small as somebody coming into my office to say hi.  I know in the moment that my behavior is irrational, but I just can't stop myself.  It's like I'm standing 3' back watching myself be an a\*\*hole.

I know that I'm not feeling or acting like myself.  I try to push myself through but it's just getting harder and harder to do.  But I have to do something, I'm afraid that things are just going to start falling apart if I don't.  I know there are options but I'm not sure where to start.

Anyway, I'm not sure what I'm expecting by posting this here.  I haven't shared this with anybody and I just had to get it out somewhere.

Update: This post is probably the first time I've ever articulated how I felt.  I can't express how good it felt just to put it into words.  I've made an appointment with my doctor.  I'm not sure what's going to happen but for the first time in a long time I'm feeling hopeful.  Thanks all for listening.
