Is my model a good fit? I am being tortured with the following problem...I have a set of crude mortality rates for ages 0 to 60. Let's call them Observed Rates.I use a smoothing technique (cubic spline regression) on the crude mortality rates and so smoothed mortality rates are produced for ages 0 to 60. Let's call them Estimated Rates.I want to know whether the Estimated Rates are a good representation of the Observed Rates. I have calculated the R-square, however I am also looking to confirm this with a statistical test.Could wilcoxon signed rank test work for my case?
