I'm struggling to wake up in the morning.
Before I go on, I should say I'm on anti-depressants, and do not experience any feelings of depression anymore, but for whatever reason getting out of bed is impossible. I've been late to university every day the past two weeks, and I've skipped classes because I've been too tired to get out of bed. 
How do I fix this?
