MAX: Across the street a Great Western. It goes in a trust account. You'll need to fill out an Application for Appearance Bond, an Indemnity Agreement, a Contingent Promissory Note. That's the one, if Beaumont skips and I go after him, you pay the expenses.
ORDELL: Beaumont ain't going nowhere. Where do I sign?
ORDELL: Hey, Max.
MAX: Yes.
ORDELL: I was wondering. What if before the court date gets here, Beaumont gets hit by a bus or something and dies. I get my money back, don't I?
