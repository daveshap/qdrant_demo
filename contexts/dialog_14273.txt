ORDELL: Louis, my man. Watcha doin'?
LOUIS: Oh, I dunno. Watching TV.
ORDELL: Whatcha watchin'?
LOUIS: Nothin' really. Just kinda goin' back and forth. They had some black girl from some black show on Jay Leno. I watched that for a bit, but I kept flippin channels cause I didn't know who she was.
ORDELL: Guess where I am?
LOUIS: I dunno.
ORDELL: I know you don't know. I said guess.
LOUIS: The moon -- I dunno
ORDELL: I'm talkin' to you from the comfy- cozy interior of an Oldsmobile parked outside your nasty-ass welfare motel.
LOUIS: You're outside?
ORDELL: Uh-huh.
LOUIS: C'mon in.
ORDELL: Naw, man. I just told you, I'm comfortable. I ain't about to walk into that roach motel and get uncomfortable. You bring your ass out here.
LOUIS: I'm in my underwear.
ORDELL: Then put your goddam drawers on, and get your ass out here. I got somethin' to show you.
