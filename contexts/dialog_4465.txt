BOB: Dignan and Anthony, this is Little Richard. He's crazy. Totally nuts.
LITTLE RICHARD: I don't know about that.
BOB: Little Richard. Trust me. You're insane. Jesus, this guy used to carry a percussion bomb around in his trunk. You do not want a guy like that loose on the streets.
LITTLE RICHARD: It seemed like a good idea at the time.
BOB: The one and only Little Richard.
