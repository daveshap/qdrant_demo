Adjust thresholds in multi-class classification I have trained a random forest classifier on a (highly-imbalanced) 3-class problem (A 1% of the data, B 96%, C 3%) and obtained probabilities for each of the three classes. Currently I assign an observation to the class with the highest probability.Is there a possibility to adjust the thresholds so I can make a statement like \"With maximal 1% probability we will be predicting B though it is actually A\"? How can this be done? I really need to control for this type of error while other errors are not that important.
