Chi-squared testing for say TWO samples from TWO distributions Chi-squared test can be used to check the hypothesis, that given sampleis from the given theoretical distribution.Assume as I have two samples (x1, ... xn) , (y1, ... ym) ,and two theoretical distributions F1, F2 I want somehow to check the hypothesis that X is from F1 and Y from F2.Question: Is there some modifications of chi-squred test to that situation of two samples and two distributions ? Of course, we can do two tests, but the question is how to combine the results ? For example the first test gives \"YES\the second \"NO\". That it is why I want something like a joint test.
