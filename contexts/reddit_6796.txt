Question about Independent Recruiting
I'm out of work right now and job hunting for the first time in a really long time.  I get a lot of contact from independent/third-party recruiters, i.e. headhunters.  They contact me with a position they're trying to fill.  In most cases, we have a good, or even great conversation.  Then comes the brick wall, i.e. "let me talk to my account manager".  After that, I do not hear back.  I've spoken to upwards of 100 of these headhunters over the last few months.  I'm wondering why the conversation goes so good with the headhunter but the account manager feels so differently?  Or is the recruiter just BS'ing me?  It might be worth mentioning that I have 27 years of experience but I've said I can come down into their salary ranges.  I'd love to know why I never hear back.  Perhaps someone knows how these independent recruiting companies work; I don't.  Thanks!
