I want to kill myself to avoid the future
Generally speaking, my life isn’t terrible right now. But I know the future is going to be unimaginably painful and it scares the crap out of me. So much so that I’m willing to end it all to avoid it. 

Maybe I’m just overreacting, since what I’m scared of is what pretty much everyone goes through. But I really don’t want responsibility. I hate that the more I age, the more people expect of me. I don’t want to turn 18 and suddenly be an adult, thrown out to the world. There’s so much that will have to be done in my life and I can’t handle it. 

Getting into university, getting a job, a drivers licence, hell even just the idea of having to get groceries... it all scares me. I feel like everything is happening too fast. 

I hate that this problem isn’t something I can just fix. It will never “get better” because what troubles me is life itself. How am I supposed to fix the fact that I’m too anxious to live?
