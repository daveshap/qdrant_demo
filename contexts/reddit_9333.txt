My emergency fund saved me the last 6 months!
It’s true, y’all. Emergency funds are no joke. I lost my job in April & just got hired this past week for a new position at a better company. I’ll be making more money & have amazing benefits. 

I can not stress the importance of having even a few months saved away as it can quite literally help you find a better job by taking the time you need to focus on something you want. This will be nice because you won’t have to throw yourself into something you wouldn’t like to do.

I’m not blind to the fact I was in an incredible position to sit around & wait a couple more months than I wanted to in order to land this job but I urge everyone to save as much as possible in case this ever happens to them. During the months off I had car repairs, random medical bills (albeit small) and many other unforeseen issues arise. 

Just happy to report I didn’t miss any bill payments & I finally have a dream job & I still have some money left over just incase!
