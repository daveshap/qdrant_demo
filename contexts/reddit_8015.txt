Spending money to attend a conference
What are your thoughts on attending a conference that I have to spend a good chunk of my own money to attend (likely ~$600-700)? Our department provides $500 to first year grad students to attend a conference without needing to present a poster, but this particular conference is really expensive because it’s held at a retreat center (which also means lodging and meals are included for the 3 day conference).

Thoughts? 

It does sound both personally and professionally enjoyable- the schedule includes time for a hike and an evening fire under the stars :) Also my advisor will be there and it’s a pretty small conference (~130 people) so I could meet a lot of relevant people in the field. 

It takes place in early-mid November, so I have not found any options for additional funding with that short of a turnaround time :(
