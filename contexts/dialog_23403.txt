MARY: Yes.
MRS. REDI: This is Mrs. Redi, Mary.
MARY: I'll be out in a minute.
MRS. REDI: That won't be necessary. I haven't much to say.
MRS. REDI: If I were you, Mary -- I'd go back to school. I'd make no further attempt to find Jacqueline.
MARY: Why?
MRS. REDI: It will make you unhappy to find Jacqueline. It would put her in danger --- great danger --
MRS. REDI: I can almost feel your doubt about what I'm saying, Mary.
MARY: I can't give up looking for her, Mrs. Redi, no matter what you're hinting at.
MRS. REDI: I have no intention whatsoever of hinting. Your sister, Mary, is a murderess. She killed Irving August -- stabbed him out of fright when he discovered where she was hiding.
MARY: I don't believe it.
MRS. REDI: I had to help get rid of the body. You saw it on the subway. And I warn you, Mary -- go back -- you don't know what you're doing, or what dreadful things you might bring about by looking for your sister. You go back to school - - go back and forget Jacqueline.
MRS. REDI: I'm sorry to be late, Natalie.
MRS. CORTEZ: We haven't even begun tea yet.
