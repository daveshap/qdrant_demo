Suggestion for Sub Improvement - move pay offs to a sticky thread
This sub is going downhill. We need to get this back to helping people, not humble brags about paying off a $1k loan. Good job, but do we need 50 threads a day about that?  No. 

Suggestion: none of these posts daily. Let's move to a sticky thread? The screen shots don't add much to the conversation - they are unneeded. Let's get back to helping others.
