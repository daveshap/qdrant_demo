BABY: The door's locked. I'll gotta go around... wait here.
BILL: OK.
BILL: Christ, you scared the shit out of me.
BABY: Aw, you ain't seen nothing yet.
BILL: Is your brother ready to go?
BABY: Oh... yeah, he already left. We'll wait inside, come on.
BILL: He left!
BABY: Yeah, come on.
MARY: How long has it been?
DENISE: I don't know... about half an hour.
MARY: What was that?
DENISE: What? I didn't hear anything.
MARY: Wait... quiet. Turn off the radio.
