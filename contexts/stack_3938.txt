How do you test if three means significantly differ from each other using an F test? I know the means, sample sizes, and standard deviations of three samples drawn independently from three populations.  I need to test whether they differ significantly from each other using an $F$ statistic.  However, I've looked at a few Stats books and can't find a procedure to do this.  I'm familiar with simple ANOVAs and with testing for the difference of two  means, if that helps to understand what sorts of things I already understand.
