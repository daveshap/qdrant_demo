JULIE: Do you remember who gave us this?
PHIL: No.
JULIE: There's no card or anything.
JULIE: I hear things in this house,
PHIL: All new houses have noises.
JULIE: How long does it have to be a new house?
PHIL: One day before we know it it'll be an old house and we'll be old in it -- and I'll still be paying for it.
JULIE: Neil's still having a bad time at school. I feel terrible seeing him so upset all the time.
PHIL: He's made some friends, hasn't he?
PHIL: I mean, he's a smart kid, he'll get by -- he takes after me. You're too sensitive.
JULIE: I know someone else who's sensitive.
