advice on email applying for a job
i’m applying for a part time job and the company said they’re always keen to hear from people and to email if you’re interested. i’ve never applied for a job before, this will be my first time and i’m unsure on whether my email is suitable or not? if anyone has any advice on what to include or what not to include it would be very appreciated. this is what i have at the moment, (i have replaced all personal information).

Hello,

I am currently a year 12 student at (school) looking for a part time employment as to gain a variety of skills, independence and experience. I’m a highly motivated and enthusiastic student, and I believe I would thoroughly enjoy working in a lively and friendly environment such as yours. If you have any part time jobs available in the (city) region, I would be more than willing to attach my cv or arrange a time to talk with you. I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,
