Thank You to the guys who do this while dating. [gratitude list]
I've been pretty negative as of late, but I wanted to write a post on all the great things that guys are doing while dating.

1.) I really love it when you set up a date and then tell me you have somewhere to be in a couple hours. This way, I'm free to have fun without feeling like if I smile too much, I'm inadvertently inviting you back to my place or obligated to have sex. (I know I don't have to, but this just makes it so much more comfortable)

2.) Thank you for complimenting me on something other than my looks. It sounds really vain, but if you're a little bit pretty, that's all guys tell you. It sometimes feels like the rest of me doesn't matter. But when guys tell me I'm funny or a great conversationalist, I feel like they really like Me (and not a temporary thing that makes me lucky).

3.) Thank you for asking questions. I so appreciate someone who is interested in me and not just what I can do for them. I always notice even if I don't say much.

4.) Thank you for not giving me all the power. I love it when guys are confident enough to argue a little bit. I don't want to feel as if you think I could break over the slightest 'no'. I like a little bit of teasing. It makes me feel more equal.

5.) Thank you for meeting me at a place that's accessible to both of us. I love being able to rely on myself and this is just one of those nice little things that men sometimes do to make me feel more comfortable.

Dating can be really tough and it's easy to get down by the whole process. I truly am appreciative of the efforts. Even if I don't say them out loud, I think about them and I remember them. (and I write them down here)
