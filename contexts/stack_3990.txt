Between-subject fMRI classification: subjects with different number of runs The main purpose of my work is to discriminate patients vs healthy controls using fMRI and multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA). Since I want to classify at the subject level I performed a separate subject GLM in order to get the parameter estimates for each task condition. Then I transformed beta estimates into t values in order to improve signal to noise ratio. I have 31 controls and 32 patients. All of them completed 3 runs except for 4 patients that only completed 2 runs due to fatigue. My question is: since MVPA is very sensitive to uneven classes should I exclude the 4 patients that only completed 2 runs and then balance classes by doing some kind of undersampling of the controls class for instance? My main concern is that those 4 patients have lower signal to noise ratio when compared to the others that completed 3 runs which could undermine classification accuracy.I searched through several papers and some textbooks but I cant find anything on uneven runs in between-subject classification analysis. I would appreciate it if someone shared some references about this topic.
