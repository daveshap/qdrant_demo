JORDAN: Do we know it's him using the beacon? Not a decoy?
ROYCE: Signals received only sparingly, in such a pattern that leads us to conclude it is a downed aviator trying to conserve his batteries.
JORDAN: Chances of recovery?
ROYCE: You're the analyst for East China, O'Neil. Analyze.
JORDAN: North Korean beaches are the best protected, most heavily monitored in the world. The civilian population is so propagandized that it acts as an Early Warning system. Extraction team has to be small and silent -- I'd go with Seals over Delta Force. Problem is, don't want to hold a conventional sub off-shore for target practice. Where's The Polk?
ROYCE: Halfway 'round the world. So that's the problem -- we can get the team in, just not out.
JORDAN: Unless you Whiskey Run.
ROYCE: Blank faces here, O'Neil.
JORDAN: Quick-hit technique used by Capone. Rigged a getaway car with running boards and handles. All his guys had to do was jump on and take a ride. Check the files -- DPRK-57 -- I doped it out as a contingency plan: Seal Team infiltrates, picks up the package, links up with recovery sub. But don't waste time opening and closing hatches. They just grab the periscope and hang on for neutral waters.
ROYCE: You expect the extraction team to ride the sub bare-back? Is that correct, O'Neil?
JORDAN: Only four minutes to neutral waters, sir. Why not?
