How to dress for a drug test?
It's at an agency for a factory job packing dog food (yeah it's lame but the pay is decent). It's super hot out so shorts are really tempting but even I can see that that's not a great idea. I've never done a drug test and I'm really nervous, anxiety is getting the best of me. All my shoes are pretty worn down too.
