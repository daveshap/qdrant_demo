r/jobnetworking has been created!
I was surprised to find that this sub-reddit didn't exist and thought it would be a great way to take advantage of a great community. This will be a place for networking tips, events and one-on-one connections. To make this work, we need employed people and well as unemployed people. Please share this subreddit to anyone you think would find it useful!
If you're employed, let us know your field and if you're comfortable, where you work. If you're looking for a connections somewhere in particular or in a specific field, post that too!
