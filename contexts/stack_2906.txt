Direction of Coriolis force My doubt is all about finding the direction of coriolis force by using the direction of the moving object. I really find it difficult to determine the direction of coriolis force through direction of moving object. Because, the direction of the moving object is given in the form of degree and that too in a confusing way. For instance, an object is moving at 60\u00b0N latitude/colatitude. Here direction of the moving object is given in the form of latitude which is very confusing to me and just because of that I don't know how to find the direction of coriolis force?
