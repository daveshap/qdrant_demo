Anything. I just need something to get me to the end of this 10+ hour shift.
All week I have been depressed at some point. For a while I was able to take this meaningless life of never ending work, but after 2 months of my boss working as many 12 hour days as he could to pay for his weeding, I can't keep my depression aways anymore. 

Please some kind of help, something. I know that nothing is free, but I just need something beyond promises of hope or things will get better.

Edit: I'm finally home after popping a tire in a pothole (was outside the office and able to use the tools there) and got something to eat. I don't really feel any better, but at least I'm off work for 2 days. I can't hide the thread, but I'm not really in the mood to talk about my hopeless life.
