Question about first job ever/first retail job?
I just start my first job last week and Since it’s near the holidays I’ve been working 8+ hours every shift. My feet and legs are in pain still right now after a good nights rest and I have to get back at 6;00 pm today. What can help reduce the pain when I get back from work everyday? Also what can help reduce the pain during work like what shoes/techniques and tips do you guys recommend? Thanks!
