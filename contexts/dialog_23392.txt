GREGORY: Well?
JASON: This is the part of New York I love. It is old. It has memories. If you listen, the houses will speak to you. Walt Whitman...Edna St. Vincent Millay... Eugene O'Neill...in their time they've all lived here.
GREGORY: All very nice but, what are you going to do - listen at every house in New York for Jacqueline's voice?
JASON: I'm looking for a party -- a merry party.
GREGORY: Well, that's illuminating.
