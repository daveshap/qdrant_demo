Hiring Managers or employers answer me this: How often do you have a candidate that matches ALL the qualifications listed in the ad?
I see all these job listings that I think I might be good for but I get discouraged if a see a qualification listed that I don’t have. Even if it says “preferred” and not “required” I still think that someone out there that has all these qualifications will apply and they will get picked over me so why bother. And I don’t apply. So I’m wondering, in your experience, how common is it to have a candidate that actually matches all requirements?
