I'm 22 years old. I was happy for two years and really thought I was safe. It turns out, my best friend and the only person I ever trusted has been lying and cheating on me for two years. 

I'll never be good enough. The pain will never stop. I'll always be used. I attract pain. I'm too soft, to ready to be hurt. I'm small and the world is so sharp. 

I'm so tired of hurting. I have a plan. I'm waiting 24 hours.
