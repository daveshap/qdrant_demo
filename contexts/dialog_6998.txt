FRIDA: Peter knows something.
JENNIFER: Well if he does, he didn't give you away. He must really like you.
PETER: Spencer's the key here. Frida is in no way associated with him. And her blood hasn't matched with any of the killings.
LLOYD: It's a bit farfetched that Mark would rip guys to shreds just outta jealousy. This makes no sense.
PETER: It's like some fucking monster dropped out of the sky and killed these dudes.
LLOYD: Like a vampire or some shit?
