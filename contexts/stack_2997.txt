Is the spin in quantum entanglement set at the moment the particles are separated, instead of when measured? Is the spin in quantum entanglement set the moment the particles are separated,  instead of transmitted instantaneously to its twin particle at the time of measurement? Wouldn't this make more sense then particles transmitting information instantly across a large distance faster than the speed of light? Couldn't the superposition collapse at the time of separation leaving both particles frozen with the same spin, momentum, polarization, ect no matter where they are taken or what happens to them?  Could this tie in with \"Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete' ?A. Einstein, B. Podolsky AND N. Rosen, Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, New Jersey(Received March 25, 1935) \".I very well could be something I'm missing, I don't have a degree in Quantum Physics, yet, and I'm only a Senior in High School, but Quantum Physics is something that I am very interested in. I have had this question for a few years now, and have not found anything on the subject. Now I am writing a research paper on the subject for an English class, but I can't find anything directly mentioning my question. One fault in my research could be the fact that I do not understand much of the math, due to my level being Calculus, but I would really like this answered. It would be great if I could get a link to the research or proof against or for my argument.
