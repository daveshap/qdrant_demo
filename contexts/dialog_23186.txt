GALE: Nobody said she was an actor.
JENNIFER: Good twist.
MILTON: What's your point?
DEWEY: No point, I'm just gonna give Detective Kincaid a call.
MILTON: I remember her! She was a bit player in a couple of my movies. A nobody! So what does it matter?
JENNIFER: Oh, Come on! You have made millions off the story of her murder. You're obsessed with HER and you're obsessed with her DAUGHTER!
GALE: Settle down Beavis. Why don't you tell us the truth?
MILTON: What the hell are you guys getting at? I make horror films, that's what I do. The Studio came to me with 'Stab'. They came to me, check it out.
DEWEY: But you know who she was.
MILTON: When we did the first 'Stab I realized I'd known Maureen Prescott before
GALE: And now? I mean, murders on your set and still you say nothing?
MILTON: Get real, that would make me a suspect!
GALE: Just because you knew her?
MILTON: Yeah.
GALE: I don't think so! Just what happened to Maureen when she was in Hollywood?
MILTON: Now you listen to me, Lois Lane, let it go. It's dead and buried. Daddy took ol' Yeller out behind the barn and shot him in the head a long time ago.
GALE: Well how would you like his rotten carcass dug up and drug all over National TV? Why don't you start talking.
MILTON: It was in the 70's, everything was different. I was well known for my parties, Rina knew what they were. It was for girls like her to meet men, men who could get them parts, if they made the right impression. Nothing happened to her that she didn't invite, in one way or another, no matter what she said afterwards.
GALE: Are you saying she was-
MILTON: I'm saying things got out of hand. Maybe they did take advantage of her!. Maybe the sad truth is, this is not the city for innocence. No charges were brought. And the bottom line is, Rina Reynolds wouldn't play by the rules. You wanna get ahead in Hollywood, you gotta play the game, or go home.
SIDNEY: What do you know about trilogies?
DETECTIVE KINCAID: You mean like, movie trilogies?
SIDNEY: You seem to like movies, Detective.
DETECTIVE KINCAID: Call me Mark, would you? Cause I'm gonna keep calling you Sidney.
SIDNEY: I'll call you Mark when you catch the killer, Detective.
DETECTIVE KINCAID: All I know about movie trilogies is in the third one, all bets are off.
SIDNEY: Did you request this case?
DETECTIVE KINCAID: No, they tend to put me on the ones that deal with the business. I grew up here, and I know my way around the studios.
SIDNEY: Must be exciting, Beautiful place, beautiful people.
DETECTIVE KINCAID: To me Hollywood is about death.
SIDNEY: Excuse me?
DETECTIVE KINCAID: I'm a homicide detective, remember? When you see what I see day in and day out, the violence that people do to each other, you get haunted. I think you know about that.
SIDNEY: What do you mean?
DETECTIVE KINCAID: I know what it's like to see ghosts that don't Go away. To be watching a scary movie in your head, whether you want to or not, watching it alone.
SIDNEY: Ghosts are tough, you can't shoot ghosts.
DETECTIVE KINCAID: Can't arrest ghosts. But the best way to stop being haunted is to be with people. You're here, you're not hiding, you've done the right thing, Miss Prescott.
SIDNEY: Hmm.
DETECTIVE KINCAID: What did you know about your mother?
SIDNEY: I used to think I had the perfect mom, perfect family. Till I found out I was wrong. She had a secret life, and I tried to understand that, and soon as I thought I had, more secrets. I don't' know who my mom was. Sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about my mother for the first time. You know, with TV and those movies and what not. God sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about myself for the first time. Like I'm watching my life instead of living in it.
DETECTIVE KINCAID: Here's the deal, I'm off to search the soundstage. That's good news.
SIDNEY: How is that good news?
DETECTIVE KINCAID: Because, that means that we're dealing with an ordinary, flesh and blood killer. And I know how to handle guys like that.
SIDNEY: Oh yeah, how?
DETECTIVE KINCAID: Catch him, or kill him.
