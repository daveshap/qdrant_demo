KIDELL: Would you like more tea?
BRENNA: No thank you, I'm fine.
KIDELL: He was unsual.
BRENNA: Why?
KIDELL: Well, this is a small town, and it was even smaller then. Most all the babies I delivered were from local families. Richard's parents were just passing through when his mother's time came. I did it right here at the house.
BRENNA: Then you didn't know Richard later on.
KIDELL: No.
BRENNA: I've been trying to find somebody who knew him and any connections his family might have had with museums or historical societies.
KIDELL: Don't know about any of that. Suppose nobody does.
BRENNA: I don't follow you.
KIDELL: Poor little tyke didn't have a chance. Hopelessly premature. He died a few days after he was born.
BRENNA: The boy _died_?
KIDELL: Mother too. Sad case it was. The young lady just couldn't make it through labor. Never even saw her son.
