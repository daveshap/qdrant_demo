This shit is so terrifying
I cant stop crying 

I just want to calm down but i cant

I fucking cant 

Im afraid all the time and i cant stop 

Every thought is like an explosion in my brain 

It's like the world is trying to devour me

I just want this to stop but it always comes back, always 

I know its such self pitying bullshit but I cannot convince myself that anyone really likes me, no matter what they say, being alive is just so tiring 

I treat EVERYTHING like a freaking personal attack 
I twist every postive, kind thing the people in my life do for me and turn it into something absolutely unrecognizable

Its disgusting

I cannot make a right decision 

Posting this is wrong 

But I dont know what else to do?

But its wrong 

Writing this out has kind of been therapeutic so there's that? 

Its either I write this freakout to reddit because all other social media is terrifying rn (and people i know inhabit those, ew) or I keep scrolling through the apps on my phone endlessly while I hyperventilate 

I shall add another sad voice to the void, enjoy.
Thank you for reading.
Any helpful tips to deal would be appreciated.
I hope you all are not feeling as panicky as I am :')

Edit: seriously so thankful you all have been leaving so many nice comments :') (and even gave me a gold?? Thank you!) I may not respond to everyone but I am surely reading every comment and am beyond appreciative!
