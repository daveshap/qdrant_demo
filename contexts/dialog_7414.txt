BETH: Ann Arbor isn't... that far from Cleveland, right?
JAM: Nah. Once I get my own wheels, I could come up all the time.
BETH: That'd be great. Hey, maybe someday your band'll play there. It's a college town, you know?
JAM: I feel like such an idiot. Why didn't I just say something a year and a half ago? Man, think of how much time we wasted.
BETH: Let's not think about the past. Let's just think about from today on. I'll never forget you, Jam.
JAM: Tell me about it. Church will never be the same again.
BETH: Coming dad. I'll call you. Soon as we get a phone. Bye.
JAM: Bye.
HAWK: Amanda, as ironic as this is gonna sound, I can't take any money for... I'm no Midnight Cowboy, y'know. It would only cheapen the whole deal for me.
AMANDA: I'm not paying you for the lovemaking, Hawk. I just want you to have whatever you needed the money for when you took me up on my offer.
