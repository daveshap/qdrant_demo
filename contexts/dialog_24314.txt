TOMMY: Okay, joke about it. I don't give a shit.
JERRY: Jesus, Tommy, it ain't science, you know. You got your good trades and your bad trades. That's how it works.
TOMMY: They didn't have to do a thing, that's all I'm saying. The team was good, the best fucking team in baseball. But then they had to screw it up. They traded their birthright for a mess of porridge. A mess of porridge.
AUGGIE: How'd you do out there, Jimmy?
JIMMY: Good, Auggie. Real good. All finished.
AUGGIE: It'll never be finished.
JIMMY: Huh?
AUGGIE: That's how it is with sidewalks. People come, people go, and they all drop shit on the ground. As soon as you clean up one spot and move on to the next, the first spot is dirty again.
JIMMY: I just do what you tell me, Auggie. You tell me to sweep, so I sweep.
JERRY: Hey, Jimmy. You got the time?
JIMMY: Huh?
JERRY: You still have that watch Auggie gave you?
JIMMY: Tick-tock, tick-tock.
JERRY: So what's the time?
JIMMY: Twelve-eleven. Twelve-twelve. Twelve-twelve.
