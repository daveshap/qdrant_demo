ESCOBAR: You're behind the times, Jake. They've got steam irons now. And I'm out of Chinatown.
GITTES: Since when?
ESCOBAR: Since I made Lieutenant.
GITTES: Congratulations.
ESCOBAR: Uh-huh. So what are you doing here?
GITTES: Looking for someone.
ESCOBAR: Who?
GITTES: Hollis Mulwray. You seen him?
ESCOBAR: Oh yes.
GITTES: I'd like to talk to him.
ESCOBAR: You're welcome to try. There he is.
ESCOBAR: It looks like he was washed the entire length of the runoff channel. Could he swim?
EVELYN: Of course.
ESCOBAR: Obviously the fall must have knocked him out.
