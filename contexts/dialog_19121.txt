MARY: Hello.
TRIPLETTE: Glad to meet you.
BILL: You want anything? A drink?
TRIPLETTE: Oh, no, listen, I don't want to take up too much of your time.
BILL: Don't you worry. We're just having a quiet Sunday at home.
TRIPLETTE: Well, I'm here putting together a show. It's a benefit really.
BILL: Whose?
TRIPLETTE: Hal Phillip Walker.
MARY: Oh, no.
TRIPLETTE: He's pretty well known down here.
