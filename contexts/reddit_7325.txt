I physically entered a retail to offer my CV. Now I have been there for a week still with no contract.
For the first time in my life (20 y/o male) I physically went searching for a job. I’ve been unemployed after a miserable job this February. 

I found a mobile repair shop which told me to call the boss. He immediately said I could go to the shop the next day to receive training so I did, spending a good 6 hours with the only guy in charge of the shop, who showed me an introduction to mobile repairing.

Now I’ve stayed there for a week (minus the weekend) and nothing is written, no contract, not even a promise of money. I understand I don’t have a claim for it, but why should I get treated like this when I physically show initiative and hard work?

I’ve actually been working solidly. The guy running the shop hardly speaks our native language while I do, so I’ve basically been handling this shop’s customer service for a full week without any thanks.

Today he told me that if I want this job, I will have to go to our capital Oslo an hour away from where I live to go to a related store in order to receive training within mobile repairing. He made no note of salary during this time, nor if I would be guaranteed a contract if I did this training.

They say they desperately need people because the current guy working locally which I’ve been working with will leave for the 1st of April. Therefore making it even stupider that they would treat me like this.

If the skill required to fix mobile phones is so important and difficult as they seem to claim, surely they wouldn’t have gave me the chance when I specified I had no experience in the matter, right?
