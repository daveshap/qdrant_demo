I did it, r/Anxiety! I went to the movie theater by myself!
I have been wanting to see The Secret Life of Pets ever since I saw the first trailer, but I couldn't find anybody who wanted to go with me. 

After a week of mustering up the courage to go by myself, I finally drove to the theater tonight. My hands were shaking as I used the touchscreen to buy my ticket from the automated ticket dispenser, but after a deep breath, I managed to click "confirm". 

I actually came at a pretty bad time, because the theater was absolutely packed with kids and parents. As a 22 year old male, I stuck out like a sore thumb. Thankfully, the lights were low when I walked in, so nobody even gave me a second glance. 

Get this! Since most of the seats were taken, I had to take a seat at the very front! I was extremely self conscious for the first 5 minutes, as I imagined everyone staring at the weirdo without kids who came by himself. As the first trailers started to play, I calmed down a lot, and from then on, it was easy to relax and enjoy the movie. I even laughed along with the rest of the audience during the movie's funny moments.

I am so proud of myself today. I didn't get any rude or mean comments from anybody, and I saw a movie that I've been wanting to see for awhile. This day was completely awesome :)
