Single word for for \"beyond their years\" Is there a word that indicates somebody has an innate sense of something exceeding the expected grasp of that sense for his age? Similar to wise beyond their years.An example case would be a ~18 year-old teenager that is as mature and responsible as an average 35 year-old adult. <blockquote>  The death of his parents early in life had instilled in John an X sense of responsibility for his younger siblings.</blockquote>I keep thinking of \"preternatural\but I feel like it's too broad. You could use it for things that are too big, too fast, or just plain unusual. I'm looking for something that deals specifically with time.
