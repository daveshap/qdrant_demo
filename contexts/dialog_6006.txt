ALFREDO: How's school?
SALVATORE: OK. OK. But now that I've got a job, I'11 probably stop going...
ALFREDO: Don't do that...Sooner or later you'll be left empty-handed.
SALVATORE: Why? What do you mean?
ALFREDO: Toto, this isn't for you. For the moment, the Cinema Paradiso needs you, and you need the Cinema Paradiso. But it won't last...Some day you'll have other things to do, more important things... That's right, more important. I know it. Now that I've lost my sight I see more. I see everything I didn't see before... And it's all thanks to you, who saved my life. And I'll never forget it... And don't put on that look. I haven't gone off my head yet. You want proof?
SALVATORE: Yes. I want proof.
ALFREDO: For example, at this moment the film's out of focus. Go see.
