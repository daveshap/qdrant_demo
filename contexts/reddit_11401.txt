Sick of not having anyone to talk to
I know my problems are probably a 1 out of 10 on the scale of significance compared to others, but I don't know anything else.

What bothers me most right now is that I can't even talk to it with anyone.  I've already discussed some of this stuff with my parents, and have visited a physician about depression and anxiety.  However, aside from my parents there is only one friend I talk with regularly, and he doesn't give a shit about this kind of stuff.  Or if he does, he will only reply with one sentence, so it gives the impression that he doesn't.  

I've spent a fair share of time trying to seek some kind of help or something on reddit and /r9k/ on 4chan, but it's bothering me that I have to resort to strangers online.

Aside from getting new friends and previously mentioned methods, is there another option from therapy to talk about this stuff?

edit:thank you to everyone for responding to this post.  I'm very glad that subreddits like this exist, and I will pay it forward
