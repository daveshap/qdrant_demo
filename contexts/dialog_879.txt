SYKES: Rudyard Kipling? No shit? Listen, we just need a minute of your time...
JETSON: We'd like to ask you about a business associate of your, Warren Hubley.
HARCOURT: Yes, I heard about poor Warren. Tragic.
SYKES: You were partners with him on some Slag -- uh, Newcomer real estate thing.
HARCOURT: That's right. He and I, along with seven or eight others. Listen, gentlemen, I will be happy to assist you in any way I can -- unfortunately, at the moment, I'm overdue at another function.
