Does this count as being fired?
So a little context. I graduated with an art degree, but finding an art job and freelance is hard so I took up a part time job at an food related job. This job is at will so of course I can be let go at anytime. Basically long story short the boss emails me telling me not to come back and I got a little paper saying I’m discharged in said attachment. I guess I didn’t perform well, but she said I was doing fine last week in person a little confusing but whatever besides the point. My question is how this will impact me for future jobs if this counts as being fired.

This isn’t even a job in my career field, it was just to make money so I would hate for it to hinder my chances at getting an art job. I really did give this job my all as I do every job I just wasn’t super fast due to an ankle injury. Will this job forever be burned on my history when applying to future jobs related to my files? :( I’m really stressed about how it will impact me. I did do anything offensive or terrible I just wasn’t a good fit I guess? Boss lady didn’t explain why at all just said I’m not a good fit don’t come back.
