I got covid and couldn’t work for a month. I tried contacting my shift manager 3 days ago and she ghosted me.
So, like I said in the title, I ended up getting covid and couldn’t go back to my job as a waitress when they reopened. I was sick for a really long time because I have Asthma, but luckily I’m finally feeling healthy enough to try and go back to my normal routine.

My shift manager texted me every other week asking when I’d be ready to go back on the schedule, and I always told her that I was still too sick to go in. Three days ago, I texted her and let her know that I was finally ready to go back in.... no response. Nothing. I even texted her again and still. Nothing.

I’m starting to think that I’m somehow being fired via ghosting.... for having the coronavirus. Is this legal? Is there anything I can do about this? I’ve worked at this restaurant for 5 years and being fired this way just seems completely unacceptable. What is my next move?
