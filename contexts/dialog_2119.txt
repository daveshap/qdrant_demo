KATKA: Well, get me and Chris a drink then.
DOUG: I'll get the drinks, but not here. Let's split. I can't stand this any more, it's murdering my respect for literature.
KATKA: But I don't want to go, I am enjoying it.
DOUG: How about you Brutus?
CHRIS: Sorry Katka, but I'm with Doug on this.
DOUG: You're outnumbered Kat two to one, got to go with the majority, that's democracy.
JOSH: All I'm saying Honey is run the thing past me for Christ's sake before you get up and broadcast the crap.
HOLLY: Oh that's it? Everything I do is crap!
DOUG: So what's it going to be, Coogan's or U Vayvudoo?
KATKA: I don't care. I'm not staying out late Doug.
CHRIS: What about that squat bar you showed me, is that open on a Sunday?
DOUG: Yeah, let's check out the low-life.
