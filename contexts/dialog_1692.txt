JOE: And?
GINA: Lucy overdosed.
JOE: But she's alright.
GINA: She's in ICU.
JOE: Stupid tart.
GINA: She left a note.
JOE: Fuck you.
GINA: You need to call your dad.
JOE: Leave us alone right now.
GINA: I've booked you a flight and packed you a bag. You just need to get into a car and go.
SALLY: Would you leave us alone right now?
GINA: I love her too, Joe.
JOE: Alright, good. Thanks for your trouble. So will you leave Sally and me alone right now?
SALLY: Everybody hates the messenger.
