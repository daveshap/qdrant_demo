Research Question - Trying to identify a particular method?
Doing a study with qualitative interviews, and I didn't get a ton of participants. To enhance my study, someone on my research team mentioned adding a component of the study where I analyze/code my interviews, then send results to other subjects asking if they agree/disagree/thoughts about the results. They mentioned a specific research method, but I can't, for the life of me, remember what it's called. 

Asking here because this person is less than ideal at answering communication in a timely manner. 

Thanks for all the help!
