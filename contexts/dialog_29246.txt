PAT: I don't know if we could take one in with Rhonda and me at home alone at times.
HARRY: Oh, I wasn't pointing my finger at you. Hey, you have to think of yourself. A lot of them have all kinds of diseases and will cut your throat while you sleep. There are too many bad people out there.
JUNIOR: I appreciate you lending me a hand. That lazy ass brother of mine was suppose to help me.
HARRY: Well some folks are still waiting for their comeuppance. Don't take me wrong but you can't judge people by how you act. You're a caring person.
JUNIOR: He should be caring. That is not too much to ask.
HARRY: Ya, but you can't do the shuffle with one leg. You and your wife, in your spare time, work with the less fortunate. Now I'm not talking about you and what you do but some folks that always run to help the victim, deep down are attracted to pain and suffering and love to be near the dying.
JUNIOR: All the people working with us are really doing it 'cause they hate to see suffering.
HARRY: You never know what's in the heart and just because you can cry doesn't make you human.
JUNIOR: We can't really bring another family in here with us.
PAT: Why not? Harry says that's the only way to do good.
JUNIOR: When did you talk to Harry?
PAT: Don't shout!
