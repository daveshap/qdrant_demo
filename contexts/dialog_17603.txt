ROPER: Ray, if you walk out of here with me, I'll get you a job.
RAYMOND: Doing what? Cleaning toilets?
ROPER: I can't guarantee you what it will be. But I swear on my life, I'll find you work.
RAYMOND: And why the fuck would you do that for me?
ROPER: Not for you, Ray. For me. A close friend of mine was killed this week. The way I figure it, I stop you from doin' what you said, I'm one up on body count.
RAYMOND: Who the fuck are you, Mother Teresa?
ROPER: My name's Scott Roper.
