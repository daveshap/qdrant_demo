Apple Watch 3 - How to track movement in tennis? I have both an Apple Watch and iPhone. When I play tennis, my iPhone lays on the table. What setting do I need to set, in order for the watch to track my movement?Currently it tracks the movement of the iPhone, so during my training, it stays at 0KM for the whole time. It works like this regardless if I use Endomondo or the Workout app.
