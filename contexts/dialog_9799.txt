FLETCH: Fat Sam is turning state's evidence.
GUMMY: What's that?
FLETCH: He wrote me a nice deposition. He says he just received the drugs. You did the selling.
GUMMY: I didn't sell nothing! I didn't sell nothing! I just carried the drugs from the Chief to Sam.
FLETCH: Sure you did.
GUMMY: Fletch, I never sold nothing.
FLETCH: Twenty years.
