Something blocks Ctrl+Alt+left/right-arrow keyboard combination In Ubuntu 18.04 I'm not able to assign Ctrl+Alt+\u2190 or Ctrl+Alt+\u2192 to anything. To be precise I may bind it to something, but it doesn't work when using the keyboard combination, up/down arrows do however work. .The strange thing is that the system detects the keyboard combinations when assigning a key, but not when trying to use them. As a result the keyboard combinations don't work in any other programs either.
