Experiencing extreme burnout, depression, rumination and had to take time off. I wish I'd have done something about it before I got into this shape. Can anyone give me some advice?
I’ve been with a great company for 20 years working as a drafter/engineering tech in which I’ve experienced burnout for quite some time. I started having depression symptoms in July and tried to adjust my meds and struggled through for two months but wound up having a breakdown and having to take time off. The depression has gotten worse with wicked insomnia and problems focusing due to rumination. Right now I’m just trying to get help and focusing on healing my mind. I feel with this much skin in the game as far as time at the job I should just stick with it at least till I’m in a better place. I feel trapped anyways cause I am in a specialized field and a transition would be so difficult. I would greatly appreciate any advice.
