How to keep your emotions in check in the early stages of dating?

Iâ€™m the type of person who tends to fall fast and real hard for someone I like very early on. Sometimes I get way too ahead of my feelings and find it hard to keep my emotions in check. Lately, I find myself constantly checking my phone for replies from him and wanting to spending all my free time with him which I know is moving far too fast.

How do people keep their emotions in check at the early stages of dating? Please any advice or pep talk to help!
