NEIL: Shit!
NEIL'S FRIEND #1: Put it out, man!
JULIE: Honey? How did it go? You didn't call me.
PHIL: He wasn't there.
JULIE: What?
PHIL: I get to the restaurant and he's not there. I waited for forty- five minutes. When I called his office, his secretary said they thought I had cancelled. I had cancelled! Then I get back to my office and <u>Aranson</u> is waiting for me and he knows <u>everything</u>.
JULIE: Oh, honey.
PHIL: <u>Everything</u> -- that I've been talking to other people behind his back -- that's what he called me -- a back-stabber and a deceiver. To him and to the company. He called me a traitor in front of everybody and told me if I wanted to be a VP over at Lowenthal I might as well pack up and go -- only <u>Lowenthal never</u> <u>showed up for our lunch</u>! It's like everybody got an anonymous poison-pen letter or some -- Do you smell smoke?
