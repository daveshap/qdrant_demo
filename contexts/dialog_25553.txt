BIGGS: I'll tell you, Luke, and this is between you and me. The star force isn't all it's cracked up to be. Frankly, it's a bore, and it's going to stay that way as long as this system is neutral...
LUKE: But you always said things were so great at the academy... What happened?
BIGGS: The academy is fantastic... Of course, they won't teach you anything about flying you don't already know. Most of the instructors are very conservative pilots. You can fly circles around them... but there is a lot on the scientific side that is down-right amazing, and you get a lot of discipline... but after you graduate, don't join the star force -- go free-lance. It's the only way to get into the action... I can't wait until my hitch is up.
LUKE: At least you're doing something... I'd give anything to be in your position.
BIGGS: Just be warned, that things aren't always as they seem... especially the starforce recruiting posters.
