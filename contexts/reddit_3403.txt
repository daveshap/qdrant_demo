[VENT] Men keep using the pandemic as an excuse to skip right to “come over”
Ok guys buckle up because I am PISSED. I would say that more than half the guys I have talked to on Hinge/Bumble think they can use the pandemic to skip going out and get me to just come over. It’s frustrating because almost everything in my city has opened back up again. 

“I’m fixing myself a drink, care to join? Not safe in public.”

“I would normally take you out but I’m not going out in public right now. Come over?” 

If you “don’t want to go out in public” then why invite a complete stranger into your home? HOW ABOUT NO. We can find something distanced or outdoors to do so I can at least be afforded the opportunity to meet you in person. And if you are actually concerned about being in public then you should be prepared to wait it out AND THEN try to date. 

The killer is that they actually get pissed when I decline or propose doing something outdoors first instead. Are you kidding me? Are most women in the habit of showing up at total strangers houses? 

God!
