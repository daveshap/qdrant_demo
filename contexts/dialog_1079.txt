BERNSTEIN: Hannah, I never would have bothered you but I'm off to Miami and they're gonna take away my ten speed unless I get it straightened out fast.
HANNAH: Where are your bills, Carl?
BERNSTEIN: Oh, they're here. I'm keeping much better records now, Hannah. See?
HANNAH: Carl, it's a jungle. I suggest you either pay this immediately or lay in a large supply of candles. You'd give a stranger the shirt off your back--except it wouldn't be paid for.
BERNSTEIN: Hey... very tense.
HANNAH: Lot of pressure at the Star. Carl, when we got married, you were four thousand dollars in debt; when we split, you were solvent. That may prove to be the outstanding single achievement of my life, and now look at this. How much did the damn bike cost?
BERNSTEIN: Five hundred; six maybe.
HANNAH: You're two months behind--you got enough to cover?
BERNSTEIN: I think.
HANNAH: Give me your checkbook then.
BERNSTEIN: It's right under that pile.
HANNAH: I thought you had to get to Miami.
BERNSTEIN: There's always a later plane.
HANNAH: You're a sex junkie, you know that, Carl?
BERNSTEIN: Nobody's perfect. I'm glad you're out of it, Hannah-- you're a terrific reporter and I turned you into a bookkeeper.
