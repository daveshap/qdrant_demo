What is an overall procedure for cointegration test? I'm working on a set of macroeconomic variables form 1992M01 to 201407. They are PPI, CPI, industrial production, stock price index and exchange rate. I know that I should run a cointegration test for forecasting and it seems that the procedure is something like this:<br>1) testing for unit roots and stationarity 2) running Granger causality  test3) cointegration test Could anyone tell me about complete procedure, please?! what should I do in order to have a consistent regression of my variables? I've read so many references and I'm lost in texts!
