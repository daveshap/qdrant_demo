Recently laid off and looking to make a career change. Any advice?
I was recently laid off from a digital marketing position in the entertainment industry and have been job searching ever since. The process has been slow going so far with little to no responses to job applications. In the meantime, I've reached out to people in my network and let people know that I'm looking for a new job, so hopefully that will amount to something.

However, I'm thinking about making a switch to a different industry. As much as I love entertainment, I'm starting to question whether or not I'd really be happy continuing to work in the field. I've always been really passionate about traveling, so I've started looking at marketing opportunities in that field as well. There doesn't seem to be as many opportunities, but maybe I'm not looking in the right places.

Do you have any advice for someone who's been laid off and looking to make a career change and/or do you have any recommendations on good resources for travel jobs? Any help is greatly appreciated - thank you!
