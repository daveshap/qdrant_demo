Is Unlimited PTO a Scam?
I work in IT and I am in the market for a new job. I currently work for a fortune 50 company so the benefits are more old school but the main perk for me here is PTO.

I currently get about 28 days a year of PTO. I am also underpaid by about 20-30k. I am looking to get closer to what I should be paid but also not take a big benefits hit.

This leads me to the concept of unlimited PTO. A lot of the positions I looked into offer it.  I don't trust it, I feel like it's just a way to make workers feel guilty about taking time off and making them beg for time off they aren't technically owed.

Does anyone have any experience with it? Am I just an old guy that doesn't understand how things work these days? Can you share your thoughts?
