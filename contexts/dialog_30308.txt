MANAGERESS: Is there something I can do for you?
SCOTTIE: Yes... you run this hotel.
MANAGERESS: Oh, yes!
SCOTTIE: Would you tell me, who has the room on the second floor in the corner, that corner?
MANAGERESS: Oh, I'm afraid we couldn't give out information of that sort. Our clients are entitled to their privacy, you know. And I do believe it's against the law! Of course, I don't think any of them would mind, really, but still I would have to know who you are, and ask --
MANAGERESS: Oh, dear! Has she done something wrong?
SCOTTIE: Please answer my question.
MANAGERESS: I can't imagine that sweet girl with that dear face --
SCOTTIE: What is her name?
MANAGERESS: Valdes. Miss Valdes. It's Spanish, you know.
SCOTTIE: Carlotta Valdes?
MANAGERESS: Yes, that's it. Sweet name, isn't it? Foreign. But sweet.
SCOTTIE: How long has she had the room?
MANAGERESS: Oh, it must be two weeks. Yes, the rent's due tomorrow.
SCOTTIE: Does she sleep here? Ever?
MANAGERESS: No... she only comes to sit. Two or three times a week. And I never ask questions, you know. As long as they're well behaved. I must say that I've wondered --
SCOTTIE: When she comes down, don't say that I've been here.
MANAGERESS: Oh, but she hasn't been here today. Scottie whirls back on her.
SCOTTIE: I saw her come in five minutes. ago.
MANAGERESS: Oh, no! She hasn't been here at all! I would have seen her, you know. I've been right here all the time, putting olive oil on my rubber plant leaves!
MANAGERESS: And there! There you see? Her key is on the rack!
SCOTTIE: Would you please go and look?
MANAGERESS: In her room? Well, yes, of course if you ask. But it does seem silly...
