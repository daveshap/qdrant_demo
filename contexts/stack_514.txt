What are the implications of installing WINE while booting from a liveDVD? For various personal reasons I want to use a liveDVD for some tasks which include playing a game that works with WINE.I will be using Ubuntu or Mint because I am most familiar with those.Questions are:If I install WINE will my Linux be like a Windows in the sense that I will be infected as easily as visiting a shady website or that my Linux will auto-execute viruses that are made for Windows? (The following paragraph is related to this.)I observed that Linux in LiveDVD is always in super user mode or at least doesn't require passwords for tasks. How can I change that to either require a password or to exit super user mode? Or if it's a liveDVD then will it remain that way?Finally if I install WINE and decide to play the game, will it break the NTFS drive the game was installed on in a Windows machine? I know it will probably break the game so I made another copy of it but both are on an NTFS drive.
