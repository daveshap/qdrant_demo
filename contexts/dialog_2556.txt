GEORGE: I don't want to hit you in the stomach!
MARTY: You're not gonna hurt me. Just hit me in the stomach.
GEORGE: Look, Marty, I'm just not a fighter...
MARTY: How many times do I have to explain it to you?... We know you're not a fighter. You know it, I know it... but she doesn't know it. That's why we gotta make you look like a fighter, somebody who'll stand up for her, somebody who isn't chicken. And you're not gonna look like a fighter if you can't hit me in the stomach.
GEORGE: But I've never picked a fight in my entire life!
MARTY: You're not picking a fight, you're coming to her rescue. Maybe we'd better go over the plan again. Where are you gonna be at 8:55?
GEORGE: I'm going to be at the dance.
MARTY: And where am I gonna be?
GEORGE: In the parking lot, with her.
MARTY: Okay. So right around 9:00 she's gonna get very angry with me -
GEORGE: Why?
MARTY: Why what?
GEORGE: Why is she gonna get angry with you?
