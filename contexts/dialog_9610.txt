KIRKHILL: What's up?
TRAUTMAN: Listen, Kirkhill. I'm a bit of a fifth wheel in your setup here... I thought I'd go out with the extraction team tonight. Unless you have an objection.
KIRKHILL: It's not necessary.
TRAUTMAN: I know.
KIRKHILL: That's a pretty hairy ride. Full Colonels are supposed to be above that sort of thing.
TRAUTMAN: I know...
KIRKHILL: Have fun.
