Guys. Are you being breadcrumbed?!
If she's flirting with you, getting close to you, purposefully putting herself in your orbit.  Then ask her out on a date.  The only acceptable answers are yes or no.  Anything else (I'll let you know, maybe next week, don't you have work tomorrow?) then treat it as a "No thanks.  Not interested.". Keep it professional and move on.

If she comes back and repeats the flirting, getting close, putting herself in your orbit, ask her out again.  If she says everything but yes, then my friend, you are just around for attention (i.e - being bread-crumbed).  From here just draw the line in the sand and keep it at hi and bye.  That's it. Take back your power.  99% sure she'll come around "Oh what's wrong?" "You're acting so weird.".  Do not.  I repeat. Don't fall for it!  She knows exactly what's going on and  she's looking for a defensive retort to show she can still get attention from you.  Just tell her straight up, "We're cool.  I'll catch you around."  That's it.  These are the type of women that want 0 to do with you romantically, but if you get a girlfriend, here come all the "Hey.  How have you been?"  "We should catch up," calls/texts.  These type of women are nothing more than attention whores. Sure she'll keep you around to complain about other men, but you're not getting anywhere sexual with this girl.  Just keep it moving. **Edit :** You are deemed ***persona non grata*** ***in braca*** by this girl.

There's a reason why she is single.  And you have just witnessed firsthand.   Congratulations.  You have just saved yourself months/days/weeks of frustration.
