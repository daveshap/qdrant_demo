ROSASHARN: Ma... all this, will it hurt the baby?
MA: Now don't you go gettin' nimsy-mimsy.
ROSASHARN: Sometimes I'm all jumpy inside.
MA: Well, can't nobody get through nine *months* without sorrow.
ROSASHARN: But will it--hurt the baby?
MA: They use' to be a sayin': A chile born outa sorrow'll be a happy chile. An' another: Born outa too much joy'll be a doleful boy. That's the way I always heard it.
ROSASHARN: You don't ever get scairt, do you, Ma?
MA: Sometimes. A little. Only it ain't scairt so much. It's just waitin' an' wonderin'. But when sump'n happens that I got to do sump'n-- --I'll do it.
ROSASHARN: Don't it ever scare you it won't be nice in California like we think?
MA: No. No, it don't. I can't do that. I can't let m'self. All I can do is see how soon they gonna wanta eat again. They'd all get upset if I done anymore 'n that. They all depen' on me jus' thinkin' about that. That's my part--that an' keepin' the fambly together.
