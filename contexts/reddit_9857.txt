Virtual Programming?
Hi all, my department typically runs a whole lot of student programming and events. We've recently gone online for the rest of the semester and can't do any in-person events or gatherings.

Does anyone have any tips for trying to stay engaged with students online? We've got a pretty good presence on social media already so I'm looking for more out of the box ideas. For example, has anyone tried games on [Tabletopia](https://tabletopia.com/) or streaming content and chatting on [Metastream](https://getmetastream.com/)? 

The student group my department typically focuses on is a minority group that tends to engage well in our events, so I'm hopeful we'll be able to think of SOMETHING fun to do through the end of the semester.

Thanks in advance!
