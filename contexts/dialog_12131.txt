PENELOPE: How do you do. My name is Penelope Ryan. This is a simple-minded play about men who enjoy killing--and those who don't.
HAROLD: I am Harold Ryan, her husband. I have killed perhaps two hundred men in wars of various sorts--as a professional soldier. I have killed thousands of other animals as well--for sport.
WOODLY: I am Dr. Norbert Woodly--a physician, a healer. I find it disgusting and frightening that a killer should be a respected member of society. Gentleness must replace violence everywhere, or we are doomed.
PENELOPE: Would you like to say something about killing, Colonel?
LOOSELEAF: Jesus--I dunno. You know. What the heck. Who knows?
PENELOPE: Colonel Harper, retired now, dropped an atom bomb on Nagasaki during the Second World War, killing seventy-four thousand people in a flash.
LOOSELEAF: I dunno, boy.
PENELOPE: You don't know?
LOOSELEAF: It was a bitch.
PENELOPE: Thank you. You can leave now. We'll begin.
