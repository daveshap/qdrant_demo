Do you ever feel like suicide is your destiny?
I mean, for me at least, it's like there's no way around it. Things get better, my life improves in ways that I didn't think possible, but at the back of my mind I still have offing myself as an option.  It's always like: "Let's see where this goes. If it all goes to shit, I can still end my life".

Since the moment that I first contemplated suicide, it seems inevitable. Like I'm just waiting for a bad turn.
