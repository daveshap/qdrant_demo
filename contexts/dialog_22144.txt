LUKE: Yoda, I must know.
YODA: Your father he is.
YODA: Told you, did he?
LUKE: Yes.
YODA: Unexpected this is, and unfortunate...
LUKE: Unfortunate that I know the truth?
LUKE: Well, I'm sorry.
YODA: Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware. Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side are they. Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.
