SHUTTLE: What an awful sound!
HAROLD: Get used to it. Back door, Paul.
HAROLD: It's possible, of course, that you'll die in Africa.
SHUTTLE: I've considered that.
HAROLD: Selling vacuum cleaners isn't the best preparation you could have.
SHUTTLE: I just want one true adventure before I die.
HAROLD: That can be arranged.
PAUL: Dad?
HAROLD: Who was it?
PAUL: It's Mom.
LOOSELEAF: Hi, Penelope.
HAROLD: Shut up, you ninny! You were never to come here again-- for any reason whatsoever!
PENELOPE: I came for my clothes.
HAROLD: Sneaking in the back door.
PENELOPE: I rang. It seemed like the proper door for a servile, worthless organism to use.
HAROLD: Your clothes are at the city dump by now. Perhaps you can get a map from the Department of Sanitation.
PENELOPE: I came for Paul as well.
HAROLD: If he wants to go.
PENELOPE: You took him to the funeral, I hear.
HAROLD: He'd never seen a corpse. He's seen a dozen now.
PENELOPE: A dozen?
HAROLD: It's a big and busy funeral home.
PENELOPE: Did you like it, dear?
HAROLD: It isn't a matter of liking. It's a matter of getting used to death-- as a perfectly natural thing. Would you mind leaving? No woman ever walks out on Harold Ryan, and then comes back--for anything.
PENELOPE: Unless she has nerve.
HAROLD: More nerve than the doctor, I must admit. He hasn't been home for two days. Has he suddenly lost interest in sleep and color television--and the violin?
PENELOPE: He knows you shattered his violin.
HAROLD: I'm dying to hear of his reaction. The thrill of smashing something isn't in the smashing, but in the owner's reactions.
PENELOPE: He cried.
HAROLD: About a broomstick and a cigar box--and the attenuated intestines of an alley cat.
PENELOPE: Two hundred years old.
HAROLD: He feels awful loss--which was precisely my intention.
PENELOPE: He had hoped that someone would be playing it still--two hundred years from now.
HAROLD: Hope.
