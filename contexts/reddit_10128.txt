Weird term in declaration of finances form! Help! xPost from /r/college
So, I just got accepted into BMCC and got the new 2013 document for financial declaration, and now I'm confused over what the document actually wants me to declare.


One of the term states : Divide the personal bank funds into half because BMCC is two years.
...Just to clarify, I only have to show finances for first 9 months right? That is, One year? I'll link the PDF to anyone interested

Can anyone help? Thanks. How much amount of money am I required to show exactly?
