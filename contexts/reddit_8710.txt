Who is actually affected by the Trump administration's "public charge" rule?
First time poster, please forgive any errors in formatting.

Last October, new rules regarding who would be a public charge for immigration purposes would have gone into effect, but they were blocked by several lawsuits.  The Supreme Court has recently lifted the injunction against implementing the rule  [https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/484196-supreme-court-allow-public-charge-rule-to-take-effect-across-country](https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/484196-supreme-court-allow-public-charge-rule-to-take-effect-across-country)

According to the text of the rule ( [https://www.uscis.gov/news/fact-sheets/public-charge-fact-sheet](https://www.uscis.gov/news/fact-sheets/public-charge-fact-sheet)), the benefits that are included are:

* Supplemental Security Income;  
* Temporary Assistance for Needy Families; 
* Any federal, state, local, or tribal cash benefit programs for income maintenance (often called general assistance in the state context, but which may exist under other names);  
* Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (formerly called food stamps); 
* Section 8 Housing Assistance under the Housing Choice Voucher Program; 
* Section 8 Project-Based Rental Assistance (including Moderate Rehabilitation);  
* Public Housing (under the Housing Act of 1937, 42 U.S.C. 1437 et seq.); and 
* Federally funded Medicaid (with certain exclusions). 

The rule applies to those who are seeking to adjust their status to become a legal permanent resident or certain nonimmigrants.

However, most nonimmigrants are ineligible for these benefits  [https://immigrationforum.org/article/fact-sheet-immigrants-and-public-benefits/](https://immigrationforum.org/article/fact-sheet-immigrants-and-public-benefits/) .  If there is a U.S. Citizen child in the household that would qualify for the benefits, that is not supposed to be held against the immigrant as the child would be entitled to receive them.

There are certain exceptions to the rule, ie. these are not held against the immigrant for purposes of determining a public charge, and include-

* Emergency medical assistance;  
* Disaster relief;  
* National school lunch programs;  
* The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children ;  
* The Children’s Health Insurance Program;  
* Subsidies for foster care and adoption;  
* Government-subsidized student and mortgage loans; 
* Energy assistance;  
* Food pantries and homeless shelters; and 
* Head Start.    

Certain categories of immigrants are also excluded, including refugees, asylees, T and U Visa applicants, and certain VAWA applicants.

So, my question is- Given that the vast majority of federal public benefits are off-limits to nonimmigrants, and the groups of people and types of assistance that are already not subject to the rule, who will actually be affected?
