What do you call a person who silently waits for something/one to fail and then overreacts publicly about it? How do you call somebody who's never there to give advice/help on executing a task and almost secretly waits/hope until someone/something fails and then immediately overreacts by loudly/publicly exposing how flawed/poor the task execution was?
