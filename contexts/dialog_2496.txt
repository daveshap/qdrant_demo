RICCO: See that patch of shirt? We wondered about the discoloration so he ran a spectro. On a lucky shot we picked up some traces of Trychticholorate. Nobody around here had ever heard of it.
SHADOW: Trychticholorate? Alright, it's an absorption catalyst in toxic waste accidents. It's pretty rare, they stopped making it a couple'a years ago.
RICCO: Probably got in Cosgrove's clothes in a gas state from the fire.
SHADOW: What the hell was it doing in the fire?
RICCO: That's your job.
