EDWARD: One more night and you're finally rid of me.
VIVIAN: Yeah, you've been pretty tough to take.
EDWARD: I have to go to New York tomorrow.
VIVIAN: What else? You gonna leave some cash by the bed when you pass through town?
EDWARD: It wouldn't be like that. I want to get you off the street. You'll have a different kind of life. What's wrong with that?
VIVIAN: I'm sorry. That's very sweet, Edward, and I know you mean it...
EDWARD: Vivian, I've thought about this a lot. This is the best solution.
VIVIAN: When I was a little girl, my mother locked me in the attic when I was bad, which was pretty often. I'd stare out the window up there and make believe I was a princess trapped in the tower by the wicked queen. Then suddenly a knight on a white horse with his bright colors flying would ride up. Rescue me from the tower, and then we'd ride off... but never, ever in all the times I had that dream did the knight say, Come on baby
EDWARD: Vivian, life's not a fairy tale.
VIVIAN: I know. Hey, don't mind me. I'm being stupid. I'll think about it, okay? It's a real good offer for a whore.
EDWARD: I've never treated you like a whore.
VIVIAN: You just did.
KROSS: Mr. Harris.
EDWARD: How are you, Mr. Kross.
KROSS: Not bad for a man who hasn't slept in four nights. I'll get used to it.
