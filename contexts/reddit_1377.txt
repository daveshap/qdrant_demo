Saw someone else post this recently but I got a job ☺️ I’m so happy. I just listened to everything my gf said and slowly figured everything out. She is a blessing. You can do it!!!!!!
All I did was make a profile on the indeed app(yea I sound like a shill but fr) and applied to 7 jobs in seconds this morning. This afternoon got a call from one of them and went in for an interview.  I decided to just be myself and not worry about the interview, to treat them like a friend. They have something to gain from me and I have something to gain from them? Thats how I went into it and it worked ☺️ I’m so proud.  Omg.  Sorry.  I know I’m not special. But I had such a massive panic attack last night I thought I would never pull out of it. Today is so different ☺️
