How can i get a job editing videos where i can work from home?
Hi, so there's something i've always been good at. It's editing videos. I have a good computer and decent editing software.


But, i want to market my skills and use them for gain. 


Basically, i want to become kind of a freelance editor, like, someone send me their videos or footage online and i'll edit it together for them. Like, a wedding video or something. Kind of like that.


I'd rather work from home, if possible, (rather then like, an office or something). Because i am somewhat disabled, i have knee problems and limited mobility so i can't really get around very well, i just think it'd be better.


So, my question is, how do i go about doing this? I don't have much "formal" training with this, i didn't go to college or anything, but i did learn a lot about editing in high school broadcasting class.


I honestly think i could make a career off this, i love editing videos,


Any help you can give me
