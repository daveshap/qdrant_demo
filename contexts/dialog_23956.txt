UNCLE AL: You got a pilot's license, Marty?
MARTY: Do I need one?
UNCLE AL: We're gonna find out. Take it down the road a ways and back. Be careful.
UNCLE AL: You gave me a heart attack, Marty. I'm dying. I hope you're happy, because you are looking at a dying man.
MARTY: It really goes fast. Thanks, Uncle Al.
UNCLE AL: It goes fast, all right- and if your mother finds out just how fast, Marty, I will have a new job. Singing soprano with the Vienna Boys' Choir.
MARTY: I don't get you.
UNCLE AL: I know you don't. But I want this to be our secret. You get that, don't you?
MARTY: Sure.
UNCLE AL: Good.
