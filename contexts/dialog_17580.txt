ROPER: They're not usually graduate students.
BAFFERT: SWAT wants to go in.
ROPER: What's the rush? They haven't killed anybody yet this week?
ROPER: We got a guy who's probably on drugs. He's got a record of 459's and he was busted on possession. But he's never been busted on a major felony. What's his demeanor?
KIMURA: Well he's a little fucking agitated -- he ripped the phone out.
ROPER: I have to go face to face.
BAFFERT: No -- you can't do that.
ROPER: You got 7 hostages in there, 1 of them's wounded -- We don't know how bad it is -- The guy ripped the phone out -- SWAT said he's got a gun to the head of a female hostage. If SWAT makes entry now, you're gonna lose 1 hostage, maybe 2. I gotta go in. Maybe I can see what's going on in there.
BAFFERT: I don't know.
ROPER: He's never offed anybody. His rap doesn't show any violence.
BAFFERT: Not that we know of.
ROPER: We don't know how much time we have. If I can get in to talk to him -- maybe we won't lose anyone.
BAFFERT: Maybe we can get a throw phone in there.
