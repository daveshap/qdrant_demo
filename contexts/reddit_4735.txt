Depression getting worse, can't get treatment soon, and going broke
Long story short since escaping an abusive parent that financially supported me I've been jobless and I'm running out of money (don't worry I'm not asking for any money, just advice). This is a time in my life where I need to double down, try and get a job, and get my shit together. Because if I don't I'll literally won't be able to pay my bills and live, right? 

Well that last part is certainly true. But ever since three months ago I've had a terrible depression (and also symptoms of ptsd) and it's been getting worse. I always feel empty, unmotivated, and tired. Things I used to enjoy I don't anymore. I don't really feel much of anything lately except for emptiness, boredom, and sometimes anger. I'm 100% certain I have ptsd and depression but can't get a diagnosis until I get an appointment with a psychiatrist and that'll take a month with my free public health insurance. So not only am I not able to function with my depression with things like eating and sleeping let alone job seeking, I'm in a situation where I can't immediately get help *and* where if I don't get a job within the next month I'll be fucked. Is there any way I can cope or did method I can do to get myself mentally sound enough to get a job, at least until I can get the treatment I need? I'm just do overwhelmed and I don't know what to do. Thanks guys.
