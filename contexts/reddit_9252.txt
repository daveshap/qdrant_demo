So for the last ten years I've been learning to get by with basically no financial literacy. Because of that i want to make a Poverty Finance Guide with the things I've been learning
Hey yall- I've been learning for the past few years that a big part of why I had so many troubles saving and budgeting were because i had little to no financial literacy. I didn't know much about bank accounts, savings, loans, student loans, making a budget, ect. 

&#x200B;

I started dating this amazing woman who didn't grow up poor, and i was astonished to find that a huge difference between our saving and spending habits came from the fact that she was taught about finances at an early age. Where i spend money on food because i get scared ill go hungry she buys what she needs and saves. Where i cant always see how spending 5$here and 110 $ there is bad she counts every dollar, and as such can really save. 

&#x200B;

This kind of inspired me- i started learning about different financial terminology, the basics of budgeting adn saving, and other stuff- the truth is that i learned SO MUCH. I'm still not in the best place financially. I have no savings- I am only starting to pay off debt, but in the end even the small steps im taking is making a huge difference.  so in the spirit of this i want to share what i've learned because maybe itll help someone.

# Banking 101

Ok so, banks may seem like the most basic thing ever- but the truth is for a long time i didnt even want a bank account, it seemed like a useless way to store money that i needed and way gonna use. Plus overdraft fees terrified me. Turns out I was holding myself back quite a bit.

SO with all that out of the way...

# Why have a bank account? 

The truth is in today's market you don't always need one. Before when i didn't have one i would cash my cheques directly for about 3$. The teller at the store knew me, and sometimes would let me get an extra 10 or 20$ in advance, knowing that id have a cheque for her later.  As i started earning more though I also realized a few things: 

* Building a credit history:  people need to know you, wanna get an apartment?  need credit. wanna get a cerd? a loan? anything? credit.
* Banks keep money safe: its not safe to carry around 100s of dollars. This seems obvious but the anxiety i felt coming home with cash in my bag was ridiculous. Not only that my apartment got broken into and my computer stolen- what if they'd found my cash too? 
* Its actually more convenient:  Wanna buy shit online? done. Wanna use plastic for everything? done. wanna do literally anything that requires a card? done. 
* You can save:  So eventually the hope is that youre making more money than youre spending. Its used to be that if that happened i would just spend that too. But no- a savings account actually allows you to keep that money away, safe, where you need it for emergencies or whatever. 

Ok so all of that probably seemed really obvious. It wasnt for me and maybe i'm a dumbass, I get that. So finally lets talk about...

# Opening an account

&#x200B;

First- Bank or Co-op?

Big banks have the advantage of convenience and the ability to be everywhere, that said Co-ops tend to be more family friendly, you get to know the community, are much more personal, and usually have better loans. Honestly here its all about preference. I have an account with a local Co-op, which gives me access to a lot of great  offers- but i also have a bank account with a big bank. The big bank u use for checking, the co-op for savings. It works for me. Look at what you have nearby and what they require and choose what fits you best. 

Second you need to choose what type of account, for the sake of this guide we'll talk about checking and savings. 

|Checking account|Savings account|
|:-|:-|
|Used to store money, pay bills, get a card, write cheques|Used to store money long term, save money, build an emergency fund|

So once youve identified what kind of account youll be getting you need to figure out where you want to open one- so what should we be looking for? 

&#x200B;

Checking:

* Look for accounts that have no monthly fees. You dont want to lose money by paying a fee every month jsut to store money in the account. 
* No overdraft fees. Right now theres a wide enough selection that you can get an account with no overdraft fees- protecting you from the RIDICULOUS fees that can come with an overdraft. 
* Good online presence. The truth is nowadays having a convenient way to look at your accounts wherever is super amazing and useful.  Even my tiny co-op has an app.

Savings: 

* Look for higher interest/APY the higher the more they pay you for keeping your money in there
* Look for accounts with no monthly fees. Seriously, youre already giving them your money dont let them keep it. 
* Mobile deposits. For those of us who get paper cheques its nice to just snap a pic. 
* No transfer fees. Most of the time you open a checking and savings account together- you can only transfer money out of a savings account a certain amount of times a month before they start charging you, this is due to federal regulatory stuff- keep an eye on it. 

So now youve found some account you like with banks you think are ok- whats next? 

&#x200B;

To open an account you need a minimum deposit- this varies depending on your bank. Some require just 1.50$ others 25$, others 50$ I suggest writing whatever your deposit is as money lost and ALWAYS keep that minimum there. That said i can never do that, but hey- dont be like me, be better than me. 

&#x200B;

So what now? 

&#x200B;

Thats it, thats this guide. Note that there are many other checking accounts, savings accounts, money market, IRA, and a bunch of other bullshit. The truth is that when your poor that shit is out of our league. just having a good checking and savings account is a huge step for a lot of us- so with this guide i wanted to start there.

Thanks yall, let me know what you think and i hope this can help someone.
