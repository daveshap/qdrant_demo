How did Garland initally travel backwards in time? At the beginning of the game, the Warriors of Light, Garland, and the Four Elemental Fiends are already caught well within the time loop.2000 years before the Warriors of Light appear, Garland's hatred for the Warriors corrupts the elements and creates the Fiends. The Fiends are then sent forward in time using Garland's newfound power and, in the present, the Fiends use their combined power to send a dying Garland backwards.My question is: How did Garland initially end up 2000 years in the past?Is this addressed in any related media (such as the novelisation Memory of Heroes)? Within the game itself?
