I delete posts and comments before posting them, because I fear the reaction. Does anyone else get this?
I could write a bunch of text about something, and then I fear that the post/comment will give off the wrong impression.

That I sound like an asshole or that I don’t know enough about the subject. 

Edit: Just came with another example. 
Me and a group of friends have a snapchat group chat. It’s almost the only way to get in touch with them, so that’s what I use Snapchat for.
And when I started writing there and then deleted it, I realized how much I delete texts there.
It’s like every other text I try to write is deleted by me when I have had enough time coming up with as many reactions to the text as I can.
