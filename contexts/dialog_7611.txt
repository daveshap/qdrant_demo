DONNIE: Hey...
GRETCHEN: Hey...
DONNIE: School's cancelled.
GRETCHEN: Wanna walk me home?
DONNIE: Sure.
GRETCHEN: Don't look so freaked.
DONNIE: I'm not. But you should check your backpack 'cause those guys like to steal shit.
GRETCHEN: Fuck them.
DONNIE: So... you just moved here?
GRETCHEN: Yeah. My parents got divorced. My mom has a restraining order against my stepdad. He has... emotional problems.
DONNIE: Oh, I... have those too. What kind of problems does your dad have?
GRETCHEN: He stabbed my mom four times in the chest.
DONNIE: Wow. Did he go to jail?
GRETCHEN: He fled. They still can't find him. My mom and I had to change our names and stuff. I thought Gretchen sounded kind of cool.
DONNIE: I'm sorry. I was in jail once. I accidentally burned down this house. It was abandoned. I got held back in school again. Can't drive until I'm eighteen. I think when I grow up I want to be a painter. Or maybe a writer or maybe both. Then I'll write a book and draw the illustrations like a comic book. You know, change things.
GRETCHEN: Donnie Darko is a cool name. Sounds like a superhero.
DONNIE: What makes you think I'm not?
GRETCHEN: I should go. For physics. Monnitoff says I have to write an essay on the greatest invention ever to benefit mankind.
DONNIE: That's easy. Antiseptics.
DONNIE: I mean, the whole sanitation thing. Joseph Lister... 1895. Before antiseptics there was no sanitation, especially in medicine.
GRETCHEN: You mean soap?
DONNIE: Don't knock soap. Without it, disease would spread rapidly. If we ran out... you and I would never live to see the year 2000.
GRETCHEN: Wonder where we'll be then.
DONNIE: The best thing about soap is that it's the only thing on earth that can never get dirty. No matter what crap you throw on it... it always rubs off. And there it is again... perfect.
GRETCHEN: Until it withers away.
DONNIE: It's a good thing the school was flooded today.
GRETCHEN: Why is that?
DONNIE: We never would have had this conversation.
GRETCHEN: You're weird.
DONNIE: I'm sorry.
GRETCHEN: That was a compliment.
DONNIE: Will you go with me?
GRETCHEN: Where are we going?
DONNIE: No... I mean, will you GO with me? That's like... what they call it here. Going together.
GRETCHEN: Sure.
DONNIE: Where are you going?
GRETCHEN: I'm going home.
DR. THURMAN: And when I clap my hands twice, you will wake up. Do you understand?
DONNIE: Yes.
DR. THURMAN: So, tell me about your day, Donald.
DONNIE: I met a girl.
DR. THURMAN: What is her name?
DONNIE: Gretchen. We're going together now.
DR. THURMAN: Do you think a lot about girls?
DONNIE: Yes.
DR. THURMAN: How are things going at school?
DONNIE: I think about girls a lot.
DR. THURMAN: I asked you about school.
DONNIE: I think about... fucking a lot during school.
DR. THURMAN: What else do you think about during school?
DONNIE: I think... about... Who's the Boss?""
DR. THURMAN: Who is the boss?
DONNIE: I just turn the volume down and think about fucking Alyssa Milano.
DR. THURMAN: What about your family, Donnie?
DONNIE: No, I don't think about fucking my family. That's sick!
DR. THURMAN: Donnie... I want to hear about your friend Frank.
