I love them but not their actions...
I have this best friend and we’ve been best friends for roughly a year now. At one point she wore me off alcohol and today I’m 8 months sober from alcoholism because of her. Recently she’s been drinking a lot and using a pen. I told her I didn’t like it and that it made me nervous and all she said was she knew and she’d be careful. Do I have the right to be made at her for that kind of stuff even after i told her I didn’t like her using those things? 

TL;DR. Do I have a right to be mad at my best friend for drinking and using a pen after I told her I didn’t like it?
