TRAVIS: ...there's plenty of movies around here. I haven't seen any of them, but I'm sure they're good.
BETSY: No, Travis. You're a sweet guy and all that, but I think this is it. I'm going home.
TRAVIS: You mean you don't want to go to a movie? There's plenty of movies around here.
BETSY: No, I don't feel so good. We're just two very different kinds of people, that's all.
TRAVIS: Huh?
BETSY: It's very simple. You go your way, I'll go mine. Thanks anyway, Travis.
TRAVIS: But... Betsy...
BETSY: I'm getting a taxi.
TRAVIS: What about the record?
BETSY: Keep it.
TRAVIS: Can I call you?
