EARL: Reckon he hated Perfection more than us? You suppose he <u>wanted</u> to kill himself?
VAL: If he did, why didn't he use his damn shotgun?
EARL: Maybe he just couldn't pull the trigger...
VAL: Oh sure, he figured it was easier to die of thirst? Come on, sombody must've chased him up there.
EARL: Oh, you mean somebody who ain't scared of a twelve gauge shotgun. And then what did they do? Camp out down below and just wait for him to die?
VAL: Well, whatever the hell happened it's just one more goddamn good reason to haul ass out of this place.
EARL: You got that right.
VAL: Probably up a pole starving itself to death.
EARL: Okay, the plan is: pedal to the metal the whole way. We don't stop till we hit the carwash, not even to pee.
VAL: I'll go with that plan.
