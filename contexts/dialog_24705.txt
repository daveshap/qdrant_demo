REBECCA: That's right!
DAVID LEE: Where did it come from, Mama?
REBECCA: Where all meat come from -- now git yourself washed up and be snappy about it -- you got six miles ahead of you to that school.

NATHAN LEE: Mornin'...
REBECCA: You ready to eat?
NATHAN LEE: I'll wait till after the children.
NATHAN LEE: How's the weather out there?
REBECCA: Little chilly.
NATHAN LEE: Hope it don't freeze out our baseball game today!
