CLAIRE: They're dead. Jim's dead.
ETHAN: Take off your coat.
CLAIRE: What?
ETHAN: Take off your God damn coat!
ETHAN: Where were you?
CLAIRE: I walked away. He said abort. He was gone so I walked away.
ETHAN: That was four hours ago! Who sent you? Did they send you here?
CLAIRE: Who is they?""
ETHAN: Did they send you...Did they send you?
CLAIRE: Who is they, who is they?
ETHAN: Who sent you?! Who sent you?
CLAIRE: No one sent me! We're supposed to be back here at four o'clock, four o'clock, if we abort, we don't return here until four o'clock, 0-four hundred, four am, four o'clock --!
CLAIRE: Why haven't they brought us in yet?
ETHAN: I've been disavowed. They think I killed Jim and everyone else. Somehow a hundred thousand dollars found its way into my parents' bank account. Kittridge assumes I'm a mole they've been tracing and I've been in the employ of an arms dealer, Max, for the last two years, to get him our NOC list.
CLAIRE: What are you going to do?
ETHAN: I'm going to get it for him. Whoever the mole is, I think goes by the name of Job, at least part of the time. 1 can't find him, but if he knows 1 have the NOC list, he'll find me.
CLAIRE: Ethan, you're not making sense. Let me go in and talk to Kittridge. I'm going to tell him you had nothing to do...
ETHAN: Claire, Claire, Claire, if you're not dead, he's going to assume you're with me.
CLAIRE: The message is for Job.
ETHAN: I'm going to answer it.
