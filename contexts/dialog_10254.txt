JASON: Yes... Hi Sarris... How are you doing?
SARRIS: Better than my Lieutenant. He failed to activate ship's neutron armor as quickly as I'd hoped on our last encounter.
JASON: Right. Well... Listen, I'm I'm sorry about that whole... thing.. before. It was kind of a misunderstanding. I'm sure we can work this out like reasonable people... How's the uh... ... that going to heal up? God, I hope so, I feel just awful about that.
SARRIS: Deliver the device now or I will destroy your ship.
JASON: Listen, I'd like to, but frankly.. I'm not even sure where it is, or even...
SARRIS: You have ten seconds.
JASON: All right. You got it. You win. I'll deliver it now. Just give me a moment to set it up.
JASON: All right, now nobody panic, I've dealt with this guy before and believe me, he's as stupid as he is ugly.
GWEN: Jason..
JASON: We're going to fire everything we've got at him, all right?
GWEN: JASON...
JASON: You just keep pushing those buttons, those there, send everything at him, okay?
GUY: ...Okay
JASON: All right. Put me back on with him.
