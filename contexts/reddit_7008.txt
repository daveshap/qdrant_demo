I was Terminated/Laid Off my job, need advice
I was recently let go from my job not due to performance but because the company said they are heading in a "different direction."

A little back story - Around December 2018, new ownership came in and started making a lot of changes, one of those changes were letting people go. My department was one of the first hit and there were obvious signs that my deparment would be reduced greatly.

Fast forward to March - I was brought in and was told that they are letting me go and said that they are moving in a different direction. I asked for what reason based on the direction of the company, why I would not be kept. They would not provide me any information. They would not give me any type of feedback as much as I probed. I have never had any discplinary action nor have I ever signed any type of Performance improvement plan prior to the meeting. 

I never spoke to HR as well. 

I am trying to figure the best way to let future employers know of my situation. I am just being upfront, giving them the whole story. 

I look at this sitation as being laid off due to downsizing but I know the company is going to say they fired me. 

Any advice or thoughts would be apprecaited.
