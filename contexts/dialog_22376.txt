SAM: It's a cocktail. Mostly demerol, cut with a little crank because we might need you awake in the real near future.
LARRY: Fine with fucking me, we got work to do. I don't care what it takes, we are getting our property back and putting it into the hands of the people who are gonna pay us a great deal of money when we do. I don't know about the rest of you guys, but I'm not the kind of guy to just sit back and take it in the ass. I don't mean that in, like, a literal way...
DEIRDRE: Of course.
VINCENT: Finding this package is a thing easier said than done. We don't even know what it is. What did we steal?
DEIRDRE: I don't know.
VINCENT: When this whole thing started you made it clear: you're running the show. And I don't believe you'd be running this show if you didn't know what was going on.
DEIRDRE: Well I don't!
VINCENT: And I don't believe you...
DEIRDRE: You go shoot me if you want, Vincent, but you'll be dead before I hit the ground.
VINCENT: I don't want you dead, woman, I want the the truth!
