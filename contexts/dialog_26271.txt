NORMA: Wait a minute. I want you to get out the car. You're going to take the script over to Paramount and deliver it to Mr. De Mille in person.
MAX: Yes, Madame.
GILLIS: You're really going to send it to De Mille?
NORMA: This is the right day.
GILLIS: Did she read the script?
NORMA: DeMille is Leo. I'm Scorpio. Mars has been transmitting Jupiter for weeks. Today is the day of greatest conjuction. Now turn around. Let me dry you.
GILLIS: I hope you realize, Norma, that scripts don't sell on astrologers' charts.
NORMA: I'm not just selling the script. I'm selling me. DeMille always said I was his greatest star.
GILLIS: When did he say it, Norma?
NORMA: So he said it quite a few years ago. So what? I never looked better in my life. Do you know why? Because I've never been as happy in my life.
