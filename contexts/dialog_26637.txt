SAM: No, Billy. We can't drop the lawsuit. You know how much we need the money.
BILLY: Why? You got money from Dolores' insurance with the school board. We all did.
SAM: It's not enough. For hospital bills. For Nicole.
BILLY: I'll help pay for Nicole, if that's what you're really talking about. I'll even give you the money I got for my kids. That's what we used to do, remember? Help each other. This was a community.
SAM: I'm sorry.
BILLY: I used to like it here. I used to care about what happened. Now I think I'll sell my house and move the fuck away.
MARY: Billy, please. The children.
BILLY: The children.
BILLY: How is Nicole? Is she around?
MARY: She's resting. In her room.
BILLY: Say hello for me.
