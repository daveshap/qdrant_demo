PRESIDENT MUFFLEY: At the bottom of mines?
VON KLUTZ: Yes. The radioactivity could not penetrate a mine some thousands of feet deep.
VON KLUTZ: In a matter of weeks, sufficient improvements for a dwelling space could be provided.
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY: But they couldn't come out for a hundred years!
VON KLUTZ: Mister President, man is an amazingly adaptable creature. After all, the conditions would be far superior to those, say, of the Nazi concentration camps, where there is ample evidence most of the wretched creatures clung desperately to life.
VON KLUTZ: It would not be difficult. Nuclear reactors could provide power almost indefinitely. Greenhouses could maintain plant life. Animals could be bred and slaughtered. A quick survey would have to be made of all the suitable minesites in the country, but I shouldn't be surprised if several hundred thousand of our people could be accomodatedd. Every nation would undoubtedly follow suit.
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY: But who would be chosen?
VON KLUTZ: A special committee would have to be appointed to study and recommend the criteria to be employed, but off-hand, I should say that in addition to the factors of youth, health, sexual fertility, intelligence, and a cross-section of necessary skills, it would be absolutely vital that our top government and military men be included, to impart the required principles of leadership and tradition.
