Is it feasible to remove non-functional via pads on outer layers During PCB design &amp; manufacture it is common to remove the via annular rings on internal layers where the via is not connected to anything, so called non-functional pad removal.Would it be feasible to remove a non-functional pad on an outer layer? Would this introduce any manufacturing or reliability problems?As a real-world example, I have a 4-layer PCB design with two outer signal layers, and two inner power layers. A BGA chip on the top layer connects to a power layer through a via, and this via takes unnecessary space on the bottom signal layer. Could this pad be removed to reclaim space for better clearance or routing density on the bottom layer?
