JOKER: Like your boyfriend. He's kinda hot.
BATMAN: Take me. Let the boy go.
JOKER: Gosh, I could kill you, but then you'd miss my party. And you, Batman -- you're the guest of honor!
BATMAN: What are you talking about?
JOKER: Batman! Don't you even recognize your old pal Jack? After all... ... You made me what I am today.
