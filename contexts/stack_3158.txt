Can the creator of a fictional universe get their own lore wrong? I'm uncertain if this has been asked before, or if I'm asking it on the correct exchange. If it's misplaced I apologize.My friend (who is a self-proclaimed Warcraft lore buff) and I were watching a trailer for a World of Warcraft expansion (I believe it to be Warlords of Draenor) and at some point he mentioned that they (Blizzard) got an event wrong, as he watched the scene play out differently during his time with Warcraft 3.This got me thinking, is it possible for Blizzard to incorrectly portray an event that occurred in a Universe that they are the authors of, or would the latest portrayal of an event essentially \"overwrite\" their previous portrayal, since they're the creators of the event in the first place?
