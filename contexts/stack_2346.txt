Move Fable TLC saved games to Fable Anniversary I'd like to move my Fable TLC save from OSX to Fable Anniversary on Win7.The directory contents look identical (Autosave, Autosave.qa, Profile.bin, and some manual saves), however, then Anniversaries loads it crashes bringing up the book that holds the profiles.If I replace the saves and not the profile, (putting the saves into an existing profile), I can see the saved games, but it crashes on loading.Anything I can do to help do the migration? Seems pretty close already.
