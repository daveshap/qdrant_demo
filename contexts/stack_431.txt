recover from lost /home I am struggling to do this after a disk failure where my /home partition is held. I am unable to login on my original system but can use a live USB. I have the original 16.04 system on a separate disk. Duplicity backup of /home on another disk.I have created a new partition for my new home but do not know how to continue. I am not afraid of a fresh install if necessary, but since I have a backup do I need to? Edit: no need for fresh install, the two answers below got me going, once I followed them exactly. I had everything I needed to reinstate my /home/user on a fresh partition.
