JESSE: I think I better go. I'm just not into it tonight. I'm sorry.
LISA: Why won't you talk to me?
JESSE: Will you leave me alone? Please.
LISA: You're not being fair to me. I'm worried about you and I want to help you get through this thing.
JESSE: What are you gonna do? How are you gonna help? I'm losing my mind. I don't want to have you watch me fall apart.
