WELLS: Yessir, that's correct. I know 'em when I see 'em.
MAN: When did you last see him.
WELLS: November the 28th, last year.
MAN: You seem pretty sure of the date. Did I ask you to sit?
WELLS: No sir but you struck me as a man who wouldn't want to waste a chair. I remember dates. Names. Numbers. I saw him on November 28th.
MAN: We got a loose cannon here. And we're out a bunch of money, and the other party is out his product.
WELLS: Yessir. I understand that.
