SUGAR: I wish they'd put us in the same room.
JOE: So do I. But don't worry - we'll be seeing a lot of each other.
SUGAR: 414 - that's the same room number I had in Cincinnati - my last time around with a male band. What a heel he was.
JOE: Saxophone player?
SUGAR: What else? And was I ever crazy about him. Two in the morning, he sent me down for knackwurst and potato salad - they were out of potato salad, so I brought coleslaw - so he threw it right in my face.
JOE: Forget it, Sugar, will you? Forget about saxophone players. You're going to meet a millionaire - a young one.
SUGAR: What makes you so sure?
JOE: Just my feminine intuition.
BELLHOP: Are these your bags?
JOE: Yes. And that one, too.
BELLHOP: Okay, doll.
JOE: I suppose you want a tip?
BELLHOP: Forget it, doll. After all, you work here - I work here - and believe you me, it's nice to have you with the organization.
JOE: Bye.
BELLHOP: Listen, doll - what time do you get off tonight?
JOE: Why?
BELLHOP: Because I'm working the night shift - and I got a bottle of gin stashed away - and as soon as there's a lull -
JOE: Aren't you a little too young for that, sonny?
BELLHOP: Wanna see my driver's license?
JOE: Get lost, will you?
BELLHOP: That's the way I like 'em - big and sassy. And get rid of your roommate.
