HAMMOND: You got a girl... shit... the generosityof women never ceases to amaze me.
HAMMOND: Hey, no way. Take off the bracelets or no deal.
CATES: You just don't get it, do your Reggie? There isn't any deal. I own your ass.
HAMMOND: No way to start a partnership.
CATES: Get this. We ain't partners. We ain't brothers. We ain't friends. I'm puttin' you down and keepin' you down until Ganz is locked up or dead. And if Ganz gets away, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
HAMMOND: Shit. I'm already sorry.
