DANTE: He still hasn't shown up. Why aren't you in class?
VERONICA: Lit 101 got canceled, so I stopped home and brought you some lunch.
DANTE: What is it?
VERONICA: Peanut butter and jelly with the crusts cut off. What do you think it is? It's lasagne.
DANTE: Really? You're the best.
VERONICA: I'm glad you've calmed down a bit. Hi, Randal.
RANDAL: Thirty-seven!
DANTE: Shut up! Yes, I've calmed down, I'm still not happy about it, but I've been able to deal.
