SCOTTIE: Oh, Judy!! When he had all her money, and the freedom and the power... he ditched you? What a shame! But he knew he was safe. You couldn't talk. Didn't he give you anything?
JUDY: Some money.
SCOTTIE: And the necklace. Carlotta's necklace. That was your mistake, Judy. One shouldn't keep souvenirs of a killing. You shouldn't have been that sentimental.
JUDY: What are you going to do?
SCOTTIE: I loved you, Madeleine.
JUDY: I was safe when you found me, there was nothing you could prove! But when I saw you again I couldn't run away, I loved you so! I walked into danger and let you change me again because I loved you and wanted you! Scottie, please! You love me now! Love me! Keep me safe!
JUDY: Love me... keep me safe...
SCOTTIE: Too late... too late... there's no bringing her back.
