LULA: I'll drop mama a postcard from somewhere. I mean, I don't want her to worry no more'n necessary.
SAILOR: What do you mean by necessary? She's prob'ly already called the cops, my parole officer, her p.i. boyfriend Johnnie Farragut.
LULA: I suppose so. She knew I was bound to see you soon as you was sprung, but I don't figure she counted on us takin' off together like this... I guess this means you're breakin' parole, then?
SAILOR: You guess? My parole was broke two hundred miles back when we burnt Portagee County.
LULA: What'll it be like in California, Sailor, do you think? I hear it don't rain much there.
SAILOR: You got about six more big states to go before we find out.
LULA: We got through two states already.
SAILOR: That don't smell like a More.
LULA: It ain't. It's part of the lessons of life. I picked me up a pack of Vantages before we left the Cape?
SAILOR: They sure do stink.
LULA: Yeah, I guess, but - and here's the lesson part - they ain't supposed to be so bad for you.
SAILOR: You ain't gonna begin worryin' about what's bad for you at this hour, are you, sugar? I mean, here you are crossin' state lines with a A-Number One certified murderer.
LULA: Manslaughterer, honey, not murderer. Don't exaggerate.
SAILOR: Okay, manslaughterer who's broke his parole and got in mind nothin' but immoral purposes far's you're concerned.
LULA: Thank the Lord. Well, you ain't let me down yet, Sailor. That's more'n I can say for the rest of the world?
