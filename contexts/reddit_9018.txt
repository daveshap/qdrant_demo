The discussed Vaccine Safety Committee - has it been created? Has Trump initiated any policies regarding vaccines
I've been trying to find information on the current status of vaccines on a national level in United States of America. Without luck.

I find this particularly interesting due to [Trump's statements about vaccines in 2012 and 2014](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=trump+tweets+vaccines&atb=v131-7_g&iax=images&ia=images) and the global significance/impact of the US presidency with regard to strategical approaches to public health issues.

[In 2015 he was pro](https://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/donald-trump-vaccines-autism), [but did claim that children of his employees got autism from vaccines.](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/sep/17/donald-trump-vaccines-autism-debate) In addition to not being sure about the safetey of the amount of vaccines given within a short period of time. [In 2016, he hosted known anti-vaxxers at a donors event](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/11/trump-met-prominent-anti-vaccine-activists-during-campaign). [In 2017 it was said that Robert Kennedy jr (a vaccines leads to autism-activist) was to head a new committee to look into vaccine safety.](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-appoints-robert-kennedy-jr-chair-vaccine-safety-committee-sceptic-autism-conspiracy-a7520351.html)

Since then, Iâ€™ve not seen much about that committee. [The administration never confirmed that Kennedy was to head the committee, but acknowledged that there had been talks.](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/10/vaccination-safety-robert-kennedy-jr-chair-commission-trump)

I only mention his previous statements regarding vaccines to underline the legitimacy of my uncertainty regarding the attitude the current administration holds towards vaccines.

&#x200B;

Will there be a vaccine safety committee? Are there any ongoing vaccine efforts (pro, neutral or against) initiated by this administration? Has there been budget cuts/increases to posts (if any) regarding vaccines?
