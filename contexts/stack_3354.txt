Are Spiderman's Web Shooters Biological or Artificial? I am confused. I thought Spiderman's ability to shoot web was through biologically built-in nodules in his wrists due to the mutations that happened when he was bitten by the spider. But then in MCU films and the most recent Spider-verse film by Sony, we see that he's using artificial shooters on his wrists. So which is more original to Spider-canon? Is his ability to shoot/produce web supposed to be biological as part of the mutation? Or was it always artificial?
