MILLER: Peters, I want you to go through the ship's log, see if we can't find some answers.
PETERS: I can use the station in Medical, keep an eye on Justin...
MILLER: Fine. Starck, I want you to repeat the bio-scan...
STARCK: What's the point? I'll just get the same thing...
MILLER: Not acceptable. I want to know what's causing those readings. If the crew is dead, I want the bodies, I want the crew found.
STARCK: I can reconfigure the scan for C-12, amylase proteins.
MILLER: Do it. Dr. Weir...
WEIR: Yes.
MILLER: One of my men is down. I want to know what happened to him.
