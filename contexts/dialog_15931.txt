LILI: What was that? Did you hear that?
BARON: It's nothing. My men take great delight in routing the enemy. Don't trouble yourself, beauty.
LILI: It sounded like it came from the courtyard.
BARON: From the parapets most likely. The men are amused by a battlefield entertainment of my own contriving.
LILI: Might we watch, too?
BARON: Later, beloved... Now I wish only to be with you...
LILI: And I with you... I never dreamed life held such pleasures...
BARON: Pleasure is for those who seize it! Do you think those insipid, pale- skinned mortals will ever know such rapture?
LILI: It's odd... when I first found myself... changing... I was sick with loathing and disgust. I thought I was so ugly I wanted to die...
BARON: And, now?
LILI: Now I want to live forever. I've never felt so strong or happy.
BARON: Or looked so beautiful...
LILI: Yes. I feel that, too. Weakness is what is ugly.
BARON: Precisely, my darling. Your animal strength, your primitive power has surfaced... you are what you desire.
LILI: To be strong and free... that is all I desire.
BARON: So you shall be... Like our brothers, the hawk and the wolf, our spirits know no master... we are created in the pure image of the savage God that set our turbulent universe in motion.
