how the fuck do i start dating?
like. how do people even get started. yes i have tried expanding my social circle irl and online dating, but seem to be unable to even find interest in people. 
i get bored of people online really quickly and irl everyone seems to be just a passing fancy

when i interact with people, i’m very friendly and sociable. it just seems weird that i haven’t been able to have anyone interested in me. i know i’m not too bad in the looks area either (not model level but definitely up there)

i’m not scared of asking people out but i would like at least a small green flag before dropping the bomb on them (which i have not seen in anyone)

so, how do i start?
