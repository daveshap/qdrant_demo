messed up bootloader of windows 10 and ubuntu while dual booting windows 10 and ubuntu 18.04 I hope you guys are doing fine. So I tried to dual boot windows 10 and ubuntu 18.04. Windows 10 was already installed and I made a separate partition and tried to install ubuntu 18.04 on it. The installation was successful but now I have messed up with the bootloader. It says no bootable media found. I can neither boot into windows 10 nor into ubuntu. Accessing the driving through the ubuntu live cd. I have found that windows and ubuntu files are in their respective drives. So it is actually only the issue of bootloader. Checking the BIOS/UEFI setup, I have found that boot options only point to ubuntu but dont even boot into that. So how can fix this issue ? Will I have to reinstall the bootloader for windows ?
