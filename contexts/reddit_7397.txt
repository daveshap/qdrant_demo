Is a three-year gap-between getting a BA and starting a Masters too much?
I’m considering returning to academia to do a Masters, but I’m concerned three years away may leave me a bit rusty/not up to scratch. Have other people had this length of time out between their undergrad and postgrad studies? If so, how did they find it?
