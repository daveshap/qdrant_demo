EXLEY: Ray, you protected Ty and Larry up in Casitas, didn't you?
COATES: You ain't woofin' I did. Stupid down home niggers got no more sense than a fuckin' dog.
EXLEY: I heard you like to shoot dogs.
COATES: Dogs got no reason to live.
EXLEY: Oh? you feel that way about people, too?
COATES: Man, what're you saying?
EXLEY: Ray, we got the shotguns.
COATES: I don't own no shotguns.
EXLEY: Why were you throwing clothes in the building incinerator?
COATES: Say what?
EXLEY: You guys were arrested this morning, but none of you have last night's clothes. <u>You</u> were seen burning them. Add to that the fact that you hid the car you were cruising around in last night and it doesn't look good.
COATES: I got nothin' more to say till I see a judge.
EXLEY: Were you on hop? You were passed out when you got arrested. Were you hopped up, Ray?
COATES: Ty and Larry fuck with that shit, not me.
EXLEY: Where do they get their stuff? Come on. Give me one to feed the D.A. Just a little one.
