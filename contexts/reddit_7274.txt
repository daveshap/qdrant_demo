What field of study isn't difficult to get through that can yield a job that you won't necessarily hate yourself doing
I've found myself with the rare opportunity to be able to go to (back to) college in my mid 30s after spending over a decade in call center hell. 

I have no idea what I want to do. I've always been good with technology, but I get the vibe my market is oversaturated. 

I don't really have a passion for anything, so nothing internally to point me in a good direction. 

Guess the bottom line is that I'd like to learn something that won't turn out to be a waste of money that can result in a job I could be content with.
