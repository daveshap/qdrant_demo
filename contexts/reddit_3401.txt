I don’t know what men need to hear this, but Cockiness is acting like you own the place. Confidence is just acting like you’ve been there before.
I always see a lot of confusion around what the difference between cocky and confident is and this analogy is the best thing I can think of to really demonstrate it. 

If you’re at a club/bar and want to buy rounds for everyone as a flex, do it without announcing it. Act as though it’s something you just do. If you drive a nice car, don’t rev it up in the parking lot, and don’t even mention it until she asks about it, even after she sees it. 

If you bench a lot or dominate a sport, bring up only that you do it, then let her find out on her own from Instagram/whatever how impressive you are. 

You need to be jaded by your own special attributes because you’re always looking forward and on to becoming better, not constantly reflecting on yourself as if you’ve peaked.
