THE CAPTAIN: Right away. Will you have something, Mr. Thompson?
THOMPSON: I'll have a highball.
SUSAN: Who told you you could sit down here?
THOMPSON: Oh! I thought maybe we could have a drink together?
SUSAN: Think again!
SUSAN: Why don't you people let me alone? I'm minding my own business. You mind yours.
THOMPSON: If you'd just let me talk to you for a little while, Miss Alexander. All I want to ask you...
SUSAN: Get out of here! Get out! Get out!
