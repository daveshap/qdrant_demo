FRANK: Jack, you're on television.
JACK: Shut up, Frank.
EARL: What do you say we go for a walk, pal.
JACK: Get your hand off me.
EARL: Come on, friend. I can smell it on you. Get yourself a cup of coffee. You'll forget what you're angry about.
JACK: Go fuck yourself.
EARL: You're a real tough guy when the ladies are around, aren't you, Ace?
JACK: I don't see any ladies here. Except maybe you.
