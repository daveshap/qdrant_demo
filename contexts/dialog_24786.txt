CHEF: Hello there, children!!
STAN: Hey, Chef.
CHEF: How would like some Salisbury Steak with buttered noodles?
KYLE: We can't, we're on a hunger strike.
CHEF: A hunger strike? For what?
STAN: To free Terrance and Phillip.
CARTMAN: But you guys... It's Salisbury steak.
STAN: Chef, do you know anything about women?
CHEF: Ha! Is the Pope Catholic?
KYLE: I don't know.
CHEF: Children, I know ALL there is to know about women.
STAN: What's the secret to making a woman happy?
CHEF: Oh that's easy, you just gotta find the clitoris.
STAN: Huh?
CHEF: Oops, I guess you haven't got that far in your anatomy class, huh?
STAN: No, what does that mean, find the clitoris?
