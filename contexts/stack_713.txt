Is putting files in a HDD with NTFS which is part of a Windows system dangerous? I have two Windows systems. One of them is damaged and I'd like to copy the files from one system's HDD to another while I'm booted into an Ubunut Live CD. After that I'd like to reinstall Windows than put the saved files back on the HDD and delete the files from the other HDD and put the HDD back in the other machine with Windows.Can mounting the HDD with Windows system under Ubuntu and putting files on it damage the Windows system or the filesystem?
