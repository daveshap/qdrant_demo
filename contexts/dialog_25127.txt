KIRK: Midshipman, you're a tiger.
SCOTTY: My sister's youngest, Admiral. Crazy to get to space.
KIRK: Every young boy's fancy. I seem to remember it myself. Very well. Mr. Scott, are your engines capable of handling a minor training cruise?
SCOTTY: Give the word, Admiral.
KIRK: Mr. Scott, the word is given.
SCOTTY: Aye, sir.
BONES: What about the rest of the inspection, Admiral?
KIRK: The inspection will continue once we're underway, Doctor.
