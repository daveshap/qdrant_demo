BO CATLETT: Listen, Harry, how would you like to get your hands on five hundred grand? You pay me back at your convenience, no interest.
HARRY: You serious?
BO CATLETT: All I want in return is to work on the movie with you. Fact I already got some ideas on how to fix it up.
BO CATLETT: How 'bout another one for Mr. Zimm. A double.
HARRY: You're gonna just give me five hundred grand?
BO CATLETT: We'll talk about that, Harry. But first I gotta know, how'd you hook up with Chili Palmer.
MARTIN: Lemme talk to Buddy, set up a meeting.
CHILI: Buddy?
KAREN: Lufkin. His... agent.
MARTIN: Yeah, Karen knows him.
KAREN: But you are interested?
MARTIN: I'm intrigued, yeah. You know what might help you, take a look at the Cylone again, the way a visual fabric is maintained even while the metaphor plays on different levels. Hey â€“- This your ride, Chili?
MARTIN: Very nice...
CHILI: Yeah, I like it, I'm high up, I can see everything, you know? It's the Cadillac of minivans.
MARTIN: What's that?
CHILI: Compass.
MARTIN: Wow. Mind if I take it for a spin?
BO CATLETT: He was watching Letterman, huh? Sneaky, that Chili Palmer. So, he ever find this dry cleaner, the one with all that money on him?
HARRY: Leo, I don't know.
