client/server trust after authenticating over HTTPS then dropping to plaintext? DisclaimerIf this question is ridiculous it's because secure public key exchange sounds impossible before you learn about it. So I'm asking about things that may be impossible. QuestionIs it possible to drop a secure connection for plain text while maintaining a trusted connection. Meaning the server knows the player's requests are still his and the player knows game information is still the players.BackgroundI am writing some small JavaScript multiplayer games that will have authenticated users (Persistent user accounts across games). Since the server is resource limited on the computing side I would like to drop down to an unencrypted connection for game data. I am wondering if that is possible without opening myself up to very easy client or server spoofing attacks (JavaScript client).Main ConcernUser Trading in games seems particularly risky but is in development. Especially if I monetize a game linked to trading in the future. There may be enough incentive to fake a client sending valid but self damaging trades or spoof game information making misinformation scams possible. Additional InformationSince I already can't trust the client (as it's written in JavaScript) game state is always server side and clients can only send requests which are evaluated for validity.Some small games are already written and authentication is currently handled on the site which is running over https and is completely separate from the game servers. I'm in the process of bringing them together though no.Fun distributed solution?Although I don't have the resources, time or prerequisite knowledge to implement it, if trading was run through a series of DAPPS (On the ether block-chain) To my understanding all my concerns would be rectified at the expense of needing to spend real money on transactions.
