ZACK: I hear most of the girls who come to these things are looking for a husband.
PAULA: Not me.
ZACK: Yeah? Why're you here?
PAULA: To meet interesting people, improve myself. You wouldn't believe the losers we got over in Port Angeles.
ZACK: Do you go to school?
PAULA: No. I work for National Paper. It's a good job. I make eight-twenty-three an hour. When I get enough money saved, I plan to go on to college.
LYNETTE: You been through the Dilbert Dunker yet?
SID: Cake walk. Both my dad and my brother went through it and made it, so I know I can.
LYNETTE: Is your brother a flyer?
SID: He was. He died.
LYNETTE: Vietnam?
SID: Yeah.
LYNETTE: I had a big brother who died over there, too. He wasn't no flyer though. He was just your basic Marine Corps type. I was only twelve when it happened, so I don't remember much about him.
SID: I sure remember Tommy. Mind if we talked about something else?
LYNETTE: We don't have to talk at all.
