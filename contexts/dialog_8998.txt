CASTOR: Shoot him!
CASTOR: Just saving the tax-payers the cost of a trial. So take a hike.
BUZZ: What's the matter with your voice, Commander?
CASTOR: Castor Troy almost strangled me to death. Where the hell were you?
WANDA: You're both in custody until there's a DNA fingerprinting and we can prove who's who. Now put the gun down.
CASTOR: You can't blame me for trying.
