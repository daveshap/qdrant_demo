FATHER: You killed eight wedding guests in all!
LAUNCELOT: Er, Well ... the thing is ... I thought your son was a lady.
FATHER: I can understand that.
PRINCE: Hurry, brave Sir Launcelot!
FATHER: Shut up! You only killed the bride's father - that's all -
LAUNCELOT: Oh dear, I didn't really mean to...
FATHER: Didn't mean to? You put your sword right through his head!
LAUNCELOT: Gosh - Is he all right?
FATHER: You even kicked the bride in the chest! It's going to cost me a fortune!
LAUNCELOT: I can explain ... I was in the forest ... riding north from Camelot ... when I got this note.
FATHER: Camelot? Are you from Camelot?
PRINCE: Hurry!
LAUNCELOT: I am, sir. I am a Knight of King Arthur.
FATHER: 'Mm ... very nice castle, Camelot ... very good pig country....
LAUNCELOT: Is it?
FATHER: Do you want to come and have a drink?
LAUNCELOT: Oh ... that's awfully nice.
