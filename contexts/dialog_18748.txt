EVELYN: Then we'll have to find some immortal ones.
O'CONNELL: There goes that belief again. Not me, I am outta here!
EVELYN: According to that Book, once this creature has been reborn, his curse will spread, and as he grows in strength, so will his curse grow, infecting the people until the whole of the earth is destroyed.
O'CONNELL: Yeah? So? Is that my problem?
EVELYN: It's everybody's problem!
O'CONNELL: Look lady, I appreciate you saving my life and all, but when I signed on, I agreed to take you out there and bring you back, and I did, now were even, end of job, end of story, contract terminated.
EVELYN: That's what I am to you? A contract?
O'CONNELL: You can either tag along with me, or you can stay here and play around with Mister Maggot.
EVELYN: I'm staying.
O'CONNELL: FINE.
O'CONNELL: Beni ya little stinkweed, where did you slink off to?
BENI: You left me! You left me in the desert to rot.
O'CONNELL: Oh yeah,... sorry bout that. So who's this guy?
BENI: This is Prince Imhotep, High Priest of Osiris.
O'CONNELL: Oh, hey, how ya doin'?
BENI: The Prince does not like to be touched by other humans. A Silly eastern superstition, I'm afraid.
O'CONNELL: Yeah, well, we all got our little problems today don't we?
BENI: He has come to help Mister Burns. Somehow I feel responsible.
O'CONNELL: Don't gimme that, you never had any scruples.
BENI: Do you know where I can steal some?
