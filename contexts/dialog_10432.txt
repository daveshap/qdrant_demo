WASHINGTON: The only way to get discipline into these men is to beat it into them! Fifty lashes each!
NATHANAEL GREENE: Sir, Congress hasn't issued their pay for two months, many have not eaten properly for at least that long. You're being a little hard on them, don't you think?
WASHINGTON: Nathanael, someone bred to station, bred to being a gentleman -- unlike these men -- his sense of duty naturally prevails over the baser needs.
NATHANAEL GREENE: Well sir, I was an ironmaster before you got me. Maybe I will let you down yet.
WASHINGTON: I certainly didn't mean you. Of course you are a gentleman, an officer and a gentleman.
NATHANAEL GREENE: You wrong me, general; I am an officer and a horse-shoer.
WASHINGTON: How old are you, Captain?
HAMILTON: I'll be twenty next year, sir.
WASHINGTON: I'll expect you for dinner this evening, Captain Hamilton. For Christ's sake, have a bath.
HAMILTON: Delighted, sir.
