DENISE: Huh?
JERRY: Grab Mary and come inside.
DENISE: Come on sleeping beauty, time to go to work.
MARY: Sleeping.
DENISE: Rise and shine.
MARY: No please, let me sit this one out.
DENISE: Let's go. You're the one who wanted to be a photographer.
MARY: I resign.
DENISE: Too late. You're in for life, let's move it out Private Shutterbug.
MARY: Christ, I hope this isn't more crappy folk art. It's so quaint... it's so primal... it's so crap.
DENISE: Aw, it ain't crap... it's... cute. ...and really who are we to judge the artistic merit of the tin-can Mona Lisa?
MARY: Aw, shit... I gotta pee anyway.
