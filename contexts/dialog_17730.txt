CASTILLO: Yeah?
CROCKETT: Jos√© Yero changed-up the drop plan on us. He's grabbed Gina.
CASTILLO: Where's the new drop point...?
CROCKETT: They'll have surveillance on us. We'll know only at the last moment...
CASTILLO: What do you think?
CROCKETT: It's a rip and a hit.
CASTILLO: Get me Air Support... We'll be airborne and assault the ambush...
CROCKETT: You can't.
TUBBS: They'll kill Gina.
CASTILLO: They may have already, so we protect the living. Proof she's alive?
