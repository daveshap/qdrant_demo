Using Intersect to find where line crosses itself in ArcGIS Desktop? Can I not generate point features where a line feature intersects itself by using the Intersect tool? I try using it with just one line input but when I run it I get a warning saying the output generated is empty. There are visible intersections in the GPS data so it should produce some sort of output.I'm only using a basic license so unfortunately I can't use topology rules to find these intersections.
