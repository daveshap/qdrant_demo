Use an old iPhone 6 just for audiobooks - Cannot transfer file from iTunes to iPhone I have an iPhone 6 that I want to use for one purpose: listen to audiobooks. When I connect the iPhone to iTunes on my PC, I can see the iPhone. But when I try to drag-and-drop an audiobook onto the phone, nothing happens (not even a \"prohibited\") warning.The iTunes version is current (12.8). iTunes is set for manual synching. The iPhone has enough space for an audiobook or books.The iPhone does not have a SIM card.What can I do to transfer an audiobook file to the iPhone?
