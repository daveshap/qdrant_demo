HARRY: A Mister Quaid?
TOFFLER: Right. And he's dead, isn't he? I saw it on the news. Jennifer doesn't know. And frankly, this isn't the best tine for her to be told.
HARRY: I won't say anything.
TOFFLER: Jennifer's been with us four years. She was coming on nicely. But just the last month or so, she's worse than ever.
HARRY: What's her problem?
TOFFLER: She has no real grip on reality.

HARRY: And what does Jennifer think's real?
