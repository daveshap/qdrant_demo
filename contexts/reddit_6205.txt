Do I tell my references not to mention the most recent job I had quit?
Hi Reddit,

So I feel like I’m in a pickle right now. This September, I had worked at a company (my first job) for only a week. I left that quickly because I had an incredibly toxic boss (who got fired later... karma lol) and overall I did not see myself thriving in that position. I updated my references (who I had used for that job) about my quitting and the fact that I’m back in the job search.

So last week, I got an offer for my dream job at a different company. I supplied my employer with the same list of references I had used for my previous job. I’ve basically cleared everything in the onboarding process besides the reference check (because all of my references were out of office during the break). The more I wait for the reference check to complete, the more anxious I get about them mentioning my first job (for some random reason)...  I omitted that position from my resume/application and basically told my interviewers that I’ve been searching for jobs and finding myself blah blah blah since I’ve graduated.

So ultimately, my question is, should I ask my references not to mention my previous job during the reference check? If so, how can I phrase it? Thanks so much! I feel like I’m being anxious for no reason and I just need some reassurance.
