I have been offered a position that would be the equivical to the US Presidents "body man." How do I figure out what my on-call downtime and travel time is worth. The offer is generous for 40 hours, but I want to be fair to myself for being always available.
Been offered a job and need help figuring out different parts of compensation. Please and thank you.

* Available at employers whim. I will need to make my schedule his schedule, even when they do personal errands and somedays being available without much if any notice. Basically I will give up my life for a year to a year and a half because of this position. He can't afford to give up a year while he develops more business opportunities in his family's company and deals with some big franchises that have approached and what his family currently has going on, which is substantial.
* There will be a lot of downtime while I travel for days with them.
* I am being paid to be available, discrete, professional and reliable. I will also use my degree, industry knowledge, life experience and sound advice. He knows I can do it because I recently worked for his family in a much different capacity but as he said, they were very impressed how I demonstrated these things. He would use me as a personal assistant for those skills. But the most important duty is to be able to drive him where he needs to go, which is almost daily for work in a large region. I would learn a lot on how his organization operates but after a year to a year and a half there is no guarentee of a position or expectation of a position with this organization.
*  He has offered a salary but it doesn't seem to cover all the on-call time or the 3 or 4 days I will need to travel with him out of town. 
*  I will be paid by him and not his family's organization right now becaise he is trying to keep his circumstances quiet to others in his organization.  At certain times when he meets with people I will need to stay out of site or in the deep background because of what their perceptions of this situation might be.
* I will be given a housing allowance that would pay for a place I could live or about 60 to 70 percent of a great place to live. I am having to move an hour away to where he lives. And despite the move, the move isn't an inconvenience.
* I will have very few expenses when in his company. And because his family owns two different restaurant groups, I could eat for free all throughout this region even when I'm not in his company. Basically a credit card to use at those 16 locations. Not bad food but I wouldn't eat there all the time because I like to go out and eat and cook as well.
* I will probably save about half of what I make when this if through, and that would include being debt free except a student loan but aggressively paying it off. But I am worried I will get extremely bored quickly and in a year be out of a job and have another year short of starting a career.
* How do I figure out what my time is worth beyond 40 hours and although there is downtime, I'm still on call. What is that time worth?
