Recommendation for books about how to be academically successful.
I have a Master’s in higher ed, but my knowledge is lacking in terms of how to help students who aren’t getting good grades. The population that I primarily work with is international students, but would be open to finding out about books about academic success for all/any student. I am looking for books that are written for student affairs staff who try to help students who need additional help in academic success. 
I have some of my own “hunches” of course on how to motivate, help them develop study skills, etc., but still need some more feedback/tools for being more effective. 
Thanks in advance!
