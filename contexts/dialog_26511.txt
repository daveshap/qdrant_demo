LUTHOR: You'll be designing monuments soon, Albert! Hotels! Palaces!
ALBERT: Bunkers!
LUTHOR: I take the man out of Argentina - and it was no picnic finding him y'know? And what does he think about? Bunkers. Still living in the past, when I am about to realize the greatest real estate scheme in the history of the world!
EVE: You and your real estate.
LUTHOR: Me and my real estate? How many other girls, Miss Teschmacher, are lucky enough to have a Park Avenue address like this?
EVE: It isn't a Park Avenue address. really.
LUTHOR: So it's six hundred feet below Park Avenue, It's still a Park Avenue address.
