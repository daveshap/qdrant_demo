DOROTHY: Wonderful! Why, if our Scarecrow back in Kansas could do that, the crows'd be scared to pieces!
SCARECROW: They would?
DOROTHY: Um-hmm.
SCARECROW: Where's Kansas?
DOROTHY: That's where I live. And I want to get back there so badly I'm going all the way to Emerald City to get the Wizard of Oz to help me.
SCARECROW: You're going to see a Wizard?
DOROTHY: Um-hmm.
SCARECROW: Do you think if I went with you this Wizard would give me some brains?
DOROTHY: I couldn't say. But even if he didn't, you'd be no worse off than you are now.
SCARECROW: Yes -- that's true.
DOROTHY: But maybe you'd better not. I've got a witch mad at me, and you might get into trouble.
SCARECROW: Witch? Huh! I'm not afraid of a witch! I'm not afraid of anything --- except a lighted match.
DOROTHY: I don't blame you for that.
SCARECROW: But I'd face a whole box full of them for the chance of getting some brains. Look -- I won't be any trouble, because I don't eat a thing -- and I won't try to manage things, because I can't think. Won't you take me with you?
