Put on performance improvement plan, did EVERYTHING outlined but was still fired.
Have never been in trouble at any job, however had a big dissagreement with a superior and all.of the sudden I magically was put on a performance improvement plan. I was told my customers did not like me (I am a district manager and oversee 30 stores inside automobile dealerships) I was told i could get training if needed. So knowing what was going on I dived into my job like never before, i even made a form for my customers to sign if they were completely satisfied at the end of my visits (Every last one signed it). I asked for training a couple times to help me learn whatever it was they said I wasnt doing, and they never came to the table to do it. The day of my "re evaluation" came and passed and I was happy at first then worried. I texted my immediate supervisor to see  how i was doing and what was going on with the re evaluation and he said let me check, they called me at 5 on a that same day and let me go. Do I have any recourse? Sorry for the long winded story.
