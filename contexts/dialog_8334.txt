MAC: We're working.
GIN: It's a party.
MAC: Let's mingle a little, shall we?
MAC: I said a masked ball, not a costume party.
THIBADEAUX: How the hell I'm supposed to know the damn difference?
MAC: You look like George Washington.
THIBADEAUX: I cannot tell you a goddamned lie. She's selling you a pig in a poke. We better do this tonight.
MAC: It's too soon.
THIBADEAUX: The early bird gets the damn worm.
MAC: But the second mouse gets the cheese.
MAC: So patience, Thibeau, patience. Trust me.
THIBADEAUX: Remind me why.
MAC: Because it pays off.

THIBADEAUX: You change partners, you change the rules.
