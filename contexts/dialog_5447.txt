CAPTAIN GOD: I'm not going to worry about it. We are quite beyond the computer disc. Everything will be over within the next hour or so.
ADONIS: Yew'll be ovah in the naxt tehn minutes...
CAPTAIN GOD: Adonis, be polite. She's a friend.
CATWOMAN: How can you say things with such feeling and then turn around and put on a helmet and...Who are you? Were you sitting on my right or my left at the card table? Tell me! Please tell me who you are; you own me that!
CAPTAIN GOD: I know, I should probably tell you, but I just don't feel like it. To be honest, I'm really angry at you. I admired you so much more when you were purely wicked. I mean, look at you now, running around trying to get to the bottom" of things. Trying to "save the city." It's true we're about to do a very nasty deed
ADONIS: You know, nobody likes you...
CACTUS: Yeah, all those women who went feline this afternoon...They're so ashamed now..
CATWOMAN: I'm supposed to be taking personality tips from you three? You people were once heroes. You had ideals. You fought for things. Spooky told me so...
CAPTAIN GOD: Do you have any idea how much superheroes get paid? Zilcho. Urban vigilantes with secret identities operating outside the law. Not exactly the stuff of a W-2 form. If it wasn't for merchandising and corruption and these diabolical missions"...There is no such thing as heroes and villains
CACTUS: Car wash, Captain?
CAPTAIN GOD: Absolutely.
