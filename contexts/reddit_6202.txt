Working at a big bank, was hired to one team but HR called and said I was moved to another. The new team is pretty out of alignment with my skills and interests, should I talk to my manager?
Some context, I just graduated from a master's program in CS and originally interviewed for this job a few months ago.

So I was hired a few months ago to a big bank as a new hire. I interviewed with a manager and his department seemed really interesting and in line with my previous internships and school. I accepted the offer but a month before starting HR called telling me I'd been moved to a different department that they thought would be a better fit based on my skills.

I spoke with the new manager and it seemed alright, but it's been a week after starting and it's extremely clear the new team is just overworked and needed more people, and the job seems to be maintaining legacy systems even after I graduated with a master's degree, while the old team was working on some more modern stuff that was really in line with my skills.

So my question is, should I bring this up with my new boss even though I've already been here two weeks? How would you bring this up? I'm trying to figure out whether to talk to my current manager, the manager I was originally hired to, or HR. Any advice in general though would be appreciated, thanks in advance!
