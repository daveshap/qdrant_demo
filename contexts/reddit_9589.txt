Clemson M.Ed. in Student Affairs
Hi all, 

I was hired in November at Clemson University in an advising job that I really like. After a year of work, I have the opportunity to take 6 credits/semester for free, so I am considering an M.Ed. in Student Affairs here. A couple questions: 

* Does it seem like a good idea to get an M.Ed. at all if I already have a first job in Student Affairs? 
* Does anyone have any thoughts about the Clemson M.Ed? 
* Does it generally have a good reputation in the field? What if I am looking to take a job outside of the Southeast? 

Thanks for your time and help!
