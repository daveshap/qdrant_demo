NORMA: The wind gets in that blasted pipe organ. I ought to have it taken out.
GILLIS: Or teach it a better tune.
NORMA: How long is a movie script these days? I mean, how many pages?
GILLIS: Depends on what it is -- a Donald Duck or Joan or Arc.
NORMA: This is to be a very important picture. I have written it myself. Took me years.
GILLIS: Looks like enough for six impor- tant pictures.
NORMA: It's the story or Salome. I think I'll have DeMille direct it.
GILLIS: Uh-huh.
NORMA: We've made a lot of pictures together.
GILLIS: And you'll play Salome?
NORMA: Who else ?
GILLIS: Only asking. I did't know you were planning a comeback.
NORMA: I hate that word. It is a return. A return to the millions of people who have never forgiven me for deserting the screen.
GILLIS: Fair enough.
NORMA: Salome -- what a woman! What a part! The Princess in love with a Holy man. She dances the Dance of the Seven Veils. He rejects her, so she demands his head on a golden tray, kissing his cold, dead lips.
GILLIS: They'll love it in Pomona.
NORMA: They will love it every place. Read it. Read the scene just before she has him killed!
GILLIS: Right now? Never let another writer read your stuff. He may steal it.
NORMA: I am not afraid. Read it!
