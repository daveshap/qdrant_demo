MICKEY: Mmm, I don't know if you remember me, but we had the worst night of my life together.
HOLLY: I remember you.
MICKEY: Yes, you do recall, right?
HOLLY: I recall you.
MICKEY: I was walking past and I saw you in here...
HOLLY: Yeah.
MICKEY: ...and I thought I'd come in and...and we could replay, uh, the whole, uh...
HOLLY: We didn't hit it off.
MICKEY: Oh, that's putting it mildly. We did everything but exchange gunshots.
HOLLY: How are you?
MICKEY: Good. How are you?
HOLLY: I'm fine.
MICKEY: You look wonderful.
HOLLY: Oh, no.
MICKEY: Yeah, really. You do. You do.
HOLLY: Yeah?
MICKEY: It was a terrible evening.
HOLLY: Yeah, it was.
MICKEY: Remember slamming the cab door in my face and.. you know, it came very dangerously close to emasculating my nose in a...
HOLLY: I'd never do that.
MICKEY: ...in a really horrible way.
HOLLY: Oh, well, that was a long time ago.
MICKEY: You look wonderful. You do. What happened to you?
HOLLY: People change...you know.
MICKEY: Well, I hope you've changed.
HOLLY: Yeah, I hope you have, too. MICKEY I hope so for your sake, because, uh, your personality left something to be desired...
HOLLY: Yeah, and for yours. I'm sure you've changed.
MICKEY: ...namely a personality.
MICKEY: So how are you?
HOLLY: I'm okay.
MICKEY: You didn't answer my question. What are you doing?
HOLLY: Oh, nothing much. You know...
MICKEY: Well...
HOLLY: ...just some stuff. A little of this, a little of that, that's all.
MICKEY: Yeah? Is that an embarrassing question? Should I have not asked it?
HOLLY: Probably not.
MICKEY: Are you, are you out of work or something?
HOLLY: No, well...I've been trying to write.
MICKEY: Have you?
HOLLY: Yeah.
MICKEY: Well, that's interesting. Wh-what kind of stuff?
HOLLY: Oh...well, you-you're not interested in this.
MICKEY: No, you can tell me.
HOLLY: Come on.
MICKEY: No, I am. I am.
HOLLY: Oh, no, millions of people come up to you and say, Hey
MICKEY: Nobody ever said it.
HOLLY: Really?
MICKEY: This is it. Yeah. This is really-- HOLLY Well, wo-would you be willing to-to read it? Something...that I wrote?
MICKEY: Well, yes, I would if, uh, if it would mean anything to you. I don't know why it would.
HOLLY: No, the reason I ask is--
MICKEY: You've always hated my taste in the past.
HOLLY: No, I haven't.
MICKEY: You have.
HOLLY: I haven't. No, the reason why I ask is I think it might make a great, uh, television script, and, you know, you're so active in television, so--
MICKEY: I'm not anymore. I haven't, I haven't been in television for a year.
HOLLY: You're kidding me.
MICKEY: I've done no television whatsoever. No.
MICKEY: I may, I may have to get back into it, 'cause my accountant says that I'm running out of dollars. But...but, um, no, I haven't, I just sort of dropped out for a year...
HOLLY: Oh. Oh.
MICKEY: ...which is a long, dull story and I won't get into it. But--
HOLLY: You're okay, though, huh?
MICKEY: I'm-- Yes. Yes, I'm fine. I'm fine. How are you?
HOLLY: Oh, I'm fine.
MICKEY: What...what about your script? So what's it about?
HOLLY: Well, I'd love it if you'd read it, actually, 'cause I really would value your opinion.
MICKEY: You have to remember, we-we-we didn't agree on one thing.
HOLLY: But you have to remember while you're reading and you're cursing my name, you know, that this is my first script. Well, it's not my first script.
MICKEY: Hmm.
HOLLY: Actually, my first script was about Hannah and her husband, but, uh...
MICKEY: Yeah.
HOLLY: ...Hannah read it, she got really angry, and... you know, then I felt badly, so I--
MICKEY: Oh, well, God, I can imagine what you wrote.
HOLLY: Oh, no! It wasn't anything bad. But she just... you know. I don't know.
MICKEY: Really?
HOLLY: So, uh...I threw it out, but I have this other one.
MICKEY: Well, you know, I-I-I...you know, if you want me to, I'll read it.
HOLLY: Oh, gosh, I don't know. Well, could I come over tomorrow and read it to you?
MICKEY: Come over tomorrow and read it to me?
MICKEY: You must be joking. I've been doing all my own reading since I was forty...you know.
HOLLY: Hmm. I think it's lucky I ran into you. Maybe.
MICKEY: Well, what about me?
HOLLY: Oh, well.
MICKEY: I should have kept going. I-I have a sneaking feeling, a nagging sensation I should've kept walking and...
