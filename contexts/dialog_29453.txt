SHERIDAN: Salazar's been taken down. He was working for Porfirio Madrigal.
ROBERT: What? I thought Madrigal was dead. I thought it was verified.
SHERIDAN: Apparently not. Look, it's a shit storm here right now. When are you coming back? I don't know what to tell people any more.
ROBERT: I'll get there as soon as I can.
SHERIDAN: If we're moving the press conference, we need to do it now. Are you all right?
