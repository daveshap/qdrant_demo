With Theresa May resigning, how does succession to her position work?
Theresa May announced today [that she is resigning as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-48395905)

She has said her resignation will be effective as of June 7, 2019, [edit: this is her resignation as leader of the Conservative party, not necessarily as PM] and that the Conservative party would pick a new leader by July.  That leader would be head of the party with [the most, but not a majority](https://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/mps/current-state-of-the-parties/) of seats in Parliament.

* Who would be Prime Minister during the period after her resignation and before the new leader is picked?

* What is the procedure for picking the new leader of the Conservative party, and therefore impliedly the new Prime Minister?

* Would the new Prime Minister need to survive an affirmative confidence vote like a [throne speech?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_from_the_throne)  Or would they merely need to avoid failing a specific nonconfidence vote?
