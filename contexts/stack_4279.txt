How close could a planet get to a super massive black hole before being destroyed I wanted to create a scene where two god-like characters are talking or fighting on a planet or fragment of planet to which they've teleported that's about to be obliterated by a black hole.The characters are effectively gods so heat and gravity won't affect them too much. I wanted the black hole and stars being engulfed to fill the sky.At what distance could a planet still have some surface to stand on as it orbits the black hole before turning completely into dust?
