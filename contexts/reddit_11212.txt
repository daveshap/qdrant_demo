We know it's not much, but if anyone could use a little help, or simply a good sandwich, we're trying to help as many people as possible during the holidays.
We've been trying to help as many people as possible over the past 3-4 days, and today we'd like to help even more.

It's not much, but we're trying to do something fun and positive for the holidays, everyone could use a little help or cheering up from time to time, we're trying to make people's days a bit better, whether they could use a little extra help or simply a good meal. If you know anyone who could use a bit of help during the holidays, post here or take a look at what we've been doing so far.

If you or anyone you know could use a little extra help during the holidays please let us know, or take a look at what we've been doing so far...
