HEATHER DUKE: Where did you get these?
J.D.: Oh, I just had the <u>nicest</u> chat with Ms. Dumptruck. Got along famously! It's scary how everyone's got a story to tell....Would you care to see the canoeing shots?

HEATHER DUKE: But she couldn't handle it.
J.D.: I think you can. In Catcher in the Rye Holden says his ideal job'd be making sure some kids don't fall off a cliff. He doesn't realize if you pay too much attention to the kids, you'll back off the cliff yourself.
HEATHER DUKE: Very very. The photographs?
J.D.: Don't worry. I'll ask you to do me a favor. You'll get the negatives and everything back then.
