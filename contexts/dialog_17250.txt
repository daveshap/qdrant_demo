HAWKEYE: Please! Face it, Colonel, you don't have us, we have you. Your boys blew this case, we bailed you out. We figure we ought to hang around a day to check the Congressman's kid, and we also figure to play some golf. So if that's okay with you, we got a deal.
TRAPPER: And if it isn't, why don't we call Washington on your telephone? You tell your story, we'll tell ours.
HAWKEYE: When you make up your mind, get in touch. The golf club is probably the best place to leave a message.
