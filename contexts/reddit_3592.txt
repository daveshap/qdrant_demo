Why do guys just ask for sex on tinder :
1- some girls say yes

2- why would you invest time and energy in a stranger from the online where there is so much abundance? Women follow the same logic on OLD btw. 

3- small talking gets you ghosted most of the time

4- being polite but straightforward and ask for a date gets you ghosted most of the time

5- Basically anything gets you ghosted most of the time anyways. 

Here is the thing. Most girls don't use tinder to meet guys (tinder official stats, not me making that up). So guys invest less and less and less energy into trying to talk. 

Who's left behind? Those who genuinely want to meet someone and go through trying to know others. 

It's a downward spiral. ❤️
