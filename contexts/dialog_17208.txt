MRS. PILLETTI: That was a nice girl last night, Marty. She wasn't a very good-looking girl, but she looks like a nice girl. I said, she wasn't a very good-looking girl... not very pretty...
MARTY: I heard you, Ma.
MRS. PILLETTI: She looks a little old for you. About thirty-five, forty years old?
MARTY: She's twenty-nine, Ma.
MRS. PILLETTI: She's more than twenty-nine years old, Marty. That's what she tells you.
MARTY: What, Ma?
MRS. PILLETTI: She looks thirty-five, forty. She didn't look Italian to me.
MRS. PILLETTI: I said, is she Italian girl?
MARTY: I don't know. I don't think so.
