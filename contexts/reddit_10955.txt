I don't think the SW Mods can be thanked enough.
The mods on here that read these posts tirelessly and answer PMs and pretty much just provide an ear to hear your story and do it all in complete anonymity are true fucking heroes not only among reddit but among humanity as a whole.

Massive kudos to you all.
