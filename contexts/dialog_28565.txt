KALEN: And everyone looks like us?
ALEXANDER: Exactly like you. Well, maybe not as healthy.

ALEXANDER: Some. But I mean we aren't all so... handsome.
KALEN: I want to see your home. Will you take me?
MARA: Kalen, right now you need to go up to bed. You're exhausting Alexander.
KALEN: You'll tell me more tomorrow?
