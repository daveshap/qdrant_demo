FLETCH: I haven't seen you since the wedding, Jeez, you look great.
MRS. STANWYK: I do? Oh, isn't that sweet, thank you. I have to confess something to you. I must have been pretty plowed at your wedding. I really don't have the faintest idea who you are.
FLETCH: Huh? No, not my wedding. Yours.
MRS. STANWYK: Oh, mine! Thank God. Actually, that doesn't make it any better, does it? Are you a friend of Alan's?
FLETCH: We used to fly together. I'm... John.
MRS. STANWYK: John! You used to fly together!
MRS. STANWYK: John who?
FLETCH: John Ultrarelamensky.
MRS. STANWYK: Oh, I'm sorry. It's a beautiful name, really.
FLETCH: It's Scotch-Rumanian.
MRS. STANWYK: That's a strange combination.
FLETCH: So were my parents.
MRS. STANWYK: Mind if I keep practicing? I need to work on my ground stroke a little.
FLETCH: Please.
WAITER: Excuse me sir. Are you a guest of the club?
FLETCH: Yes, I'm with the Underhills.
WAITER: They just left, sir.
FLETCH: They'll be back. He had to go in for a urinalysis.
WAITER: Would you care for a drink while you're waiting? I can put it on the Underhill bill.
FLETCH: Great. I'll have a Bloody Mary and a steak sandwich.
WAITER: Very good sir.
MRS. STANWYK: Damn, I thought I had that one.
FLETCH: You should play with much larger tennis balls. So how's Alan?
MRS. STANWYK: What are you asking me for? He's so busy lately I hardly see him. And he's been so preoccupied.
FLETCH: Preoccupied with what?
MRS. STANWYK: Oh, personal stuff. Look! I hit one!
