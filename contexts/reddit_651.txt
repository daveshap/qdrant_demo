Confused
Im 22 and there was a female who we were little more than fwb, there were mutual feelings but never acted upon them. Now after basically ghosting me for several months she messages me sending signals like before, slightly flirting. I offer to come smoke her out but she says "im kinda seeing someone, i think we should match from now on". Im so confused like why add me back flirting just to say. There is no way her and me could just me friends. Not sure how to approach the situation. I just "aight just lmk wassup". Not sure what else to say.
