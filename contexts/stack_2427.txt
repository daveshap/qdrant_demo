Creating raster from selection of footprints in Mosaic Dataset? I am working with thousands of DEM tiles, so I have put them into a Mosaic Dataset. (Please give me feedback if this is not the best way to handle this amount of data).I was given DEM tiles that extend beyond the area of interest, so I did a Select by Location in order to choose the footprints that fall within the area of a particular polygon.I have tried right clicking the \"Image\" title in the Mosaic Dataset and choosing Export data (with Selected Footprints). This returned a raster with all of the rasters in the Dataset.EDITI have tried Exporting the data from the Mosaic Dataset twice. Once using a Mask and again using Extents (all in Geoprocessing Environments). For both I used a polygon I created. Yet the output is still the full raster.Background geoprocessing is turned off, so I can't figure out what is going wrong so far.How do I go about creating a raster from of the area of interest?
