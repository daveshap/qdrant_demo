VERBAL: I was out of line.
KEATON: You okay?
VERBAL: I'11 be alright.
KEATON: Well, I'm sorry.
VERBAL: Forget it. I'11 probably shit blood tonight.
KEATON: How are they going to do it?
VERBAL: McManus wants to go in shooting. I said no way.
KEATON: Fenster and Hockney?
VERBAL: They're pretty pissed off. They'll do anything. Now I got a way to do it without killing anyone: but like I said, they won't let me in without you.
KEATON: Three million?
VERBAL: Maybe more.
KEATON: No killing?
VERBAL: Not if we do it my way.
