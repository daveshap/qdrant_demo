JAKE: Are you Niki?
NIKI: Sure. Like in Mikey and Niki. Did you see that picture?
JAKE: No.
NIKI: Too bad. I wasn't in it.
NIKI: It's your money. You talk.
JAKE: I'm making a film. Jim Sullivan's going to be in it. He said you might know where Tod is.
NIKI: Do I know you? Weren't you on the set the other night? With Ramada.
JAKE: Yeah.
NIKI: You making a feature?
JAKE: Um-hm. Live sound.
NIKI: Got any parts? I'm free. Not free- free, but, you know, free. I don't really do this.
