SUE: He's working round the clock. But the data needs to be tested, analyzed before --
VICTOR: Same old Reed. All analysis, no action. Wasn't that the problem with you two?
SUE: If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us <u>worse</u>, maybe even kill us.
VICTOR: Then why is Reed dragging his feet? Maybe he <u>likes</u> having his prize specimen under glass... It's ironic, isn't it? You're finally the perfect woman for him...because you're his <u>science project</u>.
SUE: Please don't make this personal --
VICTOR: Oh, I think you already have.
SUE: Victor, we <u>can't do anything</u> until the research is ready.
