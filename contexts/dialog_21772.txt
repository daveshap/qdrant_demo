JOEY: What're you doin' with Salvy? You shouldn't be here with him. Jake's away killin' himself. Suppose he found out.
VICKIE: What the hell am I doing wrong? Just because Jake is training, I can't go out? What am I, a goddamn prisoner?
JOEY: No, you're his wife.
VICKIE: I'm not doing anything wrong. I'm just trying to have a good time. Do I have to be cooped up in the house all the time?
JOEY: It don't look right.
VICKIE: Well, go ahead, tell Jake. He's gonna kill me anyway. It's a matter of time.
JOEY: I'm not gonna tell him nothing; but if he finds out, he will kill you. What's the matter with you? Aren't you happy? You got everything you want.
VICKIE: You don't sleep with him. I do. I don't get to breathe without tellin' him. He keeps me in a cage. If he thinks I'm lookin' at somebody the wrong way, I get used as a punching bag. He don't trust nobody. If he saw the two of us talking together right now, you'd be in trouble too -- believe me. Look at me, Joey. I'm 19 years old. I wanna enjoy my life. I love Jake, but you don't know. He gets crazy sometimes. I'm scared.
JOEY: Try to understand, Vickie. Jake's got a lotta aggravation. He's been a top contender too long.
VICKIE: That's right, take his part. You're his brother. He's never gonna be champ. Too many people are against him.
JOEY: And you're drinking with them right now.
VICKIE: And I'm gonna finish my drink. And, I'm gonna have a good time, because I ain't doing nothing wrong.
