MARY: My father was a great man, you know. There was nobody he wouldn't help. You know that crazy guy Noel who I gave water to last night? He lived in our house for almost a year. A total stranger he'd do anything for, his own family though ...
FRANK: It's best not to ... It's good pizza, huh?
MARY: Not as good as Nino's.
FRANK: You remember that pizza place, Joe's on Tenth Street maybe fifteen years ago? When you ordered a pie it came with a little plastic madonna in the middle?
MARY: Yeah, or Saint Anthony. You from the neighborhood?
FRANK: I grew up on Elizabeth. I went to Blessed Sacrament.
MARY: On yeah? I went to Holy Name. Where'd you go to high school?
FRANK: We moved out after that. Upstate.
MARY: Like everybody else--except us. Always standing on the sidewalk waving goodbye to moving trucks. Your parents ... ?
FRANK: They're fine. My old man was a bus driver, mom a nurse--I was sort of born to it, I guess.
MARY: You married?
FRANK: Ah, no. I was. It's hard to explain. She had a hard time adjusting to, well, maybe it was my fault too.
