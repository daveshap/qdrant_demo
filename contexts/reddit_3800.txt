Why are men "required" to be the first ones to message , and "must" be original ?
Im all up for a cheesy but funny pickup line or the nice Icebreaker question but goddamn if all you have on your profile is your name and your photo , what am I supposed to say except the very simple and straightforward " hey , how's your day been?" 

Maybe Im just looking at this wrong , would like to know what you fellows think.

Edit : I'm looking at this from a long term relationship view , hookups and the such aren't my goal and so I usually try to avoid girls who are interested in just that .
