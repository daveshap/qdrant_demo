Dealing with old friends and loss
I dont really know what to say about this it's very fresh

About a decade ago my friends group began to break down and fall apart 

The four of us were very close me my best friend and his twin cousins that home was as close to mine as theirs for most of my teens until it wasnt

Long story short they started getting pretty far into drugs and all of us were dealing with worsening mental illness a few deaths in our families and the relationship declined pretty rapidly

After 10 years of introspection and a lot of hard work I'm married and a very different person than I was I still keep up with my yearly voyueristic look into what's going on with them tho

And I was blindsided with a news report from about a year ago of my ex? Best friend having beaten one of the cousins to death with a copper pipe over an argument

This at first was just a confusing event to me like I was reading about it with no relation to the people involved then it started to feel surreal 

I found out halfway home on the bus and by the time we got a few stops in I was in a full breakdown sobbing 

He looks like a ghost of the person I used to know in the mug shot

He was the smartest person I've ever had the pleasure of knowing, engaged and excited to talk about everything and anything

He also murdered one of the most outstanding likeable people I've ever met and left his twin brother alone for the rest of his life

I'm an insane mixture of grief confusion and anger at people I havent talked to in so so long

he's been in a mental facility for the better part of the last year and from the ongoing proceedings their is a decent chance hell end up there as incompetent to hold trial let alone go to jail for what he did so I dont know that the person I knew has been there for a while

I dont mind posting the news report if you're curious ill respond as long as I can today this has taken a lot out of me 

My wife thinks i should probably go to therapy to talk about this but it just seems foolish with how estranged we are at this point
