BISHOP: That's it. See it? Emergency venting.
RIPLEY: How long until it blows?
BISHOP: I'm projecting total systems failure in a little under four hours. The blast radius will be about thirty kilometers. About equal to ten megatons.
HICKS: We got problems.
HUDSON: I don't fucking believe this. Do you believe this?
RIPLEY: And it's too late to shut it down?
BISHOP: I'm afraid so. The crash did too much damage. The overload is inevitable, at this point.
HUDSON: Oh, man. And I was gettin' short, too! Four more weeks and out. Now I'm gonna buy it on this fuckin' rock. It ain't half fair, man!
VASQUEZ: Hudson, give us a break.
RIPLEY: We need the other drop-ship. The on one the Sulaco. We have to bring it down on remote, somehow.
HUDSON: How? The transmitter was on the APC. It's wasted.
RIPLEY: I don't care how! Think of a way. Think of something.
HUDSON: Think of what? We're fucked.
RIPLEY: What about the colony transmitter? That up-link tower down at the other end. Why can't we use that?
