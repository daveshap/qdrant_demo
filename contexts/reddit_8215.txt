What is birthright citizenship, what are the pros and cons to birthright citizenship, and what would the constitutionality be for an executive order to end birthright citizenship? (More in text)
Recently, President Trump announced that he would sign an executive order ending birthright citizenship (https://www.axios.com/trump-birthright-citizenship-executive-order-0cf4285a-16c6-48f2-a933-bd71fd72ea82.html)

Trump says that the purpose of the executive order is to end the practice of anchor babies: babies who are born on US soil to non-US citizens/illegal aliens but are US citizens because they were born inside the US. (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchor_baby)

Opponents argue that the executive order would violate the Section 1 of 14th Amendment of the United States, which states that "All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws." (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution).

So here are my questions:

1. What is Birthright citizenship?

2. What are the pros and cons to birthright citizenship?

2b. What does the 14th Amendment say/the Supreme Court ruled in regards to birthright citizenship or children born by non-US citizens?

3. What would be the constitutionality (What is consitutional/unconstitutional) to a law or executive order ending birthright citizenship?

3b. Does the President have the authority to make such a decision?
