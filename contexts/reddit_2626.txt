I’m not very good at my job, and I’m failing. How do I get out with my reputation intact?
So basically I’m working as a social media manager, one day a week. I was hired because I’ve successfully managed a very large group that contained the brands target audience. I also successfully manage the page of a personal project of mine, and was part of Facebook’s community leaders programme. 

I had been working previously in politics in a communications role after graduating in 2018. The politics contract was very high level but it was only to cover a maternity leave, but it was a great opportunity at my stage in my career and I came out of it with my reputation enhanced. It was not a social media job, and was mainly geared towards traditional media.

I’m hoping to get back into the world of politics and communications full time, but in the meantime I was offered to take on this job. I wanted to make sure my CV didn’t lie empty in between jobs, the extra cash was of course appreciated and thought I’d be good at it. I thought wrong. 

I can’t stand my boss, I think the brand I’m working for is toxic, for example we were forced to turn off reviews. But anyway I’m three months in and realise that the Coronavirus has wrecked profits for the brand, and my social media posts aren’t reaching acceptable levels. We have a following of around 5000, and the reach of our posts is around 180. 

The money I get paid isn’t very much, but I’m afraid that I’ll get sacked, or I’ll quit and it’ll put off future employers. I don’t think the agency I’m working for would provide glowing references. 

So basically do I quit or hold out? Wipe it off my CV and just not mention it, or just leave it up and hope for the best? It’s been a big misstep and I wish I hadn’t done it.
