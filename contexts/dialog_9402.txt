GONZO: No! I can't get out! They'll crucify me. I'll have to take the blame!
DUKE: Ridiculous! Just say you were hitchhiking to the airport and I picked you up. You never saw me before. Shit, this town is full of white Cadillac convertibles. I plan to go through there so fast that nobody will even glimpse the goddamn license plate. You ready?
GONZO: Why not? But for Christ's sake, just do it fast!
