HOLLY: Wow, I guess I hit a nerve.
HANNAH: You make it sound like, you know, I have no needs or something. You think I'm too self-sufficient?
HOLLY: Now, Hannah, that's not what I meant, you know. Uh, yeah, everybody relies on you for so much. You're so giving. It's not a criticism. We love you. We're grateful.""
HANNAH: You're grateful, but you resent me.
HOLLY: Oh, wow! I don't want to have this conversation. I didn't do anything wrong.
HOLLY: Y-you mentioned to me yourself that you and Elliot were having some problems.
HANNAH: Yeah, we're having some problems, but problems that are my business...which I don't see how you could know about in such detail. How does Lee know about these things? How? They're private!
HOLLY: Well, why don't you share them with us?
HANNAH: I don't...I don't want to bother everyone.
HOLLY: That's the point. I'd like to be bothered.
HANNAH: I don't see how you could know about these things unless Elliot's been talking to you.
HOLLY: No, he hasn't. If I offended you, I'm sorry.
LEE: It's over, Elliot. I don't know how to make it any clearer. It's over. I can't see you anymore.
ELLIOT: Uh... I-I-I know. I deserve this.
LEE: Look, I'm just as much at fault.
ELLIOT: If-if-if you can believe I have such feelings for you!
LEE: I've got to be honest with you. I met someone else. I've met someone else. I...I told you I wasn't going to wait forever.
ELLIOT: But it hasn't been forever.
LEE: It's been nearly a year since our first time and you're still married to my sister, which...I now realize is fine because you're probably much more in love with her than you know.
ELLIOT: Yeah, but we-we made so many plans.
LEE: Yeah. Uh, well, sure we did. An- an-and in a way you led me on, because I truly believed you were unhappy with Hannah. Otherwise, I would never have let myself be drawn in. I was very weak. So were you. Now I've met someone else.
