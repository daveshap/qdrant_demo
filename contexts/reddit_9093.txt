I am interested in a general discussion about Merrick Garland's nomination to SCOTUS.
As many of you likely saw, Obama nominated Merrick Garland to the supreme court today.

Newsweek has an exhaustive resume here:

General consensus on the other political subreddits is that Garland is a centrist, with one exception being a more liberal stance on gun rights.  The NY Times, however, puts him squarely in the liberal camp:

His nomination obviously has a lot of implications for the court (should he be confirmed), for the election, and for the potential of affecting the future makeup of the senate (should congress continue down their current strategic path).  I am interested in hearing the community's thoughts on his nomination.
