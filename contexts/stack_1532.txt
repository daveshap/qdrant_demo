Supercapacitor electric model I am doing a dissertation in Electrical and Computer Engineer which involves supercapacitors. I read the norm IEC/EN 62391\u20131 and the 60384-1 but still I don't have a clear answer for what's the electric model to be used to simulate a ultracapacitor. It seems to be a Series-equivalent circuit. (R_leakage || C ) in series with (R_ESR-L_ESL). But if in case I intend to use this model, I don't seem to find these parameters in the supercapacitor's datasheet, only C and R_ESR. What should I be looking for?
