FRANK: I've always respected Bree. I'd like to make something clear.
KLUTE: I've just got a few --
FRANK: I'd like to make something clear. I don't go after a girl; a girl comes to me. Her choice. Right?
KLUTE: I'm looking for a man. Tom Grunemann. Bree thinks he may have been the dumper -- that call she had two years ago. She says you sent her on it.
FRANK: Two years ago? Sorry.
KLUTE: They tell me you use narcotics. Could I bring someone around to look at your arms?
FRANK: Look -- dad -- I may stand better with the cops than you.
FRANK: OK, a family matter. Between the girls. I had two other cows -- -- two other girls besides Bree.
KLUTE: She told me.
FRANK: OK and one of them Jane McKenna -- she blows a little jealous of Bree - you know? -- Bree comes first? And evidently she knew the freak --- that he was a dumper -- she conned me into passing him to Bree, you know, so Bree'd get hurt. I didn't know. Till afterwards.
KLUTE: Why didn't you tell Bree, afterwards?
FRANK: You don't tell them. That one of their own in-laws laid a dumper on them? Peace in the family. Beyond that, I don't know. All she wrote.
KLUTE: I'd like to talk with Jane McKenna.
FRANK: Would I be telling you all this? She copped out long ago. She committed suicide Baxter.
BREE: Did you like my friend Frankie?
KLUTE: No.
BREE: Didn't he tell you what you wanted?
KLUTE: It didn't go anywhere. But that's not why --
BREE: About the dumper, didn't he tell you that?
KLUTE: It was Jane McKenna who sent you the dumper.
BREE: Well -- she's dead.
BREE: I thought you were going back to the apartment.
KLUTE: You said you wanted these.
BREE: Oh golly, oh just what I've always dreamed of, dirty phone calls. How come?
KLUTE: You told me what you could. I guess I'm through with your part of it.
BREE: Is there anything more I could --
KLUTE: I don't see anything, do you?
BREE: What're you gonna do next?
KLUTE: Try some other ways.
BREE: What do I do meanwhile? -- wait for that clown to fall through the skylight on me?
KLUTE: And I don't think that was Tom.
BREE: You said it was!
KLUTE: No, I said what did you think.
BREE: Oh -- wait -- oh I get it. You said that just to keep me scared. So I'd tell you everything I -- oh clever; oh you smart, tricky hick.
KLUTE: Well --
BREE: Hey, but did we get to you, Klute? A little?
KLUTE: Yeah, you got to me.
BREE: -- Us city folks? The sin, the glitter, the wickedness?
KLUTE: Oh. No. Not that way. I'd say it was more -- I don't know -- -- too bad? Pathetic?
BREE: Goodbye.
