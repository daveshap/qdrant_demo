Company VPN and privacy. (Cisco Anyconnect) Straight to the point. Is my employer able to see what websites I visited while I was connected to the VPN of the company?I'm pretty sure that all web internet traffic is routed on my private ISP because even when I'm connected to the VPN my IP on the internet is the same of my ISP.Also, Anyconnect reports \"Tunnel mode IPv4: split include\" so it seems that all personal traffic doesn't go through the tunnel.But given that, how can I know if my company is able to see my dns requests?Thanks everyoneps: the difference with the other question is that the other user talks about a physical connection in an office, inside a building of his company while I'm talking about a private machine in a private house connected through a vpn to the intranet of a company.
