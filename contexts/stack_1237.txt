Error on CDC enabled Table I am trying to create an SP on a CDC enabled database. SP contain an update statement for CDC enabled table using UPDATETEXT command but CREATE PROCEDURE statement has generated an ERROR Message.<blockquote>  \"UPDATETEXT is not allowed because the column is being processed by a concurrent snapshot or is being       replicated to a non-SQL Server Subscriber or Published in a publication allowing Data Transformation Services (DTS) or       tracked by Change Data Capture.\"</blockquote>I have followed the instructions on a post that disable CDC for the table for which sp has command UPDATETEXT and then create SP and after sp creation re- enable CDC for that tableQuestion: Whats the reason behind this Error ?  Will UPDATETEXT command effect logging in future? because we are thinking to use CDC for auditing change.
