MURTOGG: What's your name?
JACK: Smith.
MULLROY: What's your business in Port Royal, 'Mr. Smith'?
MURTOGG: And no lies!
JACK: None? Very well. You rumbled me. I confess: I intend to commandeer one of these ships, pick up a crew in Tortuga, and go on the account, do a little honest pirating.
MURTOGG: I said, no lies.
MULLROY: I think he's telling the truth.
MURTOGG: He's not telling the truth.
MULLROY: He may be.
MURTOGG: If he were telling truth he wouldn't have told us.
