LANGSTON: There are three strangers in this room, traveller, and these gents you are accusing aren't them. Are these your friends?
MAL: I wanted a drink and a bed. I guess I came to the wrong place.
LANGSTON: Came to the wrong town. I don't tolerate this kind of thing. It's hard on the peace, and it's hard on the furniture. Now, knowing a bit about Carter here, I'm going to let you go without paying for the damages. But go you will, and I mean now.
MAL: Is there a place in town that takes... my kind?
LANGSTON: You misunderstand. I want you out of town. In fact, I want you all the way out of my jurisdiction.
MAL: That ain't right.
LANGSTON: I decide what's right in this jurisdiction. Now move.
PROPRIETOR: Who's going to pay for all this, Sheriff?
LANGSTON: Don't press your luck, Carter.
LANGSTON: Now let's talk about you chaps.
PADEN: We'd rather stay.
LANGSTON: We'll see about that. I'm Sheriff John Langston. As you may have guessed, I am not from these parts.
PADEN: You're kidding.
LANGSTON: But the good citizens of Turley have taken me in their embrace, and for one simple reason. I maintain the peace. So when strangers come to town, I always ask them their business. Have you come for the hanging?
EMMETT: I'm just meeting a guy here and moving on. So far I haven't been able to find him.
LANGSTON: In my town, when you're looking for someone, you ask me.
EMMETT: All right. I'm looking for a young fella, full of juice. About my size, wears a fancy two-gun rig.
