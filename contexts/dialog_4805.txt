FRANK: I'm not feeling very well, Larry. I say we go back to the hospital and call it a night.
LARRY: You have no sick time, Frank. No time of any kind. Everyone knows that.
FRANK: Take me back, put me to bed; I surrender. We've done enough damage tonight.
LARRY: You take things too seriously. Look at us, we're cruising around, talking, taking some quiet time, getting paid for it. We've got a good job here.
FRANK: Yeah, you're right.
FRANK: Tell me, you ever think of doing anything else?
LARRY: Sure, I'm taking the captain's exam next year. After the kids are in school, Louise can go back to the post office and, I thought, what the hell, I'll start my own medic service. Out on the Island the volunteers are becoming salaried municipal. It's just a matter of time and who you know. Someday it's going to be Chief Larry calling the shots.
