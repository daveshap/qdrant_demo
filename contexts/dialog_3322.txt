EVE: Oh, Ben - I miss you so when I'm out... How are you feeling?
RAND: Tired... And I'm getting tired of being so tired. Other than that, I'm doing very well.
EVE: No headaches?
RAND: No, it's been a good day - better than yours, from what I've been told.
EVE: You heard?
RAND: I may be a shut-in, but I do not lack for news. I'm sorry you had to go through all that.
EVE: Oh, it wasn't all that bad, darling. We were fortunate that Mr. Gardiner turned out to be so reasonable.
RAND: Reasonable? Good, I'd like to meet a reasonable man. Why don't you ask this Gardiner to join us for dinner?
EVE: Do you feel well enough for that?
RAND: Hah!... Tell me the truth, Eve - if I wait until I feel better, will I ever meet the man?
