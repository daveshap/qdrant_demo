TEDDY: What difference does it make whether he			* was your guy or not?						 *
LEONARD: It makes all the difference.					 *
TEDDY: Why? You're never going to know.				 *
LEONARD: Yes, I will.
TEDDY: No, you won't.
LEONARD: Somehow, I'll know!
TEDDY: You won't remember!
LEONARD: When it's done, I'll know! It'll be different!
TEDDY: I thought so too! I was sure you'd				* remember. But you didn't.					 *
TEDDY: You know, when we found your guy and			 * killed him. That's right, the real John G. Over a			 * year ago. I helped you find him. He's			 * already dead.							 *
LEONARD: Why do you keep lying to me?					 *
TEDDY: I'm not. I was the cop assigned to your			* wife's death. I believed you, I thought			* you deserved the chance for revenge. I helped you find the other guy who was in your bathroom that night. The guy who cracked your skull and fucked your wife.		 * We found him and you killed him.				 * MEMENTO - Green Revisions 10-4-99 115A.
LEONARD: So who are you saying he was?					*
TEDDY: Just some guy. Does it even matter who? I stopped asking myself why a long time ago. No reason, no conspiracy; just bad fucking luck. A couple of junkies, too			 * strung out to realize that your wife didn't live alone. When you killed him,			* I've never seen you so happy - I was convinced you'd remember. But it didn't stick, like nothing ever sticks. Like this won't stick.
LEONARD							 *: * Thank you.							 *
TEDDY: Fuck you; I gave you a reason to live and		 * you were more than happy to help. You lie		 * to yourself! You don't want the truth,			 * the truth is a fucking coward. So you			 * make up your own truth.						 *
LEONARD: You probably.							 *
TEDDY: No. You took them out.						 *
LEONARD: Why would I do that?						 *
TEDDY: To set yourself a puzzle you won't ever solve. You know how many towns, how many		 * guys called James G? Or John G? Shit, Leonard, I'm a John G.
LEONARD: Your name's Teddy.
TEDDY: My mother calls me Teddy. I'm John Edward Gammell. Cheer up, there's a lot of John		 * G's for us to find. All you do is moan.			* I'm the one that has to live with what			 * you've done. I'm the one that has to put		 * it all together. You just wander around			* playing detective. You're living a dream,		 * kid. A dead wife to pine for and a sense		 * of purpose to your life. A romantic quest		 * which you wouldn't end even if I wasn't			* in the picture.							 *
LEONARD: I should kill you.							 *
TEDDY: Quit it!							 * 					 * You're not a killer, Lenny. That's why			 * you're so good at it.						 *
