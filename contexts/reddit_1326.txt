Does anyone get anxious about engaging with their old hobbies? I get so panicked and feel like a failure when I just want to chill and have fun.
I’ve been trying really hard recently to take up some of my old pastimes again. I used to love reading, playing ukulele, drawing, playing video games. Now I get a huge feeling of anxiety creep over me when I try to get back into them.

 I think its a confidence issue? Like not feeling good enough at playing the ukulele, or not being good enough at drawing or playing games. I went to a private school where competitiveness was drummed into us. I was considered dumb because I didn’t get A* in everything and I really tied my self-worth to my abilities academically. 

Now I feel like my self-worth is tied to my pastimes. They’re meant to be the things that make me interesting as a person, I should be good at them and see progress in them. Am I even the person I think I am now that I’m too anxious to do any of these things? 

Another issue is feeling anxious that I’m possibly wasting time. I used to love sitting playing games for hours but now I feel this weight on my shoulder and pain in my chest. I feel like I should be doing something more proactive, even if I have nothing else I really need to be doing. 

I’ve started working with polymer clay because its something new and therapeutic and creative. I’ll hopefully see some progress and build up my confidence in myself, instead of feeling like I’ve lost the knack for things I used to enjoy. 

I just feel ridiculous when I take a step back and look at myself. I’m having heart palpitations just trying to relax and do something I used to enjoy. How many of you can relate? I feel like most people stop doing the things they love because of depression/a loss of motivation and interest.
