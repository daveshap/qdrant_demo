MURPHY: Showing you what?
EPPS: What happened.
MURPHY: Maybe it was one of them did the handy work on those Greeks.
EPPS: No. I think they are, were, just passengers. Innocent victims.
MURPHY: Victims of what?
EPPS: Something bad happened here, Murphy.

EPPS: She said the ship was evil. That we had to leave right away. That if we didn't, we might never leave.

MURPHY: Why you? How come the rest of us haven't seen these people?
EPPS: Just lucky I guess.
