This is ruining my life, I am such a pushover
Why am I like this? I've always been that person who says "whatever is the best for you" when someone asks me if I prefer x or y. And I also don't know what I would prefer, so I let others decide for me. It's like I am afraid of making the wrong decision and I can't handle the consequences. I have always been like that, since I was a child, teachers used to tell me that I should accept error as a part of life, and I know that, but still I just can't change my behavior. Also I don't trust myself either, I always think that the others opinion or way to do something is right/better and mine is wrong/worse. I just can't stand this anymore, I don't know what to do to change this. I have been doing therapy for 3 years now and it doesn't seem to help.
