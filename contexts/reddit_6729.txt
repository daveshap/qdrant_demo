Is the recruiter lying to me or am I overthinking things?
I got a text from a recruitment agency  asking me to call the recruiter.  Before I called I checked my email and I saw that I was sent a role and the job spec has the start date and end date on it as well as the typical spec stuff. 

It looked like a good role so I called back immediately to discuss the role only for the recruiter to tell me she can’t answer my questions and I should put it in an email and they’d respond when they speak to the client. 

Please bare in mind that one of the questions I asked was about the start and end date for the role because it seemed like she changed her mind about representing me.  I think it’s weird that she suddenly cannot answer me but the email says that their are short listing candidates in a couple of hours for the role. 


Am I being paranoid or is she lying?
