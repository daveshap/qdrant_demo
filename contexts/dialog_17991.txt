AGATHA: Where are we going?
ANDERTON: Someplace safe.
AGATHA: I have to go back.
ANDERTON: Why?
AGATHA: The other two will die without me.
ANDERTON: You want to spend the rest of your life in the temple?
AGATHA: I always wondered what the world would be like. But now that I've seen it, I don't need to see any more. It's all right. Once I'm in the tank, I won't remember any of this.
ANDERTON: Agatha, you're never going back there.
AGATHA: I am going back. I see myself there.
