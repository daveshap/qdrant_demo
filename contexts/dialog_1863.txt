MISS OLSEN: Did you have a nice Christmas?
SHELDRAKE: Lovely. You were a big help.
MISS OLSEN: Me? SHELDRAKE Thank you for giving that little pep talk to Miss Kubelik at the office party.
MISS OLSEN: I'm sorry, Jeff. You know I could never hold my liquor --
SHELDRAKE: But I thought you could hold your tongue.
MISS OLSEN: It won't happen again.
SHELDRAKE: You bet it won't. I'll arrange for you to get a month's severance pay -- That's right, Miss Olsen. I'm letting you go.
MISS OLSEN: You let me go four years ago, Jeff. Only you were cruel enough to make me sit out there and watch the new models pass by.
SHELDRAKE: I'd appreciate it if you'd be out of here as soon as you can.
MISS OLSEN: Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.
