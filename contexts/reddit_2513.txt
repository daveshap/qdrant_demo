Furloughed over a month ago, now employer posted an ad for the position I was about to take. Should I reach out?
So I used to work in the accounting department, then got a great job offer elsewhere, gave my notice, but employer lured me into getting a nice promotion to the finance department and stay. I stayed. I didn’t do well, hated my job, felt miserable. Beginning of 2020 I spoke to my boss about my dissatisfaction and asked him for my old job in accounting back. He agreed and seemed understanding but I had to stay with finance until a big project I was involved with was done (beginning April). I was happy!

Then pandemic happened... all that big project (the yearly budget) became void and I got furloughed. They were apologetic and I have since filed for unemployment and I’m home waiting to get a call back (and living my best life tbh). However, a good friend who’s a coworker in that accounting department gave his notice two weeks ago, and suggested me reach out to them to try and get back to the accounting department (remember, the CFO back in January promised me). I didn’t and now I found out that the company posted a google ad and on their website that they’re hiring for such position in accounting ON THE DAY MY COWORKER GAVE HIS NOTICE!!!! KILL ME!

I feel pretty hurt that they didn’t consider me back - kinda feels like they just wanted to get rid of me, and found an excuse. I excelled at my accounting job, and looks like the other ppl who got furloughed were all notably incompetent ppl. 

I need advice... should I reach out to the cfo who promised me the job and ask what’s up? Or should I let it go and wait/start looking for another job? 

TL;DR: furloughed, now they’re hiring for my position; should I reach out and ask them what’s up?
