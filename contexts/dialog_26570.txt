MACKELWAY: Was this him?
CANDY: Um... he was older.
MACKELWAY: Besides that.
CANDY: To be honest, when I'm working, I don't look at faces much. He knew the guy's name.
MACKELWAY: Testa?
CANDY: The bearded guy, the creep. Oh, one other thing. Testa, if that's his name, he kept mentioning my feet. Said I had very pretty feet.
MACKELWAY: Find the feet?
KULOK: No. Cut off while he was still alive, look at his wrists, damn near ripped his hands off trying to get free. Must have been screaming real loud when the killer chain-sawed his throat. Unfortunately, he'd soundproofed his van.
MACKELWAY: We got an UNSUB walking around with four feet?
KULOK: We did find these, however.
MACKELWAY: Jesus.
KULOK: We're trying to match them with dump site bodies. This we know is Carol Delview from Tampa, found her last Spring. This one --
MACKELWAY: The tattoo?
KULOK: Sue Ann Hanson.
MACKELWAY: You mean --
KULOK: You found the body. She was one of Harold Speck's victims. In El Paso. They're not just talking to each other, Mack, they're trading souvenirs.
MACKELWAY: Did they disconnect Testa's computer?
KULOK: Not yet. This time they're waiting for you.
