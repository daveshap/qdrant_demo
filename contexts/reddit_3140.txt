Management is discussing changing my role from 9-5 to on call overnight. What should I do?
So I work in client services in an account manger type role. It's currently a Monday to Friday 9-5 job. We have a new service where a file transfer happens from 12-3 AM overnight 6 nights a week. 

Management is discussing having me on call during that  file transfer in case of issues. Thing is I only started 6 weeks ago and didn't sign up for this. It was clearly communicated this was a 9-5 with work life balance. I work in client relations, so I'm not trained in IT nor am I a technical professional. 

You guys have any advice? 

FYI I think I would accept this if I were given a 30k raise, a work phone, and fully remote working option.
