LEX: Do you realize what I can create with a single strand of Superman's hair!
LENNY: A toupee that flies?
LEX: . . . I look at you, Lenny, and I know how the Romans felt when the barbarians arrived at their city gate.
LENNY: But why the hair?
LEX: That hair contains a sample of Superman's genetic material. The building blocks of his body. With my genius and enough nuclear power to mutate those genes, I will create a being with all his powers . . . but with absolute allegiance to me!
LACY: It's brilliant. Daddy thinks so, too. You'll write a new series -- 'Metropolis After Hours.'
CLARK: I really don't think . . .
LACY: But you're perfect for it. You're young, you're single, you're successful...
CLARK: And I'm usually in bed by ten-thirty.
LACY: That's just it! You don't have to flaunt it. You're no slave to fashion ... although ...
CLARK: They make my eyes itch.
LACY: Don't worry. I won't make you do it alone. I know all the right places. I'm a member at all the right clubs . . . We'll start tonight at the grand opening of the Metro Club! It's a date!
