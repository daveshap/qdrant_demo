Do the superdelegates in the democratic primary actually matter?
Following the Wisconsin primaries, the current tally of ordinary delegates for Clinton is 1,274, while Sanders has 1,025. The vast majority of superdelegates have pledged their support for Clinton, taking her to 1,743 vs Sanders 1,056. A summary of the results can be seen [here](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/us/elections/primary-calendar-and-results.html).

The sum of delegates plus superdelegates suggests that Clintons lead is significantly larger, then, than that of voted and caucused delegates alone. However there is no precedent for superdelegates to go against the aggregate public vote and the democratic party would likely lose considerable public goodwill should they be seen to be 'kingmaking' against the will of democratic public.

I understand their role insofar as ensuring the leading canditate has a 'solid mandate', however I am unsure of their role beyond that. 

What am I missing? Do the superdelegates in the democratic primary actually matter?
