ELAINE: Jenny was supposed to come to my place that night. She called me, asked if she could come over. She and Terry had been -- having some trouble. Lately. I don't know about what. On this occasion, it reached some sort of crisis point.
WILSON: She told you all about my details but not about his. Lovely.
ELAINE: She'd never called me like that before. She sounded more ... pissed off -- angry -- than upset or afraid. But she never turned up. I called the house but only got the answer machine. When they found her ... she'd been going the wrong way. Not the direction she'd have gone if she'd been coming to see me. Or coming <u>straight</u> to see me. Who knows. Maybe she just wanted to drive.
WILSON: How did you come to have my address? Found it, did you. Among her things.
ELAINE: You think Terry gave me access to her things? Probably sold her clothes.
WILSON: And how did you get it?
