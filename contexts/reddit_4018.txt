FINALLY...
After countless first dates that go nowhere, dealing with about 5 different ghosts in 6 months, and the flakes.... I'm glad to say I've finally found myself a girlfriend who has everything I'm exactly looking for. Keep your heads up my friends, nothing in life is easy, but that doesn't mean you need to give up.
