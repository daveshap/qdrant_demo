STOSH: Look at her! Isn't she beautiful! Married an orchestra leader!
HARRY: So what? There's other women!
STOSH: Not for me! Betty! Betty!
HARRY: Cut it out. Animal! I'll fix you up with a couple of those Russian women!
STOSH: You'll fix me up!
HARRY: Sure, Animal! I'll get you over there!
STOSH: How? Pinky Miller from Barrack 8 tried to get over there and they shot him in the leg!
HARRY: It takes a gimmick, Animal, and I figured us a little gimmick.
STOSH: You did?
HARRY: Sharp. Sometimes I'm so sharp it's frightening.
HARRY: To the Brick Kremlin!
STOSH: She'll never forgive me!
HARRY: Bombs away!
