ROSENFELD: ...go on, go on...
WOODWARD: That's everything Bachinski had, I think it's worth following up.
ROSENFELD: Don't know; who the hell's Howard Hunt? It's probably nothing but check it out. Just go easy, it could be crazy Cubans.
SIMONS: Anything?
ROSENFELD: Woodward's onto a new wrinkle with the break-in thing--absolute page one stuff--
SIMONS: --in other words, you got nothing, you're thumbsucking.
ROSENFELD: Could develop.
SIMONS: Let me see what you get, but don't jump--The New York Times thinks it's crazy Cubans.
ROSENFELD: OK, get on this W.House guy and do a better job then you did on McCord.
WOODWARD: I did all right on McCord.
ROSENFELD: Then how come the Associated Press were the ones found out that Mr. McCord is security coordinator for the Committee to Re-elect the President, otherwise known as CREEP?
WOODWARD: The head of security for the reelection of a Republican President got caught bugging the national offices of the Democrats? What the hell does that mean?
ROSENFELD: Mr. John Mitchell, the head of CREEP, says it means nothing. ...This man and the other people involved were not operating on either our behalf or with our consent. These is no place in our campaign or in the electoral process for this type of activity
WOODWARD: You can't believe that.
ROSENFELD: As a rough rule of thumb, as far as I can throw Bronco Nagurski, that's how much I trust John Mitchell...
ROSENFELD: What'd you get on W.House?
WOODWARD: Lotsa hints--
ROSENFELD: I can't sell hints to Simons-- --you called everyone you know? Call someone you don't know.
