CARMEN: Romance is just a vestigial biological response to procreation...
JOHNNY: Aw, you're in love with me... You just dont know it yet.
JOHNNY: Wait, I want to talk to Mr. Rasczak.
CARMEN: I'll meet you outside.
JOHNNY: Mister Rasczak ?
RASCZAK: What is it, Rico ?
JOHNNY: I just wanted to say thanks 'cause History and Moral Philosophy was the best class I had this year.
RASCZAK: Well, it's not really my job to please. Hope you learned something.
JOHNNY: I wanna join up, Mr. Rasczak. I think I have what it take to be a citizen.
RASCZAK: Good for you. Go find out.
JOHNNY: Well, my parents are against it, and I know it's my choice, but I was wondering... What would you do if you were me ?
RASCZAK: Figuring things out for yourself is the only freedom anyone really has. Use that freedom. Make your own choice, Rico.
CARMEN: Johnny, this is Zander.
ZANDER: Yeah, we know each other from the game. No hard feeling, eh, chum ?
JOHNNY: None at all... We won.
CARMEN: Good luck at the academy.
