NATHAN: Puff, put the gun down.
PUFF: Ounpoo. Ungh.
NATHAN: Let's be reasonable human beings here. We're all reasonable human beings, aren't we?
PUFF: Unka unka unka unka unka.
NATHAN: Look, why don't you and Lila stay here and have your natural life. I'll just go on my way. You'll never see me again.
PUFF: I have to talk. Is that okay?
PUFF: You did create me in your image, Nathan. Before you I was a simple, happy, complete being, in harmony with the world around me. After you I became duplicitous, cynical, angry, anal, totally out of touch with my surroundings. In a word, Nathan, I became you. Lila has reintroduced me to myself. And, incidentally, what I'm about to do, kill you, is something that would never have occurred to me to do as a creature of the Earth. Before when I killed, it was for food or in self-defense. Now I will kill for revenge. Revenge is an abstract concept, Nathan. And I learned abstract thinking from you.
NATHAN: No.
