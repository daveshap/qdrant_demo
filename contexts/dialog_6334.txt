JAKE: When this is all over, you're going to tell me who the King put on Al.
LUPUS: You going to have the time?
JAKE: I'll find the time.
LILY: Look at you... You want to go.
JAKE: For what? A couple hundred bucks?
LILY: I think you'd do it for free. You're almost drooling. You like the rush.
JAKE: It's what I do. It's my job.
LILY: Why? Your mother not breast feed you or something?
JAKE: Are you asking me if I have something to prove?
LILY: Do you have something to prove?
JAKE: Not in that repressed anger sort of way.
LILY: I'm your basic underachiever. Can't stand working and porn doesn't seem like a good option.
JAKE: Good quality porn has it's place in the world.
LILY: Whatever. But you... I get the feeling you could have bullshitted your way into anything. So why this?
JAKE: I'm good at it. Lying, cheating, manipulating... I'm good at it.
LILY: It's more than that.
JAKE: Intuition. It doesn't make you Yoda. Like tonight. You killed that guy tonight. But I knew you would.
LILY: So that was my part? Smile and shake my ass?
JAKE: No. You have another part? You'll know what to do.
LILY: How do you know I will?
JAKE: Intuition.
LILY: You have really soft hands. Like a baby's.
JAKE: Don't ruin this for me.
BUTCH: Is that what it was, Jake? Was it love?
JAKE: You know when the first con was ever played? It was when Adam fell for Eve in the Garden of Eden.
