MILLER: I, I tried to go back for him, to save him, but I couldn't get to him in time. The fire... Have you ever seen fire in zero-gravity? It's like a liquid, it slides over everything. It was like a wave breaking over him, a wave of fire. And then he was gone. I never told anyone until now. But this ship knew, DJ. It knows about the Goliath, it knows about Corrick. It knows our secrets. It knows what we're afraid of. And now you're going to tell me it's carbon dioxide.
DJ: No.
MILLER: What is it?
DJ: I've been listening to the transmission. And I think Houston made a mistake in the translation.
MILLER: Go on.
DJ: They thought it said, Liberatis me
MILLER: It's not a distress call. It's a warning.
DJ: It gets worse.
