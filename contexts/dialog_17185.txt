CATHERINE: Hey! What are you doing here?
MRS. PILLETTI: I came to see you. How you feel?
CATHERINE: I gotta pain in my left side, and my leg throbs like a drum.
MRS. PILLETTI: I been getting a pain in my shoulder.
CATHERINE: I gotta pains in my shoulder too. I have a pain in my hip, and my right arm aches so much I can't sleep. It's a curse to be old. How you feel?
MRS. PILLETTI: I feel fine.
CATHERINE: That's nice.
