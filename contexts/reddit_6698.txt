Recruiter asking me to lie on my resume?
Hi, I've got a quick question that I could use some help with:

I applied for a job as a Junior Technical Writer at some sort of tech company, and a recruiter from this company just contacted me asking for an updated resume.
 
I sent him my resume, which hasn't changed since I initially applied for the job, but he responded saying that the job requires some sort of technical writing experience (which I don't have) and to please send him an updated resume indicating that I have technical writing experience.

Basically, it sounds like he wants to me fabricate some sort of position where I worked as a technical writer. Could this backfire for me? Why can't we just be honest about my lack of experience? 

I would appreciate any quick replies, I'm supposed to talk to his manager in about 3 hours and I don't know what I'm going to do. I already feel suspicious because the recruiter tried to low-ball me during our initial phonecall, offering me a wage less than the advertised amount.
