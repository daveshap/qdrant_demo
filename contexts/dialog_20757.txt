SEIDMAN: Jesus.
ANDREW: I don't know what to do, Bob.
SEIDMAN: You'll never find it in the dark.
SEIDMAN: What in God's name... ?
ANDREW: Bob...
SEIDMAN: What's wrong with your face?
ANDREW: What's wrong with my face? You want to know what's wrong with my face? I've got a skin condition. Next question, Bob? No more questions? Fine. Now can you help me find the complaint?
SEIDMAN: Allright. Calm down.
ANDREW: Sorry...
SEIDMAN: What was the file name?
ANDREW: K-R-O-one.
SEIDMAN: Maybe you mistyped the name when you were saving it. We'll try combinations of those letters...
ANDREW: You're right, I probably just misfiled...
KENTON: Andy?
