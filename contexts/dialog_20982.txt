SUSAN: Under the circumstances, I can't fathom what makes Dr. Argon think we are ready for anything bigger. If C.N.N., or hell, if the E.P.A. knew what was in my basement --
POPPY: Is that a threat, Dr. Bright?
SUSAN: Look, as I have said and will continue to say, the instability of the assembler waste remains my priority --
POPPY: While you remain on the staff at Argon Laboratories, your priorities will always be the same as Dr. Argon's priorities. I imagine that is a simple enough equation for a bright girl like you to figure out.
POPPY: If you don't have any questions, I'll let you get back to doing your job.
SUSAN: Just one question. Since Dr. Argon no longer has feeling below his waist, how is it that you're still able to do your job?
POPPY: I could have you fired right now.
SUSAN: You won't. That's why you're whispering.
