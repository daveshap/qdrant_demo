How come dating is so easy for some people?
22m virgin here, never been on a date. I'm actually perplexed at how easy some people have it when it comes to dating. Most people have met someone who is interested in having sex with them by the age of 17. How the fuck? I have tried every free dating site, never got a match or reply. Been clubbing numerous times, women just walk off or turn around when you approach. Joined hobby clubs at university, no women were interested.

How do some people manage to date multiple people by the age of 25? It just seems so bizarre to me when getting a women's number is a mission. I take care of myself, work out, make sure my clothes and hygiene are on point yet still have never met a woman who wanted to date me.

I guess my question is, how do some of you find getting dates so easy? What are you doing that some of us aren't? Thank you.
