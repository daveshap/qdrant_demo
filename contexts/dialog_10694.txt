ENID: Thanks for the tape - I'll have to pay you later, I'm broke.
JOHN: Hey, where are you going?
ENID: Later, Dude"."
REBECCA: Much later.
ENID: In fact, never.
REBECCA: What do you do if you're a satanist, anyway?
ENID: You know, sacrifice virgins and stuff...
REBECCA: That lets us off the hook.
ENID: Maybe there's some weird secret satanic society that meets at the Quality Cafe and all of the other regular customers are in on it except for us.
REBECCA: Or maybe not.
ENID: Maybe they're slowly poisoning us or they're planning to brainwash us and --
REBECCA: Okay, okay!
ENID: Hey, look at this...
ENID: Authentic 50's diner"? Since when were there mini-malls in the 1950's?"
REBECCA: God, it's so totally pathetic.
REBECCA: Who can forget this great hit from the 50's?
ENID: I feel as though I've stepped into a time warp!
