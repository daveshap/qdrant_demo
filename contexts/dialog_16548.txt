GEORGE: Just what I needed too.
CONWAY: You?
GEORGE: Just this once, Bob. I feel like celebrating. Just think of it, Bob - a cruiser sent to Shanghai just to take you back to England. You know what it means. Here you are. Don't bother about those cables now. I want you to drink with me. Gentlemen, I give you Robert Conway - England's new Foreign Secretary.
CONWAY: Hurray!
GEORGE: How I'm going to bask in reflected glory! People are going to point to me and say, There goes George Conway - brother of the Foreign Secretary.""
CONWAY: Don't talk nonsense. Give me the bottle.
