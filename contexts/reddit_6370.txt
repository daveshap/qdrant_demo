How I received multiple offers in a couple of months
1) Find a job that you like. I find that LinkedIn is the best, Monster and other sites work well too.

2) Find many jobs. Even if you are skeptical you might turn out to like the company or the people. Also it's better to mess-up an interview at a company you don't like than your dream job. Interviewing is a skill like anything else it gets better with practice. Nothing is better practice than getting out and doing it.

3) Find the right person. If you can on LinkedIn find out who posted the job and contact them directly. Always ask for advice. I would put the subject line as "Advice for someone interested in working at Company name". Then I would ask for advice. It would really help me stand out from the crowd of people who just hit apply now.

4) Follow up. Many people are busy, don't hesitate to follow up a couple of times.

5) Write thank you cards. They're a small touch but help you stand out.

6) Be prepared. Know about the company and people that you're interviewing you.

7) Keep track of everything. I like Evernote and would have a note on each company. What I did to contact them, when I followed up, who I spoke to, what my next step was. I also set a quota of finding 10 jobs a day to apply to.
