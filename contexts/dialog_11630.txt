ROY: If I should get out of the racket, that goes double for you. That's why you've got to change your life completely, go to some town, get a square job, live like a john yourself. If you try to do it your way, what future is in it?
LILLY: A future. The only future I've got.
ROY: That money wouldn't last forever. And then what? You'd be back in some other part of the rackets. Another Bobo Justus to slap you around and burn holes in your hands. This way, you've got to go the square route. You could send me a card when you're settled, I could maybe help out sometimes...
LILLY: ) That's what it is, isn't it? Keep me down. Your turn to be in charge, have the power.
ROY: Just trying to help, Lilly.
LILLY: Roy... What if I told you I wasn't really your mother? That we weren't related?
ROY: What?
