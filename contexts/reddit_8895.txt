Congress has overridden Obama's veto on the 'Saudi Sept 11' bill. What are the consequences of this?
From [rt](https://www.rt.com/usa/360975-senate-overrides-veto-jasta/):

> JASTA, which passed unanimously in both the House and the Senate, allows US judges to waive sovereign immunity claims when dealing with acts of terrorism committed on American soil â€“ potentially allowing lawsuits against Saudi Arabia over the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. 

President Obama vetoed the bill on September 23rd ([source](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/09/23/495249958/obama-vetoes-bill-to-allow-sept-11-victims-to-sue-saudi-government)), but

[From Reuters](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-sept11-saudi-idUSKCN11Y2D1): 

> The House of Representatives voted 348-77 against the veto, hours after the Senate rejected it 97-1, meaning the "Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act" will become law.



What are the consequences of this bill?  Can this lead to the US being sued in foreign courts, as some suggest?  

Or is this bill purely symbolic or does it contain loopholes that make it ineffective? (e.g. would the unlimited extensions from the attorney general make it impossible to settle a case, as suggested by [source](https://www.justsecurity.org/31156/senate-killed-jasta-passed-it/))

There was a little discussion of how the lawsuits allowed by this bill would work a few weeks ago in this sub [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/52hkbi/what_would_a_lawsuit_against_saudi_arabia_look/?st=itno66f8&sh=1d9ed0fa), but that was before it was passed/vetoed/overruled, and I'm more interested in the consequences.
