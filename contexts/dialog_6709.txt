GOVERNESS: I've made you silk pajamas. Do you want to change into them?
JEN: Put them down.
GOVERNESS: I heard you met Shu Lien today.
JEN: Do you know her?
GOVERNESS: She's one of those. Your mother would not want you consorting with her kind.
JEN: I'll socialize with whomever I please.
GOVERNESS: Don't invite danger into your father's house.
JEN: I'm tired now.
GOVERNESS: Go to bed then. Miss has grown up, and is getting married soon. God knows what the future will bring.
JEN: It will be just the same. Enough! I'm tired.
GOVERNESS: Autumn is coming. I'll shut the windows for you.
