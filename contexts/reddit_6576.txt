What do you do at work when you have nothing to do and can’t leave?
Unfortunately, this tends to be a weekly problem for me at my job. I was originally full time but went down to part time since there wasn’t enough for me to do. I now work 3 days a week and about 1.5-2 days a week I have maybe 15 minutes of work to do yet I have to stay for the whole day. I’ve asked for more work and there just isn’t any. I’m bored out of my mind! 

I know people might say “look for a new job” which I’m currently doing, but in the mean time I need to do something while I’m still here.
