RAY: You burned an American flag today. And left it for me...
MAGGIE: -- You desecrated it, it had to be burned.
RAY: I desecrated it?
MAGGIE: You forced an innocent man to run like an animal. You've tried to poison my people's hearts against me with your manipulation, with letters I never wrote... you've been watching me eat, work, raise my family... wash myself in the river. And now you're here, arresting me at a sacred place. In your eyes, that's power.
