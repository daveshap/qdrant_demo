SANDRO: Patrizia, what are you going to do?
PATRIZIA: What do you want us to do? I don't know myself... But we'll do something.
SANDRO: I'll go and get my valise.
PATRIZIA: We've decided to go to Montaldo's place. In fact, Ettore should already be there.
SANDRO: Good. Then I'll meet you there.
CLAUDIA: I'm going with the patrol boat to make a tour around the islands.
PATRIZIA: To do what?
CLAUDIA: I just can't leave without first searching those islands, one by one.
PATRIZIA: But aren't you tired? I can just about manage to stand on my feet! Raimondo!
RAIMONDO: Here I am, Patrizia. I'm always here.
PATRIZIA: Claudia isn't coming with us. Will you please take care of her luggage? Thanks.
