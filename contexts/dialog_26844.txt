RIPLEY: Hello, Freddie, it's Tom, Tom Ripley.
FREDDIE: Oh hello, where's Dickie? How are you?
RIPLEY: Yes, I'm good, thank you. Dickies at dinner. He's at Otello's. Do you know it?
FREDDIE: I don't think he's at dinner at 6.30pm. If you said he was still at lunch I'd believe you. Incredible. The guy has disappeared off the face of the earth.
RIPLEY: I guess.
FREDDIE: The landlady -- as far as I could tell, the landlady said he was here right now.
RIPLEY: He's gone to dinner! Search the place. I can't think why you would imagine Dickie would hide from you.
FREDDIE: Because he's been hiding from me -- what happened at Christmas?
RIPLEY: What about Christmas?
FREDDIE: He was supposed to come skiing. I didn't get a cable or a call or a note or, frankly, a fart.
RIPLEY: Of course, he's been very involved in his music, hasn't he? I think his theory is, you know, you have to go into a cocoon before you can become a butterfly.
FREDDIE: Which is horseshit. Have you heard him play that thing? He can't.
RIPLEY: How did you find him? It's such an out of the way apartment. Can I fix you a drink?
FREDDIE: No thanks. Some kid at the American Express Office. Are you living here?
RIPLEY: No. No, I'm staying here for a few days, in Rome. That's a new piano, so you prob --
FREDDIE: Did this place come furnished? It doesn't look like Dickie. Horrible isn't it? -- so bourgeois.
RIPLEY: You should watch that!
FREDDIE: In fact the only thing which looks like Dickie is you.
RIPLEY: Hardly.
FREDDIE: Have you done something to your hair?
RIPLEY: Freddie, do you have something to say?
FREDDIE: What? I think I'm saying it. Something's going on. He's either converted to Christianity -- or to something else.
RIPLEY: I suggest you ask Dickie that yourself. Otello's is on delle Croce, just off the Corso.
FREDDIE: Is it on delle Croce
