MARGIE: What on earth is happening to you? Why are you acting this way?
WADE: It's my tooth! My fucking tooth! I can't even think anymore because of it.
MARGIE: I heard you talking. You got fired this morning, didn't you?
WADE: Look, that's temporary, believe me. There's so much shit gonna hit the fan the next few days, my getting fired by LaRiviere and Merritt won't matter a bit.
