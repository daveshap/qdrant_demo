A class action lawsuit has been filed seeking declaration that people held at the US border as a result of Trumps immigration orders, are being denied due process under the fifth amendment. Does the president have the power to create executive action to detain people entering the US indefinitely?
Here is the [source](http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/28/politics/2-iraqis-file-lawsuit-after-being-detained-in-ny-due-to-travel-ban/) talking about the lawsuit that has been filed.

-Do people entering the US have the right to due process under the fifth amendment? If so, what form of due process?

-What power does the president have to deprive people of the rights they have upon entry to the US?

-If successful, would this lawsuit essentially void a major part of Trumps executive order, with the only remaining effect being to stop visas being issued to people from the mentioned countries?

EDIT: For clarity
