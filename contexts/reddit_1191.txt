The worst thing for me about having generalized anxiety is I have anxiety about my anxiety.
I constantly feel the need to explain to people why I constantly over think or internalize everything. I don't want people to think I'm this crazy, narcissist that thinks the world revolves around me so I explain that I have pretty severe anxiety issues.... and then I worry that I'm that annoying person who constantly feels the need to justify their actions or statements by leaning heavily on a health issue.... so then I apologize for bringing it up so much. 

My anxiety disorder is causing me anxiety. 

I just left a comment about not being able to sleep at night because my brain won't shut down and I can't stop analyzing everything that I said or did throughout the day. It went from 1 to 0 in less than a minute so I deleted the comment because it sounded whiny and a little crazy. Why do I care so much about what other people think? Why do I worry so much about how I come across to others? It's exhausting.

I'm feeling shity, might delete later. IDK ðŸ˜˜
