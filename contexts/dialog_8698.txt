SISSY: I'm cold.
JULIAN: Here. I'll turn down the air conditioner.
SISSY: It's not the air conditioner that's making me cold. Nothing moves in here. Not even your birds.
JULIAN: What are you doing?
SISSY: Getting dressed. I've got to go.
JULIAN: But I don't want you to leave. Please stay. We can go to dinner. I owe you a dinner. And tonight... we can... really make love.
SISSY: I have to go, Julian.
JULIAN: Why? Why do you have to go?
SISSY: My thumbs hurt. I've made a mistake. I've been negligent. I haven't exercised. I have to hitchhike a little bit every day, no matter what. It's like a musician practicing his scales. When I don't practice, my timing gets off, my thumbs get stiff and sore.
