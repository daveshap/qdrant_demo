Just told we might not be paid for a month or longer, but still expected to perform all contract duties. Anyone else dealing with this?
The word came down from the dean's office today that our usual RA/TA contracts might not come until mid July at the earliest. However, we still must preform the duties in the contracts we don't have. I know some of us could hold out on savings, but they gave no end date or even a possible date of when we would get them. I know I can't just survive off of papers alone. Is anyone else's university doing this? How did you handle it?
