Can you please suggest something to learn during the quarantine, so that it will help me get a job later?
 Hello everyone!  
I just found this channel. I hope you're all doing fine.  
It was a long time ago since I posted something here.  
I graduated BA in English and Communications, but I really didn't like my major and was forced by my family to study there. I am in this big messy situation, I really love drawing. For the past 4-5 years, I have been drawing and I really had improved my skill. However, I can't find a job in my country (Armenia). So some of my relatives and my family members keep pushing me to find new interests and search jobs in different categories. I would like you to suggest some areas (such as programming, software testing, etc). My friends suggested me UI/UX design, web programming, and others. I just can't find any interest, so I beg you, please suggest me something.

Thank you in advance!  
P.S. Don't lose your hopes! We will beat through the virus!
