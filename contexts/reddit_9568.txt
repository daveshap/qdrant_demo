The Importance of Academic Advising
I am an academic advisor at a community college. I have been tasked with creating an online resource to train staff and faculty advisors.  As many of us know, in depth advising can have a positive impact on retention.  

I wanted to ask other student affairs specialists and advisors what you believe is the importance of academic advising?

What role does advising play in student's success?  

Do the advisors at your institution have case loads? 

I have a good amount of information compiled already, but would love to hear the opinion of others. 

Thanks!
