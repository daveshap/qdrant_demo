Will current employer disclosure that I am on FMLA and STD leave during an employment verification?
I am on FMLA and STD leave from my current employer, and managed to secure a job offer elsewhere. This is critical for my health as the current workplace is very toxic.

I was just informed that even though they already checked references, there is an employment verification check. It says they will contact my current employer for verification so, "please take measures in preparation."

Will my current employer disclose to the employment verification provider that I am currently on FMLA   and STD (short-term disability) leave? Will the employment verification provider tell my current employer that this is part of an onboarding process elsewhere?

The employment verification provider is ESR - employment screening resources. Thank you!!
