DETECTIVE HUGO: Positive saliva match. The cup was definitely used since the original sweep.
INVESTIGATOR: So we have two choices. Either our suspect came back to the murder scene for a drink of water and I don't know anybody that thirsty or... ...he <i>is</i> here. We test again. You're right, Hugo, this was a desperate act. Someone had a lot to lose that night--perhaps their place in line. I'd like the profiles of everyone with an upcoming mission.
DIRECTOR JOSEF: Twelve have a mission within the week.
INVESTIGATOR: This time I will supervise each test personally.
IRENE: What is it?
JEROME: I forgot something--something at home. I'll see you later.
