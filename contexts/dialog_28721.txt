RAY: South Dakota... Did I do something unsatisfactory, Sir?
COOCH: No, Ray. You're gonna have to blame that on your grandmother.
TULLY: Interesting bloodline you have, Ray. French, Scots-Irish, Italian, ...and one-eighth American Indian.
COOCH: Sioux Indian, right?
RAY: I'm not that sure. Yeah, I think --
TULLY: -- yes, Teton Sioux. Father's side.
TULLY: Ray, there's been a homicide out in an area known as The Badlands. Indian Reservation.
COOCH: It's not the first. There's been several. And our field office in Rapid City is getting a lot of heat... none of the investigations have turned up jack shit.
TULLY: The main problem is, Ray, these people are extremely distrustful of outsiders, non-Indians. Relations have not been amicable.
COOCH: Different culture. Hard to penetrate. The Indians don't like white cops poking around. And that's why we're in a position where we have to bring in an American Indian agent.
TULLY: With an Indian representative out there, we hope to keep hostilities dormant; this is a COINTELPRO, Selective Operations Unit, and it'll be easier on Agent Couture if you can gain the people's trust and maybe --
RAY: Woh, excuse me, Sir... I see what you're saying... I've got a little Indian blood, that's true. But -- I am not an... an Indian. I can't just go in and --
TULLY: -- your father was part Sioux.
RAY: I didn't know him, Sir. He passed away when I was six.
COOCH: Seven.
