DULANEY: Your Honor -- the prosecution has introduced cocaine as one of the contributing reasons Mr. Marsh died. How it may have been introduced into the household is of vital importance.
JUDGE BURNHAM: Are you able to back up this allegation -- or are you fishing?
DULANEY: I can back it up.
JUDGE BURNHAM: You better. Please answer the question.
JOANNE: I've tried it.
DULANEY: You've tried it? Isn't it true that you've been in and out of Rehab centers for the last four years?
JOANNE: I've been to a few -- yes.
DULANEY: You don't like Miss Lawson much do you?
JOANNE: No.
DULANEY: You don't like her because you were involved with Mr. Marsh before she came along. Isn't that true?
JOANNE: Yes.
DULANEY: You resented the fact that she told you what to do in Mr. Marsh's house?
JOANNE: Yes.
DULANEY: And you resented that he cared for her in a way he once cared for you?
JOANNE: Yes.
DULANEY: --And that Mr. Marsh paid less attention to you?
JOANNE: Yes.
DULANEY: --and that he changed his will?
JOANNE: Yes.
DULANEY: In his previous will Mr. Marsh left you two hundred and fifty thousand dollars -- then he cut you out. Why do you think he did that?
JOANNE: She talked him into it. She wanted everything.
DULANEY: Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a lot of money. That must have made you pretty angry?
JOANNE: Yes.
