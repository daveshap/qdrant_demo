a verb that means inhabiting the desert by large numbers? I want to know if \"conquer the desert\" is the right way to talk about inhabiting desert by large numbers.Also,if there is any other verb that can be used other than \"conquer\" like \"invade\" or \"overrun\".EX:To face the problem of overpopulation,it is necessary to conquer the desert.P.S:A verb that doesn't refer to a negative or militaristic meaning.
