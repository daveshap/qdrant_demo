Recently broke up with my gf of 2 years, how do you stop thinking of all the good memories?
I’m devastated, we both are, but she thinks it’s the best move for her to focus on herself.  I’m awful at letting people go and I’ve faked it for the last couple of weeks but today I just woke up and everything I see reminds me of her and the good times we had.
I’m just lost, everyone tries to give me different advice and what I should do but I don’t even know anymore.  I don’t want to move on but I think it’s best thing that I should do, but I don’t know how I can move on mentally.

EDIT:  Thank you guys so much for commenting and letting me know your experiences.  I’m at work right now but reading each of your advices and own experiences really genuinely put tears in my eyes.  I hope you all can see this edit and know that I appreciate you all.  When I get off work later tonight I’ll reply to everyone of you and thank you but for now this is all I can do. M

I’m still hurting but it definitely helps to know there’s so many people that’s been through what I’m going through right now.  Thank you.
