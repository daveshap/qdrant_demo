My supervisor remembered my mood scale!
I track my moods in my journal each day, from red, orange, yellow, green, and blue for an awesome day. It came up maybe once in a conversation how I track my anxiety levels.

Today was a rough day and my supervisor asked  what kind of day it is. I told her orange leaning towards red, but it really meant a lot that she remembered and wanted to know how to make it better.

Might be minor, but I think it shows how having supportive people around can be so helpful. The day is looking up at least.

Sending good vibes ❤️
