I've been a hypocrite in this sub and I'm sorry
I try to steer others away from suicide and yet, I'm no different. These thoughts just seem to stay in a state of temporary stasis and randomly decide to manifest themselves whenever they feel like it. 

There's a hidden urge to simply hit the eject button in the midst of this all. Everything and nothing begin to lose their value and meaning altogether. Undoing myself would bring upon a much more needed comfort because my comfort doesn't truly seem to lie in this life.

Conversely, if I want to stay aliveâ€¦ I hesitate. I think it over a lot. It works because I am not dead yet. I think therefore I am alive.
