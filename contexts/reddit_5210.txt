Constantly Rejected, Really Low Self-Esteem
I currently work at Wendy's 32-39 hrs/week for $9.15/hr. I also worked at Radio Shack when they were open from 2016-2017. I'm a crew trainer at Wendy's as of right now. I want to get out of Wendy's because it's SO stressful and has really taken a hit on my mental health. I want to find a job somewhere else for a preferred $11, because for all my bills and all the stress I put up with, my takehome of $530-$580 every 2 weeks is just not cutting it for bills and rent. I'm 22 years old and a female, and I just want to find something that will be a better job for me in the long-run, but every place I apply to has rejected me, I've only gotten one interview out of all the places I've applied to, and then never heard back from them. I would love some advice.

I will link a picture to my resume in the comments
