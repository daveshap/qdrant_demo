Anyone else think they come off as rude in social settings because you're too scared to talk, resulting in silence?
Sometimes I just don't know what to say when I talk to people, so I just stay silent. I know people have told me I come off snobby or rude when I don't speak to them, but sometimes I don't know what to say to them or I'm too anxious to talk. I've had people tell me they thought I hated them initially because I wouldn't talk to them. That totally was not the case. 

Does anybody else feel like this?
