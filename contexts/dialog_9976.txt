CHARNIER: It's beautiful.
LA VALLE: It was built in 1917 - and was one of the two heaviest bridges in the world. The arch is still the largest in the world.
CHARNIER: Who financed it?
LA VALLE: Two railroads as part of a connecting railway which provided passage from New England to the South. It was actually the first railroad through New York City.
MARIE: Why is it called Hellgate?
LA VALLE: The river at this point is the most dangerous on the East Coast. Years ago, hundreds of ships went down here.
CHARNIER: If this bridge were in Europe, it would be on every tourist's sight- seeing list.
LA VALLE: Most New Yorkers never notice it - most Americans have never heard of it.
CHARNIER: Look how gracefully they conceived that arch. Like a bowstring. It was built from both ends. With no support in the middle. Beautiful.
LA VALLE: Mmm.
MARIE: Alain is the only man I know who can become as enthusiastic about a bridge as he can about a woman.
CHARNIER: Not any woman, Marie. Just one.
LA VALLE: I'm afraid the rest of Ward's Island isn't nearly as romantic - a pollution plant, a hospital, a training school for garbage men and that area over there, where the old cars are kept, prior to being processed for shipment to, among other places, The Charnier Shipping Company, of Marseilles, France.
MARIE: What is that old building?
LA VALLE: Oh, it's been abandoned for years.
MARIE: What was it?
LA VALLE: It was a crematorium.
MARIE: For garbage?
LA VALLE: For dead bodies.
CHARNIER: Allo... Salvatore...
SAL: Who's this --
CHARNIER: ... Salvatore?...
