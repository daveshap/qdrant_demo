After 5 years, I feel no closer to graduation. I’ve produced an enormous amount of negative data. My PI throws me under the bus to my committee and, without offering me any advice or direction, will be the first one to say, ‘I told you so.’
Hi everyone, I feel so lost. My committee always rips me to shreds. Mostly it’s just one of my committee members, but everyone else silently agrees by not offering counterpoints or helpful suggestions. Worst of all is my PI, who not only agrees with the committee member that is annihilating every last shred of my project without offering possible directions to go, but also goes out of his way to tell me he has felt the same way for months, but wanted to wait until I had a committee meeting for everyone to find out.

I’ve pioneered several technologies in my lab and have acquired a lot of data (nothing really publishable since all of it seems to be negative data [aka a bunch of things don’t have effects]). However, scraping together a publishable unit seems daunting. I don’t want to spend more time here only to publish in a lower tier journal. 

I already have my Masters from when I defended my oral prelim. I don’t have a paper showing the wide range of techniques I have (techniques I was hoping to leverage in finding a career in genetic engineering). However I worry that staying here for 2-2.5 more years will hurt my career prospects.

I feel like I have no feedback. Until it’s too late. I sincerely think I’m not cut out for science or experimental design.

Should I cut my losses and leave with my Masters or is trying for a publication that showcases my technical abilities (even if it’s in a shitty paper In a shitty journal) worth it to get a subpar PhD?
