Potential Scam Company?
I've been in contact and training with a company called "Globe Logistics Co" based allegedly out of Swizterland for a Project Management position.They are having me complete a four week training course which is ludicrously easy. It's entirely definitions based and open notes to the material which I have been sent that week.  They have what appears to be a real [website](http://globelogisticsco.com), but I cant find any other news about them in a basic google search. The website references many other offices across Europe and to doing operations all over the world. Including their new hiring going on for the US. 

When I was contacted by their "Swiss HQ" the number was from Khazakstan, and they claimed that must just be where their international calls get directed through.

The straw that finally broke the camel's back for me was they enlisted me to begin "part-time" work for them by acquiring equipment to be used in their soon to be opened asian office. They want me to figure out how much the electronics will cost. (Specifically Apple products, computers, scanners, printers.) Then they will allegedly provide the money for me to then buy said products on my own credit card.

Has anybody else talked to this company/worked with this company? Theres a lot of little things that have added up to me questioning their legitimacy. 

Tl;dr "Company" is putting me through an insanely easy training program and a series of red flags have led me to believe this is a scam, but I am unsure and could use some outside input.
