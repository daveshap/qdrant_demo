BERNSTEIN: This is practically a high school reunion for us, Jane--I would have sprung for a classier place.
JANE: Anyplace really public, they'd know about it--they know everything at the Committee, Carl--
BERNSTEIN: --you don't really think you're being followed?
JANE: This girlfriend of mine at the Committee, the other day she went back to the D.A. to tell the things the FBI didn't ask her. That night, her boss, he knew what she'd done. They control everything; that's how they know it all.
BERNSTEIN: FBI too?
JANE: You don't believe me? Well, I was working the weekend of the break-in and my God, all the executives were running around like crazy--you had to practically wait in line to use the shredding machine--and when the FBI came to investigate, they never even asked me about it.
BERNSTEIN: If you don't like it down there, why don't you quit?
JANE: I don't know what they'd do to me.
BERNSTEIN: Hey, easy...
JANE: We're a long way from high school, Carl... ...and I'm scared.
