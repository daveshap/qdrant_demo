What should be the sign of the voltage across the inductors while doing circuit analysis? I am not able to understand what should be the sign of the voltage across an inductor while doing circuit analysis. I know the voltage across an inductor is given by -Ldi/dt, when the rate of change of current is increasing,voltage is negative which means its opposing the direction of current and when rate of change current is decreasing,the voltage is positive which means voltage is along the direction of current. But in every book irrespective of the rate of change of current(increasing/decreasing),they are taking the voltage across the inductor to be positive(i.e. v=+Ldi/dt).I dont understand this.I dont think they have applied the same logic here.So would be very helpful if someone could exactly explain whats going on.
