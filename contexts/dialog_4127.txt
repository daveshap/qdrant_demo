AUGUSTO: Norman Cay is not a person. He is an island, George. In the Bahamas. From what they say, it is free and it's Diego's new home.
GEORGE: What?
AUGUSTO: Let us walk. From what I understand, Diego has bought a hundred and sixty acres, a marina, a hotel, and an airstrip.
GEORGE: Motherfucker works fast.
AUGUSTO: The word is that soon he is to be king of the middle empire. He is doing multiple runs right now and using the island as a jump-off point.
GEORGE: He what?
AUGUSTO: Yes. Jack Stevens is already a very busy man. Along with many others. You shouldn't stay away so long.
GEORGE: That's impossible. We can't be up and running. Who's distributing?
