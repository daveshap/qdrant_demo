KORDA: Are you in charge, Roper?
ROPER: Yep.
KORDA: I want a car. Like a four wheel drive. I want it in perfect condition. I want a uniformed cop to drive it up right here. I want him to leave the engine running and walk to the end of the street. Then we'll come out. I don't want any remote control devices in it. I know all the tricks. If it's not in perfect condition, and I mean if its even low on wiper fluid, I'm going to kill somebody and we're gonna start again.
KORDA: I want a plane waiting at the airport. I'll tell them where I want to go when I get there.
ROPER: Is that all?
KORDA: For now that's all.
ROPER: You'll get it. But, Joe, I want you to do something for me. Let me take a look around inside. Make sure everybody's okay.
KORDA: No. You just do shit for me right now.
ROPER: Joe, I'm doing a lot for you. I think you could give me something to cement the deal... One hostage.
KORDA: I'll give you something.
