ARLO: What did I say?
ARLO: Dude in uniform get in your face, you do not shoot your mouth off.
MASON: I need your truck.
ARLO: 
ARLO: No, no, no. You don't need my truck. You need somebody else's truck...
ARLO: ...and a shitload of ice.
MASON: Look, if I don't get this stuff to McGruder, it's goodbye, Andy's Ice Cream, goodbye, Jerome, goodbye, Mon-...
MASON: ...-tana.
ARLO: Wait, wait. You don't believe the dead guy, do...
ARLO: ...ya?
MASON: Yeah, I believe him. He was my friend.
ARLO: For cryin' out loud.
ARLO: Hey, listen! Do you know what I think? I...
ARLO: ...think he was a wacko. And I think that G.I. ninja's a bigger wacko. And I think you're the biggest wack-...
ARLO: ...-o of all, wantin' to be a part of this wacko shit!
MASON: I need your help.
ARLO: You are seriously mistaken if you think you are going anywhere in my...
ARLO: ...truck.
MASON: Then you drive me to McGrud-...
MASON: ...-er.
ARLO: Look...I got two tons of the world's nastiest ice cream sittin' in a truck that should've been retired ten years ago. That shit will be worthless by noon.
ARLO: And if that Elvis shit...
ARLO: ...is as dangerous as you seem to think it is, I'm gettin' my ass as far away from you and it as possible.
ARLO: Peace.
MASON: All right.
ARLO: 
MASON: Wait, wait, wait. Hold up. Hold up. Look.
MASON: You want cash?
MASON: You want cash?
MASON: I got, like, uh....
MASON: I got, uh....
MASON: I got fifty bucks. I'll get more.
MASON: I'll rent the truck from you. You can stay here, you can go. Whatever you want.
ARLO: No.
MASON: All right, then how about this?
ARLO: Hey, you're gonna piss me-- What the hell are you supposed to be...

ARLO: You are not takin' my truck!
