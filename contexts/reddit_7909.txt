Mental cost of publishing papers during PhD.
I wanted to share that our lab deposited two papers in Bioarchive today. I am not the main author in either of those two papers, but I contributed significantly in both papers. We have been trying to publish one of the papers since January 2017. We tried submitting the paper in Nature, Cell, Cell Stem Cell, Nature Genetics, Nature Cell Biology, Nature Communications in that order after getting rejected each time. I have lost hope in publishing papers. For my own project, I have become very worried because my Prof won't allow me to publish in journals with low impact factor. My work is going fine, but getting it published in those high impact factor journals is going to take some miracles. I have seen my colleague struggling everytime her paper got rejected. I think I can't go through the same cycle.
For some unknown reason, my Prof decided to deposit the papers in Bioarchive. Maybe he also got tired of the process and wanted to move on. This has lifted a huge burden for my colleague. I can say she is happy because the research is in public domain. Publishing paper shouldn't be this hard. And if you combine the pressures of being a PhD student with it, it destroys you.
