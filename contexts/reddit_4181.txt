Dating in your 30s is weird...
It's also tough. It's also confusing. You can have a career, financial stability, be subjectively attractive, fit, have enough hobbies to make you a well\-rounded person, be social, put yourself in environments where you'd think you'd meet someone, join all the dating sites and use all the apps... and still, nothing. I'm halfway through my 30s now, and the spot I'm in is where it's like of course I want to meet someone, but at this age, I get easily  exhausted at the thought of putting in a ton of effort only to realize there's usually little to no reward in it pertaining to resolving my dating life. It's almost as if there's more unnecessary stress and less courtesy when all you're trying to be is a human trying to genuinely connect with another human.

This is not being pessimistic either, but just a fact of how eventually dating wears me out easily at this stage. I have friends where the process has been pretty easy, so seeing that doesn't light a fire in me either. One friend of mine who is a girl who never dated in her entire life until two years ago signed up for Match and met a guy within two months. They're living together now and very happy. Another friend of mine married a girl who accidentally messaged him on facebook because he had the same name as a former college friend of hers, and one thing led to another. That sort of easy, effortless strike of luck *never* happens to me haha

I still put myself on dating sites every now and then without expecting much, and always look for opportunities out there in the real world to potentially be introduced to someone new, yet I would be lying if I didn't say there's also those nights where I see that things aren't changing, I get tired by that thought, and really don't care.
