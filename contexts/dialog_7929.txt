ED: I'd seen him in a coffin so many times, I expected him to jump out...
KATHY: Ed, you've got to snap out of this. Bela's dead -- <u>you're not</u>!
ED: I might as well be. I made shitty movies that nobody wanted to see. I blew it. All he wanted was a comeback... that last glory...
KATHY: Well you tried --
ED: I was a fuckin' HACK! I let people recut the movies, cast their relatives... I let Bela down...
REYNOLDS: Mr. Wood?!
ED: Hruphh...?
REYNOLDS: Mr. Wood, this is Mr. Reynolds, your landlord. Could you please open up?
ED: Yeah...?
REYNOLDS: Mr. Wood, you have bounced your third and final rent check.
ED: I'm real sorry. My stockbroker must have transferred the wrong account... C'mon in, I'll write you another one.
REYNOLDS: Hmm, so you're in the picture business?
ED: You could say that --
REYNOLDS: <u>I'm</u> interested in the picture business. My associates and I wish to produce a series of uplifting religious films, on the Apostles. But unfortunately, we don't have enough money.
ED: Raising money is tough.
REYNOLDS: Oh! Our church has the money for one film. We just don't have it for all twelve...
ED: Okay -- you know what you do? You produce a film in a commercially proven genre. And after it's a hit, you take the profits from <u>that</u>, and make the twelve Apostles' movies.
REYNOLDS: Would that work?
ED: Absolutely! You see this script..?
ED: Graverobbers From Outer Space"! It's <u>money in the bank</u>."
REYNOLDS: Graverobbers from <u>what</u>??
ED: From outer space! It's science- fiction. <u>Very</u> big with the kids! If you make this picture, you'll have enough money to finance a HUNDRED religious films! <u>And</u> pay my back rent from the profits.
REYNOLDS: I don't know... this is all a lot to absorb.
ED: It's a guaranteed blockbuster!
REYNOLDS: Um, I understand that this science friction is popular -- but don't the big hits always have big stars?
ED: Yeah, well we've GOT a big star! Bela Lugosi!!
REYNOLDS: <u>Lugosi</u>??! Didn't be pass on?
ED: Yes, but I've got the last footage he ever shot!
REYNOLDS: Just, it doesn't look like very much.
ED: It's plenty! It's the acorn that will grow a great oak. I'll just find a double to finish his scenes, and we'll release it as Bela Lugosi's Final Film""
