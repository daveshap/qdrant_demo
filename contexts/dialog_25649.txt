SHERMIN: Hello...
STAR MAN: I must get to my ship, Mr. Shermin.
SHERMIN: We can't let you do that.
STAR MAN: I don't want to hurt anybody. I just want to go home.
SHERMIN: All the roads into Death Valley are blocked. We'd like to talk to you.
STAR MAN: If I talk to you, I will miss my ship.
SHERMIN: Hold on a minute... Let's take the chance, George.
FOX: No deal.
SHERMIN: I'm afraid we can't let you go.
