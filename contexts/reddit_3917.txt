Worst feeling in the (dating) world: Someone finally getting 'over' you
The texts become shorter...
The conversations become less interesting...
The previously lengthy responses become one worded...
The mystery soon fades & they know your next moves like clockwork. 

And then you find yourself becoming pathetic, looking at your old text messages when you're up at 3 AM simply to try to feel those feels again & harp on what once was. 

Maybe I also miss who I was when we were together.

Clearly I'm the most fun at parties lately, r/dating.
