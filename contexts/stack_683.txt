Installing Lubuntu 17.10 kills my PC I boot Lubuntu install from a USB drive. It detects win7 and I select dual boot option. The PC has two SDD, second one is not formatted. Install proceeds and ask to reboot. It hangs and I must force power off (I waited at least 10 minutes). Now the PC will no longer boot, or even go into the BIOS!!I tried disconnecting the SDD/USB drives. Nothing works, it's dead. At this point I just want to be able to get into the BIOS.Please help.
