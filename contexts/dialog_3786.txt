KAREN: How did you know?
BLADE: Figured they'd send someone after you. Thought I'd wait around and see who showed up.
KAREN: You used me as bait?!
BLADE: It worked, didn't it?
KAREN: But, he could've --
BLADE: He didn't. Get over it.
KAREN: But he's a policeman --
BLADE: He's a familiar. A human who works for the vampires. See this mark?
BLADE: That's a glyph, kind of like a vampire cattle brand. That means Officer Friendly here is someone's property. Any of the other vampire's try to bleed him, they'll have to answer to Friendly's owner -- This glyph belongs to Deacon Frost. We've been tracking him for a while now --
KAREN: Why in God's name would anyone want to work for them?
BLADE: Because they're vampire wanna-bes. If they're loyal, if they prove themselves, then their masters will turn them.
KAREN: And that's a good thing?
BLADE: For some. Live forever, never get old. The ultimate high.
