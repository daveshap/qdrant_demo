ERICA: I mean, what is there to be happy about really? I mean, going to the gym, climbing the StairMaster, eating the yogurt, checking the voice mail. Smoking the low-tar cigarettes, shaving the bikini line. Sometimes I just want something different, you know?

ERICA: Erica.
TIM: Erica. So do you think you and I are alike, Erica?

TIM: I'm not a nice guy.
ERICA: I know. It's okay.
TIM: Yeah?

ERICA: Hay? Yeah? So teach me a lesson.
