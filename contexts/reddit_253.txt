So I like one of my closest friends
I’ve known this one guy for 3 years and he’s become one of my best friends. I like this guy a lot and apparently he likes me too but doesn’t want to ruin our friendship if anything goes wrong. I honestly don’t know what to do...
So if anyone has any advice on what I should do that would be pretty awesome.
