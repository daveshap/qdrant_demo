I learned how to set boundaries and it made me realize how toxic and manipulative my friend/roommate has been towards me.
 Hello,

My current roommate and I used to be inseparable best friends for a couple years, and have been roommates for a long time (close to 5 years). I used to be very naive - I didn't know how to set boundaries, didn't have the confidence to stand up for myself, and was too forgiving. This person is incredibly controlling, bossy, non-empathetic, and borderline narcissistic and I have endured what some other people in my life have titled her behavior as emotional abuse. I have only within the last year or so realized how detrimental this relationship has been to my mental health, self-esteem, and other relationships.

Below, you will find text screenshots of three different situations (only a few of many) that have happened within the last year and you can observe how she acts towards me and vice versa. 

I will also note that one of the biggest fights we have ever had is not captured because I was so upset and distraught that I deleted the entire text conversation and can't find a way to recover it. Summarized, she became enraged when I told her I was going on a date with someone (who is now my SO of almost a year). She told me that I was depressed and lonely, and that I needed to get the idea of being in a relationship out of my head because it wasn't ever going to work out. I had spent two years prior to this being single and working a lot on myself and furthering my career after struggling with anxiety and some depression.

Situation 2: The first night I stayed at my SO's place overnight because I was tired and couldn't safely drive home without my glasses (which I forgot) [https://imgur.com/a/7wl4Oaz](https://imgur.com/a/7wl4Oaz)

Situation 3: I had recently got a full time, salaried position in my career field after working in retail for nearly two grueling years. She was upset that we couldn't ever hang out, even though we lived together, watched TV together, made dinner together, but would never try to make plans with me outside of that. So it's my fault.

I am just so frustrated with myself for being passive and so dismissive of her words and actions over the past and for how long it took me to realize that this relationship takes a massive mental toll on me and is not healthy at all.
