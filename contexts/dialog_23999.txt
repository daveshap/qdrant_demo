MILTON: We've got our best people on it, Mr. Sayer.
MAX: 24-hour tail on Taransky?
MILTON: Shutter bugs camped outside any place he goes, every concierge and maitre d' on the take. But this Simone woman is good.
MAX: Obviously the name isn't real -- she's using an assumed identity, travels under a false name, checks into hotels with an alias. She never stays in the same place two nights in a row. Anything on the satellite photos? What about the fingerprints? What happened when we dusted that hotel suite?
MILTON: Well, we got some of Taransky's fingerprints, a lot of your fingerprints... but none of hers.
MAX: Which means they're significant. Incriminating. Perhaps, criminal. She's hiding her past. She's hiding her past.
MAX: Of course -- no one's that perfect, that pure. You know I had something on Mother Teresa. But then she died and it wasn't worth it anymore. I know how to flush out this Simone -- a tell-all story from her childhood.
MILTON: My God, you've got one?
MAX: I will when you're finished writing it.
MAX: Am I wasting my time with you? When she sues to protect her privacy, she'll have to appear in a public courtroom to do it.
MILTON: Long live the First Amendment.
MAX: Sometimes you have to tell a small lie to get to the bigger truth. As for a photo -- if you can't do it, I know twelve million people who can.
VIKTOR: -- You can't go in there!
ELAINE: -- We have to talk to her, Viktor!
