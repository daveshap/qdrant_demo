Check router for DNS changer virus I want to verify that router was not affected by DNS changer virus. Router provided by local Internet provider, runs custom firmware with web admin which does not contain DNS settings, no telnet/ssh/upnp. Is it possible to verify that it does not configured to use malicious DNS servers? Is it possible to do that just by performing some analysis with DNS queries from inside local network?
