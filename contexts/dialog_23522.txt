VIOLA: I love you, Will, beyond poetry.
WILL: Oh, my love You ran from me before.
VIOLA: You were not dead before. When I thought you dead, I did not care about all the plays that will never come, only that I would never see your face. I saw our end, and it will come.
WILL: You cannot marry Wessex!
VIOLA: If not Wessex the Queen will know the cause and there will be no more Will Shakespeare.
WILL: Noâ€¦no.
VIOLA: But I will go to Wessex as a widow from these vows, as solemn as they are unsanctified.
