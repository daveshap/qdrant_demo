BARTHOLOMEW: Just a minute, Mrs. Lampert -- you'd better give that to me slowly. Who's Adam?
REGGIE: The one who said he was Dyle's brother -- of course I'm sure -- Tex wrote the word 'Dyle' before he died. He's the murderer I tell you -- he's the only one left! You've got to do something!
BARTHOLOMEW: Calm down, Mrs. Lampert -- please. Does he have the money?
REGGIE: No, I do -- it was the stamps on that letter Charles had with him on the train. They were in plain sight all the time, but no one ever bothered looking at the envelope.
BARTHOLOMEW: The envelope -- imagine that. Mrs. Lampert, listen to me -- you're not safe as long as you've got these stamps. Go to the Embassy right away -- wait, I'd better meet you halfway -- it's quicker. Now, let's see -- do you know the center garden at the Palais Royal? -- yes, by the colonnade -- as soon as you can get there. Hurry, Mrs. Lampert.
REGGIE: Yes, I'm leaving now -- goodbye.
