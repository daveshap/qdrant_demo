FLASH: Hey, guys. Check it out-- I saw this dud on the tube last night. He is incredibly cool.
LIZ: I saw him too. He was silly and obnoxious.
ADELE: And Flash isn't?
LIZ: Be nice.
HARRY: Yeah, take pity on the feeble minded.
FLASH: No, no, listen. They're tryin' to say he was in cahoots with this killer--
HARRY: Flash, drop it--
FLASH: -- but they got it all wrong. Any fool can figure it out. Spider-Man nailed this guy!
