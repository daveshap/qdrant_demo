New black Van in South Florida - To insulate or Not? Radiative Cooling effect? I'm not homeless, I'm just frugal and trying to drive a lot less.. maybe I'm adventurous. :) Anyways, I've been working , eating and sleeping out of my new Black van.  The van is brutally hot during the day even in the so called South Florida winter. It's okay though, cause I drive w the windows open and I don't really spend much time in the van during the day if not driving and when I do it's parked at the beach under a tree (NICE).  Anyways, I'm not sure if it's just me or what, but at night the bare black metal that had cooked during the day van, is much colder than my prior highly insulated SUV. Like right now (10pm) it's 73 degrees out side but inside the van the bare metal feels cold.. I'm not complaining at all - I don't mind it.  A few nights ago it was just flat out freezing in the van at midnight and just 6 hours earlier you could fry an egg on the roof. I am wondering, will insulation make my van hotter at night in the summer? I'm not worried about cold as the van will never travel north of Florida in the winter.Is it my imagination that maybe the van getting super hot during the day and maybe something like Radiative cooling might be making my van cooler at night than if it had not gotten so hot?
