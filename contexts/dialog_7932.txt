ED: Those assholes.
KATHY: The poor girl's out of a job.
ED: Yeah... I should give her a call.
ED: I'm really sorry...
VAMPIRA: It's terrible. People won't even return my calls. It's like I don't exist.
ED: I know what <u>that's</u> like. Anyway, I brought a copy of the script. You would play the Ghoul's Wife.""
VAMPIRA: The <u>Ghoul's Wife</u>?! God, I can't believe I'm doing this...
KATHY: You should feel lucky. Ed's the only guy in town who doesn't pass judgment on people.
ED: Hell, if I did, I wouldn't have any friends.
VAMPIRA: Look... would it be possible to make the Ghoul's Wife" a little less prominent
ED: You don't wanna be noticed?
VAMPIRA: Exactly. Hey, how 'bout this -- what if I don't have any lines? I'll do the part mute!
KATHY: Look, it's Dr. Tom. Hey, Dr. Tom!
ED: Who's Dr. Tom?
KATHY: My chiropractor!
