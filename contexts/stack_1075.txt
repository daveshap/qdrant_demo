E: Unable to locate package when I install unetbootin I try to install UNETbootin using the terminal. When I enter the following:sudo apt-get update sudo apt install unetbootin I get this error: E: Unable to locate packageI already tried many things. I hope anyone has a solution for this? I'm using ubuntu 18.10 is it because of this version I get this error? Are there other alternatives then unetbootin.
