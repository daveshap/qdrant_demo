How do i get a job after 1.5 years of unemployment?
I have completed B.E Mechanical on 2018 and have been applying for all jobs related to my field for the past 1.5 years. Got a job as a machine operator a few months back,which is operating hydraulic machines. But that factory didn't employ any safety precautions (they didn't provide any safety gloves or goggles) and also i had to travel 5-6 hours daily for that.Hence i left that and continued job searching.

At this point, i have lost all faith and will as i didn't get any response so far and it's stressing me a lot.Will appreciate any advice to improve my job searching.

During the time of unemployment, i completed training in HVAC and also have knowledge in Solidworks, CATIA and ANSYS.
