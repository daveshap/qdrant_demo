LLOYD: Sucks for you.
HARRY: Who's your partner?
LLOYD: I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
HARRY: Well... Uh...maybe... jeez, how can I say this... you and I could...perhaps ...maybe...uh... partner up?

HARRY: Oh. Sorry. You're right, field trip partner is a big commitment.
LLOYD: I'm kidding! Of course I'll be your partner.
