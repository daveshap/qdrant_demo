Are some people on Reddit just...mean?
I just started being more active on Reddit recently. I posted about something in another sub and have been stupidly watching the up / down votes and wondering why the heck someone would down vote a comment of mine that doesn't need to be down voted. From that perspective, Reddit is definitely the wrong place to be for my anxiety... I know it's not rational but I'm just wondering if this is commonly known.

*Edit:* I did not expect this post to grow as much as it did! Overall - thank you to everyone for your support. I am okay, and I would say my post was moreso an observation and also recognizing that my staring at karma isn't healthy. I'm not taking it *too* seriously but I guess it always boggles my mind when people are assholes. In general. Even though I know it's reality. And yet, there are also truly kind souls, as well.
