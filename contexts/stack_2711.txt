How to Lift an object at constant velocity vertically Let's say there is a Table on the floor . I lift the table up in such a way that it keeps going upwards 5 m/s  (I kept holding the table every instant). I lifted the table for 3 seconds so it reached 15 meter height. Now if I just move my hands from the table it just falls downward from that time. If its velocity was 5 m/s, shouldn't the table go higher until the velocity becomes 0 m/s before the table starts falling down? Did the table really get constant velocity of 5m/s? If not then why? And how can one lift an object at a constant velocity upwards?
