I have been saving up for two months. I finally have enough money to buy myself a box fan.
I'm have electric now so I can charge my phone and then run my computer. ($5 a month) A box fan just seems needed. It's hot as hell here. So I've been saving where I can. It took me two months. This week, if all goes well, I will finally have sine breeze to make living in my tent a little more comfortable. I can't wait!
