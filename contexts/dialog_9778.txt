FLETCH: More cops. I think I gotta go to Utah, Frank.
WALKER: Utah?
FLETCH: Yeah. It's wedged in between Wyoming and Nevada. I'm sure you've seen pictures.
WALKER: What about finding the source?
FLETCH: I have some ideas.
WALKER: Who? Donnie and Marie?
FLETCH: Very possibly. Come on, say yes. I'll buy you a shirt.
WALKER: Go to transportation, get a ticket.
LARRY: My hero.
FLETCH: Nothing to it.
