CARLOS: Whatsamatter with you? Are you crazy?
SETH: Why the fuck, outta all the god forsaken shit holes in Mexico, did you have us rendezvous at that place?
CARLOS: I don't know, one place's as good as another.
SETH: Have you ever been there before?
CARLOS: No, but I passed by it a couple of times. It's out in the middle of nowhere. It seems like a rowdy place, so there wouldn't be a lot of police. And it's open from dusk till dawn. You said meet you in the morning.
SETH: Well, because you picked that place out of a hat, my brother's dead now. And this girl's family's dead.
CARLOS: I'm sorry to hear that. What were they, psychos?
SETH: Did they look like psychos? They were fuckin' vampires. Psychos don't explode when sunlight hits 'em, I don't care how crazy they are.
CARLOS: Oh, Seth, how can I ever make it up to you?
SETH: You can't, but fifteen percent instead of thirty for my stay at El Ray is a good start.
CARLOS: Twenty-eight.
SETH: Jesus Christ, Carlos, my brother's dead and he's not coming back, and it's all your fault. Twenty.
