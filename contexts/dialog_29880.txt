DONNA: Are you going to see James tonight?
LAURA: Why are you suddenly so interested in who I am going to see at night? Nighttime is my time.
DONNA: You're telling me, but only because you never let me in on any of it... you're not going to see Bobby, are you?
LAURA: Maybe.
DONNA: Oh god, Laura.
LAURA: Well, why not?
DONNA: Because Bobby is a loser, you said so yourself. He's a goon. James is the one. He loves you with that lasting love"... "true love"."
LAURA: Yes, James is very sweet. Why don't you get out your violin, Donna?
DONNA: Sweet? God, he's gorgeous.
LAURA: James is very sweet and very gorgeous.
