CLAUDIA: They're all nudes, if I'm not mistaken.
GIULIA: But why all nudes?
GOFFREDO: Because there is no landscape as beautiful as a woman.
GIULIA: And where do you find the models?
GOFFREDO: Oh, there are as many as one wants.
GIULIA: I thought the model was something obsolete nowadays. Didn't you, Claudia?
GOFFREDO: It's strange how anxious women are to display themselves. It's almost a natural inclination.
GIULIA: But how could they pose like that? I couldn't.
GOFFREDO: Why don't you try?
GIULIA: Me... Goffredo, you're mad! He's mad.
