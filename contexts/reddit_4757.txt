I’m always depressed
Sorry not really a confession but I just feel so sad and needed to get this off my chest.

I’m only fifteen but since I was eleven I have had depression and anxiety for months at a time then I would feel better and positive for ages, but then it comes back and I feel like shit everyday, I cry so much over anything for hours. I cut my thighs to try and feel better, now I have urges to cut every time I feel super anxious.

I feel extremely anxious when we go to peoples houses just because of the thought of having to talk to them, I never talk to our family friends because I’m scared of being ridiculed and I just don’t know what to say, mum thinks I’m just being shy, and every time we get home from outings I cry in the car and then cry myself to sleep when I get home. I just cry and hug myself in the fetal position while my breathing is really fast and I pull at my hair, I think it’s anxiety attacks. Now I just isolate myself from any social situation possible, including school, I’m barely passing because my attendance is so bad, I fake sickness to my mum when I’m anxious to get off school.

I have only like four friends at school and I would never want to tell any of them about this and none of my teachers either. I feel like I can’t talk to anyone I feel so alone and worthless. On my birthday a couple days ago I cried all day and slumped around the house because I felt like I wasn’t worth celebrating and wasting all the money my parents spend on me.

I feel like an asshole and I like I just let everyone down. I don’t know what to do but I don’t want to tell anyone because I’m so embarrassed.
