ANDREWS: I haven't changed my mind, Westley, I want you to understand that! I don't like you! I never have! I never will! That's clear enough, isn't it?
KING: You've made that quite evident—with all your threats of annulment. Well, it hasn't bothered me for a minute. Ellie and I got married because we love each other. And she's proving it; as far as I'm concerned there's going to be no annulment.
ANDREWS: You've got a good thing and you're hanging on to it, huh? All right, You win. I'll just have to get used to you. I admit I'm licked. But only because I'm worried. I've had detectives all over the country searching for her. I've seen thousands of photographs. Fortune tellers, nuts, every crank in the country has written me. Haven't slept one night this week. If I don't find her, I'll go crazy.
WESTLEY: might have been able to help if it weren't for you. I've been watched so closely, I—
ANDREWS: Yes. I know. Well, you can help now. I issued a statement yesterday that I've withdrawn my objections. Begging her to come home. I haven't heard from her. Apparently she doesn't trust me.
WESTLEY: Why should she? After all—
ANDREWS: All right. That's why I sent for you. There's a room full of reporters out there. I want you to make a statement—that you've had a talk with me—that we've reached an understanding—that if Ellen comes home, I won't interfere with your marriage. Will you do that?
WESTLEY: If you really mean it, I will.
ANDREWS: Of course I mean it! I don't care whom she's married to— —as long as I can get her back.
