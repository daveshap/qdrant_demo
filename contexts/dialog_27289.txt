CATHERINE: Miriam...
MIRIAM: Shush.
CATHERINE: He creates the obstacles, he decides which games to play.
MIRIAM: I've heard this argument before. It's not happening.
CATHERINE: It could take years for me to get past the barriers he's created.
MIRIAM: If we reverse the feed and bring Edward into your mind, it could be devastating for him. Imagine the shock of suddenly existing in a whole other world.
CATHERINE: I do it all the time!
MIRIAM: Yes, but, you're a willing participant. Picture Edward in a strange place, lost, frightened...
CATHERINE: I'd be there for him.
MIRIAM: And he might blame you for terrifying him. That one moment could erase all you've accomplished. And if that happened, the trust he has in you is gone.
CATHERINE: Okay, okay...
