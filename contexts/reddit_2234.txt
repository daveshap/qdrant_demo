Crazy man promised me admission to Yale today
Yesterday I was in Dunkin' Donuts doing my entire calc unit in one sitting and this man walked in screaming and swearing and wandering around. Eventually he sat next to me and we talked about my math homework and the high school I currently go to. He asked me where I was applying and when I said Yale he said I would be admitted but I shouldn't attend because New Haven is a terrible city. He also said not to ask him how he knows.

Excited for 5pm lol

EDIT 1: Everyone doing remindme is really sweet <3 haha

EDIT 2: I forgot to mention he also said everyone at Yale is an idiot xd

EDIT 3: Got deferred! Guess he’s not a psychic lol. Well looking back he didn’t actually say I would be admitted TODAY so there’s hope for RD!!!

EDIT: Rejected RD, got into Harvard & Columbia & Brown tho, the rest of my top 4
