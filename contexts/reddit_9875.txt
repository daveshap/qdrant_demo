What types of entry-level jobs can I expect to get in student affairs with just a bachelors degree?
I’m currently an undergrad student pursuing a bachelors in Religious Studies. I’m just starting to realize that my heart really lies in student affairs, so I’ve taken up a part time job in the career center at my university.

For financial reasons, I’ve decided that once I graduate I’m going to work for a year. And I’d prefer to get that experience working in student affairs. What types of jobs can I expect to get? 

Side note: After a year of working, I do plan to pursue a Masters in higher ed
