PEGGY: There's something pathetic parked in front of my house.
CHARLIE: Come off it, Peggy. And what do you mean your house? This is my house. I paid for it, I'm still paying for it.
PEGGY: I'm still waiting for the mortgage check.
CHARLIE: I mailed it to you on Wednesday.
PEGGY: Well, today's Saturday and it's still not here.
CHARLIE: Jesus, Peggy. Take it easy. I'm not used to that stuff. You always did the bills. Blame the damn post office.
