openssl vs gpg for file based encryption? Pros vs cons for security? I want to encrypt a tar archive and optionally a block file system (akin to DMG image).  Does anyone know the pros vs cons of encrypting each with OpenSSL vs GPG?I ask because some have stated that the OpenSSL command line is malleable and prone to attack.  Therefore GPG was recommended.  I'm still unclear of the reasons why.  I'm also confused because GPG is asymmetric and it's unclear of this requirement for encrypting a file that only one person needs to decrypt.Your insight and/or pointers appreciated.Nick
