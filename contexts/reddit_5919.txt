Waiter as an Introvert
So I recently took an MBTI test and I was found to be an introvert at 96% (Meaning I was only 4% extroverted). 

I dislike social gatherings as they take away my energy instead of "giving" energy. I really dislike standing out. Etc, etc.

I work at a restaurant as a busboy, but I'm more of a half-server as we get very busy every night. 

I try to talk to customer only when necessary like "Can I clear that plate for you?" or "How's everything going so far?". 

Sometimes, unconsciously, I try to break my introverted-ness and talk to many people in a row (B/c its so busy). This makes me slur my words and to them, it would sound like gibberish. 

How do act "like an extrovert" while being an almost 100%, pure, introvert?

(If the flair is wrong, sorry. Idk what flair to put this under)
