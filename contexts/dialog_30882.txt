DEZERAE: OH MY GAWD!
CARTER: I'm sorry - I didn't think
DEZERAE: A person could get killed round here just for working late
CARTER: I thought you were someone else
DEZERAE: Well I'm glad I'm not them - what are you doing here so late? Come to that, what the hell have you got that for?
CARTER: I thought someone was following me - I - er - I just needed my computer and some things...Listen, I'd like to work from home for a few weeks - is that OK?
DEZERAE: Why don't you take a few weeks off - you're due some holiday time.
CARTER: Sounds good - thank you
DEZERAE: Don't mention it - now can I get back to my accounts, or do you want to fillet me?
