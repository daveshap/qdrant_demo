KIMBALL: No hash browns?
BATEMAN: Not in the mood, I guess.
KIMBALL: But...everyone orders the hash browns here. I mean- it's-have you been here before?
BATEMAN: Yes, of course. The hash browns are delicious. I'm just...not... ordering them.
KIMBALL: Suit yourself, I guess.
KIMBALL: So, the night he disappeared? Any new thoughts on what you did?
BATEMAN: I'm not really sure. I had a shower...and some sorbet?
KIMBALL: I think maybe you've got your dates mixed up.
BATEMAN: But how? Where do you place Paul that night?
KIMBALL: According to his date book, and this was verified by his secretary, he had dinner with...Marcus Halberstam.
BATEMAN: And?
KIMBALL: I've questioned him.
BATEMAN: Marcus?
KIMBALL: Yes. And he denies it. Though at first he couldn't be sure.
BATEMAN: But Marcus denied it?
KIMBALL: Yes.
BATEMAN: Well, does Marcus have an alibi?
KIMBALL: Yes.
BATEMAN: He does? You're sure?
KIMBALL: I checked it out. It's clean.
BATEMAN: Oh. KIMBALL Now where were you?
BATEMAN: Where was Marcus?
KIMBALL: He wasn't with Paul Owen.
BATEMAN: So who was he with?
KIMBALL: He was at Atlantis with Craig McDermott, Frederick Dibble, Harry Newman, George Butner and â€“ - you.
BATEMAN: Oh, right. Of course...We had wanted Paul Owen to come. But he said he had plans...I guess I had dinner with Victoria...the following night.
KIMBALL: Personally I think the guy went a little nutso. Split town for a while. Maybe he did go to London. Sightseeing. Drinking. Whatever. Anyway, I'm pretty sure he'll turn up sooner or later. I mean, to think that one of his friends killed him, for no reason whatsoever would be too ridiculous. Isn't that right, Patrick?
