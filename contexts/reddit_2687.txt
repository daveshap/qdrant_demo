I'd like to work in a field where I have high levels of autonomy and a flexible schedule. I majored in business but I feel that I haven't learned hard skills that can allow me to achieve that. If you could go back and have the opportunity to focus on a major/skill/path, what would you learn?
Hi everybody, I struggled my way and managed to finish my undergrad degree in Business Management recently. However, I really want to focus on learning skills or focus on a path that will allow me to have independence and autonomy. I have researched a few paths but I'd like to hear yall's opinion on this topic. Thank you!
