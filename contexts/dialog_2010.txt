RAY: Okay. So you call 911 and don't leave your name -- even a dumb geezer should know that emergency automatically pulls up your name. How come you make a mistake like that?
MELVIN: How come you're pretending to do cop work -- 'cause I don't think you could find your ass if you were spotted the hole.
RAY: What?
MELVIN: Just move on. No one here killed him.
RAY: Oh, is he dead?
MELVIN: Ask him.
RAY: We will if we can and if we can't, we'll come back and ask you again and again.
