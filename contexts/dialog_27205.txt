MOTHER: It doesn't sound insane, Truman. I swear I see him ten times a week--in a hundred faces. I almost hugged a perfect stranger in the salon last Thursday.
TRUMAN: It was Dad, I swear, dressed like a homeless man. And you know what else was really strange? A businessman and a woman with a little dog appeared from nowhere and forced him onto a bus.
MOTHER: About time they started cleaning up the trash Downtown. We don't want to end up like the rest of the country.
TRUMAN: They never found Dad's body--maybe somehow--
MOTHER: --Darling--
TRUMAN: I'm telling you, if it wasn't him, it was his twin. Did Dad have a brother?
MOTHER: You know he was an only child, like you. I know how bad you feel about what happened--sailing into that storm. But I don't blame you, Truman. I never have.
