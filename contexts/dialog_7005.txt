FRIDA: I'm cleaning my stove.
JENNIFER: You scared the shit out of me. I thought you were killing yourself.
FRIDA: I tried to kill myself -- earlier. It doesn't work. I think I need silver bullets. So I got depressed and when I'm depressed I clean.
JENNIFER: You'll get through this. You were fine for over three weeks.
FRIDA: I'm just afraid I'll hurt Peter. I think I love him.
JENNIFER: Remember what Madame Sconce said. If you love him he'll be fine.
FRIDA: But how do I know if I really love Peter? And if he really loves me?
JENNIFER: I guess you'll find out.
FRIDA: No. I can't take that chance. I'd rather kill myself.
JENNIFER: No. I won't let you do that.
FRIDA: The werewolf always dies at the end. Didn't you see American Werewolf in London?""
JENNIFER: I think George knows.
FRIDA: About Mark? Carlton?
JENNIFER: About Benito.
FRIDA: Did I kill a guy named Benito?
JENNIFER: No, he's the guy I'm having an affair with.
FRIDA: I thought you and George were getting married.
JENNIFER: We were -- I was just so tempted... It was sort of a test. I think after sleeping with Benito I know I want to be with George. But now George knows about Benito and he doesn't want to be with me!
FRIDA: I wish I only had your problems.
JENNIFER: Sorry -- I shouldn't go on about myself at a time like this. Are you sure you're going to be okay?
FRIDA: Yes, just check on me once a day for the next three days. Then the PMS should be over.
