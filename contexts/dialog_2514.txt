STEPHEN: Hey, what are you doing here?
BRIAN: Just... Just wanted to say hello...
STEPHEN: So hello.
STEPHEN: Well, long as you're here you can help clean up a little. I've got a guy coming to look at this in a few minutes.
BRIAN: You're selling dad's boat?
STEPHEN: Yeah, it's just another memory in my life right now. And I got way too many of them...
BRIAN: I really should get back. There's... there's something I'm supposed to do.
STEPHEN: Yeah? What have you got to do? Look at you. Look at your face. All the things you must be thinking. Man, you must really hate my guts. Well, you know what? It's okay.
BRIAN: Look, Stephen, maybe we can talk about this some other --
STEPHEN: -- Okay, so you don't like me. You don't like everything I've done. What, because I wasn't such a genius the way I raised you? Jesus Christ, dad was gone, what was I supposed to do? You tell me, what the fuck was I supposed to do?!
BRIAN: It's okay, Stephen, I --
STEPHEN: -- I tried, y'know? Helen's right. I don't have all the answers, but goddamn it, I've got some. Look, you're gonna do what you have to, and maybe I shouldn't have gotten in the way. I'm your brother, not your father. Go on. You gotta go somewhere? Go...
BRIAN: I saw it.
STEPHEN: Saw what?
BRIAN: When dad died, I saw another fire...
STEPHEN: Everybody did.
BRIAN: I saw it before it got them. I tried to yell, but... He asked me to look out for him. And I didn't do it. I let him die.
STEPHEN: ...Jesus, you been carrying that around for twenty years? For christ's sake, you were seven years old! You think he could have heard you in there?
BRIAN: I hate him so much sometimes, Stephen. You don't know how hard it was for me to put that uniform on...
STEPHEN: Maybe I do. ...What a fuckin' mess, huh? People can change Brian.
BRIAN: Sometimes right when you're looking at them.
BRIAN: Oh God, Stephen, what's going on with you?
STEPHEN: I don't know, Brian... I don't know...
BRIAN: -- Stephen, wait a minute. I gotta talk to you. It's Adcox, he's --
STEPHEN: -- What are you doing here?
BRIAN: I saw Adcox's back! I saw the burn! I put it there! Jesus Christ, Stephen, he's been killing people!
STEPHEN: I know.
BRIAN: How do you know?
STEPHEN: I knew when you came looking for the chemicals. Looking for me.
BRIAN: -- What were they doing there?
STEPHEN: They were for the fucking boat, Brian.
GRINDLE: We gotta roll, Stevie...
STEPHEN: I'll be there.
GRINDLE: They're waitin' man.
STEPHEN: I'll be there, goddamn it!
STEPHEN: Anything else?
BRIAN: What are we going to do about this?
STEPHEN: I'll handle it.
BRIAN: We gotta go to Rimgale, Stephen.
STEPHEN: I'm his Lt. He's my responsibility. I'll handle it. Me.
