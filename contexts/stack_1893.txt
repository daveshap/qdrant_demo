What is the smile that occurs when a kid asks you for something you really know but you can't explain to them? Say a kid reads a book contains a word \"Fourier transform\then they ask their father who is a mathematician. He really understands what it is, but he sticks for finding words that his child can understand. All he can do is to have a small smile and say things like \"you will know when you grow up\" or \"this is really hard to explain to you\".What are the words that better capture that smile?Example: ________ly, he says to his curious child: \"it is really hard for me to explain it to you. But if you really want to know that, don't give up. I'll always love you.\"
