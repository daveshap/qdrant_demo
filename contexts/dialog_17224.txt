HAWKEYE: Finest kind. We're training Ho-Jon to be a bartender. Join us?
DUKE: But first will you please kindly shut the goddam door?
FRANK: I don't drink intoxicants.
HAWKEYE: Christ Almighty, I think he means it!
DUKE: We been had.
FRANK: I don't believe it's right for you to involve a boy who's not seventeen years old yet...
DUKE: The door, Frank, the door! Where you from anyhow, Alaska?
FRANK: Wisconsin.
DUKE: Same general idea.
HO-JON: Officer all sleep now, yes? And I go wash clothes.
HAWKEYE: Right, Ho-Jon. See you later.
FRANK: So long, Ho-Jon.
