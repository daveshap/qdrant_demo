Pulmonary Function Test - 1, HISTORY:, Smoking history 50-pack years of smoking.,INDICATION:, Dyspnea.,PROCEDURE:, FVC was 59%. FEV1 was 45%. FEV1/FVC ratio was 52%. The predicted was 67%. FEF 25/75% was 22%, improved about 400-cc, which represents 89% improvement with bronchodilator. SVC was 91%. Inspiratory capacity was 70%. Residual volume was 225% of its predicted. Total lung capacity was 128%. ,IMPRESSION:,1. Moderate obstructive lung disease with some improvement with bronchodilator indicating bronchospastic element.,2. Probably there is some restrictive element because of fibrosis. The reason for that is that the inspiratory capacity was limited and the total lung capacity did not increase to the same extent as the residual volume and expiratory residual volume.,3. Diffusion capacity was not measured. The flow volume loop was consistent with the above.,cardiovascular / pulmonary, pulmonary function test, diffusion capacity, dyspnea, fef, fev1, fev1/fvc ratio, fvc, pft, residual volume, svc, smoking history, bronchodilator, bronchospastic, fibrosis, inspiratory capacity, lung capacity, obstructive lung disease, pulmonary function,
