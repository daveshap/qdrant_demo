GRACE: There. All done. Lift me down.
JOHN: What?
GRACE: Lift me down.
GRACE: You can let go of me now. I'm safe. How do they look.
JOHN: Like you.
GRACE: Beautiful?
JOHN: Like they're made of polyester.
GRACE: I like them. I was sick of looking at this room. I think they add a little life.
JOHN: Nothing like a little liveliness.
GRACE: No more drapes to hang. Now what should we do?
JOHN: I have ideas.
GRACE: Such as?
JOHN: All right, Grace. No more games.
GRACE: Games?
JOHN: You flirt with me, then you run cold. You lead me on, then slap me down. I don't go for being jerked around.
GRACE: Really? And what game did you want to play? You carry my box for me, and I fall into bed with you?
JOHN: I think I can find my own way back to into town.
GRACE: Maybe I like to find out about a man first. Maybe I like to know what he's made of.
JOHN: I'm just flesh and blood, baby. That and a few memories of bad women; just like most guys. But you already know that. You read my fortune. Thanks for the lemonade.
GRACE: You never did answer my question.
JOHN: Still playing?
GRACE: That's not an answer. What is it you want?
JOHN: You know what I want.
GRACE: Maybe I just want to hear you say it.
