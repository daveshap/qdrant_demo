Usb to hdmi cable that works for ubuntu 17.10? This may seem like a repeated question, but since my computer is a bit old I kind of want to get a usb to hdmi cable.  I understand that usb 3.0 is backwards compatible so my usb 1.1 could pick it up (as evidenced from the one time I got a usb 3.0 dvd drive) but just so I get the correct one what would you reccommend that would work good with Ubuntu?  And if I get it to work, is there any procedures I should go through?  Thanks and regards,Thomas
