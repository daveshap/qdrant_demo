GAIL: John Ultramalensky, right?
FLETCH: Right.
GAIL: God, I haven't seen you since the wedding.
FLETCH: Gee, I must have been shit-faced at your wedding, I don't --
GAIL: Not mine, stupid. Yours.
FLETCH: What are you doing here?
GAIL: I couldn't sit home and play the mournful widow anymore, and the police didn't need me, so I tried watching a Lakers game on TV, but the announcer talked to fast and I couldn't understand a lot of what was happening, so I figured if I came down here maybe you could explain the rules to me, and besides, I missed you.
FLETCH: No problem.
