Entering Germany before granting of residence permit I am a US citizen, trying to move to Germany (Berlin). I have found a job in Berlin and with the company, am applying for a residence permit. Since I am a software developer with no negative history, I think it's fairly reasonable to assume that it will be granted.However, I will be arriving in Berlin before that process completes and possibly, before the application is made. I will not start with the new job until authorized to do so, as I don't intend to work illegally. I have rented an apartment (through a reputable site online) for 6 months.What do I tell the border officers to both be as honest as possible and not get denied entry? I do plan on doing tourist activities while I wait for the process to complete. I am concerned that they will look at my amount of luggage and desire for a longer stay without proof of visa application and deny me entry. I do currently have a return flight for about 60 days after entry and significant financial resources.
