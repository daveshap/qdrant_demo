they lied to me
we all worked SO HARD in high school, always to be told to take the sidelines at rewarding events because “you’ll get your chance when you’re a senior” and “your time will come.” Obviously no one could’ve predicted this but I still feel lied to and cheated nonetheless. We’ve had to watch every single class above ours get rewarded in so many ways and it sucks that we get nothing. 

Class of 2020, we deserve everything that was planned for us and more. We won’t even get to say goodbye to our classmates or get our yearbooks signed or walk across the stage that we worked 12 years to get to. Fuck this #RIPClassof2020

EDIT: i didn’t expect this to blow up so much so i wanna clarify some stuff. this isn’t anyone’s fault and i’m NOT saying we should bring these events back. i am gladly staying home because it needs to be done. i also acknowledge that this is a first world problem and i am privileged that this my biggest worry and nothing worse. it is what it is, i am just saying it for those of us who are sad that it’s ok to be sad.
