Working for a 'hip' company
My current situation is that I am horribly underpaid and it is time for me to leave my current job. It sucks because i do like my team, the work and even my boss (minus the pay part) but after 13 years, it's time to go. My current place is an old company and it is pretty bland around here. They try to do some fun stuff but there is still this old school mentality. 

In my large metro area, there are several cool looking company's with some fun looking office environments. People wearing t-shirts and jeans, free snacks, Nerf guns, etc. While all of that looks cool and fun to me (age wise, i am an older-Millennial) i cant help but think its just a facade to cover up insane hours and crap pay. 

What are your experiences with places like this? All i want is decent compinstation and work-life balance.
