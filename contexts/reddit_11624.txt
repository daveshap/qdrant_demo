I feel I'm losing touch with friends and depression is getting worse.
I have someone who I call my best and only realy life friend. I don't know anymore. It's starting to seem he only hangs out with me for my things. It's shitty. It wasn't like this ~6 months ago. Anytime I tell him I got something new he'll ask to come over and he will do nothing but pay attention to that. I got a PS4 for Christmas and told him about it. "I should come over!" Well, the PS4 got the blue light of death (Odds of that, right?). I told him that and right away he texted back "I can't come over I'm busy." Fuck you then. 

Now anytime I text him if he wants to visit or he can come over it's "You can't sleep over. Mom has work." "Im busy sorry man." "I'm not feeling good maybe tomorrow." He's my only friend but he has to go. Without him I feel lonely as fuck. 

I'm not talking to some of my skype friends too much either. I met this guy my age from Europe over a year ago. I learned so much from him that has to do with computers. We haven't been talking to eachother much of lately I don't want to lose him either. I met another guy on skype around 8 months ago. We live 5 hours away from each other. We made plans to see eachother sometime when either one of us gets our license. We have a lot of the same interests. Hes my hope for a new friend. I hope we can meet one day.

During summer my depression wasn't that bad but some events that happened at the end of summer worsened it and it's getting worse. I'm getting bad grades. I regained most of the weight I lost during the summer. All I do is sit around and tune everybody out. I put on my music or play video games and do nothing productive. I feel like a piece of shit everyday. I feel like crying myself to sleep everynight. I want to get better but I don't want to tell my parents because I doubt they would care.
