LOUISE'S VOICE: Chief? Mike said a young girl answered the door.
TALLEY: Did he say if she was shooting at him?
LOUISE'S VOICE: He didn't say.
TALLEY: Then we don't know if she's part of this or not. Mickey, you up?
MIKKELSON'S VOICE: We're out two minutes, me and Dreyer.
TALLEY: Mike found a red pickup abandoned on Flanders. You see it?
MIKKELSON'S VOICE: It's right in front of us.
TALLEY: Run a DMV on the plate for the owner's name.
LOUISE'S VOICE: I pulled Mickey and Dreyer off the minimart.
TALLEY: Jesus Christ, Louise, we can't leave a crime scene like that. Put a unit out there.
LOUISE'S VOICE: We only have eight officers on duty, Chief.
TALLEY: That's not enough.
LOUISE: What's that, Chief? Say again.
TALLEY: Get everyone out here. Then call the Sheriffs. Tell them we have a possible hostage situation.
KEVIN: We could've gone out the back! You didn't have to shoot!
DENNIS: Stop it! They found the truck, Kev! They're already behind us!
KEVIN: We should give up. All we're doing is making it worse.
