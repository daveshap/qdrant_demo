My first day is tomorrow!
Tomorrow will be my first day as an HR Technician for my cityâ€™s community service board. I like to come in prepared 

can you give me suggestions on what to bring my first day and what questions to ask?

My supervisor called and told me on Monday to come in between 8:30-8:35 am and I will be doing training on the computer most of the day. The following day we would go over benefits and  other employee preparation things. 

Any tips on how to make a good first impression besides my outfit?
