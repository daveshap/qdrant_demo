Unpaid trial period for a job I might not even get - Is this a waste of my time?
Hi, all. I lost my job due to COVID and job searching has been a bit of a nightmare since. I work in a rather niche tech field and usually land interview after interview, but now I can’t get a prospective employer to even email me back. I interviewed with a company that seemed like it could be a good fit, but they are requiring an unpaid “trial period” (essentially a working interview) that could last several weeks. I should reiterate, this is a successful company with a good reputation. 

If I get the job after, I get a solid salary and benefits, if I don’t, it was a ROYAL waste of my life. Under any other circumstance, I wouldn’t even consider this. But times are tough and I’m willing to make some sacrifices. The more I think about it, I fail to see how this is even remotely fair to me. I’d much rather work for an employer who trusts my experience, references, and abilities right from the get-go. This trial sends a message of distrust - Especially since it isn’t paid. I just feel guilty for even considering not working towards a job in this economy - But being taken advantage of is not cool either. 

What would you do in this scenario?
