So many bodies..
Hello its @Fluffabug F19, I recently got into a bit of an argument with my new friend/soon to be Fuckbuddy
    We've taken our new friendship into the sexual realm which was what we've both been wanting, last night we were playing 21 questions and I obviously asked him what his body count was and he was hesitant. He proceeded to say it's pretty high, again I asked him what it was and he says 20+... Um excuse me 👀. I was so taken back of course. Coming from a VIRGIN yes a virgin this really shocked me, I didn't know what to say or feel to be honest. I knew he was experienced but not that much !! Shit I thought it was like 5-8 maybe even 10 but not that high. We talked this over and told each other how we felt and everything is well and dealt with between us now but here's the thing... I don't know how to feel? On I've hand I feel like another number on a sex list when giving away my first time. (Additional info- I've never dated, had my first kiss, nothing I mean literally nothing man.) So giving him my v card away is a huge deal for me. 
On the other I don't really care because it's his sex life and he's allowed to do whatever he pleases.  I'm emotionally constipated and I don't know how to make it come out 😅. My question, what would you do in my shoes?  A virgin willing to give away to him until she finds out his body count? Please help any advice will do, Thank you 😅 🙏🏻✨
