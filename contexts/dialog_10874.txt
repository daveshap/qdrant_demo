VENKMAN: It's Peter, Egon. I've got a problem.
SPENGLER: What is it?
VENKMAN: I'm with Dana Barrett and she's floating three feet off the bed.
SPENGLER: Does she want to be?
VENKMAN: I don't think so. It's more of that Gozer thing. She says she's the Gatekeeper. Does that make any sense to you?
SPENGLER: Some. I just met the Keymaster. He's here with me now. Venkman? Are you there?
VENKMAN: Yeah, yeah. I was just thinking. It probably wouldn't be a good idea for them to get together at this point.
SPENGLER: I agree.
VENKMAN: You have to keep him there. Do whatever you have to, but don't let him leave, He could be very dangerous.
SPENGLER: All right. I'll try.
VENKMAN: I'll spend the night here and get back first thing in the morning.
SPENGLER: All right, Peter. Good night.
JANINE: Egon, there's something very strange about that man. I'm very psychic usually and right now I have this terrible feeling that something awful is going to happen to you. I'm afraid you're going to die.
SPENGLER: Die in what sense?
JANINE: In the physical sense.
SPENGLER: I don't care. I see us as tiny parts of a vast organism, like two bacteria living on a rotting speck of dust floating in an infinite void.
JANINE: That's so romantic.
