NIXON: Hunt? Howard Hunt?
EHRLICHMAN: He left his White House phone number in his hotel room.
HALDEMAN: He works for Colson. He used him on the Pentagon Papers. We're trying to figure out when he officially stopped being a White House consultant. After the arrest he dumped his wiretapping stuff into his White House safe.
NIXON: Howard Hunt is working for the White House? No shit! This is goddamn Disneyland! Since when?
