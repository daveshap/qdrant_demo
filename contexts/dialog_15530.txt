TITCH: Sir Ergo? ... My honorable Lord Ergo? ...
ERGO: First, you desert me, and now you mock me. Go back to your one-eyed friend.
ERGO: What? Now you poke me in the nose as well?
TITCH: I don't think it's working.
ERGO: Not working? This nose? This nose works day and night. This nose has never loafed an hour in its life. This nose ... What? Impossible. This nose asleep while venison fills the air? Where is it, boy? Tell me where it is and I forgive you everything.
TITCH: It's right behind you.
ERGO: A venison pie as big as a house.
CYCLOPS: A small house.
ERGO: And what do you think a small person lives in, you one-eyed fool? Leaving me here to mope while you and the boy were arranging my assassination.
TITCH: We meant only to please you.
ERGO: And do you think I'm not going to eat myself to death this very night? Huh?
ERGO: Look at its beauty. Look at its grace.
TORQUIL: Look at its insides.
ERGO: No! Not yet! Let me hug it and kiss it a little. Let me run my fingers over its lovely skin. Let me climb to the top and sing to it.
