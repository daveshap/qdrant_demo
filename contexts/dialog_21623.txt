BARRY: I'm a nice and reasonable man. I didn't do anything wrong. Please don't make me hurt you. And I'm telling you: that if you ever hurt me or if you hurt someone that I love.....I will hurt you many, many, many times over.....because it's not right to take people's trust.
DEAN: You came all the way from Los Angeles to tell me that?
BARRY: Yes I did.
BARRY: Can we agree that that is that?
DEAN: That's that.
BARRY: Thank you.
