STANLEY: One thing that has been troubling me. That lamp at the diner. Do you think they were working on it for esthetic reasons or was their work due to faulty wiring?
DESMOND: Faulty wiring.
STANLEY: Esthetics are subjective, aren't they, Agent Desmond? I'm Sam Stanley. If you ever need me.
DESMOND: Thanks, Sam, for the good work. You have a good eye for detail.
STANLEY: We do notice things, don't we, Agent Desmond? Are you going back to the trailer park for the Blue rose?
