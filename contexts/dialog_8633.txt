JOEL: I'm sorry.
CLEMENTINE: Why?
JOEL: Why what?
CLEMENTINE: Why are you sorry? I just said hi.
JOEL: No, I didn't know if you were talking to me, so...
CLEMENTINE: Really?
JOEL: Well, I didn't want to assume.
CLEMENTINE: Aw, c'mon, live dangerously. Take the leap and assume someone is talking to you in an otherwise empty car.
JOEL: Anyway. Sorry. Hi.
CLEMENTINE: It's okay if I sit closer? So I don't have to scream. Not that I don't need to scream sometimes, believe me. But I don't want to bug you if you're trying to write or something.
JOEL: No, I mean, I don't know. I can't really think of much to say probably.
CLEMENTINE: Oh. So...
JOEL: I mean, it's okay if you want to sit down here. I didn't mean to --
CLEMENTINE: No, I don't want to bug you if you're trying to --
JOEL: It's okay, really.
CLEMENTINE: Just, you know, to chat a little, maybe. I have a long trip ahead of me. How far are you going? On the train, I mean, of course.
JOEL: Rockville Center.
CLEMENTINE: Get out! Me too! What are the odds?
JOEL: The weirder part is I think actually I recognize you. I thought that earlier in the diner. That's why I was looking at you. You work at Borders, right?
CLEMENTINE: Ucch, really? You're kidding. God. Bizarre small world, huh? Yeah, that's me: book slave there for, like, five years now.
JOEL: Really? Because --
CLEMENTINE: Jesus, is it five years? I gotta quit right now.
JOEL: -- because I go there all the time. I don't think I ever saw you before.
CLEMENTINE: Well, I'm there. I hide in the back as much as is humanly possible. You have a cell phone? I need to quit right this minute. I'll call in dead.
JOEL: I don't have one.
CLEMENTINE: I'll go on the dole. Like my daddy before me.
JOEL: I noticed your hair. I guess it made an impression on me, that's why I was pretty sure I recognized you.
CLEMENTINE: Ah, the hair. Blue, right? It's called Blue Ruin. The color. Snappy name, huh?
JOEL: I like it.
CLEMENTINE: Blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were wondering.
JOEL: Yeah. Tom Waits says it in --
CLEMENTINE: Exactly! Tom Waits. Which song?
JOEL: I can't remember.
CLEMENTINE: Anyway, this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names. Red Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution. That'd be a job, coming up with those names. How do you get a job like that? That's what I'll do. Fuck the dole.
JOEL: I don't really know how --
CLEMENTINE: Purple Haze, Pink Eraser.
JOEL: You think that could possibly be a full time job? How many hair colors could there be?
CLEMENTINE: Someone's got that job. Agent Orange! I came up with that one. Anyway, there are endless color possibilities and I'd be great at it.
JOEL: I'm sure you would.
CLEMENTINE: My writing career! Your hair written by Clementine Kruczynski. The Tom Waits album is Rain Dogs.
JOEL: You sure? That doesn't sound --
CLEMENTINE: I think. Anyway, I've tried all their colors. More than once. I'm getting too old for this. But it keeps me from having to develop an actual personality. I apply my personality in a paste. You?
JOEL: Oh, I doubt that's the case.
CLEMENTINE: Well, you don't know me, so... you don't know, do you?
JOEL: Sorry. I was just trying to be nice.
CLEMENTINE: Yeah, I got it.
CLEMENTINE: My name's Clementine, by the way.
JOEL: I'm Joel.
CLEMENTINE: No jokes about my name? Oh, you wouldn't do that; you're trying to be nice.
JOEL: I don't know any jokes about your name.
CLEMENTINE: Huckleberry Hound?
JOEL: I don't know what that means.
CLEMENTINE: Huckleberry Hound! What, are you nuts?
JOEL: I'm not nuts.
CLEMENTINE: Oh my darlin', oh my darlin', oh my darlin' Clementine? No?
JOEL: Sorry. It's a pretty name, though. It means merciful"
CLEMENTINE: Yeah. Although it hardly fits. I'm a vindictive little bitch, truth be told.
JOEL: See, I wouldn't think that about you.
CLEMENTINE: Why wouldn't you think that about me?
JOEL: Oh. I don't know. I was just... I don't know. I was... You seemed nice, so --
CLEMENTINE: Now I'm nice? Don't you know any other adjectives? There's careless and snotty and overbearing and argumentative... mumpish.
JOEL: Well, anyway... Sorry.
