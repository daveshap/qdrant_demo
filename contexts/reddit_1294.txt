Anybody else feel like they are addicted to rewatching old comedies because the familiarity of it soothes their anxiety?
I definitely feel like rewatching episodes of Brooklyn Nine-Nine and The Office soothe my anxiety. And I definitely feel like I use these shoes as a way of distracting myself from the anxiety. I feel itâ€™s because the shows are so familiar to me, and I love the characters so much that they comfort me. 

I even went through a stage where I would finish B99 and then just click right back onto episode one. 

Can anyone explain why I might do this? Does anyone else do the same?
