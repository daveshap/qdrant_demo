BRENT: Well, I assume you let him kiss you?
JODY: Well yeah. Of course. Everyone kisses.
BRENT: I'm not criticizing. _ Did you two get any further?
JODY: A little.
BRENT: How much further?
JODY: Daddy! I DON'T THINK THIS IS ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS!
BRENT: I wouldn't ask if I didn't have to.
JODY: Not much further.
BRENT: You never went, uh, all the way?
