SHELDRAKE: Where are you going, Baxter?
BUD: Well, I don't want to intrude -- and I thought -- since it's all straightened out anyway --
SHELDRAKE: I'm not through with you yet.
BUD: Yes, sir.
SHELDRAKE: The reason I called is -- I won't be home for dinner tonight. The branch manager from Kansas City is in town -- I'm taking him to the theatre Music Man, what else? No, don't wait up for me -- 'bye, darling. Tell me something, Baxter -- have you seen Music Man?
BUD: Not yet. But I hear it's one swell show.
SHELDRAKE: How would you like to go tonight?
BUD: You mean -- you and me? I thought you were taking the branch manager from Kansas City --
SHELDRAKE: I made other plans. You can have both tickets.
BUD: Well, that's very kind of you -- only I'm not feeling well -- you see, I have this cold -- and I thought I'd go straight home.
SHELDRAKE: Baxter, you're not reading me. I told you I have plans.
BUD: So do I -- I'm going to take four aspirins and get into bed -- so you better give the tickets to somebody else --
SHELDRAKE: I'm not just giving those tickets, Baxter -- I want to swap them.
BUD: Swap them? For what?
SHELDRAKE: It also says here -- that you are alert, astute, and quite imaginative --
BUD: Oh? Oh!
BUD: This?
SHELDRAKE: That's good thinking, Baxter. Next month there's going to be a shift in personnel around here -- and as far as I'm concerned, you're executive material.
BUD: I am?
SHELDRAKE: Now put down the key -- -- and put down the address.
