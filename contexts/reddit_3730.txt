A few things to consider if you’re trying to step your game up.
**Cooking.**

I’m definitely not a master chef, but women I have over seem to like it when I cook for them! It’s also loads of fun to have them involved in making the dish. I make sure to ask for feedback when I’m adding spices or ingredients, and I like to have them help out with chopping things up or other such things — that way the dish isn’t just mine, but theirs too. 


**Wine.** 

A nice wine selection never hurts. It’s a good way to take the edge off of any initial awkwardness if you’re just meeting them, y’know?


**Scents.**

If you’re bringing someone to your place for the first time, it’s good to have a pleasant smell to greet them when they walk in. I like to have little jars of spices and potpourri, as well as scented candles.


**Having a space of conversation starters.**

I like to make my room easy to comment on. This can range from having books on the nightstand, instruments laying out in conspicuous places, posters, that sort of thing. (Of course, I keep it clean and smelling nice too, but that’s a given.)


**A weighted blanket.**

This might sound corny, but it’s frighteningly effective — I have a weighted blanket, and I like to offer people a chance to try it out, usually after a glass of wine or two. I don’t think I need to explain this one.


That’s all! Hope this helps. :)
