PINTEL: What?
ELIZABETH: Parlay! I invoke the right of parlay! According to the Code of the Brethern, set down by the pirates Morgan and Bartholomew, you must take me to your Captain!
PINTEL: I know the code.
ELIZABETH: If an adversary demands parlay, you can do them no harm until the parlay is complete.
PINTEL: It would appear, so do you.
