KILLAINE: Down below's Stanley Park. On the other side of the trees, there's a beach. You can see it. Steveston's over there. Coast Guard station. There's the Yacht Club, and beyond it, the docks. The over on the other side of the inlet, there's Grouse Mountain. It's about 4000 feet high. There's a restaurant on top of it. Very nice restaurant. I'm sorry we couldn't have met in pleasanter circumstances, Miss Mayfield.
BETTY: We wouldn't have met at all.
KILLAINE: True. I was a bit irritable last night. I apologize.
BETTY: You were a galahad, compared to some cops I've known.
KILLAINE: You've had dealings with the police before?
BETTY: Who hasn't--one way or another?
KILLAINE: But not in the investigation of a major crime, I hope.
BETTY: Is it a crime?
KILLAINE: We're 98 per cent certain Mitchell was murdered. There are a lot of reasons. Was he very drunk when you last saw him?
BETTY: You were there when I last saw him.
KILLAINE: I'd like to believe that. It's not too easy.
