FLAEMMCHEN: Moreover...
PREYSING: Moreover...
PREYSING: Do you work in Justice Zinnowitz' office?
FLAEMMCHEN: No -- only occasional jobs.
PREYSING: Tired?
FLAEMMCHEN: You pay me.
PREYSING: You're a very unusual stenographer --
FLAEMMCHEN: Moreover...
PREYSING: Moreover...
FLAEMMCHEN: I don't see why it's unusual for a stenographer to be pretty -- if she does her work well, -- seems so silly. I don't know why they don't like girls like me in offices. Personally, I hate offices -- I'd much rather be in the movies.
PREYSING: Movies?
FLAEMMCHEN: Yes, I photograph very well. Look --
PREYSING: What is this?
FLAEMMCHEN: I got ten marks for that.
PREYSING: You...
FLAEMMCHEN: Me.
PREYSING: You...
FLAEMMCHEN: Moreover...
PREYSING: What?
FLAEMMCHEN: Only in mutual advantages -- moreover.
PREYSING: What brown hands you have.
FLAEMMCHEN: That's from skiing.
PREYSING: Skiing?
FLAEMMCHEN: Yes... A man I know took me to Switzerland last month...
PREYSING: A man? -- To Switzerland? -- That must have been nice -- for him.
FLAEMMCHEN: Only in mutual advantages -- moreover...
PREYSING: Moreover... He was a lucky man -- that man.
FLAEMMCHEN: Perhaps.
PREYSING: Don't misunderstand me. I'm a married man -- with grownup daughters. Uh --
FLAEMMCHEN: Moreover -- Do you mind if I smoke? I went to Florence once, too.
PREYSING: With the same friend?
FLAEMMCHEN: No.
PREYSING: Moreover, the possibility of the successful termination of negotiations now pending with the Manchester Cotton Company...
FLAEMMCHEN: Not too quickly.
PREYSING: What?
FLAEMMCHEN: You're a little too fast.
PREYSING: Can't you understand me?
FLAEMMCHEN: I understand you perfectly.
PREYSING: Have you got it now?
FLAEMMCHEN: Cotton Company --
PREYSING: Should throw a great weight into the balance...
FLAEMMCHEN: ...weight into the balance...
