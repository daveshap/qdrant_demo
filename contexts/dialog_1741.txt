LISA: How close are you?
MILO: What?
LISA: He's got 12 satellites up. He's got dishes on top of 21. He's building this -- mega-network for Skywire. Let's use it.
MILO: We can't just assume they're standing by to receive Skywire 12 months from launch. I'd have to write in an aglet.
LISA: A what?
MILO: It's how on-line services push logos they wanna sell you. You don't ask for 'em, they just appear. 'Have to work on it somewhere besides my office or my house. And then the quality of the broadcast wouldn't exactly be digital, that's 12 months away.
LISA: But they'd still get the idea, right?
MILO: You'd have to design a graphic interface to make the data pop. Maybe some audio, too. To tie it all in to Gary. How long would that take you?
LISA: It's a standard GUI. Once I've got a concept, it's maybe three day's work.
MILO: Gary knows I'm close on Skywire. We have to do this fast.
LISA: Before they kill somebody else, too.
MILO: Oh, man. I'd have to get into Gary's house. To get the satellite positions.
LISA: You mean -- break in?
MILO: I don't know --
LISA: And what if the broadcast dishes on top of 21 aren't hot yet? You said the place isn't finished.
