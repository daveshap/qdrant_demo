HELP: SmartRecruiter Email not correct? Kind of urgent
Got contacted by someone at a company I applied too and they use smart recruiter. The email address she had sent the email on was not her company one it was smart recruiter. I replied to that one yesterday afternoon and she has not responded yet. I was looking at the email and I noticed the email I sent it to looks like a mess that has a smart recruiter address. I’m suspecting she didn’t get it and I want to resend my reply but there’s also a possibility that she hasn’t checked it yet. Has anyone had experience with smart recruiter? Tried googling it but it wasn’t helpful.
