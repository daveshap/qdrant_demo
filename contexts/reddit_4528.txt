Why do strangers care if another stranger wants to kill themselves?
I've been wondering about this too for the longest time. Why does it matter if me, a stranger on the internet, wants to kill myself? I mean it doesn't affect anyone else's life. My existence has no impact on anyone, so why does it matter if I were to just end everything? I'm asking more in general though, why do we care for other people and their well-being? What drives us to want others to not die.

Sorry if these are dumb questions or are super triggering.
