Reminder: Remember to check out your employer's website or know what they do before your interview
We just interviewed a software dev and the guy doesn't even know what my employer do. My manager can't accept that and I agree. It say a lot about you if you didn't even bother to do your basic homework before interview.

How can anyone miss this? It's basic interview 101.
