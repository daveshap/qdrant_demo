DR. LECTER: They were slaughtering the spring lambs?
CLARICE: Yes...! They were screaming.
DR. LECTER: So you ran away...
CLARICE: No. First I tried to free them... I opened the gate of their pen - but they wouldn't run. They just stood there, confused. They wouldn't run...
DR. LECTER: But you could. You did.
CLARICE: I took one lamb. And I ran away, as fast as I could...
DR. LECTER: Where were you going?
CLARICE: I don't know. I had no food or water. It was very cold. I thought - if I can even save just one... but he got so heavy. So heavy...
CLARICE: I didn't get more than a few miles before the sheriff's car found me. The rancher was so angry he sent me to live at the Lutheran orphanage in Bozeman. I never saw the ranch again...
DR. LECTER: But what became of your lamb? Clarice...?
DR. LECTER: You still wake up sometimes, don't you? Wake up in the dark, with the lambs screaming?
CLARICE: Yes...
DR. LECTER: Do you think if you saved Catherine, you could make them stop...? Do you think, if Catherine lives, you won't wake up in the dark, ever again, to the screaming of the lambs? Do you...?
CLARICE: Yes! I don't know...! I don't know.
DR. LECTER: Thank you, Clarice.
CLARICE: Tell me his name, Dr. Lecter.
DR. LECTER: Dr. Chilton... I believe you know each other?
