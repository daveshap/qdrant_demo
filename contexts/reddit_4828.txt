Can anyone who has dealt with sexual assault relate to this
I hate people telling me that I’m strong and that I’m brave. Fuck I cry almost every other day and I struggle with my self worth constantly. I’m afraid to take my pit bull outside to pee at night and to walk from the parking lot to my apartment which is a 50ft distance alone. I just don’t get why I’m being praised for something bad happening to me and it’s frustrating, I just don’t know how to respond to that. When my friends say things like “if I ever see him again, I’d (insert violence)” it doesn’t make me feel good. And then I start to think that they’re only saying that because it makes them feel good to be angry on my behalf. Idk it’s been pretty fucked lately.
