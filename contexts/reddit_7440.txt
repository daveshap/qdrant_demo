Should I continue with my SV?
I'm almost done with my MSc (yay!), but I realised something; I actually didn't really like working with my supervisor (SV) much : (

Apparently:

1. **Everything is last minute**; the grad school has set a guideline on the structure of the dissertation (e.g. to pass, the student needs to have X chapters completed e.g. from Introduction to Conclusion). After I submitted my dissertation to the SV for review, the SV said *"i need  chapter Y to be split into 3 chapters instead of just a single chapter ".* It was a total nightmare at the time because for the entire semester, the SV never said anything about splitting chapters! I had 1 week to redo everything - I'm also a part time student working full-time : /
2. **Late feedback**: it took 6 months for one of my papers to get any feedback - literally, out of the blue, totally ... out of nowhere, I got an email from the SV asking me to rewrite parts of the paper that was sent 6 months ago - and asking me to send it for publications.
3. **Superficial feedback:** I feel whatever she's highlighting or wanting to correct was based on just "glancing" through or "skimming" through the document - not really reading them properly.
4. **Students complaining:** one of my peers is also having the same problems with the SV. The other students did not have any of these problems with their SV.

I was thinking to do a PhD on my MSc topic, and the SV is working on the field - but:

1. I get stressed out each time I do the work thinking what else this SV will just chaotically ask us to do.
2. Messy supervision makes me anxious!

&#x200B;

Am I being stressed out because of this messy supervision, or I'm just stressed out of the MSc, or is this the norm with any SVs?
