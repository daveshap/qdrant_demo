How to back up and restore personal data safely from possibly exploited android phone? I'm using a Samsung J7 Prime with Android version 7.0, not rooted.Recently, I grew suspicious I had become the target of some kind of exploit/network attack/mitm. Since I suspect the exploit is probably running on the OS/firmware level, I'm going to try and do a clean install of the OS. However, I'm not sure as to how I can safely back up my personal data first. I don't want to back up any app data or settings whatsoever, just some documents and pictures and a messenger chat backup, using Google drive and an external USB drive. But every time I plug the USB in via OTG cable, all these unnecessary system files like com.kms.free, com.sec.android.gallery3d, com.google and such automatically get loaded onto the USB. I'm guessing these files are coming from my external sd card, as I read in another thread here that the OS creates some back up files on external media in case it fails to boot from the system partition. But assuming some malicious exploit is running on firmware level, these files could potentially infect both the USB and sd card, and thus by restoring any files from them, I will probably risk reinfection.Is there any way to stop this autobackup of system files and  safely backup and restore only my personal data from the USB and Google Drive? I learnt that if the exploit is in firmware or OS level, formatting doesn't help either, so I'll probably have to ditch the external SD card altogether. But I want my USB drive to avoid this infection, so that the personal data on it can be restored safely on the clean device. Same goes for the documents I have on Google drive, how can I be sure that the data uploaded to it is clean and therefore safe to restore?Please help me out a little, I'm really in a bind here. Need some guidance urgently, phone has become very unstable.
