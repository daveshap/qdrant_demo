JUDGE: You've got to do something!
VENKMAN: Who are they?
JUDGE: They're the Scoleri Brothers. I tried them for murder. They were electrocuted up at Ossining in '48. Now they want to kill me.
VENKMAN: Maybe they just want to appeal.
VENKMAN: These boys aren't playing around.
JUDGE: You've got to stop them. Please!
