I fucked up, am I about to lose my job offer?
I'm such a fucking idiot. 


Got an offer. Decent salary, in the middle of the posted range, and first job for me out of uni. Was putting off reading through the legalese of the offer but had seen the salary and was considering whether or not to negotiate it (position was supposed to start Monday). Manager calls to see if I had any questions, and I just confirm I'm excited, haven't read through the offer fully but will be coming in Monday.


After verbally accepting I start second-guessing myself and reading online about how I should try to negotiate. So I send an email saying I'd read the offer and wanted to talk about base salary yada yada counter-offer. Except after thinking about it in the past few hours I realized that I verbally accepted and was basically just trying to selfishly get a couple thousand more out of them - and really it's my own damn fault for not looking over the offer and responding before the last minute. 


Anyways then I panicked and sent them an email apologizing for making the counter-offer after accepting, that I'd been building up nerve to negotiate and had a momentary lapse of judgement and was sorry for putting them in an awkward position at the last minute + hoped everything would be okay moving forward. No response yet. How fucked am I? Am I overreacting? Are they going to rescind my offer? How bad of an impression am I making? (everyone else I met with in the company seemed to really like me up until now...)
