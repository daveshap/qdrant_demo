Tips to avoid bitterness?
To keep the background short, I've been job hunting for well over a year, and nightmare interview stories aside, 0 success.

The problem Ive recently encountered is, i've become so, so, bitter about the whole thing. Every time I see "entry level" I can basically already guess it's gonna want 5-7 years experience plus a phd. Every time I get a message on indeed that they insist i need to respond to, I can already guess it's an automated "we moved on" or some other form of automated message because no human being bothered to even look at my application and hired the boss' friend's kid.

Soon, I'll be starting an MBA and while I do have valuable business, internship and career experience, i'm currently a waiter after bailing on an EXTREMELY toxic workplace, and getting back to a business position has just been absolutely crushing. ( seriously, i once had an interviewer suggest i start as a busboy in the office building's cafeteria?) ultimately. it just makes me bitter as hell and completely un-motivated. why should I care about these companies when the recruiter doesn't even remember my name? why should I be so content to treat these interviewers like gods, when they'll throw my application in the trash if I so much as blink at the wrong time?

All in all, im really just feeling totally burned out and bitter, does anyone have any advice on dealing with this?
