Will disclosing disabilities affect me in corporate?
TW: sexual assault/mental health

I have dealt with an anxiety disorder for many years now, along with mild PTSD from my sexual assault, and I would like to know if disclosing this will affect me in my corporate life. 

I was given an optional form where I can disclose these kinds of disabilities, and although it states that disclosing this information will not subject me to differential treatment, I would just like to know if this is just for HR's records or if it will realistically negatively affect my position at the company. I am already very closed-off on speaking about my mental health issues and past trauma with close friends, so I feel even more reluctant about speaking about it in a professional setting.

If anyone has had this kind of situation, please let me know if you disclosed and if anything happened! 

Thank you!
