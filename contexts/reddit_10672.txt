Threw all of my bullets in the river this morning.
I'm not gonna lose. This isn't gonna beat me. Last time I felt like this, I threw my firing pin into my back yard. Once I felt better, I found it, cleaned it, and put it back. 

But at this point, I don't think I can ever have a gun again. got rid of the bullets first, since without them, it's useless. I think I'm just gonna drop it off at the police station and tell them I don't want it anymore.  


It's just so hard to fight. I don't want to be alive. I want to die. 

Things have happened to me in the past two weeks that could break even the strongest person. 

I found out my ex, who I still cared about deeply, was beaten to death. She died cold and lonely, with nothing. In the street in front a a fucking Salvation Army soup kitchen. She stole clothes to stay warm. And some asshole decided she needed to die for that. 

I found out that I have cancer. Even best case scenario, I am in for a ton of pain and misery. And that's if I even make it. I really hope I don't. 

And then, to top it all off: 

I got the girl of my dreams pregnant. 

The baby is gone. 

And she won't talk to me, at all. 

I'm not even sure what happened. Did she abort it? Did she miscarry? Was she trying to keep it? I can't get over the fact that I may never know the answers to these, and so many more questions. 

Like, we knew she might be pregnant. And she seemed to not hate me. But then, all in one message, she tells me that she was pregnant for sure, and now she isn't, and she doesn't want to talk to me anymore. 

How can you just give someone news like that and then disappear? 

I kinda wish I still had those bullets. And that's why I needed to throw them out. 

Even if no one ever sees this, it felt good to get it out. I have a therapy appointment in 8 days, and I'm just trying to hold out until then.
