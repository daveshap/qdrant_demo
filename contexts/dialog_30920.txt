CHUCK: How ya doing?
ROBIN: Fine.
CHUCK: Good.
ROBIN: Look, I appreciate, you know, the concern and all, but like he said, I can take care of myself.
CHUCK: I just brought you something to eat.
CHUCK: I feel like I got you into this.
ROBIN: Forget it.
CHUCK: I'm used to spending a lot of time alone. I guess that's what I thought it would be out here. But, it's not is it?
ROBIN: I'm sorry I left you hanging up there.
CHUCK: It doesn't matter. Really. I'm just sorry you got chewed out.
