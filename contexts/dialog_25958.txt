JACKIE: Small world.
RACHEL: Luke's depo ran late. I promised I'd take notes.
RACHEL: So I have to tell you something in confidence...
JACKIE: You're a cross-dresser.
RACHEL: That. And. Annabelle is over her head. With Brad 'The Dreamboat' Kovitsky.
JACKIE: She hasn't mentioned this.
RACHEL: She was afraid you'd make a big deal out of it.
JACKIE: Moi?
RACHEL: Toi. They've been 'going out' for two weeks.
RACHEL: As you may know, 'going out' in the six grade doesn't mean shit. They don't actually <u>go</u> to a movie or anywhere, they don't even eat lunch together, it's just a declaration to the world that they're...
JACKIE: ...going out, yeh. I had kids of my own, once.
RACHEL: Anyway. He walks up to her on lunch yard today. And tells her... publicly...that they're 'breaking up.'
JACKIE: Oh, my God.
RACHEL: Right. Which is the whole <u>point</u> of this 'going out' thing, so one of them can dump the other one, and they can imitate the whole passionate adult soap opera tragedy, without ever having to actually date.
JACKIE: She's devastated.
RACHEL: Doesn't <u>begin</u> to describe it. I mean, you've got cancer, <u>this</u> is serious.
