SMITH: Skipper...
MILLER: What is it, Smith?
SMITH: I just saw Weir, I think he was messing around on the Clark.
MILLER: Smith, get out of there...
SMITH: Come again, Skipper?
MILLER: One of the explosives is missing from the corridor. I think Weir may have put it on the Clark.
MILLER: Get off the Clark now and wait for me at the airlock.
SMITH: No, no, we just got her back together...
MILLER: Get out of there now!
SMITH: Where is it, where is it...
MILLER: Smith? Smith! Fuck!
