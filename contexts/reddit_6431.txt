What’s everyone’s opinion about AlphaSights?
I’m about to graduate with a bachelor’s degree in business and they reached out to me through handshake. I looked at some reviews but they are pretty conflicting, either really good or pretty bad. The pay looks good but I’m afraid that it wouldn’t be the best move for my career since it just looks like a call center basically and that’s not what I want to do.

Please share your experiences with them if you have any.
