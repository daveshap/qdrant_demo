It's actually getting better!
I don't know if this is relevant to this subreddit, I'm just so excited I have to share this with someone.  


I've been on a intense journey to recovery for the past month without really seeing progress. And when I say intense, I mean every second has been dedicated to getting better. But all of the steps I've took didn't actually make things better, but rather just prevented me from harming or killing myself. Basically I've stayed in the sattle while still being terrorised. And it never felt worth it, until now!

Tonight I got 7 or 8 uninterrupted hours of sleep! And for the first time I genuinely believe there's hope for me.

  
Sticking to recovery has been the hardest most un-gratifying thing I've done in my life. But I'm sticking to it! I'll still take all the small steps, and whatever it takes. And whenever I'll start to question it, I'll have this to look back at, and know it works, it just takes time and patience.  


Lots of love to the other fighters out there!
