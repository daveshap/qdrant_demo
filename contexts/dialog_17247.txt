TRAPPER: Okay, I'm closing up. Everybody relax.
ME LAY: May I have the surgeon's name, please?
HAWKEYE: He's the pro from Dover and I'm the Ghost of Smokey Joe.
ME LAY: Save that crap for the rest of the clamdiggers back home.
HAWKEYE: Did I ever tell you about Me Lay Marston?
TRAPPER: Your high school friend who went around saying 'Me lay, you lay?' to all the young females in the community. As I remember, you said it was quite a successful approach.
HAWKEYE: Well, he wouldn't score more than once in seven or eight tries, but the important thing was he didn't waste time socializing. Anyway, Trapper John, this is Me Lay.
ME LAY: The real Trapper John? The one who threw you the famous pass and went to greater glory on the Boston and Maine Railroad?
HAWKEYE: The one and only.
ME LAY: Proud to know you, Trapper. Like to shake your hand if you'll hurry up and get that chest closed. You still working the trains?
TRAPPER: Planes mostly. May take a crack at rickshaws. How does the direct approach work over here?
ME LAY: I been out of action since I got over here five months ago.
HAWKEYE: You don't go after the local scrunch?
ME LAY: I'm too busy, actually. Not for the Army, of course, but where I live. Dr. Yamachi's New Era Pediatric Hospital and Whorehouse. I'm serious. The guy has this crude hospital for kids and a whorehouse on the side to finance it, all in the same building.
HAWKEYE: What do you do in the joint besides pimp?
ME LAY: That's about the only thing I don't do â€“ that I'm built for. I inspect the girls and take care of some of the kids in the hospital. Sometimes I tend bar and act as bouncer.
