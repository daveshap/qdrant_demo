All I want is a high school movie that’s realistic
There aren’t any “mean girls” anymore. No one writes letters to their crush. The popular kids are generally nice people, that’s why they’re well known. No one is going to make fun of you for reading books. People don’t dress like that. Hardly anyone eats school lunch. No one is getting shoved into lockers. 

Is it really that hard for the script writes to ask teenagers what goes on in school?
