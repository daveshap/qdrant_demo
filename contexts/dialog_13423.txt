MRS. RAND: I really intended going out to the Fort and meeting you long before this, Miss Connell. I'm Mrs. Rand -- Wesley's mother.
BETSY: Oh, Mrs. Rand --
MRS. RAND: Come, come, don't tell me how sorry you are that I should meet you this way. I'm even a little glad that Wesley's difficulty brought us together.
BETSY: Believe me, Mrs. Rand, he doesn't do this often. This is the first time I've seen him --
MRS. RAND: Nonsense, child! I know Wesley's been drinking too much lately. I know a great deal more about what goes on at Fort Holland than you'd think. I know all about you -- that you're a nice girl, competent and kind to Jessica. The Fort needs a girl like you. But now we've got to get you back there. I'll walk you back and stay over night. It'll be a nice change for me.
BETSY: Thank you, Mrs. Rand. I think you're every bit as nice as Wes says you are.
MRS. RAND: So -- he says I'm nice. He's a nice boy, too, Miss Connell, a very nice boy. But I'm worried about his drinking.
BETSY: I'd love to.
MRS. RAND: Use your influence with Paul. Ask him to take that whiskey decanter off the dinner table.
BETSY: I've no influence with Mr. Holland.
MRS. RAND: Try it -- you may have more influence than you think.
