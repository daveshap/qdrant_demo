Do jump stunts benefit you? In Mario Kart 8 (I'm playing Deluxe on the Switch but I guess it's the same either way), when you go over a jump, you can also press the jump button, and if you time it right, you get a speed boost.You can also push the left stick in a direction at the same time to make the jump more stunty: your character might stand up in the seat, or roll.Is this change when you use the stick purely to animation, or does it have any effect on the gameplay (such as increasing the amount of boost)? If it has an effect, does it make a difference which direction you push, and if so, what's the best way to do it?
