ROBIN: My parents don't do it anymore.
CHUCK: How do you know? They might.
ROBIN: 'Cause they're getting a divorce. That's why they sent me here. My sister's at Tabor. They just wanted us out of the house so they could get down to business.
JOHN: They tell you that?
ROBIN: I figured it out.
CHUCK: Yeah.
JOHN: My old man split along time ago. It doesn't mean anything. You just take care of number one that's all that matters.
ROBIN: It matters to me.
JOHN: Okay donut. Whatever you say.
