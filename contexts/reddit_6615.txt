Is it normal to have a lot of down time in an office job?
I work at a large company (300,000 employees) and about half of my day is spent sitting around despite asking for more work. This is my first job post college so it's a new experience all together. 


I spend probably close to half of my day just sitting around. I'm nervous about it because I feel like I'm being unproductive. I ask for more work most every day and my workload hasn't increased. I've been here for a few months now so I'm starting to think it's normal, but I'm still unsure of the situation. 


Is it normal to have this much downtime in an office job? If so, what do you do to fill the time and be more productive?
