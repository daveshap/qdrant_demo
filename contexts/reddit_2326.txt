I'm So Thankful to my Parents
Sixteen years ago, my parents won their green cards and decided they were going to move to the US. On March 22 2003, they arrived in California and restarted their lives from nothing.

For years, my dad held two jobs while my grandma raised us and my mom spent everyday at the library studying for her medical exams. My parents never gave up on their dream for a better life here.

Sixteen years later, my mom is finishing her second fellowship as a pathologist at one of the world's best hospitals. 

Sixteen years later, on the exact day we came to America, I got into UCI, USCD, UCLA, and USC (LOL don't know how I'm paying for any of it)

I still think about what my life would have been like if my parents hadn't given up everything for my siblings and I.  I'm SOOOOOO thankful they took the chance they did. Today just reminded me.

P.S.

IK this is uber cheesy and gross but it's true and I feel so grateful. if ur parents did the same, thank them
