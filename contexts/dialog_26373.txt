LANA: And three years after the Royal Wedding, the King abdicated. Isn't that terrible?
CLARK: It sure is.
LANA: There must be a gallon of potato salad left over.
LANA: You know what's the problem?
CLARK: Too much mayonnaise?
LANA: Mayonnaise? Donald loved mayonnaise. Why would you think that was the problem.?
CLARK: I didn't --
LANA: No, the problem is -- Why do I stay in Smallville? Believe me, I've asked myself the same question. Do you know how lucky you are to live in Metropolis? The Big Apricot.
CLARK: But Lana, you could --
LANA: That's easy to say. But how? And what about Ricky?
CLARK: Who?
LANA: Ricky. My little boy. At least here we've got a house. and I've got a job. Okay, I'm only a secretary, oaky, but it pays the bills. Except for last winter when the fuel bills kept going up and up and up. I even had to pawn my diamond ring then.
