SHERIFF: It's kinda frightening to think that a kid like that can go so far over the edge. Jason really screwed up the poor sonofabitch's mind.
DEPUTY: He really believes Jason's still alive, doesn't he?
SHERIFF: But that's no what worries me the most...It's how far he'll go to try and prove it.
KATIE: Come on, you guys! The game's over!!
STAN: You don't know for sure. What about Roy? Nobody's seen him.
KATIE: Of course not. If he hasn't already accidentally pelleted himself, I'm sure he's lost.
STAN: Yeah, but the game's not over until it's over.
