ROHNA: The gentleman is dissatisfied with room number five fifty-nine.
KRINGELEIN: I certainly have a complaint -- and a fair one.
KRINGELEIN: I came here from a long distance to stay at the Grand Hotel. I want a room -- a big room -- like you would give General Director Preysing -- I'm as good as Mr. Preysing -- I can pay like Mr. Preysing -- would you give him a little room, way up in the corner with the hot water pipes going -- bang -- bang -- bang...
DOCTOR: This gentleman can have my room.
KRINGELEIN: Oh!
DOCTOR: Send his bags up to my room.
KRINGELEIN: Oh -- but -- I --
DOCTOR: You're tired. I can see that.
KRINGELEIN: Yes -- yes -- I am tired. I have been ill...
DOCTOR: You are ill.
MANAGER: Mr. Kringelein will take room number one-seventy-six, one of our most expensive rooms. It is large and on the front with bath.
KRINGELEIN: Does that mean that the bath is my own? --- Private?
MANAGER: Certainly, sir.
KRINGELEIN: Well, now, that's very kind -- thanks. That's what I want -- a large room on the front with a private bath -- Yes, that's what I want. I can pay now if you like.
