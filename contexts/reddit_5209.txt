Company blew off my references and finally got back to me 2 months later.
Over the summer I applied to a pretty large organization -- In 3 weeks time, I interviewed twice, produced a work sample and submitted, upon their request, my references. The department person I was in contact with called all my references and left voicemails. All my references called this person back, in one case twice, and left him voicemails, yet none of them ever heard from him after that. 

Two months later I get a letter in the mail saying I wasn't selected.  I'm a little bummed but mostly miffed because of how my references were blown off.

The HR contact who coordinated my interviews was very nice in my interactions with her. I want to email her, thank her for the opportunity and ask what I could have done to improve my application....but how do I mention my curiosity about the reference situation? I can't help but think the department dude dropped the ball and tanked my candidacy.   


Thanks all!
