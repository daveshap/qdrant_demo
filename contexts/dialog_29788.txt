CUSTOMER: Yeah, I subscribe. It's a pretty decent one.
CLARENCE: Have you read the story on Elvis?
CUSTOMER: No. Not yet.
CLARENCE: You know, I saw it on the stands, my first inclination was to buy it. But, I look at the price and say forget it, it's just gonna be the same old shit. I ended up breaking down and buying it a few days later. Man, I was ever wrong.
CUSTOMER: That good, huh?
CLARENCE: It tried to pin down what the attraction is after all these years. It covers the whole spectrum of fans, the people who love his music, the people who grew up with him, the artists he inspired - Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, and the fanatics, like these guys. I don't know about you, but they give me the creeps.
CUSTOMER: I can see what you mean.
CLARENCE: Like, look at her. She looks like she fell off an ugly tree and hit every branch on the way down. Elvis wouldn't fuck her with Pat Boone's dick.
