MILES: So what's the plan?
JACK: The plan is... you go.
MILES: Me?
JACK: My ankle. Just go explain the situation.
MILES: Uh, excuse me, sir, but my friend was the one balling your wife a couple hours ago, and he seems to have left his wallet behind, and we were wondering...
JACK: Yeah, yeah. Like that. Just like that.
JACK: Fuck you. I'll get it myself.
MILES: Hold on.
MAN: You don't think I fuck you, bitch? I'll fuck you.
CAMMI: I'm a bad girl. I'm a bad girl.
MAN: You picked him up and you fucked him, didn't you, bitch?
CAMMI: I picked him up and I fucked him. I'm a bad girl.
MAN: And you liked fucking him, didn't you, you fat little whore?
CAMMI: I liked it when you caught me fucking him.
MAN: The fuck was that?
CAMMI: The wallet! He took Derek's wallet!
