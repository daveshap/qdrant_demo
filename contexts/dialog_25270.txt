KIRK: So how did a nice girl like you get to be a cetacean biologist?
GILLIAN: Just lucky, I guess.
KIRK: You're upset about losing the whales.
GILLIAN: ... You're very perceptive.
KIRK: How will that be done, exactly?
GILLIAN: They'll be flown in a special 747 to Alaska and released there.
KIRK: Flown... And that's the last you'll see of them?
GILLIAN: See, yes. But we'll tag them with radio transmitters on a special frequency so we can keep tabs on them.
KIRK: You know, I could take those whales somewhere they wouldn't be hunted.
GILLIAN: You? You can't even get from Sausalito to San Francisco without a lift.
GILLIAN: Thanks. Cheers.
KIRK: If you have such a low opinion of my abilities, how come we're having dinner?
GILLIAN: I told you: I'm a sucker for hard luck cases. Besides, I want to know why you travel around with that ditzy guy who knows that Gracie is pregnant and calls you Admiral.
GILLIAN: Where could you take them?
KIRK: Hm?
GILLIAN: My whales? Where could you take them where they'd be safe?
KIRK: It's not so much a matter of a place as of time.
GILLIAN: Sorry, the time would have to be right now.
KIRK: What do you mean now?
GILLIAN: Let's just say that no humpback born in captivity has ever survived. Problem is, they won't be a whole lot safer at sea because of all the hunting this time of year... So that, as they say, is that. Damn.
GILLIAN: What's that?
KIRK: What's what?
GILLIAN: You got a pocket pager? What are you, a doctor?
KIRK: What is it? I thought I told you never to call me --
SCOTTY: Sorry, Admiral. We just thought you'll like to know, we're beaming them now.
KIRK: Oh I see -- Tell Them phasers on stun. Good luck. Kirk out.
GILLIAN: Wanna try it from the top?
KIRK: Tell me when the whales are going to be released?
GILLIAN: ... Who are you?
KIRK: Who do you think I am?
GILLIAN: Don't tell me: you're from outer space.
KIRK: No, I'm from Iowa. I just work in outer space.
GILLIAN: Well, I was close. I knew outer space was going to come into it sooner or later.
KIRK: All right. The truth?
GILLIAN: I'm all ears.
KIRK: That's what you think. Okay...Truth... I'm from what, on your calendar, would be the late 23rd Century. I've been sent back in time to bring two Humpback Whales with me in an attempt to... repopulate the species.
GILLIAN: Well, why didn't you say so? Why all the coy disguises?
KIRK: You want the details?
GILLIAN: Are you kidding? I wouldn't miss this for all the tea in China.
KIRK: Then tell me when the whales are leaving.
GILLIAN: Jesus, you are persistent. Okay, your friend was right. Gracie is not only pregnant, she is very pregnant... At noon tomorrow -- in what is sure to be a media circus -- the whales get shipped out.
KIRK: Noon tomorrow...?!
