NIKI: Look, I really don't know your daughter but...
JAKE: But what?
NIKI: I wouldn't expect too much. I mean about her coming back. Once a girl gets into the life.
JAKE: What makes you so sure?
NIKI: You wife isn't dead is she?
JAKE: Why do you say that?
NIKI: Just a guess. She ain't dead though is she?
NIKI: She left you right?
JAKE: Yeah. She was the one called Joanne. How'd you find that out?
NIKI: Just a guess. Did you have it good with your wife? You know, sex.
JAKE: I don't blame you, Niki. Really I don't. It's this culture, where everything's based on sex, sold on sex... ...magazines, music, TV. It's destroying everything. Buy this 'cause of sex, use this 'cause of sex. Kids think it's normal. They think they're supposed to talk dirty, wear scanty clothes...
NIKI: Don't get upset. I lied too. I don't make no five hundred dollars a week. Everything I make goes to Granville.
JAKE: Granville?
NIKI: My man. 'Pimp.' I split 'cause he don't treat me for shit. Thinks he's so cool 'cause he's black. I once tried to take my clothes but he says, 'You can't take 'em 'cause they're my clothes -- I bought 'em.' Yeah, with my fucking money...
JAKE: Look, Niki, this really isn't my business. I don't know anything about...
NIKI: So I guess we're both fucked, huh? But at least you get to go to heaven. I don't get shit.
