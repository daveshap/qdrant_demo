I2C - Can I control the SCL line with a output only pin if I am not expecting clock stretching? I'm short on pins and am working with extremely low budget and small sized circuit board. So, if the I2C slave does not clock stretch, can I safely delegate the SCL pin to some output expander (Shift register or Binary Decoder)?The circuit contains the following:ATtiny13aDS130774hc138 (binary decoder) or 74hc595 (shift register)In short, is it absolutely necessary for the SCL line to be pulled up and kept in open drain condition? (Both in general and in context of DS1307 chip)
