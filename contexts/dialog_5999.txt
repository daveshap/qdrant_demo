HOMER: She knows how to take care of herself.
CANDY: This came for you a couple of days ago. Olive asked me to bring it. With everything happening, I guess she forgot.
HOMER: Sure. Thanks.
CANDY: I know you don't think much of being needed, or of me for that matter...
HOMER: I'm sorry for what I said about Wally needing you. It was... unnecessary.
CANDY: No, I'm the one who should be sorry. You have every right to be angry.
HOMER: No. You warned me. I didn't listen, but you warned me.
