CARL: He's got your prick in his back pocket, son, and you're standing naked in the display window of Macy's. He's using you. Only you're too blind to see it.
BUD: No, what I see is a jealous old machinist who can't stand that his son's become more successful than himself.
CARL: What you see, son, is a man who never measured success by the size of a man's wallet.
BUD: That's because you never had the guts to go out into the world and stake your claim.
CARL: Boy, if that's what you think, I must've really screwed up my job as a father.
CARL: ...as far as being axed, I'm still here and as long as I am, I have a responsibility not just to me but to the union members I represent...
BUD: Your responsibility, Dad, is to present the facts, not your opinions, to the men... you're gonna destroy their lives, Dad! Don't do it to 'em. Give it a chance. Let the membership decide for themselves, Dad. Please.
CARL: I'll be damned that when my men come to me tomorrow morning, wanting to know what's going on, I'm going to lie to them!
BUD: Your men! All my life your men" have been able to count on you? Why is it that you've never been there for me?"
