HARRY: Nice joint. Can you afford it?
FRANCES: Nope. The studio pays. Thank you, Harry.
HARRY: What for?
FRANCES: For not chopping off his head and serving it to me on a platter.
HARRY: Well, I would have, you know? I just didn't know how to cook it.
HARRY: Six months' probation...? You gotta learn when to do battle, Farmer. You're not going to win many bouts with 200 pound cops.
FRANCES: I took the early rounds.
HARRY: I'll bet.
FRANCES: I don't know. It hurts, Harry. Some things, no matter what you do with them, they just hurt.
HARRY: So you drink, and you fight with a cop...?
FRANCES: Yeah, and you look at people and you wonder who the hell they are, what's going on inside their heads. Sometimes you can hear it, like a buzzing, the things that happen in their heads. And you wonder: does anybody ever love anybody, really?
HARRY: Beats me.
