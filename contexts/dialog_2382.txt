REV. SULLIVAN: Jamie, you're not mad at me. You're mad at Landon --
JAMIE: I am mad at you! And at Landon! And the universe! And God! I don't even know where to put all my anger.
REV. SULLIVAN: That's normal. God accepts your anger. He won't punish you.
JAMIE: By making me ill, he is punishing me! I just don't know what for.
