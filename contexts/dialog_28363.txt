COMBS: Granger, this is Combs. Why haven't we heard from ya? Everybody else is in.
GRANGER: We had a few problems with the Law this morning. The Mayor promised the Jaycees to get tough on the rackets again, so he shut everybody down for a couple hours to make it look good. Nothing serious, it just put us a little behind for the day.
COMBS: You been making your payoffs, haven't ya?
GRANGER: Hell yes. He does this every year. There's nothing to worry about.
COMBS: Okay, finish your count and get it up here as soon as you can. I don't wanta be here all night.
GRANGER: Believe me, the Man's gonna be real happy. Looks like we cleared over ten grand this week.
COMBS: We cleared 22 here.
GRANGER: Well, hell, you got the whole Chicago south side. How do ya expect the eight lousy spots I've got to compete with that?
COMBS: They did 14 grand in Evanston, 16.5 is Gary, and 20 in Cicero. Looks like you're bringing up the rear, Granger.
GRANGER: I just got the count. We'll put the take on the 4:15.
COMBS: We'll be waitin'.
