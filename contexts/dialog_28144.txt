JANE: Piss off!
LOMBARD: Thanks for cleaning my flat and sending my money, all right?... Come on, I need you. It’s important.
LOMBARD: Just ask if they can recall recommending my services to anyone in the recent past. Say you’re my secretary, all right?
JANE: Your secretary, huh!
LOMBARD: I’d appreciate it if you could do this for me. If you can’t, don’t worry about it. I’ll call in about an hour anyway. Sorry but I’m in a hurry.
JANE: What are you up to, eh, Savieer? I mean, not this but... Money, passports, a gun in a microwave? Who are you, eh? Who are you?
