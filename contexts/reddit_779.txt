Why are my interactions like this?
Its this girl at my school who I thought liked me. She always try to get next to me. But when I ask her to hang out or stuff one on one she always seems to be busy.

 I'm curious because all the females I like do this to me. When I am by myself they love chilling with me but when I try to hang with them they are busy. It frustrates me a lot because it's a waste of time. But I am curious on why does it happen. 

Like I figured they just want to "be friends" but if that's the case why do they pretty much abandon me when I try to hang out?

This cycle has been happening since I was in middle school and now I'm going to collage. 

The theories I have on why it happens is because I could just be "eye candy" to them because I am a pretty handsome guy as my mom tells me. Lol. But it can't just be that right. Like, I don't think people would interact with me if I were just eye candy. 

Can someone help me figure this out because it's always in the back of my mind.
