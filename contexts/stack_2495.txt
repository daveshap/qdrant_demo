Table Join only returns first record from CSV table in QGIS 3.0.3 I have a .csv file that contains instances of hospitalization with diagnosis codes and zip codes and I want to join it to the corresponding polygons in the TIGER 2017 zcta510 shapefile. Every time I attempt to do this by selecting the Joins button in Layer Properties...then +...Join layer is my .csv import...join field is Zip...Target field is GEOID10.Anyway, it seems to be only importing the initial instance when each zip code should have multiple instances. I am trying to use the symbology tools to create a shaded view of where patients are coming from. I have a feeling that I'm missing something simple...but I've over-thought it now.
