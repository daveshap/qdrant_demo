Coping with layoff, getting back into the work force.
I got laid off from the job of my dreams. I did something silly and reapplied for it, relocated for it halfway across country for it out of pocket, took a nearly $4/hr pay cut to keep it. I had my reasons, but essentially, my mental illness caught up with me, I was hospitalized, and I quit for medical reasons. Fortunately I was approved for unemployment. 

I fancied being anti work for a few weeks, and living an alternative lifestyle, but I thought better of it. I digress. 

I worked in IT, within a help desk role. Many people call it hell desk, but I loved it. I learned to be fairly good at it and enjoyed doing the tasks, but what made it amazing was I loved the people I worked with, and I had an excellent manager. It was the first job I could tolerate working full time and over time. It was my first time not reliant on public assistance just to survive. 

I guess. . . I'm posting this looking for advice on how to move on and deal with the grief. Words of encouragement welcome. 

Thanks for listening.
