RUDY: Your pen palls dead, lady.
ASHLEY: If you say that, if you keep saying that, they will kill you. If they think you're not you, they will kill you. Don't you see? I know what you're doing, but it won't work!
RUDY: Nick died for me....
ASHLEY: I won't let him hurt you! He just wants what you know!
RUDY: ...maybe I die for Nick...
ASHLEY: Just tell him what you know, Nick! That's all they want! And we'll get out of this!
