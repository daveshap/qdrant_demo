CRAIG: Morning.
LOTTE: Gotta run. Shipment of grub worms coming in first thing.
CRAIG: Enjoy.
LOTTE: Craig, listen, honey, I've been thinking... maybe you'd feel better if you got, you know, a job or something.
CRAIG: We've been over this. Nobody's looking for a puppeteer in today's wintry economic climate.
LOTTE: Well, you know, maybe something else until this whole puppet thing turns around.
CRAIG: The Great Mantini doesn't need a day job.
LOTTE: Craig, everyone can't be Derek Mantini. Well, grub worms are waiting. Do me a favor?
CRAIG: What?
LOTTE: Would you check in on Elijah? He seems to be a little under the weather this morning.
CRAIG: Which one is Elijah again?
LOTTE: The monkey.
CRAIG: Yeah. Okay.
