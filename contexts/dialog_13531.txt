JASMINE: Wait. I have to tell you something.
STEVE: What?
JASMINE: Be careful.
STEVE: Look, after your shift tonight, why don't you grab Dylan and come stay with me on base.
JASMINE: Really? You don't mind?
STEVE: Naw. I'll just tell my other girlfriends they can't come over tonight.
JASMINE: You know, you're not as charming as you think you are.
STEVE: Yes, I am.
JASMINE: Dick-weed!
STEVE: Butt-munch.
