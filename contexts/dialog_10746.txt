JOSH: You must have known all along how I -- you know -- how I felt about you -- it must be totally obvious... God... I always used to dream about this...
ENID: Why do you have that stupid poster?
JOSH: Oh, hi...
ENID: Why do all guys have to play stupid guitars? It's so typical... Either they're into cars or guns or sports or guitars... it's so obvious...
JOSH: How long have you been up?
ENID: I couldn't sleep... I should get going; I feel really weird...
JOSH: Do you want to go get breakfast somewhere?
ENID: I don't think we should... Look, you have to totally promise me you won't tell Becky about this.
JOSH: Why not?
ENID: Because if you do, I'll kill you!
JOSH: Okay... I promise.
ENID: Just take my word for it... if she ever finds out about this I'll never hear the end of it...
