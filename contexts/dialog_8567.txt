LUKE: Ben? Ben?
YODA: Free your mind and return he will.
LUKE: My mind fills with so many images.
YODA: Control, control you must learn of what you see. Not easy, not fast.
LUKE: I see a city in the clouds.
YODA: Bespin. I see it too ... Friends you have there, heh? Concentrate and see them you will.
LUKE: I see them! ... They're in pain ... they're suffering.
YODA: It is the future you see.
LUKE: Will they die?
YODA: Difficult to see. Always in motion is the future ... Back away, little machine!
LUKE: They're my friends.
YODA: Foreknowledge is helpful, but painful sometimes and dangerous too. You have far to go in your training.
LEIA: What are you staring at?
HAN: Who's staring?
LEIA: You look silly.
HAN: You look great.
LEIA: Has Threepio turned up yet?
HAN: Huh? Oh. Your droid's been gone too long just to be lost. He may have gotten into some trouble. Chewie went to look for him. Come over here. I want to check this out.
LEIA: I hope Luke made it to the fleet all right.
HAN: Luke! I'm sure he's fine. Probably sitting around wondering what we're doing right now.
CHEWIE: Barks at his master.
LEIA: What happened?
HAN: He found him in a junk pile ...
LEIA: Something's wrong here. Your friend Lando is very charming, but I don't trust him.
HAN: Well, I do trust him. Lando's an old friend. Must have been an accident.
LEIA: Chewie, do you think you can repair him?
CHEWIE: Howls and shrugs his shoulders.
HAN: Why don't we just turn him over to Lando to fix?
LEIA: No thanks.
HAN: Look, sweetheart, I'm not going to have you accusing my friend of ...
LANDO: Sorry, am I interrupting anything?
LEIA: Not really.
LANDO: I must say, your beauty is unpar- alleled. Truly you belong here with us among the clouds.
LEIA: Thanks.
LANDO: Would you care to join me for a little refreshment?
CHEWIE: Barks at the mention of food. Licks his lips.
LANDO: Everyone's invited, of course.
