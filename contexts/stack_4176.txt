What would happen to Earth's climate and sky if the ozone layer was completely distroyed? It would be very interesting to have sci-fi stuff showing our planet lacking the ozone layer due to deterioration of biodiversity and pollution.I read that Earth could not have life if there wasn't an ozone layer to filter the uv radiation from the Sun. If the ozone layer was distroyed, what would happen to Earth's biodiversity and appearance? Would Earth no longer have forests and fauna even if rainfall continued to exist?And what would happen to Earth's sky? Would it still be blue or would it change its color and brightness? Would sunlight look brighter or dimmer?
