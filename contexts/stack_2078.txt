Indirect complement or postmodifier in NP In the sentence[1] He is the most talented artist (that) I knowwhat is (that) I know in terms of function \u2013 an indirect complement, licensed by most, or simply a common postmodifier? Why?Similarly, what is in the world in[2] the most talented artist in the worldand why?Addition to the original post:Having read the answer and the comments that I've received for this question, along with answers to other questions about licensing and the modifier/complement distinction, I have to give this another go: According to the comments below, we are dealing with modifiers rather than (indirect) complements in both the above examples. I'm not doubting the validity of these comments \u2013 I just still don't understand. This is why:   As far as I've been able to understand, licensing is all about setting up \"slots\" for specific kinds of structure. For instance, a verb such as give sets up a slot for something being given, and a slot for a recipient; consequently it licenses two object complements (direct and indirect object). Part of the deal is also that the slots set up are specific to a subset of \"licensers\"; in this case: not all verbs license two objects.Now, to me it seems that this 'setting up slots that are specific to a certain subgroup' is exactly what superlatives do, something that, I think, is supported by John Lawler's answer below:<blockquote>  Most is a superlative marker and takes a superlative construction. One of the things required for the construction is a range for comparison </blockquote>Looking again at [1] and [2], it seems to me that both the relative clause in [1] and the PP in [2] elaborate on the \"range-for-comparison-slot\" set up by most; hence, they should both be licensed by most, no?Now, if these dependents are indeed licensed, they should be complements \u2013 shouldn't they? Only, since they aren't licensed by the head noun, but rather by another constituent within the NP, they'd be indirect complements. This is my take on all this \u2013 could someone please explain to me where I go wrong, and how I should think instead?Thank you
