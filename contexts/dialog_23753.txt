BETTY: I bet that Macy Struthers had a hand in this. We'll probably be replaced by an hour of fashion tips!
OLIVER: Now Betty, don't overreact.
BETTY: Overreact! You're the one with theories about conspirac... Oliver?

BETTY: Are you spoken for this evening?
BERT: Right! An early start with Janet's debut on 'Good Morning Denton.' By the time we unveil Farley's 'Faith Factory' we will have earned our beauty sleep.

BERT: Home?
NATION: This is the nerve center of operations, Janet. You must stay here tonight. That way we can all be here when Mr. Sun paints us a new day with his golden brush.
MAC: And you can 'peep in' on Brad in the morning.
