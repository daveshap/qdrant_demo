DOCTOR FULTON: You might not have done it had you known.
KATHY: You're damn right! I'm a child psychologist and you send me into a room with someone who could be a murderer!
DOCTOR FULTON: Would you mind keeping your voice down? I have guests.
KATHY: Oh, well we wouldn't want to disturb your guests, would we?
DOCTOR FULTON: The police came to me for help. What could I do?
KATHY: You could have been honest with me for starters. We work together. I have to be able to trust you.
DOCTOR FULTON: I admit I handled it badly. Sanderson wasn't going to talk to me... but you're young, attractive--
KATHY: --the same type as the girl who got killed. Jesus, Alan, the guy could be a psychopath.
DOCTOR FULTON: They asked who would be best suited for this and you--
KATHY: Don't patronize me! You sent me into a potentially dangerous situation and didn't warn me!
DOCTOR FULTON: It worked out alright, didn't it?
KATHY: Fuck off!
