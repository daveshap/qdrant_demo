FREDDY: Very little decay. With this magnificent specimen for a body, all we need now is an equally magnificent brain. You know what to do!
IGOR: I have a pretty good idea.
FREDDY: Do you have the name I wrote down?
IGOR: Yes. Dr. H. Delbruck.
FREDDY: I want that brain.
IGOR: Was he any good?
FREDDY: Was he any good??? He was the finest natural philosopher, internal medicine diagnostician and chemical therapist of this century.
IGOR: Hmm!
FREDDY: And he wrote seventeen cookbooks.
IGOR: That's not bad.
FREDDY: Can you imagine that brain in this body?
IGOR: I'm getting excited just thinking about it. What if he's not there?
FREDDY: He only died two weeks ago -- I'm sure they'll still have him. Hurry now. I'll prepare the body.
IGOR: Oh! May I call you 'Master'?
FREDDY: Why?
IGOR: It's always been one of my favorite names.
FREDDY: If you like -- just hurry!
IGOR: Thank you, Master.
