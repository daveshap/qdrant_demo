Split a large PDF into thirds on a Mac I have been looking for a way to take a 412 page PDF on my Mac and split it roughly into thirds.  The googling that I have done suggests that you copy individual pages onto your desktop, and then combine them all using Preview, but doing this with 136 pages seems like a terrible idea.  The alternate method I have seen is to \"Print to PDF\" but print selected page ranges.  This seems like a doable method, but many of the pages in the front of the PDF do not have page numbers, also, the \"Save to PDF\" in the print dialog does not have the option to select a page range on Sierra!What am I missing?  How does one split a large PDF into chunks on a Mac?
