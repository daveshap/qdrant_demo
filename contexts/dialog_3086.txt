BRUCE: Do you remember the night I fell into that cave and the bat chased me?
ALFRED: Your parents' wake. Rain fell like tears.
BRUCE: ...The night Batman was born. What was I doing in the fields that night, Alfred? What sent me running out into that storm? I keep dreaming about it but I just can't remember.
ALFRED: I don't know, sir. Your dear parents. Suddenly gone. So much loss...
BRUCE: I remember the bat, though. His scream. Those eyes. i was sure the fear would kill me. In time I came to believe that if I became a monster, that if I was feared, I wouldn't be scared anymore. I was wrong. They think I became Batman to fight crime. I became Batman to fight the fear. And instead I became the fear.
