CONWAY: See that spot?
GEORGE: Yes.
CONWAY: That's where we were this morning. He had it marked. Right on the border of Tibet. Here's where civilization ends. We must be a thousand miles beyond it - just a blank on the map.
GEORGE: What's it mean?
CONWAY: It means we're in unexplored country - country nobody ever reached.
