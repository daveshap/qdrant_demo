Parents grounded me for a month for watching gay porn
This is a update for my other post 
Update: I put gay porn on the laptop while sitting next to them my step dad and mum yelled at me to close it. 

And they took my laptop and grounded me for a month.  I have no wifi privileges now. 

And if I want to study i have to do it in front of my mum.
