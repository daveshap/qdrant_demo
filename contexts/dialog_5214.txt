STRASSER: Mademoiselle, after this disturbance it is not safe for Laszlo to stay in Casablanca.
ILSA: This morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave Casablanca.
STRASSER: That is also true, except for one destination, to return to occupied France.
ILSA: Occupied France?
STRASSER: Uh huh. Under a safe conduct from me.
ILSA: What value is that? You may recall what German guarantees have been worth in the past.
STRASSER: There are only two other alternatives for him.
ILSA: What are they?
STRASSER: It is possible the French authorities will find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here.
ILSA: And the other alternative?
STRASSER: My dear Mademoiselle, perhaps you have already observed that in Casablanca, human life is cheap. Good night, Mademoiselle.
ILSA: What happened with Rick?
LASZLO: We'll discuss it later.
LASZLO: Our faithful friend is still there.
ILSA: Victor, please, don't go to the underground meeting tonight.
LASZLO: I must. Besides, it isn't often that a man has a chance to display heroics before his wife.
ILSA: Don't joke. After Major Strasser's warning tonight, I am frightened.
LASZLO: To tell you the truth, I am frightened too. Shall I remain here in our hotel room hiding, or shall I carry on the best I can?
ILSA: Whatever I'd say, you'd carry on. Victor, why don't you tell me about Rick? What did you find out?
LASZLO: Apparently he has the letters.
ILSA: Yes?
LASZLO: But no intention of selling them. One would think if sentiment wouldn't persuade him, money would.
ILSA: Did he give any reason?
LASZLO: He suggested I ask you.
ILSA: Ask me?
LASZLO: Yes. He said, Ask your wife." I don't know why he said that."
