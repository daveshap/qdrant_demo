JEANNE: Take mine instead -- here -- smash mine first!
LA HIRE: Jeanne... get up... this is ridiculous...
JEANNE: If you kill him, you kill me!
GILLES: Jeanne... let him do it. One more dead body's not going to make any difference, so who cares?
JEANNE: I care! And I care because God cares! All life is precious to God -- even his -- even yours and mine...
LA HIRE: Jeanne... the man hasn't been paid for six months -- that's his only reward. Let him take a few teeth...
JEANNE: A few teeth... that's the price of his life?
SOLDIER: Yeah...
JEANNE: Here -- take this instead.
