CONKLIN: What?
ZORN: Abbott wants to talk.
CONKLIN: Tell him we're busy.
ZORN: I tried.
ABBOTT: Storm clouds are gathering, Ted. It looks like rain and I don't have a thing to wear.
CONKLIN: I don't know what we're talking about.
ABBOTT: We're talking about Marseille. We're talking about Nykwana Wombosi. And I'm asking you if this abortion in Marseille has anything to do with Treadstone. Was this Treadstone?
CONKLIN: You're asking me a direct question?
ABBOTT: Yes.
CONKLIN: I thought you were never going to do that.
ABBOTT: They're putting together an agency oversight committee. They're going to look through everyone's budgets. Treadstone is a rather sizable line item in my ledger. What am I going to do about that?
CONKLIN: You'd want to make that go away. You'd want to remind them that Treadstone is a training organization. That it's all theoretical. You'd want to sign off on that.
ABBOTT: And what if I couldn't do that?
CONKLIN: Then I'd have to explain Treadstone. And you'd have to explain how you let me get this far. Doesn't sound like much of a Plan-B, does it? We'll clean up the field. You clean up your budgets.
