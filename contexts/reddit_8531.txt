What are the rules governing archive of Presidential conversations? Not official documents, but just phone calls and meetings?
So, two questions: 

1.) What are the practices/rules around retaining records of Presidential communications and conversations?

2.) What is the law about when such records must be turned over to Congress?


With the discussion of Trump providing an overview of his call with Ukraine and [Feinstein asking for an 'official word-for-word transcript of the call'](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/463376-feinstein-calls-for-word-for-word-transcript-of-trump-call-at-heart-of) can anyone explain where the cut off is for what gets retained?

I know [Obama used executive privilege to block the disclosure of some internal communications in that gun running thing,](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/28/eric-holder-contempt-historic-congress-vote) but will there be a different categorization for calls with foreign governments?  

And if so, are ALL calls transcribed like this, and archived?
