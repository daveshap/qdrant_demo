How do I fix a friendship
So me and my really close friend had a really bad argument and she told me to never talk to her again (basically I pissed her off really bad because it was her birthday soon, not party just birthday, we hadn't made any plans to do anything that day so i made other plans. She got really pissed and when i asked if she wants to do something the next weekend or the weekend after, my treat, she said no. She also had plans to do something on her birthday which fell through.) I was really messed up over this and was in a massive slump for a while. She attempted to call me the week after but the thought of picking up gave me a panic attack so i just let it ring. This happened a couple times after and same deal. I was closer to answering the next couple times but i almost threw up. She texted me seeing if i wanted to try to make it work but for some reason i denied the offer. I feel like shit for doing it and i want to try and sort things out but i suck at argument and sorting out problems and just looking at her contact makes my anxiety go nuts. I would really appreciate any advice of what you would do in this situation. Thx
