HOFFY: What's the big idea, Sefton? Take that telescope out of here.
SEFTON: Says who?
HOFFY: Says me.
SEFTON: You take it out. Only you're going to have a riot on your hands.
HOFFY: Every time the men get Red Cross packages you have to think up an angle to rob them.
PRICE: When the Krauts find that gadget they'll throw us all in the boob.
SEFTON: They know about that gadget. I'd worry more about the radio.
DUKE: I suppose they also know about your distillery and the horseraces?
SEFTON: That's right.
DUKE: Just what makes you and them Krauts so buddy-buddy?
SEFTON: Ask Security. You tell him, Price. You've got me shadowed every minute of the day. Or haven't you found out yet?
PRICE: Not yet.
HOFFY: Answer the question. How do you rate all those privileges?
SEFTON: I grease the Kraut guards. With ten percent of the take.
DUKE: And maybe a little something else?
SEFTON: A little something what?
