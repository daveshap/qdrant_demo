WITWER: He came to see you yesterday. Right before he got tagged. What did you talk about?
BURGESS: The Mets. John doesn't think they've got a deep enough pitching roster this year, and I'm inclined to agree.
WITWER: Why are you protecting him? You knew he was doping, yet you did nothing about it.
BURGESS: The man lost a child, for Christ's sake...
WITWER: Six years ago. What did you two talk about yesterday afternoon?
BURGESS: None of your damn business.
WITWER: Oh, it's all my damn business now, Lamar. Investigation of a supervising office for a capital crime falls under federal jurisdiction... so as to rule out any possibility of conspiracy. He's my suspect.
BURGESS: He's my subordinate!
WITWER: Shall we call the Attorney General? I'm sure he'd be happy to clarify the issue for you.
BURGESS: I don't want John Anderton hurt.
