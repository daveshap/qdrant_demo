RONALD: Wow. I never knew she had these kind of feelings.
SEBASTIAN: You're a lucky guy.
RONALD: She really loves me.
KATHRYN: What do you do? Tell her you love her.
RONALD: But I can't even see her. She doesn't have her own phone, I don't even know her e-mail address.
SEBASTIAN: Ronald, e-mail's for geeks and pedophiles. Be romantic. Write her another letter.
RONALD: How will I get to her?
