BECKY: It's a sign --
ANNIE: It's a sign I've watched this movie too many times. I'm so stupid. From the minute I listen to that stupid program on the radio, I've been a complete jerk.
BECKY: You don't know who she was, Annie --
ANNIE: I saw her. She looked just like this --
BECKY: This is a photo of hair.
ANNIE: Well, it's the same woman. And he was crazy about her. What is this? This is from Seattle.
ANNIE: Becky?
BECKY: So I mailed your letter.
ANNIE: Dear Annie: Thanks for your letter. It was great. We're very excited about meeting you in New York on Valentine's Day and seeing if we are M.F.E.O. Sleepless in Seattle.""
BECKY: M.F.E.O.?
ANNIE: Made for each other.
