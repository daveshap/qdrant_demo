How should I tell my crush I like him on Valentine’s Day ?
I (13f) am making him (14 m) cookies and I’m not sure if I should just tape them to his locker or give them to him in person, and if I should tape them to his locker, should I include a note saying I like you, etc. /what should it say?
A little background : I think he likes a friend of mine because that’s what I’ve heard but I’m not sure anymore. And that friend told me to just shoot my shot and I want to. Anyways.
