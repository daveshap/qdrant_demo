JEN: It's heavy for such a thin piece of metal!
YU: The handle is heavy. And the blade is no ordinary metal. Still, the sword is the lightest of weapons. You're just not used to handling it.
JEN: But I have had much practice. As a child in the West, a platoon lived with us. They'd let me play with their weapons. The scabbard is so beautiful.
YU: Beautiful but dangerous. Once you see it tainted with blood, its beauty is hard to admire. It's 400 years old.
JEN: Exquisite! You said it belongs to...
YU: My friend Li Mu Bai. He's given it to Sir Te as a gift.
JEN: Li Mu Bai! The famous warrior? Why would he give his sword to Sir Te?
YU: You're too young to understand.
JEN: You're a sword fighter too?
YU: Yes, I am. But I prefer the machete. Certain moves, however, call for a sword.
JEN: Really?
JEN: It must be exciting to be a fighter, to be totally free!
YU: Fighters have rules too: friendship, trust, integrity... Without rules, we wouldn't survive for long.
JEN: I've read all about people like you. Roaming wild, beating up anyone who gets in your way!
YU: Writers wouldn't sell many books if they told how it really is.
JEN: But you're just like the characters in the stories.
YU: Sure. No place to bathe for days, sleeping in flea-infested beds... They tell you all about that in those books?
JEN: You know what I mean. I'm getting married soon, but I haven't lived the life I want.
YU: So I heard. Congratulations. It's the most important step in a woman's life, isn't it?
JEN: You're not married, are you?
YU: What do you think?
JEN: No! You couldn't roam around freely if you were.
YU: You're probably right.
