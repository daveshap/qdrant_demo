SPENGLER: Who was that?
STANTZ: Some crank. Looking for goat hooves. Come up with anything?
SPENGLER: This one's interesting. Berlin, 1939, a flower cart took off by itself and rolled approximately half a kilometer over level ground. Three hundred eyewitnesses.
STANTZ: You might want to check those Duke University mean averaging studies on controlled psychokinesis.
SPENGLER: Good idea.
VENKMAN: Oh, hello, perhaps you could help me. I'm looking for an aerosol love potion I could spray on a certain Penthouse Pet that would make her unconditionally submit to an unusual personal request.
STANTZ: Oh, hiya, Pete.
VENKMAN: So, no goat hooves, huh?
STANTZ: I knew that voice sounded familiar. What's up? How's it going?
VENKMAN: Nowhere -- fast. Why don't you lock up and buy me a sub?
STANTZ: Uh, I can't. I'm kind of working on something.
VENKMAN: Egon!
SPENGLER: Hello, Venkman.
VENKMAN: How've you been? How's teaching? I bet those science chicks really dig that big cranium of yours, huh?
SPENGLER: I think they're more interested in my epididymis.
VENKMAN: I don't even want to know where that is.
