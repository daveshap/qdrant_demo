In $E=hf$, can $f$ assume any positive value? (Beginner) The energy of photon is given by the equation $E=hf$, where $h=$ Planck's constant, and f=frequency of radiation. Is f quantized, or can it assume any value? If it can assume any value, then wouldn't this mean that the energy of photons is not quantized? If f can be any value from a continuous series, this would mean that for any number you imagine, there will always be another number that when multiplied by h gives you that first number. So $E$ could assume any value. However, we know that $E$ is indeed quantized, so could someone please point out the flaw in my reasoning?
