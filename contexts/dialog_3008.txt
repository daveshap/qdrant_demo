BATMAN: Admiring your handiwork?
PENGUIN: Touring the riot scene. Gravely assessing the devastation. Upstanding mayor stuff.
BATMAN: You're not the Mayor.
PENGUIN: Things change. Hey, good to meet you. We'll be working hand in glove in Gotham's glorious future.
BATMAN: Once you were their freak, now these clowns do your bidding. Must feel pretty good.
PENGUIN: Better than you know, Bat-boy.
BATMAN: What're you really after?
PENGUIN: Ah, the direct approach. I admire that in a man with a mask. But you don't really think you'll ever win, playing it your way ..?
BATMAN: Things change.
