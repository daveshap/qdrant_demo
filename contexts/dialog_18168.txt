LUCIANO: Meyer.
LANSKY: It's nothin'. I'm gettin' married.
LUCIANO: Married? To Anna? You ain't got her in trouble?
LANSKY: No. We ain't even...
LUCIANO: Well, good. Woman like that you don't have to keep an eye on.
LANSKY: Guess I'm not a single type guy.
LUCIANO: Whatta ya mean? It's great!
LANSKY: We're going to Atlantic City for the honeymoon.
LUCIANO: I'll talk to Nucky. Get you set up like the fuckin' Prince of Wales.
LANSKY: I been thinkin'...
LUCIANO: Good. 'Cause every time you start thinkin', we end up makin' money.
LANSKY: We need to put together a meet for the whole country. We all got the same problems. We could talk. Meet the guys we don't know. Lift a few with the guys we do.
LUCIANO: Like a party for all our friends.
LANSKY: Italians, Jews, Irish. One big party. Course, some guys don't get along.
LUCIANO: Like Don Maranzano.
LANSKY: And if we don't invite Maranzano, we can't invite Masseria. Guys don't wanna be choosin' sides.
LUCIANO: I'll handle the Boss.
LANSKY: So we end up with everybody but the two Bosses, at our meet. We ain't sayin' we're the leaders, but we're leadin'.
LUCIANO: How soon can we pull this off?
LANSKY: I'm gettin' married in six weeks. I'll already be in Atlantic City which is probably the best place to do it anyway.
LUCIANO: Your honeymoon, Meyer?
LANSKY: Might as well put the time to use.
