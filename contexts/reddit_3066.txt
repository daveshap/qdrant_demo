I’m not sure whether this is the right place to post, but I’m looking for some career advice. (21M), I’m in a hellish construction job and want to become an independent scuba diver. Can anyone help?
I’m 21, living in England, I have been out of education for 3 years now with no A-levels (long depressing story) I’m very money driven although it’s not the be all and end all. My passion is scuba diving and I love the ocean environment. I also would like to make a series documentaries around diving, similar to BBC’s blue planet but more Centers around diving.

What I’m doing now and what I don’t like about it: I’m currently working for my dad in construction, I’m a labourer on £8.50 per hour, terrible money for the graft imo, it’s very tedious and I hate manual labour. I really hate the people I work with too, except for a minute few, they’re vulgar and extremely close-minded people. It’s a stressful and frustrating environment.

Now I’m not going to sugarcoat the fact that I was a spoiled kid, which I’m not blaming anyone for, my parents had a poor upbringing and didn’t want they’re children to experience the same lifestyle. So, it’s bittersweet, it definitely hasn’t helped me acclimatise to the “real world”.

I’m blabbing now but essentially I just want to earn a nice income, be independent and work with my passion. 

I’ve looked into marine biology and commercial diving, none quite fit the picture. Can anyone give me some advice on how to move forward?
It’s been 3 years and I’m in the same place as I was when I was in school. Thanks Reddit.

Tl;dr - I want a job in scuba diving, that pays well and I’m self employed (ideally). I can’t stand construction anymore.

Requested edit: I also have advanced and rescue scuba qualifications along with multiple specialities including dry suit, videography and nitrox gas. Definitely willing to do more training.
