How to apply?
I’m 30, I have earned an AA from a local community college. Do I need to request my high school transcript to apply to my university of choice? I don’t think I ever took an SAT test. Do I need those things for admission now?

Edit: I am blown away by the helpfulness if everyone here. I have been feeling pretty ashamed that it took me until 30 to want to go to college, compounded by the fact that I have NO idea how to get started with the process. You all have been so great and encouraging. This is a true r/humansbeingbros moment and I’m so grateful. You all boosted my self esteem and really helped me figure out the right direction for admissions.
