How to install Ubuntu 18.04 along with Windows 10 in Legacy BIOS Mode? I am using Windows 10, recently I want to move Ubuntu 18.04, and for some reason I can't completely uninstall Windows 10 now, So I want to use Ubuntu 18.04 along with Windows 10. But the problem is: When I run the Ubuntu Installation, it does not show Install Ubuntu alongside Windows. Which is expected by me, as previously I've used Ubuntu [ From 15.10 to 17.10 ] with Windows 7. So I don't try Something Else option to install Ubuntu, because I am in fear if I won't access Windows 10 from GRUB.Anyway, currently Windows 10 is installed in Legacy BIOS mode &amp; I think Ubuntu want UEFI.So, can anyone tell me, is it possible to install Ubuntu in Legacy Mode? If yes than how?
