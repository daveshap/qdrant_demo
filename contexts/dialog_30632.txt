GEKKO: Got him at an auction in Kentucky.
BUD: How much?
GEKKO: Close to two million. But this sucker can go all the way to Devon and the nationals.
BUD: Devon? He looks like Seattle Slew. What about the Triple Crown?
DARIEN: He's not a racehorse, Bud, he's a jumper.
BUD: How would I know? I once bet a horse. He went out at ten to one and came in at quarter to five.
