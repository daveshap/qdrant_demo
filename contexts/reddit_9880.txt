Another intern said that she's paying someone to write her thesis.
I'm at my ACUHO-i internship for a summer practicum. One of the other interns here told me, along with a few other interns, that she is paying someone to write her thesis for her. I don't have any solid proof, and we think she's lying, but it really rubbed us the wrong way. Do you recommend that we email the department head at her institution to let them know?

I asked some of my colleagues who are higher up in the SA world, and a few said that they don't want me to burn bridges, especially if it comes back that we reported it. But knowing this girl, she won't last very long in the SA world and our paths might never cross. They are worried that I'll be blacklisted from whatever institution she worked at, but as stated before, she's not meant for this field and is burning bridges here at this institution she is currently working at.
