LPT: When looking for a new job and you know a friend works at a large company you are interested in, don't just ask them to help you get a job or send them your resume. Instead, look at the company's opportunities listed on the company site and ask if they can help you with the XYZ posting you saw
I work for a large financial company. We are large. And people always ask "can you help me get a job at MyCompany?" As an entry-level, non-manager employee I have a little influence over who is hiring and very limited knowledge of all the groups and their job postings out there. I'm one of 25,000 employees in 1 department out of literally 100s. But I can still help you in the job you're interested in.

We have a wonderful referral program (as do many companies). If you go on to the job site, see a position you qualify for, and are reliable then there's no problem referring you to a different application link for that specific position. Every job has a code and all we need is that code. Can't promise an interview but they do put a different consideration on the application when being referred. That's how I can help. A lot of large companies work this way.
