!4.04 still having an amd radeon r9 380. are their drivers still compatible with the latest ubuntu version? I am a new linux users that got his pc about a year ago. I still have my good and old AMD Radeon R9 380. The thing is that i couldn't upgrade my Ubuntu to a newer version (lets say... 16.04) because that version didn't have the drivers required for the card to work properly. I want to know if the newer versions of Ubuntu have any form of compatibility with my graphics card. And if yes, how do i upgrade?
