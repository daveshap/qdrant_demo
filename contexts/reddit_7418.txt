How do Theses actually work?
Right now I am currently a rising senior, but I would love to go into PT in the future, and I have a ton of questions, this being just one of them.

I understand you have an advisor while your doing your thesis. What exactly does he/she do, and are they your PERSONAL advisor, as in they are only advising you and no other students, or do they help multiple students at once?

Also, how do you pick your topic? Surely there cannot be original research every single time. There is only so much research that can be done with the tools we have, and someone, somewhere has probably done it, right?
