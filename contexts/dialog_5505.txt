THEO: Didn't we play this scene before?
LENORE'S VOICE: Don't leave me here to die -- Theo, please -- you can't let me die --
THEO: I'm afraid I've used up all my good deeds for the day.
LENORE: I picked the wrong number when I chose you ... didn't I?
THEO: Turns out you did me a favor. You're looking at a rich man.
LENORE: -- The phones, Theo. Don't leave any of them behind. The cops could pull up a record of all our calls and -- find you.
