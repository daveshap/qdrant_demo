What items can be created using Chem Fluid and Strong Chem Fluid? There is a trophy/achievement that requires you too create all items that can be made using either Chem Fluid or Strong Chem Fluid:<blockquote>  1st Place at the Science Fair    Create all items that contain Chem Fluid and Strong Chem Fluid</blockquote>What is the full list of items that can be created to unlock this?In addition, I would be interested to know if any of them don't appear it the 'Combine Menu' which so far has been hinting on what items can be made by combining items in my inventory.
