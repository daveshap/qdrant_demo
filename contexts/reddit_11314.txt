I want to cut loose with a friend
We started hanging about 8 years ago in school and have remained in the same friend group since then. Little does he he know that for the past several years that I have wanted to cut loose. He's extremely passive aggressive towards us and mostly talks about himself and his childish problems. Anytime we would (non-aggressively) defend ourselves he would tell us to chill and basically tell us that we are too sensitive. 

He's also extremely hypocritical; everything he complains about other people, he does exactly. The story we hear is always the same about how everyone around him is wrong and that he's perfect. I know he comes from a pretty strict background and although I know he doesn't have bad intentions, I can barely stand his presence anymore. I wish him all the best in the future and I don't hate him, but I just can't be friends with someone like him.

I managed to talk to one mutual who feels the same way, but I am afraid to bring it up with the rest because the last thing I want to do is create any further tension. I know for a fact that if I personally bring it up with my problematic friend that he will get defensive, turn everything on me, and somehow say that I'm in the wrong (although he constantly has falling outs with other people and says that he hates when people are not direct). I need some advice on how I should proceed
