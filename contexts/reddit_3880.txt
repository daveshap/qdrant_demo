A girl gave me her number and I don't know what to text her
So I (M21) met this girl who works at the school library and we would always have some small talk about how we are doing and how classes are going, you know the normal college stuff. Then she suddenly asked me if I have an Instagram, to which I replied no but I asked if we could just exchange numbers. She then gives me her number and I am surprised and now I don't know what to send as the first text. What do you guys think???
