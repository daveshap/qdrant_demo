ERIK: What's it all about?
GRANDFATHER: What?
ERIK: We toil and labor, we loot and pillage, rape and kill... and yet...
GRANDFATHER: You talking piffle, son?
ERIK: Where does it all get us, Grandpa?
GRANDFATHER: Who have you been talking to?
ERIK: I met this girl...
GRANDFATHER: It's always the women that start the trouble.
ERIK: She got me thinking...
GRANDFATHER: So? What'd you do to her?
ERIK: I... I... KILLED her...
GRANDFATHER: That's my boy!
