MRS. STANWYK: What is this....
FLETCH: I checked. There was no divorce.
MRS. STANWYK: Are you telling me my husband is a bigamist???
FLETCH: I'm telling you he's not your husband at all.
FLETCH: And they're leaving the country tomorrow night.
MRS. STANWYK: Bastard.
FLETCH: I don't have all the pieces yet, but I'm close. I'll know tomorrow.
MRS. STANWYK: I'm calling the police. Right now.
FLETCH: You can't do that.
MRS. STANWYK: Don't tell me I can't --
FLETCH: They're trying to kill me!
