FLORENCE: Mit me, kid. I've got a classic.
EDITOR: You here again like an evil spirit to mar my happiness?
FLORENCE: This one's a story, but I'm not going to tell you what it is. Every time I tell you anything it goes haywire.
EDITOR: What do you mean -- haywire? You start out after murderers and come back with three-for-a-dime bootleggers. You start to solve murder mysteries and break up crap games. You're grand! I'm for you! Stupendous!
FLORENCE: Say, you're always razzing everything I do, but this is one time I'm in.
EDITOR: Go on, little girl, take your troubles somewhere else. I don't feel like talking to you.
FLORENCE: Was there any art on Judge Ramsey?
EDITOR: What goofy idea have you got now? Don't tell me you suspect Judge Ramsey of stealing the body.
FLORENCE: I'm going to make you eat dirt, you soap bubble! I'm going to make you beg for somebody to help you let go!
