MARCUS: Please, a little decorum if you will. What I was going to say is, is that holding that baby in my arms, I felt like I was twenty-one again. A call like that makes me think of going back to three nights a week, not two, start running again, cut down on the drinking.
FRANK: I'll drink to that.
MARCUS: Here's to the greatest job in the world.
FRANK: Greatest job in the world.
