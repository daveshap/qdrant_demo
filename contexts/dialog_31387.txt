JAMES LEER: That's a big trunk. It fits a tuba, a suitcase, a dead dog, and a garment bag almost perfectly.
GRADY: That's just what they used to say in the ads. Come on, Crabtree, I know you're holding...
JAMES LEER: Whose tuba is that anyway?
GRADY: Miss Sloviak's.
JAMES LEER: Can I ask you something about her?
GRADY: She is. Ah. Here we go...
JAMES LEER: Oh. So. Is -- is your friend Crabtree -- is he -- gay?
GRADY: Most of the time he is, James. Some of the time he isn't. Now what do we have here?
GRADY: Looks like... our old friend Mr. Codeine. That should take the pinch out of my ankle. Have one.
JAMES LEER: No thanks. I'm fine without them.
GRADY: Right. That's why you were standing in the Chancellor's back yard twirling that little cap gun of yours tonight. You're fine, all right, you're fit as a fucking fiddle.
