CLAY: This old guy -- he's the kind of person I expected to meet when I moved out here. Someone who's done things with his life.
BETTY: Do you realize you're more interested in this old goober than you ever were in me?
CLAY: It's different. He's a man. And by the way you have no business calling him a homo.
BETTY: It never crossed your mind?
CLAY: He's an artist. Anyway, he's too old to think about sex.
BETTY: All the old men I know think about nothing but sex.
