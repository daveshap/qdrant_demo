JOHNNY: Sir, I wish to reconsider my request to drop out, sir.
C.O.: Sorry, son. I can't do it. You signed the 1240/A. It would be illegal.
JOHNNY: Sir, i know it was wrong. I didn't learn from one mistake and I made another, sir. Sir, my family... my whole family was in Buenos Aires, sir.
ZIM: Is that your signature, Rico ?
JOHNNY: Sir, yes it is, sir.
ZIM: Doesn't look like it to me.
