SAM: Just coming up to ring for you.
NORMAN: I suppose you want a cabin.
SAM: We'd hoped to make it straight to San Francisco, but we don't like the look of that sky. Looks like a bad day coming... doesn't it.
NORMAN: I'll take you to...
SAM: Better sign in first, hasn't we?
NORMAN: It isn't necessary.
SAM: Uh, uh! My boss is paying for this trip... ninety percent business... and he wants practically notarized receipts. I better sign in and get a receipt.
NORMAN: I'll get your bags.
SAM: Haven't any.
NORMAN: I'll show you the cabin.
