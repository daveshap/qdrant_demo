KAWAKITA: Is Dr. Frock safe!
MARGO: Yes, he's fine. Greg... take care of yourself!
MARGO: Is there another way around?
PENDERGAST: No. The planetarium is in the next cell. This is one of the fire doors...
PENDERGAST: Vince? There's no way we can get to you with the fire doors down. There's an entrance to the sub- basement in the hall off the north side exit.
D'AGOSTA: The sub-basement?
PENDERGAST: I've been down there. It links up to the old sewer system. I can guide you out.
D'AGOSTA: How much ammo do we have to make a stand?
KAWAKITA: You're asking me? I don't even know how to load this thing.
