Reddit was the best and worst thing I have discovered
It all started with studying for the SAT, I created a reddit account to join r/sat to get extra resources and help. 

But then I discovered other communities of reddit...until I dawned upon r/suicidewatch. I spend hours on this sub. I’m so entranced by the resilience of others and what they have overcame thus far. But more selfishly I’m addicted to being heard. I’m addicted to voicing my sadness, my anger, my guilt etc. I love how ppl response and I love how ppl care. I crave this feeling real life but I know this fantasy will never be realized. 

However, this has proved catastrophic for me. I spend so much time on this sub and neglect all my other responsibilities.
