How do I access Itunes U Course Manager if my country isn\u2019t supported? I want to create a course but where I come from Itunes U Course Manager isn\u2019t supported. I tried solving this but with no success. I use Chrome and have downloaded an extension called Bitternet which sets up a Proxy so that my IP appears to be in the US. I have also created a new apple ID which has an adress in the US but still when i try to log into the Itunes U Course Manager it says \u201cCountry not supported\u201d.Is there a way to bypass this?
