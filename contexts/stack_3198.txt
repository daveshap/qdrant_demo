In \"Pacific Rim: Uprising\what is this object in the Jaeger simulator? About halfway through Pacific Rim: Uprising, Jake Pentecost comes to see Amara Namani in a Jaeger simulator where she's training, and they attempt to drift together. Before that, we see that the simulator contains <blockquote class=\"spoiler\">   what appears to be a human brain, suspended in a small cylindrical tank, which Jake calls by name and expresses some familiarity with.</blockquote>Presumably this is used to run Jaeger-piloting simulations with only one pilot, but is there any explanation for what this is and how it got there? I can think of a number of possibilities...<blockquote class=\"spoiler\">   - the brain of a deceased Jaeger pilot<br> - a cloned brain that was \"born\" in an artificial system and lives in VR<br> - a structural replication of a human brain that is not necessarily \"alive\"<br> - some sort of kaiju-brain derivative, which seems unlikely given the state of Dr. Geiszler</blockquote>However, there's certainly no explanation offered in Pacific Rim: Uprising. I don't recall this technology being referred to in the first film, but was there actually an explanation there, or in the Pacific Rim comic books, or in any other supplementary materials?
