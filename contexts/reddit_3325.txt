Bat Shit Plan: Go fully remote for US job and live in Central America to dramatically lower cost of living?
Edit: after a a little constructive feedback I see this post is better in the expat digital nomad community as the cometary would be more well informed. Much of the feedback thus far can be used in a constructive way, much of it is... lacking. The main issue remains logging into work systems with an asset that would be located in a far way country. 

I could just say my mother sick and I need to move to rural America to take care of her. I’ll tell the US government her place is my address. Heck I’ll even throw some money her way every month for the favor(her health is fine). 

Then I’ll work remotely from panama. It’s in the same time zone so I can do virtual meetings as if I was in the USA assuming my WiFi is good. At first I can only stay 6 months but later I can get a better permit. 

I’m thinking there may be issues with my work laptop location, that’s the only hitch I can think of here. That might be solvable. 

Am I stupid or genius???

This could free up way more money for saving/investing yeah?
