JACOB: None of us can remember that night. I get flashes of it but they don't make sense. We saw shrinks for years. But nothing they did could ever touch it. What happened? Was there ever an offensive?
MICHAEL: A couple of days later. It was fierce. You guys never saw it.
JACOB: But there was an attack. I can still see them coming. There was a fight, wasn't there?
MICHAEL: Yeah. But not with the Cong.
JACOB: Who then?
