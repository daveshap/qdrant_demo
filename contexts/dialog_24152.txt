MAC: What are you going to do? Shoot me?
JEREMIAH: Depends. You got some nerve intruding on a man's grief. I bet I could pull this trigger right now and call it justifiable homicide. Now: who are you?
MAC: You know who I am. You invited me.
MAC: I'm your son. And Laureen's son.
JEREMIAH: Ain't nobody mentioned that name on this farm for 14 years. My boy was taken from me... far as I'm concerned, he's dead. Now, I ain't gonna ask you again. -- Who are you?!
MAC: Joseph Macdonald... Your son.
JEREMIAH: Joseph Macdonald. Damn right, boy. And don't you forget it.
