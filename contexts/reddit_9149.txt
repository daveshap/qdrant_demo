Rant: I paid off my car and student loans and my credit score tanked
US Specific Rant: I completely wiped out my student loans and car note this month. I worked so fucking hard to make it happen, it took so much time and dedication, and how do the credit bureaus recognize this hard work? Tanking my score over 30 points!

In a system that thrives on people being chained to debt their whole life, I'm not sure why I'm so shocked and disgusted. But I'm both. Fuck the American debt system.
