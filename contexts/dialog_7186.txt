SARAH: Toby's right. They're not gonna sit around with their fingers up their asses while we bust up their toys.
JOHN: Datura.
SARAH: What?
JOHN: Datura Metel. The Devil's Trumpet. Don't worry. I ain't goin' religioso again. It's a flower that grows on these islands. Where I come from the voodoo priests used it whenever they needed a Mickey Finn. It's toxic. Ground up you can put it in a drink or inject it...or...in a sealed area it might be introduced through the ventilation system.
SARAH: Datura! Miguel knew it! Datura, he was shouting! Datura Metel!
JOHN: We always planned to use it. We got some ground up already...but we could never find enough.
SARAH: There's hundreds of 'em. Right where we landed our boat.
TOBY: This stuff really works? No shit?
JOHN: Quicker than gas. And it smells a lot prettier. It usually don't kill but it puts ya under fer a good night's sleep.
TOBY: If you could knock out the central communications room you could foul up their whole intercom system. Then, if you move fast enough, stay ahead of 'em...without bein' able to signal each other, they might have a hard time catchin' you.
JOHN: I say it's poetic. Pure calypso, brother. The Devil's Trumpet blowin' the notes o' doom for the Devil's troops. Ha ha ha ha ha...
SARAH: Looks like just two. We can take 'em when the time comes.
JOHN: We're only about a quarter-mile from Cave entrance number five.
TOBY: That entrance is closest to the labs and the Bee cages.
JOHN: Come on. Let's go.
