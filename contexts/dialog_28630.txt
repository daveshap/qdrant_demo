THE PRESIDENT: We give them something. We tell them we'll remove the missiles from Turkey say, six months from now so that there appears to be no linkage. We also tell them if they go public about it, we deny it and the deal is off.
KENNY: And we do it under the table so we can disavow any knowledge of it.
MCCONE: It's transparent. The press'll be all over it.
KENNY: Six months from now, I'm not going to care. Are you? We'll deal with it.
MCNAMARA: At least it will expose whether Khruschev has been overthrown. We'll know what we're dealing with.
KENNY: And if this is a move to appease the hard line, then it may just be the bone he needs to regain control of his own house.
