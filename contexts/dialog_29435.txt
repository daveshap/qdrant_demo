BARBARA: You might want to pencil in a little face-time with your daughter.
ROBERT: Barbara --
BARBARA: Because I'm at the edge of my capabilities, Robert.
ROBERT: The first thing we have to do is present a unified front.
BARBARA: If you start in on the war metaphors I'm going to drive this car into a fucking telephone pole.
ROBERT: Look, I'm as worried as you are --
BARBARA: No, I don't think so. Leave me alone, give me money. That's what I get from our daughter. She has a way of shutting me out that seems very familiar.
ROBERT: Yeah, well, she has a way of self- medicating that probably seems familiar, too.
BARBARA: I'm not the one who has to have three scotches just to walk in the door and say hello.
ROBERT: I have a drink before dinner to take the edge off my day. That's different.
BARBARA: Oh, it is?
ROBERT: Yeah, because the alternative is to be bored to death.
