GRACE: John!
JOHN: Grace!
GRACE: Are you all right?
JOHN: I think I busted my leg.
GRACE: Can you climb back up.
JOHN: I can't make it. Grace? Grace!?
GRACE: I'm here.
JOHN: Grace, listen to me. In the trunk of my car is a rope. It should reach down here. Got get it, throw it down and I'll climb up.
GRACE: I'll get it.
GRACE: John! Can you hear me? Are you still there?
JOHN: Where the hell am I going to go?
GRACE: John, you have to throw the keys up to me.
GRACE: John, throw me the keys.
JOHN: What for?
GRACE: The trunk. It's locked.
JOHN: It's not locked. I left it open when I took out Jake's body.
GRACE: It's . . . it's locked.
JOHN: You closed it, didn't you, Grace?
GRACE: I was going to back the car to the ridge and pull you up.
JOHN: Bullshit, Grace. You were going to drive off and leave me here.
GRACE: No. I swear it.
JOHN: And you're not one to lie, are you?
GRACE: Throw me the keys and I'll pull you up.
JOHN: Why don't you come down and get them so I can wring your pretty little neck?
GRACE: John, if you don't throw me the keys, then I'll just walk away. Walk away and leave you here.
JOHN: Walk to where? We're fifty miles to the nearest town. It's going to be over one-hundred degrees today. How far do you think you're going to get?
GRACE: Someone will find me.
JOHN: Yeah, they'll find you. Dried up and twice dead.
GRACE: You idiot! You'll kill us both!
JOHN: At least I'll have company when I die. Ain't that right, Jake?
GRACE: For Christ's sake, John! Throw me the keys!
JOHN: What do you say, Jake? Should we trust her? No? I didn't think so.
GRACE: Fuck you! Do you hear me, John!? Fuck you! John . . . John!?
