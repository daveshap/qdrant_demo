I’m having a really hard time
I’m really struggling maintaining my will to live. I’m tired of everything. And don’t want do go through everything to come. 

I recently went through some therapy through my college. My assigned therapist was a practicum student and last week was our last session together after this entire semester. I feel very empty now.

My mom lost her brother to suicide and my best friend lost another one of her good friends the same way. Seeing first hand the way it affected them keeps me going but that feeling is diminishing. 

I’m just so tired of everything and I have no motivation or energy to do the simplest of tasks. When I think of my future it seems like such a long road ahead of me and I don’t want to do it. I’m really struggling. 

I can sometimes see a future for myself and my career but at the same time that dream seems so fantasized and that I’ll never make it
