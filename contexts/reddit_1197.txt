Depression and anxiety together is the worst.
Depression makes me want to stay in bed and sleep all the time, and I'm always super tired when I'm not purposely overloading my body with sugar and caffeine.
  
  
At the same time, though, anxiety makes me stay up way longer because I'm constantly thinking, cringing, and panicking internally about some event in my personal life or some work scenario that I could have handled better.
   
  
These two issues mix together like oil and water. Like bleach and ammonia. 
  
  
I feel like I can never win.
