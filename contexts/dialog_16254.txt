NICK: Sawn-offs are out, Tom; people like to have a bit mare range nowadays.
TOM: Range? I don't want to blow the arse out of this country, granted, but I don't want anybody blowing a raspberry at me either. I want to look fucking mean.
NICK: Of course you will look mean, Tom, you will look really scary.
TOM: All right, let's forget about them for the time being. What about your weed man?
NICK: Rory Breaker is standing by. You stand to make a lot of money, Tommy boy.
