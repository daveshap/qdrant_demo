GILLES: And... what does Jeanne think?
JEANNE: I don't think. I leave that to God. I'm nothing in all this, I'm just the messenger.
DUNOIS: So... what is the message?
JEANNE: We offer the English a last chance to return home in peace. If they refuse, we recross the river and attack them here -- at the Tourelles.
DUNOIS: Jeanne, that really makes no sense at all. The Tourelles is virtually impregnable... besides, if we're on the other side of the river attacking the Tourelles, what's to stop Talbot attacking the city from the north?
JEANNE: God.
GILLES: God... why of course -- we'd forgotten about him! Strange, I don't seem to remember seeing him at Agincourt.
LA HIRE: Damn right!
GILLES: Oh, but I forgot! It was a Sunday... that explains it. God's day off.
JEANNE: You know, I feel a great sorrow for you, because you're laughing now, but by tomorrow night some of you will be dead and having to repeat your jokes in front of God.
DUNOIS: Jeanne, with respect -- we can't just attack the Tourelles like that -- it's a very complicated matter and...
JEANNE: What complicated about it? All you have to do is do what you're told -- what could be simpler than that? I'm the drum on which God is beating out his message -- beating so loudly it's bursting my ears -- but you're all so full of your own voices, you're deaf to His!
