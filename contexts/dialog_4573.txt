VIOLET: Caesar is going to get the money and bring --
CORKY: How much money?
VIOLET: Shelly said it was over two million dollars.
VIOLET: Caesar will bring it to the apartment to count and go through |Shelly's books to figure out how he did it.
CORKY: Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Do you have any idea what you are saying? You are asking me to help you fuck the mob.
CORKY: These people are serious, Violet. If you want to know how serious, ask Shelly. They're worse than any cop because they have lots of money and no rules. You fuck them, you've got to do it right.
VIOLET: That's why I need your help. You said you were good.
CORKY: I am, but ...
CORKY: All right, let's say for the moment that I believe everything you are saying.
VIOLET: You think I'm lying?
CORKY: I didn't say that, but since you did, let's say that you are. It would have been easy to set Shelly up. You could have got him killed knowing that Caesar would bring the money to the apartment.
CORKY: All you would need to keep yourself clean would be someone unconnected, someone like me.
VIOLET: Is that what you think?
CORKY: I'm just making a point. You have no idea what you're asking. How much trust two people need to do something like this.
