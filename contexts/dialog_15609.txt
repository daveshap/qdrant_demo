HANSEN: A marriage certificate? Who the hell carries their marriage certificate around?
TANDY: Maurice and Ellen Parker... it was issued in Philly... Mr. Maurice Parker has come a long way from home. Why?
TANDY: Hansen's whipped. Has to call his wife every two hours or she'll go ballistic when he gets home.
HANSEN: P-A-R-K-E-R. Right. Get on the horn with Philly. Call me here.
