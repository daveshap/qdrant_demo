CORKY: Gino Marzzone is coming to your apartment. It's a big deal, isn't it? That means Caesar will be ready. He doesn't want to look like an idiot. Gino has been there before?
VIOLET: Yeah, twice.
CORKY: What happened?
VIOLET: Not much, really. Caesar was nervous, kept cleaning the apartment. |The first time, he picked out the dress he wanted me to wear.
CORKY: Does Johnnie hit on you?
VIOLET: Johnnie hits on anything in high heels.
CORKY: Has Caesar ever seen him?
VIOLET: He does it right in front of him.
CORKY: It's getting better and better. Keep going.
VIOLET: Gino doesn't know English, or at least he pretends he doesn't, so he doesn't talk much. He gets right to the point. Both times they talked for about five minutes, had one drink and then they left.
CORKY: What did Gino drink?
VIOLET: Scotch, Glenlivet. I remember that Caesar made a huge deal about it.
