MIERZWIAK: Stan? What's going on?
STAN'S VOICE: The guy we're doing? He's disappeared from the map. I can't find him anywhere.
MIERZWIAK: Okay, what happened right before he disappeared?
STAN'S VOICE: I was away from the monitor for a second. I had it on automatic. I had to go pee.
MIERZWIAK: Well, where was Patrick?
STAN'S VOICE: He went home sick.
MIERZWIAK: Jesus. All right, what's the address.
STAN'S VOICE: 1062 Sherman Drive. Apartment 1E, Rockville Center.
MARY: He's coming?
STAN: You better go.
MARY: Hell no.
