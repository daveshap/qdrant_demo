The way people treat of me
I'm so sick of people calling me an asshole. I have a tendency to meet people, befriend them and jump right into joking around with them and no one seems to get that I'm not really trying to be mean. I just want people to like me and trust me to know when to be serious.
 
Also people will occasionally act superior to me like they know better than me, but truth is I do in fact know better than you how to do my job you stupid motherfucker.

And now one of my best friends is keeping me out of the loop of some obviously important stuff going on in his life. It seems like he's trying to keep me from getting involved to save me, but still it bothers me that he's going to this stupid girl he hasn't known as long who he isn't dating, who is less emotionally secure and intelligent than I about it. I think the official reason is she's privy to it all anyway, but dammit I don't know if he would have told me anyway.

Eventually all the nice and compassion in my heart is gonna dry up and I'm really going to be an asshole with a charred blackened heart.

Also, with nearly all my friends going to see a therapist, I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say I'm the most emotionally well adjusted of the bunch of us. I don't see why people don't just man up and deal with it and move on.
