look at all these dudes
I'm a bartender.  I remember one night, there were these two ladies at my bar, one of them was married and taking her newly single friend out for cocktails/commiseration what have you.  I overhead this, at one point:  the two of them were looking at some dating app and the single lady just said, kind of in an exasperated way, "look at all these dudes."  That always stuck with me for whatever reason, just a wall of dudes vying for attention.

Now that I'm single I can't shake that feeling every time I open up one of those apps.  I'm just another rando in a wall of dudes.  Smiling for the camera, holding a football or a basketball, posing while rock climbing or near a fucking canoe.  Just a wall of dudes, hoping and completely clueless that someone picks you up and somehow that answer is found.  If one falls out, another is there a second later to fill right in that place.
