I just had a small conversation with two girls in my class AND I DIDNT OVERTHINK IT they were so nice and we laughed a little. And I even went to the board today to participate in my maths class and I volunteered for it!!! And I dont feel nervous I just feel excited and happy and accomplished yay.
It's so weird feeling this way because I was thinking of committing suicide two days ago
