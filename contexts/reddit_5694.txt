Where can an older college student find a job that looks decent on a resume?
So I am currently 23 and studying mechanical engineering.I was recently let go from a grocery clerk position and so at the present time I am unemployed. It would be easy to get a job in retail at the local shops around where I live or in the food industry but I would prefer something that looks somewhat impressive on a resume. What resource could I use or where could i look to find such a job. Thanks!
