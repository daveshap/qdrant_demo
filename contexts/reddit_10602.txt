I'm gonna probably attempt to kill myself sometime during college
For so many years I've been putting it off, because people have been telling me "no dont die" and hobbies keeping me from doing it but looking on how I've reacted to and treated people, my sensitivity towards everything, I'm going to kill myself. 

Even if I were to continue living what's the point? I'm so replaceable, I lack self confidence to the point where I feel awful about letting people down when I mention that I'm sad.

I'm going to do this. Plan and all. Giving the people in my lives a final goodbye before I do it. At least they have a better look on to why I did it. 

Not gonna lie, kinda scared, but hey we all are gonna die anyways so what makes my death any different? I can literally write anything here about how I'm going to end it and no one I know will find it. Not that they would like what I've written. 

I dont care that I have potential. I don't care that I have opportunities. I just want to die after putting it off for so long.

I hope people care less seeing that I'm an adult. Just to see that I'm just another cog in the machine.

Edit: this got a lot of attention wow. Thank you guys so much for the support! Especially right now when I'm gonna start college soon. This has really got me to think about where I'm going with this and I'm gonna try and get it out of my system. Even tho these thoughts might come back, at least I know where to go when they do.
