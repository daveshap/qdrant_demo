PATTERSON: I didn't have a chance to thank you.
REDBEARD: What did I do?
PATTERSON: Got me out of trouble.
REDBEARD: Nonsense- Samuel would have done something.
PATTERSON: We need to talk.
REDBEARD: Let me save time- you are the engineer; you are in charge; you're sorry I'm here. Right so far? Good- because I am not an engineer, I don't want to be in charge, and I'm sorrier than you are that I'm here- I hate Tsavo. So I will help you by killing the lions and leaving, and you will help me by doing what I tell you so I can leave. See any problems?
PATTERSON: Actually, no.
REDBEARD: All right- let's go into battle. I'm Redbeard.
PATTERSON: Somehow I guessed.
REDBEARD: Starting now, we attack them.
ABDULLAH: How; we don't know where they are?
REDBEARD: We'll have to make them come to us, won't we? And since there are two of them, we're going to set two plans in motion. First: we must move the entire hospital by tomorrow night.
HAWTHORNE: That's a terrible idea-
REDBEARD: -is it, I'm sorry, but then, of course, you're the doctor, you should know.
HAWTHORNE: Silliest thing I ever heard of- why in the world should we go through all that?
REDBEARD: I suppose I could answer you. I suppose I could explain that the place is so inviting, what with the smell of blood and flesh, that they have to strike. It's even possible that I tell you I found some fresh paw marks around back which means they're already contemplating feasting here. But I don't want to answer you because when you question me you are really saying that I don't have the least idea what I am doing, that I am nothing but an incompetent, that I am a fool. Anyone who finds me a fool, please say so now.
HAWTHORNE: I have been desperate for Patterson to let me move the hospital since the day he arrived.
REDBEARD: Then we agree.
SAMUEL: Soon.
PATTERSON: I have to ask- why do you need me?
REDBEARD: I don't really. But understand something- even though it may take me two or three days to sort this out- -when I'm gone, you'll still have to build the bridge. And I don't want the men to have lost respect for you.
PATTERSON: That's very considerate.
REDBEARD: I'm always considerate- my mother taught me that.
REDBEARD: Why do you laugh?- you don't believe she taught me?
SAMUEL: I don't believe you had a mother.
PATTERSON: You like him, don't you?
SAMUEL: Oh yes. But it takes time.
PATTERSON: You've known him long?
SAMUEL: Since his beard was red.
SAMUEL: How many cattle?
REDBEARD: Four should do it.
SAMUEL: They will want a lot of money.
PATTERSON: Have you got it?
REDBEARD: No, but you do- -see, you were needed after all. And fifty warriors at the camp before dawn.
SAMUEL: Why so many?
REDBEARD: Because I have two plans to kill the lions- one involving the cattle, the other the men.
