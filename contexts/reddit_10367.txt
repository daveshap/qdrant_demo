My secret suicidal thoughts are getting worse. It's getting harder to disobey. And I dont want to tell anyone
I'm one of those super annoying people pleaser types. I'm constantly doing favors. Listening to other people's problems. And forever smiling and trying to keep the positive vibes going.

I'm worse than just all that though. Because im an airhead and I dont have good social skills. I'm always saying or doing something stupid. And it makes me more awkward. I act like it's all good and I'm happy and it doesnt phase me. But that is so far from the truth. 

Every single day I'm plagued by thoughts of how weak I am and how I'm annoying and how I'm a bitch and "I need to die" over and over and over. Which turns into "I wanna kill myself" over and over. It's getting worse every day. I dont expect help. I just needed a place to vent.
