What are the arguments for and against Canada being a national security threat to U.S. steel production?
President Trump [recently imposed steel tariffs on several countries](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/trump-imposes-steel-and-aluminum-tariffs-on-the-european-union-canada-and-mexico/2018/05/31/891bb452-64d3-11e8-a69c-b944de66d9e7_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.be2c1ad54bdf) on the basis that steel imports harm national security. 


----------------------------

It has been [well reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/23/business/trump-tariffs-foreign-autos.html) that the President of the United States has broad authority to impose tariffs on products that detract from U.S. national security.

> The statute gives the president broad authority to restrict imports that threaten national security.

Bolstering his position, President Trump has cited [a report](https://www.commerce.gov/sites/commerce.gov/files/the_effect_of_imports_of_steel_on_the_national_security_-_with_redactions_-_20180111.pdf) published by the U.S. Department of Commerce that asserts steel imports harm national security in the long run.

However the Commerce Department report addresses Canada directly:

> Our goal is to maximize domestic capabilities combined with supplies from unquestionably reliable third parties. The one supplier in whom I have complete confidence is Canada. Not only do we currently have a steel surplus with Canada, but we share a border and have synergistic strategic, economic, and national security interests. However, treating Canada as a unique partner under any Section 232 relief measures requires that Canada also strengthen and align its trade enforcement efforts with ours. [Appendix F, p.60]

This seems to indicate Canada and the United States share a special relationship in regards to trade, and steel specifically, and also seems to weaken the argument (while not entirely) that Canada is a threat to U.S. national security of steel production.

---------------------------------

These broad arguments for and against understanding Canada as a threat to U.S. steel production all come from the Commerce Department, and quite frankly they are a bit confusing.  Including additional domestic and foreign reports/sources, what are the arguments for and against Canada being a threat to U.S. steel production? 

---- This question is very limited - I do not want to raise the significantly more complicated question of whether this is good idea for *the overall relationship* between the U.S. and Canada. This already seems to be very much in the public discussion, and I think in this case will side track from the question.
