What is technical meaning of point in time recovery? Please can I have a technical meaning of point in time recovery? Does it mean that given a backup file, we must be able to recover upto any point in time during the span of the time covered by the backup?If so, then is it right to say only a transaction log backup will allow for this? Or is only full or differential backup sufficient? How about recovery models - is full recovery model a must? Or can it be bulk recovery model also?
