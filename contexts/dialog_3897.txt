HEATHER: We are being fucked with here, someone or something.
NICK: Domini.
HEATHER: Why in the world would <u>she</u>--
NICK: --why in the world would she just fly the coop in the first place?
COTTER: Chrissake: why <u>any</u> of this?
NICK: I think it's time to get out of here.
HEATHER: Nobody's going anywhere--
COTTER: --hell, I don't think I'm ever leaving this place again--
HEATHER: --one of us, all of us--I have no idea--brought whatever this thing is back here. We're not going to go out there and spread it around like Typhoid Mary. We're gonna figure it out, we're gonna bring a goddamn <u>end</u> to it.
NICK: Domini's the only logical explanation.
HEATHER: We're not dealing with fucking logic here!
COTTER: It's Domini, it's not Domini, I don't care--all I know is <u>I'm</u> not dealing with something--<u>anything</u>-- snuffing me in my sleep. I want to do what we did in the woods-- surveillance of this whole place 24/7, with somebody monitoring those cameras every second. There's something, somebody here, I want to see 'em coming.
NICK: I thought all your equipment got stolen.
COTTER: All the shit that was worth anything, yes. You'd be amazed, though, what you can get free on the 'net.
