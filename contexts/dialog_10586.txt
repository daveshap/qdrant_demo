DOC: Do what I tell you, it's not a game.
CAROL: It's all a game, don't bother me.
DOC: We better stick here till tonight.
CAROL: Yeah.
DOC: We're going to make it.
CAROL: Sure...
DOC: I want to say something.
CAROL: I don't want to hear it.
DOC: Listen to me. It's hard enough.
DOC: Look, what you said yesterday... I guess that was right. It isn't worth anything if we don't make it together.
CAROL: I don't think we can any more... If we ever get out of here, maybe I should take off...
DOC: We got this far.
CAROL: We've come a lot of miles. But we're not close to anything.
DOC: I guess you're right.
CAROL: I always thought jails make people hard. Not you. You're just not tough enough to forget about Beynon. I chose you, not him.
DOC: Either we pick it up or else we leave it right here. We got to go one way or another.
CAROL: No more about Beynon.
DOC: Whatever happens it's over.
CAROL: Sounds good.
DOC: You want to try with me?
CAROL: Things can't get much worse can they?
DOC: I don't see how.
CAROL: Okay.
DOC: You and me.
CAROL: Can we make it?
DOC: We get to Mexico, we can have a life.
CAROL: That's all I want... It's the only thing I have ever wanted.
