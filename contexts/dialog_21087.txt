STEW: Anne, come here. Listen—
ANNE: Look out for my lipstick, Stewart.
STEW: I'll tell you what. Let's you and me sneak out all by ourselves—
ANNE: Are you crazy?
STEW: Think of the fun we can have - we'll sneak down the back stairs and get in the valet's Ford. How's that?
ANNE: Will you stop being silly, Stewart?
STEW: I'll tell you what let's do - I'll take you and introduce you to all my gang. Would you like that?
ANNE: But I don't want to meet your gang.
STEW: I don't mean the newspaper fellows that you don't like. Another gang I know - you'd love them. They're writers and musicians and artists - a great crowd of people - people who do great things. People who are worthwhile.
ANNE: Meaning, my friends aren't worthwhile, I suppose?
STEW: Oh, they're all right, Anne. But I—
ANNE: That's exactly what you mean. Heaven knows you've made that clear to me often enough. Well, I'm sick and tired of it. I've given you party after party - I've taken you to some of the best houses in this town - and introduced you to people of importance - and are you grateful? No! You insult them and act like a bore. I'm sick and tired of having to make excuses for you and the things that you've done. Perhaps it's just as well you're not coming tonight. Maybe I can enjoy myself for once without having to worry about you, and what you're going to do.
