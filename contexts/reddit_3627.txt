Does anyone else feel Black Mirror-esque that our dating lives are dictated by some unknown algorithm developed by corporations?
Most of these dating apps are owned by one company, and their algorithm is being kept secret to the public, we have no idea how the apps decide to show us the profiles that we see, and how we are being rated by the apps. We are essentially told by these apps who we see and who to match with, why are we so complacent to a corporation dictating such an important part of our lives? I think there should be some transparency on exactly how these apps work.
