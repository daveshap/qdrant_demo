WILL: What do you want to talk about?
HAP: You know what about.
WILL: We'll talk when we get back to Seattle.
HAP: When's that, a week? Two weeks?... We have to figure out a plan of action now.
WILL: You know my plan of action.
HAP: To do nothing.
WILL: That's right.
HAP: Dammit, Will. Warfield had me locked up in his office again for five hours yesterday. <i>Five</i> hours. Asking all kinds of questions...
WILL: He's asking everybody questions.
HAP: But he's zeroing in on <i>me</i>. On <i>us</i>. Everyone's talking about it.
WILL: He's just rattling your cage.
HAP: Well, I gotta tell you. With a wife, three kids, and a pension plan in the balance, it's rattling hard.
WILL: We say nothing. It goes away. Simple as that.
