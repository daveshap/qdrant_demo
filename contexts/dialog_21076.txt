GALLAGHER: Mr. Smith, I've read some of your plays and I'd like an autograph.
STEW: Well, well! If it isn't my old friend! Turn around, gal! Let's get a look at you.
GALLAGHER: There you areâ€”!
STEW: Well, daughter of the slums - how did you get out of the ghetto?
GALLAGHER: I'm pinch-hitting for our society editor tonight. I wanted to see some life in the raw.
STEW: Aw, you wanted to see some life in the raw, huh? Well gal, I'm afraid we ain't got no raw life up here.
GALLAGHER: Well, I'll have to look someplace else.
STEW: No, no! Maybe we could interest you in some well done butterflies, or perhaps some slightly fried pansies, or better still, some stuffed shirts. And guaranteed every one of them will give you a good stiff pain in the neck.
GALLAGHER: Say, who's been tying your ties lately? It looks rotten.
STEW: Gee Gallagher, do you look good! What are you doing to yourself?
GALLAGHER: Nothing.
STEW: What did you do to that hair? And where did you get that dress?
GALLAGHER: I dyed one and washed the other.
STEW: Oh, you dyed one and washed the other. Well! You certainly look good.
GALLAGHER: Don't turn around now - but there's a very beautiful girl up there who seems to be staring at us.
STEW: Staring at us?
GALLAGHER: My mistake - she's glaring.
STEW: Must be my wife.
