My girlfriend broke up with me for a chance at getting back together with her ex.
She thought she had a chance at getting back together with her ex boyfriend (she didn't), and now cuts herself because she hurt my feelings and thinks she is a terrible person. I am being a good friend to her, and she says she is not and never has been suicidal, but I know that she is harming herself.
