DEBO: Here's the plan. You gonna call over there and say you have a very urgent message for Mr. William Jones.
EZAL: What urgent message?
DEBO: If you shut up I'll tell you. The urgent message is...Drop everything! Craig is in trouble. Come quick, don't call.
EZAL: That ain't gonna work.
DEBO: Just do it.
EZAL: I don't know the number.
