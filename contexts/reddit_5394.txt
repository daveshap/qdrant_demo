I was given an end of year bonus, but also put on performance improvement plan?
I work at a small company with around 7 people, I've been working here for almost a year. Yesterday, the owner gave me an end of year bonus, but also said that there are a lot of things I need to learn, and that I would be put on a "program" which I assume is a performance improvement plan? 

I've been reading online, it looks like if you are put on a performance improvement plan, it basically means that they are preparing to fire you?

Can someone help me interpret this situation?
