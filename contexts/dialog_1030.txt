MARGO: Who's left out there?
LLOYD: Too many. And you've got a new guest. A movie star from Hollywood.
MARGO: Shucks. And my autograph book is at the cleaners.
MARGO: You disapprove of me when I'm like this, don't you?
LLOYD: Not exactly. Sometimes, though, I wish I understood you better.
MARGO: When you do, let me in on it.
LLOYD: I will.
MARGO: How's the new one coming?
LLOYD: The play? All right, I guess...
MARGO: Cora." She's - still a girl of twenty?"
LLOYD: Twentyish. It isn't important.
MARGO: Don't you think it's about time it became important?
LLOYD: How do you mean?
MARGO: Don't be evasive.
LLOYD: Margo, you haven't got any age.
MARGO: Miss Channing is ageless. Spoken like a press agent.
LLOYD: I know what I'm talking about, after all they're my plays...
MARGO: Spoken like an author. Lloyd, I'm not twentyish. I am not thirtyish. Three months ago, I was forty years old. Forty. Four oh. That slipped out, I hadn't quite made up my mind to admit it. Now I feel as if I'd suddenly taken all my clothes off...
LLOYD: Week after week, to thousands of people, you're as young as you want...
MARGO: ... as young as they want, you mean. And I'm not interested in whether thousands of people think I'm six or six hundred-
LLOYD: Just one person. Isn't that so? You know what this is all about, don't you? It has very little to do with whether you should play Cora" - it has everything to do with the fact that you've had another fight with Bill."
