CORA: Thank you for saving my life.
GRANT: That's what they pay me for.
CORA: A great deal more than that, I believe...
GRANT: Such as?
CORA: Keeping an eye on Dr. Duval...
GRANT: What gives you that idea?
CORA: That's why you're really here. I knew it from the start.
GRANT: As obvious as that? Our Security people will jump for joy. I suppose Duval's onto me, too?
CORA: You're not the first, but he's much too innocent, much too involved with his work, to realize what's going on around him.
GRANT: Under a cloud without cause, I take it.
CORA: Oh, no. Plenty of cause. He won't follow the herd, or change his convictions -- even when they're not popular. And he believes in an absolutely free interchange of information between scientists of different countries -- and these days, there's nothing more suspicious than that.
GRANT: Depends on which end of the telescope you look through.
CORA: What do you mean?
GRANT: Well, if you happen to be very fond of him -- even in love with him -- it would certainly affect your point of view.
