DR. JUDD: I've come from Jacqueline. She needs money.
GREGORY: I thought you told me you didn't know where she was.
DR. JUDD: I didn't. She came to me a few days ago. To put it delicately her care imposes a financial burden upon me. She thought you might lighten that burden.
GREGORY: If Jacqueline wants money she can come to me herself.
DR. JUDD: I'm afraid she can't do that, Ward. It would endanger her.
GREGORY: What sort of danger?
