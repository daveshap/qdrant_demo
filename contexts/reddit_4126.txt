I'm done with online dating! Does anyone else feel like it brings so much negativity into their life??
I'm 27F, and I've never really been on a relationship due to the way I was raised. I've always been shy, and I never made any efforts on meeting people. Relationships were never really on my mind until lately. 


I've spent years working on myself, I successfully became a mechanical engineer, I'm proud of myself and what I've accomplished. I worked on improving myself the last few years, I'm more outgoing, stopped being afraid of going out of my comfort zone, I enjoy my own company, and I like spending time with people as well and meeting new people. I take care of myself, I dress nicely, I look nice, I have a great body shape. 


And I figured, since I'm in a good place with myself, I could try putting myself more out there, and go on dates. 


My friends suggested dating apps. So I went for it with no expectations at first but to meet new people, go on dates and see where it all goes.


First of all, I can not go on dates with multiple people at the same time! For all of you who can, I don't know how you can give your energy to many people at the same time...


So I only met with 3 guys in total (not at the same time, these stories are at least 1 month apart), the rest I match with they either don't even talk, were just passing by the city and by the time you match they're 500 miles away, or straight up start telling you what they want to do to you (gross)!

So with the first guy, we dated for 3 months. We were intimate too. Last time we saw each other, he didn't stop telling me how much he'd love to see me again. Then after that begun the fade away, saying he's too busy. I gave up at some point... then asked him months later why he disappeared without saying anything. He simply said that "we didn't owe each other anything".

Second guy I met, he texted and talked a LOT! We met the first time, it all went well. Then we kept talking and texting each other after that, he seemed so into me. And the way he was talking about his last relationships, he didn't seem like the type who dates around. We had plans to meet a week later. 


The day of the date. He texed me in the morning, and started a normal conversation like always. He told me that he went out for a drink the night before then went back home and "slept like a baby". 

We kept talking through the day about random stuff (we were supposed to meet the same evening). Then at some point I asked him if he was still keen to meet up. He then said "the truth is, I went out for a drink with a girl last night, and she ended up spending the night at my place, so I don't think it would be appropriate to meet tonight".... B*TCH! And why didn't you say it earlier to cancel the damn date?? (Actually asked this in a calm way). He said that he didn't know how things will evolve with her, and so he didn't say anything.


I felt like I was an option, or like it's whoever agreed on having sex first...then what's the point on going on a date and getting to know the person if all you're looking for is a hole. 

But what really pissed me off, is the fact that he kept avoiding saying anything about it until last minute, and didn't even think about canceling the date before. 


But then ok, I guess I should be at least glad he didn't lie and date us both at the same time.

The 3rd and last guy, I met him last friday. The date was great! We had so much in common, we liked the same stuff and we were both surprised to find out. He looked like he had a really great time, and while we were walking after dinner, he kissed me in a very smooth way. We made out again later before parting ways. We kept texting each other the next day. It all seemed like it was going well until he sent me out of nowhere "friday was really fun, but I'd like to leave it at that"...  I know for a fact that he didn't meet anyone in between. It's fine, but I just don't get where it all went wrong!

I know that what happened to me are things that normally happen. Especially with online dating. But I just can't get how this all works, and it's tiring! 

I hate how getting rejected suddenly started affecting my self esteem and my mood! And I don't know how to deal with that. I feel jaded, and tired, and I have no desire to meet anyone or put anymore efforts on that.

I've had my share of online dating, and I'm done with it.


PS: This is more of a rant, but if you have any advice that I could use, I would appreciate it.
