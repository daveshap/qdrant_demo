DONOVAN: Hard to resist, isn't it? The Holy Grail's final resting place described in detail!
INDY: What good is it? This Grail Tablet speaks of deserts and mountains and canyons. Pretty vague. Where do you start looking? Maybe if the Tablet were intact, you'd have something to go on. But the entire top portion is missing.
DONOVAN: Just the same, an attempt to recover the Grail is currently underway.
DONOVAN: Let me tell you another bedtime story
INDY: I've heard this one as well. Two of these brothers walked out of the desert one hundred and fifty years after having found the Grail and began the long journey back to France. But only one of them made it. And before dying of extreme old age, he supposedly imparted his tale to a -- to a Franciscan friar, I think.
DONOVAN: Not supposedly
DONOVAN: This is the manuscript in which the friar chronicled the Knight's story... it doesn't reveal on location of the Grail, I'm afraid... but the Knight promised that two markers" that had been left behind would. This Tablet is one of those "markers." It proves the Knight's story is true. But as you pointed out -- it's incomplete. Now
INDY: That's usually when the ground falls out from underneath your feet.
DONOVAN: You could be more right than you know.
INDY: Yes?
DONOVAN: We've hit a snag. Our project leader has vanished. Along with all his research. Uh, we received a cable from his colleague, Doctor Schneider, who has no idea of his whereabouts or what's become of him. I want you to pick up the trail where he left off. Find the man and you will find the Grail.
INDY: You've got the wrong Jones, Mister Donovan. Why don't you try my father?
DONOVAN: We already have. Your father is the man who's disappeared.
