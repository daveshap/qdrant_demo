Fighting the Beast
I've been dealing with depression and anxiety for years.  Ever since I was raped when I was 8.  I've been told that I'm bipolar.  The only thing that saved me from committing suicide was music.  I made this video last year that really spoke about some of the demons I was fighting using a Gorilla as my body and face to represent the beast.  I've been ashamed to share these things in the past but I think I have a responsibility as a musician to be honest about everything I go through.
