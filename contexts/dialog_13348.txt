NATHAN: Aha! Finally. I've covered almost the entire seaboard and parts of eastern Ohio.
LILA: Ugnh.
PUFF: Ugnh.
NATHAN: Oh please, is that as articulate as you can be after all the time I spent teaching you? We've discussed Wittgenstein, for Christ's sake. Not that you ever had anything very original or challenging to say on the subject.
PUFF: Unn.
NATHAN: Down from the tree. Both of you. Keep your hands where I can see them. Don't want you pulling any weapons out of your fur.
NATHAN: Look at you two. You both disgust me.
LILA: Oook. Oook.
NATHAN: Shut up! I gave you... life. I created you in my image, Puff. I took you from this primordial ooze and brought you into the world of culture and art and manners. And this is how you repay me? By heading back to the ooze first chance you get? I should leave you here with Lila the ape woman. It would serve you right, you ungrateful piece of crap. But I'm not going to. You're too valuable to me. Totally selfish of me. You serve my purpose. But if you had any smarts you would realize that I serve your purpose as well. Life is so much more delightful when lived in a silk suit.
LILA: Ooka.
NATHAN: Don't worry, Lila. You can stay. I don't have any interest in you anymore. C'mon, monkey boy.
