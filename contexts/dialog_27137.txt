D'AGOSTA: Who are you? The undertaker?
PENDERGAST: Special Agent Pendergast. FBI.
D'AGOSTA: Vince D'Agosta. Am I out?
PENDERGAST: Not at all. I think we may be working on the same case. If so, I could use your help.
PENDERGAST: The body?
D'AGOSTA: What's left of it.
PENDERGAST: Mind if I have a look?
D'AGOSTA: We need light in here, stat.
PENDERGAST: Where's the head?
D'AGOSTA: Careful. That mess on the ground is brains.
PENDERGAST: Whose footprints?
D'AGOSTA: Night watchman who found the body. Sweet old man. Been tossing his cookies for over an hour. Not a likely suspect.
