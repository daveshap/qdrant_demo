SMITH: You can't do that.
STARCK: The law of relativity prohibits faster- than-light travel...
WEIR: Relativity, yes. We can't break the law of relativity, but we can go around it. The ship doesn't really move faster than the speed of light; it creates a dimensional gateway that allows the ship to instantaneously jump" from one point in the universe to another
STARCK: How?
WEIR: Well, in layman's terms, you use a rotating magnetic field to focus a narrow beam of gravitons; these in turn fold space-time consistent with Weyl tensor dynamics until the space- time curvature becomes infinitely large and you have a singularity...
