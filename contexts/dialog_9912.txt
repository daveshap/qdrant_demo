HARRY: Oh, God! Let's get her out of here tonight, right now! Let's take her with us!
DOCTOR: The hearing's tomorrow. If she gets out legally, they can't come after her.
HARRY: Look at her! She'll never pass that sanity test tomorrow...
DOCTOR: I'm taking care of that, Harry. Just hold her. Reserpine. I guarantee you this'll clear her head. She'll wake up feeling smart and sailright through the hearing.
