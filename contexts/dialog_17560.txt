LEONARD: Mrs. Jankis, what do you want from me?
MRS. JANKIS: I want you to forget the company you work for for thirty seconds, and tell me if you really think that Sammy is faking his condition.
LEONARD: I believe that Sammy should be physically capable of making new memories.
MRS. JANKIS: Thank you.
LEONARD: She seemed to leave happy. I thought I'd helped her.
