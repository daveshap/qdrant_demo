CARLA: The prices are going up.
BOB: But, that's the way of the world, huh? Everybody's gotta eat. Way of the world.
BOB: Well, I'm pretty impolite. Would you like some?
CARLA: I don't eat vegetables.
BOB: Well, I can offer you something to drink?
CARLA: Sure, what have you got?
BOB: What do you drink?
CARLA: Bourbon and Milk.
BOB: How old are you?
CARLA: 
BOB: Then I hope you wouldn't tell anyone that I gave you this.
CARLA: I wouldn't tell anyone anything that happened between me and somebody who was my friend.
BOB: Nice town that you've got here.
CARLA: You want to see it better, we could go out on the roof.
BOB: ...wouldn't that be dangerous?
CARLA: ...not if you've got something to hold on to.
