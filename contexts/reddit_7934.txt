How do you do scientific illustrations?
I'm a PhD student and I would say my biggest roadblock is making good scientific illustrations. I wanted to know how other people in grad school deal with this? Are you very proficient at Photoshop/Illustrator? Do you use a third-party and pay them? Or do you have support from your school? 

I try my best on Photoshop and Illustrator but it takes me a long time and it doesn't look as good as some of the ones I see in Nature and Science.
