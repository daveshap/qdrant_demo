How to decide bypass emitter resistance value? This is an amplifier which has voltage gain of 50, quiescent current 1 mA and the input is signals from 20 Hz to 20 kHz. I calculated the collector current which is 1 mA, using that I calculated emitter resistor value which is 1 kohms. Now how did he decide the resistor values of emmiter as 180 ohm and 820 ohm when emitter resistance is 1 kohm?
