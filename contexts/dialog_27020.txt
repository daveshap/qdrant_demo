THEO: Well, it wasn't me. Mister Dudley had to clean it and he knows that he's in charge of all the messes so why would he make more work for himself and... You said the Good Doctor was with you.
NELL: I don't know what to think anymore.
THEO: Just think about one thing right now: What color?
NELL: I've never had a pedicure before.
THEO: Well?
NELL: Red. What else?
NELL: I'm sorry I was mad at you, Theo.
THEO: Me too. Although I learned one thing about you, that you don't know about yourself. You can be a pretty decent bitch.
NELL: I'll take that as a compliment. In the city, what kind of place do you live in?
THEO: I have a loft.
