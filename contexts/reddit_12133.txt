I'm a sad boy today : (
I just lost one of my best clients : (

I kinda messed up a job

I apologized and offered to do anything they may think necessary to regain their trust,

but I'm not hopeful

Update: Not so sad anymore!

They decided to give me another chance, I will have to do a smaller job, as a test, and Insisted to do it free of cost, to show that I'm serious about it,

I'm doing this right!
