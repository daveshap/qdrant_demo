SAM: What thing?
LILA: Huh?
SAM: What thing could we be in together?
LILA: I hate tears.
SAM: Is Mary... in trouble?
LILA: Yes.
SAM: Well why didn't she come to me... call me...?
LILA: Not that kind... You men and your egos.
SAM: Never mind my ego. Let's talk about Mary.
ARBOGAST: Let's all talk about Mary.
SAM: Who are you, friend?
ARBOGAST: Milt Arbogast, Private Investigator. Where is she, Miss Crane?
LILA: I don't know.
ARBOGAST: Wouldn't have been able to tail you if you did.
SAM: What's your interest?
ARBOGAST: Money.
SAM: Somebody better tell me what's going on and tell me fast! I can take so much and then...
ARBOGAST: Your girl friend stole forty thousand dollars.
SAM: Why?
ARBOGAST: Must've needed it.
SAM: What are you talking about? What is this?
