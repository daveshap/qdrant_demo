You are more than the sum of your finances.
The holiday season can be rough, especially for people going through hard times, so I wanted to remind you: 

You are not your money. 

You are a person- a *real* person. You have skills, and dreams, and potential, regardless of your net worth. You have value, even if you can't see it right now.  

So if you see an opportunity, don't pass it up just because you feel you're undeserving. If you want to help someone, a sympathetic ear is free, and can make a world of difference. And if you need help, don't be ashamed to reach out. 

You're worth it.
