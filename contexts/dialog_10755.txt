MAXINE: May I ask what you're doing?
ENID: Shhh!
MAXINE: I want to know what you think you're doing, staying out all night and worrying your father to death!
ENID: Oh yeah, like he even noticed.
MAXINE: Listen, young lady... I know you don't like me -- I don't really care whether you do or not -- but I will not allow you to treat your father the way you do.
SEYMOUR: I really want to talk to you. I've been thinking about what you said about moving in here...
ENID: I can treat him any way I want to - I'm an adult! Leave me alone!
REBECCA: Hello?
ENID: I need to talk to you.
ENID: I'm sorry about the other day. I don't know what's wrong with me... I really do want to move in with you.
REBECCA: I don't know... I was thinking maybe I should live alone. I decided to rent that place we looked at. I'm moving in next week.
ENID: Please let me come with you. Please please please...
REBECCA: I don't know - I'm not sure it's a good idea.
ENID: Of course it's a good idea... it's our plan.
REBECCA: But how are you gonna pay rent and everything? You don't even have a job.
ENID: I'll get a job tomorrow, I promise. If I don't, you can totally tell me to fuck off.
DAD: Pumpkin, are you in there?
ENID: Are you going to yell at me?
DAD: About what?
DAD: Yeah, I heard about that.
ENID: I was in a horrible mood - tell her not to worry, I'll be completely out of her life in a few days.
DAD: She understands what you're going through and she really wants to help you. She says that job at Computer Station is still available if you want it.
ENID: I-I'm not sure... yeah, maybe.
DAD: Actually, I was just checking to see if you were here - your friend Seymour is on his way up.
ENID: What do you mean on his way up"!?"
DAD: I just buzzed him in.
ENID: What's wrong with you?! Tell him I'm not here!
DAD: But I can't --
ENID: JUST DO IT!
