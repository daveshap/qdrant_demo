DENISE: Don't be such a fucking smart ass.
MARY: Yeah, it's really your fault that we're stuck in this shithole in the first place.
JERRY: Oh, don't worry she didn't get offended by what I said. You two got to lighten up... right, Bill?
BILL: Whatever, at this point all I care about is food. I'm starving and I got a fucking killer headache.
JERRY: Hey, I asked you if you wanted some chicken.
BILL: Didn't look like chicken to me, more like fried pussy cat.
JERRY: Tasted pretty good.
