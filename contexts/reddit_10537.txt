I planned a get together to see my friends one last time and no one came
I didn’t tell them why I wanted to hang out and I planned it a while ago so it wasn’t last minute. Everyone flaked. I try not to be a downer when they’re around. I honestly don’t think anyone knows how depressed I’ve been these past few months and I don’t know how to tell anyone. I had a therapist who I’d get all this stuff out to but she left so I haven’t been able to talk to anyone about how hopeless and useless I’ve felt in almost 7 months. I don’t feel like it’s fair to dump it all on my friends and even if I felt I could go to them I don’t know how to tell them.
I’ve planned to jump from a bridge on Monday January 21st. It’ll been cold enough that if I manage to survive the fall I’ll freeze to death in the river. Tomorrow I’m gonna watch the lunar eclipse alone. I’ve always liked stargazing.
Sorry, I have no one to talk to so I’m just shouting into the internet void again. If you’re reading, thank you for giving me a couple minutes of your time 

EDIT: I’m sorry if I’m not responding to some people. I really appreciate your support and I’m trying to but for some reason I get a notification of a comment but it doesn’t appear in the tread. I’m really sorry I promise I’m not trying to be ungrateful or anything 

EDIT 2: I really appreciate the support from all of you. I didn’t think this would get so many responses and I’m really sorry if I don’t respond to some because it’s a tad overwhelming. I did read every one and I just want thank you guys for listening to me for a minute.
