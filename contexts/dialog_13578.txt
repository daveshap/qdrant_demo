ELSA: The last time I saw your father we were in the library. He was very close to tracking down the Knight's Tomb. I've never seen him so excited. He was as giddy as a schoolboy.
INDY: Who? Attila the Professor? He was never giddy, even when he was a schoolboy!
INDY: Fraulein -- will you permit me?
ELSA: I usually don't.
INDY: I usually don't either.
ELSA: In that case, I permit you.
INDY: It would make me very happy.
ELSA: But I'm already sad -- by tomorrow it will have faded.
INDY: Tomorrow I'll steal you another.
