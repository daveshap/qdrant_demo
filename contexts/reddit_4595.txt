I’m a high school senior and I’ve officially lost everything I’ve had to look forward to
I’m 17 years old from Texas, in my senior year of high school and after working so hard and having some of the hardest years of my life through high school I was really looking forward to seeing all my hard work pay off, but now I’m not getting that opportunity just like so many others. When the whole corona virus stuff started I never though it would hit this close to my home and that it would have this big of an impact on everything, I had already paid for my cap and gown and had my senior pictures done and even my invitations were ready to go but now the pictures and invitations are all in a box in my parents closet. I think the worst part about this is that no one seems to care and when it’s brought to their attention all they have to say is some shit like “Oh sorry, life happens” what the hell am I supposed to do with that? I worked so hard to keep my depression under control but this has just put me at a whole new low and I don’t know what’s going to happen to me if I can’t find some help from someone soon.. I could really use some comfort and help right now...
