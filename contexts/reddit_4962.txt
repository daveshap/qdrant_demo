I need a little advice
I have met a new guy (he lives in another state) and we've grown quite fond of each other, he's an AMAZING man. Just recently he went away for about a week, and I wasn't sure why. He messaged me last night and told me he has depression. I messaged him last night saying "I'm very sorry you're going through this. I'm here for you if you ever need anything, I'll be here to listen <3" He did say "It's hard for me to reach out again when I get like this" 

Now I don't have experience with someone who has depression, so I'm asking:

How can I be there for him?

Should I let him come to me?

Should I text him to check in every day? (or is that smothering?)

What should I text him?

Any and all advice is appreciated <3
