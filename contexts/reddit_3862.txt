Why would you avoid meeting the person you have a crush on?
I am not sure if this is the right subreddit for this question. My brother(28M) has a huge crush on one of my friends(29F). Might be wishful thinking from my end but he gets very smiley when I talk about her, likes almost all of her social media posts and I saw him visibly nervous when they bumped into each other at a party. When I first noticed it, I got very excited because I do think that they have a lot of similar interests and would be very good together. However, every time I suggest that he should meet her or we should invite her over for a movie, he always declines. Last weekend she invited him for a trek (just the two of them) and he said he can't go because he has not been well (he was lying). She recently asked me if he was angry at her for some reason because of this behavior. I know he isn't because he still gets dreamy-eyed every time anyone mentions her name. I am trying to understand this behavior and wondering if anyone else does it too. Is it common? Is it just nervousness? Should I confront my brother about it, we don't really talk a lot about our personal lives.

These two have known each other for over 6 months now and have only met in person twice, but have had multiple text conversations.
