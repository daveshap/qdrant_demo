THEO: I'm here. Where are you?
MALE VOICE: We don't see you.
THEO: I'm three quarters of the way up the lot behind the concession stand.
MALE VOICE: Stay there.
THEO: I don't want you within two hundred feet. Park down by the lifeguard station. Nobody gets out.
MALE VOICE: It's your call.
THEO: Fucking A" it is! Any argument and I'm out of here."
MALE VOICE: Just relax.
THEO: I don't need to relax. The woman. Put her on.
MALE VOICE: You'll see her.
THEO: I don't want to see her later. I want to hear her <u>now</u>.
MALE VOICE: Talk to the man.
LENORE: Thank you. God bless you for helping us.
THEO: Are you okay?
LENORE: They wrapped tape around my wrists and ankles.
THEO: That's coming off. How about the girl?
LENORE: She's awake but she hasn't spoken. I don't know what they did to her. I don't want to think about it.
THEO: Your husband?
LENORE: He's in back. Lying face down. They haven't hurt him anymore -- but he was crying. I never heard Jack cry before --
THEO: You're all three of you in that van?
LENORE: Yes.
THEO: Now you're going to do just what I tell you to. No discussion. No hesitation.
LENORE: Yes sir.
THEO: Put the man back on.
MALE VOICE: Satisfied?
THEO: You already tried to pull one little number on me -- and it didn't work.
MALE VOICE: I don't know what you mean.
THEO: I still don't see you.
MALE VOICE: We're waiting for the light to cross the highway. It just changed. We're in a grey van. It reads <u>Noble Carpet Cleaners</u>.""
