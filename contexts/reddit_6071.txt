Should I contact company who said I would be interviewed but they are reviewing the situation because of coronavirus (they emailed 1 month ago)
Hello,

I applied for a job in February. At the beginning of April, I received an email saying I was selected for interview but the position is being reviewed because of the coronavirus situation and they would be in touch. (I’m in the UK) 

I did not reply to this email at the time as I thought I would wait. I know they will get in contact when the situation is clearer - however, is it worth me emailing just to restate my interest - I’m worried that they may think I’m not interested still if I don’t email? They did say I could email if I would like more information.  I’m unsure about whether emailing will make me look good or whether to not bother them?

Thank you everyone.
