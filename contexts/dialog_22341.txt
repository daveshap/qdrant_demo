ROMEO: Why then, O brawling love, O loving hate, O anything of nothing first create. heavy lightness. Serious vanity. Misshapen chaos of well seeming forms.
BENVOLIO: Good-morrow, cousin.
ROMEO: Is the day so young?
BENVOLIO: But new struck cuz.
ROMEO: Ay me! Sad hours seem long. Was that my father that went hence so fast?
BENVOLIO: It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
ROMEO: Not having that, which, having, makes them short.
BENVOLIO: In love?
ROMEO: Out--
BENVOLIO: Of love?
ROMEO: Out of her favour, where I am in love.
BENVOLIO: Alas, that love, so gentle in his view, Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
ROMEO: Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still, Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will! Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here? Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all. Here's much to do with hate, but more with love. Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate! O any thing, of nothing first create! O heavy lightness! Serious vanity! Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms! Feather of lead-- [Benvolio Snickers] Dost thou not laugh?
BENVOLIO: No, cuz, I rather weep.
ROMEO: Good heart, at what?
BENVOLIO: At thy good heart's oppression.
ROMEO: Farewell, my cuz.
BENVOLIO: Soft! I will go along; An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
