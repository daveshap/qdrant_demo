Feeling emotional, decided to isolate myself.
So, I am more of using this post to act as an journal. Today Ive been feeling a bit needier than usual. What I mean by that is I want to stay and cuddle with my BF a lot more than I usually want to. This wouldn't be an issue, but I know he has to get his work done. Even though I just want his security and companionship I know that I can give myself the same thing that I am searching for in him. So, I decided to go back to my apartment because when I am at this state of mind, I get offended easily and I begin to over react over tiny things. Its kinda like my emotions are on hypersensitivity mode. I am pretty tired so I am sure my sleep deprivation and mild dehydration has something to do with it lol. I wanted to get this off my chest just because I choose to not put myself in a situation that would cause me to become overtly emotional. I am pretty happy about it. Even though I want to text and call him at this instance, I just know that I am being too needy and too dependent on him. So I write to you reddit as my outlet for my anxieties and insecurities. A little sad, but I am working on me.
