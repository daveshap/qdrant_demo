HAN: We're into the second perimeter. They'll be coming out to blast us shortly. I was wondering if you had some kind of a plan or are we going to try to blast our way in?
BEN: Check your data banks for all the information you have on Imperial procedures. Both of you will have to learn...
HAN: We're going to get in by studying Imperial procedures? I don't like it.
BEN: All right then, we'll use your plan.
HAN: I'll get the information.
BEN: ... and I want you to start cleaning the equipment out of the scan- shielded compartments.
HAN: What do you want with our scan-proof lockers?
CONTROLLER: No reply on any circuits... It's drifting on a point twenty-seven skew. It's not close enough to identify.
COMMANDER: Alert squad five, but hold them until we know what it is.
CONTROLLER: Should we alert the Sith Lords?
COMMANDER: I'll make a report later.
CONTROLLER: As close as we can make out, it appears to be a Corellian gypsy vessel... It's not under power.
COMMANDER: Send one squad up.
