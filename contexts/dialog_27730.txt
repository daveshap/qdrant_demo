MACFARLANE: Well --
FETTES: Gray killed her.
MACFARLANE: We can't be sure of that.
FETTES: I am sure. I mean to report it. It's like Burke and Hare all over again.
MACFARLANE: I wouldn't do that, Fettes. I wouldn't report it.
FETTES: Grave robbing is one thing -- this is murder.
MACFARLANE: I don't know that -- neither do you. This subject may have been an epileptic -- thrown a fit -- fallen out of bed -- cracked her skull and killed herself -- there is everything explained -- the bruise on her head --
FETTES: I can't believe that.
MACFARLANE: Believe it or not. It's best for you to pretend that you do. After all, it was you who ordered this specimen, received it here, and paid for it. That makes you a party to murder.
FETTES: But, I didn't ask him to kill.
MACFARLANE: Who would believe that? And you know, someone else might recognize her. She was as well known as the Castle Rock.
