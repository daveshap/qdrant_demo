DEIRDRE: And you believed me? But it wasn't my people who did it.
LARRY: How do we know that?
SAM: Because if they had she'd be gone along with the package, instead of sitting here with us.
DEIRDRE: Exactly. Gregor, he was the Russian's man. It was my people came up with the idea for this run, but the Russians who had the capital to finance it. Gregor, he was their insurance, and I was ours. Everybody else was supposed to be neutral. Gregor must've got to Swede...
LARRY: I never did trust that blonde fuck...
DEIRDRE: That's why you were riding with him.
VINCENT: The question still remains: what do we do now?
SAM: Gregor's cell phone...
LARRY: What are you gonna do, call him up and ask him to give us back our shit?
SAM: Did he bring that with him?
DEIRDRE: I bought it for him -- all the stuff he was using, it was in his contract. Cost a nice penny, too, especially that goddamned phone: Gregor had expensive tastes.
SAM: Check this out. Gregor's a spook, or he was one until recently. When he was a spy he lived the life -- you know, a prince in some Eastern Bloc country where nobody had shit and Gregor had everything. Then the wall goes down. No more Cold War. And Gregor is out of a job. No apartment, no special stores with Western food and video tapes. I would bet dollars against shit that Gregor liked that phone and he doesn't want to give it up. And I wouldn't be surprised if he's arrogant enough to think...
DEIRDRE: That we're too stupid to trace his calls.
