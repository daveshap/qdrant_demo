How could a time traveler have prevented climate change Let's say a Moon colonist in the future has discovered an alien time machine. A small remnant of humanity still exists on colony worlds in the solar system, but due to runaway climate change, they are extinct on Earth. What event or events would the time traveler have to change in the past in order to make sure climate change as we understand it today never happens? Oh, the time traveler would go back in time on the Moon and has a shuttle that would get him to Earth in that past period.EDIT (2-14-2019): It's clear that the basic premise of my question is flawed, since there is not one event or small number of events that, if changed, would alter the impending climate change as we understand it. Not only that, but it seems that opinion vary widely on exactly how damaging climate change will become, even if not significantly curtailed. That said, the information here could fuel quite a number of different tales, so thank you all for your input (and you don't have to stop now).
