DON CORLEONE: Bonasera, we know each other for years, but this is the first time you come to me for help. I don't remember the last time you invited me to your house for coffee...even though our wives are friends.
BONASERA: What do you want of me? I'll give you anything you want, but do what I ask!
DON CORLEONE: And what is that Bonasera?
DON CORLEONE: No. You ask for too much.
BONASERA: I ask for Justice.
DON CORLEONE: The Court gave you justice.
BONASERA: An eye for an eye!
DON CORLEONE: But your daughter is still alive.
BONASERA: Then make them suffer as she suffers. How much shall I pay you.
DON CORLEONE: You never think to protect yourself with real friends. You think it's enough to be an American. All right, the Police protects you, there are Courts of Law, so you don't need a friend like me. But now you come to me and say Don Corleone, you must give me justice. And you don't ask in respect or friendship. And you don't think to call me Godfather; instead you come to my house on the day my daughter is to be married and you ask me to do murder...for money.
BONASERA: America has been good to me...
DON CORLEONE: Then take the justice from the judge, the bitter with the sweet, Bonasera. But if you come to me with your friendship, your loyalty, then your enemies become my enemies, and then, believe me, they would fear you...
BONASERA: Be my friend.
DON CORLEONE: Good. From me you'll get Justice.
BONASERA: Godfather.
DON CORLEONE: Some day, and that day may never come, I would like to call upon you to do me a service in return.
