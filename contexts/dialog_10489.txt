KAREN: When I came upstairs, you stayed to finish your drink. I told you to turn off the TV when you were through. Come to think of it, I also told you you could sleep in the maid's room.
HARRY: Yeah, well I turned off the set. I used the remote control thing and laid it on the floor. You know what could've happened? The dog came in and stepped on it, turned the TV back on.
KAREN: I don't have a dog.
HARRY: You don't? What happened to Muff?
KAREN: Harry, are you going down, or you want me to?
HARRY: Anyone skim the pool? It needs it.
KAREN: Harry -â€“
HARRY: I'm going.
