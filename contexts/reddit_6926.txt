Weird layoff situation that kinda bugs me. Thoughts?
Hey guys, I had a weird situation at work that I wanted to talk about and get your thoughts about?

We suffered some layoffs and I was on the list for the positions eliminated, however, it appears I was on the list because I could be moved to another department pretty easily, thus saving my job, or rather, allowing multiple people to keep their jobs, including me. It wasn't about performance or anything, my manager said as much and I've performed very well over the years. I'm definitely wanted here. Me moving meant other people got to keep their jobs, and me too. 

My question is, I still feel weird about it, because I was technically on the list, but they didn't want me to be obviously and didn't want to lose me, so how am I supposed to feel about that? Like, it's like, I am relieved, and I'm not laid off like others, but I still feel like I got the dice rolled and it wasn't in my favor. They definitely tried to keep as many people as they could, save as much as they could and move them to other depts and my new manager is very happy to have me, and asked for me to join him. 

I feel kinda weird about it, relieved, and still kinda, like I was targeted for some unknown reason. Maybe it's just the situation is always rough with layoffs on why I feel this way? Any advice or thoughts you have that could possibly help ease my mind a little? Hard to see when you are experiencing things like this and the people you care about at work are too.

  
Thanks.
