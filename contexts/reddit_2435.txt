Mid 30’s feel like I wasted my time studying for something I’m not working in. Am I alone in this?
Hi everyone. So I did the whole college thing, while I was finishing my post graduate degree I started working retail. Now where I’m from retail paid really well so I stuck to that. I blinked and suddenly I was 8 years in the retail game. I finally got out and moved on to something that I thought was academics but is really a glorified call center (no hate on the company it’s just being managed really badly, and I can’t deal with it anymore). I wanted to get into the academics world because my degree is in School Psychology (MA), I’ve applied for a teaching license and have been denied, I can’t find any work right now 1. Because I have the degree but no certifications plus no experience and 2. Because of COVID (I’m in one of the high number cases states). I’m literally at my wits end and don’t know how to move on from where I’m at mentally.
