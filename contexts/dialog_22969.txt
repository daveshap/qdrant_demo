DWIGHT: Professor, I think you should see this.
PROFESSOR: What is it? Some tits? A beaver shot? What?
DWIGHT: No, these are the tapes from the living room. Check this out.
DWIGHT: The image there.
PROFESSOR: Are you sure it's not the tape?
DWIGHT: I don't think so. It's on all the cameras, and check this out. The thermal readings inside the house dropped ten degrees when the image was recorded.
PROFESSOR: Congratulations, Dwight, it's begun.
