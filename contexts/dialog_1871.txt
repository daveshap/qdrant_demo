FRAN: Are we dressing for dinner?
BUD: No -- just come as you are.
FRAN: Say, you're pretty good with that racquet.
BUD: You ought to see my backhand. And wait till I serve the meatballs.
FRAN: Shall I light the candles?
BUD: It's a must -- gracious-living-wise.
FRAN: I see you bought some napkins.
BUD: Might as well go all the way.
BUD: You know, I used to live like Robinson Crusoe -- shipwrecked among eight million people. Then one day I saw a footprint in the sand -- and there you were -- It's a wonderful thing -- dinner for two.
FRAN: You usually eat alone?
BUD: Oh, no. Sometimes I have dinner with Ed Sullivan, sometimes with Dinah Shore or Perry Como -- the other night I had dinner with Mae West -- of course, she was much younger then. Cheers.
FRAN: Cheers.
BUD: You know what we're going to do after dinner?
FRAN: The dishes?
BUD: I mean, after that?
FRAN: What?
BUD: You don't have to if you don't want to --
FRAN: I don't?
BUD: We're going to finish that gin game.
FRAN: Oh.
BUD: So I want you to keep a clear head.
