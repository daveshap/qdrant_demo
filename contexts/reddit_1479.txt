Has anyone ever vomited from having such high anxiety?
23 F. GAD/Depression/USA 

Recently I feel like my anxiety is consuming my life. I’m on no medications for it. I’ve been unable to sleep at night, I can’t calm myself down anymore. Today I was so worked up on my way to work that I started to feel sick and I didn’t even make it all the way to work before I had to pull over and get sick. It was weird because it wasn’t like a lot. Just one swift projecting vomit and then it was over. Is this a symptom of anxiety?
