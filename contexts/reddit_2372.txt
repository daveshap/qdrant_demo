"wE'vE dEcIdEd NoT tO mOvE fOrWaRd At ThIs TiMe." Is anyone else sick of reading these emails?
I'm so sick of these emails. I want to scream bloody murder everytime I open one up. I wish they would just be honest and tell me that I'm absolute trash and that's why I was rejected instead of beating around the bush. I don't know why I'm even bothering. I'm stuck in my dead end job forever and that'll be my life.

What are your guys' thoughts?
