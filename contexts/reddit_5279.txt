Is a Mutiny at work ever successful?
I currently work a state government job, and morale is pretty low at work right now because people are stating that the line of communication is awful and affects things such as, Work from Home Days, Pay increases, etc.

I overheard a few coworkers trying to plan a mutiny against the department. My question is are these ever successful? Any experiences if youâ€™ve had a mutiny at work?
