“If you try to build intimacy with another person before you have gotten whole on your own, all your relationships become an attempt to complete yourself.” – Dr. Les Parrott
34M going on one year divorced from my wife of 13 years. I still miss her, but hindsight has enabled me to see that our marriage was super codependent and sometimes flat out toxic, because we both weren’t “whole” without the other. We got married when she was 16 and neither of us knew anything about who we were as individuals, we were just IN LOVE^TM and figured that was all that we needed to succeed. Untreated mental health issues, infidelity that we tried to forget about instead of getting counseling for, self harm, threatening suicide, control issues, childhood physical/emotional/sexual abuse.... we both should have, not just “worked on” our issues, but sought treatment and HELP for our issues, before we ever entered the world of dating. Please, learn from my mistakes, don’t get married or have a relationship with someone because you feel like they can “complete” you. It’s one thing to complement each other’s strengths and weaknesses, sure, but at the end of the day you still need to be “complete” as a person regardless of who is in your life (or not). I’m on the journey towards that now; got me a therapist, got on some medications, got Jesus. Quit smoking, quit drinking, quit watching porn, quit playing video games. Finally finished my degree, made a plan for the next one. Started working out, stopped dressing like I live in a van near the airport; started going to church again for the first time in 20 years, stopped cussing like a sailor with Tourette’s; started playing with my kids more, stopped letting the TV babysit them.     
I’m not planning on letting up anytime soon, but for the first time in my life I feel like I sort of know who I am. And it’s a nice feeling.    
May you each be blessed with your own wholeness as well.
