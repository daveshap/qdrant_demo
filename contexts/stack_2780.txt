Usage of the word \"entropy\" The physicist and renown television personality described the 2nd law of thermal dynamics this way:<blockquote>  \"The second law of thermal dynamics is essentially a death warrant.  The amount of disorder in the universe is increasing -- meaning that  things break down, things corrode, things decay.\"</blockquote>Then I tried looking at some definitions of the 2nd law of thermal dynamics, which is essentially entropy (right?) and found this rather intuitive explanation:<blockquote>  When energy changes from one form to another form, or matter moves  freely, entropy (disorder) in a closed system increases.</blockquote>Question: If this concept applies to the universe, as articulated by Kaku, then by association/inheritance, can we use the term entropy to explain phenomenon here on earth?Example: The US military has many airplane hangars in the desert because there is less moisture in the air and the parts corrode slower and require less maintenance.Is it then fair to say that:<blockquote>  The entropy in the desert is lower than, say, at the beach (all else  held equal)?</blockquote>Now of course, corrosion and entropy may not be synonymous with each other, but again, by inheritance of the axiomatic properties of entropy, is that not a fair statement? Or will physicists object to that?
