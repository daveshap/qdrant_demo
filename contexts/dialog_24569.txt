JOE: What happened?
JERRY: I got pinched in the elevator.
JOE: Well, now you know how the other half lives.
JERRY: And I'm not even pretty.
JOE: They don't care - just as long as you wear skirts. It's like waving a red flat in front of a bull.
JERRY: I'm tired of being a flag. I want to be a bull again. Lets get out of here, Joe. Let's blow.
JOE: Blow where?
JERRY: You promised - the minute we hit Florida, we were going to beat it.
JOE: How can we? We're broke.
JERRY: We can get a job with another band. A male band.
JOE: Listen, stupid - right now Spats Colombo and his chums are looking for us in every male band in the country.
JERRY: But this is so humiliating.
JOE: So you got pinched in the elevator. So what? Would you rather be picking lead out of your navel?
JERRY: All right, all right! But how long can we keep this up?
JOE: What's the beef? We're sitting pretty. We get room and board - we get paid every week - there's the palm trees and the flying fish -
JERRY: What are you giving me with the flying fish? I know why you want to stick around - you're after Sugar.
JOE: Me? After Sugar?
JERRY: I watched you two on the bus - lovey-dovey - whispering and giggling and borrowing each other's lipstick -
JOE: What are you talking about? Sugar and me, we're just like sisters.
JERRY: Yeah? Well, I'm your fairy godmother - and I'm keeping an eye on you.
