TYLER: No thanks, I quit.
JACK: You quit?
TYLER: Yeah. Where you headed?
JACK: Work. Going to work.
JACK: What... ?
TYLER: Nothing. Do what you like.
JACK: We need to talk.
BOSS: Okay. Where to begin? With your constant absenteeism? With your unpresentable appearance? You're up for review...
JACK: I Am Jack's Complete Lack of Surprise.
JACK: Let's pretend. You're the Department of Transportation, and you discover that our company intentionally did nothing about leather seats cured in third world countries with chemicals we know cause birth defects? Brake linings that fail after a thousand miles. Fuel injectors that burn people alive.
BOSS: Just who the fuck do you think you are?! Get out! You're fired!
JACK: What about this? Keep me on payroll as an outside consultant. In exchange for my salary, I'll keep my mouth shut. I won't need to come to the office. I can do this job from home.
