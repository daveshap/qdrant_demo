Perfect Vacuum Beneath an Object Recently I became interested in how suction cups work by creating a region of space with lower pressure than their surroundings, thus sealing the suction cup to the contact surface. Extrapolating this idea further, does this mean that a cube resting on a perfectly flat surface would be unable to be lifted since by doing so, you would be creating a region with zero pressure? Also, keep in mind that I'm speaking in purely theoretical terms and I understand that no object is perfectly flat and whatnot.
