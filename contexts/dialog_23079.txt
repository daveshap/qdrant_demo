TATUM: That's mature.
STU: Where you guys been? We had to start without you.
KENNY: What's the plan?
GALE: Prep the compact, we'll hide it in a window and tape all of tonight's festivities.
KENNY: The control board's glitched. You know we can't carry a live picture.
GALE: What's the delay?
KENNY: About thirty seconds.
GALE: As long as it records I don't give a shit. We're not doing a remote.
DEWEY: Evening, ma'am.
GALE: Deputy... good evening.
DEWEY: What brings you out to these parts?
GALE: You never know when or where a story will break.
DEWEY: Not much story here. Just a bunch of kids cutting loose.
GALE: Then what are you doing here?
DEWEY: Keeping an eye on things. Checking the place out.
GALE: Mind if I join you?
