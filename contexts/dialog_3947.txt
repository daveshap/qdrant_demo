TROY: So, Adam...where on earth are you from?
EVE: Out-of-town. That's all he'll say.
ADAM: It's a very small place. People don't even know it's there.
TROY: And it's called...?
ADAM: Maybe Eve can guess. She's psychic.
TROY: Really? Since when?
EVE: Since that guy rear-ended me in Palm Springs.
TROY: Oh, yes.
EVE: I even guessed his hotel, didn't I?
ADAM: Right on the button.
TROY: Well, Dionne Warwick, guess his home town.
EVE: Give me your hand.
TROY: Oh, my God...
EVE: Okay, let's see...I'm not promising anything. You okay?
ADAM: Um-hum.
EVE: I'm seeing...snow... lots of snow. Way up North. Are we getting hot?
ADAM: Yes!
EVE: You live in...Alaska. The only way in or out of your place is by plane and... you've definitely come down here for food and supplies and... to find a wife!
ADAM: Wow.
TROY: That's right?
ADAM: I've never met anyone like you in my life.
TROY: She's right?!
