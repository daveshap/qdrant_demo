Sick online friend hasn't answered messages or calls for a day
Friend that I've met online said that he had difficulty breathing 2 days ago due to his bad sickness (cold he said), he lives by himself and didn't apparently have any medicine either. 1 day ago he said it was still hard to breathe and the sickness was getting worse (one ear losing hearing).

It's been ~24 hours since he last sent a message after we exchanged good nights and such. I've tried to send messages, call (the call reached his device, but he didn't pick up) and a normal text message incase Signal (the app we use to communicate) has problems.

I'm super anxious and worry about him, he said he'd be fine but usually we exchange atleast couple messages a day so being silent is abnormal.

Update: He finally answered! He's been asleep for a whole day, and went to sleep again, he doesn't have energy to even get off bed.. I'm still very worried and will keep checks on him until he gets better. I'm relieved that he still lives.
