KAT: You have had girlfriends?
NICK: Sure, but it’s never easy. They say they’re okay with it, and they are...for a while. Then one day, they’re not.
NICK: When I said I’d never done a wedding before, I didn’t say that no one ever asked. I just never said yes.
KAT: So, why’d you say yes to me?
NICK: There was something in your voice on the phone that day.
KAT: Desperation?
