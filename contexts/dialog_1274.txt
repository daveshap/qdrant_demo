CHOIR TEACHER: What the hell was that?
OZ: Sorry.
CHOIR TEACHER: No, it was good.
OZ: Oh, well... It came from the heart.
CHOIR TEACHER: Well then keep it coming. Alright, people, good work! Keep it up and we'll do great at the state competition.
HEATHER: Not bad, Chris.
OZ: Really? Hey, thanks -- Heather, right?
HEATHER: Yeah...so...you've got this sort of... Bobby McFerrin thing going there.
OZ: Yeah. Right, uh-huh. I feel like I've discovered this whole new side of me. Music is so expressive.
HEATHER: Okay. I mean, I agree, but...aren't you supposed to be out, like, trying to decapitate someone with your lacrosse stick or something?
OZ: Oh sure. I know what people think. It's like, Oz, he's just this kickass lacrosse player -- I also play football, by the way -- But that's like...not <u>all</u> that I am.
HEATHER: Of course, I didn't --
OZ: I mean it really bothers me when people try to pigeonhole me like that.
HEATHER: You? You think I don't get that? God, it's like just because I don't get drunk and barf every weekend, people say Oh
OZ: Yeah...so like, what else <u>do</u> you do?
HEATHER: Well the same things you do. Hang out with friends and stuff, you know, whatever. What do you think I do?
OZ: I just -- realized that I didn't know anything about you. I was interested.
HEATHER: Oh...well that's okay. Cool.
KEVIN: I was being selfish. And majorly insensitive. And I'm a total idiot.
VICKY: I think shithead" really says it."
KEVIN: Yes! I'm a shithead! I'm a complete and total shithead!
KEVIN: And I want to try to make it up to you.
VICKY: How?
