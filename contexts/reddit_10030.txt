Certification VS MA in Student Affairs (or related)
Good Afternoon Fellow Redditors,


tl;dr:

1. Is a certificate for student services/affairs worth it or should I get a post-bacc degree? I have a BA in English. I have lots of experience in the career services department but nothing else from my University.

2. Can I start from the bottom and work my way up a career ladder in this field? I am prepared and determined to do that.

I am researching a few career paths to figure out where I should go next. I graduated in May 2013 and was fortunate to get a decent job (experience-wise) right out of college. I work as the Reading Intervention Specialist at an Elementary school. Essentially I work with various students from Kinder to 3rd grade who score below grade level reading averages. I work with them on a very intriguing computer program run through Scientific Learning, and I also coordinated and manage an after school reading program.

There are many things I love about my job, but I can't stay here. I've always had an interest in Student Affairs, and there are a few jobs I've got my eye on. However, **I feel unqualified.** Some of these jobs ask for an MA, but others don't. 

[This Article](http://chronicle.com/article/Getting-a-Start-in-Student/125391/) states that getting a certificate could be an alternative route, but I don't want to waste my time. From your experience, do you think the certificate is worth the time/money, or should I look at an MA path? I already turned down a graduate school that accepted me this year. While I want to go to grad school eventually . . . It doesn't seem logical for me to get a degree in something I'm not even sure I want to do.
