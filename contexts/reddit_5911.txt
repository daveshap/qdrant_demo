Looking to change career with a Master’s
I have a Bachelor’s degree with a concentration in graphic design and photography and... it’s not for me.  

At first I was trying to break into marketing, but my work didn’t help me much and I wasn’t able to get an interview for a marketing job that did not seem scammy.

I’d like to change my career.Is there a master’s degree that I can get with my bachelor’s background that is not graphic design or heavily art related? I am struggling with my research.
