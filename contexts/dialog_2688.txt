RAWHIDE: The professor and Dr. Emilio Lizardo were actually the first to discover the Eighth Dimension. Almost fifty years ago. Before Buckaroo's parents even knew each other. But there was trouble, a rocket catapult failed and Dr. Lizardo got sucked half in, half out...when they hauled him back ,he wasn't the same guy. His hair was orange...
BUCKAROO BANZAI: And his soul black as the Ace of Spades.
RAWHIDE: He went on a senseless crime spree, killed a cop during a bank robbery, got caught and judged insane. The professor told us they threw away the key.
PERFECT TOMMY: Hey, any lock can be picked. So what's he up to?
BUCKAROO BANZAI: I'm sure we'll find out soon enough.
