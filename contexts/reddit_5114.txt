Rejection or Awaiting Decision?


I’m a high-student seeking part-time for the first time ever, please bear with me if I say something amateur-ish. 

After talking to the hiring manager for fifteen minutes and “really connecting”, I decided to apply for a position at my local ice rink. The general window for applications was a span of one month, but I applied pretty early. It’s been 3.5 weeks and the application window closed a week ago. I haven’t gotten a response and tried to get in contact with him in person, then in email. It’s been 1.5 weeks, I still don’t have a reply. I asked a bunch of people who worked there and somebody said “You should a response in a week...” and somebody else said “Yeah he does that, I had to contact him a lot to get this job”.

Did I get rejected? Is it possible that they’re reviewing applications after the application window closes? I only really want to apply here since it pays well and I’ll enjoy it, but I’m just so anxious. I know I’d only know what’s going on once I can actually get in contact with the hiring manager, but maybe I can get a little insight from Reddit while I’m waiting. 

All help appreciated, thanks.
