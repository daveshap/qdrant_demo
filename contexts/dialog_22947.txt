LLOYD: What do you want?
DIANE: I'm sorry.
LLOYD: What do you want?
DIANE: My father's guilty. He lied to me, he lied to everybody. I just left home... I need you.
LLOYD: You do?
DIANE: Everything else means nothing to me. If I hurt you again, I'll die.
LLOYD: Hurt me again? Not a chance, don't worry about it.
DIANE: I love you.
LLOYD: What?
DIANE: I love you. How many more times do I have to say it?
LLOYD: One more time would be nice.
DIANE: I love you. Please, I love you.
