No option to boot Windows in Startup Manager So basically I've got a Macbook Pro 2013 / 2014, I'm not sure which. It has a completely wiped hard drive, and I'm trying to install Windows on it. I have a Windows 10 Installer USB drive that works fine on other computers. By this I mean in other computers, the BIOS lists the USB drive as a boot option and works as expected.But in the Macbook Startup Manager (accessed by holding the option key while the computer is booting), it is not an option.If I use a live Linux USB (I've tried arch and debian) it works as expected, debian installed on the Macbook with no problems.What can I do to fix this? Also keep in mind there is no operating system installed on the system, so I can't use any OSX utilities, but I can use Linux utilities.
