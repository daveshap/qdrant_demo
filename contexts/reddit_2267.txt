The Top 30 Mistakes You Need To Avoid In Your Essay
I've seen many people ask for a list of common essay mistakes so they know what not to do.  Here's a fairly comprehensive list I've compiled based on my experience, discussions with others in admissions, and books I've read.  You would think that many of these would be self-evident or obvious, but experience indicates otherwise.  Feel free to add others or ask questions in the comments.

1.  **Don't choose a common topic.**  It's possible to write a good essay in this space but *so much more difficult* because of the sheer volume that comes in.  This includes the standard sports injury/championship, mission trip, death of a grandparent, and slightly meta "getting into this college would be the culmination of my dreams" essays.  To a lesser degree, this also includes "soup du jour" essay topics like cryptocurrency, social media, or whatever else is trending.  Yes, it is theoretically possible to have a good essay on any of these topics.  But every AO rolls their eyes and dies a little inside every time they have to read *another* one.

**2.  Make sure you write about something that is actually important to you.**  Full meta essays about college applications/grades/tests feel like they are clever and creative, but they aren't that distinctive or original.  And there's no way the college application process is *that big* of a part of who you are because you've only been doing it for ~7 months tops.  People who write about this are basically climbing on the /r/iamverysmart horse and riding it all the way to /r/im14andthisisdeep town.  Other people write about things they think AOs *want* them to write about.  What they actually want you to write about is YOU.

**3.  Don't write about super polarizing or sensitive issues.**  Don’t be dogmatic, political, religious, cult-like, overly dramatic, aggressive, racist, sexist, or argumentative.  Often you come across as somewhat crass or blunt simply because you don't have the space to explain your complex views fully enough and the topic is so delicate.  Other times your opinions clash with the deeply held views of whoever is reading your essays.  Again, it's possible to write good essays on delicate topics, but it's risky - just like killing a fly in your grandmother's house with a baseball bat.  (e.g. one student got into Stanford with a 100 word supplement on what was important to him that was just "Black Lives Matter" 33 times. But that's super risky and could have backfired badly.)  

**4.  Don't curse too much,** try too hard to incite pity or catharsis, be overly pessimistic / self-deprecating, talk about your forays into illegal/unethical activities, or do anything else dark, depressing, or weird.  You want to stand out as unique, but not like this.

**5.  Avoid using too many big words.**  Do not, repeat, *DO NOT* touch that thesaurus.  You want this essay to be **your voice**.  You're smart and you want the AO to know that, but they will already see your SAT verbal score and your transcript, so you don't need to hit them in the face with a thesaurus. Using too many big words sounds unnatural and makes it sound like you're trying to be impressive rather than expressive. Instead of coming away with "wow this guy is really passionate and a creative problem solver" they might just find you insincere, boring, and uninspiring. Big words in excess drain emotion and jar the reader out of the story and remind them that they're sitting in a windowless room evaluating essays. They are WAY overused in these essays too, and often evoke a "here we go again" sigh.  You can sound full of yourself and arrogant too.  Remember that you want to be likeable, personable, and charismatic.  These will be more impressive to an AO than people who try too hard to impress with intellect and vocabulary.

**6.  Take time to edit & review your essays.**  I've seen essays list the wrong school.  I've seen a student literally misspell her own first name in the essay.  I've seen essays that scream that English is not your first language so loudly they are hard to get through.  You don't want any of those.  Review your essays, revise them, and get someone else to help give you feedback too.

**7.  Don't make your essays low effort or last minute rush jobs.**  Too many bright students are used to churning out an essay in a couple hours and getting an A almost by default.  Or they're used to putting things off until the last minute but succeeding anyway because they're very bright.  Or maybe they're shotgunning too many schools and are already sick of it.  Or maybe they don't actually want to go to that particular school so they don't really try.  Whatever the reason, this is a recipe for disaster on college application essays because they are supposed to be much more than the typical writing you produce.  They should be thoughtful, introspective, expressive, creative, inspiring, interesting, and revealing.  You won't get that kind of compelling writing in a single draft or with a lazy approach.  Usually, when an essay was thrown together with little effort or very quickly, it shows.  That always communicates that you either don't care enough to give it the time and effort it deserves, or that you aren't capable of better.  Either way it's a fast one-way ticket to the waitlist.

**8.  Don't try to write about your entire life from a 30,000 foot view.**  You simply don't have space to say everything about yourself, so don't try.  Pick a few attributes and try to tell one story that showcases those.  If you bite off more than you can chew, you probably won't end up saying anything really compelling about yourself.  The more you zoom out, the more every student looks the same.  It's only when you talk to them, get to know them, spend time with them, learn about them, and engage them that you start to see how different, vibrant, interesting, talented, and incredible they are.  So give the AO an opportunity to get close to you in the essay.  Go small.  Zoom in on one story, not your whole life.  Don't use an introduction, just jump right in and let the story fill in the details as you go.

**9.  Don't use pithy aphorisms, clichés, or generalities even if ~~you made them up~~ they're original to you.**  Don't try to include wholesome sounding life lessons or broad sweeping statements about the world or humanity.  None of these:  "I learned more from them than they did from me."  "By striving to achieve greatness we can become more than we ever thought possible."  "Only by helping others can a person truly realize their potential in the world."  "I am far stronger than I knew and I'm excited to face the next set of challenges."  Those are all the worst and are an instant eye-roll and "not this again" sigh.

**10.  Don't fail to complete a portion of the application.**  On multiple occasions I have been reviewing an app and the next section loads and it's empty.  I refresh the page and still get nothing.  I reach out to the admins to make sure there's not a clerical or systems error.  Then I ask them to check the student record and if possible follow up with the student to make sure they completed the section.  Sometimes we get a response with the missing section and sometimes we don't.  It's never turned out well.  Many schools would not be this gracious and would simply move on to the next app.  If you're paying the app fee, get your money's worth by actually filling out the whole thing.

**11.  Don't be so academic and stick so close to the prompt.**  Some prompts are easier to fall into this mistake than others, but so often students are conditioned to answer the questions directly and fully like they would for school.  The prompt is primarily there to get you to talk about yourself.  So if it asks why you want to go to X school, don't write 500 words praising the school for being so awesome.  They already know how awesome they are.  What they want to know about is YOU and how YOU fit the school.  Make sure your response addresses the prompt and that it's clearly written for that school, but don't treat it like an exam question.  Think of it more like someone asked you that question on a date to find out more about you.  

**12.  Don't steal an essay that isn't yours.**  Sometimes this works and you take credit for a well-written and proven essay.  But there is also the risk that you could get caught and there is no statute of limitations on this.  If they discover it 25 years after you graduate, they can still cancel your degree.  It's just not worth the risk.  Not only is it riskier than most students realize, it's also not as effective.  What was a powerful and compelling picture of one student might not work or fit for you.  Holistic review means that everything is considered together in evaluating applications.  When things don't fit, it raises a variety of concerns and the total picture of the applicant just isn't as strong.

**13.  Avoid overused words, especially SAT words - plethora, myriad, ameliorate, etc.**  These don't make you sound smart.  They make you sound fake and basic.  Use words that you would use to talk about yourself to a friend or on a date or in a job interview.  

**14.  Don't use a template from a book, or model your essay after someone else's.**  One of the admissions officers that contributed to The New Rules of College Admissions tells the story of how one year she and her colleagues read several dozen essays that all talked about a genie granting wishes and how the wishes embodied the student and his/her ambitions for college and life.  They scratched their heads over the striking similarities until one of them found a book published that year that had a successful essay example that was the genie essay.  This didn't end well for those students. 

**15.  Don't go over the word limit.** AO's have to read a ton of essays and if yours is demonstrably longer, it's going to be annoying at best and detrimental to your rating at worst.  Many application review systems will automatically truncate responses at the word limit, so the end may not even show up.  

**16.  At the same time, don't write an essay that is less than about 60% of the word limit.**  Unless you have a really clever, amazing, and heretofore unseen idea that requires this, you should aim for 80-100% of the word limit.  If you're less than 60%, it just looks lazy, uninspired, aloof, and disengaged.  

**17.  Avoid giving off bad vibes.**  This includes excessive bragging, self-absorption, entitlement, snootiness, arrogance, bravado, presenting an abrasive personality, or anything else that indicates you will struggle to fit in to a vibrant community and flourishing student body.  Most of the major problems colleges deal with are related to a very small minority of their students.  So it saves a lot of big headaches to screen these people out in the admissions process.  Make sure your essay says "plays well with others" and not "social pariah bound for arrest or expulsion."  You want to come across as interesting, likeable, fun, clever, creative, and upbeat.  Let your SAT and grades showcase how smart you are.

**18.  Avoid pitymongering**, humblebragging, being a victim, depressed rants, passive aggressive or reverse psychology attempts  (e.g. "I just know I'm going to be rejected"), self-deprecation that goes too far, or generally an overly negative attitude.  This should be a showcase of your strengths, the very best you on your very best day.  Avoid putting others down, diving deep into personal conflicts (one essay I read was about a student's best friend abandoning her and how she cut her out of her life), showing inability to work with others and airs of superiority, paranoid defensiveness, or general toxicity.

**19.  Don't go overboard with BS or exaggeration.**  AOs are pretty familiar with common accomplishments and what typical high achieving students look like, so don't try too hard to stretch things.  They're also pretty familiar with BS because so many students try to pass it off as legitimate in their applications.  

**20.  Don't use the essay to explain the reason you don't have a 4.0**.  Don't make excuses, blame others or society for your shortcomings/struggles, gripe about injustices in your life, etc.  The essay is a space for you to showcase your personality, skills, abilities, accomplishments, talents, strengths, and potential.   

**21.  Make sure every essay you write says something meaningful about YOU**.  So many well-written essays end up being less impactful because they fail to say anything about the student.  If you tell a story, make sure it shows something compelling and insightful about you.

**22.  Don't simply rehash all the other stuff in your application.**  Essays take a lot of time to review, and AOs do not appreciate redundancy.  If you do write about something already listed in your application, make sure it adds more information and shows more of your personality, character, ability, etc.

**23.  Don't discuss or complain about your mental illnesses or other limitations.**  If you want to address extenuating circumstances, you can do so in the additional information section or have one of your recommenders explain it on your behalf.  Note that even here you want the focus to be on how you've overcome challenges, grown through them, and what you've learned in the process.  The essay shouldn't be wasted just trying to get you back to par with "normal" applicants, instead it should show how you are unique, awesome, and desirable as you are.  

**24.  Don't try too hard**.  This includes overdone attempts to impress, to be unique, to write well, to sound smart, to be funny, to make light of something serious, etc.  It's a little hard to define exactly what constitutes trying too hard, but AOs know it when they see it.  When you aren't yourself and it's not your voice, it's always going to be a worse essay.  "Go home and write a page tonight and let that page come out of you.  Then it will be true."  - Langston Hughes.  I'm taking that quote out of context, but if you go read Theme For English B, you'll see exactly what I mean.

**25.  Don't recycle an essay that was clearly written for something else.**  This includes submitting an essay that was done for a class in school, making bad and obvious copy/paste errors, or shoehorning a different application essay in.  All of these result in an essay that just doesn't feel right.

**26.  Don't get cute with fonts, presentation, etc.**  This means no secret codes, wingdings, mirror writing, weird poetry, Elvish, Klingon, Morse code, or arranging the words to form a pattern or picture.  I have seen or heard of all of these and they never go well.  Write the essay in English unless it's an international or multilingual school in which case you should write in the language you would be using there.  Don't try to impress AOs with how well you know French.  AO's don't have time or patience for that – they'll just skip over it and move on.

**27.  Don't write illegibly or incoherently**.  Use proper grammar, syntax, and diction – but remember to use your own voice.  Do not cite sources or do anything too academic.  This is an essay about you, not a documented research paper.  But it still needs to be easy to read.  An AO with hundreds of essays to read will appreciate it.

**28.  Don't regurgitate the prompt in your introduction.**  I know your English teacher probably taught you to do this in a 5 paragraph theme paper, but this is a different thing entirely.  Keep your essay unique and interesting.  Don’t be bland, predictable, or too straightforward.  Don't answer the prompt like you would on a test in school.  Instead, tell a story about your life.

**29.  Don't put down or belittle the college.**  Some students do this because it's not their first choice, they legitimately feel like insulting the institution, they want to intimate that the college is somehow "beneath them", or someone is making them apply.  Whatever the reason, it will only make you look petty, negative, and self-absorbed.  If you give off the sentiment that you don’t want to attend that college, the AO will probably oblige you.

**30.  Don't tell a story or write an essay that doesn't have a point.**  Some essays seem aimless and just ramble until the word limit is fulfilled.  I think many students are used to doing this in school to BS their way through an essay assignment of a given length.  Others don’t know what they want to say in the first place and end up saying nothing.  Remember that the focus of the essay (regardless of the prompt) is to reveal yourself to the AO.  Get them to like you, be curious about you, and leave with a positive impression of you.
