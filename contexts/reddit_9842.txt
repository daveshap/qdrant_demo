Undergraduate students & practitioners: What is your campus doing to mitigate student suicide risks and what do the students think about it?
Hello all. I am a graduate student in a Masters program and my class is talking about the rise in mental health concerns across the nation. I am wondering if any students, student affairs professionals, or researchers have any idea of effective risk mitigation strategies for reducing suicides within higher education. Any successful initiatives on campus? Programs? Strategies? Thanks for caring!
