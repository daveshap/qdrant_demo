New Job That Looked Like Heaven Is Starting To Feel Like Hell
I joined a company just as our country (South Africa) was going into lockdown. I was very excited coming from a small company to a big international company. I even got a laptop to work from home (old company only had desktop PCs). 

My manager told me that I was to do work that didn't require using their specific system (ie just use Excel , Word etc) for now then when we're all back at work I'd get training on the system.

Fast forward to this week and one of the people I report to sends me work that's got a deadline for next week and it requires knowledge of their system. My other supervisor assigned someone to "show me the ropes" literally yesterday and I feel it wasn't anywhere near being adequate.

I feel overwhelmed and any advice would be greatly appreciated
