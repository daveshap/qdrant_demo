Do you ever stay up late even when you’re exhausted to avoid facing the next day? Venting
It’s been a stressful week. 
I just found out I owe more than I thought to the IRS which means I can’t afford to leave my toxic living situation, I can’t afford to see my sick father for the holidays because my new job won’t allow me to have vacation time as a seasonal employee. I have 3 different major assignments coming up that are nowhere near finished. Sometimes I wish I could hit the pause button on life to catch my breath and sort my thoughts. Staying up late is as close as it gets. The rest of the world is asleep and I can think in peace. As soon as I go to sleep, I’ll wake up and it will be time to move through the motions again and scramble to pull myself together. Yes, this is a rant but the question is not rhetorical. Feel free to respond if you relate. This is my first post here (hi)

Edit: I didn’t expect this much support! Thank you! Update: I got one of my assignments done and finished the paperwork for my new job today and I’m feeling good about it! I’ve been brainstorming ways to make my current living situation more bearable, and am aiming to visit my dad over spring break in March. I’m doing my best to stay positive and not dwell on too many negative “what ifs” in regards to his condition. Just trying to focus on one or 2 things at a time to avoid getting overwhelmed or spiraling out. I really do appreciate all of your kind words!
