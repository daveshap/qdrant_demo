Advice about piercings and jobs
Hi guys, so I have never had a job I’m 22 and currently have been on disability for about a little over a year. I’ve been applying to jobs, (without any luck) but I’ve been extremely picky just for the simple fact that I have three visible piercings on my face and they aren’t subtle (bridge, septum, vertical labret). It’s extremely hard to find a job that I know wouldn’t care about them and my fear is having to be rid of them for this weird ideal that its apart of me and my appearance so to work a job that I’ll probably hate and make minimum for it’s risky to me. I’ve been trying to get around this and jump into work from home jobs but that isn’t exactly easy either.

So I guess I have three questions:

1. Is there anyway to get around them, or should I suck it up and just take them out?

2. What’s the secure way to at least land a interview 

3. Is it worth it to get into freelance or work from home jobs?
