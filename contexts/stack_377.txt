Use the HomePod to turn on TV and Receiver is there any way to have the Apple HomePod control my receiver? Here is what I am thinking:I would ask the Siri HomePod to play a playlist and Siri would automatically turn on my receiver (Sony STR-DN 1080) and my TV (a Sony Bravia from 2009 that has CEC). The HomePod Apple TV HDMI is hooked up to my receiver Video 2 port and the TV is hooked up to my receiver\u2019s ARC HDMI port. I do have my Apple TV set to play through my receiver.I\u2019m hoping I can avoid using remotes altogether to listen to music playlists. Is this possible? If so, what do I need to do to ge it to work?
