Most important character trait in a partner: The capacity for self reflection
Honestly, out of all the things that terrify me, a partner who lacks the capacity and/or willingness to self reflect has to be at the tippy top. And people don't discuss it enough!

 If you don't know why you do shitty things... you're just going to keep doing them... But thatâ€™s only one part of the equation. 

if you're not brave enough to move away from you're current identity, to move into the unknown, to take steps towards self repair, you're going to remain in a "woe is me" complex forever. Being upset with your actions is not enough. Self pity is not enough... (Adlerian psychological theory covers this extensively) 

Say you cheated in a previous relationship, my biggest question would be, what did you take away from that? What did you learn about yourself. If you cheated due to low self esteem and a need for outside validation.... and you don't consciously know that... you're 100% going to be doing that shit again because you're flying with blinders on...

 You need to realize that your reactions to what's in front of you are often reactions to dredged up feelings from the past that are being resized to appear congruent to the present.

If you can't accept that you're wrong in certain situations. If you can't confront parts of yourself that are uncomfortable...parts that may be at odds with the idealistic image of yourself, if you're not open to the possibility of having your ego demolished and rebuilt, you're a hopeless cause. Stay single till you figure your shit out.
