LEON: Foolish? If this dress were to walk down the boulevard all by itself I would follow it from one end of Paris to the other, and when I caught up with it I would say, Just a moment
LEON: You remember this room?
NINOTCHKA: I've never been here before. I wonder whom you're thinking of. Oh, I know, a girl with a map, figuring out each step, worrying about north and south. Today... now this might shock you... I went up to a taxi and said Eight Rue du Bois"... and here I am."
LEON: You see? Life can be so simple.
NINOTCHKA: For twelve francs, seventy-five.
LEON: Twelve seventy-five from the Clarence? The son-of-a-gun made a detour!... But he got you here.
NINOTCHKA: It's nine o'clock.
LEON: That's when one half of Paris says to the other half, What are your plans for this evening
NINOTCHKA: Well, first I should like to take off my hat and jacket. Then could we have some music?
LEON: A wonderful idea! Radio or records?
NINOTCHKA: Not radio. Let's have music that's just for ourselves.
