BONASERA: Yes, I understand. I'm listening.
HAGEN: You owe the Don a service. In one hour, not before, perhaps later, he will be at your funeral parlor to ask for your help. Be there to greet him. If you have any objections speak now, and I'll inform him.
BONASERA: Anything...Anything the Godfather wishes.
HAGEN: Good. He never doubted you.
BONASERA: The Don himself is coming to me tonight?
HAGEN: Yes.
