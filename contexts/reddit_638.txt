Am I weirdo for constantly looking at my crush
Hey I have a class with my crush. He’s so hot in my eyes so it’s really hard not to look. Every day I glance at him like every other  min in the class. He recently got a gf so oof. But i just want to know if a girl you don’t talk to glances at you all the time when you clearly notice is it considered weird or creepy. If so I’ll force myself to stop. It’s just that sometimes hell glance at me or we’ll make eye contact
