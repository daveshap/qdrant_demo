My journey out of poverty
My husband and I married out of high school and had a baby at 20. We made some poor choices and both dropped out of school.  



We were barely able to make ends meet, working minimum wage part time jobs. 



I applied for SNAP, WIC, and Medicaid. We worked opposite shifts (I took days, he worked nights) so we wouldnâ€™t need daycare. And we survived the first year. When my son was a year old, I filled out FAFSA and got a PELL grant with additional exceptional need assistance. I quit my job and went to nursing school. When I graduated, my husband went to technical school. 



We are now financially comfortable and able to support our family and pay back into the system. We made it out of poverty by using the social safety net. That was our one saving grace. 



There is no shame in using these social safety net programs.
