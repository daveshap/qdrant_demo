JACOB: Get me out of here.
DOCTOR"": Where do you want to go?
JACOB: Take me home.
DOCTOR"": Home? This is your home. You're dead.
JACOB: Dead? No. I just hurt my back. I'm not dead.
DOCTOR"": What are you then?
JACOB: I'm alive.
DOCTOR"": Then what are you doing here?
JACOB: I don't know. I don't know. This isn't happening.
DOCTOR"": What isn't happening?
JACOB: Let me out of here!
DOCTOR"": There is no out of here. You've been killed. Don't you remember?
DOCTOR"": Remember?
JACOB: No! That was years ago! I've lived years since then.
DOCTOR"": It's all been a dream.
JACOB: No! The army did this to me! They've done something to my brain. Jezzie! I want my boys! Sarah! I'm not dead! I want my family!
