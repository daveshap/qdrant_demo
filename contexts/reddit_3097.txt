What jobs could you guys recommend that actually do something good for people?
I've wanted to be a detective for a while now and met with a Sheriff recently to find out that most cases no matter the amount of evidence people still get away with it or continue doing it. I've seen these things first hand in media as well and from people I know. I don't know if anyone can either tell me if there's maybe more, if I'll actually being doing anything or should I find something else? I want to wake up every morning and know I'm doing right by this world but I'm starting to lose hope, yes I know I'm young and ignorant. My therapist told me to become an insurance inspector because I'll be solving cases like a detective and I'm maybe thinking about that because I really like that side of what being a cop would be, but I don't know how happy I'd be because I'm not directly helping others all that much. I'm also thinking maybe just find a job that fucks off from the world and makes decent money nothing bad, yet not really doing anything inherently good directly I guess because I don't want to die yet I feel like this world is nothing but scams and bullshit and the idea of really helping is something we can never accomplish. Also I have a GED and live in Georgia (can't move) so I have to put that into consideration.  Sorry if this is a lot I'm very lost if you can't tell lol.
