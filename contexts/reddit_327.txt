Right vs wrong?
I am in a situation where I don’t know what’s right or wrong or if I’m a bad person or not. In fact I can’t ever be sure who I am. I am always unsure. I fight back and fourth with my mom and we don’t get along. I try my hardest to avoid my mother and to avoid the weird things she does that triggers me. It doesn’t seem to help and somehow we end up fighting again. She yells at me some things that are really nuts and I know not to listen to those things but she says stuff about what I did wrong as well. I don’t know if what she’s describing it as is true or not. Even when the fight was started by her, she’d say “it gets us even for any of the times you started a fight”, etc.  or when I angrily told her to stop yelling about being stuck in the parking lot, she hollered that I fussed at her and made her too nervous to be able to cope with the situation. One time we were at my grandmas house. She had possessions she wanted to do some kind of weird work on there. I told her I wanted to go back home and didn’t say it mean either.... she yelled and said I was only thinking of myself and that I ruined her life. She said she wasn’t going to get this done because of me now. She apologized for that later on, and said she was wrong to yell at me and that I have to learn to consider others. She also said I usually get annoyed and start to tell her to stop doing something annoying out of anger. 

 She does really unstable things sometimes but I can’t tell what I am in the situation anymore .... I’m confused
