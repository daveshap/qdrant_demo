CREASY: Cut the stock here. The barrel here. Make sure you file it smooth. Rocket launchers?
RAYBURN: Different door. Not far from here.
CREASY: Maybe I can help your situation and you mine.
ROSANNA: So where do we begin?
CREASY: I need the name and address of the owner of a Toyota Corolla, license number ME31704... We didn't get the last digit so I need the ten possible matches.
ROSANNA: So what do I get in return?
CREASY: Let's see how the relationship develops. I'll call you in the AM. Thanks.
MANZANO: [He'll die of his wounds; bleed to death before he can do anything.]
ROSANNA: [He sounded strong to me. Stronger than we are.]
ROSANNA: [Because he's outside. Because he's not tied to the same system we are.]
MANZANO: [We did voice analysis of the last five high profile kidnappings, including the little girl. The same man 'The Dreamer'. Listen to this.]
