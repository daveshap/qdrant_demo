Who is skipping Christmas decorations because you're poor?
I am depressed this year, life circumstances aren't helping much, and I feel like I should decorate because that's what moms do, but my heart simply isn't in it. 

Anyone else not in the mood for the holidays and feel you can't afford decorations anyway?
