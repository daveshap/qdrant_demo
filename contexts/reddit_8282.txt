Have US presidents in the past have similar public animosity (as Trump has with judge James Robart) towards judges who ruled against them?
Off the top of my head i can remember  [Andrew Jackson ignoring the Supreme Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worcester_v._Georgia) and [Obama being ruled against by the Supreme Court](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Texas), but i am not aware of them using the kind of rhetoric used by President Trump ["The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!"](https://mobile.twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/827867311054974976) , ["Just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad!"](https://mobile.twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/828342202174668800).
