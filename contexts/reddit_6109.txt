Is Covid-19 pandemic affecting the length of prehire screenings or am I being impatient/paranoid?
Hi all,

Background: I received and accepted a written job offer on Monday.  Soon thereafter instructions for drug screening and consent forms for a background check were sent to my inbox through an automated HR system.  The HR rep never gave me a timeline on how long this step would take and she also hasn't given me an expected start date.  I completed the drug test on Monday and I'm still waiting to hear back if everything checked out OK.  The testing center said 1-2 business days and therein lies my concern.

My questions to the sub: Is anyone else experiencing delays in background checks or is a week fairly normal?  The drug screening was done through Lab Corp and several friends have suggested they're likely inundated with coronavirus tests, which I can believe.  My other question is when is it appropriate to follow-up with HR if I haven't heard anything to make sure all my ducks are in a row?  My thought would be this Friday afternoon or Monday, but I also don't want to come across as impatient.  Thanks in advance!
