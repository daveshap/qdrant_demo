Handling small on-campus apartment with a partner + pet
Hi All, I'm a residential director at a small private school. I have a partner and a dog whom I live with in our on campus apartment. But things are getting tough. Our apartment is a very small one bedroom and it's getting to be really frustrating to come home from work sometimes after 10-12 hours to a space I don't and can't event enjoy. We painted, added cupboards, shelves, pictures/decor, etc, but it just... sucks. 
Recently, I requested to move apartments to an apartment in another building. My request was denied, as it is further from campus and will have fewer than 150 students in it. I understand the reasoning, but I oversee that building and am honestly pissed that a few graduate assistants are going to be living in a 2 bedroom 3 bath apartment when I'm stuck. 

How have my fellow reslifers gotten through this?
