Password manager and account recovery I'd like to start using a password manager, but I'm not sure how to handle account recovery.I'm not a criminal or a secret agent, so if I lose my master password (or my second authentication factor, like a Yubikey thumbdrive, or my own thumb), I don't want my data to be unrecoverable (and by \"my data\" , I mean \"my access right to all my accounts for which I used my password manager to store potentially automatically generated and forgettable passwords\": I can afford to lose access to my password manager, if I can reset it, and regain access to all my accounts separately with each of their account recovery options).Let's assume I don't use the password manager's vault recovery, because they all seam unsafe or unpractical, when they are available. The only way to be able to recover any account in any situation (phone, computer and password-list-on-a-piece-of-paper lost or taken by someone else, for example) is by using account recovery from an email address, since it only requires an internet access and a password, but it just moves the problem elsewhere. For example, I could use an unique recovery email address for all accounts from a security-oriented provider like ProtonMail, and use it only for account recovery to make it less visible to potential attackers. But it's still another password to remember (with the master password) and another entry point, and if I use the password manager to store this new password but lose the master password, the recovery address becomes useless. The only solution I can think about is by using a trusted person (like my wife) to store on their password manager my recovery address password and to never change it (unless their master password is compromised for example), and I could do the same for theirs. That way, it's unlikely that we both lose access to our respective password managers. So my question is: Which strategy is the best concerning password manager and account recovery?Are password managers vault recovery more secure than my propositions? Are there better alternatives?P.S. : When I say \"password manager's vault recovery\I mean \"password manager's means to recover my vault or my master password\and when I say \"account recovery\I mean \"account provider's means to recover my account or my password which I stored in my password manager\for example, Facebook specific account recovery means.
