JACK: Hello?
TYLER'S VOICE: Who's this?
JACK: Tyler?
TYLER'S VOICE: Who's this?
JACK: Uh... I'm sorry. We met on the plane. We had the same briefcase. I'm... you know, the clever guy.
TYLER'S VOICE: Oh, yeah.
JACK: I just called a second ago. There was no answer. I'm at a payphone.
TYLER'S VOICE: I star-sixty-nined you. I never pick up my phone. What's up?
JACK: Well... let me see... here's the thing...
JACK: You buy furniture. You tell yourself: this is the last sofa I'll ever need. No matter what else happens, I've got the sofa issue handled. Then, the right set of dishes. The right dinette.
TYLER: This is how we fill up our lives.
JACK: I guess so.
TYLER: And, now it's gone.
JACK: All gone.
TYLER: Could be worse. A woman could cut off your penis while you're asleep and toss it out the window of a moving car.
JACK: There's always that.
TYLER: I don't know, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe it's a terrible tragedy.
JACK: ...no ...no ...
TYLER: I mean, you did lose a lot of nice, neat little shit. The trendy paper lamps, the Euro-trash shelving unit, am I right?
TYLER: But maybe, just maybe, you've been delivered.
JACK: Delivered from Swedish furniture.
TYLER: Delivered from armchairs in obscure green stripe patterns.
JACK: Delivered from Martha Stewart.
TYLER: Delivered from bullshit colors like Cobalt
JACK: Insurance'll cover it.
TYLER: Oh, yeah, you gotta start making the list.
JACK: What list?
TYLER: The now I get to go out and buy the exact same stuff all over again" list. That list."
JACK: I don't... think so.
TYLER: This time maybe get a widescreen TV. You'll be occupied for weeks.
JACK: Well, I have to file a claim...
TYLER: The things you own, they end up owning you.
JACK: Don't I?
TYLER: Do what you like.
JACK: God, it's late. I should find a hotel...
TYLER: A hotel?
JACK: Yeah.
TYLER: So, you called me up, because you just wanted to have a drink before you... go find a hotel?
JACK: I don't follow...
TYLER: We're on our third pitcher of beer. Just ask me.
JACK: Huh?
TYLER: You called me so you could have a place to stay.
JACK: No, I...
TYLER: Why don't you cut the shit and ask if you can stay at my place?
JACK: Would that be a problem?
TYLER: Is it a problem for you to ask?
JACK: Can I stay at your place?
TYLER: Yes, you can.
JACK: Thank you.
TYLER: You're welcome. But, I want you to do me one favor.
JACK: What's that?
TYLER: I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
JACK: What?
TYLER: I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
