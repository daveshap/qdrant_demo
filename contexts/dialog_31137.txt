KELLY: Excuse me?
RAY: You all gonna go down to the Caribbean together?
RAY: The thing about it is, threesomes so rarely work out.
KELLY: You're out of your mind.
RAY: I've been a cop for a while, Kelly. It's hard enough for one person to keep a secret, let alone three. And then there's the love angle. I mean do you and Sam really want that little pill-head around, now that you have the money?
RAY: Am I right, did Sam sell you on the idea right up front, of whacking Suzie? That's murder, Kelly.
KELLY: Police -- God -- get a life.
