DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK: I know you.
MEMPHIS: You know my back.
DETECTIVE DRYCOFF: When'd you get to town, Raines?
MEMPHIS: The other day....
DETECTIVE DRYCOFF: What for?
MEMPHIS: No particular reason. Catch a Laker game. I heard we got Shaquille ...
DETECTIVE DRYCOFF: Where you been, anyway?
MEMPHIS: Just out there. Roaming around. Building up my collection of refrigerator magnets ...
DETECTIVE DRYCOFF: You seem a little hinked-up ...
MEMPHIS: Not at all ...
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK: I remember us having made some kind of deal, Randall. I don't remember this deal having some kind of time-limit. I look at you - here - in my town - and I'm confused...
MEMPHIS: A little family emergency --
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK: I hope it's not your dear sweet mother...
MEMPHIS: No...
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK: Or your baby brother. What was his name?
MEMPHIS: Kip.
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK: Yes, Kip. Short for Kipling. Named for the English writer of stories about India ... He bites into his pear ... Memphis says nothing, waits ...
MEMPHIS: And this has what to do with me?
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK: I don't know. But you shouldn't be here. Take care of your business. I'll give you 24 hours. And then I don't want to see your face. Ever again. Make a fool of me once, that's my bad. Make a fool of me twice. That's really my bad, and I'll kick your ass from here to India ...
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK: Good. Cos you know how it plays. Six years ago, I let you go free. But the next time ... The next time sends you away for'a long, long while ...
DETECTIVE DRYCOFF: By the time you get out, asshole, there won't even be cars. We'll all be cruisin' around in space ships ...
TOBY: You goin' home?
KIP: Yeah... You want a ride...
TOBY: Sure -
KIP: How'd you get here? Your Moms give you ride -- ?
TOBY: Hell, no. I boosted a 'Vette.
KIP: You boosted a 'Vette? Then where is it?
TOBY: I dunno. It was right here. Someone musta' boosted it back...
KIP: Damn crooks is everywhere --
