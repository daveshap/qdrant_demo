Just out of curiosity I created a fake women profile on tinder to see what would happen and here were the results. Do you women agree?
First off I would say the majority of the guys, about 80% of them were absolutely terrible dudes. What I mean by terrible is most of these guys seem like they never seen a barbershop or shower in years! So just having pictures of yourself cleaned up and groomed will at the very least put you ahead of a lot of guys!! Another thing that stood out was that I seen a lot of bio’s that were basically begging women to match with them, basically crying out for a match. You have a better shot of not having a bio at all. I was really disgusted at my fellow brothers, your average male profile is down right pitiful. Most of these guys really need to get it together, it’s so obvious why most guys get zero matches, let alone an actual date. Women would you agree with what I saw? I can see why women get entertainment from it, most of the profiles had me laughing in tears.
