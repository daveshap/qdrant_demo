When i quote you from him you do not listen but when i quote you from Einstein you listen Feeling great to join this network. I appreciate it. I have a question:  is it better to use the word quote or cite in such situation talking with a hypocrite person?<blockquote>  \"When I quote you from him you do not listen but when I quote you from  Einstein you listen.\"</blockquote>or<blockquote>  \"When I cite you from him you do not listen but when I cite you from  Einstein you listen.\"</blockquote>I want the more natural sounding, as English isn't my first language. I saw cite word is also used instead of quote word as synonym.Thank you. :)
