Todays job interview ruined my entire day and I feel so burnt out
I had a phone interview today with a recruiter and she was late and never apologized or explained why she was late. After finishing all the questions, she quickly told me that I wasn't a good fit for this position as if she already made her decision before the interview. If so, why call me??! im so confused. im sad not cause i didn't get the job but because i was treated so poorly. people tell me that the industry is always like this and I have to understand how this works if i want to survive but that NEVER gives an excuse for people to behave this way.

its been almost 3 years of unemployment, hundreds of failed interviews and i just feel so tired guys. i don't know what to do anymore.

EDIT: oh wow i really didn't think i would get this many comments. thank you to everyone who has said kind words! and for those of who are asking: I just quit my part-time job so that I could focus a bit more on job hunting sorry i should've clarified that! to everyone that is in the same boat, good luck to all of us! you got this!
