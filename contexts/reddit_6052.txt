Which industries do you think will grow & thrive post COVID-19?
I'm a grad student in the humanities and coronavirus will probably shut down a lot of schools & kill the academic job market (which was already dying). But I'm curious to know what y'all think about the future jobs that will be affected (in particular, positively) by COVID-19.

We all know things like Zoom and video conferencing will be around for a while. Obviously, the medical industry is always a safe bet, too.

But what other industries do you think will grow once the coronavirus dust settles?
