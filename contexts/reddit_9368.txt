How do I talk to people who have never been poor?
Not sure if this belongs in this subreddit, if not feel free to let me know!

About 6 months ago I finally got a salaried job. After more than a year of struggling after graduation I finally made it!

The job has been great, but I've found that most of my coworkers seem solidly middle class if not higher, and I feel like the odd man out sometimes. I don't know how to talk to them when they talk about visiting vineyards and going skiing and traveling around the world when my family could barely scrape by all my life. 

I want to get along with my coworkers because I see myself at this company for a long time. How do I learn to relate to these people without outright lying about my past?

Tl;dr My coworkers are rich and middle class and idk how to get along with them as a poor person.
