ANNE: Stewart! We're all waiting for you. Where's your valet?
STEW: I poisoned him.
ANNE: Stop trying to be funny, and get ready, will you?
STEW: I'm not going!
ANNE: What are you talking about?
STEW: I'm talking about - I'm not going out.
ANNE: What am I going downstairs and tell those people?
STEW: Go downstairs, and tell them - anything. Tell them I'm not going. Tell them I'm not home.
ANNE: Stewart, would you mind telling me why you're not going?
STEW: Yes, I'll tell you - for the same reason I've never wanted to go out with those social parasites, those sweet-smelling fashion plates. I don't like them. They bore me. They give me the jitters.
