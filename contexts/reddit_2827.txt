Liberal arts degree, thought I lucked out working my way up to getting the “Product Manager” title. All I do is create powerpoints and simple reports in excel. Approaching 30, getting no call backs, under qualified for PM jobs. What are my options?
The PM position I have is at a hardware tech company in the Bay Area, that underpays about 50% under the market rate. I’m beginning to feel the burn financially. 

I’ve sent out applications. I’m clearly unqualified as a Product Manager, so I’ve tried for Program Management or Business Analyst, but not even so much as a phone screen. Given the wealth of talent in the area, I think my lack of basic tech skills or certifications are really hurting me.

Ideally, I’d want to start low and work my way back up to an actual PM position with a real foundation, but this seems like a pipe dream. 

I would love some advice or guidance on what to do.
