Does a Gold Axe mine faster than a Diamond Axe in Minecraft? I have been looking around on a lot of Minecraft websites, and I have seen that Gold tools, as crappy as they are, work faster than Diamond tools on some blocks. Does anyone know if this is actually true? I want to know because I want to make sure, because I am working on a future command on Bedrock Edition for a God Axe that chops faster than any other axe in the game, and also does significant damage to mobs and other players.
