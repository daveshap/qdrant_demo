RAMÓN: A fighter, huh?
ESPERANZA: He was born fighting. And born hungry.
RAMÓN: Drink, drink, Juanito. You'll never have it so good.
ESPERANZA: He'll have it good. Some day.
ESPERANZA: What were they saying? About you? In there?
RAMÓN: They say I am no good to you.
ESPERANZA: You are no good to me -- in jail.
RAMÓN: I'd lie on my cot in the cell and I couldn't sleep with the bugs and the stink and the heat. And I'd say to myself, think of something nice. Something beautiful. And then I'd think of you. And my heart would pound against the cot for love of you.
RAMÓN: Not just Juanito. You'll have it good too, Esperanza. We're going to win this strike.
ESPERANZA: What makes you so sure?
RAMÓN: Because if we lose, we lose more than a strike. We lose the union. And the men know this. And if we win, we win more than a few demands. We win... ... something bigger. Hope. Hope for our kids. Juanito can't grow strong on milk alone.
