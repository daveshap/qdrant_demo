Changing jobs just after starting (xpost /r/advice)
I just graduated with my Canadian bachelor's a few months ago and started at a company (Company A) 2 weeks ago. While I was interviewing with Company A, I was also interviewing with Company B, but because they have a longer interview process, I only got a job offer after being at Company A for a week and the job start date is September 1st. I have now accepted the position at Company B.

I took the job at Company A because I really, really needed the money and knew I wouldn't last until September. I am realizing that Company A is not one that I want to work for long-term and am now trying to decide on an exit strategy.
I have realized that I don't like the working conditions or management and the job is menial at best. (I have caught up in 2 weeks to staff that have been there for 6-8 weeks, and they have education levels of 2-year diplomas AT BEST.)
I suspect that I will get let go the moment I give notice and so I am tempted to give only 1 week of notice instead of 2.

Note: I have yet to officially accept Company A's letter of proposal and it was only provided to me after I had already started there. In contrast, Company B already sent me an official offer and will be sending me the employment contract this week for advance reading.

TL;DR Should I inform my boss at my 2 week old job in 2 weeks(1 week notice) or next week(2 week notice) if I strongly suspect I will get let go immediately.
