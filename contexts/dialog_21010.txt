NEBBLEMAN: They're here! They're here! We have the nanobot.
ARGON: Excellent. How long until the assembler tank is complete?
NEBBLEMAN: Dr. Makeo is working on it now, sir. I estimate at least another six hours.
ARGON: In the meantime, why don't you find something useful for Dr. Bright to do.
SUSAN: I swear to you, Argon, if you don't stop the meltdown that nanobot will be the last one I ever build.
ARGON: Susan, I sense you are having difficulty understanding the situation you are presently in. I ask that you keep in mind that I am ready to reduce an entire city to gelatin to get what I want.
