NEO: Hello?
MORPHEUS: Hello, Neo. Do you know who this is?
NEO: Morpheus...
MORPHEUS: I've been looking for you, Neo. I don't know if you're ready to see what I want to show you, but unfortunately, we have run out of time. They're coming for you, Neo. And I'm not sure what they're going to do.
NEO: Who's coming for me?
MORPHEUS: Stand up and see for yourself.
NEO: Right now?
MORPHEUS: Yes. Now.
