CLAIRE: That's not all, Frances. Mr. Bebe is very concerned about your politics. He hears you've been donating money, speaking at rallies.
FRANCES: Yup. Claire... please, please tell Mr. Bebe that if he worried half as much about his scripts as he does about my private life, we'd make a lot better movies.
CLAIRE: I'm sorry, Frances. It's my job, you know?
FRANCES: I know. 'This is a factory and we each have our jobs. The writer writes, the director directs, and the actress...'
CLAIRE: ...acts. I'll relay your message.
