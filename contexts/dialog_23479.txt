FENNYMAN: This time we take your boots off!
HENSLOWE: What have I done, Mr. Fennyman?
FENNYMAN: The theatres are all closed by the plague!
HENSLOWE: Oh, that.
FENNYMAN: by order of the Master of the Revels!
HENSLOWE: Mr. Fennyman, let me explain about the theatre business. The natural condition is one of insurmountable obstacles on the road to imminent disaster. Believe me, to be close by the plague is a bagatelle in the ups and downs of owning a theatre.
FENNYMAN: So what do we do?
HENSLOWE: Nothing. Strangely enough , it all turns out well.
FENNYMAN: How?
HENSLOWE: I don't know. It's a mystery.
