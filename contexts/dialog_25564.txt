BEN: You were right. It is my responsibility. The Force of Others brought the message to you and then it brought you to me.
LUKE: My father used to talk about the Force of Others. But he never told me what it was...
BEN: Let's just say the Force is something a Jedi Warrior deals with. It is an energy field in oneself, a power that controls ones acts, yet obeys ones commands. It is nothing, yet it makes marvels appear before your very eyes. All living things generate this Force field, even you.
LUKE: You mean I generate an energy field?
BEN: It surrounds you and radiates from you. A Jedi can feel it flowing from him... ... from here!
LUKE: Could I learn to feel it?
BEN: That is not a human decision, not your or mine.
LUKE: What do you mean?
BEN: It means you'd better get some rest. We'll be leaving for Mos Eisley first thing in the morning. The trip will be difficult and dangerous, but it's the only spaceport with ships large enough to get us to Organa Major. Now go on!
