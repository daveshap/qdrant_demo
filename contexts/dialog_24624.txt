CLAIRE: You told me I'm safe? I'm going for a walk in the park.
MIKE: Claire, will you calm down?
CLAIRE: I'm perfectly calm, I'm a normal human being. I'm going for a walk in the park.
MIKE: Claire...!
MIKE: Stop, will you?!
CLAIRE: Let go!
MIKE: Stop being nuts!
CLAIRE: I trusted you! I thought you cared about me?!
MIKE: I do care about you!
CLAIRE: More bullshit! More bullshit! What kind of odds are they giving me? There must be some kind of office pool. One month? A couple of days?
