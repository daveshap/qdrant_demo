Failure to reach my dreams on Japan.
All of my (IRL) friends knows that I am obsessed with Japan. I studied the language for 4 years; have learnt as much as I can about the history (mostly the Heian period onwards); am the go-to guy for answers my friends have about Japan; things like that.

* Straight out of University, I applied for the [JET](http://www.jetprogramme.org/) and was turned down.

* I went and got myself a job teaching, and after 2 years re-applied and got turned down.

* < A couple more attempts at different applications, organisations and scholarships in here >

* I applied for a scholarship to studying at a Japanese university in 2012, and got turned down.

* I applied for a different scholarship last year, and got turned down (I received the letter today).

There's a certain point where this becomes pathetic and I'm afraid that I've reached that point. I don't want to give up on my dream of living and working in Japan, but I'm sick and tired of putting my life on hold while I wait for the response from some scholarship or organisation or other.

Plus, there's only so much rejection that a person can take, ya know?

I don't want to let my dream die. I really want this, but I keep getting my ass handed to me, and the feeling of being a loser is being amplified more and more, each time.

I just feel like dreams and goals are things that others have, and that I'm supposed to wallow in mediocrity at this point.
