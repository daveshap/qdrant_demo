My mother just told me she's depressed
This morning, my mother finally told me why she hasn't been working in the past two months and half. She suffers from clinical depression, which causes her job as a medical doctor to be too overwhelming for her. I told her she should see a psychiatrist about that, and she responded that she is already seeing one and that she's taking meds to help her. She said she wanted to tell me because she knew I was really worried about her and why she hasn't been to work in the past months. Indeed, I was thinking that something was horribly wrong and she was dying or something like that. I am 18 years old and I dealt with depression last year. I didn't even realise that that was depression until my mom had me meet a psychiatrist who finally determined that I was depressed. Anyway, with proper medication, I overcame it and got much better, but I spent so many days and nights feeling extremely miserable. Thinking that my mother could be feeling that way breaks my heart. 
Unfortunately, that's not all she's dealing with. Her father died last week. My parents flew overseas to see him when his state was critical, but they refused that I come because I have school. Merely writing this, as his grandson, brings tears to my eyes. I've spent most of my days and nights since his death crying, but I cannot imagine how my mom feels. I haven't seen her cry, but it would be extremely typical of her to hide her woe if she thought that it would pain me to see her suffer.
I suspect she's at the lowest point of her life, having to deal with clinical depression and then the death of her father, but I don't know how to help her get through this, which is why I need advice.
