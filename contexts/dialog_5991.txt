MR. ROSE: You just go inside, Homer. We don't need no help.
ROSE ROSE: That's right, Homer. This ain't your business.
HOMER: Please listen to me! *Both* of you...
MR. ROSE: You forget yourself, Homer. This here's my daughter! You got your own mess to deal with--ain't that right?
MR. ROSE: What business is you in, Homer?
HOMER: Mr. Rose, I'm in the *doctor* business. If you want, I can help you. You don't have to go anywhere.
MR. ROSE: What's that? What's it called?
HOMER: One cervical stabilizer, two sets of dilators--Douglas points. One medium- sized curette, one small; one medium speculum, one large; two vulsellum forceps.
MR. ROSE: There ain't no *almost* about this stuff, Homer--ain't that right?
HOMER: Merthiolate, ether, vulval pads, gauze--lots of gauze.
MR. ROSE: When it comes to this, you is the real thing--is that what you sayin'?
