BEDSOE: She was a good woman.
MCCLEOD: You didn't bring me here to talk about her.
BEDSOE: No.
BEDSOE: I brought you here to talk about him. Do you know him?
MCCLEOD: No.
BEDSOE: You sure?
MCCLEOD: He doesn't look familiar -- but then he'd probably be easier to identity with his head.
BEDSOE: I'm in the middle of an interrogation, Captain.
CAPTAIN: Interrogation's over, Bedsoe.
BEDSOE: What?
CAPTAIN: Cut him loose. The D.A. says you ain't got shit on this guy.
BEDSOE: You don't understand. About seven years ago we found the body of a guy named Vasilnic in Jersey. A week later in the parking lot of Madison Square Garden we found Iman Fasil. Three days after that Luman Castageer was found in an alley. The fourth body we've never been able to identify. All four men died from decapitation. Nash was our primary suspect -- but he disappeared.
CAPTAIN: It's circumstantial.
BEDSOE: For Chrissake! Gimme a break. The guy disappears for seven years and as soon as he comes back it starts again.
CAPTAIN: I see your point, Bedsoe, but I have to look at this from the law's point of view. There's something missing here. It's something I'm sure you've come across many times in your career. It's called evidence. Get me a murder weapon with his fingerprints on it. Find me an eye witness. Dig up a motive. Until then we don't have a case against him.
