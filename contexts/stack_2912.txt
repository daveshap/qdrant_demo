What determines the direction of a photon emitted by an electron? When an electron loses energy and emits a photon, what determines the direction that this newly-created photon will travel?The electron, being a point entity, has no internal physical structure, so I'm assuming the photon's motion is inherited from the motion of the electron at the instant when the photon was emitted?
