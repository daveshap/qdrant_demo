Sponsorship visa to the UK My girlfriend is based in the UK, a single mom of two little girls, working class, has her place etc.We have been dating since April 2017. She visited Nigeria in October to see my family, with which she spent a week. So I plan to visit her family and formally introduce myself. She said she will be my sponsor and she would apply for the visa for me from the UK. We are both 33 years old. My account has 1,500 pounds after conversion. Please what steps do we need to take to ensure my application is successful? Plus I currently work for a well-known telecom company in Nigeria. What do we both need to get a successful application.
