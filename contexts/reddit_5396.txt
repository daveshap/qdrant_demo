I want to fire an employee, but cannot.
I want to fire this employee (call her "Mary") because:

* Failed our key benchmark for staff by a wide margin.
* Reckless behavior.  Has been responsible for 5 accidents and at least twice as many near-misses.
* Generally poor attitude.  Does less than the minimum amount of work and bad mouths the company routinely.
* Minimal skills and unwillingness/inability to advance.  Hired for an entry level position and never advanced in 7 years.
* For the reasons above, and others reasons I have not mentioned here, I am certain Mary is not going to ever improve.

Additionally, I am certain she has been building a case for work comp and/or disability or some form of harassment, even though somehow she has avoided serious injury (in spite of her recklessness) and we have never been anything less than completely professional in dealing with her.

I have wanted to fire Mary for a very long time, but because I am only 1 of 3 managers that would need to sign off on this decision it has not happened.  The other two managers recognize Mary is an awful employee, yet they choose to not deal with it because Mary's personal situation is especially bad and they believe it would be cruel to let her go.  They are hoping she will retire "soon" and the problem will take care of itself.

Mary is single, 62 years old, cares for her severely disabled brother, lives close to the edge financially and, given the weak job market in our area, there is zero chance she will earn comparable pay or benefits without relocating 200+ miles.

I have been contemplating a strong-arm approach to the other two managers to force a decision, though I am contemplating if they might be more willing to accept a compromise (reduced hours?).

Any advice on how to deal with Mary?

\[EDIT\] Mary has a few notes on her performance issues in her personnel file (though there should be many more).
