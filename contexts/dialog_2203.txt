CARL: What is it?
REEF: Your 'out.' This came for you.
CARL: My father! He's not - ?
REEF: Dead? Matter of fact, he's much better. He's left the hospital.
CARL: What did you mean: I'm 'out?'
REEF: Your father can be in Nome, Alaska, tomorrow. We have two choices: Ask them to send him out in a 'copter', and take you off, or the Shark can put back into Nome...
CARL: You 'trade school boys' are all alike, aren't you? Anybody who doesn't happen to think like a little gold-braided puppet is, ipso facto, a coward!
REEF: <u>You</u> said it. But I won't argue -
CARL: Wearing a uniform doesn't bestow an automatic monopoly on courage, <u>Commander</u>! It just so happens I'm <u>not</u> a coward - physical or mental - and before I'd risk my father's life...
REEF: We're <u>all</u> risking our lives!
CARL: That may be. But Dad stays where <u>he</u> is, and I'm staying here!
REEF: You're really a mixed-up oddball, aren't you?
CARL: Perhaps. But the idea of willingly going to <u>school</u> to spend my <u>life</u> at a Paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunder-lizards - I'm referring to War - <u>that</u> strikes me as the <u>worst</u> cowardice of all - being spiritually yellow!
REEF: You mean <u>nothing</u> is worth fighting for?
CARL: Peace - the dignity of man - the destiny of the human spirit! Show me a man who says you win <u>those</u> by fighting wars, and <u>I'll</u> show you an idiot!
REEF: You may not <u>win</u> them. But without men like your father, to 'degrade' himself by fighting to preserve them - or as much as we have of them - they'd have disappeared, <u>long</u> ago!
