REGGIE: as outlined in report number three- nine-stroke-five-two of the Western Hemisphere Conference held on March 22 -- no wait! It was last Thursday, five o'clock at the Jardin des Champs- Élysées! Adam -- that was it! The garden!
ADAM: It's Thursday today -- and it's almost five -- come on!
REGGIE: Now what?
ADAM: Five o'clock -- Thursday -- the Garden -- it's got to be something around here.
REGGIE: But Charles' appointment was last week, not --
ADAM: I know, but this is all we've got left.
REGGIE: Well, you're right there. Ten minutes ago I had a job.
ADAM: Stop grousing. If we find the money I'll buy you an international conference all your own. Now start looking. You take this side and I'll poke around over there.
REGGIE: It's hopeless -- I don't even know what we're looking for.
ADAM: It's all right -- I don't think Tex does, either.
REGGIE: Tex? You mean he's here, too?
ADAM: Look.
