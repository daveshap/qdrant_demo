What is the word for \"interaction with business for understanding requirements and present back\" I'd like to put in CV a succint term as responsibility for \"interaction with business for understanding requirements and present back\". Business representative ? business interaction (seems not good enough) ? It would be in CV under the responsibility, telling my capacity of all steps in application/solution development : \"management, [missing here for business interaction], design, development, integration, test, maintenance\"
