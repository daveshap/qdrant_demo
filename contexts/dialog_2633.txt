DELACROIX: Manray!
SLOAN: Manray!
DELACROIX: How did you know?
SLOAN: It hit me like a ton of bricks.
DELACROIX: How can this be? You and me at the same time, the exact same thought. It's scary.
SLOAN: The idea was out there in the universe. Now what?
MANRAY: We ran out without my shoes and the floor. I gotta get my stuff. What about our savings?
CHEEBA: Are you crazy? The joint is crawling with cops now. You wanna go to Rikers? Go to the hoosegow?
DELACROIX: Manray was under our nose the whole time.
SLOAN: Do you know how you will use him?
DELACROIX: Not yet, but this thing will never get made.
SLOAN: You lost me.
DELACROIX: Dunwitty wants a Coon show. And that's what I'm going to give him, it's going to be so racist, so negative, he won't have the balls to put it on the air. Hence I'll prove my point.
SLOAN: What point is that?
DELACROIX: The point being that him, the networks don't want Black people on television unless they are buffoons.
SLOAN: Sounds risky to me.
DELACROIX: You getting cold feet?
SLOAN: I'm in till the end.
DELACROIX: Good. I'm going to need your support.
SLOAN: Can't you just quit? Walk away?
DELACROIX: And lose out on my money? The only way I get paid is if I get fired. And that's what I intend to do.
