Finally saved up $1,000 in the savings account. Pretty happy about that comma.
I've been bad with savings since as long as I can remember. And having a 4 month old doesn't help either but this is a positive start


Edit: gotta say I didn't think this would get as much attention as it did. Thanks guys/girls!

Edit 2: thanks for all the support! I feel like if I had posted this in other finance subs it would've gotten buried but you guys/girls understand because we're all living it! I'm really starting to love this sub.
