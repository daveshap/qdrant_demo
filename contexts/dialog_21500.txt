WESTLEY: True, but that's hardly common knowledge, is it? Thank you. Now, there may be problems once we're inside.
INIGO: I'll say -- how do I find the Count? -- Once I do, how do I find you again? -- Once I find you again, how do we escape? --
FEZZIK: Don't pester him, he's had a hard day.
INIGO: Right, right, sorry.
FEZZIK: Inigo.

FEZZIK: I hope we win...
HUMPERDINCK: You don't seem excited, my little muffin.
BUTTERCUP: Should I be?
HUMPERDINCK: Brides often are, I'm told.
BUTTERCUP: I do not marry tonight.
