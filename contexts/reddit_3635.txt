I managed to man the f up today. Man it feels good. Today was a good day and I’ll write this down on my journal
I was supposed to ask her out this recent Monday but I pussied out. So today I thought “should I wait for another week for this?” So I managed to man the f up today after class and asked her (classmate of mine)  

We were walking together, I paused walking, so she paused too. I looked at her straight in the eye and asked her if she wants to go grab some food (sushi place)  after class. She replied that she needs to go to a family member immediately after class. So I asked her when she’s free and she said maybe next week or week after that. So I said “oh okay, I’ll see you in class next week then” 

I took it as rejection, and that’s fine with me. It just feels so good that I managed to man the f up and now I feel like I just slayed a dragon. AND, atleast I get to be honest with myself and to her. So now I won’t be expecting much anymore. It was a good day because I finally became honest with my feelings to someone, and of course to myself too.
