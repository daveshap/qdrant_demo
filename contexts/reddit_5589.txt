Can I exaggerate on my resume?
All these "Entry" level jobs I find are *not* entry level. I want my career to be in photography, but all the requirements seem to be asking for one year of Photoshop at minimum and a photography degree. I have four years of photography and Lightroom experience, and a bit in Photoshop; would it be okay if I applied anyway? Like, my photography experience is basically on par with a degree, and while I don't use Photoshop, I know the basics and can manipulate images so it isn't noticeable. For an *entry* level position, you aren't really gonna be the main photographer/editor anyway.

Same goes for things like customer service or marketing. All these entry level jobs are asking for one year of experience, would it be okay to just apply? Some of the other jobs I'm looking at is stuff like social media manager and they just want you to post on IG, YouTube, Facebook etc. I'm a millennial, that's easy, I post on social media all the time. But would that count as marketing experience? Like I know what they're asking for (Post a photo to Instagram and say "Look at this product, buy it because of X Y and Z!" or upload a YouTube video of a product). 

I guess I'm just frustrated that I keep seeing jobs I know I'm qualified for but don't have the resume to back it up. I legit saw a job that wanted someone to post to Instagram photos of products and they were asking for someone with a Bachelors in marketing...
