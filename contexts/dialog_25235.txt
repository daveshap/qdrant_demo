KLINGON AMBASSADOR: Even as the Federation negotiated a peace treaty with us, Kirk was secretly developing the Genesis torpedo! Conceived by Kirk's son and test detonated by the Admiral himself! The result of this awesome energy was euphemistically called The Genesis Planet..." A secret base from which to launch the. annihilation of the Klingon people! We demand the extradition of Kirk! We demand justice!"
SAREK: Klingon justice is a unique point of view, Mr. President.
SAREK: Genesis was perfectly named: The creation of life not death. It was the Klingons who had first blood while trying to possess its secrets.
KLINGON AMBASSADOR: Vulcans are well known as the intellectual puppets of the Federation!
SAREK: Your vessel did destroy U.S.S. Grissom. Your men did kill Kirk's son. Do you deny these events?
KLINGON AMBASSADOR: We deny nothing! We have the right to preserve our race!
SAREK: Do you have the right to murder?
