I will randomly need to go to the bathroom and break down crying out of frustration every single day. Please help me, I don’t know what to do and feel like there is no hope left for me.
It happens almost every day. I’m so upset and with no hope whatsoever. I can’t do anything but lie in bed and think about how terrible and depressed I am. I’m a lost cause at this point. I’m worthless. There is literally nothing I can do. It’s been too long like this, suffering every day in silence and thinking about suicide all the time. I am tired of this life. I have no energy to do anything whatsoever.
