AUGGIE: ... If it happens, it happens. If it doesn't, it doesn't. Do you understand what I'm saying? You never know what's going to happen next, and the moment you think you know, that's the moment you don't know a goddamn thing. That's what we call a paradox. Are you following me?
JIMMY: Sure, Auggie. I follow. When you don't know nothing, it's like paradise. I know what that is. It's after you're dead and you go up to heaven and sit with the angels.
AUGGIE: Jesus, man, you're one fucking mess.
PAUL: It could have been worse. If the cops hadn't come, I might not be standing here now.
AUGGIE: Cops? You mean they nabbed those cruds?
PAUL: No. The ... uh ... the Bobbsey Twins lit out when they heard the sirens. But at least they stopped playing that marimba duet on my skull. Assaultus interruptus.
AUGGIE: Fuckus my assus. They did some number on you.
PAUL: For once in my life I managed to keep my mouth shut. There's something to be said for that, I suppose.
JIMMY: Does it hurt?
AUGGIE: Of course it hurts. What does it look like?
JIMMY: I thought maybe he was pretending.
PAUL: You haven't heard from Rashid, have you?
AUGGIE: Not a peep.
PAUL: I spoke to his aunt a couple of days ago, but she hasn't heard from him either. It's beginning to get a little scary.
AUGGIE: That could be a good sign, though. It could mean that he got away.
PAUL: Or didn't. There's no way of knowing, is there?
