Science fiction story where humanity is so technically advanced that they lack for nothing Many years ago I read a story (I think it was a full-length novel) set in the far future of Earth where people effectively can have whatever they want whenever they want it. I also believe they had immortality. Their main problems were decadence and ennui. I seem to remember that this was all available through technology. Their experience was real and not a Matrix-like virtual reality.
