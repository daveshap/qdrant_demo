Curry shits suck
Currently blowing up the restroom in a Mexican restaurant because my asshole needs to pay the Thai mafia it's debts from eating yellow curry at a Thai restaurant earlier today. My ass has the burning of a thousand suns going through it. 

In all seriousness, this is painful as all hell but damn was that yellow curry good. Anyone have foods like this that completely ruin them but it's so good you have to get it every now and then?
