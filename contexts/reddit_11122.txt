i confessed all my secrets to my dad
i'm 14 years old and i've been juuling and smoking weed for quite a long time now. recently i've noticed that it's impacting my life in a strongly negative way. last night i got to a really low point and thought that i was going to kill myself, so i called the national suicide prevention hotline (it works really well by the way, don't hesitate to call if you have any thoughts about self harm or suicide) and told them all about it. they advised me to tell my parents, so i did. a few minutes ago i gave my dad my juul and all the pods, and my bong.

wish me a good recovery guys.

edit: i've noticed a lot of comments about people saying that it isn't the weed and juul causing the suicidal thoughts so i feel i should clarify: i wrote it out poorly and it does seem like that's what i'm saying but i've been struggling with severe anxiety for my whole life, which is what's causing the suicide tendencies.

also, for the comments asking about my parents reaction they were both actually surprisingly calm and supportive about it. i'm in no trouble so far and all they've done is talk with me and make sure that i'm okay. i'm thankful to have parents as amazing as mine.
