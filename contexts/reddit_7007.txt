My dad is being laid off and has very little experience in searching and applying for jobs. Any tips?
My 55 year old dad is being laid off from the auditor job he’s had for 18 years at a telecom company. He’s already doing his best to get another job, but I would greatly appreciate any helpful tips or links I can send him. I’m about to go to college so I don’t have much experience with applications, especially at his level.
