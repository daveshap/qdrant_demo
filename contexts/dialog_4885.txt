TOM: It's the firs time I've seen you dressed like this. You look so clean and pretty.
JANE: What do you mean clean?
TOM: At work there's always this sort of film over you.
JANE: Well, thumps like me leave appearance to guys like you.
TOM: You're great at taking the edge off a good time.
TOM: You okay?
JANE: Yes. Just don't say anything mean for a while. Thanks.
