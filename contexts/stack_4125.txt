When flying back from India to the US with eVisa + green card, does one have to take any action immigration-wise before the flight? Bob holds a French passport, a US green card, and is visiting India on an\u00a0e-Visa (formerly known as tourist visa). He flew to India directly from the US. When flying back from India to the US, does Bob have to take any action immigration-wise?I'm asking as Bob was told when checking in his flight back that he was supposed to have asked for some kind of clearance at any US embassy in India.Answering the comments:Bob was allowed to check-in, after the airline employee called the embassy and waited 30 minutes for clearance. Bob was outside the US for three weeks. None of the travel documents had expired.The airline was Air India. Bob did indeed mention to the employees (4 employees got involved) that the green card should be enough to enter the US. Bob was told several times by the employees that he should have called the US embassy before taking the flight. No clear explanation was given to him despite repeatedly asking for clarification
