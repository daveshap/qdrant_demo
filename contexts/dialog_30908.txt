MIDDY: Do you have your ticket?
CHUCK: Yes.
MIDDY: Passport?
CHUCK: Look, I just better go.
CHUCK: Goodbye Mom. I'll be okay.
MIDDY: I know you will.
CHARLES: Make us proud.
CHUCK: Yes sir.
RICK: Albatross?
CHUCK: Yeah.
RICK: Rick March. Who the hell are you?
CHUCK: Gieg, Chuck.
RICK: Look, meet us out front when you're through. If they try to take anything away from you like Johnny Quest up there, just make a list and we'll have 'em send it down to the boat.
CHUCK: Whatever.
