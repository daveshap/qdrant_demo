ANNABELLE: You forgot to wash my purple shirt. I told you a hundred times it was Purple Day at school today.
RACHEL: I didn't forget. I was up all night thinking about it and I concluded you're too special to look like everyone else. Orange Red. That's your color. Few can carry it off. Now please. Help me find your brother.
ANNABELLE: You lost Ben?!
RACHEL: Of course not. Does he look lost to you? BENNNNN!!!
ANNABELLE: No. I told you. I like apple butter not butter butter.
RACHEL: Here.
ANNABELLE: Never mind. I'll just eat my lunch.
RACHEL: I'm almost done making it. Alright Ben -- <u>you</u> deal with the tardy, <u>you</u> write yourself a note, your daddy <u>told</u> you he had an important case this morning and he had to leave early and we were AAAAGGGGHHHH!
RACHEL: Oh my God. That is so not funny. You're late. You're really late. Now get out here and have some cereal.
BEN: No.
RACHEL: Fine! Eat in the cupboard.
BEN: No! Cocoa Puffs on Top -- Fruit Loops on the bottom.
RACHEL: Fine.
BEN: You touched it.
RACHEL: Then have a donut --
BEN: No.
RACHEL: Alright starve.
ANNABELLE: I'm gonna beep daddy at work.
RACHEL: He's badgering a witness. Eat.
BEN: But you told us to starve.
RACHEL: Hello?...Duncan...The Ad Agency's already there?...I'm out the door... Ben! Knock it off! It's gonna go beautifully... Damn it Ben --
ANNABELLE: You swore. You owe me a quarter. Did you remember my egg carton? I told you I needed my egg carton for seed planting today.
RACHEL: Absolutely Duncan I'm on top of everything.
RACHEL: ...EGGzactly. I'm putting on my coat -- We are late. We are seriously late. Which means Mister Ben we've got to get you dressed --
BEN: No!
