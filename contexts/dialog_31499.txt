WALTER: I know a place in the park where only very small birds go. There are no people or dogs or ugly crows and pigeons. It's quiet except for the song of these tiny sparrowlike birds. Would you like me to take you there?
ROBIN: They sound like finches.
WALTER: They could be finches. I don't know. We should go before it gets dark.
