UCLA Reject 4 times
I was rejected from UCLA 4 times. As a freshman, I was waitlisted then rejected. I decided to go to community college for two years, got a 4.0 GPA, participated in STEM conferences, held a full-time job, and won awards for tech innovation. I got rejected as a transfer, then I appealed and was rejected again. I don't know how I am such a bad candidate for UCLA that no matter how much I showed my passion for my major and to attend this school that I can't even get in. I am also a low-income and a minority as a reference. Alas, I have given up on UCLA after considering staying at community college for another year just to apply again. Cheers to all of my dreams growing up to be crushed by the one school that can't show me why I am not good enough for UCLA.

Disclosure: I am going to USC now.
