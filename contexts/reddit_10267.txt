I’ve started wishing that I would randomly die of a natural cause in order to avoid suicide.
Over the past month leading into June has been the worst its been in a while. Almost anything has sent me into the thoughts of killing myself. About two years ago I used to cut to deal with this but i stopped and have been clean since. I still sometimes drag slightly sharp items across my skin but never enough to cut or leave a mark. Now suicide is an every day thought in my head even on good days. Im a minor and not allowed to seek treatment or medicine. I firmly believe that when I go it will be due to my own hand. Whenever I get sick or feel pains that are abnormal, I no longer tell anyone in hope that it’ll kill me before I do and that my family and friends will have me dead due to something medical and not suicide. I don’t know what I believe in but I have even found myself praying to have a stroke or a heart attack just to end it all or praying to fall asleep and not wake up. I don’t know what to do anymore. Im struggling to live.
