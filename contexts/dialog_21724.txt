FLORENCE: I don't have any affairs. What do you mean?
CHARLOTTE: I don't think you could have a real affair. You couldn't care for anyone.
FLORENCE: I've been in love so many times my heart is calloused ... but I've never hit one with dough. This love-in-an-attic isn't my idea of a way to spend a pleasant afternoon.
CHARLOTTE: I don't agree with you.
FLORENCE: All right, you raise the kids -- I'll raise the roof. I'd rather die with an athletic heart from shaking cocktails and bankers, than expire in a pan of dirty dish water.
CHARLOTTE: You would.
FLORENCE: He can look like a chimpanzee and act like an igorot but he must have dough -- plenty of dough.
CHARLOTTE: You think money is the only requisite. It happens that the poor people are happier.
FLORENCE: Then marry Ralph ... you'll be the happiest couple in the world.
