PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN: You've convinced me that you must be who you say you are. No living human has ever seen this machine. But why? Why even in my twilight years would I remotely consider sending someone back in time?
MARTY: You didn't, Professor. It was an accident! You see, what happened --
PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN: No! Don't tell me! I don't want to know the future! My knowledge of future events... your mere presence here... could have devastating effects on the course of history. And altering history is a responsibility that I do not wish to bear. My immediate response is to send you back to your own time.
