DILLARD: Craddock!... Williams... Henshaw!... Banks!
CLAUDE: Here!
RAY: Maynard Banks, Esquire. Attorney at law.
CLAUDE: Gimme that. That doesn't concern you.
RAY: I'm sure it don't.
CLAUDE: What's up, Ray?
RAY: Claude.
CLAUDE: Sure is hot today. Think it'll rain later?
RAY: What do you want, Claude?
CLAUDE: What do I want? What makes you think I want something?
RAY: My daddy always said when a man starts talking about the weather keep you hand on your wallet.
CLAUDE: Your daddy must have been a helluva guy, a deep man, a wise man. Sure wish I could have met him --
RAY: Cut the bullshit. What do you want, Claude?
CLAUDE: You still got that map?
RAY: Yeah.
CLAUDE: Well, if you're still thinking about booking it, I want in. I think we can make it.
RAY: We? Did I hear you say we? As I recall, you're the one who said there is no we. Guess we got some bad news in that letter, huh?
CLAUDE: Look, my cousin Maynard is a lawyer. He filed an appeal on my behalf --
RAY: On your behalf. What happened to we?
CLAUDE: The appeal was denied. Then Daisy went and fell for Maynard. They're engaged to be married, can you believe that?
RAY: Well, let's just think about that for a moment. He's a successful lawyer up in New York City and you're down here with a bright future in the cotton picking business. Eeny, meeny, miney, Maynard.
CLAUDE: Come on, man. Don't shut me out. I'm telling you, you and me, that map, we can go places.
RAY: You know what, Claude? This whole time we've been down here, you've done nothing but think about yourself, acting like this whole thing is my fault. That plan with your cousin, did that include me?
CLAUDE: No.
RAY: At least you're honest for once. So now you want to be my friend? Well, let me tell you something, Claude-my- shit-don't-stink-Banks. You got a lot to learn about friendship.
CLAUDE: Does that mean I'm in?
RAY: I don't think so, Claude. You'd just slow me down. We'd have to stop every five minutes so you could polish your silverware. There's no way around it, you're soft.
CLAUDE: What'd you say?
RAY: I said you're soft.
CLAUDE: Don't call me that. You know I hate it when you call me that.
