Can't get over my ex even though I want to
My ex from three years ago made it clear that she doesn't ever want to talk, and I don't want to push the boundaries further than I already have. I can't stop obsessing (therapist suggested I might have OCPD) about her and all of the horrible things she did to me during our relationship and break up. I have been trying as hard as I can to get over her but I can't; therapy and psychiatry doesn't help, new girls don't help, working on myself doesn't help. I don't want to become an incel-type of guy but these thoughts are ruining my life. I just want to talk to her but I know I can't, and I don't want to start feeling entitled to her attention. My depression and anxiety just keep getting worse and worse because of this and I haven't felt genuine joy in years. I don't want to feel like this anymore, please help.
