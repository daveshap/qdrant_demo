JOHNSON: Last night's as much my fault as yours. If he's gonna put the blame on anybody --
CARTER: Hey, I was senior. It's OK. This is why I get the big bucks.
DIEL: I don't know what went wrong last night, but this department could've lost one detective and our only explosives expert.
CARTER: Sir, I can explain.
DIEL: What you did was dangerous and completely outside policy.
CARTER: I know, but --
DIEL: That's probably the only reason Johnson's still alive.
DIEL: Good job.
CARTER: Hey, sir, it was a pleasure to preserve Johnson's ass. Well...you know what I mean.
DIEL: I got a call from the F.B.I. The daughter of the Chinese Ambassador has been kidnapped and they asked for help. You're it.
CARTER: Feds asked for me?
DIEL: They asked for the best street man I had.
CARTER: And that, of course, would be me.
DIEL: Don't push it. You better watch your ass with these Fed types. If there's a screw-up, they won't think twice about burnin' it.
