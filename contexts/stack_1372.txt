How to get inverting amp in an electronics project with 1 battery I am trying to invert the signal from a microphone for a simple noise cancellation project.  I am using a 3.7V lipo battery, right now I am trying to use a single supply op amp (TLV2462), but don't know how to get the negative signal out.  I don't need much power/voltage out, I can boost power with a second stage, I'm mostly just concerned with getting a good inverted signal with 1 battery.
