JACOB: God almighty. What did you do to me?
LOUIS: I had to get in there. A deep adjustment. Rest a moment and let it set a bit.
JACOB: I had this weird flash just then.
LOUIS: What?
JACOB: I don't know. I've been having them recently. You know, you look like an angel, Louis, an overgrown cherub. Anyone ever tell you that?
LOUIS: Yeah. You. Every time I see you. No more Errol Flynn, okay? Your back won't take it. You tell your girl friend to calm down if she knows what's good for you.
JACOB: Louis, you're a life saver.
LOUIS: I know.
