Interested in NYU's Higher Education and Student Affairs (HESA) Program? Come to a webinar tonight at 8:30 PM EST!
Two NYU HESA second-year master's students and a first-year master's student (me) will be hosting a webinar at 8:30 PM EST tonight, 11/18, to answer any questions about what it's like to be a student at NYU and in NYC and present on the topic. I'll edit this post later to share the link to the YouTube video when we're done in case you're interested but can't make it.
