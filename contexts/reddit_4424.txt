My girlfriend is a beautiful soul who was dealt a bad hand. She has been faced with many tragedies and had a brain tumor when she was in high school that effected her fear and anxiety part of her brain. Most days are good but she has days where she spirals out of control and talks about “what if’s”, such as what if I get sick again with a tumor. Recently she has been saying she doesn’t even understand why she’s still here and why god let her live only to feel this way. I do my best to listen and give encouragement, but sometimes I feel lost for answers. My GF has very bright future she is about to start PA school which will come as a major challenge with stress and anxiety and I want to be able to help anyway I can. Please Reddit I appreciate any advice, I love this girl and hate to see her suffer like this.
