BUZZ: Now you're sure this spacefreighter will return to its port of origin once it jettisons its food supply?
WOODY: Uh-huh. And when we get there, we'll be able to find a way to transport you...home.
BUZZ: Well, then let's climb abroad.
WOODY: No, no, no, wait, Buzz, Buzz, let's get in the back. No one will see us there.
BUZZ: Negative. There are no restraining harnesses in the cargo area. We'll be much safer in the cockpit.
