HOLLAND: Good morning, Miss Connell.
BETSY: Good morning.
HOLLAND: I heard about your little misadventure yesterday, Miss Connell. On your first day off
BETSY: Well, I had a good time up to a point.
HOLLAND: Wesley can be very entertaining.
BETSY: Yes, he can. But I've been wondering -- you know if you could leave the whisky decanter off the table --
HOLLAND: It's always stood there, Miss Connell. I can remember it in my grandfather's time and my father's. I'm afraid it will have to remain.
BETSY: But for Wes -- it must be a temptation to him.
HOLLAND: I've no sympathy with people who can't resist temptation.
BETSY: Still, I feel you should remove the decanter. Wes is not an alcoholic yet, Mr. Holland. But as a nurse I can tell you that it won't be long before he is.
HOLLAND: I'm afraid the decanter will have to stay where it is. I engaged you, Miss Connell, to take care of my wife, not my brother.
BETSY: You don't seem very disturbed by it. I've always thought Voodoo was something to be scared of: the drums sounded in the hills and everybody was frightened.
HOLLAND: I'm afraid it's not very frightening. They have their songs and dances and carry on and finally, as I understand it, one of the gods comes down and speaks through one of the people.
