Should I or Should I Not Go on a Potentially Amazing Trip
Okay. I'm honestly extremely stressed out so please help me.

So every year my school goes on a trip, and I was able to attend last year's but this year's is extremely expensive -- $1,500 expensive.

The entire year I thought I wouldn't go, but my friends continued to talk about how much they wanted to go and ask why I'm not going so it started to pester me a bit.

There is an opportunity for me to hop in on the payments now, but the date is next month, and I'd have to earn it all in a month basically, instead gradually over an entire year.

There are fundraisers that we have, but it's hard to make real profit off of them. We have boxes of chocolate, but it takes a while to sell since there's 60 to a box, one box only gives $30 towards my account.

This whole trip thing stressed my mom out before we decided I wouldn't go, and now I'm bringing it up again so I feel like I'm making things worse.

I don't know how I'll be able to sell enough to really make a dent when I only earn $30 at a time, and I only have until the 22nd of next month! I went on the trip last year, and I have been where we are going now so the only new thing will be that I'm there with friends.

Can someone please tell me if this is all worth it?
