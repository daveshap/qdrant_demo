Gold Star families have sent a letter to Donald Trump demanding he apologize over remarks made to the Khan family, and John McCain has issued a lengthy rebuke of Trump. Is this indicative of a fracture within the Republican party?
If you missed it, [Khizr Khan gave an emotionally charged speech at the DNC about his muslim son's heroic sacrifice in 2004.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z7lN7nQjG0) 

Afterwards, in an interview with George Stephanopoulos, [Trump argued he had been viciously attacked, and said that he had experienced sacrifice just as the Khans had](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWdQD0SANgY). 

This was met with bipartisan outrage, and much anger from the Republican leadership.

[From a Gold Star family group:](http://edition.cnn.com/2016/08/01/politics/gold-star-families-trump-apology/)

>Your recent comments regarding the Khan family were repugnant and personally offensive to us.  We feel we must speak out and demand you apologize to the Khans, to all Gold Star families, and to all Americans for your offensive, and frankly anti-American comments.

[Senator John McCain's lengthy statement:
](http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/01/politics/john-mccain-statement-khan-family/index.html)
> In recent days, Donald Trump disparaged a fallen soldier's parents. He has suggested that the likes of their son should not be allowed in the United States â€” to say nothing of entering its service. I cannot emphasize enough how deeply I disagree with Mr. Trump's statement. I hope Americans understand that the remarks do not represent the views of our Republican Party, its officers, or candidates.

Do these condemnations indicate an underlying fracture in the GOP over Trump?  While not many prominent Republicans were at the RNC last week, we have not seen this level of scathing rebukes yet in this race, not even after the Judge Curiel comments.
