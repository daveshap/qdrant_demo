Brother comes home drunk every night
My brother is 18, and every night he comes home drunk and he'll go into my mom's room and sometimes when he's sober he'll do this joke where he pretends to get into her bed but when he's drunk he's dead serious. My mom makes him stop but he doesn't. Everytime this escalates, and leaves my mom, or this time in particular, him and my mom in tears. My brother also smokes (weed) on the daily, I really worry about him. Obviously this is a problem bigger just than how I feel, but I'm just really worried about my brother as he's going off to college in two months
