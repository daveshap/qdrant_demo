Compute coordinates of vector line? I have a set of vector lines (which represent translation vectors for georeferencing).Based on the layer CRS, how can I compute the coordinates of each line in an attribute table ?i.e (Xmax-Xmin; Ymax-Ymin) for each line.I have managed to get the line length with $length in the expression editor but I am struggling with other geometrical parameters.Edit: I am looking to \"store the formula\" within the layer. The idea is to keep these values automatically updated with the geometry. (Auto)update should happen if a new line is added or modification of the current geometry is done.
