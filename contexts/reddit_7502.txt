I’m going to attempt to solely use my iPad
I just purchased a brand new iPad Pro, I’m loving it. I don’t see why I wouldn’t be able to fully rely on an iPad for notes, books, papers and etc. 

Does anyone else do this? 

I’m currently exploring apps to get a feel for them before my MS program begins. So far, I’ve downloaded notability and GoodNotes. Any other good apps that are recommended?
