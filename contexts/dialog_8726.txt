PETERS: Here's another one. They're all over the place.
WEIR: They're explosive charges.
MILLER: I can see that, what're they for?
WEIR: In an emergency, the charges detonate in series, destroying the central section and separating the personnel areas from the rest of the ship. That way, if the gravity drive malfunctions, the crew could use the foredecks as a lifeboat.
PETERS: That means they didn't abandon ship.
MILLER: So where are they? Starck, any luck with the bio-scan?
