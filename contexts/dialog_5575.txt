FERGUS: Dil! Dil! What the fuck are you doing here?
DIL: I'm going home!
FERGUS: Told you to stay in the hotel!
DIL: Thought you was fooling me. Thought you was leaving me.
FERGUS: I had to go to work!
DIL: Stayed all day in that room thinking every noise was you. There's something you're not telling me, Jimmy.
FERGUS: Come on...
DIL: No! I'm going home...
DIL: So tell me.
FERGUS: I was trying to get out of something.
DIL: No! Tell me everything, Jimmy.
FERGUS: You got to forget you ever saw me, Dil.
DIL: You mean that?
FERGUS: Yes.
