Have I messed up too badly?
Hello this may not be the best subreddit for my questions and concerns but I couldn't find any better place to ask these questions, so please forgive me if this isn't the right place. 

I'm a sophomore at a local in state university and as of last spring semester I was put onto academic probation as I was struggling with a full 18 credit course load on top of depression and growing anxiety of being overwhelmed with all the new information and life style that comes with being on my own and in charge of my life. 

This being said as I came into this fall semester I decided to reach for a more difficult engineering major and decided that because I was on academic probation and behind in the study as far as course go I needed to take a rugid bit light 15 credit course load. 

However I ended up taking Chemistry(which I never took in high school) and an advanced physics course for engineering majors. I did not do well as the new concepts of chemistry was very difficult to learn and so I spent too much time on that one subject meanwhile everything else didn't get much time focused on it. This led to me getting a horrible GPA of a 1.55 for this semester and dragging my cumulative GPA down under a 2.0 when my goal for this semester was to achieve a 2.2 at the bare minimum to appease my academic progress plan. 

I feel like such a failure after actually putting as much effort into the semester as I could and so far the college has dismissed me and has offered an appeal process for both the dismissal and a reevaluation of my academic standing and financial aid. 

I'm going to try to appeal this but I came here looking to see if anyone has any advice as to what my next steps should be. 

Any thoughts and/or advice is helpful.
