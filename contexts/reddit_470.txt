Stupid question from a middle school girl about a crush
School started a week ago for me and since last year I've had a crush on a boy at my school, ugh. We aren't friends, I just like his personality and I find him funny, but I "hate" him and whatever, so we don't talk, but when we were in two of the same classes (last year) sometimes I would be in his group or I would get to be around him, but now I don't have any classes with him and I only see him around lunch and recess time. Whats some advice to get over a crush or how I can find ways to talk to him or be around him. If you answer my stupid question, thanks, I know its weird, I just don't talk to my friends about this or whatever as I said I "hate" him. Thanks.
