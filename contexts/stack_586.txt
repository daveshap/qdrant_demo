Is there any way I can prevent Ubuntu 16 from freezing under heavy CPU load? I'm a developer working a lot with Android Studio. When it compiles the Java classes it spins up 4+ threads of CPU intensive work. Often I play music in the background when that goes on. Here's what happens:The music skips or completely stops at the most intensive section of the compilationThe mouse point jitters or stops responding altogetherMost often things normalize after compilation is done, but other times the computer freezes totally and I have to hard reset it. How come? Is not Linux/Ubuntu/Unity designed to prioritize the UI thread? How does it allow Java to take 100% of the CPU resources? Is there any way I can throttle this?Disclaimer: I don't know much about OS code.
