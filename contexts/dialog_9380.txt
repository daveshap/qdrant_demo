GONZO: Yeah... I thought we might need it...
DUKE: What for?
GONZO: Let's go up there and blast him out of bed with the fire hose.
DUKE: No, we should leave the poor bastard alone. I get the feeling that he's avoiding us for some reason.
GONZO: Don't kid yourself. That Portuguese son of a bitch is dangerous. He's watching us like a hawk.
DUKE: He told me he was turning in early...
GONZO: That dirty bastard! I knew it! He's got hold of my woman!
DUKE: That little blonde groupie with the film crew? You think he sodomized her?
GONZO: That's right, laugh about it! You goddamn honkies are all the same!
DUKE: Where'd you get that knife?
GONZO: Room service sent it up. I wanted something to cut the limes.
DUKE: What limes?
GONZO: They didn't have any. They don't grow in the desert.
