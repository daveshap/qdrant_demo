Is the relative speed of light really invariant, irrespective of the motion of the observer? If 3 observers are on a planet which 100 light years from a star, and the star goes supernova, if one observer moves towards the star and one moves in the opposite direction, each observer will see the explosion at a different time. The observer who stays on the planet, sees the explosion a hundred years after it occurs. The person moving towards the star, sees it in less than a hundred years, while the person moving in the opposite direction, will see it more than 100 years after it occured. Doesn't this prove that the speed of light, relative to a moving observer, is not invariant.
