SCHAEFER: You've been pushing too many Pencils, Dillon. Had enough?
DILLON: No way, old buddy.
SCHAEFER: You never did know when to quit.
DILLON: That piece of work you guys pulled off at the Berlin embassy last week was really something. Blew the entry points on three floors and neutralized the opposition in eight seconds flat. Beautiful.
SCHAEFER: Like the old days, Dillon.
DILLON: Also heard that you passed on that little job in Libya.
SCHAEFER: Wasn't my style. We're a rescue unit, not assassins. This must be good. Big shot from the CIA, leaves his desk to come back to the bush. What's so important?
DILLON: Those cabinet members are very important to our scope of operations in this part of the world. They're about to get squeezed. We can't let that happen. I needed someone who could get the job done, quick and quiet... no screw-ups. I needed the best. The best. So, I pulled a few strings at the State Department... and here we are.
SCHAEFER: Go on.
