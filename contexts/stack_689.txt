Change VLC Home Directory I just installed VLC 3.0 via snap. Unlike the previous versions nothing shows up now when I click \"My Music\" or \"My Videos\". I think it set the wrong base directory./home/gratis/snap/vlc/158 is where .cache , .config etc. are so I would guess that's currently set to be the home directory. I don't require VLC to move all it's files, I would just like it to locate my stuff, which is /home/gratis/Music ,and /home/gratis/Videos respectively.
