ZACK: I shouldn't have done that. I should've walked.
PAULA: He didn't give you much choice.
ZACK: There's always a choice.
PAULA: Where'd you learn to fight like that?
ZACK: I don't feel like talking, if you don't mind.
PAULA: Opening up just a little wouldn't kill you, ya know.
ZACK: You want me to fuck you? Is that it? Okay, come here. Take your clothes off. Get into bed.
PAULA: Where's that coming from? I wouldn't fuck now if my life depended on it!
ZACK: Forget it. Just get out of here.
PAULA: I don't know who you think you're talking to! I ain't some whore you brought here! I've been trying to be your friend and you treat me like shit!
ZACK: Be a friend. Leave.
PAULA: You got no manners and you never tell the truth! You're nothin' special. And if you ask me, you got no chance at all of being an officer!
