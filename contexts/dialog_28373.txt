GONDORFF: Turn the goddamn thing off, will ya.
HOOKER: You sober?
GONDORFF: I can talk, can't I?
GONDORFF: Glad to meet ya, kid. You're a real horse's ass.
HOOKER: Yeh, Luther said you could teach me something. I already know how to drink.
GONDORFF: I'm sorry about Luther. He was the best street worker I ever saw.
HOOKER: He had you down as a big-timer. What happened?
GONDORFF: Aw, I conned a Senator from Florida on a stocks deal. A real lop-ear. He thought he was gonna take over General Electric. Some Chantoozie woke him up, though, and he put the feds on me.
HOOKER: You mean you blew it.
GONDORFF: Luther didn't tell me you had a big mouth.
HOOKER: He didn't tell me you was a fuck- up, either. You played the Big Con since then.
GONDORFF: No, I lammed it around for a while while things cooled off. Philly, Denver, Baltimore, nuthin' towns.
