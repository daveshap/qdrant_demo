Update: my boss told me today that I oversold myself in the interview: I got fired yesterday.
Well the title pretty much says it all. For background please check out my original post 2 weeks ago (link below) . What I wanted to say is that it's really starting to look like my boss set me up to get fired. I don't think they wanted me there in the first place but as I said it was a family owned company and I feel like their oldest brother who owns the company and hired me was the only one who liked me so the rest of them all had to kind of work with me. My boss (their sister) would literally not give me any work and then complain about me not working. She would not give me any guidance and then accuse me of not taking initiative, how am I supposed to take initiatives on things I don't know about. And then they told me in the firing meeting that they thought I would just come in and take over the responsibilities on my own. Seriously how? They literally told me nothing about what I'm supposed to do except help their sister. Thats the only job description I got. Besides, we didn't have much projects over the summer, and I perfectly worked them last one and another one I was working on. When they hired me they didn't look at my transcripts or anything although I offered. Geez people are weird man. I'm honestly glad I got fired. It's like a burden being lifted. Seriously feeling so much better. Because this whole time I really thought I was the one to blame. My confidence is back. 
Sidenote: people who spend that much time with their family seem weird to me.
