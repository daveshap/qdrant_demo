Anyone else feeling inferior compared to classmates?
I was going through my high school's  "class of 2020" facebook page. There are so many people who did incredible things and going to wonderful places. I'm proud of them but also can't help comparing myself. I'm going to Loyola MD which is a great school and I love it very much but I keep getting down on myself seeing classmates who were just as good as me in classes go to t20s and public ivies. My hs is rated top in the county and top 20 in the state so I guess it's to be expected. Anyone else feel this way or have I lost my mind?
