DONNA: Where are you going?
LAURA: No place, fast. And you're not coming.
DONNA: Come on, Laura. I'm your best friend.
LAURA: Isn't tonight the night you are going to do it with Mike?
DONNA: Laura, aren't you going to fix me a drink?
DONNA: Where are the Cookies?
LAURA: You mean Fred and Ginger?
DONNA: Dancing.
DONNA: If I had a nickel for every cigarette your mom smoked, I'd be dead.
LAURA: Gotta go, Donna. I'll call you tomorrow.
