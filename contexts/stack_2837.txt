Where does energy in osmosis come from? So I get that work is done when a net force converts potential to heat or kinetic. But I also understand that osmosis is driven purely by entropic processes. There is no net force, only a statistical change driven by random motion. So where does the energy, aka osmotic power or pressure actually come from. It seems contradictory that it is purely entropic yet releases free energy.
