SIDRA: Yeah, four years ago. They had me staying in this tiny-ass town with like fifty people. I'm not playing, there was about a thousand goats running around, and it gets dark at four o'clock. Then the whack club I'm on loses three games in a row and I get blamed. So they fire me.
MONICA: Just like that?
SIDRA: Yup. So I've been playing with this Italian club the last three years.
MONICA: How's that been?
SIDRA: It's better. Even though the whole first season my teammates didn't pass to me cause they were mad The American" was making more money. I led the team in rebounds cause it was the only way I could touch the damn ball."
