Is there a way that I can know the user names of a server? My server has been hacked a few days ago and now I decide to ban root user remote login. Is there a way that an attacker can scan my own added user name? (As far as know the answer is NO?). If so, I don't have to set a too strong password for the new user. I mean, it would be far more difficult to guess my custom user name than \"root + password\".
