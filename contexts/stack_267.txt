Mojave macOS Installation Error (com.apple.DiskManagement error 69854) I tried upgrading from High Sierra to Mojave on my MacBook Pro mid-2012 Non Retina, 16GB RAM and 500GB HDD, core i7.Unfortunately I don't have a backup and I keep getting this error \"com.apple.DiskManagement error 69854\" during the installation. I can only access into Recovery.How can I solve this error and install Mojave without losing my data?
