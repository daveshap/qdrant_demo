I have no friends. Nobody ever contacts me first
And I'm okay with it. I'm a failed professional who is miles behind academically and professionally my friends. So I don't care about seeing them. They never contact me first and I haven't bothered my ass to contact them in months. I'm at a point now where I say fuck it do I live a life without friends or just end it all now and find peace

Forgot to mention I have zero self esteem
