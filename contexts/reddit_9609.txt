Can I get a breakdown of NACA/ACUHO-I/NODA summer internships?
Howdy all, 

I'm a first year grad in a student affairs administration program, currently GAing in housing. I don't really know what my goals are long-term job wise upon graduation, but hoping to get a better breadth of experience the next few semesters.

I'm a little confused on what all the summer internship programs are (one is required for my program). Obviously, I'm somewhat familiar with ACUHO-I, but NACA and NODA are two programs I've been recommended, but have no idea what they really are. Could anyone give me rough breakdown of what they are, are they paid, time commitments, etc.? I think that'd be really helpful!
