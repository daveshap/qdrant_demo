Browsing this sub, noticed a common thread. Some advice.
I have started browsing this sub recently and noticed a common thread. I see people who get into financial trouble or lose their job when their car breaks down and they cannot afford the repairs. I have been in the automotive repair business for 15 years and often try my best to help people who are financially stricken. I can offer free advice on how to make repairs yourself to get you back on the road. I regularly service and have in depth knowledge on vehicles of all makes and models (barring exotics). I can tell you how to replace timing belts, CV shafts, wheel bearings, diagnose misfire, ect. Unfortunately, my advice is U.S. centric since that is the market I am familiar with. If someone wants to attempt a repair themselves, I can walk them through the steps and tools required. I started off repairing vehicles for students at a nearby college campus in a Walmart parking lot so I am aquatinted with roadside repair work.
