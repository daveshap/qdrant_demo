Concurrent central and peripheral mode with BLE I'm having an ARM M3 which I would like to connect on one hand to a smart phone for data visualization and to two sensors for data acquisition on the other hand. Both connections should be BLE.My understanding is that this would require concurrent mode (central to peripheral), where peripheral is required to talk to the smart phone and central to talk to the sensors, correct?I have a BLUENRG-132 from ST around but could find any information regarding concurrent mode. Is this normally supported by these devices or do I have to implement some kind of switching myself? Or isn't possible at all?
