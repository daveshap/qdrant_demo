Long (500ms) Pulse Extender I have an SPST momentary tactile switch and want the pulse, whatever length, to be extended to 500ms (unless of course the button is pressed for longer than 500ms but we can ignore that if we hold the pulse form the rising edge). I don't know if there is a single IC to hold a pulse like this or if I can do it with passive components like resistors and capacitors.
