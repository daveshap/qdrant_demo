QUINTUS: Serious stuff...
NARCISSUS: Centurions on both sides of the river are convinced the Germans will try one last offensive. They've got nothing to lose and it's so very like them.
COMMODUS: I'm ordering a general stand-down in preparation for withdrawal back across the Danube.
NARCISSUS: We have to stop the Germans now!
QUINTUS: We must obey our emperor and the Senate.
COMMODUS: I met with Falco, and the Senators have agreed to call for a truce with the Germans.
NARCISSUS: Forgive me, Caesar, but do two Senator represent the mood of the whole Senate or the will of the Roman people? Besides, every truce we make with the Germans they break!
COMMODUS: They won't break this one.
NARCISSUS: Apparently my opinion wasn't needed.
QUINTUS: Everyone knew you would have been outspoken against this deal.
NARCISSUS: What deal?
QUINTUS: Rome is going to pay an allotment to the German tribes on an annual basis.
NARCISSUS: Rome is going to pay tribute -- like a defeated nation begging for mercy? Have you told your troops that?
QUINTUS: My troops don't make policy.
NARCISSUS: Well, they die for it!
