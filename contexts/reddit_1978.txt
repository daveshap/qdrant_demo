Isnâ€™t it crazy that someone actually READ your application
Iâ€™ve been thinking about this ever since I got into Northeastern, because I find it so crazy. Someone actually read my application, read my essay, my ECs, saw my grades, and actually liked me, liked me enough to give me a scholarship??? like wtf, and thought Iâ€™m a good fit for their school. I just think thatâ€™s really cute, thank u AOâ€™s that chose meðŸ¥ºðŸ¥ºðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°
