HARRY: A lot of people are going to be really pissed off when they discover you're still alive.
SWANN: They'll never find out.
HARRY: Look, Ma, no wires.
SWANN: You shouldn't have followed me, D'Amour.
HARRY: How the fuck do you do that?
SWANN: Now I'm going to have to kill you.
HARRY: I don't think so. You need me alive.
SWANN: Why? So you can fuck my wife?
