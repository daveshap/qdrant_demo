My organization has just laid off 3 colleagues in really bad fashion and it’s making me nervous and considering starting to look elsewhere.
My org recently got rid of a few director level people. I’m vying for a senior position and seeing how these directors got treated makes me think it’s a thankless job that is short lived. The way they got rid of them was poor too, they hired other people from outside into a role that is kind of similar, then told all the existing ones their jobs aren’t required, took their computers and access cards and walked them out of the building.

On the side I have already been approached by various other places but have declined because the org I’m in now pays a lot higher than anyone else. I’m basically earning 20-30% more than colleagues in other organizations. But is that enough? For the peace of mind and stability I’m thinking of just taking a 20-30% pay cut into a place that treats their people better.

Anyone else seen this type of behavior? Is it poor culture or just normal practice these days?
