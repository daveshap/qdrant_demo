DELIA: All right, you dead people! Come on out, or we'll break down this door and drag you out on the ropes you hanged yourself with!
LYDIA: Shhhh. They didn't commit suicide.
DELIA: It doesn't matter. What matters is I've got a roomful of guests down there, who think I'm a fraud. I am going to teach you something here Lydia. You've <u>got</u> to take the right tone in things like this, or people -- whether they're dead or alive -- people will walk all <u>over</u> you. Come on out, or I will make death so miserable that you will wish you had never <u>lived</u>!
