Has anyone here ever screamed/felt like screaming from how anxious and overwhelmed you feel? I need someone to understand
Hi...I'm writing this while I have a small panic attack. Okay so one of my biggest fears is that I'm gonna feel so anxious and overwhelmed that I'm just gonna start screaming. I get scared I'm gonna do it in public or around people that don't understand my situation. And I haven't done it so far. I've always had anxiety but it got worse in the summer of 2019. I know that if I were to scream, I would have to stop eventually and it calms me a little bit but then I get another panic attack and the fear comes back. I feel really lost and like I'm actually going crazy (I know that's just anxiety talking haha). My dad has been a huge help because he also suffered from anxiety/depression so I know I have someone to talk to. He's been my greatest inspiration to keep moving forward. However I wanted to know how other people felt. Any tips or words of encouragement will gladly be appreciated.
