does anyone else have an extremely chill side to them
like yeah, i have crippling social anxiety, but also half the time i just don’t care about anything at all and i act so chill and depending on the situation i’m either panicking on the verge of a mental breakdown or don’t have a care in the world and there’s no in between. i feel like i don’t even know what i’m actually like. i like to think i’m super chill but i’m probably not. am i crazy or are other people like this lmao.
