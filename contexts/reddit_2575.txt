How do you stay positive while on the job hunt?
It's been 2 months since I've been laid off, currently working at Starbucks (and getting physically and mentally exhausted), in a online masters program, and flat broke. I've been getting interviews and received many compliments from the places I've interviewed at. But I've heard nothing back. Not even from recruiters I was working with. 

I'm still applying like crazy, and doing my best to avoid a scam, but I'm tired. I'm so disappointed by the results so far and I feel like giving up. It's really difficult to stay positive. Im  pushing 30 and I don't have a career. Last year, I've barely made $20k. I'm embarrassed at myself. I've made a promise to myself to never have that as your total amount again.

Those who have been on the job hunt, how did you do it? How have you stay positive? Any answers is welcomed. Thanks

EDIT: Thanks everyone for the responses. Overwhelmed by the support.
