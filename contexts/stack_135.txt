10.13.4 = 1 fewer monitors on my MacBook Pro mid 2012 (non-Retina)? I have a 2012 MBP non-retina.  I've been running 2 old CRT's along with the laptops monitor.  One CRT is connected through a Thunderbolt converter, and the other through a DVI/USB converter.  When my system automatically updated to 10.13.4 today, I soon learned that: 10.13.4 does not support the USB converter... which I guess Apple considers an 'enhancement'?  Just looking for some clever ideas as to how I might regain my expansive desktop, without 'having' to Time Machine back to 10.13.3.
