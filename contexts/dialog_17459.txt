SUSAN: Hi, everybody. Sorry to be late -- had to have dinner with my depart- ment chief --
ALLISON: You ate?
SUSAN: ...I'm here, aren't I? Wouldn't miss a loose end meeting. What's on the table for discussion? Party favors, flowers -- hi Dad, hi Drew --
PARRISH: You know each other?
SUSAN: We've met.
PARRISH: What?!
SUSAN: -- This morning. The Corinth Coffee Shop. He was looking for a doctor.
QUINCE: Well, I guess he's found one.
DREW: Joe, you do get around.
SUSAN: That's your name?
ALLISON: And isn't it a lovely one? So sturdy, so straight --
DREW: Incidentally, Joe, where're you staying?
JOE: Here...
DREW: 'Here'?
