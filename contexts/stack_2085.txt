What does \"standing on someone\u2019s shoulders\" really mean? I'm translating the following passage, which is said by a black woman living in America:<blockquote>  But the doctor was right: I was depressed. Like most people in my       community, I had the misconception that depression was a sign of weakness,       a character flaw. But I wasn't weak; I was a high achiever. I was too       ashamed. I didn't think I had the right to be depressed. I had a       privileged life with a loving family and a successful career. And when I       thought about the unspeakable horrors that my ancestors had been through       in this country so that I could have it better, my shame grew even deeper.       I was standing on their shoulders. How could I let them down? I would hold       my head up, put a smile on my face and never tell a soul.</blockquote>I need to know what the sentence I was standing on their shoulders mean? Does it mean I had to continue the way they had started? Does it mean I had much better conditions than theirs?
