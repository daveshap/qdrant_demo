RUBY: Three. Where's my client?
HAYES: Your... client is being booked right now. He'll be in cell five.
RUBY: What are the charges?
HAYES: Shit. We're still putting the victim list together. You'll need a forklift for the case file. I suggest you hire some help, and don't expect to get a lot of sleep for the next few months. You're about to defend the most notorious serial killer in American history.
RUBY: I thought that was Ted Bundy.
HAYES: Compared to this guy... amateur.
RUBY: A house?
HAYES: That's right. Wasn't on any of the maps... we could barely see it through the underbrush. Place must've been abandoned for twenty years.
