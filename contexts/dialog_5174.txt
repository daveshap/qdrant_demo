RENAULT: How observant you are. As a matter of fact, I wanted to give you a word of advice.
RICK: Yeah? Have a brandy?
RENAULT: Thank you. Rick, there are many exit visas sold in this cafe, but we know that you have never sold one. That is the reason we permit you to remain open.
RICK: I thought it was because we let you win at roulette.
RENAULT: That is another reason. There is a man who's arrived in Casablanca on his way to America. He will offer a fortune to anyone who will furnish him with an exit visa.
RICK: Yeah? What's his name?
RENAULT: Victor Laszlo.
RICK: Victor Laszlo?
RENAULT: Rick, that is the first time I have ever seen you so impressed.
RICK: Well, he's succeeded in impressing half the world.
RENAULT: It is my duty to see that he doesn't impress the other half. Rick, Laszlo must never reach America. He stays in Casablanca.
RICK: It'll be interesting to see how he manages.
RENAULT: Manages what?
RICK: His escape.
RENAULT: Oh, but I just told you. --
RICK: -- Stop it. He escaped from a concentration camp and the Nazis have been chasing him all over Europe.
RENAULT: This is the end of the chase.
RICK: Twenty thousand francs says it isn't.
RENAULT: Is that a serious offer?
RICK: I just paid out twenty. I'd like to get it back.
RENAULT: Make it ten. I am only a poor corrupt official.
RICK: Okay.
RENAULT: Done. No matter how clever he is, he still needs an exit visa, or I should say, two.
RICK: Why two?
RENAULT: He is traveling with a lady.
RICK: He'll take one.
RENAULT: I think not. I have seen the lady. And if he did not leave her in Marseilles, or in Oran, he certainly won't leave her in Casablanca.
RICK: Maybe he's not quite as romantic as you are.
RENAULT: It doesn't matter. There is no exit visa for him.
RICK: Louis, whatever gave you the impression that I might be interested in helping Laszlo escape?
RENAULT: Because, my dear Ricky, I suspect that under that cynical shell you're at heart a sentimentalist.
RENAULT: Oh, laugh if you will, but I happen to be familiar with your record. Let me point out just two items. In 1935 you ran guns to Ethiopia. In 1936, you fought in Spain on the Loyalist side.
RICK: And got well paid for it on both occasions.
RENAULT: The winning side would have paid you much better.
RICK: Maybe. Well, it seems you are determined to keep Laszlo here.
RENAULT: I have my orders.
RICK: Oh, I see. Gestapo spank.
