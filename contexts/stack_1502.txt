How to amplify RF signal to high enough level for a CMOS downconverting mixer? I've been reading original academic papers on mixers and now a RF textbook and I have been unable to understand a very basic thing, which is how do I get a RF signal, say -65 dBm, at a high enough voltage level for input into a CMOS-based downconverting mixer?  Everything I read shows a LNA blackbox, which is fine and good, but LNAs amplify signals at what, 15-20 dB typically?  How on earth is that even remotely close to activating a CMOS NPN transistor in the mixer with a typical threshold voltage of 700mV?  +15dB gain on -65 dBm doesn't get it to 700mV+.  And chaining multiple LNAs to get it to 700mV+ would destroy the signal with noise, no?I know I'm missing something extremely obvious here so be kind.  I'm just starting out.  I know there's a lot more to downconversion (filtering, etc).  This question is solely about the initial amplification.
