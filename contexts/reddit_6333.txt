do any of you guys get extremely nervous on your first day?
today was my first day and honestly it was nerve wrecking.  

i tried to make a best first impression to my boss and co workers but you never know what people think of you.  i feel like i made stupid comments or (mean..) idk. how do i stop overthinking?
