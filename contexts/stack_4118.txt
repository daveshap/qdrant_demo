Does visiting Cyprus via a multiple-entry Schengen visa count towards the maximum length of stay of the visa? A person obtained a multiple-entry Schengen visa with a duration of stay of 90 days and a validity of a year.If this person stays in the Schengen zone 70 days and then goes on vacation in Cyprus for 30 days, will the person be allowed back into the Schengen zone for the remaining 20 days, or will these 30 days in Cyprus count towards the duration of stay limit of the Schengen visa and make the visa expired?
