KOPALSKI: Let's fill it with confitures, des prunes...
BULJANOFF: ...des raisins de Madère, des framboises...
IRANOFF: ...des petites fraises des bois... de la crème de Bretagne...
KOPALSKI: ...so it blows up that big... what they call an Omelette Surprise!
BULJANOFF: And the surprise is there's nothing in it.
KOPALSKI: I know, but if we can't put in all these wonderful things at least let's put in some imagination. In that one omelet we'll taste the whole of Paris!
