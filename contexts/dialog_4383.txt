JEREMIAH: Listen to me, boy. I didn't work all my life to get out of this neighborhood for you to move right back in!
PATRICK: I thought you'd be psyched. Just trying to do what you did. Take nothing and make something out of it.
JEREMIAH: No one'll ever come here. Shut it down. Don't worry, the bank'll buy it back. I'll take care of it.
PATRICK: You'll take care of it? Not this time. No way. I bought it fair and square. And we open tonight.
JEREMIAH: Bullshit! Bullshit!! You're selling it back! That's an order!
