DOYLE: Do you swear that the testimony you are about to give before this committee of the United States House of Representatives will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you god?
PETE: I do.
DOYLE: Be seated and state your full name and place of residence for the record.
PETE: Peter Kenneth Appleton. Hollywood, California.
DOYLE: The chair notes that you are appearing without the benefit of counsel today, Mr. Appleton. We certainly hope this means that you intend to be fully forthcoming with this committee?
PETE: I'll do my best, Mr. Chairman.
DOYLE: Now, we're informed that you have a statement you'd like to read, is that correct?
PETE: A statement?
DOYLE: Yes. A prepared statement.
PETE: Um... no. I don't have a statement at this time.
