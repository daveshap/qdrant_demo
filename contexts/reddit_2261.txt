things i've learned while writing my essays...
1. the first draft is never perfect
2. neither is the second draft, tbh
3. nor the third draft
4. speaking of never perfect, the first idea you come with won't be the one you stick with
5. neither is the second idea
6. you get my drift?
7. don't be afraid to start over; you might like the sentence you just wrote but stop trying to shove into your essays where it doesn't fit
8. whatever you do, don't try to edit while writing. you'll get stuck on one paragraph and you'll never move on (trust me. i spent 5 hours trying to write one paragraph)
9. on a related note, don't be afraid to skip around. if you REALLY can't word something perfectly now, make a note (i like to use \[insert \_\_\_\_ here\]) and keep going. don't let it slow you down
10. if you're finally satisfied, congrats! come back to it in a day and reconsider. edit. start over if necessary. rinse and repeat.
11. balance college apps with school. don't check the time and realize it's almost midnight and you haven't started your homework
12. take everything on this subreddit with a grain of salt. it has good advice, but don't let it control you
13. take a break. walk around the house, talk to your parents, play with your pet, or switch gears. it'll clear your head and help the ideas flow better the next time you sit down to write
14. eat a snack and blame the stress
15. i like listening to white noise while i work. or lo-fi. but anything with lyrics or anything i even vaguely know the tune to? absolutely not. turn off anything that might distract you.

please add on! a lot of these have been reiterated on this sub thousands of times, but these are the things i came to realize while writing my common app essay. i am the worst at writing essays bc concentrating isn't my strong suit and i'm an obsessed perfectionist, but some of these really helped! 

proof? i finally finished my rough draft last night :)
