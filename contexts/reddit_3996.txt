Stood up Again, Screw online dating.
I (F24)have been stood up the 4th time in like, 30 days. I don't understand why this happening. These guys are LITERALLY scheduling dates, confirming on the day of, and then just not showing up at the place they chose at the time they suggested! I would respect them more if they said the day before, "i'm not into you, i dont want to go" then them letting me do my hair, which takes 4 hours to do because I am black and I have very long hair, doing my makeup, which takes an hour, choosing an outfit, shaving my legs, driving to your suggested location, and then finding out that you aren't coming. Like, this dude unmatched my profile when i asked what his ETA was after i was there for 1/2 an hour waiting!!!

Better yet, dont even ask me on a date! Dont confirm a place and time, dont play with me as a person! Dont make me waste my hair products, makeup, gas, money, energy, time, and self-confidence. 

I have so much anxiety when i date because at this point, its a 50/50 chance that they will even show up. i'm so done at this point. LA is the worst place to date. I'm done. It's not worth it at this point.
