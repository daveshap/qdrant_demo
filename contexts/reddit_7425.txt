To those who used tablets to take down “handwritten notes”, what laptop/tablet did you use and did it help?
Background info: I’m going to grad school this fall to study chemistry. I’m considering getting a tablet or laptop where I can digitally “hand write” my notes (I hope that makes sense). In previous chem classes I used regular paper, however, I’m horrible at being organized. Any info or advice is much appreciated. Thanks!
