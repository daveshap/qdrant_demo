Laptop not coming back from sleep after lid close I'm using Ubuntu 16.04 LTS on an ROG Strix GL553. I have a problem when I close the laptop lid. The computer goes to sleep but when I open it back again it gets stuck on a black screen.I belive there's something wrong with the Nvidia Geforce GTX 1050 drivers. I'm not sure how can I solve this, installing nvidia-current driver makes computer stuck on login.Edit: I tried suspending the laptop manually and same thing happens, screen remains black.
