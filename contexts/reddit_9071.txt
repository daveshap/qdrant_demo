What could a Vice President theoretically do in their capacity as "President of the Senate?"
[Article I Section 3](http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_transcript.html) of the US Constitution provides that:

>The Vice President of the United States shall be President of the Senate, but shall have no Vote, unless they be equally divided.

I have been doing some research but so far can't find a good answer as to what the extent of the powers of the "President of the Senate" are.  [This page](http://www.senate.gov/reference/Index/Vice_President.htm) notes Senate Rules 1 and 23, but they don't seem to say much other than what to do about the chair in the VP's absence, and that the VP is allowed on the Senate floor.

If a Vice President decided to use their powers to the maximums extent, what could they do?  Could for instance Joe Biden call a vote on the pending nomination of [Merrick Garland?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrick_Garland)
