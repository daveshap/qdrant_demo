A word that means \"small gift\"? I'm looking for a single word that means \"little gift\":<blockquote>  Sorry I couldn't buy you anything, but here's a _____ of ten dollars to spend.</blockquote>As for the context, it should be like one you'd see in letters between close friends i.e. informal and the word shouldn't be too long.
