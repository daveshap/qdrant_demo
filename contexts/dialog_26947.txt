CHRISTINE: See you around.
NICHOLAS: Where are you going?
CHRISTINE: Home.
NICHOLAS: How do you know that's the way?
CHRISTINE: Where'd you all go? Motherfucking frat boys. You better hide. Is your life so pathetic that this is something you're willing to pay for?
NICHOLAS: It was a gift... from my brother.
CHRISTINE: How thoughtful. The gift of inconvenience.
