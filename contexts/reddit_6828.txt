Do companies have any expenses when their workers are furloughed? CA
Stupid question

But I was wondering if a company in CA is furloughing, let's say, 30 employees. No insurance/benefits. No work, No salary. What are the expenses that may incur from this? 

My company just laid off most of us after 3 months of furlough. They are bringing some people back and they told me that they are still planning on bring everyone back (BS?) but unfortunately at this time they don't enough money due to lost work/clients (covid). Then why just not keep us "furloughed" on "unpaid leave of absence" indefinitely then?
