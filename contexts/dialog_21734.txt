SPARROW: I'd know him anywhere.
IGOR: Don't lose sight of him. This is the most important thing in my life.
RALPH: I wouldn't feel too disappointed at the slimness of your audience tonight, Mr. Igor. The weather was against you, and the people are tired and getting over their celebration and preparing to go to work tomorrow.
IGOR: Quite so. Quite so. And you, my little friend, my little Marie Antoinette. It is kind of you to be present.
CHARLOTTE: But I think these things are beautiful.
IGOR: They are. My boy, I think you are right. Everyone is tired out today and now that we have seen my doors open in a new country, I am beginning to realize that I am a little tired myself. You can call that fellow in from the front. I think we'll close for the night.
