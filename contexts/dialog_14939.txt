AMANDA: He's with a man named Ben Hildebrand.
BILLY: Who's that?
PAUL: Her new boyfriend.
AMANDA: A friend. We were vacationing. Eric wanted to see the island and the dinosaurs, so Ben found a guy who would take them parasailing. They never came back.
PAUL: We called everyone, did everything we could. Because of all the controversy over this island, no one will step in. Costa Rica says it's a no-fly zone, it's their own damn fault. Guys at the U.S Embassy -- our U.S. Embassy -- said we should accept the inevitable." You believe that?"
