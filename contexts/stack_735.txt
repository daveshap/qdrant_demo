network traffic monitor over time I am running an ubuntu server 16 and are looking to use an application that runs as a daemon collecting network traffic stats over time (day/week/month) and displays it in some form.I should be able to breakdown the traffic by either subnet/IP or protocolntop (opensource version) hasn't been updated since 2012 and using it seem to have a few bugs.vnstat is the closes i have found but it dosent let me break down the traffic by IP/protocolthanksalexis
