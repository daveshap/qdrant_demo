If you ghost after sex you’re the worst kind of person
So I got ghosted this week and I’m honestly a little in shock. Just wanted to vent. We went out 6 times and had a couple sleepovers. The last couple times I saw him we had sex. He kept saying he wanted to see me again, I was really sweet and fun, blah blah. Now he’s vanished. I’m not going to text him again (already sent 3 unanswered texts in the last week and a half)  because I respect myself enough to know that he’s never going to answer and he’s not worth it. 

Just wanted to vent here. 

Seriously, if you’ve been intimate with someone, you can be honest and just let them down easy. Just say you’re not interested. That’s it. Just so they don’t have to wait by their phone and second guess and worry. 

I’ve been reading a lot of posts here from people who’ve been ghosted and it helped a bit. Just wanted to share my feelings here because I have nowhere else to let them out really. 

At the end of the day, I’m glad I put myself out there. I’ve been single for most of my adult life but I’d like to be braver and try to find someone to share life with. So at least I tried.
