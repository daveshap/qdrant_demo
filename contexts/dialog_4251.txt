DULANEY: I think we're getting a little off the subject here.
REBECCA: I thought the subject was sex?
DULANEY: As it pertains to you -- not me. Did you always know you had different... tastes?
REBECCA: Yes.
DULANEY: How?
REBECCA: I don't know if it's something I can explain to you.
DULANEY: Why not?
REBECCA: Because -- it's beyond intellect. It's emotion. It's passion. It has to be experienced -- it can't be imagined.
DULANEY: Try.
REBECCA: When I was growing up we had a strawberry patch in our backyard. So did this family down the road. I used to sneak in their yard and steal their strawberries. It wasn't easy. The stone walls were high and I'd scrape my knees as I climbed over. On the other side were wild rose bushes. The thorns would dig into my legs and cut my thighs as I lowered myself down.
DULANEY: If you had what you wanted at home why did you sneak into their yard?
REBECCA: Because -- somehow the fruit always tasted that much sweeter because of the pain it took to get to it.
MICHAEL: Albert's got the stomach flu.
SHARON: That's too bad.
MICHAEL: No, it's not. Now I get to pitch.
SHARON: Michael, you shouldn't be happy when someone else isn't feeling well.
MICHAEL: Not even if they're a dork?
SHARON: Not even if they're a dork. You should go by and see how he's feeling.
