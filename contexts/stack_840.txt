CR2 Photos compressing from Windows 7 to Ubuntu Right now I'm going to completely move to Linux. I need to move my photos from a laptop running Windows 7 to a PC running Ubuntu. I tried sending it via Google Drive (single file, ZIP archive, RAR archive) and via USB. In all four cases Image Viewer on Ubuntu says the image is 1288x1936 (RMB >> Properties), but Picasa Photo Viewer in Windows says the image is 2602x3906. Also, the size of the file remains the same on both machines: 9,287,417 bytes. The photos are in the 'CR2' format (Canon Raw Image). Why do images get compressed?Sending a JPEG image via Google Drive resulted in the same image size. Maybe Picasa Photo Viewer or Ubuntu's Image Viewer treats the 'CR2' format wrong?Converting this photo from CR2 to JPEG in Windows (through a website) makes it 1288x1936, just as Linux says.
