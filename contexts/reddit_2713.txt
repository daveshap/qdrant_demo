Old employer is stuffing Glassdoor, making fake LinkedIn profiles, but is becoming an influencer. Can I do anything?
Very long story short, I worked for this company for 6 months about 4 years ago. They're a dumpster fire, so I left as soon as I found another opportunity in the same city. While I never felt unsafe, it's a genuinely horrible place to work, so I did my best to let people know that – left a truthful one-star review on Glassdoor and steered anyone who asked clear of them.

They unsuccessfully tried to have my GD review removed (and a coworker got a legal notice of defamation about her review, lol) so I occasionally check up on their page to make sure it's still up. The profile is just brimming with fake, vague, five-star reviews. You know the type. I report them all and reached out to Glassdoor's customer service team to let them know, but I doubt they care.

This week, I got a LinkedIn connection request and vague intro direct message from someone purporting to work at this company with a very obviously fake profile picture. Reverse image search confirmed it was a stock photo. I called them out in response to the message (just pasted the tineye link) and they immediately changed the picture but didn't respond. I then image-searched their new photo and found it again (they had reversed the stolen image this time). I reported the profile to LinkedIn as fake and hopefully it gets taken down.

But as the title says, the company and specifically its CEO has a growing thought-leadership presence in legit publications. He's a contributor to Inc and Forbes, which all link back to the company website, and the company has been featured in a local tech pub.

I know I probably should just let it go, but this place is awful (crazy turnover, missed paychecks, abuse management) and I don't want other young professionals to get hoodwinked and have a bad experience. I'm well beyond the point of ever needing these connections again, so I'm not worried about "burning a bridge." I have some pull with the local publication that featured them, but I don't want to make myself look bad by blowing something up that doesn't really affect me.

As far as I know, they're not breaking the law (just the LI & GD terms of service), but this is super shady spammer-like behavior and I want them to get called out for it, or at least stop doing it. Is reaching out to the local press that featured them or the national publications that feature him a terrible idea? Is a public Twitter thread with screenshots tagging the company just blowing this up unnecessarily and will reflect poorly on me? Anything else could I do?
