DOUG: Don't give me this Kat, I'm doing it for you and your country.
KATKA: What? You are crazy!
DOUG: Look, just hear me out, okay?
CHRIS: Okay, we're listening. But I'm with Katka on this one.
DOUG: Well, it's like I said, there's a ton of empty buildings around here and most of them were apparently given back to the city, so they're not private.... Now, Jahn here is an drama student at the University. He knows of a building that they were going to turn into a puppet theatre - they even began work on it, until they ran out of money.
CHRIS: Puppet theatre, don't you need something a little bigger?
DOUG: It's big, right Jahn?
JAHN: Yeah, for sure.
DOUG: And, since it's only two streets away, I suggest we go take a look. Now!
KATKA: Doug I can't, I've got to be at work by eight. You promised to take me home.
DOUG: Look Kat it'll only take ten minutes. Without Jahn I might never find it... We'll just have a quick look and then you and I'll hit a tram.
KATKA: I don't want to get in trouble.
DOUG: Don't worry it's okay!
