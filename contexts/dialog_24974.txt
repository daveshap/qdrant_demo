BARNES: I don't want you talking to Jerry.
NORMAN: But sir, I think it's imperative. I think the messages, the animals we've seen, what killed Edmunds, the reading you got earlier -- I think they're all related.
TED: Jerry isn't hostile, Norman. He said earlier -- we were his friends --
NORMAN: Of course he did. He's been isloated for 400 years. He wants someone to talk to. Look, you put a human being in isolation for four days, they can become neurotic, sometimes psychotic. We're talking about 400 years here. An alien that shows emotional responses. I think we need to address him, before he reacts further.
BARNES: You think he killed Edmunds?
NORMAN: Yes, I do. Whatever's out there, I think is his response to us refusing to talk to him earlier.
BARNES: Bullshit. What's out there isn't alien. It's an animal.
NORMAN: Maybe so. But I think we need to ask Jerry about it.
BARNES: No. I think we should shut down the communication lines inside the habitat. He might be listening now.
