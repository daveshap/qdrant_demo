Mediation using PROCESS - Add covariates to model with Y only, or both M and Y? I am conducting a mediation analysis (model 4) in SPSS using the PROCESS macro by Hayes.I have cross-sectional survey data and want to test the following relation:Childhood adversity (X) -> Current loneliness (M) -> Current psychosis (Y)I want to add three covariates to the analysis: age/sex/depressed feelings. PROCESS gives me the option to add these covariates in models of both M and Y, and Y only (and M only, but not interested in that). I know for sure that I want to add these covariates to the model with Y, as I think that the covariates might influence the relation between X and Y, and between M and Y. However, I could also think of some reasons why they might influence the relation between X and M \u2013 I am not necessarily interested in this relation, but they could influence the estimate of the mediation effect.My question is: should I only add my covariates to the model with Y as this was my a priori reason to include the covariates, or should I also add them to the model with M as there might be some relationship there which would be good to control for? (I.e., are there good statistical reasons to include covariates to both M and Y models, rather than Y only?)
