Can I help Nat and Meghyn find hearty truffles? While traveling around Hyrule, I\u2019ve repeatedly run into two sisters Nat and Meghyn. After rescuing them from Bokoblins, they say that they\u2019re searching for hearty truffles.<blockquote>  Nat: Remember, Meghyn, nobody goes home until we find those hearty truffles!    Meghyn: *sigh* She\u2019s right. The sooner we find those truffles, the sooner this will all be over with.</blockquote>Their dialogue makes it seem like there should be some way to help them search, but I haven\u2019t been able to find any way to do this.Is there any way to help Nat and Meghyn find hearty truffles?
