KARL: Different ones. One's the Bible. One of 'ems a book on Christmas. One of 'ems how to be a carpenter.
FRANK: How come you're carryin' them around with you.
KARL: Ain't got nowhere to set 'em down.
FRANK: Don't you live somewhere?
KARL: I did live there in the state hospital.
FRANK: Why'd you live there?
KARL: I killed some folks quite awhile back. They said I wadn't right in the head and they put me in there in the nervous hospital instead of puttin' me in jail.
FRANK: They let you out?
KARL: Yeah.
FRANK: How come?
KARL: They told me I was well. They had to turn me loose.
FRANK: Are you well?
KARL: I reckon I feel all right.
FRANK: You don't seem like you'd kill nobody.
