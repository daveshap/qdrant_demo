GEORGE: Pop!
POTTER: Have you put any real pressure on those people of yours to pay those mortgages?
BAILEY: Times are bad, Mr. Potter. A lot of these people are out of work.
POTTER: Then foreclose!
BAILEY: I can't do that. These families have children.
GEORGE: Pop!
POTTER: They're not my children.
BAILEY: But they're somebody's children.
POTTER: Are you running a business or a charity ward?
BAILEY: Well, all right . . .
BAILEY: Mr. Potter, what makes you such a hard-skulled character? You have no family –– no children. You can't begin to spend all the money you've got.
POTTER: So I suppose I should give it to miserable failures like you and that idiot brother of yours to spend for me.
