BEN: In the basement over at Janey and Jim's. With that weirdo Mikey. Not even a TV on. And they're on the floor and he's got his trousers down though thank goodness she's still dressed. Well, I really let him have it! ... and Wendy came home peacefully... Hey, should I dress for the Halford's now, or - give me your -
ELENA: Up to you. I'd like to go early and leave pretty soon after that.
BEN: I get you loud and clear... hey, you look nice.
ELENA: So what were you doing in the Williams' basement anyway?
BEN: Oh, just dropping off a coffee cup. Jim left it, last time he was over. It was on the dash of the car. You were, you know, reading, thought I'd just catch some air. Let's eat.
ELENA: Oh right. The mustache coffee cup. The one that was sitting on the dash.
BEN: Yeah, that one.
ELENA: That one.
PAUL: See you.
BEN: Stay out of trouble.
