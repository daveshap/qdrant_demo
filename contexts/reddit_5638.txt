How do I find a job in the current situation (from being currently unemployed)?
I was made redundant from my last job in the UK in March (administrative job).

Currently unemployed and have savings up until December.

How are things looking in terms of me finding a job? I have a business degree (first class) and some experience in transactional finance.

Do you think I will be able to find a job until October-November? I am registered with a lot of recruiters, but almost no e-mails/calls or interviews lined up since covid hit.

Can you provide some advice as I am quite worried and stressed.

Thanks.
