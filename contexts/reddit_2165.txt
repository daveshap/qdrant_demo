How are you using online communities while you apply for college?
Hi! I'm Pia, a reporter for WIRED. I was in touch with the mods earlier, and I'm working on a story about how prospective students are using online communities (Reddit, Insta, TikTok, etc.) as a resource while they apply for college. What impact does it have on your sense of preparedness? Or on your mental/emotional health?
