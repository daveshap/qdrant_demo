HARRY: Come on to bed, you don't have to brush your teeth.
HELEN: I'll just be a second. So what happened tonight at the office?
HARRY: I couldn't believe it. I go back to get this report I need, right, and the phone is ringing, so like a bonehead I answer it--
HARRY: It's the big client in Japan, and it's the middle of the morning there and their whole system is crashed... this guy's having a meltdown--
HELEN: What'd you do, honey?
HARRY: Well I pull out the manual on their setup, which is the new 680 server...
HARRY: ...and I'm troubleshooting it with them over the phone... talking to a translator, right, who's getting half of it wrong... it was unbelievable... really wild.
HELEN: It sounds wild. So now you're a big hero, right? For fixing their system.
HARRY: Uh huh.
HELEN: My husband the hero.
