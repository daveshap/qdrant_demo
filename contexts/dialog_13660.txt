CAPT. BLUMBURTT: Jones isn't in his room. Miss Scott -- my troops are leaving at dawn if you want us to escort you to Delhi --
WILLIE: No -- you can't go! Something awful's happened. They've got Short Round and I think Indy's been --
CAPT. BLUMBURTT: What?
WILLIE: We found a tunnel that leads to a temple below the palace! Please, come with me, I'll show you!

CAPT. BLUMBURTT: Who?
WILLIE: It's some kind of cult! And they've got the sacred stones that Indy was searching for.
CHATTAR LAL: I sense the fumes of opium in all this. Perhaps Miss Scott picked up the habit in Shanghai.
WILLIE: What're you talking about -- I'm not a dope fiend! I saw it! I'll show you!
