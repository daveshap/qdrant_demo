THE KID: He's gonna die, ain't he?
NED: Maybe.
THE KID: Well, suppose he does?
NED: We'll bury him.
THE KID: That ain't what I mean.
NED: You mean, am I gonna help you kill them cowboys?
THE KID: I can't spot 'em myself but you could. That red-haired one, you could spot a half-mile off, I bet.
NED: An' if I spot 'em?
THE KID: I'll ride up close an' shoot 'em!
NED: Just like that?
THE KID: I told you I'm a damn killer. I done it before. I'm more killer than him.
NED: Yeah?
THE KID: Hell, yeah.
MUNNY: I thought... you was an angel.
DELILAH: You ain't dead.
MUNNY: Some big guy beat the shit out of me. I guess I must look a lot like you, huh?
DELILAH: You don't look nothin' like me, mister.
MUNNY: I didn't mean no offense. I guess you're the one them cowboys cut up. Ned an' The Kid, my partners, are they... ?
DELILAH: They went out scouting when they saw your fever broke.
MUNNY: Scouting?
DELILAH: On the Bar T... looking for... them.
MUNNY: Oh. How long I been here?
DELILAH: Three days. Are you hungry?
MUNNY: Three days? I must be.
MUNNY: I thought I was gone. See them birds? Most times I wouldn't even notice them birds much. But I'm noticin' 'em real good 'cause I thought I was dead.
DELILAH: I brought your hat. You... left it down at Greely's.
MUNNY: That big guy lookin' for me?
