I went on a date this weekend. Holy shit I dodged a bullet
We matched on Tinder and we were having fun, nice talk. We exchanged numbers and set up a coffee on friday.

When we met we started talking about stuff, I've noticed she didn't have much of a filter for topics to talk about. At the first date she:

* Said her friend commited suicide. Gave details of what happened
* Is on heavy meds for depression and meds for sleep
* Talks about her exes, asks about mine and talks about other Tinder dates she had
* Emphasizes how she can't date fat dudes (ironically her weight isn't ideal either)
* Has expressed prejudice against LGBT

&#x200B;

She asked to go out again in saturday and I gave the benefit of the doubt. Confirmed everything on the next day

On sunday I was definitely not ready to talk with her. Thank the gods (airhorns) I found out she blocked me.
