Can coefficients of variation be compared if the samples differ in size? I have to do a study for trying a sanitary product that has an acceptance criterion for the %CV repeatability and %CV reproducibility of the measurands. The acceptance criterion of the performance of this product is based on %CV and the cut-off was obtained by doing a similar study (actually the same but with bigger sample size than the study that I am doing). So, could I use the same value of the acceptance criterion for my study to accept if the measurements fit?
