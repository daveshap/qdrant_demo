TRUMAN: I'm looking for my wife--Nurse Burbank. It's important.
NURSE: I'm afraid that's impossible--she's in pre-op.
TRUMAN: Sure. Okay. Fine. Can you pass on a message?
NURSE: I'll try.
TRUMAN: Tell her, tell her...I had to go to Fiji. I'll call her when I get there.
NURSE: When you get to Fiji?
TRUMAN: You got it.
NURSE: Fine. I'll tell her.
