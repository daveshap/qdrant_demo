IKE: Lawyers. I don't know, Ellie -- Firing me is going to be very tough on you. It's going to be hard to get over. There will be therapy bills for you.
ELLIE: I already made an appointment for later today.
IKE: See? You want custody of my job? ... Why not just consider my wrist slapped and call me when you feel I've served my time?
ELLIE: I'm sorry, Ike. This is permanent.
