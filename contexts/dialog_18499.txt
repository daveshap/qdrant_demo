MAC: What're you going to do?
BABE: I'm going to tell him the truth.
MAC: Tell him you're Babe Bennett? Tell him you've been making a stooge out of him?
BABE: I'm having lunch with him today. He expects an answer. It's going to be pretty.
MAC: You're crazy! You can't do that!
BABE: He'll probably kick me right down the stairs. I only hope he does.
MAC: I'll put you on another job. You need never see him again, eh?
BABE: That's the rub.
MAC: Oh, as bad as that, huh?
BABE: Telling him is the long shot - I'm going to take it.
