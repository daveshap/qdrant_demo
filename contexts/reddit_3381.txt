Knowing you're someone's first priority is such a rush
My boyfriend just quit his old job as it was very bad for him emotionally, so he took the first good job he could find. It's a good job but the only downfall is that he's going to be away a LOT. He'll basically only be back on weekends.

 He starts on Monday, but he just made it very clear that if I don't like it or if I feel it's affecting our relationship to tell him and he will quit immediately.

He said the last thing be wants to do is fuck up what we have, and just his willingness really hit different. Sorry, just wanted to gush

Edited to add:
I see the points people are making, and I should have been more clear. First I guess I shouldn't have said "immediately", because he said he's going to try it out for at least a month, and I wouldn't even try to ask him to quit without trying it out for a good while first.

Also, this was never going to be a career for him anyway. It's doing roofing just for the summer with a friend of his. Just until he figures out what he would like to do more permanently. It was the quickest job he could start to get out of his other one.

One commenter put it pretty well I think, that my boyfriend and I prioritize more time together than some people. It's not for everyone but I'm glad it works for both of us. And obviously not everyone even has that opportunity, like the nurse in the comments who hasn't been able to see her boyfriend since covid started, due to him having an immunocompromised son. Major respect from me, that sounds really tough.
