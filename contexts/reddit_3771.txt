The regret feeling for trying
You ever have that feeling of seeing someone either in person or on your social media and wondering why you ever thought you had a chance? Even though you had people in your corner hyping you up and building your confidence because they want to see you happy. So they encourage you to talk to the person you find attractive and you're interested in, But you know that in your mind you don't have chance with them in hell with them. Then you do it and you end up getting rejected by them or they aren't into you like you are into them. Then a few days, week, months go by and you come across them in person or on social media and you sit and wonder why did I think I even had a chance in hell with them?
