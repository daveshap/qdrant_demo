Quitting without new job lined up - next steps
I am 28 studied industrial.engineering and been working in supply chain and logistics for the last 4-5 years. I was at company A for 4 years adter graduating and then moved to company B in October 2019. I was hating company B because of the day to day, very tedious, manual and was dreading waking up every morning. I decided to quit wirhout a job lined up in January because i couldnt take it any more. It was making me sick.

Now i am really lost on what to do. I am looking to apply to a full time masters program starting in August. But what should i do until then? If i find a good full time job i would feel really bad for quitting so soon. But what if i dont get into the program? I am looking at contract jobs but its not easy. Also looking to do an internship abroad for a few months. Please help on what i should do. I really need advice.
