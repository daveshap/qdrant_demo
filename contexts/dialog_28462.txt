SANCHEZ: What if it doesn't come?
MACREADY: It'll come. It needs us. We're the only thing left to imitate... Give me a hand.
MACREADY: You and Nauls got to block off the west side bunks, the mess hall and the kitchen.
NAULS: You crazy? He might be inside already?
MACREADY: Chance we got to take. We got to force him to come down the east side to the door we got rigged.
SANCHEZ: He might just wait us out.
MACREADY: I'm going to blow the generator when you get back. He'll have to come for us -- or freeze.
