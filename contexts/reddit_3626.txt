I told my crush I like him with the paper crane
This is an update for my [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/dsrqhl/im_gonna_tell_my_crush_i_like_him_this_friday/) about how I wanted to tell my crush that I like him today. I did it!!!

I gave him the paper crane, and I told him to open it after school.

After school, I waited many hours, and got no text from him. I was already feeling like a failure, and was heavily preparing myself for rejection.

But then... HE TEXTED ME!! AND HE SAID HE LIKES ME TOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!

Im legit so happy!! We were both kinda freaking out, and he said he is gonna write a letter back to me on a paper crane and give it to me irl!! And he also asked me to the movies on Sunday!!!! Iâ€™m so hyped!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

Side note: Thank you to everyone who supported me, and hyped me up!! It really helped me get the courage that I needed to finally tell him! I honestly had thoughts of bailing out, but I remembered everyone cheering me on, and stuck with my plan :)
