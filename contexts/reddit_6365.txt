LPT: when writing a resume... focus on the job you want, not the jobs you've had
Having a "work history" section is a must, but when it comes time to rewrite your resume, make sure it's slanted toward getting the job you want, not focusing too much on the jobs you've had. 

This is especially true if you've switched careers: focus on your expertise with the new industry rather than using valuable space for a job no longer relevant. The way [resumes are written](https://www.vmsolu.com/resume-writing-resolutions-for-job-seekers-in-2015/) has changed a lot in recent years, and this is just one of the things potential employers have come to expect.
