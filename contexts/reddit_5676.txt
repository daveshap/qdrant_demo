How TF do I get hired !?
I’ve had a park job for two years I’m a 18 M so I would assume employers would be interested in hiring a younger person with work experience would be the case. I recently got promoted at my job but that doesn’t start until the summer, can someone possibly aim where I can apply to/ critique my resume by any chance. I’d really appreciate the help.
Ps. I’ve applied to Costco/ retailers/ grocery stores, no dice : /
