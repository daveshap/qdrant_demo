Number of states in Reinforcement Learning I'm having trouble understanding the concept of states in RL. The Policy maps an action to a state. I'm thinking about the state as clearly defined situation. E.g. in connect four assuming a 8x8 grid, there would be $2^{64}$ possible states. (Actually $3^{64}$ since every field can be red yellow or empty...) Finding a policy for all of those states sure works, but is definitely not RL. This would be memorizing.How can one imagine a state e.g. in the case of connect four?More complex RL applications like Mari/o even use CNN. They are observing the game to know which state they're in. Since in this CNN pooling isn't used there will be something like 800x800 RGB pixels... My idea of a state clearly defined by its pixel has definitely to be wrong.
