GERSTENKORN: Tentative my foot -- a month before this your old father-in-law came very privately and scratched at my door.
PREYSING: Scratched -- We did not take the initiative.
GERSTENKORN: Of course you took the initiative.
ZINNOWITZ: Good morning, gentlemen -- I see the conference is already underway.
PREYSING: Oh, here you are, Justice Zinnowitz -- I'm at cross-purposes with these gentlemen -- will you clear up the situation?
ZINNOWITZ: But the situation is perfectly clear, If you will allow me --
GERSTENKORN: How clear is Manchester?
ZINNOWITZ: Foggy -- frightfully foggy, always, I'm told. Have you said anything about Manchester, Mr. Preysing?
PREYSING: I can make no statement about Manchester at this time.
ZINNOWITZ: Well -- gentlemen.
ZINNOWITZ: Since, on the eleventh of June of this year -- when the first negotiations for a merger...
GERSTENKORN: Thank God we're beginning at the beginning.
ZINNOWITZ: As you remember it -- when you approached us...
GERSTENKORN: We did not approach you.
PREYSING: I know you did -- I said you did --
GERSTENKORN: And I said we didn't.
