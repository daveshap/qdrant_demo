On a first date I think both parties should share expenses
I’m actually old fashioned I do like to pay for what I do with a lady on a date but after recently going on a date with someone who I thought was vibing with me pretty well and we had done a few things we started with frozen yogurt and then coffee at Starbucks and had some drinks and an appetizer after. She did say she wanted to pay for something so we went and bought a bottle of liquor to have a few shots together that she paid for but directly after she says she has to leave never opening the bottle. I still had a great time and texted her later Saying as much and her response was ..glad you had a good time . I’m pretty sure their won’t be a second date and looking back she didn’t even offer the tip at the restaurant. I now think if the woman decides early on the date that she isn’t seeing that spark and she decided to continue with the date anyway she should at least legit offer to go half or at least chip in. Dates aren’t cheap anymore and every failed date you pay for gives you less opportunity to spend time and money on someone that’s actually interested. What are your thoughts on this ?
