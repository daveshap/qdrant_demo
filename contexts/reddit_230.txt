I'm so scared and I'd love some advice
I'm 13 (I turn 14 very soon though) and last year I had gotten signed up for this thing after my mum found my suicide note the day after I was planning on committing suicide. Two weeks ago my mum and I had to go to counselling which ended in them signing me up for something called CAMHS. This Wednesday I have to go again I'm so scared of whats going to happen. I don't want people to know why I was at the hospital or why I'm going again and since one of my closet friends is my cousin I'm afraid of her finding out and telling people. I'm scared incase I get treated differently, when I moved to that school I made a friend who was really nice but I started to realise she treats me like a kid, she says "Okay?" at the end of everything as if I won't understand and other stuff like that. I don't want anyone else to treat me like that. I also don't know whats going to happen in these visits nobody really tells me, I'm always scared incase they bring out medication or lock me in a room somewhere. I'm a very emotional and sensitive person, I'm always scared of something bad happening and it terrifies me every time my mum or literally anyone questions my mental health. I had a small panic attack when I got there and since I really don't know what is happening this time I'm scared of a big one happening.  


My school attendance is almost at 30% which is really really bad, I struggle to force myself up every morning to the point where it doesn't even happen I just lay there trying to convince myself its worth it. I really don't want to have to repeat a year, I don't know what I'll do if I have to.   


I'd appreciate advice on on the hospital thing and how to get myself up every morning, it'd help a lot.  


Thanks!
