Need help if I should go into student affairs
HI,  I'm majoring in MIS which is in the business school. I was wanting to change it up and go into advising because I'm not really interested in the business field. I feel the most comfortable when I'm in a university environment.  I'm just afraid to go into this field because of the pay. Would you still recommend it? Is there growth in the industry?
