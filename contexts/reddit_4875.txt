I don't know if I am depressed or just have a severe burnout
For about 7 years now I feel terrible, but it comes and goes. I have periods where I just want to stop existing and after some time I have the feeling that everything is fine. 
I spoke to my doctor about it (a few days ago for the first time) and she believes that its just a burnout. I have panick attacks when school, work or life in general gets overwhelming, so I get where she is coming from.
But does that mean that this feeling that I just want to stop existing and that life is pointless comes from a burnout? She asked if I ever wanted to hurt myself and I said no because I've seen firsthand what it can do to people (family/friends). She said that it probably isn't a depression because of that. Is the feeling of a burnout similar to a depression? How do you know the difference?
