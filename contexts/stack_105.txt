Cannot paste images from clipboard to Facebook in Safari unlike Google Chrome I have problems pasting images from clipboard to Facebook in Safari.I have recently uninstalled Google Chrome and started using Safari since Chrome uses tons of energy and memory. I liked it but I had to reinstall Chrome since the Safari clipboard is very limited.For example in Google Chrome I can copy and paste easily pictures from Tumblr to Facebook, using shortcuts or looking for the option with the Magic Mouse. In Safari this does not work in any possible way, I tried \"cmd + v\" to paste an image I have copied before which I expect should work, but does not. Yes, in Safari I cannot paste any image!I have macOS High Sierra 10.13.3 MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2017, Two Thunderbolt 3 ports)Do I need to reinstall Chrome in order to be able to paste images in Facebook?
