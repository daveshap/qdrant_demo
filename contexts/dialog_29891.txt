LELAND: Did you get this from your lover?
SARAH: They don't call them lovers in high school, Leland.
LELAND: Bobby didn't give you this?
SARAH: How would you know if Bobby didn't give her that?
LELAND: Did Bobby give you that or is there someone new?
SARAH: Leland leave her alone... She doesn't like that. Stop it.
LELAND: How do you know what she doesn't like?
SARAH: Oh, Leland, sit down and eat you dinner.
LELAND: Oh, I'll sit down, but none of us are going to start eating till Laura goes and washes her hands.
