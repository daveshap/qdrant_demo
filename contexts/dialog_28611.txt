KENNY: I don't like what's happening.
THE PRESIDENT: In the morning I'm taking charge of the blockade from the situation room. McNamara'll set up shop in the flag plot at the Pentagon, keep an eye on things there.
KENNY: All right. 'Cause you get armed boarders climbing into Soviet ships, shots being fired across bows...
THE PRESIDENT: I know, I know...
KENNY: What about these low-level flights? They're starting in what? An hour? Do you realize what you're letting yourself in for?
THE PRESIDENT: We need those flights. We have to know when those missiles become operational, because when they do, we need to destroy them.
KENNY: Fair enough. But Castro's on alert and we're flying attack planes over their sites, on the deck. There's no way for them to know they're carrying cameras, not bombs. They're going to be shot at, plain and simple.
KENNY: I'm your political advisor, and I'm giving you political analysis here. This is a setup. The Chiefs want to go in. It's the only way they can redeem themselves for the Bay of Pigs. They have to go in, and they have to do it right. It's that simple.
THE PRESIDENT: I'm gonna protect those pilots.
