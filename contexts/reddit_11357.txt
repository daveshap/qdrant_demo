Friend committed suicide, hurts so much
It's been over 8 months now. Already. I can't believe it. 
He was a close friend to me, I didn't know him very long but he got so close and important to me like no one ever did before and after in this short time. In a few months we talked so much, I knew how he felt, and I knew he was up to it. He tried it once and I only found out afterwards. We talked a lot after that and he somehow found hope again and wanted to change something in his life, so we looked for a therapist and he got other medication. Some months followed where we spent a lot of time and were texting everyday for hours. After some time he started to draw back, talked less. I knew what this meant and was so scared. But I always got me a promise, like 'see you tomorrow/next week". We were texting in our group chat this evening, we planned to go to a movie at the end of the week. after a while he wouldn't answer anymore but was online all night. I read through our whole chat history that night but didn't text him cause I thought he'd be already annoyed by me. Next day I heard, he's dead. 

It was a fucked up time back then, my boyfriend was his best friend also. He is not much of a talk about emotions person, so we had our problems while coping with that in different ways. Our friend was from another country and had no one here, so I cleaned his apartment and sent his stuff back home to his family. 
It's been some months now. Sometimes life is okay. Sometime (especially when I drink, like now) it's bad. I miss him so much. Everyday. All the other people/friends seem to go on. I feel strange when it still hits me so hard while the others don't cry or freak out about it. I have two other friends who fight with depression for years and are suicidal every now and then, too. I sometimes feel so helpless. I wish he was still here.
Sorry for the long text. Was somehow important to sum it all up.
