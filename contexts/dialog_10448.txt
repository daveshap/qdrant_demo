ARNOLD: What do you think, George, shall I resign? It's what they want.
WASHINGTON: Don't do anything rash, please, Benedict.
NATHANAEL GREENE: They're just disgusting, jealous, bottom-feeding swine. It's their nature.
WASHINGTON: You have a free tongue, Captain Hamilton.
WASHINGTON: The army needs you.
ARNOLD: The army can survive without me.
WASHINGTON: Then, I need you. We all do. Without your victory the men would have no hope at all.
ARNOLD: Someday, George, you may need to act for the good of the people no matter what Congress thinks that is. It may come down to us, or them someday. You or them. Cicero was right: was is 'a time when the laws are silent'.
WASHINGTON: I hope I never have to believe that.
ARNOLD: Christ, George, Joseph Reed's been writing letters back to Congress attacking you. Your own aide!
