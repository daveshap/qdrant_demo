Applied for a job, didn't make second interview, job got re-posted.
Hey all,

I am a sales and distribution rep with 10 years experience.  I work in the wholesale world for stores, bakeries, restaurants, that sort of thing.  Recently, I applied for a job as a sales development specialist at a tech company.   I got to the first interview, and then a week later, I received an email saying I didn't make the cut.  I emailed back and asked why, and they said they liked everything about me, but we require candidates to have experience in strategic selling that includes working towards monthly targets and goals and developing campaigns.    


They provide on site training, and continued training through out your career, and seems like this would be something they could train, if they felt I wasn't up to par.  The reason I am posting this, is because they re-posted the job yesterday, meaning they didn't find anyone.   So, should I write an email to try and convince them to give me a shot, or would that leave a sour note?     


I have a couple of friends who work for this company, and they said they do keep your resume on file, so I don't want to annoy them, and have my name blacklisted or scratched off of future opportunities.
