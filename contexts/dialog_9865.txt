FRANCES: I'll... take your word for it. So who are you, then?
HARRY: Harry York. I work for Martoni Kaminski, he's running for Congress here.
FRANCES: Oh yeah! I saw you in the newsreel!
HARRY: Yeah, well --
FRANCES: You know, my Dad's done some work for Kaminski...
HARRY: Now you're catchin' on. Don't wanna get your Daddy in hot water, do you?
FRANCES: Whattaya mean?
HARRY: Well... see the papers've got us pegged as pinkos, then you come along, the friendly neighborhood atheist --
FRANCES: But I'm not. The newspapers're --
HARRY: Right again. You're no more an atheist than my man's a Red, but what they're doin', see, they're addin' up their version of your ideas with their version of ours. Could look bad for your Daddy.
FRANCES: Yeah. Could look bad for you and Kaminski too, I guess.
HARRY: Sure don't talk like you're sixteen.
FRANCES: Well aren't you the smoothie. Now you're going to ask for my number, I suppose.
HARRY: I suppose not. Gotta ask you this, though: for all our sakes, you better keep your trap shut.
FRANCES: Well... I'll give it a try, Mr. York.
HARRY: Harry.
FRANCES: Harry.
