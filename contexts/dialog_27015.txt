NELL: Are you coming to confess?
MARROW: I wish I were. I wish I had done it, then I could confess and you'd be at peace. That great moral philosopher Frank Sinatra once said to someone he loved, I wish you had an enemy, so I could beat him up.
NELL: Let's say it wasn't you. Who did it?
MARROW: I don't know.
NELL: It was a stupid thing to do.
MARROW: It was.
NELL: Welcome Home.
MARROW: You'll never see it again. Mr. Dudley's taking care of it. I'm sorry, Nell. Can I show you something you'd like to see?
NELL: Sure.
