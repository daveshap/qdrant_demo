KIMBERLY: I was driving a white van. It must've gone out of control because it crashed into a lake and I drowned. It was...horrible.
CLEAR: You were there?
KIMBERLY: I can practically taste the water in my throat. And something else. The smell of flowers...
CLEAR: Then it wasn't just a sign. It was a premonition?
THOMAS: Remember the onramp? There was a pregnant woman in a white delivery van.
CLEAR: Holy shit. He said only new life can defeat death." If she gives birth to a baby that was never meant to be born
KIMBERLY: It throws the entire Death list out of whack. And a new list has to be rewritten from scratch. We all start over with a clean slate.
THOMAS: It sounds all well and good, but what if we're wrong?
CLEAR: Please, what else could it mean?
KIMBERLY: So if you give us the pregnant lady's number, we can warn her about the lake and she'll live long enough to have the baby.
CLEAR: So let's do it.
THOMAS: Shit, I don't have her number. She was never interviewed. She took off right after the accident.
KIMBERLY: How are we going to find her? There must be thousands of white vans in this state.
THOMAS: Hey, I'm a police officer, remember?
