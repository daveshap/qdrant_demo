ALICE: That doesn't look like very much clay.
WALTER: Oh it's enough...
ALICE: Are you nervous, Walter?
WALTER: N-no...
ALICE: Not even a little bit?
WALTER: I already told you I'm not.
ALICE: When's the last time you had a totally nude girl in your room...
WALTER: Um...
ALICE: Without a stitch of clothing on, sitting and facing you...
ALICE: A girl with a body like mine?
WALTER: You're breaking my concentration!
ALICE: Walter can I ask you something?
WALTER: What!
ALICE: Are you a virgin?
