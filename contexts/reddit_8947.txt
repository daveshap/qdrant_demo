Is there currently enough federal funding for state election security grants? What are the arguments for and against eliminating new funding for election security grants to states?
Today, the House voted [against an amendment](https://apnews.com/6580a9fdf5364b46be462d73ed0c5422)  to increase funding for state election security grants by 182-232, while the overall spending bill was approved 217-199.

Democrats [seemed to be outraged](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/07/19/dems-erupt-into-usa-chant-on-house-floor-after-hoyer-gives-fiery-anti-putin-speech.html) that the amendment was not passed:

> House Democrats on Thursday erupted into the chants on the floor of the House of Representatives after House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, D-Md., delivered a fiery speech condemning Russian President Vladimir Putin for election meddling and accusing Republicans of not doing enough to ensure security of future elections.

> “Surely, we can rise above pandering to party and Putin to act on behalf of our freedom and our security,” Hoyer said to applause from Democrats, over the bangs of the gavel as the House was called to order by the speaker.

Republicans argue that the [program has enough funding,](http://thehill.com/homenews/house/397805-house-gop-refuse-to-boost-funding-for-election-security) and claim the outrage is political theater:

> House Rules Committee Chairman Pete Sessions (R-Texas) fired back by calling Democratic opposition a “shrewd political shenanigan that has no merit to it,” the Post reported.

> States still have money left over from the $380 million in appropriations given to the election assistance grants earlier this year, Sessions said.

> Sessions also argued that the programs do not need additional funding ahead of the November midterms, because Congress has spent $3.5 billion on the grants over the years.
