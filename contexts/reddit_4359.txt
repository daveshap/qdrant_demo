Hey, you, go get in the shower (reasons and actual quick tips in the post)
Go shower.    

It takes 10 to 15 seconds to get your sadness-laden legs to drag you to the bathroom.  

Turn the water on medium-high to your comfort level. Treat yo self and don't turn on the fan: give yourself a warm bathroom today to towel off in.  

It will take another 8 to 10 seconds to get your clothes off. Step in the warm shower.  

As the warm water hits you it feels **amazing.**
  

 I spent the last three days on on couch. I have no one to tell me not to. I couldn't get up;  I was heavier than before.   

Today I got in the shower and put on a pair of pants that don't stay up by worn-down elastic.  

I'm still depressed. But I'm depressed in a nicer shirt and somehow I feel just a little bit better. Don't get me wrong, I'll be staying home.  

 This isn't meant to be an inspiring life affirming post.   

Just one small thing to make everything be ok for one moment, and a little less terrible the next.  

So take care.
