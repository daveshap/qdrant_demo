KING: Ellie? Oh, she's no responsibility.
ANDREWS: No? Say, listen—I've devoted a whole lifetime trying to tame that wildcat. Toughest job I ever tackled. Ever hear of J.P. Clarkson? Biggest man in the country, isn't he? Well, I tamed him . Got him eating out of the palm of my hand. I've browbeaten financiers, statesmen, foreign ministers—some of the most powerful people in the world—but I've never been able to do a thing with her. She's been too much for me. I'm glad you think it's easy. Now listen—if you'll do what I tell you, perhaps I might develop a little respect for you. You never can tell.
KING: What would you like to have me do?
ANDREWS: Sock her!
