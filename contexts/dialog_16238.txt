WILLY: Chill, Winston, it's me and Charlie can see it's me, so what's the problem?
WINSTON: The problem is, Willy, that Charlie and yourself are not the quickest of cats in the alley at the best of times, so just do as I say and keep the fucking cage locked.
WINSTON: What are you carrying, Willy?
WILLY: Er, fertilizer.
WINSTON: You went out six hours ago to buy a money counter and you come back carrying two bags of fertilizer. Alarm bells are ringing, Willy.
WILLY: We need fertilizer, Winston.
WINSTON: We also need a fucking money counter, William! We have to get the money out by Thursday and I'll be buggered if I am counting it . . . and if you have to get your sodding fertilizer, couldn't you be a little more subtle?
WILLY: What do you mean?
WINSTON: I mean we grow copious amounts of ganja, and you don't look like your average hort-er-fucking-culturalist, that's what I mean, Willy.
TOM: What the hell are you doing here?
EDDY: Why, what's up?
TOM: Er, let me guess, my foot in your arse? A game of cards and Hatchet Harry. You're supposed to be getting some rest, boy!
