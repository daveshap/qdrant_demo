LT THOMPSON: Who? Who did that?
MR LANTZ: Krueger.
LT THOMPSON: Krueger?
MR LANTZ: Had to've done it. No one else was in there.
LT THOMPSON: How you know that?
MR LANTZ: Cause I thought Glen was gonna sneak out to see your lunatic daughter, that's why. So I locked him in his room! Sorry. Anyways, the door was still locked when we heard the screams.
MR LANTZ: Maybe god's punishing us all...
LT THOMPSON: Keep your head -- this is a fucking flesh and blood killer we're talking about.
MR LANTZ: Like Rod Lane?
