Taking a Pay Cut for Coronavirus... Should I Do It?
Update: thank you everyone for all of your sage advice! I’ve decided to take the cut and start working on my network and resume. I’m very grateful to even have a job during this time and need to remember that as I go forward! 

I make $52k a year in a big city and just barely get by as I help out my mom financially. Half of my small company was laid off in the past few weeks and now I've been asked to join the rest of the company in taking a 10% pay cut for an entire year (April 1, 2020 - April 1 2021). In return, they're giving me 5 extra vacation days, which hurts because how could I afford a vacation on less pay?

I've spoken with my friend in HR there and know for a fact that everyone else makes at least $20k more than she and I do, so asking the only 2 people who make less money to also take a cut makes me so angry. Granted, I'm extremely fortunate to have a job still in this climate. 

I've been told I can keep my current pay and forgo my extra vacation days but the people I've spoken to have said I shouldn't expect to keep my job if I do that. I'm terrified of losing my job but I can't imagine spending an entire year making so little money. Any advice on how you would handle this?
