KEOUGH: Around here. Yeah.
HECTOR: If he's eaten in the area, he shouldn't be far away. Crocs hang around the food source.
KELLY: But they're nighttime hunters, Hector, he'd probably be on land now anyway.
HECTOR: 'Cept he wasn't before, was he? You know, when friends or family members say things, they tend not to register so sometimes it helps to hear it from a total stranger. You're fat.
KELLY: <u>Hector</u>.
JACK: What's that?
KEOUGH: White perch.
JACK: Are they feeding?
KEOUGH: Doesn't <u>look</u> like it.
JACK: They look like they're jumping.
