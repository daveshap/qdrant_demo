Encrypt external HDD without erasing data on High Sierra? I'm running Filevault on my internal hard drive, but I realized that I never encrypted my external drive. Currently it's running Mac OS Extended (Journaled) and I'm not seeing any encrypt options anywhere (right click in Finder, disk utility, etc...). How can I encrypt this drive in place without having to erase all the data first? I could restore the data from a Time Machine backup but that sounds very tedious and time consuming. If there is a faster way I'd like to attempt that first.
