HEATHER: No, Rex is not going to die. Julie, you know where the sewing stuff is, don't you?
JULIE: Sure. We'll do an operation, Doctor Dylan and Doctor Julie. We'll fix him good as new.
CHASE: Heather?
HEATHER: Chase. Hi...
CHASE: What's up?
HEATHER: Chase, you'd better come home.
CHASE: Heather, I'm stuck here. Neither Chuck or Terry came in today. I can't get away!
HEATHER: Chase, it's Dylan!
