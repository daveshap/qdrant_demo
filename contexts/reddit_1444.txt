Fuck cancer man
I don’t know why I’m posting this on here because it will do absolutely nothing, but there is a sense of release, man I don’t know. 

Today we found out that a woman who basically raised me has kidney cancer. She was a part of my family since before I was even born, I grew up with her she is practically my second mother. 

This is too much man. Things are happening in the world that feel like a punch in the face. 

If you’re reading this you’re probably going through something and don’t want to read about another person but somehow I am here writing this... 

Have a good day, cause it’s not that good here!
