TERRY: River Street? I thought we was going to the Garden.
CHARLEY: I've got to cover a bet there on the way over. Anyway, it gives us a chance to talk.
TERRY: Nothing ever stops you from talking, Charley.
CHARLEY: The grapevine says you picked up a subpoena.
TERRY: That's right... .
CHARLEY: Of course, the boys know you too well to mark you down for a cheese-eater.
TERRY: Mm—hmm.
CHARLEY: You know, the boys are getting rather interested in your future.
TERRY: Mm—hmmm.
CHARLEY: They feel you've been sort of left out of things, Terry. They think it's time you had a few little things going for you on the docks.
TERRY: A steady job and a few bucks extra, that's all I wanted.

CHARLEY: You don't mean you're thinking of testifying against—
TERRY: I don't know— I don't know! I tell you I ain't made up my mind yet. That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
CHARLEY: Listen, Terry, these piers we handle through the locals— you know what they're worth to us?
TERRY: I know. I know.
CHARLEY: Well, then, you know Cousin Johnny isn't going to jeopardize a setup like that for one rubber-lipped—
TERRY: Don't say that!
CHARLEY: —ex-tanker who's walking on his heels— ?
TERRY: Don't say that!
CHARLEY: What the hell!!!
TERRY: I could have been better!
CHARLEY: The point is— there isn't much time, kid.
TERRY: I tell you, Charley, I haven't made up my mind!
CHARLEY: Make up your mind, kid, I beg you, before we get to four thirty-seven River... .
TERRY: Four thirty-seven— that isn't where Gerry G...?
