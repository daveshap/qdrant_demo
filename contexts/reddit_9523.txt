Let me tell you what I did to start my road to recovery of being dirt ass poor...I quit my pointless vices.
Smoking being the biggest but, also I cut out the huge amounts of soda I was drinking as well.  I added up how much I spent on these items a day and times it by 365. Holy crap 3.5k a year on cigs, $500 a year on fountain sodas.  This was about 20% of my take home pay.
