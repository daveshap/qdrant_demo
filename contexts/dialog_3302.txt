JUNO: Yes... or no? Do you want the Deetzes out or in?
ADAM: <u>Out</u>.
BARBARA: What about Betelgeuse?
JUNO: Forget him. He'll remain with his whores until someone calls him. You need to worry about people like <u>Otho</u>. There are a lot of phony trance mediums. They usually can't make the formulas work, but if Otho stumbles on the right words in that handbook... he could hurt you. As in -- <u>exorcism</u>.
