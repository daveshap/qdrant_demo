People are WAY too obsessed with getting texts back immediately
I feel like almost every question on here is some form of "They don't text everyday, are they not interested?" "I haven't gotten a message in 2 days, am I being ghosted?" or "They haven't texted me back yet, what does it mean?"  


I feel like this sub in general is supportive and gives good insight, but am I the only person who doesn't need to text everyday with someone I just met/started seeing? I often see posts of people freaking out over 2 or 3 days of not talking. Most of the time I don't think this is a big deal. I feel like people forget that others have lives outside of their dating lives.


EDIT: 

The general consensus seems to be that it really depends on the context. And yeah, I agree. But I feel like I’ve seen a lot of posts on this sub where OP is concerned/paranoid simply because of breaks greater than a day in between texting when otherwise the person seemed interested and everything else was fine.

I also want to emphasize that my post isn’t directed at people in serious relationships. (A few comments talked about how they would text their SO everyday and I definitely understand that.)
