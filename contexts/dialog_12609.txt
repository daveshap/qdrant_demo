LAURA: What?
ROB: What, what?
LAURA: Did you say something?
ROB: No. So. Is it working out with Ian?
LAURA: Rob. Don't be childish.
ROB: Why is that childish? Your living with the guy! I'm just asking how it's going.
LAURA: I am not living with him. I've just been staying with him for a few days until I work out what I'm doing. Look, this has nothing to do with anyone else. You know that, don't you? I left because we weren't exactly getting along, and we weren't talking about it. And I suddenly realized that I like my job, and I like what my life is could be turning into, and that I'm getting to a point where I want to get my shit together and I can't really see that ever happening with you, and yeah, yeah, I sort of get interested in someone else, and that went further than it should have, so it seemed like a good time to go. But I have no idea what will happen with Ian in the long run. Probably nothing.
ROB: Well then why don't you quit it while you seem to not be ahead?
