Do you randomly get an awkward thought and cringe physically?
Hi I don’t know if I’m alone but  randomly while doing work i would get awkward thoughts or memory and I’ll cringe? 
like noticeably cringe to the degree that if I was reading something, I would read it louder. Or I would say random things out load because of all the awkward energy. 

Please tell me that I’m not alone

TLD;R I get physical reactions to thoughts

Edit: We got a nameee for ittt!!! It is called “cringe attacks” and you can find it on google! thanks u/Thy_Introvert

Edit 2: it’s most likely a form of intrusive thoughts. We all have stupid crazy thoughts, that’s ok and very normal. What may indicate a problem is when the existence of this thought begins to persist, bother you, affect your mood, your life or relationship with people. Having the though is no problem but your *reaction* to the though might indicate something bigger like OCD. Please stay safe and consult a professional if you think it indicates a deeper issue❤️
