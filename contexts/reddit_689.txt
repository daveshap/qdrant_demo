Life right now isn't great
The series of events that lead to muy current situation of discontent with muy life begins in September of last year, I went abroad to Canada for 11th grade, in the time I was in Canada (which was on itself a rather unpleasant time) everything changed back home.

Before I left for Canada my best friend stopped being friends with me after 13 years of friendship because "my family and I were a bunch of ungrateful people for what he had done for me all these years" and other stuff he said influenced to him deciding to stop being my friend. So after this I only had 3 friends left (I am not very sociable person and tend to be very shy with people) which are good friends, but the thing is that in my year in Canada they started to hang out with people I don't get with. So by the time I came back from that horrendous place they had over 20 friends all of which I don't know or dislike.

So 12 grade starts and slowly but surely I start to realise that I honestly have no friends for my 3 are always with this other people, I don't speak to anyone in my classroom and if I do is just because they spoke to me just to laugh at what I say or do. Plus the girl I like who likes and thinks literally exactly the same way I do, thinks I'm kind of a creep because I don't talk that much. 

All of this plus bad grades and pressure at home to decide what I want to study in college is destroying me.
