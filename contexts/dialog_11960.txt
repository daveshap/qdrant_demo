HANNAH: I don't know about that. Oh, no, I just, see, I-I've been very, very lucky. W-when I had the kids, I decided to stop working and just, you know, devote myself to having the family, and I've been very, very happy but...I've always secretly hoped that maybe some little gem would come along and tempt me back on the stage...
EVAN: Yeah.
HANNAH: ...just for a second. So, now I got that out of my system and I can go back to the thing that makes me happiest.
