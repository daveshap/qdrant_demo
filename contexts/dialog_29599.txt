SARK: Yes, MCP.
MCP: I've got a little challenge for you, Sark -- a new recruit. He's a tough case, but I want him treated in the usual manner. Train him for the games... let him hope for a while... and blow him away.
SARK: You've got it. I've been hopin' you'd send me somebody with a little moxie ... what kind of program is he?
MCP: He's not any kind of program, Sark. He's a User.
SARK: A User?
MCP: That's right. He pushed me...in the other world. Somebody pushes me, I push back. So I brought him down here ... What's the matter, Sark? You look nervous.
SARK: Well, I -- it's just -- I don't know, a User, I mean... Users wrote us. A User even wrote you...
MCP: Now get this straight, pal -- no one User wrote me. I'm worth a couple million of their man-years! I'm bigger than all those little wimps put together! Humans they can't even keen their social order in one piece
SARK: But-what if I can't...?
MCP: You rather take your chances with me? Want me to slow down your power cycles for you?
SARK: Wait...I need that...
MCP: Then pull yourself together. Get this clown trained. I want him in the Games until he dies playing.
SARK: Yes...acknowledge, Master Control...
MCP: End of line.
