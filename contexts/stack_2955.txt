Metric of the Universe As some of you know, there is a fundamental flat space-time metric that describes our universe without any energy or matter in it. Correct me if I am wrong, but this metric and existance of the limiting speed of signal propagation which is not dependent of the observer are the same thing. Or? Could we understand one as a consequence of the other? So, could we say that the constant $c$ is a consequence of the metric? And, could there be some other, fundamentally different flat spacetime metric which allowes other forms of motion? Eg, greater speeds, in a nutshell, a different causality? What do you think, is there some more fundamental physical reality which determines the metric?
