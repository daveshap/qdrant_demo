Loneliness
Im a 14m and have dealt with depression (on medication for that now) and have been on winter break for the past week and a half. I'm kindof introverted but have been slowly coming out of my shell so to speak for the past year or so and this has made me very dependent on my friends but anyway, I rarely see my friends outside of school and am feeling very lonely and that is leading more and more to depression. Are there any recommendations on what I should do or if. I should ask for more anti-depressants or just try to wait it out until school rolls back around
