Synchronize two MySQL databases between two servers Is there any way to connect a database on two servers inside a trigger?I have 2 databases on 2 servers.  The first server is the primary, and the second server is the secondary.  I want to sync both databases with each other. I've tried using a trigger but it looks like that can only update data in the same server, however I want to sync the data from server one to server two.Is there any way to do that?MySQL version :- 5.0.12 (10.1.36-MariaDB)Purpose of replication: read-write and read data spritely (for performance)
