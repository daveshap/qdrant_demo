TERRY: I— I'd like to, Edie, but— —there's nothin' I can do. Edie feels subdued, ashamed at breaking down. She rises, and in a low voice says—
EDIE: All right, all right.. I shouldn't 've asked you.
TERRY: You haven't finished your beer.
EDIE: I don't want it. But why don't you stay and finish your drink.
TERRY: I got my whole life to drink.
TERRY: You're not sore at me?
EDIE: What for?
TERRY: For— not being any help?
