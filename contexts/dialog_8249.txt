HANA: You've got a mustache.
STUART: A bit of one.
HANA: I was looking forward to this evening.
STUART: I had a hotel room.
HANA: I thought that was for when we were very very old?
STUART: I'm feeling old.
CARAVAGGIO: Supper. Hana calls after him.
HANA: Where've you been?
CARAVAGGIO: Rabbit hunting.
HANA: I could help you. I could get you off that.
CARAVAGGIO: Can you cook the rabbit or will you try and bring that back to life?
HANA: It's a week. We didn't know where you were - or if you coming back, or -
CARAVAGGIO: You should be happy. What were you going to do for him when it ran out? He pulls out more phials from his jacket.
HANA: What do you do? What are you doing here?
CARAVAGGIO: Some gave me a dress. You know what's great? What I'm learning? You win a war and you not only gain the miles you get the moral ground. Everywhere I go, we're in the right. I like that.
THE PATIENT: Something smells so rich. My stomach is heaving -
HANA: He came back, he says he caught a rabbit. I'm cooking it.
THE PATIENT: That's a different dress.
HANA: He keeps asking me questions about you. Do you know him? Do you recognize him?
THE PATIENT: Do I recognize him? I recognize what he is. I like him. He's Canadian. He can read Italian. He can catch rabbits.
