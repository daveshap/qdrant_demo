Urban fantasy book about magic appearing in the modern world This is an urban fantasy book in which magic suddenly returns to the modern world. The setting is in a large city (maybe New York) and has a very disaster-genre feel. The protagonist's boss is slowly turning into a dragon. This would have been in the late 90s, I think.
