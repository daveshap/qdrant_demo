DAVID: At the church... You were following me weren't you?
ELIJAH: Technically no. I gambled that you would attend the church service. I just waited for you.
DAVID: What's this about? This is obviously some scam. Is this where you tell me one of those pictures is like an investment?
ELIJAH: You've misunderstood.
DAVID: I see guys like you all the time in my work. You find someone you think is emotionally vulnerable and you tell them a fantastic story, utterly convincing... and somewhere in there, you slip it in... 'I just need your credit card number','I just need a small down payment.'
