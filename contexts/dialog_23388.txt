MARY: Dr. Judd?
JUDD: Yes, Miss Gibson. I've come to take you to your sister.
JUDD: Don't be so amazed. It's a very ordinary matter. I'm Jacqueline's physician... Mr. Ward told me you were in town and Jacqueline has sent me to bring you to her.
MARY: You know where she is?
JUDD: If I didn't know where she was, could I take you to her? Get your hat and coat. We haven't much time.
JUDD: It's my cloven hoof. It trips me up sometimes.
MARY: Cloven hoof?
JUDD: Yes. You know the devil and all his minions are marked that way.
