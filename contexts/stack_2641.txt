Relation between scale factor and standard meridians/parallels Let's use transverse Mercator with a custom zone, with central meridian 30, the zone is 3 degrees wide at the equator, with a scale factor k=1, it means that the cylinder touching the spheroid along the central meridian. However, with scale factor k=0.9996, the cylinder is secant of the spheroid at two meridians, one at right of Central Meridian and the other at left. How to find these meridians for a given scale factor k at equator?
