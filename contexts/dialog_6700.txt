ZAMMITO: What's this?
VINNY: A car.
ZAMMITO: Oh really? Thanks. I thought it was a sewing machine. What the hell is it doing here?
VINNY: It's for you.
ZAMMITO: For me? What am I going to do with a piece of shit like this?
VINNY: I don't know. Sell it. It's gotta be worth something. Someone gave it to me. C'mon Frankie, I'm trying to make good here.
ZAMMITO: Okay. Okay.
VINNY: I'll get you the papers tomorrow.
