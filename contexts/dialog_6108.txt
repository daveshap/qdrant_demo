DANTE: You don't want to know.
RANDAL: You called Caitlin again?
DANTE: She called me.
RANDAL: Did you tell Veronica?
DANTE: One fight a day with Veronica is about all I can stomach, thanks.
RANDAL: What do you two fight about?
DANTE: I guess it's not really fighting. She just wants me to leave here, go back to school, get some direction.
RANDAL: I'll bet the most frequent topic of arguments is Caitlin Bree.
DANTE: You win.
RANDAL: I'm going to offer you some advice, my friend: let the past be the past. Forget Caitlin Bree. You've been with Veronica for how long now?
DANTE: Seven months.
RANDAL: Chick's nuts about you. How long did you date Caitlin?
DANTE: Five years.
RANDAL: Chick only made you nuts. She cheated on you how many times?
DANTE: Eight and a half.
RANDAL: Eight and a half?
DANTE: Party at John K's-senior year. I get blitzed and pass out in his bedroom. Caitlin comes in and dives all over me.
RANDAL: That's cheating?
DANTE: In the middle of it, she calls me Brad.
RANDAL: She called you Brad?
DANTE: She called me Brad.
RANDAL: That's not cheating. People say crazy shit during sex. One time, I called this girl Mom.""
DANTE: I hit the lights and she freaks. Turns out she thought I was Brad Michaelson.
RANDAL: What do you mean?
DANTE: She was supposed to meet Brad Michaelson in a bedroom. She picked the wrong one. She had no idea I was even at the party.
RANDAL: Oh, my God.
DANTE: Great story, isn't it?
RANDAL: That girl was vile to you.
DANTE: Interesting postscript to that story: Do you know who wound up going with Brad Michaelson in the other dark bedroom?
RANDAL: Your mother.
DANTE: Allan Harris.
RANDAL: Chess team Allan Harris?!
DANTE: The two moved to Idaho together after graduation. They raise sheep.
RANDAL: That's frightening.
DANTE: It takes different strokes to move the world.
RANDAL: In light of this lurid tale, I don't see how you could even romanticize your relationship with Caitlin-she broke your heart and inadvertently drove men to deviant lifestyles.
DANTE: Because there was a lot of good in our relationship.
RANDAL: Oh yeah.
DANTE: I'm serious. Aside from the cheating, we were a great couple. That's what high school's all about-algebra, bad lunch, and infidelity.
RANDAL: You think things would be any different now?
DANTE: They are. When she calls me now, she's a different person-she's frightened and vulnerable. She's about to finish college and enter the real world. That's got to be scary for anyone.
RANDAL: Oh shit, I've got to place an order.
DANTE: I'm talking to myself here.
RANDAL: No, no, I'm listening. She's leaving college, and...?
DANTE: ...and she's looking to me for support. And I think that this is leading our relationship to a new level.
RANDAL: What about Veronica?
DANTE: I think the arguments Veronica and I are having are some kind of manifestation of a subconscious desire to break away from her so that I can pursue the possibility of a more meaningful relationship with Caitlin.
RANDAL: Caitlin's on the same wave-length?
DANTE: I think it's safe to say yes.
RANDAL: Then I think all four of you had better sit down and talk it over.
DANTE: All four?
RANDAL: You, Veronica, Caitlin... ...and Caitlin's fianc√©.
