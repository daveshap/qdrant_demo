ELLIE: You know, if you really wanted to scare the kid you could've just pulled a gun on him.
GRANT: Yeah, I know, you know...kids. You want to have one of those?
ELLIE: Well, not one of those, well yeah, a possibly one at some point could be a good thing. What's so wrong with kids?
GRANT: Oh, Ellie, look. They're noisy, they're messy, they're sticky, they're expensive.
ELLIE: Cheap, cheap, cheap.
GRANT: They smell.
ELLIE: Oh my god, they do not! They don't smell.
GRANT: They do smell. Some of them smell.. babies smell.
ELLIE: Alright, the one on the airplane had an accident, but usually babies don't smell.
GRANT: They know very little about the Jurassic Period they know less about the Cretaceous.
ELLIE: The what?
GRANT: The Cretaceous.
ELLIE: Anything else, you old fossil?
GRANT: Yeah, plenty. Some of them can't walk!
ELLIE: It frustrates me so much that I love you, that I need to strangle you right now!
