QUINCY: What do you want?
ZEKE: Came by to check on you.
QUINCY: After five years.
ZEKE: Don't remember that being my fault. Seems like you divorced me same time as your mom.
QUINCY: Look, I'm busy.
ZEKE: I can see that. I know things look pretty bleak right now, but you can't get down on yourself.
QUINCY: I stopped taking your advice a long time ago, or did you forget?
ZEKE: No.
QUINCY: Good.
ZEKE: Quincy. I know you left school early to throw your middle finger up at me.
QUINCY: And now I'm paying for it, right? That what this is about? I told you so?""
ZEKE: You want me to fuck off?
QUINCY: Yeah.
ZEKE: Fine, I'll fuck off, but not til I say something.
