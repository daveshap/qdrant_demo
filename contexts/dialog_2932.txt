GUS: So Nilsen had a report on her -- so what. You don't know what the hell was in it?
NICK: Catherine told me what was in it.
GUS: If she's telling you the truth.
NICK: Don't you get it, Gus? If Beth killed Johnny Boz to frame Catherine -- she wouldn't want anyone to know what happened at Berkeley. It gives her the motive to kill Nilsen.
GUS: How did she know Nilsen knew about it -- if it happened?
NICK: He was I.A. He probably asked her about it.
GUS: She'd have to be nuttier than a twenty-pound Christmas fruitcake. She's not the one who hangs out with multiple murderers -- your girlfriend is.
NICK: She's a writer -- it's part of what she does.
GUS: Goddamn writers -- all they do is use up trees and ruin people's eyes. There's gotta be somebody at Berkeley who knows what the hell happened.
NICK: I know what happened. Catherine told me what happened.
GUS: You got goddamn tweety-birds flutterin' around your head, that's what you got. You think you're gonna fuck like minks, raise rugrats, and live happily ever after? Oh, man.
NICK: How'd you get in here?
CATHERINE: I decided to give you one more chance. I missed you.
NICK: You didn't not see me long enough to miss me.
CATHERINE: Did you miss me?
NICK: No.
CATHERINE: Come over here and tell me no.
