CRABTREE: Naturally you have copies.
GRADY: I have an alternate version of the first chapter.
CRABTREE: You'll be all right then. Look at Carlyle, when he lost his luggage.
GRADY: That was MacCaulay.
CRABTREE: Or Hemingway, when Hadley lost all those stories.
GRADY: He was never able to reproduce them.
CRABTREE: Bad examples. Look, Tripp, I don't want to depreciate the loss here, but perhaps -- in a sense -- this -- is for the best.
GRADY: Kind of a sign, you're saying.
CRABTREE: In a sense.
GRADY: I don't think so. In my experience, signs are usually a lot more subtle.
VERNON: Let me get this straight. All that paper that went into the river. That was the only copy?
GRADY: 'Fraid so.
VERNON: And you're saying it's some kind of sign? What the fuck's the matter with you?
