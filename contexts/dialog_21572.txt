SHERIFF: Norman? Sheriff Chambers. Been just fine, thanks. Listen, we got some worries here. Did you have a man stop out there tonight... Well, this one wouldn't be a customer, anyway. A private detective, name of...
MRS. CHAMBERS: Arbogast.
SHERIFF: Arbogast. And after he left? No, it's okay, Norman. How's it been going out there? Well, I think you oughta unload that place and open up closer in to the action, a smaller place, you know... but...
LILA: Please!
SHERIFF: Sorry I got you up, boy. Go back to sleep. Yeah, be glad to. Said to give you his regards.
SAM: Was that all?
SHERIFF: This detective was out there and Norman told him about the girl and the detective thanked him and went away.
