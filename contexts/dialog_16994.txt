MAN IN THE IRON MASK: This place... I once lived in a country house. I had guardians -- an old man and woman. And tutors. But no friends. Then when I was twelve, they came and took me to the prison.
ATHOS: Who came?
MAN IN THE IRON MASK: A man in black. I never saw his face. He took me to the cell. A blacksmith came and they put me into the mask. For days I shouted, What have I done? Why do you do this to me?" But no one heard
ATHOS: And you never knew why?
