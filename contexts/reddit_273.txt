I feel trapped by my mom
I feel trapped under my mother. I'm almost 19 and about to graduate high school and go to college. Shes never let me have a job and shes trying to force me to not get one in college. I want to go to Italy for college and shes trying to force me to go to university of texas at austin and move there with me. My mom has always made snide comments to me about how I live and how I'm not doing enough at school. If I try to call her out for these comments she either denies it or says I'm exaggerating or taking it out of context. 
It feels like my mom is trying to control my life.

Also, I have a college fund that my grandpa set up for me and after he died my name and my moms name was put on it. I'm really afraid that if I go against my mom and do what I want then she will use that against me. 
I dont know if I'm overexaggerating or just misunderstanding her.
