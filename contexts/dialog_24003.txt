MILTON: Mr. Sayer...
MAX: What do you want -- ?
MILTON: Mr. Sayer, did we pay the million bucks yet?
MAX: -- Cashier's check went out to our anonymous tipster this morning -- worth every penny too. Who says there's no place for checkbook journalism? We'll be running stills of this for months, then release the whole tape -- we'll get our money back -- maybe show it on an exclusive pay-per-view event. Do you realize what we have here? We have the only independent footage of Simone in existence.
MILTON: We used to.
