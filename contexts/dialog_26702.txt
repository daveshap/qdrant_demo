SUSAN: I'm sorry about Steve, not myself. I'm even sorry for my brother. To be so lonely, without one real friend in the world - to have to hang on to a worthless rag of a girl like me because she's his only real family -
SIDNEY: Come on now, chickie, why don't you go to bed...?
SUSAN: And I'm sorry for you, too, Sidney. You're going down with the ship.
SIDNEY: What ship?
