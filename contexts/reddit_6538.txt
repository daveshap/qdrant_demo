What companies or jobs are the most flexible for a part time schedule?
I am already employed full time but need to find a part time job that will supplement my income. I also have a son half the time so I need to find something that will be flexible.. I can work every Wednesday or Thursday night and every other weekend. I have experience in customer service and sales, I am personable and young but donâ€™t think I could get a job as a bartender or waitress without experience..
