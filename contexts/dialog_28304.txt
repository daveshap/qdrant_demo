TED: It must be great with a wife like that.
DOM: Each day is better than the next. Have you ever been, you know... in love with someone?
TED: Nah.
DOM: Never?
TED: Well once. Mary.
DOM: Mary again.
TED: Look, I admit it was brief, but it was definitely love. Crushes don't last twelve years.
DOM: Whatever happened to Mary?
TED: I told you, her family moved to Miami.
DOM: I mean since then.
TED: I don't know.
DOM: Well why don't you look her up?
TED: Yeah, right.
DOM: Why not?
TED: Because I guarantee she's married and has a couple kids. Girls like Mary don't stay single.
DOM: What if you're wrong? You just said she's the only girl you ever loved, what have you got to lose by calling her?
TED: I did try calling her. A few years ago. She wasn't listed.
DOM: So that was it? One bump in the road and you gave up?
TED: I also called Unsolved Mysteries.
DOM: You're kidding? What did they say?
TED: They told me they don't help out stalkers. Look, maybe they're right, it's been a long time.
DOM: I got it -- you hire a private eye, fly him out there, he follows her around a couple days, she'll never know a thing.
