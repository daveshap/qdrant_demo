Redstone to detect \"falling\" (self closing trapdoor) Is there a way to get a redstone signal when a player falls through a hole (right after he falls, not when he lands)?Background: I created a bubble elevator and want a trapdoor for the other way around. When you want to go down, you open the trapdoor and fall, but the trapdoor would have to be closed again immediately after. I know I could make this work with tripwire, but I lack the space for that at the moment. If there is a better solution, I would be very glad for help.
