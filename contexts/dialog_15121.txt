BILLER: Hello?
BRUCE'S VOICE: Ken, it's Bruce. Listen, we've got a nibble on the Pendleton financing.
BILLER: Really? How much?
BRUCE'S VOICE: Fifty.
BILLER: Fifty? We need seventy-five.
BRUCE'S VOICE: Ken, we've been through this...
BILLER: You tell them if they come up to seventy-five, I'll cut them in on the Crystal Lake package.
BRUCE'S VOICE: Don't tell me you're still thinking of buying Casa de Psycho...
BILLER: Hey, smart-ass, I'm up here right now in a... luxury alpine retreat, with a two million dollar view of the lake.
