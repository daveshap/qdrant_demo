FYI: Most of the "I started a job doing <insert trade/trucking job here> and now make <large amount of money>!" are misleading you.
I realize this is unlikely to be a popular post, because both /r/povertyfinance and /r/personalfinance seem to have a bit of an obsession with trades and trucking jobs. Since there have been [several](https://old.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/9qndmr/last_year_i_was_earning_the_minimum_wage_and_now/) of these [threads](https://old.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/9qf37o/i_just_wanted_to_let_you_guys_know_about_an/) posted here lately, all highly upvoted, I think its important people understand the reality.


But before doing that I'll just preface this by stating: I'm not saying there is anything wrong with trucking or skilled trade work. It pays OK, and the barrier to entry is low enough that it can be a good option for many people. The issue with this topic is the hysterically large sums of money that people seem to infer is "normal" for these types of jobs.

The **median annual wage** for  *heavy truck drivers* is $20.42/hour or $42k/year, for *electricians* it is $26.01/hour or $54k/year, and for *plumbers* $25.28/hour or $53k/year. Are those all good wages? In most of the country, yes. Will they get you out of poverty? Yes. But remember, those are **medians,** which means you could very likely make less than that.

Almost no one in the trades or driving trucks is making these large salary numbers that get tossed around here. I have no doubt the people posting are getting paid what they say in most cases - but they are the exception. It seems people are forgetting if you work enough hours in any job, you'll make a lot of money. Truckers making $90k a year aren't normally being paid that much on a per hour basis, they are just working 60 hour weeks most of the year. Work any job that allows that kind of overtime and you'll make good money. And of course there are cases of people in trades making $90k a year with little overtime. They tend to be *in unions* in *very high cost of living areas* (and their wages won't apply to 99% of people in the occupation). 

Finally, most of these jobs are **not** in some sort of "shortage." Trucker jobs, for example, are expected to grow about as fast as all occupations (according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics). Certain regions may have a temporary shortage, but it isn't national and it won't last long enough to drive up wages. Jobs involving trucking and trades are actually very cyclical. During an economic downturn, these jobs get hit worse than other occupations because they rely on commerce or construction activity.
