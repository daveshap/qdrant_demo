self teaching R, Python or SQL for better prospects
I recently graduated with a B.S. in Geography and have been looking for my first job in the resource management without much luck.   I have some background in GIS, and am working on linking a blog of some work to my maps and writing samples to my Linkedin profile.  I would like to expand my skill set to include some R, Python and or SQL to make myself more marketable and would also like to have this show up on my profile.  I am on a budget, so I am looking for something, free if possible, with the best outcome to be able link to my profile or otherwise prove and market competency.  I am also not sure about what level of competency would be required to be more appealing.  Is there something that works like Duo Lingo, that you can work on and port a competency to Linkedin?  Is this even effective in recruitment?  Any insights would be welcome.
