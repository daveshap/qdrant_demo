\"Second-order approaches\". What does this mean? I'm currently reading a scientific paper, in which the words \"second-order approaches\" are supposed to inform me about a certain solution to a problem. However, I don't have the slightest clue on what these words mean.English is not my mother tongue, so it may be something very obvious. I've never seen it before so I'm not sure what it implies.I'd be very happy to know what it means.
