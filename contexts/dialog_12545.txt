BERNIE: You got it? Four year scholarship to a top college, plus Medical School or Law School or whatever Joey wants; pay off the $2,500 to my attorney, plus pay her fee in full, plus my annual consulting fee...
BUBBER: And give a deposition to the jUdge.
BERNIE: Listen, John, you better double my attorney's fee. She's very inexperienced, but she done a great job for me. And give her your autograph. She thinks you're some kinda holy man.
BUBBER: On the deposition for the jUdge, Bernie... I mean there's no way I can promise anything. I can't tell him what we're up to...
BERNIE: You'll tell him I talked you out of jumping, right? Just keep me outta prison.
BUBBER: I... I'll do the best I can, Bernie.
BERNIE: That's good enough for me. You better take that letter" there and get rid of it."
