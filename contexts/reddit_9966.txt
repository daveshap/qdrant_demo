Counseling Student Affairs - college readiness & access
 

Hey everyone! I just completed my first year of graduate school in my counseling student affairs program. I am thinking about what I would like to do come second . I could see myself working with college students in academic advising, career development, academic support, or student retention; ultimately I would like to put academic advising /career development and college access & readiness together by aiding secondary students.  

My program is counseling based and I would like to continue to build on the basic counseling skills that I have gained. I have thought about second masters or some type of certification to further my counseling skills and/or work with high school students, but I am not sure. All perspectives welcome. Thanks!
