HELEN'S VOICE: Yes?
DICKSON: Helen, I'm going to Philadelphia, just as soon as the bank closes. Make all the arrangements, will you?
HELEN'S VOICE: Yes, sir.
DICKSON: What's the matter dear? What have I done now?
MRS. DICKSON: Nothing. Tom, I thought you were going out with me tonight.
DICKSON: Oh, I did have a date with you tonight, didn't I?
MRS. DICKSON: Yes.
DICKSON: I'm terribly sorry. I'd forgotten all about you. I'm so sorry, dear.
MRS. DICKSON: Now Tom, you simply cannot go to Philadelphia tonight. That's all there is to it.
DICKSON: But I have to go, dear. It's a very important banker's meeting.
MRS. DICKSON: I don't care whether it's important or not. You said you were going out with me, and if you hadn't promised so faithfully, I wouldn't have gone and planned the whole thing.
DICKSON: Listen, it isn't so terribly important. We can go to the theatre any time.
MRS. DICKSON: The theatre?
DICKSON: That's what it was you planned, wasn't it?
MRS. DICKSON: Yes, of course.
DICKSON: You can take some of the girls. You can take Mildred - or Gwynnâ€”
MRS. DICKSON: The girls! I don't suppose it ever occurred to you that I might go out and find myself an attractive young man . . .
DICKSON: Ho! Ho! Ho!
MRS. DICKSON: Ho, ho, ho, yourself! I wouldn't laugh if I were you. You may not suspect it, but I'm still attractive - to some.
DICKSON: Listen, don't go around being attractive to anyone but me . . .
MRS. DICKSON: Well . . .
DICKSON: Don't you forget that I'm still the head man around here too. Now we'll get the tickets changed for tomorrow night. You and I are going out together. How's that?
MRS. DICKSON: Tomorrow night?
