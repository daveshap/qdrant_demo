Shes cute and I wanna talk more but I don't know how to strike up a conversation
So I friended this girl on snap and shes kinda cute and I wanna talk more but I dont know how to strike up a conversation, any help?



Edit:send too many memes, she said I'm too clingy and unfriended me, I see this as an absolute win
