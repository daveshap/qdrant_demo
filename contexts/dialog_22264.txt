ROCKY: Some people are very shy by nature.
ADRIAN: ...I suppose.
ROCKY: I would say you're very shy by nature.
ADRIAN: ...I suppose.
ROCKY: Some people think bein' shy is a disease, but it don't bother me.
ADRIAN: It doesn't bother me either.
ROCKY: Then why did I bother bringin' it up? 'Cause I'm dumb, that's why... Y'know, I think we make a real sharp coupla coconuts -- I'm dumb an' you're shy.
ADRIAN: ...It is just hard for me to understand why anybody wants to be a fighter.
ROCKY: Ya gotta be a little soft to wanna be a pug... It's a racket where ya' almost guaranteed to end up a bum.
ADRIAN: I don't think you're a bum.
ROCKY: ...I'm at least half a bum. Yeah, fightin' is a crazy racket. The roughest part is the mornin' after.
ADRIAN: Morning after?
ROCKY: After a rough fight, ya' nothin' but a large wound. Sometimes I feel like callin' a taxi to drive me from my bed to the bathroom... Ya' eyes hurt, ya' ears hurt, ya' hair even hurts... But the thing I'm proud of is I been in over sixty fights an' never had a busted nose -- Bent an' twisted an' bitten but never broke... That's rare.
ADRIAN: Why do you do it if it hurts so bad?
ROCKY: ...Guess.
ADRIAN: 'Cause you can't sing or dance?
ROCKY: Would ya like a glass of water?
ADRIAN: ...No thanks.
ROCKY: Here's the guys I was tellin' ya about -- This is Cuff an' Link.
ADRIAN: I sold them to you.
ROCKY: ...Oh, yeah, I bought the whole kit -- Yeah, ya sold me the turtles, the bowl, an' the mountain -- I had to get rid of the mountain 'cause they kept fallin' off.
ADRIAN: Do you have a phone?
ROCKY: I had it pulled. People callin' all the time. Who needs it -- Who'd you wanna call?
ADRIAN: I wanna let my brother know where I am.
ROCKY: D'you really wanna call?
ADRIAN: Yes, I do.
ROCKY: You sure?
ADRIAN: Yes.
ROCKY: Why?
ADRIAN: I think he might be worried.
ROCKY: I'll call your brother.
