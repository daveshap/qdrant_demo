CARL: The police break up our meeting. Herr Rick! We escaped in the last moment.
RICK: Come up here a minute.
CARL: Yes, I come.
RICK: I want you to turn out the light in the rear entrance. It might attract the police.
CARL: But Sacha always puts out that light --
RICK: -- Tonight he forgot.
CARL: Yes, I come, I will do it.
RICK: I want you to take Miss Lund home.
CARL: Yes, sir.
