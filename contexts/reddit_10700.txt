Emergency: I'm A Suicidal Teen and my family is trying to end my life.
 

.I won't give much context, but I (14M) got into an extremely heated argument with my Dad over my academic future. I remained respectful, **but he started beating me** and he told me how I'm crazy for liking history and video games, and that I'm gonna suffer and die alone and that no one and nothing will ever love me. I started crying, a lot, and was going to kill myself, by jumping of our roof. However, my Dad grabbed me and started beating me, whilst telling me that I wasn't his son anymore. I ran upstairs to my room, and locked the door (we have a special lock that can't be opened and I used that). **Mom's not helping either, and she started beating me as well** because I ''upsetted her and God by wishing for suicide''

It's been a few hours now, **and I'm extremely suicidal and I will certainly take my life unless I get immediate help from someone. I** have no trusted friends or adults around, and I live in a shitty third world country that doesn't have a good police force (besides they'll sympathise with my parents), and no emergency helplines. My phone has no battery either (im typing om computer), so I have no helpline I can reach out to (I think).

Please anyone, someone, I need some support of any kind. A simple DM, or something else like a helpline. Please, I really don't wanna die, but I feel so useless.

Help me.

**Edit: I'm British, but I'm living in Pakistan, if that matters.**
