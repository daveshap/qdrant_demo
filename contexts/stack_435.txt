troubles with dual booting windows 10 and ubuntu 16.04 i am running Windows 10 and am trying to dual boot with Ubuntu 16.04.  I have followed everything correctly i made a boot-able USB and shrunk my partition and done everything else.  I can load into Ubuntu and install it but after installing it and restarting i cant load back into the account i made and have to go through the whole installation process again.
