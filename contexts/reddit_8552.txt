What measures have been proposed, and what measures have been enacted to prevent foreign interference in the 2020 US presidential election?
The overwhelming consensus position of the US Government is that Russia attempted to influence the 2016 presidential election. Quoting from the the [6 January 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3254239-Russia-Hacking-report.html) - an analytic assessment drafted and coordinated among The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and The National Security Agency (NSA) - (emphasis original):

> **Russian efforts to influence the 2016 US presidential election represent the most recent expression of Moscow’s longstanding desire to undermine the US-led liberal democratic order, but these activities demonstrated a significant escalation in directness, level of activity, and scope of effort compared to previous operations.**

> **We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election.  Russia’s goals were to undermine public faith in the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency.  We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump.**  We have high confidence in these judgments.

> * **We also assess Putin and the Russian Government aspired to help President-elect Trump’s election chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavorably to him. All three agencies agree with this judgment.**  CIA and FBI have high confidence in this judgment;NSA has moderate confidence.

The DOJ indicted [thirteen Russian nationals and three Russian companies for committing federal crimes while seeking to interfere in the United States political system, including the 2016 Presidential election](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/grand-jury-indicts-thirteen-russian-individuals-and-three-russian-companies-scheme-interfere).

The 2018 House Intelligence Committee Republican report and the 2018 House Intelligence Committee Democrat rebuttal agree that [Russia interfered in the 2016 election](https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/house-intelligence-committee-gop-releases-final-russia-report/2018/04/27/cfea31e2-4a20-11e8-9072-f6d4bc32f223_story.html).

The bipartisan Senate Select Committee on Intelligence found that [The Russian government directed extensive activity, beginning in at least 2014 and carrying into at least 2017, against U.S. election infrastructure' at the state and local level](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/6214170/Senate-Intel-Report-On-Election-Interference.pdf), and the headline recommendations included:

* Create Effective Deterrence
* Improve Information Gathering and Sharing on Threats
* Secure Election-Related Cyber Systems
* Take Steps to Secure the Vote Itself

Additionally, there is evidence that [other countries](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-interference-idUSKCN1OK2FS) - e.g., Iran, China - sought to influence voters in the U.S. 2018 mid-term elections

And as recently as *last week*, [Intelligence officials warned House lawmakers that Russia was interfering in the 2020 campaign](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/20/us/politics/russian-interference-trump-democrats.html).
