A reminder for myself and anyone else who needs it:
If they really want to be with you, they will:

• Reply to your text in a timely manner 

• Text you first/again if they don’t hear from you

• Take the effort to make plans to spend time with you

• Ask about your day/care how you’re doing 

I think sometimes we (myself included) make too many excuses for the actions of others. We all have busy days/different ways of communicating but let’s be real, it takes 1 minute to draft a text and less time than that to put effort into showing you care for someone. You deserve that effort
