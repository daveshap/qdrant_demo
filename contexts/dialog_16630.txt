PETER: Are you alright?
MAYA: Sometimes, when I feel weak, I have these...visions.
PETER: What do you mean?
MAYA: I see things. My worst fears. You need to know something, Peter. I was possessed once. Like Birdson. It took Father Lareaux six days to pull me out of it.
MAYA: I'm scared I'm slipping back.
PETER: We're going to do this.
MAYA: You have to say that.
PETER: That's true.
