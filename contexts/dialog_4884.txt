JENNIFER: This is very awkward.
JANE: Go ahead -- what?
JENNIFER: Ummm -- it's dumb dorm stuff but I see Tom around you a lot and this is such a small office and I'd like to see him outside of work, unless there's some reason for you to mind... in which case I just won't do anything.
JANE: God Almighty -- Whew. Do I mind? Why do I mind? I do mind. What a shock -- I don't have a right to... I don't think I like him. I know I don't respect him...So what am I talking about -- what am I saying to you?
JENNIFER: You're saying stay away from him.
JANE: I can't be.
