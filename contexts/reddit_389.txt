Feeling lonely every weekend.
Hi! so i’m just a normal teenage in a normal high school. But there’s one problem, I feel lonely. especially during weekends. mostly i don’t go out during weekends and just stay at home doing my homework or watching tv or series or any other stuff while trying to talk to my ‘friends’ on social media i guess? and i just noticed that it’s always that goes to my friends and try & start a discussion. But this time, i was like : okay let me test something out. I didn’t talk to any of my friends on social media (almost) i guess and i just wanted to see if they’re gonna send me a message or something and nope none of them did actually, i did sent a message like to 2 people and it’s about some urgent stuff but i was ignored lol also I’m in a small groupchat with my friends and when they were talking i just keep leaving messages on read so maybe they talk to me or ask me what’s wrong or why i’m not answering & talking, but that didn’t happen of course and i swear to god if it was another one than me then they will ask what’s wrong! 
So in conclusion : if i don’t try messaging my friends , it’s either they literally forget about me or they don’t even message me. And this weekend i spent almost the WHOLE weekend alone. the only people i spoke to are either my parents (not that much really like just the normal boring conversations) and some girl who i’m doing a project with and that’s literally it. 
Can i have and advice here?What do i do so i can feel less lonely.?
