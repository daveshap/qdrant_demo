Was George W. Bush really such a bad president?
[He gets a lot of hate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_image_of_George_W._Bush), especially for his two wars, but in the end Saddams dictatorship was horrible and the afghan war wasn't his. Furthermore, he was only one man and the fuckup that was Iraq should not be blamed on only one person. The housing bubble is complex but it's said to have originated from [Clinton's extending bank priviligies of bad loands](http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1877351_1877350_1877322,00.html), and then again few people really saw it coming. I'm not saying this is the truth, but that this is one perspective of his presidency.

I come from Sweden btw,  and his public image isn't exactly great here.
