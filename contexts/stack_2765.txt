Are component of vectors vector and can we divide them into components? We know that two vectors can sum up and make one vector. And dividing a vector into components is the opposite process of summing vectors. Then the components of vectors should also be vectors. Are they really vectors? If they aren't, why are they scalar?And if they are vectors, can we divide these components into more components?
