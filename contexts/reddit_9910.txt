Proposal for strategies to increase Retention/Graduation Assignment. Need help and input!
I am currently working on an assignment that answers a Call for Proposals on programs/initiatives to increase student retention from first year to second year students. There is also a proposal for increased graduation rates, but these programs must specifically focus on sophomores, juniors, and seniors. Many schools have sophomore focus programs that include advising sessions, adventure outreach, and events that hope to boost sophomore retention. I was planning on centering my proposal around this initiative. What are your thoughts on sophomore-focused programs? What are good examples of these programs working? Do you have other ideas for programs to boost retention and graduation rates? Thank you!
