FATHER: Jane -- For God's sake... Look, it's time for you to go to sleep.
JANE: I just have two more pen pals and then I'm done.
FATHER: You don't have to finish tonight.
JANE: Nooo. This way the rotation stays the same.
FATHER: Finish quickly. I don't want you getting obsessive about these things. Good night.
