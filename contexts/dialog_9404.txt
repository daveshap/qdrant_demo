SICKLY BROWNIE: Um, my allergist told me not to engage in physically demanding activities where ragweed or spores might be present, sir.
TROOP LEADER: Do you have a note to corroborate these claims?
SICKLY BROWNIE: Um, well...

TROOP LEADER: What did we say about lying?
SICKLY BROWNIE: I'm not lying.
TROOP LEADER: You know that no one likes a liar, right?
