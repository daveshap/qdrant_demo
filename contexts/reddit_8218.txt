What is the significance of President Trump's pardon of Arpaio, and have pardons been used similarly by previous presidents?
Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who'd recently been convicted of contempt of court, was pardoned by [POTUS](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/25/us/politics/joe-arpaio-trump-pardon-sheriff-arizona.html?mcubz=0). From the same article, Joe Arpaio is known to put aggressive efforts to track down undocumented immigrants. 

The [Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/08/trump-pardon-arpaio/537729/) puts pardon statement this way: 

> “Throughout his time as Sheriff, Arpaio continued his life’s work of protecting the public from the scourges of crime and illegal immigration,” the White House said in a statement. “Sheriff Joe Arpaio is now eighty-five years old, and after more than fifty years of honorable service to our Nation, he is [a] worthy candidate for a Presidential pardon.”

The president highlights Arpaio's old age and his service to Arizona in his [tweet](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/901263061511794688). 

Have such pardons been used before in a similar way?
