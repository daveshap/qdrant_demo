I think a girl in my school likes me and I need help
I thinks. Girl in my school likes me and I want opinions and help please

Hey so I’m a guy and I’m 16, (sophomore) and I think a girl likes me after my friend said he thought so because if any girl I’ve not spoken too much before willing talks to me and wants to she probably does. Although it’s very funny and kinda sad, it makes sense because most girls I don’t know don’t just go up to me and talk to me. Backstory though, she is a freshman and goes to my weekly tennis class, one day she asked me some questions about if I’m Varsity or JV and she said she knew I was from the same school because she sees me all the time. After that she at one point asked if we had practice that week in school while I was giving with friends. Then at practice we had to do doubles and have a partner for the practice and she asked if we could be partners.

The reason I asked this is because too be honest, I kinda do find her attractive cause she is very nice and pretty. Also I’m curious

Also if you think she does what should I do.
