Is a UK visa needed for a UK citizen's non-EU spouse with EU Family Member Residence Card to visit the UK together? Is a UK visa needed for a British citizen's non-EU spouse (who holds an EU Family Member Residence Card) if they wish to visit the UK together for a holiday? Both are currently living in the Netherlands, exercising \"Freedom of Movement\" rules for EU citizens and family members. I believe that an EEA citizen's spouse only needs a valid passport, the EU Family Member Residence Card and a marriage certificate, but does a British citizen count as an EEA citizen in this case?
