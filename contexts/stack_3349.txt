Who figured out Rand's fate and how? Re-reading A Memory Of Light again, and something that didn't bother me so much in the first read-through is that several key folks (his ladies plus Alivia) seemed to know Rand's fate before it happened.<blockquote class=\"spoiler\">   All of the Happy Harem, plus Alivia, and maybe others seem to know that Rand and Moridin switched bodies.  While after death this would make sense (as they continue to sense the bond), none of them were at his side when he was dying, none seemed worried, and Alivia had set up all the equipment and horse and such before he woke up. </blockquote>I realize that there could be a few explanations for this, but has there been anything published  by the author(s) or during interviews that indicate how this happened?
