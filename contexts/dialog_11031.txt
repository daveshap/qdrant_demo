MICHAEL: The ink on your divorce isn't dry. Your children see you on weekends; your oldest boy, Michael Francis... was in some trouble with the Reno police over some petty theft that you don't even know about.
CONNIE: Michael...
MICHAEL: You fly around the world with lazy young men who don't have any love for you, and use you like a whore.
CONNIE: You're not my father!
MICHAEL: Then why do you come to me?
CONNIE: Because I need MONEY!
MICHAEL: Connie, I want to be reasonable with you. You have a house here, with us. You can live here with your kids...and you won't be deprived of anything. I don't know much about Merle; I don't know what he does for a living; what he lives on. Why don't you tell him marriage is really out of the question; and that you can't see him any more. He'll understand. But if you disobey me, and marry this pimp...it would disappoint me.
CONNIE: It was my father's money; and I'm entitled to what I need. Where is Tom Hagen?
