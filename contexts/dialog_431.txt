MRS. JORDAN: Excuse us, dear.
ALICE: It's okay, Dan
MARK: That club sucks, they card everybody. Let's just party at your place.
GRETA: You know my mother -- get real. What about Alice's?
ALICE: My dad's got this thing about drinking in the house.
MARK: Well we gotta do something!
YVONNE: All right kids, I tell you what we're gonna do. I've got swimming practice until six-thirty today...
GRETA: Yeah...
YVONNE: That means they're gonna give me the key to the pool so I can lock up when I'm done.
