CAROLINE: He didn't hang around us. He's like one of those hippie kids. I'm not part of that group. It was a party in all these rooms. His girlfriend who I barely know was completely hysterical... He's blue, he's puking... We didn't want to get in trouble, but what were we supposed to do? I mean, what would you have done if you had been us?
BARBARA: How well do you know this boy, Seth, who was driving? You know the police have charged him with a DUI and possession of marijuana.
CAROLINE: He's a friend. He's also like the only one who was dealing with the situation. He'd definitely had a few beers, but it's not like he wanted to drive. We didn't know what else to do. It wasn't my pot.
