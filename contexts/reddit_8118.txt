AHCA Megathread
We are getting a ton of questions about the AHCA and so we have decided to make a megathread on the subject.

A few basic Q&As to start:

**What is the AHCA?**

It is the [healthcare bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1628) the Republican leadership in Congress has proposed to replace Obamacare.

**What does it do?**

Lots of stuff.  [Here's an article on the version of the bill first put forward in March.](https://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/a-healthcare-policy-expert-on-four-key-differences-between-the-aca-and-the-ahca)

**What are the recent amendments to it?**

There have been a couple of amendments to the bill in the last few days.  The big ones are:

* [The MacArthur Amendment](http://www.politifact.com/florida/article/2017/apr/28/politifacts-guide-gop-amendment-health-care-bill/) which would allow states to opt out of some essential health benefits requirements, as well as the requirement that insurers not charge more for people with pre-existing conditions.

* The [Upton Amendment](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/03/us/politics/gop-eyes-8-billion-addition-to-win-a-crucial-vote-to-the-latest-health-bill.html) which provides $8 billion in additional funding over 5 years, with the intention that it be used for "high risk pools" for persons with pre-existing conditions.

**What's going on with it now?**

House leadership is currently planning a vote on the bill today.  If it passes, it would move to the Senate.

**Edit 1:26 PM EDT** The New York Times is reporting a vote is expected around 1:30 PM.  [They have a live tracker of how members are voting here.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/05/04/us/politics/house-vote-republican-health-care-bill.html)

The House of Representatives has a livestream available at [houselive.gov](http://houselive.gov/)

**Edit: 1:59 PM** The House is currently voting on [HR 2192](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/2192) which would change a provision which had exempted members of Congress from the MacArthur Amendment.  It currently looks to be passing easily with support from Republicans and Democrats.


The AHCA vote is scheduled next I believe.

**2:11 PM** THE VOTE IS ON.

**2:19 PM** The AHCA has been passed by the House by a vote of 217-213.
