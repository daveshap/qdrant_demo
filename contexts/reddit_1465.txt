So I voted today and was shaking so badly I couldn't put my ballot into the scanner someone had to do it for me.
But you know what I actually don't feel that bad about it. All it was is a physical response and barely anyone noticed. Normally I would be obsessing about it all day but I'm not. So I thought that I would share I'm actually proud because I didn't let my anxiety prevent me from voting.
