Getting out of student media
Anyone ever seen someone successful leap out of student media into the broader area of student affairs? I'm director of student media with about 7 years experience all at one university. I have my M.Ed. in higher education. 

My boss says he'd consider me for roles outside my area, but nothing has really come up. I've applied for a few other jobs (director of student involvement, associate director of student affairs, etc.) at other universities, but no one has really been interested. I think at most colleges the student media role is in a little bit of a silo, and maybe doesn't fit in with the larger area of student affairs. I'm great at engaging students, retaining them, building relationships, working across all departments; seems like transferable skills to other roles, but I'm going up against folks with 7-10 years experience who have jumped departments every year to two years, and rightly, they seem like safer bets. 

Any thoughts on how I can make myself look like a more well-rounded candidate. I even considered asking my boss to change my title to something like "director of student engagement" just so I can look like a more well-rounded candidate. Don't know that he would go for it, but I feel like the "student media" thing is a bit of a detriment to my advancement.
