The Constant Burden of Performance as a Guy
Any other men just completed exhausted not only trying to be "that confidence, charismatic" guy when talking to women and during dates.

All I want to do is get to know someone and have a good time, if anything comes out of it its a bonus, that's how I view dates.  But I always feel like there is this additional expectation that I am charming/charismatic/ultra confident/witty. And whenever I fail to meet this expectation is when women run

This is coming from times I've met women and heard they were not interested because I was "a little more shy" or "I didn't project my voice enough" or "they met someone more charming". It  doesn't help that I'm bombarded with advice from female friends, from youtube dating coaches and from society about how they just LOVEEEE charming charismatic men. nothing more attractive than a man who has is back arched back, talks in DEEP MANLY VOICE THATS SLOW, throws a witty one liner every now and then.  Any semblance of anxiety - nope - instant ladyboner killer. nervous on a first date? (oh god forbid you are a little nervous when on a first date.) - better NOT SHOW IT otherwise its OVER.

Ok, I Get. we all have to play the part. Women spending all this time on makeup/hair/clothes to look good for dates/to go out.

But as a natural introvert, its completely exhausting.
