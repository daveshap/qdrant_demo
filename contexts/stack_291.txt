Is there any program that can add titlebar functionality to the menubar panel? Looking to reproduce the Unity/Gnome3 (Linux desktops) feature set on a Mac:specifically:adding various window management buttons to the menu bar panel (close, maximize, maybe tile left/right)drag from the top to drag a maximized window, just as you would drag from the top in Windows. On Gnome desktop you can just drag from the top to move a maximized window, even though there is a panel at the top of the screen just like on Mac. Really good use of Fitts law.double-click on empty space in the menubar panel to maximize/unmaximize a window.Are the any ready-made solutions to this? Are these features actually possible to implement on Mac?
