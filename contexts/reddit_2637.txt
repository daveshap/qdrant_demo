I feel like I’ve failed at 26. Is there a way forward?
Hope this doesn’t turn out too long.

I lost my mom at the start of college. It did me no favors as she was the only positive person in my life. College didn’t work out for me and I never graduated. I feel like I’ve failed massively in this regard. I studied networking (IT)

I have a decent gig right now making 40k-ish a year. However, I wanted to be so much more. I wanted to be able to support myself and my elderly father. I feel like I’ve peaked with what I’m working with right now. I talked to school counselors and discovered I’d have to start all the way from gen ed and basically redo a whole degree. This was super disheartening. I also don’t have the luxury of  quitting my job in order to focus on school as me and my father have supported each other since my mom died.  Also, even if I went back to school, I would not continue down the networking path as it is definitely not for me.

So I feel pretty stuck. My job is not a bad job, but like I said, I feel like I’ve peaked. I want to move upwards in life, and by that I don’t mean I want fancy things and wealth. I mean that I want stability, safety, and security for me and my loved ones. I don’t want to just get by and be at risk for losing it all. I miss feeling like I was building a life back when I was still in school. 

Has anyone here been in a similar situation? Anyone have advice for me?


EDIT: Guys I am going to respond to all of your comments once I get a chance later today. I didn’t think this would gain any traction. Thank you so much
