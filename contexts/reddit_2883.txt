I'm a college student: Tell me about your interesting, fulfilling jobs?
Hi everyone!

I'm a sophomore in college majoring in Global Studies and Economics with a concentration in Middle Eastern Conflict and Security with plans to go to graduate school 2-3 years after undergrad. Quarantine has given me a lot of time for existential crises, mainly about my future and career paths I could take. I'm one of those people who's interested in everything (travel, politics, history, creative writing, problem-solving), yet not sure how to make a successful and interesting career out of those interests. I'm also simultaneously worried about being a corporate sell-out and not being viewed as traditionally successful by not going down the consulting/Wall Street path that many intelligent college students are drawn to for the money and immediate prestige.

**I want you to tell me about the jobs that you have found fulfilling and (if you're willing) how you got to your position. It also doesn't have to be a "cool" job; if you're a consultant or a Wall Street analyst or a have a corporate job and love it, I want to hear why.**

Just trying to see some possibilities that I hadn't thought of. Thank you in advance!
