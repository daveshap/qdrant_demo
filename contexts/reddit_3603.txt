Does anyone else get the irrational feeling that they will never find mutual love again after a breakup?
I broke up with my GF a couple months ago and every once and awhile I get this sense of despair that I will never find anyone else who would have romantic feelings for me and vice-versa. Anyone else get this feeling? If so, how long did it last for you?

Edit: Wow this blew up, Thank you all for providing your different insights and I wish the best for all of you :)
