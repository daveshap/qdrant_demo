Got fired for taking a dump
I worked at health department on contract, I have a bad stomach so every morning after thumbprint and attendance being confirmed I ran to the bathroom to take a dump. Everyone knows because I went every morning for a year included my boss, but on monday my boss had a very bad mood and after I went back to the office room he was like ' where were you huh? ' and I said taking a dump, and then he said well you didn't asked for my permission ( I usually didn't but there was never a problem) and I said I don't see a issue here because go every morning, he got mad because I answered back and fired me, now I have rely on saving during this quarantine.

Country: Malaysia

Edit: 2 week ago I walked in  on him cheating on his wife with his assistant. Maybe he saw me as threat.
