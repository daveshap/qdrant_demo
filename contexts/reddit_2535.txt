I am a 23 year old software engineer and I'm not happy in my job. Advice for alternate career paths?
I like coding, but I'm finding that doing it for 8-10 hours a day 5 days a week is making me miserable. I also think a big factor in my unhappiness is that I am indoors all the time and don't interact with other people much. I often have no motivation to work and have very unproductive days. It is only very recently that I've considered that this job might not be the best fit for me, but I'm kind of at a loss when it comes to considering other options. Some random ideas that have come up in the last month: becoming a locksmith or working on a farm or just anything that gets me out in the world instead of sitting at a desk all day. I get out on the weekends and before and after work every day for exercise, but I still find it's not enough. I have an AA degree and this software job is the first real job I've ever had, which started in October 2018. Anyone have advice for figuring out what I want to do?

Edit: I am in south Florida
