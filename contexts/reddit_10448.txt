Passive Suicidal Thoughts
Whenever I'm at a crosswalk and a car is stopped for me, I think of getting them to step on it. Whenever I'm at the top of a staircase, I think of letting myself fall down it. Whenever I'm at a ledge, I think of stepping over it and hitting the ground below. Even though these things probably wouldn't kill me and would just leave me with some horrible injuries, I still can't help but think of them every single day. There's always that ever-so-slight push in the back of my mind trying to guide me into giving up and giving in to these thoughts.
