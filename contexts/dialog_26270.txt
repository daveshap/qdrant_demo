NORMA: Go away.
GILLIS: What kind of a silly thing was that to do?
NORMA: To fall in love with you -- that was the idiotic thing.
GILLIS: It sure would have made attractive headlines: Great Star Kills Her- self for Unknown Writer.
NORMA: Great stars have great pride.
NORMA: Go away. Go to that girl of yours.
GILLIS: Look, I was making that up because I thought the whole thing was a mistake. I didn't want to hurt you. You've been good to me. You're the only person in this stinking town that has been good to me.
NORMA: Why don't you just say thank you and go, go, go --
GILLIS: Not until you promise to act like a sensible human being.
NORMA: I'll do it again, I'll do it again, I'll do it again!
