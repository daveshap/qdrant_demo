JEREMIAH: 'Sup Jimmy B. Shotgun. Get back on the curb! Now!
BONES: Go easy on Jay Bird. I can remember when we was his age...
JEREMIAH: It's all arranged for tonight. Eddie Mack's gonna be there. And Offisa Korruptsky, too.
BONES: They get about twelve and a half minutes. Tops.
JEREMIAH: Trust me, Jimmy, there's big money behind this. Not just big. BIG. Like big business big. Big corporation big. Big government big. Our little acre alone'll net hundreds a thousands. Nothing but net.
BONES: Nothing but net? Could be a swish. Or a muthafucking air ball.
JEREMIAH: One simple word, three little letters. Yes. That's all it's gonna take and we could move out of this dump, get the real deal. Big houses, legit business...
BONES: That's your dream, Homes. Not mine. I don't want to leave this street. Ever. The status quo is totally cool with me.
PEARL: Maybe I oughtta get there a little early. For good luck.
BONES: Don't need luck tonight. I'm just letting 'em have their say before I say no.
PEARL: Let me see your hand.
BONES: All that shinin' and reader and adviser" mess. That was your mama's bag. I don't know about the readin' but you both can sure 'nuff advise."
PEARL: My mama's bag and my granma's bag, and a long line of mamas before her.
BONES: Sounds like mama needs a brand new bag.
