How does one usually compute the gradient and the Hessian of a proposal in a MCMC algorithm? In some proposals of a MCMC, the mean/location vector and the covariance/scale matrix are functions of the gradient/jacobian and hessian of the log-likelihood.I'm wondering how does one usually find the gradient and hessian for complex models?Is it by a numerical routine/procedure? Which one?Or do they simply use a BFGS type of algorithm to find the maximisers of the log-likelihood?
