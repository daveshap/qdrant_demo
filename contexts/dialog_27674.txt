MELANIE: I really shouldn't have any more. I'm a little tipsy already.
MITCH: I'm trying to get you to stay for dinner. We're going to have a lot of roast left over.
MELANIE: I couldn't possibly. I have to get back.
MITCH: Cheers.
MELANIE: Cheers.
MELANIE: What's in this? Nitro-glycerin?
MITCH: Why do you have to rush off? What's so important in San Francisco?
MELANIE: Well... I have to get to work tomorrow morning, for one thing.
MITCH: You have a job?
MELANIE: I have several jobs.
MITCH: What do you do?
MELANIE: I do different things on different days.
MITCH: Like what?
MELANIE: On Mondays and Wednesdays, I work for the Travelers' Aid. At the airport.
MITCH: Helping travelers.
MELANIE: Yes.
MELANIE: And on Tuesdays, I take a course in General Semantics at Berkeley. That's not a job, of course. I just take it because...
MITCH: What about Thursdays and Fridays?
MELANIE: On Thursdays I have my meeting and lunch. I'm chairman of a group that's sending a little Korean boy through school. We plan how to raise funds and... things like that.
MITCH: And Fridays? What do you do then?
MELANIE: Nothing. I go to bird shops on Fridays.
MITCH: I'm glad you do.
MELANIE: Do you know what I was doing in that shop?
MITCH: What?
MELANIE: I have an aunt, you see. Aunt Tessa. She's seventy years old, and veddy prim and strait-laced. She's coming back from Europe at the end of the month, and I'm going to give her a myna bird that'll talk to her.
MITCH: What'll it say?
MELANIE: You'll think me very bold, sir.
MITCH: No, tell me.
