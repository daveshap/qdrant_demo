MIKE: Well, thank you...?
BLONDE: Nikki.
MIKE: Thank you, Nikki.
TRENT: We got the digits, baby.
MIKE: What a surprise.
TRENT: What's wrong? I saw you talking to that beautiful blonde baby.
SUE: She was cute.
MIKE: She didn't like me... I made a fool of myself...
TRENT: Baby, don't talk that way, baby...
SUE: You are so money, and you don't even know it...
TRENT: That's what I keep trying to tell him. You're so money, you don't even know...
MIKE: Please, don't mess with me right now...
TRENT: We're not messing with you...
SUE: ...we're not...
TRENT: You're like this big bear with claws and fangs...
SUE: ...and big fuckin' teeth...
TRENT: ...and teeth... And she's like this little bunny cowering in the corner...
SUE: ...shivering...
TRENT: ...And you're just looking at your claws like How do I kill this bunny?"..."
SUE: ...You're just poking at it...
TRENT: ...Yeah. You're just gently batting it around... and the rabbit's all scared...
SUE: ...and you got big claws and fangs...
TRENT: ...and fangs... and you're like I don't know what to do. How do I kill this bunny?"..."
SUE: ...you're like a big bear.
MIKE: You're not just, like, fucking with me?
TRENT: No, baby!
SUE: ...honestly...
TRENT: ...you're money...
SUE: ...you're so fuckin mmmoney.
TRENT: Now go over there and get those digits.
SUE: You're money.
TRENT: Now when you talk to her, I don't want you to be the guy in the PG-13 movie that everyone's pulling for. I want you to be the guy in the rated R movie who you're not sure if you like.
