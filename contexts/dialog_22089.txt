NICK: Millie here used to serve drinks to these gunrunning truckers, real big talkers, talking bout a real score one day. I was in the Mountain, man, what the hell, why not let her get friendly with 'em? Let her tell 'em an idea she had, 'bout writing guys in prison. Getting one who could show 'em a sure thing.
RUDY: She set them up. All of them.
NICK: Why not have her pretend to find me? Pretend to write me and reel me in? Tell her new trucker-man she'd pose as some sister of his named Ashley?
RUDY: And you set me up.
NICK: Always wanted to rob that casino, Rudy. Way back when I worked there. What better way than to get some guys to rob it for me.
NICK: Paid the Alamo ten bucks to put the shiv in me. He's a lifer, what does he care. Paid a hospital guard fifty to put out the story I was dead. Once the wound healed up... Got out of the Mountain this morning. And tonight I'm a rich man.
RUDY: How'd you know I'd do it.
NICK: Do what?
RUDY: Walk outta there and tell her I was you.
