SOMERSET: You meant what you said to Mrs. Gould, didn't you? About catching this guy. You really want to believe that, don't you?
MILLS: And you don't?
SOMERSET: I wish I still thought like you.
MILLS: Then, you tell me what you think we're doing.
SOMERSET: All we do is pick up the pieces. We take all the evidence, and all the pictures and samples. We write everything down and note what time things happened...
MILLS: Oh, that's all.
SOMERSET: We put it in a nice neat pile and file it away, on the slim chance it's ever needed in a courtroom. It's like collecting diamonds on a desert island. You keep them just in case you ever get rescued, but it's a pretty big ocean out there.
MILLS: Bullshit.
SOMERSET: I'm, sorry, but even the most promising clues usually lead only to other clues. I've seen so many corpses rolled away... unrevenged.
MILLS: I've seen the same. I'm not the country hick you seem to think I am.
SOMERSET: In this city, if all the skeletons came out of all the closets... if ever hidden body were to suddenly rise again, there'd be no more room for the living.
