You’re doing great
I’ve been reading a lot of posts and comments about being tired and fed up with the dating apps and dating culture. 

I’m sorry that people have been nasty. I’m sorry that people have treated you poorly. These people have probably been treated terribly as well and aren’t doing the work to forgive and grow. 

It’s rough out here, not just in dating, but in life in general. Try to protect your heart and sense of worth. If you’re feeling run down, take a break from swiping, do your best to treat yourself kindly. You are valuable and worthy of positive experiences. 

You’re doing great! There are gems out there, be the gem you’re looking for.
