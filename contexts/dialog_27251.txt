KURTZWEIL: Those people were already dead.
MULDER: Before the bomb went off?
KURTZWEIL: That's what I'm saying.
MULDER: Michaud was a twenty-two year veteran of the bureau --
KURTZWEIL: Michaud was a patriot. The men he's loyal to know their way around Dallas. They blew that building to hide something. Maybe something even they couldn't predict.
MULDER: You're saying they destroyed an entire building to hide the bodies of three firemen...?
KURTZWEIL: And one little boy.
MULDER: I think you're full of shit.
KURTZWEIL: Do you?
MULDER: I wake you?
SCULLY: No.
MULDER: Why not? It's three AM.
SCULLY: Are you drunk, Mulder?
MULDER: I was until about an hour ago.
SCULLY: Is that before or after you got the idea to come here?
MULDER: What are you implying, Scully?
SCULLY: I thought you may have gotten drunk and decided to come here to talk me out of quitting.
MULDER: Is that what you'd like me to do?
SCULLY: Go home, Mulder. It's late.
MULDER: Get dressed, Scully.
SCULLY: Mulder -- what are you doing?
MULDER: Just get dressed. I'll explain on the way.
CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: You've got something to show me.
DR. BRONSCHWEIG: Yes.
DR. BRONSCHWEIG: We brought the atmosphere back down to freezing in order to control the development, which is nothing like we've ever seen.
CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: Brought on by what?
DR. BRONSCHWEIG: Heat, I think. The coincident invasion of a host, the fireman, and an environment that raised his basic body temperature above ninety eight point six.
CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: This man's still alive.
DR. BRONSCHWEIG: Technically and biologically, though he'll never recover.
CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: How can this be?
DR. BRONSCHWEIG: The developing organism is using his life energy, digesting bone and tissue. We've just slowed the process.
DR. BRONSCHWEIG: Do you want me to destroy this one, too? Before it gestates?
CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: No. No...we need to try our vaccine on it.
DR. BRONSCHWEIG: And if it's unsuccessful?
CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: Incinerate it. Like the others.
DR. BRONSCHWEIG: This man's family will want to see the body laid to rest.
CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: Tell them he was trying to save the young boy's life, and that he died heroically like the other firemen.
DR. BRONSCHWEIG: Of what?
CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: They seemed to buy our story about the Hanta virus. You'll make sure the families are taken care of financially, along with a sizeable donation to the community. Maybe a small roadside memorial.
