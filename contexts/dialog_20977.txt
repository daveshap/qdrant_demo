SUSAN: What? Oh, I'm sorry, Nigel. I was just thinking...
NEBBLEMAN: Aaabout...?
SUSAN: This morning. I saw someone I haven't seen in a long time.
NEBBLEMAN: A man?
SUSAN: Yeah. I knew him when I was still in school.
NEBBLEMAN: What did he want?
SUSAN: I'm not sure. That's the funny thing about him. He's the kind of guy that you never know what he wants or what he might do to get it.
