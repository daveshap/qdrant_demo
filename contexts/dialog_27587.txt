ENZO: I'm concentrating.
JACQUES: We can't dive anymore. They want to cancel the competition for a while.
JACQUES: It's not safe, they say. The doctors say it isn't possible to go deeper and live. Free diving is over as a sport.
ENZO: You say that because you have the title!
JACQUES: No! I would never cheat you.
ENZO: Well that's very nice of you.
ENZO: You were right.
JACQUES: ... I was right about what?
ENZO: ... It is much better down there. It's a better place.
ENZO: ... Push me back in the water...
JACQUES: I can't.
ENZO: Jacques, take me back down... Please.
