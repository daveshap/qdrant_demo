Lack of a degree
Recently I had the opportunity of interviewing at a company for a position. The screening phase with the recruiter had went well. Only questions they had for me was testing my ability to do the job. In addition, they were just curious if this job was in line with my career path. After our call, they said there would be an official application being emailed to me. They needed me to fill this out if I wanted to move forward in the process. The job requires a bachelors degree but I don't have one. I can do the job but again, I don't have a degree. I didn't claim the degree on my resume neither did I indicate that I graduated on the application. Even after doing this I was offered to move forward in the interview process. The other day I had another interview with someone there. They inquired about the degree being left off of my resume. I think they believe I graduated because I told them the name but didn't clarify it being incomplete. I have another interview with them soon and I'm not sure how to proceed. Should I use the next interview as an opportunity to clarify this?
