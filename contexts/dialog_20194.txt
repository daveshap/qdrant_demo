PHONE: Who's this?
FAITH: This is his fiancee. Who's this?
PHONE: Oh, hi. I'm an old high school buddy of Dwayne's. I was in town this weekend, was hoping to stop by and surprise him. But I've gotta catch a plane so I'm afraid I'm not gonna be able to make it.
FAITH: I'm sure he'll be sorry to hear that. Who should I tell him called?
PHONE: My name's
FAITH: I can hardly hear you. Could you spell that?
FAITH: Damon Bradley...
PHONE: Right. Thanks a lot. And congratulations. It's not easy finding love these days.
FAITH: WAIT!! Where are you?
PHONE: I'm at the airport. Why?
FAITH: Uh-- in case Dwayne wants to try to reach you.
PHONE: Well, he'd have to hurry. My flight leaves at four o'clock.
FAITH: Where are you going?
PHONE: I'm on my way to Venice. Why?
FAITH: Venice? I love Venice. With the boats, right?...
PHONE: Huh? Uh, yeah-- I've gotta run. Tell Dwayne hi. Maybe someday we can all get together.
