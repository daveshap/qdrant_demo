How can I get Sql Server 2016 on a 32-bit server? I didn't build it, but we've got a 32-bit Windows Server 2008, with SQL server 2008 and 4GB of RAM.I need to upgrade it to SQL Server 2016 in order to log ship to a new server, so we can put this thing out of its misery.  The problem - it looks like SQL Server 2016 requires, at minimum, Windows Server 2012, which is only 64-bit.  Question: how can I migrate the data to a SQL 2016 server with &lt;1 day of downtime?  Is there a way to get around it with compatibility levels?
