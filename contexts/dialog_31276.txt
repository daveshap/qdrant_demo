ELI: How can this be? How can you do such a thing? Is this plain? Is this the ordnung?
RACHEL: I have done nothing against the ordnung.
ELI: Eh? Nothing? Rachel, you bring this man to our house. With his gun of the hand. You bring fear to this house. Fear of English with guns coming after. You bring blood and whispers of more blood. Now English music... and you are dancing to English music! And you call this nothing?
RACHEL: I have committed no sin.
ELI: No sin? Maybe. Not yet. But, Rachel, it does not look... Don't you know there has been talk? Talk about you, not him. Talk about going to the Bishop. About having you... shunned!
RACHEL: That is idle talk.
ELI: Do not make light of it, Rachel. They can do it... quick! Like that! And then... then I can not sit at table with you. I can not take a thing from your hand. I... I can not go with you to meeting! Rachel, good Rachel, you must not go too far! Dear child!
RACHEL: I am not a child.
ELI: You are acting like one!
RACHEL: I will be the judge of that.
ELI: No! They will be the judge of that! And so will I... if you shame me!
RACHEL: You shame yourself.
SCHAEFFER: You know where he is.
CARTER: Wrong.
SCHAEFFER: You'd lie to protect him.
CARTER: Probably.
SCHAEFFER: You admit you're lying?
CARTER: I admit I don't know where he is.
SCHAEFFER: You're the first one he'll contact.
CARTER: He's got my number.
