KEEPER: Raban" -- that'll be nearly at the back of the alphabet."
KAFKA: It usually is.
KEEPER: I'm not obliged to give you access, you know -- not without authorization -- but I'll make an exception this one time.
KEEPER: I'm overworked as it is. Raban" did you say?"
KAFKA: Yes. Isn't it there?
KEEPER: Wait a minute. Raban?" Where have I heard that name?"
KAFKA: He's the clerk who died last week. From the insurance department
KAFKA: What's the matter?
KEEPER: Why would we keep files on <u>dead</u> employees? All old files are sent up to the Castle. Do you think we have room for two hundred years worth personnel records?
KAFKA: It's gone out so quickly?
KEEPER: Whenever an employee departs, shall we say, it's up to the head of his department to requisition his file, reassign any outstanding claims, and send it off.
KAFKA: -- You mean my Chief has it.
KAFKA: Excuse me, sir -- I understand you have Eduard Raban's file.
CHIEF CLERK: I do.
KAFKA: I wonder if I might look to see if there's an address for family -- I thought I'd like to write to them.
