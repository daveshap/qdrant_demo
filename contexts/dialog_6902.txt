OLIVER: Amy, make a wish. Wish real hard, and then blow out the candles, and your wish will come true.
AMY: But wishes don't come true.
OLIVER: Certain wishes do.
AMY: But you told me in the garden-- that the wish about the tree couldn't come true.
OLIVER: But this is different. Go on blow,
ALICE: You get your wish!
AMY: You know what I wished, Daddy? I wished I could be a good girl.
