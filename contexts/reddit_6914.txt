Company has had 2 rounds of layoffs in 3 months, company president has said no guarantees of more layoffs come 2020, am I reacting too soon in looking for a new job?
I’ve been with my current employer as an Implementation project manager since April 2019 and frankly, I love my job and my team that I work with. It’s the first job in over 3 years that I truly enjoy and have a great work/life balance. 

But we’ve recently started merging with our partner company (we’re under the same parent company and work with them pretty consistently) and we’ve seen a handful of execs leave for other job opportunities in the last 2 months.  I thought- good for them.

But recently the company has laid off about 30-35 people in the span of 3 months and our company is less than 2,000 employees so it worries a lot of us. 

Some of the folks they laid off have been senior/long-time employees, SMEs etc. so we were shocked to hear about some of the more senior folks being let go. 

I haven’t been here for a long time but I know my role in my department is vital (primarily customer-facing) so I know I am safe for the rest of 2019. 

During an all-company meeting, the president of our department did state that he has no guarantees about more “downsizing” come the new year. Which had a lot of my coworkers’ ears perked up and worrying even more. 

I’ve polished my resume & started looking at jobs on LinkedIn & Glassdoor. Am I wrong to be looking so early for a new role? If I do get contacted by a potential new employer, how do I explain why reason for wanting to leave my current employer?
