FLETCH: No. You can't. Look, I know you don't know me from Adam, but you've got to trust me.
MRS. STANWYK: Trust you? I may seem a little goofy at times, but I'm not a complete Bozo, you know.
FLETCH: Just give me twenty-four hours. Please. Someone almost killed me today. People are not being nice lately, and I don't want you getting hurt. I think you're terrific. Are you a Laker fan?
MRS. STANWYK: No... I've got to go to Mr. Underhill...
FLETCH: I'll take you to a game.
MRS. STANWYK: What are you talking about?
FLETCH: I'm talking about how much I'd like to take you to a Laker game.
MRS. STANWYK: Wait a second. What am I supposed to do for twenty-four hours?
FLETCH: Act natural.
MRS. STANWYK: I was afraid you'd say that.
FLETCH: If you need me, call the paper. Hand me that extra bottle okay?
