FLETCH: I'll be leaving now, Mrs. Stanwyk.
MRS. STANWYK: I think you should call me Gail, now.
FLETCH: Gail. I hope this won't embarrass you in any way. I think Underhill's a yutz, you won't have any trouble with him.
MRS. STANWYK: Why did you do it?
MRS. STANWYK: A four hundred dollar lunch tab!
FLETCH: Yeah.
MRS. STANWYK: I'll cover it. You have any other surprises?
FLETCH: Yeah. My name's not John Ultramalensky and I wasn't at your wedding.
MRS. STANWYK: Who.
FLETCH: Irwin Fletcher. I write a newspaper column under the name Jane Doe.
MRS. STANWYK: So?
FLETCH: So, your husband hired me to kill him. That's the truth.
MRS. STANWYK: What are you talking about?
FLETCH: That's what I want to know.
MR. UNDERHILL: Mrs. Stanwyk!
MRS. STANWYK: In a minute!
FLETCH: He told me he was dying of cancer. Not True. That ranch you thought you were paying for in Utah? Not true.
MRS. STANWYK: How do you know about that?
FLETCH: He's a bad guy, Mrs. Stanwyk. Gail. I think he's involved in something very big and very bad.
MRS. STANWYK: What does all this mean?
FLETCH: Have you ever heard the name Jim Swarthout?
MRS. STANWYK: Swarthout. Yes. He's the man who sold us the ranch in --
FLETCH: Wrong. He sold you $3,000 worth of scrub brush.
MRS. STANWYK: But I've seen the deed.
FLETCH: You saw a forgery.
