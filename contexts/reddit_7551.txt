Found out I actually am not going to have retake a class!
I’m taking a class called Fate and Transport of Chemicals in the Environment and I got Cs on the midterm and the final. I thought I was going to fail the class because my overall grade would be a 77. I was pouring over reddit and reading how a C is equivalent to an F. I though I was going to go into a deep state of terror and depression. Then I read my syllabus and it not only said that there is a curve, a 77 is considered a B-!!!! This means because of the curve, I’ll probably get a B or B+ in the class!!!! I thanked Jesus, Allah, Buddha, Vishnu, and the universe in general what a good day.
