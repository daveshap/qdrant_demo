BADCHUCK: I'm lost. Goodbye.
GOODCHUCK: No!
BADCHUCK: Look, just slip off the raft. The ocean would feel so good, the water's so soft and warm. Take a little swim. Sleep.
GOODCHUCK: You quitter you quitter you quitter.
BADCHUCK: The sea is lovely, dark and deep.
GOODCHUCK: But I have promises to keep. And miles to go before I sleep. And miles to go before I sleep. Got to fix the sea anchor. Use the sail.
BADCHUCK: Use the sail for a sea anchor and you won't move.
GOODCHUCK: If I don't have a sea anchor I'll capsize.
BADCHUCK: Die tomorrow or die today.
BADCHUCK: That's death knocking, knocking on your door. Crazy little woman come knocking, knocking at my front door...
GOODCHUCK: Grow up, stop being such a baby. Other people get through a lot worse.
BADCHUCK: Yeah, sure, what?
