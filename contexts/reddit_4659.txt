I want to give up on life
I'm completely exhausted. I have no motivation to do anything in life anymore. 

The only things I feel like doing are sleeping, being on my phone, and eating. Even then, nothing actually brings me pleasure or happiness. I can't even put effort into anything anymore because I become so distracted and everything feels so hopeless so I procrastinate so much. 

Just thinking about what to write on this post is hard but I really really want to vent so much but I just cant explain it all. In school my grades are suffering because I end up missing school a lot, either due to depression or panic attacks. 

All I wanna do in life is sleep and eat and use the internet, I used to have so many interests, for example, drawing and gaming. I would draw all the time and was really into improving my art, but these days it feels like such hard work even getting a piece of paper out. When i start up my favourite games, it's sometimes hard to even play one round (like in splatoon) because it feels so pointless and repetitive. 

Everything just feels like a chore to be honest. A lot of the time it feels painful, like emotionally painful, just to wake up, a mixed feeling of dread and sadness and fear and disappointment. 

This post most likely will not be noticed but these are just my feelings and I really really need advice I guess.
