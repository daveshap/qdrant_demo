[Meta] COVID-19 Fact Checking Resources
On March 11, 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized the outbreak of COVID-19 [(aka novel coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019) as a [pandemic](https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---11-march-2020). As such, the moderation team felt compelled to provide some guidelines to assist all participants in developing their own fact-based understanding of the COVID-19 outbreak.

We acknowledge this post is not typical for /r/NeutralPolitics but the moderation team felt it necessary to push back against the [spread of misinformation](https://graphics.reuters.com/CHINA-HEALTH-RESEARCH/0100B5ES3MG/index.html) in hopes of keeping everyone both well informed and safe. 


***What is COVID-19 and what symptoms does it cause?*** 

COVID-19 is a [viral infection](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf) caused by a member of a family of large viruses known as coronavirus. Originally isolated to Wuhan,China, the illness has now been reported in [118 countries across all major continents](https://who.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/c88e37cfc43b4ed3baf977d77e4a0667). 

Symptoms appear to occur within [2-14 days](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/symptoms.html) after initial exposure, with [one study](https://annals.org/aim/fullarticle/2762808/incubation-period-coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-from-publicly-reported) suggesting an average incubation period of 5.1 days. It is possible to be infected with the COVID-19 virus but not show any symptoms of illness, a state known as asymptomatic infection. Asymptomatic infection is considered relatively rare and early data suggests that asymptomatic viral shedding [does not appear to be a driver of infection](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf). Most symptoms are generally mild and begin gradually but include fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. 

Currently the [basic reproduction number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_reproduction_number) or R0 (pronounced R-naught or R-zero) is estimated to be anywhere from [2.0](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf) to [3.11](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.23.20018549v2). The R0, which is not a fixed value, is thought of as the expected number of cases directly generated by one case in a population where all individuals are susceptible to infection. For context, the R0 for the seasonal flu is estimated at [1.28](https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2334-14-480) while the 2009 H1N1 Influenza outbreak R0 was at 1.46 and 1.48.  While most cases are mild, [early reports from China](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2002032) indicated that 16% of COVID-19 cases were severe and as of March 11th COVID-19 mortality rates are 3.4% globally.

It's worth noting that early data is often [incomplete and can be misleading](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-deaths-from-coronavirus-are-so-high-in-italy/), with [many experts](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-mortality/why-covid-19-death-rates-are-not-what-they-seem-idUSKBN20Z281) expressing [caution over](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/early-mortality-rates-covid-19-misleading-experts/story?id=69477312) over early reported data.


***COVID-19 Myths and Fact Checking***

As with any developing story, [myths](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/myth-busters) are common. Many health agencies and organizations [like the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/share-facts.html) or the [American Public Health Association](https://www.apha.org/topics-and-issues/communicable-disease/coronavirus) have published simple COVID-19 fact sheets that may be used to verify claims. 


As a general practice it's always good to consider the source, history, evidence, emotion, and pictures (or [SHEEP)](https://firstdraftnews.org/latest/5-tips-ways-we-can-all-covid19-check-coronavirus-information-online-fake-disinformation-misinformation/) of a source. Tools like Google's [Fact Checker Tool](https://toolbox.google.com/factcheck/explorer) and Poynter's [International Fact Checking Network](https://www.poynter.org/media-news/fact-checking/) may provide additional context. 

***Where can I find the current status of the outbreak?***

The WHO is currently publishing daily [situation reports](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports/). These reports include global morbidity (the state of having the disease) and mortality (death from the disease) counts.  

***How can I protect myself?***

While we are still learning about how COVID-19 affects people, older persons and persons with pre-existing medical conditions (such as high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, cancer or diabetes) appear to develop serious illness more often than others. Fortunately, there are [many basic protective measures](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public) an individual can take to reduce their chance of COVID-19 infection.

* Frequent Hand Washing for at [least 20 seconds](https://ew.com/music/coronavirus-covid-19-hand-wash-songs/)
* Maintain a proper social distance of at least 1 meter or 3 feet between you and others
* Avoid touching your face
* Stay at home if you're not feeling well
* If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance to avoid unnecessarily overwhelming local health systems
* Follow the directions of your local health authority. 

If traveling locally or abroad, relevant travel guidelines may exist.

***What can /r/neutralpolitics do?***

We are a fact-based political subreddit and intend for this post to be a resource for others. As such, we are asking that commenters provide links to the COVID-19 response pages for local, state/provincial, or national health agencies to allow other users to quickly find information relevant to them. Health based NGO's like the [International Red Cross and Red Crescent](https://media.ifrc.org/ifrc/press-release/covid-19-ifrc-unicef-issue-guidance-protect-children-support-safe-school-operations/) are also permissible.
