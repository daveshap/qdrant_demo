CALLER: What?
PETER: You heard me. Why did you go out to the institute looking for her?
CALLER: What makes you think I was there?
PETER: I couldn't tell you that. It would ruin the game.
CALLER: The game's almost over, Peter, and you're running out of time.
PETER: It's you who's running out of time. You're starting to make mistakes now. You're wondering just how much I really know. Just how close I'm getting? Well, I'm closer than you think, pal -- and I'm gonna nail your ass to the wall!
CALLER: Very nice speech, Peter. Did you rehearse that, or was it impromptu? There's an old wooden bench in the garden. Next to it is a rock. You'll find a message for you under it. Let's see if you're as clever as you think you are.
