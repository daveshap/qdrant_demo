I finally overcame my fear of physical intimacy. It might not seem like much, but it's a huge milestone for me
I went to the night club and got drunk. Some girl approached me. For once in my life I stopped overthinking it, and just lived the moment. We ended up kissing for a minute or something. It's not much, I know, and I didn't feel anything. But it's a huge milestone for me 

Thanks to everyone who encouraged me here to face my fears head on


EDIT: Oh man, this really blew up. Thanks for the kind words everyone!
