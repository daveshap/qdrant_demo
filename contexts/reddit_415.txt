Should I talk to him???
(I'm 17 and female). At school I have a group of friends, we are ten. So there's this guy that I've always had issues with. We have strong characters and our jokes can get a little insulting...

The point is that we don't have the best relationship and he texted me a week ago that he wanted to arrange a day to go out or call each other to talk about everything and try to get along better. The problem is that he didn't contact me again (he said we could talk last week) and I don't know if he wants me to take the next step (because he took the initiative) or he just decided to let it go or forgot about it. I'm very insecure so I don't want to bother him but have no idea what's the right thing to do (even though I think we should stop being so mean to each other). Maybe it's not necessary to talk about it(?
