What has been causing increased political polarization within the United States?
[There has been a measurable increase in the growing political divide](http://www.people-press.org/interactives/political-polarization-1994-2017/) within the United States today. This has created a hostile atmosphere for political discussion that is leading to gridlock within our system, and severe cultural rifts within the populace.

Some sources say that it is due to [news network media](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettedkins/2017/06/27/u-s-media-among-most-polarized-in-the-world-study-finds/#167d2e582546) while other sources claim that its [social media websites like twitter and facebook](https://hewlett.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Social-Media-Political-Polarization-and-Political-Disinformation-Literature-Review.pdf). However, I don't buy either of these explanations, as I believe they are examples of symptoms, not the cause.
