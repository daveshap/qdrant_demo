CHUCK: Feels different doesn't it?
JOHN: What?
CHUCK: That we're going back. I don't want it to end. I don't want to be what I was when I left.
JOHN: What was that?
CHUCK: Anonymous.
CHUCK: I've been getting ninety-sixes my whole life. It's what they expect. After all this, I still haven't figured it out.
JOHN: Figured what out?
CHUCK: Who I am, outside of this boat. What the hell I'm doing here.
JOHN: I'll tell you who you are. You're the glue. You're the thing that holds everybody around you together. You're strong, you listen and you see things in people the rest of us can't. It's a gift.
CHUCK: You know, I never had friends like this.
JOHN: Me either.
CHUCK: I feel like... we can do anything.
