[ADVICE] What should I expect from an MPH?
I am starting my MPH with a specialization in Health Policy and Management program this fall. I was wondering on what kind of starting salary, type of jobs (like administration), and opportunities that would open up from completing this program.  Plus, i was wondering peopleâ€™s opinions on my specialization of choice. Thanks in advance!
