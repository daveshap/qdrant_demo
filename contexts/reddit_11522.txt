Communication is so hard for me
I seem to have anxiety or something because it is so hard for me to communicate my needs. In my brain my needs are always just ridiculous and I should just keep them to myself, so it takes me days to work up the courage to communicate something sort of important. Or if I get drunk then I will accidentally let things slip that I want to keep hidden because I think its just too crazy to talk about. 

For instance, for a long time I thought I didnt want kids, but now I do. My boyfriend and I had agreed early on that we weren't going to have kids, so I just kept my change in feelings locked away in my mind, and I was just going to try to move past it myself. Anyway about a week ago when we got drunk, I accidentally let it slip. And it turned out very good that I did because it forced me then to talk about it more with my boyfriend, and turns out hes not against having kids, so in a few years time, we are having kids. 

But even little things like asking if I can set up an aquarium or get a pet (not that I really need to ask, but I prefer to) causes my heart to race and my anxiety(?) to go through the roof.
