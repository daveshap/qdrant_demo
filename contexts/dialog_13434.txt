MRS. RAND: Wesley!
DR. MAXWELL: I am afraid, Wesley, he has that right. And I will have to urge him to use it.
RAND: I tell you he hasn't and he wouldn't dare use it if he had.
JEFFRIES: Why?
RAND: Because he drove Jessica insane -- deliberately -- coldly!
JEFFRIES: That could be a serious accusation, Rand, if it weren't a foolish one.
RAND: Foolish? Tell them how foolish it is, Paul -- tell them!
