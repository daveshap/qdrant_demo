DAMONE: Listen. I feel pretty strange here. Because Mark really likes you, and he's my friend.
STACY: He's my friend, too.
DAMONE: You're a really good kisser.
STACY: So are you. Are you shaking?
DAMONE: No. Are you crazy?
STACY: Why don't you take off your clothes, Mike?
DAMONE: You first.
STACY: How about both of us at the same time?
STACY: I want you to know that it's your final decision if we should continue or not.
DAMONE: Let's continue.
STACY: Hey, Mike?
DAMONE: What? Are you all right?
STACY: I think we're making a lot of noise.
DAMONE: I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
STACY: What's wrong?
DAMONE: I think I came. Didn't you feel it?
STACY: I guess I did.
