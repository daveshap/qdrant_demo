If you’re going to make the choice to date right now then prepare.
Prepare for delays in communication. 

Prepare for a lack of consistency. 

Prepare for emotional unavailability. 

Prepare for waning interest. 

Prepare for general disappointment because there’s just so much going on in so many different peoples lives right now that, fucking honestly and goddamn, it’s just not a good time to date right now.
