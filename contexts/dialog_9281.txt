MARGE: How we doin' on that vehicle?
LOU: No motels registered any tan Ciera last night. But the night before, two men checked into the Blue Ox registering a Ciera and leavin' the tag space blank.
MARGE: Geez, that's a good lead. The Blue Ox, that's that trucker's joint out there on I-35?
LOU: Yah. Owner was on the desk then, said these two guys had company.
MARGE: Oh, yah?
MARGE: Where you girls from?
HOOKER ONE: Chaska.
HOOKER TWO: LeSeure. But I went to high school in White Bear Lake.
MARGE: Okay, I want you to tell me what these fellas looked like.
HOOKER ONE: Well, the little guy, he was kinda funny-looking.
MARGE: In what way?
HOOKER ONE: I dunno. Just funny-looking.
MARGE: Can you be any more specific?
HOOKER ONE: I couldn't really say. He wasn't circumcised.
MARGE: Was he funny-looking apart from that?
HOOKER ONE: Yah.
MARGE: So you were having sex with the little fella, then?
HOOKER ONE: Uh-huh.
MARGE: Is there anything else you can tell me about him?
HOOKER ONE: No. Like I say, he was funny-looking. More'n most people even.
MARGE: And what about the other fella?
HOOKER TWO: He was a little older. Looked like the Marlboro man.
MARGE: Yah?
HOOKER TWO: Yah. Maybe I'm sayin' that cause he smoked Marlboros.
MARGE: Uh-huh.
HOOKER TWO: A subconscious-type thing.
MARGE: Yah, that can happen.
HOOKER TWO: Yah.
HOOKER ONE: They said they were goin' to the Twin Cities?
MARGE: Oh, yah?
