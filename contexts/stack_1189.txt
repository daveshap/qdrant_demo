Is there an open source PostgreSQL IDE that allows for model generation? I have done quite a lot of SQL Server work where I could use SSMS. Now I'm working with Postgres and I miss the ability to generate models (diagrams) from existing relations (taking into account relationships).I really like pgAdmin, but it looks like the designer is separate (pgDesigner) and old. I really like Navicat's designer, but it's quite expensive. What are the best options for postgres ER models that are open source/free?
