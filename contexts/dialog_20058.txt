BYRON: So what're you doing in Seattle?
ZACK: Get ready pard. This one's gonna blow you away.
BYRON: Zackie, nothing you do will ever surprise me, pard, not after some of the shit you've pulled.
ZACK: I joined the Navy.
BYRON: You... in the Navy?
ZACK: That's right. I'm on my way over to this officer school in Port Ranier.
BYRON: Why?
ZACK: To fly jets. To be the fastest motherfucker in the world. You gotta come and visit me. I'm only a couple hours away.
BYRON: Who gave you this idea?
ZACK: Nobody. It just came to me.
