NIXON: ... I don't really know you yet, Sandy ... What do you like? I mean, what kind of clothes do you like? Do you like blue ... red?
SANDY: Oh, I like satin, I like pink ...
NIXON: What kind of, uh ... music do you like?
SANDY: I like jazz ...
NIXON: Yeah ... Guy Lombardo ...
SANDY: Elvis I like, too.
NIXON: Oh yeah, he's good.
SANDY: ... but it depends on what I'm doing to the music, Dick ...
NIXON: Uh, is your mother ... still alive?
SANDY: Yeah, she lives in Dallas ...
NIXON: She must be very attractive. Would she like an autograph? She might remember me ... Where's Trini?
JONES: Hell, Kennedy's pissed Cuba away to the Russians. And he don't know what the hell he's doing in Vietnam. These are dangerous times, Dick, especially for business ...
NIXON: Agreed.
