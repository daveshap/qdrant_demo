GIRL #1: She was never attacked. I think she made it all up.
GIRL #2: Why would she lie about it?
GIRL #1: For attention. The girl has some serious issues.
GIRL #1: What if she did it? What if Sidney killed Casey and Steve?
GIRL #2: And why would she do that?
GIRL #1: Maybe she was hot for Steve and killed them both in a jealous rage.
GIRL #2: Why would Sidney want to be with Steve? She has her own bubble-butt boyfriend Billy.
GIRL #1: Maybe she's a slut just like her mom.
GIRL #2: You're evil.
GIRL #1: Please, it's common knowledge. Her mother was a trollop.
GIRL #2: Cut some slack. She watched her mom get butchered.
GIRL #1: And it fucked her up royally. Think about it. It makes perfect sense. Her mom's death leaves her distraught and hostile at a cruel and inhumane world, she's disillusioned, where's God, etc. Completely suicidal. And one day she snaps. She wants to kill herself but realizes teen suicide is out this year. And homicide is a much healthier therapeutic expression.
GIRL #2: Where do you get this shit?
GIRL #1: Ricki Lake.
