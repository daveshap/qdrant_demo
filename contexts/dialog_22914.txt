LLOYD: Hi. Lloyd Dobler, sir. Pleasure to meet you.
JIM: Hello Lloyd.
LLOYD: Hello. Heard about that graduation present. Really quite a car. Look, I know you're busy, you don't' have to retain me, but you can trust me. I'll tell you a couple of things about myself, I'm nineteen, been overseas for a couple of semesters, but now I'm back. I'm an athlete, so I rarely drink. Kickboxing. You heard of kickboxing, sport of the future? Don 'The Dragon' Wilson, Lenny [?] merciless, one of the champions of the sport? I can see by your face, no. My point is, you can relax because your daughter will be safe with me for the next seven to eight hours.
JIM: Fine Lloyd.
LLOYD: How ya doing? Is she around?
JIM: Yeah. Honey?
LLOYD: Whoa.
DIANE: Would you hold this for me?
LLOYD: Yeah
DIANE: What are these?
LLOYD: They're Bavarian Death style pretzels.
DIANE: Oh. Um, would it be terrible if I wanted to go home early?
LLOYD: No.
