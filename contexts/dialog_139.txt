KORFIN: You see Eddie's face when I gave him the timer? Wish I had a picture of it.
JORDY: He knew all along.
KORFIN: What??
JORDY: That's why he was so quiet. He was testing us.
NICOLETTE: Detective, does it look like a murder?
EDDIE: We don't know that yet. It's much too early. There's a lot to be done.
NICOLETTE: How many victims are up there?
EDDIE: There are two bodies found at this point.
NICOLETTE: Can we go up to the crime scene?
EDDIE: You know you can't do that. C'mon.
NICOLETTE: Is it drug related?
EDDIE: We don't know. When I have more I'll let you know.
