DIGNAN: Future Man would never go to jail for you, I'll tell you that.
BOB: His name's not Future Man, Dignan.
DIGNAN: I know it's not.
BOB: You don't even know his name.
DIGNAN: Yes, I do.
BOB: What is it?
DIGNAN: Just get in the car, Bob.
BOB: What's his name?
DIGNAN: OK, Bob. I don't know his name. You know why? Because I don't care. He's Future Man. But I care about you. And to me it doesn't make sense to go back to the scene of a crime. Will you get in the car, Bob? This is stupid.
BOB: It's not your decision and he's not your brother, Dignan.
DIGNAN: That's right. I only have one vote. We'll go talk with Anthony and figure it out.
