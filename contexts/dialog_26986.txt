CHRISTINE: What do you think you're doing?
NICHOLAS: You tell me... I want to know who's behind this. Who did this to me... how, why... ?
CHRISTINE: How deluded can you be? There's no <u>why</u>...
NICHOLAS: Who's responsible?!
CHRISTINE: It wasn't you. It wasn't personal...
NICHOLAS: You call them...
CHRISTINE: It could have been any asshole with a couple hundred million in the bank.
NICHOLAS: Call them, tell them to get the boss up here. Tell them I'll kill you...
CHRISTINE: They won't...
NICHOLAS: They will! You tell them if they don't come now, I will shoot you!
