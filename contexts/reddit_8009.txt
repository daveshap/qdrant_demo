Scholarships/grants for Professionals/Part Time Students
Hello All! 

So I am thinking about starting graduate school very soon. I'll be going for a Masters in Systems Engineering. 

My company does pay up front for classes for degrees. However they recently changed the policy and the amount they will support. With the new financial cap from the company it would only cover enough for me to take 2 classes per year, if I go to the university of my choice. Personally that's not ideal for me because it would take me about 5 years to finish the program. Then I would owe the company 2 years after that. I would like to take at least 2 classes a semester which would be 4 classes a year. 

Of course I am looking into programs that are a more affordable but I was wondering if anyone knew of any scholarships or grants or programs that will support part time professional students. That would help a lot to cover the extra cost so I can finish my program in a decent time frame. 

Thanks in advance for the help!
