I just learned that is you have a valid Medicaid or gov't. benefits EBT card, you can get discount Amazon Prime.
It's $5.99 a month if you have that proof.

That's pretty cool for them to do that. So many businesses typically soak the poor for every dime they can get. 

I know - even $6 a month can be too much sometimes.
