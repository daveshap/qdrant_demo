I don’t know how to tell my dentist I haven’t been brushing my teeth.
I’ve been in a depressive episode for a while now. I haven’t been brushing my teeth. I’m constantly ashamed and anxious about it. I’m an adult. And I have been putting off going to my cleaning. I have to do it in a couple of days and I always tell myself I’ll start before then but I don’t. 

I don’t know what to say. I am so embarrassed. Has anyone else done anything like this? I would feel better just knowing other people have gone through it and how they handled it. Thanks guys.
