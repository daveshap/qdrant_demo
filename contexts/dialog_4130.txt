ESCOBAR: George, you look terrible.
GEORGE: Yeah, well...
ESCOBAR: Diego?
GEORGE: Yeah.
ESCOBAR: Please. Sit down. We'll drink some scotch.
GEORGE: I didn't come here to drink scotch.
ESCOBAR: I see. I'm sorry about this, George. I'm not happy about this situation. It's bad. You now know who your Brutus is.
GEORGE: You know why I'm here. You know what I have to do. I came here for permission. Out of respect, Pablo. This is bullshit, he's making me look like a punk.
ESCOBAR: It is very difficult. Diego makes me a lot of money. If Diego goes so does the money. You were an excellent teacher, George. When the student has learned well, the teacher is no longer necessary. We must remember we have wives, friends, familia. Even familia that has not been born. But sometimes, we must forget as well. I am like you. I must teach the lesson. We want to teach the lesson. But we cannot. We must remember that life is the teacher.
GEORGE: You're saying life will take care of Diego?
ESCOBAR: Life will take care of everybody. Diego, me, you. It is the teacher.
GEORGE: I get it. I'm really pissed, Pablo. You know the DEA knows about Norman's Cay. For Chrissakes, Diego worships Adolf Hitler and John Lennon, that's fucked up!
ESCOBAR: I'm sorry, George.
GEORGE: Yeah, well, what are you gonna do? You and me, Pablo? Are we good?
ESCOBAR: Of course, George. We are beautiful. We are brothers. Real brothers. Not like Diego. We started this, George.
