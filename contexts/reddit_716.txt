My parents won't believe me. I'm innocent!
My dad thinks I got into the the Christmas presents because one package was wide open and boxes were knocked over. I 100% swear that it was not me at all! Also it couldn't have been my brother because he was at school. Anybody know a way I can get them to believe it? Again I am not lying, I didn't tamper with any packages at all! This is actually kind of creeping me out!
