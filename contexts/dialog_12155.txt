VON KONIGSWALD: Aha! Hello! You're Mildred, right?
MILDRED: I heard you were looking for me.
VON KONIGSWALD: You were Harold Ryan's third wife. Right?
MILDRED: Yes.
VON KONIGSWALD: You want to join the Harold Ryan Fan Club? Wear a pink jacket with a yellow streak up the back?
MILDRED: Do I have to? Who's the little girl?
WANDA JUNE: Mr. Ryan just borrowed my birthday cake. I don't really know him.
MILDRED: Thought you were another wife, maybe.
WANDA JUNE: I'm only ten years old.
MILDRED: That's what he wanted--a ten-year- old wife. He'd come home from a war or a safari, and he'd wind up talking to the little kids.
WANDA JUNE: Won't you please join our club? Please?
MILDRED: Honey--Alcoholics Anonymous takes all the time I've got--and Harold Ryan is an individual I would rather forget. He drove me to drink. He drove his first two wives to drink.
VON KONIGSWALD: Because he was cruel?
MILDRED: Premature ejaculation.
VON KONIGSWALD: Ach soooooooooo. MILDRED No grown woman is a fan of premature ejaculation. Harold would come home trumpeting and roaring. He would the kick the furniture with his boots, spit into corners and the fireplace. He would make me presents of stuffed fish and helmets with holes in them. He would tell me that he had now earned the reward that only a woman could give him, and he'd tear off my clothes. He would carry me into the bedroom, telling me to scream and kick my feet. That was very important to him. I did it. I tried to be a good wife. He told me to imagine a herd of stampeding water buffalo. I couldn't do that, but I pretended I did. It was all over--ten seconds after he'd said the word buffalo." Then he'd zip up his pants
VON KONIGSWALD: That is sad.
MILDRED: Is it? I have this theory about why men kill each other and break things.
VON KONIGSWALD: Ja?
MILDRED: Never mind. It's a dumb theory. I was going to say it was all sexual..but everything is sexual...but alcohol. Peace.
