HYPNOS: Sorry, Steve, maybe next time. And how's our new guest settling in - ?
STU: YOU SET ME UP!!
HYPNOS: Easy, pal! I was coming to congratulate you. It ain't easy snatching one of those E-tickets. Steve here was the last guy to pull it off, and that musta been, what, 25 years ago...?
STU: Why'd you do it? What'd I ever do to you?!?
HYPNOS: It's simple, Stu. We need nightmares - lots of 'em. So whenever we can swing it, we send a guy up to stimulate the flow...a <u>nightmare maker</u>! Like Steve here. Poe. Rasputin...we've been doing this all the way back to Atilla and Genghis Khan!
STU: But <u>why me</u>? Why'd you pick on <u>me</u>??
HYPNOS: The monkey, of course. It was his idea.
STU: Monkeybone...!?
HYPNOS: Nobody wants to be a sidekick, Stu. So one day he comes to us - he's got a proposition. We help him get your body...in return he gives us all the nightmares we want.
STU: You're nuts! I'm a comic strip artist! What's he gonna do - draw <u>really scary cartoons</u>??
HYPNOS: Oh, no, no, no. Y'see, Stu, as it happens, that girlfriend of yours figured out the chemical basis of bad dreams. And she just whipped up a big old batch of nightmare juice!
