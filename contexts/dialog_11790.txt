NORM: Security, uh Norm, Norm speaking.
DADE: Norman? This is Mr. Eddie Vedder, from Accounting. I just had a power surge here at home that wiped out a file I was working on. Listen, I'm in big trouble, do you know anything about computers?
NORM: Uhhmmm... uh gee, uh...
DADE: Right, well my BLT drive on my computer just went AWOL, and I've got this big project due tomorrow for Mr. Kawasaki, and if I don't get it in, he's gonna ask me to commit Hari Kari...
NORM: Uhhh.. ahahaha...
DADE: Yeah, well, you know these Japanese management techniques. Could you, uh, read me the number on the modem?
NORM: Uhhhmm...
DADE: It's a little boxy thing, Norm, with switches on it... lets my computer talk to the one there...
