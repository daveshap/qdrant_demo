I have been diagnosed with PTSD and depression .... warning this is very very dark
Ik this will be a waste of everyones time but even if no one reads this I need to write it down....I'm 14 now....back years and years ago when I was 4 my eldest sister  raped my 4 year old self  she had mental issues...she started cutting me with knives and making me watch her cut her self.....she continued this till I was 9...that's when she finally moved out of my family's house...she had drilled it into my brain that what she did to me was "notmal" and if I told my parents or other siblings  she would murder them...so I never told anyone....not until a month ago current time... after my sister left the house she still kept in touch with my parents....my parents constantly made me visit my sister which brought the memories back...my sister hadnt changed she'd threaten me any chance she got...I started feeling so so depressed. And on top of that my father started...acting worse....he used to be so nice but I think the stress of my sister (they knew she had mental issues just not what she'd do) I think the stress kinda broke him... I felt like I'd lost my family around that time I was barely coping but then something worse happend.... my hands started going numb...I started having flashbacks...of a sort....dreams I was sleep walking...slowly but over a course of a few months I'd lost almost all feeling in my hands and started getting dizzy...my hands started hurting and I started getting sick more often...and every time I'd get sick my whole body would go numb...not even figureitivly my body REALLY was going numb... soon things became progressively worse and my parents took. Me to doctors  after doctors....they all did tons of tests on me but couldn't pinpoint anything...in the end they ended up just saying  welp we dunno but I guess you'll end up calling it fiber myalgia... a while after that my condition had worsened so much I decided to quit ice skating...one of my favorite sports because it was to painful for me...and since I'm homeschooled that was one of the few places I had friends...I started losing touch with them... I was in and out of hospitals for a number of things...each one being mostly untreatable...my other sister (not the one who raped me) my other sister said I made my problems out to be bigger then they were...I found out that if I DIDN'T speak up about anything they'd worry and see just how much I had trouble...so I stopped talking I continued trying to handle everything myself I kept the thing that happend in my childhood a complete secret....no one knew... it was eating away at me...I had almost no friends I was  depressed  and in pain 24/7... my parents sensed I was depressed and they tried to tell me it was a "side effect " of my condition. Which made me feel as though they were saying my feelings weren't my feelingss...  it built up...then one day on my birthday my parents invited my eldest sister to the house.... when she arrived she was visibly pregnant...none of us had known... she  had all the attention on her the whole day and I kept worrying how she'd parent the child when she was so cold hearted...  she told me that day that she would no longer harm me...because when the baby arrived it would be her new play thing she said.... I felt sick               to the stomach it was my 14th birthday and that was the day I attempted to end my own life... I had left a letter explaining everything about my sister to my mother and other sister... I had left that letter knowing they'd save that little baby from my sister...then I let go and tried to die...I felt so sad..all my life I looked toward the future with bright eyes...and I had decided in one moment I couldn't continue farther....turns out my parents had invited one of my last  friends over to surprise me...he was the one that walked in and found me nearly dead...when my parents saw me I'll never forget how my mothers face looked or how uncaring my father looked. They rushed me to the hospital  and I obviously lived or I wouldn't be typing this..  I still feel depressed but really dont want to die...but I am having trouble finding a reason to live... my mother is the only one who ever found and read the letter so she and I talked about my sister...my mother loves my sister very much and had a hard time with it...another reason why I didn't tell anyone... she just had no idea that was going on... my sister  dropped contact with my family and fell of the radar...I assume my mother had something to do with that... the baby? Well my sister had a miscarriage only a couple days ago...around the time she fell out of touch... I haven't pressed charges on my sister..I just can't get myself to do it... I know this is probably the lamest stuff to be depressed about but I honestly don't want to go to counseling where someone is PAID to care... I feel depressed like any other 14 yr old I guess.  And I don't see a future for me anymore... I'm sorry this was long and I'm sorry if I wasted your time. I just needed to type I guess....
