HENDRICKS: I can't let you take her out.
BRODY: You can't stop me.
HENDRICKS: Mrs. Brody, look -- if he can't go, then you can't go. Neither of you can go.
ELLEN: I'm going.
BRODY: Mike's out there.
HENDRICKS: But I signed for the boat. You' re not authorized any more.
BRODY: Untie that rope.
HENDRICKS: Please. It's my job.
