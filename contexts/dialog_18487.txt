BABE: Good night.
BABE: Mabel, that guy's either the dumbest, the stupidest, the most imbecilic idiot in the world - or he's the grandest thing alive. I can't make him out.
MABEL: Uh-huh.
BABE: I'm crucifying him.
MABEL: People have been crucified before.
BABE: Why? Why do we have to do it?
MABEL: You started out to be a successful newspaper woman, didn't you?
BABE: Yeah, then what?
MABEL: Search me. Ask the Gypsies.
BABE: Here's a guy that's wholesome and fresh. To us he looks like a freak. You know what he told me tonight? He said when he gets married he wants to carry his bride over the threshold in his arms.
MABEL: The guy's balmy.
BABE: Is he? Yeah, I thought so, too. I tried to laugh, but I couldn't. It stuck in my throat.
MABEL: Aw, cut it out, will you? You'll get me thinking about Charlie again.
BABE: He's got goodness, Mabel. Do you know what that is?
MABEL: Huh?
BABE: No - of course you don't. We've forgotten. We're too busy being smart-alecks. Too busy in a crazy competition for nothing.
