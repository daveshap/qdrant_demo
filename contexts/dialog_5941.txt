CANDY: Wally thinks apples are boring.
WALLY: I never said they were boring.
CANDY: You said, Apples aren't exactly flying.""
WALLY: Well, they aren't.
HOMER: I think I'd probably like the apple business.
WALLY: You're a little overqualified, aren't you?
HOMER: No, I'm not. I need a job.
WALLY: The only jobs are picking jobs. Picking apples is truly boring.
CANDY: There! You said it was boring.
WALLY: Well, *picking* them is! It's about as exciting as... walking!
HOMER: Is your family in the apple business, too?
CANDY: No, but I work there--I like it. My dad's a lobsterman.
HOMER: I've never seen a lobster.
CANDY: Really?
HOMER: I've never seen the ocean, either.
