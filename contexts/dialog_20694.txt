JUD: Do you know what this place is, Ellie? Oh, I know you know it's a boneyard, but a bone ain't nothing and even a whole pile of 'em don't amount to much. Do you know what a graveyard really is?
ELLIE: Well...I guess not.
JUD: It's a place where the dead speak, Missy.
JUD: No--not right out loud. Their stones speak...or their markers. Even if the marker ain't nothing but a tin can someone wrote on with a Magic Marker, it speaks. Ain't that so, Louis?
LOUIS: I think it is so, Ellie.
ELLIE: What if you can't read what's written on there anymore?
JUD: Well, it still says some animal got laid down here after, don't it?
ELLIE: Yes--
LOUIS: And that someone cared enough about that animal to mark the spot.
ELLIE: To remember.
