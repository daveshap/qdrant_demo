How much is a 10 day trip ticket Rahway to Penn Station How much is a 10 day trip ticket Rahway to Penn Station? I saw that there are 10 trip one way tickets so I guess you get a good discount.Actually I have to travel from Rahway to Penn Station and then take subway near Wellington hotel station. This is because hotels are terrible expensive and have to stay 10 days in NY so I want to see how much I can save by staying in a hotel near Rahway station in New Jersey.Thanks a lot
