Probation period extended. Advice needed.
Hi All,

I am graduate chemical engineer whose just started working in the last three months. The company I work for has started a new office in my country (1 year old) and within the company and I am there first graduate engineer. I have only met my in line manager once in the last three months for face to face work or discussion ( the guy who is responsible for me - he is very busy I joined at a time when the current project we are working for is ending). During the job I was working mainly in autocad which they give training for. The problem lies in the fact that I was never able to showcase my technical skill (chemical engineering knowledge) an this appears to be the main reason why they are extending my probabtion period. Should I be worried? Any advice? Tips?
