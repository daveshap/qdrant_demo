JOEY: You got it, Verona. I pick up the tab, you do the honors.
PATRICK: You're gonna pay me to take out some girl?
JOEY: I can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend. And that's the catch. She doesn't want a boyfriend.
PATRICK: How much?
PATRICK: I can't take a girl like that out on twenty bucks.
JOEY: Fine, thirty.
JOEY: Take it or leave it. This isn't a negotiation.
PATRICK: Fifty, and you've got your man.
