MAGGIE: He's not coming. Watch. He's not coming.
PEGGY: No, no. I saw eight geese flying in a V"."
MAGGIE: You and your lucky geese. You always see geese.
PEGGY: Not eight...
CINDY: And in a V"."
MAGGIE: Eight is good... V" could be Victory."
CINDY: Rub your ears.
PEGGY: Yes, rubbing your ears is very soothing. Cory does that to me when I hyperventilate.
CINDY: We do it to our dog.
MAGGIE: It's hurting.
CINDY: We'll rub.
