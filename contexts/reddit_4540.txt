No one remember my birthday
I have been living closed for 5 years and i have always turned off my birthday because i really shy when it come to my birthday.People keep asking me what will i do on my birthday but in reality it just like all my normal day. But this year i finally come out of my shell. Im trying my best for my goal. Today i left my birthday turn on, but i waited all day not even a single happy birthday wish posted on my facebook,maybe they dont remember me at all. I'm just sad when realize after all these time isolated myself that i am nobody. I just want to share my story here with you guys.

I'm sorry this might  not be the subreddit for the sad one like me but i couldnt find a place to share with someone
