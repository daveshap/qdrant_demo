How much money to budget for the very beginning of graduate school?
I’m currently working a gap year job while applying to Neuroscience PhD programs. I have already budgeted ~$1200 for all the costs associated with applications, and now I am trying to figure out how much money I need to set aside for actually starting graduate school. This could include things like moving costs, apartment security deposit, supporting myself while I await my first paycheck, etc. For reference I will most likely end up in a fairly pricey city (Boston, San Diego, etc.) and I will be living with my fiancé, who may or may not have a job lined up by that point. It’s possible that I could be supporting both of us for a little while until he finds work. 

Would anyone be willing to share how much they spent up-front when starting graduate school?
