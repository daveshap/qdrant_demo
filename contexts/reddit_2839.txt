What are the best career aptitude tests?
Iâ€™m looking for some tests that can help me define what I want in a career and what type of job I would suit. I already know my MBTI, Enneagram, and have taken the Strengthsfinder. Any suggestions for others I should look at?  Bonus points if they can be taken for free.
