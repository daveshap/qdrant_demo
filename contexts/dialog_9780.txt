FLETCH: You can't keep me here.
CUMMINGS: Maybe I'm not going to keep you here. Maybe I'm gonna blow your brains out.
FLETCH: I'm no lawyer, but I do believe that's a violation of my rights.
CUMMINGS: After I shoot you, I stick the knife in my arm, then place it in your dead hand. Self-defense. We don't do this very much anymore... but we have. Got rid of a lot of minorities that way.
FLETCH: My God, you're serious.
CUMMINGS: Ask anybody.
FLETCH: Can I ask anybody now?
FLETCH: Can I call my Mom? I'd like to tell here how much I've always loved her.
CUMMINGS: What'll it be Fletch?
FLETCH: I hate the beach. Wouldn't go there if you paid me. Besides, I'm way overdue on my story about off-track betting in the Himalayas. You don't think it's the mafia, do you?
CUMMINGS: Its been very nice meeting you. I enjoy your column.
CUMMINGS: Speaking of which, you're not going to print anything before my investigation is through, are you?
FLETCH: Not a prayer.
CUMMINGS: That a boy.
CUMMINGS: Thanks for coming down to see us.
FLETCH: Not at all, Chief. But next time... no tongue, okay?
FLETCH: How could you call him?
WALKER: It's called journalism, Fletch. It's called getting both sides of the story. Something you apparently don't know anything about.
FLETCH: It's also called getting me this close to being murdered.
WALKER: Get out of here.
FLETCH: He threw me in a cell, took a gun and a knife and threatened to kill me right there if I didn't promise to give up the story.
WALKER: You know, I've had it up to here with your bullshit. I need a story from you by tomorrow.
FLETCH: You'll have it.
WALKER: But not unsubstantiated charges about dope-dealing cops, and not horse shit paranoid fantasies about homicidal police chiefs.
FLETCH: Thanks for the vote of confidence, Frank.
WALKER: I want something I can print!
FLETCH: Print this Frank.
FLETCH: Hi, where's Mrs. Stanwyk?
WAITER: In her cabana, sir.
FLETCH: Oh, that's right. She told me to meet her there. That's cabana six?
WAITER: Cabana one.
FLETCH: One.
WAITER: Would you be caring for something to eat or drink, sir?
FLETCH: I would, actually.
WAITER: Charged to the Underhills, sir?
FLETCH: Right. Tell you what -- have you caviar?
WAITER: Yes, sir. Beluga. But it is eighty dollars the portion.
FLETCH: I'd better only get two. How about the lobster thermidor?
WAITER: I recommend it.
FLETCH: Fine. And a couple of bottles of Dom Perignon. To cabana one.
WAITER: Very good, sir.
