SHEILA: Mind if I cut in?
THEO: No, not at all.
SHEILA: You and your sideburns are the talk of the party, Theo.
THEO: The ladies in Akron call them thigh- ticklers.
SHEILA: Can I ask you something personal?
THEO: I'd rather you didn't.
SHEILA: Do you have a girlfriend?
THEO: Not while I'm in training.
SHEILA: Do you have a boyfriend?
THEO: No. Do You?
SHEILA: No. Not at the present.
THEO: So this brother of yours is hazardous to the health of your dates?
SHEILA: Nobody in this town really understands Junior. When I went to family sessions for him I realized he was the sanest one in the family. Actually, he's the only one in this whole fucking town who knows exactly who he is and what he wants.
THEO: Unfortunately what he wants is you.
SHEILA: So, what about you?
THEO: Do I want you?
SHEILA: We'll get into that later.
