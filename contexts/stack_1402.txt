Grounding conductor meant to protect electrical devices? I had a home inspection performed on an old house recently. The inspector noticed that some of the outlets had an unconnected third prong. He told me that the absence of a grounding conductor on the outlet wouldn't cause any harm to the home's electrical system itself, but that modern appliances that are designed to work with a 3-prong outlet could be damaged if the grounding conductor is unconnected. He used an example of a television set and mentioned that the t.v. could be fried by an unexpected voltage transient from the grid, and then mentioned something about currents travelling in the wrong direction.I didn't feel like starting an argument so I didn't press him on this issue, but what he was saying sounded completely bogus to me. I thought the grounding conductor was meant to protect the device user from harm, not the device itself? However, he seemed like a pretty competent guy, so I'm wondering if there's actually any truth to his claims?
