Creating Engaging Social Media Platforms
Hi all! I'll be running the social media for the Career Center at my institution for the next year and I'm wondering what tips/tricks you have to make it really engaging and informative. I'll be running an Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn account, but I think most of the focus will be on Instagram/Facebook. 

Also, what are some good websites with career resources that we could be sharing?
