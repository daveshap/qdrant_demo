PETER: I don't understand what's going on.
MAYA: There's no reason why you should. This has been planned from your birth. You fit all the criteria that we know of. Never baptized, born of incest, devoid of faith...
PETER: But I was baptized. And I certainly wasn't born of incest.
MAYA: You were not baptized. At least I don't believe it was Christian. Your baptism was performed by your uncle, James McKenzie.
PETER: Yes, I know.
MAYA: The only baptism he ever performed in seven years as pastor at Bedford.
PETER: So what?
MAYA: Seven years. One baptism? He's your mother's only brother
PETER: Yes.
MAYA: Do you know your parents' blood types?
PETER: I looked at the coroner's report. My father's O positive and my mother...A negative.
MAYA: Peter, your blood-type is AB negative. There's no way your birth father can be O positive. You father is not who you think he is.
PETER: So...then the coroner's report is probably wrong. I mean...this is ridiculous. There's been a mistake. I don't believe any of this.
MAYA: Then why are you here?
MAYA: Peter, I believe your baptism was perverted. Look at your certificate. Your mother was the only witness to it. Your blood-type doesn't match who you thought your father was. Peter...I'm sorry.
PETER: And if what you're saying is true, what would happen to me?
MAYA: I don't know. I do know that people who are possessed have to accept evil in some way. I don't know if it works the same way in this instance. I don't even know when it's going to happen.
PETER: When Townsend tried to kill me, he said something strange like... The time of transformation is near...""
MAYA: Townsend, he had some of Father's books.
