JOE: How 'you doin' man?
DUFF: Okay.
JOE: Cup of coffee. I 'been meanin' to talk to you.
DUFF: Oh yeah?
JOE: You know, over at the mill, there's just one guy that talked. It's kinda late to say it, but we shoulda acted different.
JOE: Been over to the other mill?
DUFF: Yeah, I been there.
JOE: It's just that we're not used to seein' anyone stand up 'round here. Kinda took us by surprise.
DUFF: Oh yeah? That's good.
