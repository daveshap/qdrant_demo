BEN: Darth Vader is on this system. I can feel him. I can feel the Kiber Crystal.
HAN: Is that good or bad?
BEN: It's not good... unless I could find the Crystal. Then it could be very good.
LUKE: What about the princess?
BEN: You go after the princess. I am an old man and would be of little help. I must try to find the Crystal.
LUKE: I'm not going alone!
HAN: Don't look at me. I'm just a pilot. I got you here... You've got to do the rest.
BEN: There is a greater risk in staying here, you know. If you don't find the princess, then the whole trip was for nothing... wasn't it?
HAN: I'm not going out there.
