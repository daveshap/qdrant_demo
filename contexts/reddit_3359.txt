chicks chasing me
So I got chased by a chicken on my bike yesterday.... At least I can say I have some chicks chasing me right?

Edit: so i realize this may be in the wrong sub but I think it might be a breath of fresh air to people coming here about being ghosted, rejected, or overthinking things... The big thing is just do you itll come together in time.   I mean I'm in the same boat but after this happening and the irony behind it, I just had to share.
