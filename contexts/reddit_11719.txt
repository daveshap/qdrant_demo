I miss home.
I just flew over 900 miles to visit my mom for 2 weeks. I skipped the last week of school just to have some extra time with her, but now that I'm here I just want to go home. I miss home and it's becoming unbearable. I've never missed home this much in my life, and Im gone for months at a time sometimes. I've been here for 3 days. don't know how or if I should tell my mom. I haven't seen her in months and she's so stoked that I'm here, she would be heartbroken. But I don't want to spend the next 10 days in sadness. Usually I don't let it effect my attitude but it's beginning to cripple me. I just came home to cry. I don't know what to do.
