Rough first day and how to bounce back.
Hey so I started my job today at a startup doing customer support. I initially thought the induction or training would be present, unfortunately I sat quietly struggling, this is my first startup role and first customer support role so I’m struggling on the information overload. I feel like I seriously flopped today, my manager joked about how quiet I was during the day... I’m lacking on my self esteem and don’t know how to bounce back, the company is really  progressive and I’d like to show I’m a worthwhile employee before my probation ends. Help!?
