Does anyone else find that they talk to themselves A LOT in their head when they’re feeling anxious?
I don’t know if it’s just me but whenever I’m feeling super anxious I seem to have full on conversations with myself in my head and just lots of thoughts come in and out of my head. Am I going crazy or is this a normal thing that happens with everyone who has anxiety?
