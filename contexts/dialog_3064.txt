JULIE: Make a choice, Bruce. Her or me.
BRUCE: Well...um...her.
JULIE: You were right. I get it. You're not the marrying kind. You've made your point. Goodbye Bruce Wayne.
PAMELA: Physical perfection, charm and wealth tossed over for a dowdy spinster. How do you explain your behavior?
BRUCE: I can't. But perhaps tonight, over dinner...I've just had an opening.
PAMELA: Maybe your witless playboy persona works on every bimbo du jour but I am not the least bit titillated by your attentions. So back off or I'll have you in court quicker than you can spell sexual harassment. Got me?
