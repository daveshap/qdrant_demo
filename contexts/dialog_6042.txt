BERNSTEIN: Miss Susan Alexander
KANE: Thais.
BERNSTEIN: Her singing
KANE: Go on!
BERNSTEIN: That's all there is.
KANE: Of her acting, it is absolutely impossible to say anything except that it represents a new low... Have you got that, Mr. Bernstein? In the opinion of this reviewer -
BERNSTEIN: I didn't see that.
KANE: It isn't here, Mr. Bernstein. I'm dictating it.
BERNSTEIN: I can't take shorthand.
KANE: Get me a typewriter. I'll finish the notice.
BERNSTEIN: He finished it. He wrote the worst notice I ever read about the girl he loved. We ran it in every paper.
THOMPSON: I guess Mr. Kane didn't think so well of Susie's art anyway.
BERNSTEIN: He thought she was great, Mr. Thompson. He really believed that. He put all his ambition on that girl. After she came along, he never really cared for himself like he used to. Oh, I don't blame Susie -
THOMPSON: Well, then, how could he write that roast? The notices in the Kane papers were always very kind to her.
BERNSTEIN: Oh, yes. He saw to that. I tell you, Mr. Thompson, he was a hard man to figure out. He had that funny sense of humor. And then, too, maybe he thought by finishing that piece he could show Leland he was an honest man. You see, Leland didn't think so. I guess he showed him all right. He's a nice fellow, but he's a dreamer. They were always together in those early days when we just started the Enquirer.
CARTER: Welcome, Mr. Kane, to the Enquirer." I am Herbert Carter."
KANE: Thank you, Mr Carter. This is Mr. Leland.
CARTER: How do you do, Mr. Leland?
KANE: Are they standing for me?
CARTER: I thought it would be a nice gesture - the new publisher -
KANE: Ask them to sit down.
CARTER: You may resume your work, gentlemen. I didn't know your plans and so I was unable to make any preparations.
KANE: I don't my plans myself.
