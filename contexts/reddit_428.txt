Best friend second guesses
I am struggling with anxiety and my best friend has been with me all the way but lately we haven’t been speaking. I have asked her time and time again if she wants to stay over but she always cancelles last minute. I am starting to get the feeling that she doesn’t like me anymore and I being stupid or not please I want honest answers
