LOUIS: How much is there?
ORDELL: Over half-million dollars worth of merchandise.
LOUIS: Can I ask you about Melanie?
ORDELL: Sure.
LOUIS: What's your relationship?
ORDELL: She one of the women I got set up. I got Melanie in Hermosa Beach. I rent Simone a small house in Compton, and about four blocks away I got me this nineteen-year-old country girl named Sheronda. I found her waitin' for a bus two days outta Alabama, barefoot, country as a chicken coop. Took her to my house in Compton, told her it was Hollywood.
LOUIS: She believed you?
ORDELL: Hell, yeah. To her dumb country ass, Compton is Hollywood. Close as she's ever been, anyway.
