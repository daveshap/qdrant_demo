PETER: Hello, Joe. Sorry. Just a little gag of mine. Thought I'd have some fun with you.
GORDON: Yeah. Sure. Had me going for a while.
PETER: Wouldn't have made a bad story, would it?
GORDON: Great! But that's the way things go. You think you got a swell yarn—then something comes along—messes up the finish—and there you are.
PETER: Yeah, where am I?
GORDON: When you sober up—come in and see me.
PETER: Thanks, Joe.
