GEORGE: Hello, Mary. I just happened to be passing by.
MARY: Yeah, so I noticed. Have you made up your mind?
GEORGE: How's that?
MARY: Have you made up your mind?
GEORGE: About what?
MARY: About coming in. Your mother just phoned and said you were on your way over to pay me a visit.
GEORGE: My mother just called you? Well, how did she know?
MARY: Didn't you tell her?
GEORGE: I didn't tell anybody. I just went for a walk and happened to be passing by . . .
