Why do employers use BCD Travel for bookings? Why do employers require booking through an agent such as BCD Travel?  It seems like such a waste of money at $45 per booking, even for something simple like a rental car.  Are they getting a discount or kickback?  Is there really a savings to the employer in the end?
