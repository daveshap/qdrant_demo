Can I connect a 16 ohm output signal to a line input if I use a resistor in series? newbie here.I have a Hi-Fi system and I wish to connect its output to a line input in another system while still being able to hear through the Hi-Fi\u00b4s original speakers.If I use the Headphone jack, the speakers will be muted, but my sistem has an extra output meant for \"surround\" speakers. It specifies that this output is for 16 ohm speakers.My question is: If I wanted to use this output as a \"line  level\would it sufice to use resistors in series to rise the impedance to around 47KOhm? or is there a more efficient way of converting this low impedance output to line level?I should add that I do not wish to tap the audio output from the integrated circuit as this is for the moment beyond my ability as I am a complete noob in electronics (but I do not discard the possibility of doing this in the future).
