How often should I continue to keep in contact with my recruiter 2 months before start date?
I was given a start date in  early June and want to know how often should I continue to keep in contact with my recruiter. Given the current global pandemic circumstances and peopleâ€™s offer being rescinded, I want to be in contact as much as posible but not be too intrusive. Aside from that, what questions should I also be asking?
