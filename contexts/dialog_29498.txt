UHURA: Bad news, gentlemen. Shore leave's been cancelled.
CHEKOV: Rescued at last.
UHURA: Return to prearranged coordinates for pickup.
CHEKOV: Don't tell them you're lost. You'll never live it down.
UHURA: Is there a problem, gentlemen?
SULU: Um... yes. We've been caught in a blizzard!
CHEKOV: And we can't see a thing. Request you direct us to the coordinates.
UHURA: My visual says sunny skies and seventy degrees.
CHEKOV: Sulu! Look! The sun's come out! It's a miracle!
UHURA: Don't worry, fellas. Your secret's` safe with me. I'll send the shuttlecraft to pick you up.
