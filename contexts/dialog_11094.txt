DAVID: She tells me you haven't been sleeping well.
WHALE: It's the ridiculous pills they prescribe. If I take them, I spend the next day stupid as a stone. If I don't, my mind seems to go off in a hundred directions at once --
DAVID: Then take the pills.
WHALE: I wanted to be alert for your visit today. Especially since I saw so little of you in the hospital.
DAVID: I'm sorry, Jimmy. But with this movie and two difficult stars --
WHALE: The fault
DAVID: You remember how a production eats up one's life.
WHALE: Oh, David. There's no pleasure in making you feel guilty. You better go, my boy. You'll be late for that aeroplane.
DAVID: By the way, I like the Renoir.
WHALE: Thank you.
DAVID: Goodbye, Hanna.
