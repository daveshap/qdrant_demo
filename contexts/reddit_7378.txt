Interviewing tomorrow with Uniqlo, has anyone ever worked for them?
I am loosing my job in two weeks due to my workplace going out of business so I have to find a job quick. I saw the local Uniqlo store is hiring so I applied and have a "first round" interview with them tomorrow. I have worked retail before and have had a few jobs so I was wondering if anyone here has worked for them and if it's any better than the average retail job? This isnt my first interview by any means but I like to be prepared so what can I expect in the interview? Also what is the dress code like? Do I have to wear only Uniqlo brands or something (totally fine with that). 

Any and all advice is appreciated thanks!
