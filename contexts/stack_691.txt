pros and cons in installing ubuntu alongside windows boot manager I'm trying to dual boot my laptop, I know already on how to install it. Some tutorial I watch is they prefer to use \"something else\" than installing ubuntu alongside windows boot manager. I'm confuse now what are the pros and cons if I choose ubuntu alongside windows boot manager. I create a partition in my hard drive. I want my ubuntu install it in other partition but I want also to choose the option ubuntu alongside windows bootsmanager. Is this possible? and Is it safe to choose that option?
