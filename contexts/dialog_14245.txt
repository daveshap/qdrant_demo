CLARENCE: That's what I was sent down for. I'm your guardian angel.
GEORGE: I wouldn't be a bit surprised.
CLARENCE: Ridiculous of you to think of killing yourself for money. Eight thousand dollars.
CLARENCE: I told you –– I'm your guardian angel. I know everything about you.
GEORGE: Well, you look about like the kind of an angel I'd get. Sort of a fallen angel, aren't you? What happened to your wings?
CLARENCE: I haven't won my wings yet. That's why I'm an angel Second Class.
GEORGE: I don't know whether I like it very much being seen around with an angel without any wings.
CLARENCE: Oh, I've got to earn them, and you'll help me, won't you?
CLARENCE: By letting me help you.
GEORGE: Only one way you can help me. You don't happen to have eight thousand bucks on you?
CLARENCE: Oh, no, no. We don't use money in Heaven.
GEORGE: Oh, that's right, I keep forgetting. Comes in pretty handy down here, bub.
CLARENCE: Oh, tut, tut, tut.
GEORGE: I found it out a little late. I'm worth more dead than alive.
CLARENCE: Now look, you mustn't talk like that. I won't get my wings with that attitude. You just don't know all that you've done. If it hadn't been for you . . .
