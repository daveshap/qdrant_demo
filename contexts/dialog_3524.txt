WALTER: Now that is ridiculous, Dude. No one is going to cut your dick off.
DUDE: Thanks Walter.
WALTER: Not if I have anything to say about it.
DUDE: Yeah, thanks Walter. That gives me a very secure feeling.
WALTER: Dude--
DUDE: That makes me feel all warm inside.

WALTER: Fucking Germans. Nothing changes. Fucking Nazis.
DONNY: They were Nazis, Dude?
WALTER: Come on, Donny, they were threatening castration!
DONNY: Uh-huh.
WALTER: Are you gonna split hairs?
DONNY: No--
WALTER: Am I wrong?
DONNY: Well--
DUDE: They're nihilists.
WALTER: Huh?
DUDE: They kept saying they believe in nothing.
WALTER: Nihilists! Jesus.
DUDE: Yeah.

DUDE: What're you, a fucking park ranger now?
WALTER: No, I'm--
DUDE: Who gives a shit about the fucking marmot!
WALTER: --We're sympathizing here, Dude--
DUDE: Fuck your sympathy! I don't need your sympathy, man, I need my fucking Johnson!
DONNY: What do you need that for, Dude?
WALTER: You gotta buck up, man, you can't go into the tournament with this negative attitude--
