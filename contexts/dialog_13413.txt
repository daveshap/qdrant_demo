RAND: As a matter of fact, it means the sugar syrup is ready to be poured off. You'll have to excuse me.
BETSY: Of course. It's been nice of you to spend this much time with me.
RAND: Don't worry. I wasn't missed. The only important man here is the owner.
BETSY: Mr. Holland?
RAND: Yes, the redoubtable Paul. He has the plantation, and I, as you must have noticed, have all the charm.
BETSY: I don't know. He spoke to me last night on the boat. I liked him very much.
RAND: Ah, yes, our Paul, strong and silent and very sad -- quite the Byronic character. Perhaps I ought to cultivate it.
BETSY: Perhaps you ought to get on to the mill.
RAND: It'll wait.
