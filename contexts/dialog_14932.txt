ELLIE: Good luck with the fund raising.
GRANT: It was never easy, but before Jurassic Park, you could find money. Somewhere. Now fossils are out. Everyone wants to see a real live dinosaur.
ELLIE: Times change Alan. But you're the still the best. I mean that.
GRANT: The last of my breed.
GRANT: I'd better get going.
ELLIE: Let me know if I can help, Alan. Youâ€™re bad about asking for help, but please ask me. Anything, anytime.
GRANT: Okay. Goodbye, Ellie.
ELLIE: Goodbye, Alan.
ELLIE: When I met you, I thought that one day millions of years ago, all the dinosaurs became extinct. Wiped out. But you told me otherwise. When conditions changed, dinosaurs changed. They became other things. They evolved.
GRANT: A well-accepted theory.
ELLIE: Alan don't be afraid to evolve.
