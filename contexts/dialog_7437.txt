JABEZ: Remember, Mary, how he said it: Couldn't have done better myself
MARY: Oh, Jabez -- it was a wonderful day --
MARY: But I'm glad to be home again --
JABEZ: Tired?
MARY: Worried!
JABEZ: There is nothing to worry about now.
MARY: You'll never change -- will you?
JABEZ: Mary -- you just wait and see -- It's all -- just the beginning -- just the beginning -- of everything. I'll be the biggest man in New Hampshire and you'll be the wife of the biggest man.
