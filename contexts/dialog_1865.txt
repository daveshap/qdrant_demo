BUD: There's a call for you --
FRAN: For me?
BUD: -- Mr. Sheldrake.
FRAN: I don't want to talk to him.
BUD: I think you should. I have to run down to the grocery anyway -- all that's left around here is one frozen pizza -- I'll be right back -- okay?
FRAN: Hello, Jeff. Yes, I'm all right.
SHELDRAKE: Fran, why did you do it? It's so childish -- and it never solves anything -- I ought to be very angry with you, scaring me like that -- but let's forget the whole thing -- pretend it never happened -- what do you say, Fran? Fran --
SHELDRAKE: Are you there, Fran?
FRAN: Of course I'm not here -- because the whole thing never happened -- I never took those pills -- I never loved you -- we never even met -- isn't that the way you want it?
SHELDRAKE: There you go again -- you know I didn't mean it that way, Fran. Just get well -- do what the nurse tells you -- I mean Baxter -- and I'll see you as soon as I can. Bye, Fran.
