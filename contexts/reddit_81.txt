How do I go from being in a relationship with someone to friends with benefits??
Im 16, female, in high school, and I have strong feelings towards this guy. We were dating but with school he says heâ€™s too busy for a relationship. We still have s*x and I still really like him so it just makes me feel sad.. is there a way to help me get over him? Or at least help me go from a relationship with him to just friends?
