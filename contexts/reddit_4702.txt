Currently victor over my depression. I’m grateful for the opportunity to be a support. Just message me.
I found my hope in recovery groups and I do positive things on a daily basis which over time has made my life gradually less and less of a crisis. 

I know what it’s like in the place where nothing matters and I’m lucky to have made it out for now. 

I’m grateful for my blessings and I would be grateful to be there for you. Just send me a word
