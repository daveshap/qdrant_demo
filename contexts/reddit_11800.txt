I'm sick of myself and I can't cope with life at the moment
Hey. I hate myself, but I'm mostly apathetic when it comes to work, my health and my life. I'm a lazyand cynical procrastinator who has a huge ego. It pisses me off that I can't finish anything, that I always give up and that I don't have any motivation. I tell myself everyday that I should try to improve, exercise, be productive and so forth, but me/my mind holds me back if I try to get started. I've tried to follow all the advices out there: "Get out of your comfort zone, be kind to yourself, work hard, follow your dreams, try to help others", but nothing seems to work.  I think I'm depressed or suffer from anxiety, but knowing that doesn't help me at all. I'm not suicidal, I just feel like a weak and useless parasite. Oh and yes, I'm planning on going to a therapist.
