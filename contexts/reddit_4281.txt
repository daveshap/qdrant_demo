i’m so extremely and utterly happy in my relationship.
my names Elizabeth, i’m 23. i have been in some really bad relationships and some really bad situations. but currently i’m with someone who makes me feel like all the pain and hurt i’ve gone through was so worth it because i have him. he’s so sweet and he doesn’t use my trauma against me and he loves me and guyyysssss. i’m just so so happy. sorry for the rant. i just, my heart is racing and i just need to vent about this guy. he’s just perfect.
