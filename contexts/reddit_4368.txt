Coping method that works for me
You know how sometimes you literally can't control your thoughts and it spirals out of control and all of a sudden you're thinking about how that one time when you messed up makes you want to crash you car into a tree in the hopes it'll kill you?

Well I've sort found a good way of coping with that. It is very simple. Just say out loud to yourself: "I don't want to be thinking about this right now. Let's think about something else."
At this point in my recovery I'm able to just think it in my head when I detect some toxic thoughts and move on. But starting out it was quite hard. I would say this sentence in different variations depending on where I was and what I was doing. 
When I was driving I would say "Hey, let's not think about this in a car." Or I would district myself with a "I wonder what's on the radio. What stations are good? I hope 105.3 the shark isn't just playing commercials right now. Or maybe I should listen to pop music."
If I was walking down town it would be "I should go to the library" Or "I wonder that store sign is still up even though it's been closed for years now." 
Basically say out loud to yourself anything that isn't what you are currently thinking that is neutral in emotion. You don't want to go straight from toxic depression to toxic positivity. Take a neutral stance on your state of mind and surroundings and comment on that. Overtime it can become a good habit that can stop panic attacks before they happen.
