BRUCE: I said -- uh -- I said even ten minutes -- is a long time -- to be away from you.
HILDY: Don't be embarrassed, Bruce. I heard it, but I just wanted to hear it again. I can stand being spoiled a little. The gentleman I'm going to have a chat with did very little spoiling.
BRUCE: I'd like to spoil him just once. Sure you don't want me to go in with you?
HILDY: My job, Bruce. I started it -- and I'll finish it.
BRUCE: I suppose you're right -- but if it gets rough, remember I'm here.
HILDY: I'll come a-running, pardner.
