Masters in molecular biology or environmental sustainability?
Hello guys, I am a biology bachelor graduate from a university in the US and I recently applied for a masters in molecular biology and also a masters in environmental sustainability in Germany.

I am very interested in working with environmental sustainability (at least I think so as I haven’t had direct experience working at it yet, but I am passionate about the subject) and love the molecular side of biology, to which I am somewhat more acquainted to as I took classes like microbiology, genetics, advanced cell, cancer and some others. 

Currently I am somewhat undecided into which path I want to follow, so I wanted to ask for some advice or knowledge you can share. If I went for the molecular biology masters, would it be possible for me to link it with environmental work? 
I love conceptual molecular biology but I feel like I would like more a job that doesn’t have me sitting in a lab for hours, maybe something that makes me go into the field or is more dynamic in nature. Do you guys think this is something achievable at some point? (Wether it’s hard or not)

Thanks!! Hope you throw some insight into this very confused guy
