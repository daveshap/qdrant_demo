STAN: I'll go out for a smoke. If no one minds.
MIERZWIAK: That's fine, Stan.
MARY: Do you like quotes, Howard?
MIERZWIAK: How do you mean?
MARY: Oh, um, like famous quotes. I find reading them inspirational to me. And in my reading I've come across some I thought you might like, too.
MIERZWIAK: Oh. Well, I'd love to hear some.
MARY: Okay, um, there's one that goes Blessed are the forgetful
MIERZWIAK: Is that Nietzsche?
MARY: Yeah, yeah it is, Howard. And here I was thinking I could tell you something you didn't know.
MIERZWIAK: It's a good quote, Mary. I'm glad we both know it.
MARY: There's another one I like, I read. It's by Pope Alexander.
MIERZWIAK: Alexander Pope?
MARY: Yes, shit. Oops, sorry! Sorry. It's just I told myself I wasn't going to say Pope Alexander and sound like a dope and then I go ahead and do it. Like I psyched myself out.
MIERZWIAK: It's no big deal.
MARY: You are such a sweetheart.
