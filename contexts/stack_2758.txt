Control of Nuclear Fission What is it precisely which prevents current technology in nuclear fission from controlling the size of fission products; in other words, why is it not feasible, presuming that such an approach would permit the translation of binding energies to heat in nuclear fission reactions, to create lighter more manageable fission products, thus rendering that fission technology relatively safe?  Further, if this constraint is due to the electrical neutrality of the neutron, what prevents the induction of a manageable charge or manipulation of the neutron magnetic dipole moment?
