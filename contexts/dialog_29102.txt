M: Thank you Colonel Everhart. 007, I'd like to see you in my office. Why don't you and the Colonel exchange numbers if you need more information?
BOND: Yes, M.
BOND: Interesting presentation.
DOMINIQUE: Interesting video tape.
BOND: They point, I shoot.
DOMINIQUE: Do you have a pen? I just got promoted and don't have my new cards yet.
BOND: Of course.
DOMINIQUE: ... Does this do anything?
BOND: Depends what number you write.
BOND: Married?
DOMINIQUE: Happily.
BOND: ... Kids?
DOMINIQUE: Three. You? Married?
BOND: No.
DOMINIQUE: I didn't think so.
DOMINIQUE: Here. I gave you my assistant's phone number. If it's urgent, she knows where to reach me.
BOND: Thanks. Take care -
DOMINIQUE: You too.
BOND: Moneypenny! We've got to stop meeting like this. They may be on to us.
MONEYPENNY: Hello, James. Enjoy your meeting?
BOND: In the darkest moments, it's what I live for. Especially since I've heard how much you like to watch... On the hidden camera.
MONEYPENNY: By the way, James: Ordinarily I would never ask, but... Weren't you and that Colonel once stranded on a raft for two weeks in the Sargasso Sea?
BOND: Moneypenny! How indiscreet! Have you ever known me to kiss and tell?
MONEYPENNY: Actually, I've never known you to do either... But -
BOND: - We all want what we can't have?
MONEYPENNY: Not all of us, 007.
BOND: What - no lust for adventure?
MONEYPENNY: No, 007. It's just that I've learned from personal experience - that when we get what we want - Somehow the reality is never as... Satisfying as the fantasy.
