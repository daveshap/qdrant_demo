How do I deal with my own low work morale?
I really hate my job I graduated in December and got a job immediately as an insurance agent at a call center. Although I am licensed, I hate it. Everything is about stats and no matter what apparently I can’t speak to customer the way they want and I’ve never been told I have bad CS skills.

I’m just tired and depressed I’ve been looking for other jobs but at this point it’s a struggle to go to work everyday
