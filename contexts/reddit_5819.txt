Thoughts on the viability of marketing vs finance vs computer science
I am a bit away from going to uni, but i hear lots of good things about computer science degrees and finance, as well as marketing. which degree is better? what is more versitile, has higher pay, and steady growth and job prospects? what is your thoughts on these degrees?

I am in my freshman year on high school, and my strengths are mainly math and science, but I have recovered my grades from a D to a B in computer science and am starting to really enjoy it, however math is not my strong suit. Ditto with finance, as I am interested in stocks and the financial markets, but am bad at math.



I am going into 10th grade next year and will be learning HTML, python, and maybe javascript as a course in school. how much of a leg up would a proficiencies in these languages give me in university?



is computer science over saturated right now
