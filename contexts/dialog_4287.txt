DULANEY: Would it be fair to say that when she did find out it was a shock to her?
ROSTON: Yes.
DULANEY: No further questions.
DULANEY: What's that for?
REBECCA: To celebrate how masterfully you destroyed Roston today.
DULANEY: Rebecca -- we shattered a man's life in open court.
REBECCA: Fuck him! He tried to shatter mine.
DULANEY: He was only doing what he thought was right.
REBECCA: You're too weak, Frank. When you want something you have to do what- ever it takes to get it. If something gets in your way you remove it.
DULANEY: You killed him -- didn't you?
REBECCA: I knew you were thinking that. I could see it in your eyes today in the courtroom. You're wrong, Frank. I need you to believe that.
DULANEY: You don't need anybody.
REBECCA: I do need you. No matter what you think of me -- I didn't do it.
DULANEY: I'm dropping the case.
REBECCA: No -- you're not.
