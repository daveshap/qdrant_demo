NICHOLAS: I need the police.
GIRL: Let's get you dried off first. I might have some clothes below.
NICHOLAS: You know, these fit... perfectly.
GIRL: They were my husband's. My late husband... may he rest in peace.
GIRL: I've been so lonely.
NICHOLAS: I can't tell you how <u>not</u> interested I am.
GIRL: Don't be nervous. They said you'd be nervous.
NICHOLAS: Don't take another step.
GIRL: Isn't this what you like? They told me you had a thing for boats.
NICHOLAS: First they try to kill me, now you? Put your damn clothes back on.
