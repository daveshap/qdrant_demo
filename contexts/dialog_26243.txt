MORINO: So you need three hundred dollars? Of course, I could give you three hundred dollars. Only I'm not going to.
GILLIS: No?
MORINO: Gillis, get this through your head. I'm not just your agent. It's not the ten per cent. I'm your friend.
GILLIS: How's that about your being my friend?
MORINO: Don't you know the finest things in the world have been written on an empty stomach? Once a talent like yours gets into that Mocambo- Romanoff rut, you're through.
GILLIS: Forget Romanoff's. It's the car I'm talking about. If I lose my car it's like having my legs out off.
MORINO: Greatest thing that could happen to you. Now you'll have to sit behind that typewriter. Now you'll have to write.
GILLIS: What do you think I've been doing? I need three hundred dollars.
MORINO: Maybe what you need is another agent.
