The only thing keeping me alive is the fear that I’ll survive
I’m afraid that I’ll survive and become physically deformed and mentally handicapped. This is one of the few things that will make my pointless life even worse. Even if I somehow do survive without any of this happening to me, I will be forced to be medicated and forced to go to therapy. Everyone would just see me as a person who attempted suicide and not a normal person for the rest of my life.
