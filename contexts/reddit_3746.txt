Here is what I learned in my 112 active days of online dating...and Ive stopped bc ironically I found someone in-person
What I learned or had reaffirmed from my dating blitz**^1** (31 different girls, 78 dates,!nearly 10 new “bed post notches,” over $2,500 spent on dates, app subscriptions, clothes, etc)

* whether you believe you’re out of their league or you’re not (overall, not just in the looks department), ***you are right***. 

Confidence really is everything. And insecurity really kills boners and lady boners. 

* It’s a lot more feasible to follow Rules 1 and 2 than you believe — but it takes work

Sure, genetics rule all. 

But if you work out, get a fitting haircut, take care of yourself overall (nice skin, healthy skin color, healthy looking eyes, not-yellow teeth) and you show some sort of effort in fashion, you’ll be ahead of the curve so much that you’ll be considered physically attractive. 

I am not conventionally good-looking. But I workout, take care of myself, dress well when needed, and I’m an awesome person. 

I’ve gotten feedback such as “you’re fucking addicting” and “you’re extremely attractive...official 12/10 rating” and “no, you’re cute” (after I passively texted “oh that’s cute” to a dog pic) etc. 

But fret not...

* It’s like the worst-kept secret that guys typically take terrible pics 

...and the ones that take great ones usually disappoint and/or are narcissist (just from the many anecdotes I heard). 

I got so many “wow you look so much better than your pics” and “why do guys always take such bad pics?”

Because we are guys. 

Of course, that brings up the quandary of whether you should knowingly put up a bad pic or try too hard by putting up a try-hard pic. Obviously, the answer is neither — though even our best pics still don’t do us justice. 

But isn’t that better than being photogenic? Even for a dating app? Better that than disappointing someone IRL. 

* your first online messaging convo should be 10 minutes MAX

Just some flirting, some clear signals of attraction and suggestive comments for activities, then mention that you’re jumping off the app to do something else and — this is up to you — either give them your number or ask for theirs.

I’ve had great success just saying “k gotta go but we should totally [get pancakes for dinner] so text me at 9118675309” and like 80% of the time I get a text within 3 minutes, 95% of the time I get a text. 

* girls are way too good at taking pics. Beware. 

No body pics nearly always means they’re hiding it. You may be into it. You may not be. I’m just pointing it out. 

Even the hot girls don’t look as hot in person. 

Why?

Girls have literally 1000s of pictures of themselves, on average. Imagine their top 0.5%. They are not going to look their 99.5% best the first time nor every time. 

But that’s obviously ok. 

* There is such a thing as having too many dates and it’s a shitty thing to do

It just is. It’s narcissism. I had that streak. And I got my penance for it. I did shit like slept over at a tinder girl’s date then showed up at an 11am brunch date with a girl I actually liked 20 min late because the previous girl’s shower felt like Chinese water torture, and I showed up in the only clean shirt I had — that girl’s souvenir Toronto tourism T-shirt that smelled like a girl. 

But the worst was having to try to be mature and break it off with girls I had been on 3-4+ dates with.  

It broke me. It humbled me. I don’t ever want to feel that way again. No it’s not a good problem to have. What the fuck will you do with all the dates? Naturally you’ll be seeing like 4-5 people for the 3rd or 4th time — it just doesn’t work. 

* Do not talk dating with dates

Obvious. But not so much. I did this early and got punished and stopped. 

Many others still did this. 

* Hope for guys: the quality of the dating pool for girls may be deep in numbers but shallow in quality

So don’t worry about how there are so many guys. You cannot control that anyway.

Change what you have control over — yourself. 

* Personality goes a long fucking way

We all know this. Imagine being with a hot girl or guy who is vapid and stupid. Now imagine being with a moderately cute girl or guy who makes you laugh and makes your heart sink when her name pops up in your phone. 

* Improve yourself for you. Sincerely. Then, dating benefits will come 

I’m done convincing people of this. Either you get it or you don’t. But I’m comfortable calling this a truth. It works. Trust the process. But you should be doing it for yourself — you owe it to yourself. 

Here’s what scared me straight: imagining meeting a multiverse version of me who was the best version of me and picturing what he’d be like and how terrible he’d make me feel. I tried to become that guy. 

* Asian guys: stop making excuses

It’s not because you’re Asian. It’s because you’re letting it get to your head. 

I dated like 50/25/25 white/asian/other. All the girls were attractive physically. I even had a pseudo relationship with a hot black girl (until she tried to propose to me, yikes). 

Rid your insecurity and do away with excuses. And hitting the gym may help. 

But yeah, there are girls not into asian guys. But then again, this summer I heard at least from a dozen different girls “I never thought I’d _____ with an Asian guy.” 

Oh also, asian guys who are violently and/or emotionally abusive, go fuck yourselves. The stereotype is strong according to too many anecdotes. 

* Tinder has gotten worse very quickly, but Tinder Vegas is awesome

If you’re looking to just hook up in Vegas, fire up that Tinder and spring for Gold. 

I feel like Tinder in Vegas brings the app back to its roots: a user base comprising mostly young and hot people looking for no strings hooking up. 

Just put in your bio you’re in Vegas for XYZ period. It will work. And like 9/10 profiles are HOT. 

As mentioned I was 35 now 36, and hooked up with two smoking hot girls (age 26 was fine but age 23 made me feel a bit creepy...until we were hooking up...what?) back to back nights and we haven’t talked since.

* If you’re looking for relationships, CMB and Hinge worked well for me

Bumble must run on college interns because Bumble was fine early May then just got worse and worse over the summer. 

I get high quality matches and likes on Hinge for free. 

I get high volume and occasional high quality matches on CMB. 

Tinder is hit or miss. 

* Value NOT “shared interests” but ***shared principles***

No one gives a shit if you guys both like At The Drive-In or Godspeed You Black Emperor.  Congrats, you both listen to the ultimate hipster music before hipsters were a thing. Who cares?

I already have people in my life who share interests with me, people with whom I get along well — they’re called friends. 

You want to share relationship and life-outlook principles with your significant other. Quoting your favorite GB Shaw quote during a fight won’t do shit. 

If anything, having different interests makes it more fun. Lots of new things to try. And you know it’s real when you find yourself staring at her as she discusses her hobby passionately and you just keep thinking of how to participate with her or get her something thoughtfully related as a gift. 

* actions speak louder than words

What they say matters little. What they do matters a lot. 

We should know this by now. 

This is how I knew the one I’m with now is the one I want to be with for the long haul: she was the 31st different girl I had met, and I had a second date after a great first one — and for the first and only time, I showed up to a date 15 minutes early instead of 1-2 min early or late. I did it because I really liked her. She noticed (since I was picking her up) and she later told me she saw it as a good sign from me. 

* it’s not them it’s you

More times than not, this is the answer to “why can’t I find anyone?”

* it’s much better to show physical affection early than to play it safe

This is how you get ghosted even by people who liked you. 

No surprise, many girls (and everyone else) like to feel wanted. 

Don’t play games, don’t play it safe, don’t be gross. You’re on a date. You already find each other attractive. 

**SHE COULD BE DOING SOMETHING ELSE THAT MOMENT WITH SOMEONE ELSE OR NOTHING AT ALL...BUT SHE IS THERE WITH YOU ON PURPOSE**

Yes it’s from Hitch. Doesn’t mean he’s not right. 

The date is yours to fuck up. Everything is in place. 

Little things like putting your hand on her back or shoulder blade for two seconds, or grabbing her hand to help her out of the car, or a playful slap of her arm. They work. 

Also, pick up on cues. If she’s on your left and totally moving her hair to the other side while talking to you, she is giving you signs. Too many signs to list. Research them. Act on them. 

You may get rejected, sure. 

Better than being ghosted and “not knowing” where it went wrong. 

* Don’t lie 

Duh. It’s a lose lose. If you get serious with her, she will find out. It’s also social and sexual fraud. 

* The One doesn’t exist. But Your One does. And that person may be online, or you might meet that person in real life. 

I didn’t learn this so much as it just reaffirmed something that didn’t need reaffirming. 

Stop looking for him or her. Fate nor destiny doesn’t exist. There is no grand plan. There is no cupid. Etc. 

This is all comforting. It means that it’s in our own hands. (Sure, “luck” is involved, but not so much luck as it is just fortuitous timing and placement in a completely chaotic world where we have virtually no control over what happens, and even then, we have no knowledge of what could have been or what could be). 

But the bottom line is that you don’t have to worry about there being only one or “the only one” out there — the only thing you should and can worry about is what you can control: yourself (your self-identity, your appearance and grooming and hygiene and style and look, your fitness shape, parts of your personality that are more pliable and definitely the negative traits, etc). 

For me to have met my current (and likely last) SO, sooooo many things outside of my control had to have happened. Even if, for example, I happened to show up to my yoga class 5 minutes later that day then she and I 100% wouldn’t have ever met since she went to my class for the first and only time, and I met her ***in real life*** (poetic how I spend all this time and effort and money on online dating only to find My One**^2** through in-person interaction).  

What I could control was my fitness, appearance, my sense of humor, and the ability to muster up enough “courage” to ask her out after a yoga class (probably what some/many girls would just hate happening in their yoga classes, especially if more men came just to make it “a place for guys to meet and ask out girls” but I legitimately do yoga twice a week to balance out my exercises). 

**And she said yes**. (And I don’t think that’ll be the last time I’ll say those 4 words about her and me asking her an important yes/no question; though technically she “rejected me” when I asked if she wanted to grab some coffee afterwards only to find me on FB that night — we had talked a little bit outside before class began — and apologize and explain that she was a bit taken aback and flattered and blushing when I asked her out, and that she mainly said “no” because she “felt gross and sweaty” after hot yoga, but that she wanted to grab dinner instead...and the rest is hopefully history forever in the making)

As I said, SO many things had to happen for us to even date. None of that I could control. But I could’ve been a disheveled slob and likely not gotten a date with her even if the stars aligned...but I can control whether or not I look presentable. 

* Bottom line: it’s chaotic out there, online and in the real world. Take solace in the fact that you can only worry about what you can control, and relative to the chaos, there’s very little to control 

Again, just physically, you can turn yourself from a 5/10 or 6/10 — depending on just how “off” you are with grooming yourself or how bad your haircut is etc — into even an 8.5/10 or something. 

**Step 1**: get a proper and possibly new hair style/cut. GO TO AN EXPENSIVE STYLIST JUST ONCE TO GET A RECOMMENDATION. Even a place that costs $35 for a haircut. They’ll tell you what best fits you. 

A haircut can make you look like a bum while another can make you look handsome AF. Compare World War Z Brad Pitt to Oceans 13 Brad Pitt, Limitless Bradley Cooper to Limitless Bradley Cooper after he has “cleaned up,” or *NSYNC Justin Timberlake to Justin Timberlake, or John Krasinski in the early seasons of The Office to his final season...and he keeps getting better looking now that he’s RIPPED....

**Step 2^^: hit the gym and watch what you eat. You don’t have to go full John Krasinski but there’s like a 95% chance that you can improve your physical health/looks, whether it’s trimming some fat, gaining some muscle, ridding yourself of the cancer patient look, dripping down from obesity, etc. 

Biologically, women are *generally* attracted to “healthy looks,” like good skin color, healthy shape, healthy hair/skin, ample muscle tone, etc. Many of these things help with producing better offspring and protecting the offspring. 

**Step 3**: Overhaul your wardrobe if it “sucks.” Hell, you can spend a few hundred dollars at H&M and have enough “stylish” clothes for years as a guy. 

There’s no single style. Pick one that suits both your personality and body type. Maybe you like skinny jeans but you’re overweight — don’t do it. Maybe you like the grunge look but weigh 130lbs at 5’8”. Well you can’t even wear loose flannel without looking like a girl who slept over at a guy’s house. 

Pick out stylish clothes that accentuate your best features. I have a strong jaw line and high cheek bones, so I keep my hair rather short and choose shirts and jackets that have collars that accentuate my jawline. I have nice arms and shoulders apparently (I had better have them, I worked out for them), and I often get complimented about them because I wear NOT *tight* shirts but shirts just loosely above “fitted” where it’s almost like I’m hiding them. 

**Step 4**: General grooming 

Accentuate your features, but also choose a style that matches your personality and life stage. Don’t be wearing lettermen jackets if you’re 38, unless you look young or are black (in which case they look young too). 

Grow a beard if your jawline is “missing.” Shave if you have a jawline and/or can’t grow a glorious beard. 

Cut your hair short or shave it if you’re balding. Grow it long if you have a small head and round face. Cut your hair if you have a square face and/or jawline, as long hair looks AWFUL on square jaws. 

Have the right facial hair. If you can’t grow it fully just go clean. 

Shower shower shower. Not just on date nights. Bacteria accumulate. You don’t want to have trouble getting rid of BO because you haven’t showered in 4 days. 

Wear clean clothes. 

Footwear is important. Don’t wear the same 2-3 pairs of shoes unless all 3 are very different, fashionable, clean, and they can match your clothes. And this applies only to first and second dates. Don’t wear your Jordan’s for a second time on your 4th date...at a steakhouse. That shit may have flown on your second date playing mini-golf and going casual because it’s summer and outdoors but good god man have some shoes that you can wear at a place that has cloth that doesn’t have unlimited breadsticks. And no, work shoes don’t count. 

FIND YOUR *OWN* SCENT. Believe it or not, that Light Blue cologne from Dolce & Gabana that you believe smells great? Yeah, only like 10,000 other guys in your area think so, too....and thus, it’s popular. You don’t want to end up smelling like everyone else. 

You can still wear popular colognes but I suggest ***trying Axe body spray*** to BLEND, not MIX or COMBINE, the scents. 

Yes.  Body spray. For 2 reasons (if you need another, I’ve had at least 5 girls tell me I smell great unprompted on dates, and another 4-5 friends say the same)

1) Reddit will tell you that Axe is for 13-year olds. Largely, they’re correct. But you’re not using it as your catch-all tool to smell like you’ve showered. You’re using it as a non-cologne fragrance undertone to blend with your cologne and make something totally ***unique as a fragrance that girls can only associate with you***. Of course, this matters more with girls you go on 3rd+ dates with or are in a relationship with. The body spray goes UNDER your outfit while the cologne outside if, with some cologne underneath. Small dabs though. 

2) you want to smell good naked, not just like deodorant but body spray and a hint of cologne, whereas with clothes on you want to smell like cologne with hints of body spray. 

Just do NOT smell like the last guy she just had dinner with. You WILL encounter that if you just wear cologne from Macy’s (nothing at all against Macy’s; they have all colognes that even the stores themselves don’t carry in stock, but it also means many men go there and buy the same ones you’re wearing). 

* **FINALLY: yes, self-improvement is the key. But do not do it for anyone but yourself. Do it for dating and you will never attain the level of improvement you need. It’s a catch 22. Thankfully.**

**TLDR: either you read it or didn’t. It’s your dating life. These are words from someone who dated nearly 3 dozen girls in a short time and learned a great deal.**


———————————————————–

**^1**

I’m fortunate to have been able to date at all. Yes I was the best version of myself. But...

First off, I’m an Asian guy — strike 1 for online dating, I’m 36 — strike 2, and my pictures are all years old because I don’t take selfies and I’ve had to I untagged myself from many Facebook pics during a job search a half decade ago — strike 3. Many will tell you that being an Asian guy alone = zero dates, and many will tell you being over 30 and especially 35 will hinder you, nope...still got dates. Oh, and I used pics from like 2011...which many girls called misleading because....well, I’ve gotten countless comments on me being “far more attractive” in person (someone even rated me as a 12/10). 

**^2**

Yeah it’s early but while age is just a number, it can also be an indicator of dating and relationship experience. We are both around our mid-30s, but no kids or divorces....just bad “luck,” and we both have and had zero desperation in finding a partner because we were both on the verge of taking a break from dating...

...but we managed to bump into each other and we are already in ***marriage***-talk mode, which, if we weren’t in our 30s with extensive dating and LTR experience each and we were 24 instead, we’d probably be focused more on ***wedding***-talk, as the former focuses more on how we’d operate as partners and things we notice that makes us great partners and the latter focuses on just being swept up in love — or infatuation — and *getting married* instead of *staying married*....it’s just two young kids not wanting a good thing to stop, without thinking about how the good thing can last and how much work it takes. My Also, since my SO and I have had many LTRs, this is one of the cases where we have bot the “just know” feeling but we’ve also logically thought it out)
