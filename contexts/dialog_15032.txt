LUDLOW: What kind of gun is that?
ROLAND: My father's .600 Nitro Express. Made in 1904. Karimojo Bell gave it to him after he took down his last elephant. 8700 foot pound striking force.
LUDLOW: How close do you have to be?
ROLAND: Forty yards. Less, maybe. I assume it'll take a slug in the brain case to bring him down.
LUDLOW: Why not just use a scope and a poison dart and snipe him from a hill?
