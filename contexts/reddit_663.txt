Unproportional Nose
Before entering teenage years Iâ€™ve always had a normal, cute looking nose but then during the past years of being a teenager my nose started started sticking out, looking way too big. Will it go back to looking normal with age? Do noses usually look more proportional with face after teenage years phase? should I get a nose job?
