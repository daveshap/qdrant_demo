CLAUDIA: Oh God! I love you still, that's the torment of it. But you know I must leave you Louis...
LOUIS: Yes...
CLAUDIA: And who will care for me my love, my dark angel, when you are gone?
LOUIS: You promise to care for her then?
MADELEINE: Yes...
LOUIS: And you know what you ask for?
MADELEINE: Yes.
LOUIS: What do you think she is, Madeleine? A doll?
MADELEINE: A child who can't die...
LOUIS: And the child who did die?
MADELEINE: My daughter...
LOUIS: Look at the gaslight. Don't tke your eyes off it. You will be drained to the point of death, but you must stay alive. Do you hear me?
MADELEINE: Yes!
