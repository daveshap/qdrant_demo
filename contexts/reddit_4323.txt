Tonight I showered and got all of the knots out of my hair
I struggle with depression. Just like a lot of you. I go long periods of time without showering. I like to stay in bed until I have to go to work then go to bed right when I get home. Repeat.  It happens. I have long curly hair and wear it up in a bun on top of my head. And I sleep with it like that. And it gets so knotted up I can’t get them out. So whenever I shower, (every 3 weeks usually...it’s awful, I know. This time it’s been since Christmas. ) I brush out as much as I can but leave the rest because I get tired. Well tonight, I brushed as much out as I could before getting in, and got the hard ones while I was washing it. It’s doesn’t really seem like an accomplishment, but I’m pretty damn proud of myself. They can get so bad to the point I would just want to shave my head. To make it easier. But tonight, I won the battle. 

Whatever battle you may be fighting, keep fighting. Things will eventually turn up the way you want. It may take time, but be patient with it. You will be okay. 

I washed my hair tonight.
