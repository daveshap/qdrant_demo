SELENA: Nigel, get lost.
NIGEL: I have to talk to you.
SELENA: You're wasting your breath.
NIGEL: You used to listen to me. When you asked me to teach you something of the Craft.
SELENA: I could teach you a thing or two now.
NIGEL: ...trust the wisdom of the ancients, trust the Great Mother to protect us... Why. are you staring at me like that?
SELENA: I was just thinking, if I had your skin problems, I'd use a good tannisroot ointment. Every night.
NIGEL: Nothing's wrong with my skin.
SELENA: Such a shame. You ought to take better care of yourself.
