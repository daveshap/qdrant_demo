Should I take a low-paying warehouse job or wait for unemployment?
Like many, I was recently furloughed from my position as a Logistics Coordinator for a tap room/brewery due to the virus.  I just applied for an online delivery service to work at several positions, some office and some warehouse.  I already received a call about an interview for the warehouse position, even though my experience and my desire is to wait and see about the office positions.  The warehouse position is a huge pay cut from my previous job and would require me to work all hours of the day (not sure how many hours total).  I applied for unemployment in my state 2 weeks ago and still haven't gotten the requisite info.  I can't get through because their phone lines are famously jammed, their online chat is similarly jammed, and their email requires 7 days to get back to people.  Ideally, I would just sit on unemployment for a bit until I got desperate enough to take a job like this, but with the current situation, I really don't know when my next paycheck is.  What should I do?  Should I take the risk in ruining my unemployment that may never come?  Or should I just be patient and ride this out for a little bit longer?
