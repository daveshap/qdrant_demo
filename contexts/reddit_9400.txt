Ever notice people get treated better when they are rich?
You might think I'm joking, but some types of businesses can literally smell the poor on you.

Walk into a dealership dressed in nice clothes and tell them you wish to buy a brand new $60,000 luxury car.

Now have your brother, cousin, etc walk into the same place dressed in Walmart clothes and tell them you want the $2,000 beater in the corner of the lot.

I can bet you 100% you will be treated like garbage.

It really pisses me off too, because I have worked in retail and service most of my life and treat people with the same level of respect regardless of how rich or poor they appear to be.

But I've noticed anytime I've bought a car, even at reputable large dealerships, I am talked to with much less formality and rushed out of there and have witnessed rich old boomers buying brand new Cadillac's treated like the Queen of England.
