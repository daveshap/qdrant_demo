Help recall the exact idiom \"I'm against my brother, I'm with my brother against my cousin, I'm with my brother and cousing against everyone else\" There's a very interesting asian saying, describing dichotomy of a person's attitude towards others.My quote is probably incorrect, but it says roughy: <blockquote>  \"I'm against my brother, I'm with my brother against my cousin, I'm  with my brother and cousin against everyone else\"</blockquote>Can you help me recall, how this saying sounds exactly and what nation it belongs to?
