LISA: So, you feeling anything?
JESSE: What do you mean?
LISA: I thought you might be able to make a connection.
JESSE: Any ghosts in here?
LISA: C'mon, cut it out.
JESSE: Well, what am I supposed to do?
LISA: I don't know. Concentrate or some- thing.
JESSE: I feel like a jerk.
LISA: Shhh. Just concentrate.
LISA: Anything?
JESSE: Uh-uh. Wait...
JESSE: Disappointed?
LISA: About what?
JESSE: About not finding any bogey men?
LISA: I'll get over it.
