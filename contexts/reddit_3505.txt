Unpopular opinion: Everyone has MORE THAN ONE soulmate
Some people believe there’s a soulmate out there for everyone... The idea is that it’s a person who shares an off-the-charts type of connection with you right away. From the start, the two of you get on well with each other and feel a comfort level with each other that’s almost like you’ve known each other for years already.

But, other people believe that’s nothing more than a fairytale!

Yet, a third category of people is what this post is all about:

Do you believe there’s such a thing as a soulmate, but NOT just one of them out there for each of us?

I’ve run across a soulmate at least three different times in my life. How about you?
