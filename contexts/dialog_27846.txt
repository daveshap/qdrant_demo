HAGEN: What about Luca? Sollozzo didn't seem worried about Luca. That worries me.
SONNY: If Luca sold out we're in real trouble.
HAGEN: Has anyone been able to get in touch with him?
SONNY: No, and I've been calling all night. Maybe he's shacked up.
HAGEN: Luca never sleeps over with a broad. He always goes home when he's through. Mike, keep ringing Luca's number.
