PLANK: There's one steel gate as you go in but they never lock it.
DOG: What do you mean, never? Well what have they got it for, then?
PLANK: I must have been there fifty times, it's never been locked; they're not suspicious. Everybody who goes there are toffs. They're all into that karma crap: `If I don't harm nobody, nobody harms me' stuff.
DOG: Is there no way they can get back to you?
PLANK: Even if they could they'd be too shit scared. They have got no muscle; they're gutless faggots.
