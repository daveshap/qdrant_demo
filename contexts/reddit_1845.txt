Let's all take a moment to mourn the 17 and counting fellow high schoolers who were shot and killed in cold blood yesterday.
This shit is actually fucked up. These kids were just like us, dealing with high school stress, applying to college, and trying to trudge through teenage life. Just like every one of us, they were waiting for that 3:30 bell to ring so they could finally leave that boring english class or rush home to study for the next day's physics quiz. Instead, they were met with gunshots, sirens, and blood. A moment of silence and/or prayers please.
