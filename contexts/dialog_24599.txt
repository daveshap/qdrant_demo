MIKE: Think I should put the skateboard in bed with him?
ELLIE: Too kinky.
MIKE: Ellie, you know I think it's about time we got outa this place, get us a house of our own. We can afford it now.
ELLIE: Amen to that. The supermarket's full of assholes.
MIKE: Take my advice, don't buy any...
ELLIE: Mike?
MIKE: What?
ELLIE: My ass if falling.
MIKE: Your what...?
ELLIE: My ass is falling. It is.
MIKE: What are you talking about?
ELLIE: I just saw it in the mirror, it doesn't look like my ass anymore.
MIKE: Get in bed.
ELLIE: What am I gonna do? I jog, I do the exercises on TV in the morning... gravity...
MIKE: You got a great ass! I love your ass -- now get that falling ass into bed before it hits the floor.
ELLIE: Tomorrow, I start looking for our house... You love me?
MIKE: You got no idea...
ELLIE: Imagine... I'm sleepin' with a DT.
