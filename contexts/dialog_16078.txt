PIKE: Yeah, it's getting late. I could sure use a bath.
RAY: That's a real nice watch you got there, sir. Fancy old thing even plays a little tune.
PIKE: Yeah, it's special. They don't make 'em like this anymore.
RAY: Sure don't. Mind if I ask where you got it?
PIKE: Why, my wife gave it to me on our anniversary some years back.
RAY: Must have been some time ago. Maybe forty years?
PIKE: Something like that, yes.
RAY: She give you that scar, too?
PIKE: I oughta shoot you for that comment, boy.
RAY: Like you shot Winston Hancock?
WILKINS: What's going on here?
PIKE: I'm afraid I'm gonna have to teach this uppity nigger a lesson in manners.
