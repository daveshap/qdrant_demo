Its a saturday night, I'm at home and bored. I'm gonna go out alone and see if I have fun, wish me luck!

Thanks everyone for the support, I had a fun night and didn't have any anxiety at all, it was uncharted territory for me because I moved to this city about 3 weeks ago and I don't know anyone who lives close to me. Seeing all the replies telling me to have fun definitely made it much more fun too because, I accept that I'm a bit of a attention whore. Thanks again everyone, I love this subreddit.
