BARTON: Hear you had a little trouble, Quintero. Defective fuse? Well, you're all in one piece. So what's the beef?
RAMÓN: You know the beef. This new rule of yours, that we work alone. We're taking it up with the Super.
BARTON: Super's busy -- with your Negotiatin' Committee.
RAMÓN: So much the better.
BARTON: Now wait a minute. Super's the one made the rule. He ain't gonna give you no helper.
RAMÓN: He will if he wants us to go on blasting.
