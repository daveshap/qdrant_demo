CORA: They're going to hang you. Why didn't you leave when you had the chance?
HAWKEYE: Because what I am interested in is right here...
CORA: What would you have me do?
HAWKEYE: Webb's reinforcements will arrive or not. If they do not arrive, the fort will fall. If that happens, stay close to your father. The French will protect the officer class among the English.
CORA: No. I will find you.
HAWKEYE: Do not. Promise me.
