Compiler Parameters to isolate a C++ program Is there any set of compiler parameters that can be used to prevent a C++ program from having any access to most system functions, leaving it with access to read/write to stdin/stdout, but otherwise unable to harm the system.This strikes me as being useful for systems such as a homework submission server or an online \"tryit\" server.
