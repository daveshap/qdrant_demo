Today I won.
Today I got up, showered and actually washed /brushed my hair. I noticed that it was a beautiful day after literal WEEKS of rain so I took a bunch of blankets and pillows out on the deck with books and snacks .. I ate real food for the first time in 10 days (penne Bolognese ).. 

Last night I finally slept after days of being awake even if it was only for a few hours then again today I had a small nap. 

I ran my life today and it felt great. I hope this feeling stays... although I could use some more sleep which I hope comes easily tonight.
