MURPHY: Murphy to Epps.
EPPS: Epps.
MURPHY: You just shoot at something?
EPPS: Yeah. Just a bird. Just a stupid bird.
GREER: Ho-ly shit.
MURPHY: Couldn't have happened much more than a month ago.
MURPHY: Bodies're too fresh.
DODGE: Fresh ain't the first word that comes to mind.
MURPHY: Greek citizen. Merchant navy. Obviously we aren't the first to come across this ship. They probably stumbled across it just like we did.
GREER: And look what happened.
DODGE: Damn barbaric is what it is.
MURPHY: Could be meant as a warning.
GREER: Stay away. Or else.
EPPS: Because of the gold.
MURPHY: That'd be my guess.
DODGE: So whoever did this might still be around.
GREER: Maybe Epps's mystery man had something to do with it.
MURPHY: Maybe.
