PAUL: Well, is it now? How you getting along?
DENVER: Don't pay to complain.
PAUL: You on your way home?
DENVER: No. Got me an afternoon job at the shirt factory. Figure between that and my night work at the Bodwins I might be able to put something away for me and mama.
PAUL: They treating you right over at the Bodwins?
DENVER: More than all right. Miss Bodwin, she teach me stuff..Book stuff. She says I might go to Oberlin. She's experimenting on me.
PAUL: Your mother all right?
DENVER: No. Not a bit all right. Hasn't gotten out of bed since that day.
PAUL: You think I should stop by? Think she'd welcome it?
DENVER: I don't know. I think I've lost my mother, Paul D.
PAUL: That girl...You know, Beloved...
DENVER: Yes?
PAUL: She gone like they say?
DENVER: Haven't seen her since that day. Ella thinks she might be waiting in the woods for another chance but..I don't think so. Mama thinks she's gone for good. Says she can feel it.
PAUL: You think she sure 'nough your sister?
DENVER: At times. At other times I think she was...more. But who would know that better than you. I mean, you sure 'nough you her.
PAUL: Well, if you want my opinion...
DENVER: I don't. I have my own.
PAUL: You grown.
DENVER: Yes sir
PAUL: Well, good luck with the job.
DENVER: Thank you.
DENVER: And Paul D...you don't have to stay 'way, but be careful how you talk to my mama, hear?
PAUL: I will.
