Finally, A Good Date!
Met up for drinks at a local pub tonight, and spent about 3 hours talking, joking around, and getting to know each other. Instant energy/chemistry through the nervousness on my side of things (first date I've been on in a few months), and he even cuddled me when I got cold from the AC and we had a quick kiss goodbye with plans to meet up again as we parted ways. Texted each other again as soon as we both got to our homes to make sure we got back safe too.

I know it doesn't sound like much, but this was the best date I've had since my divorce from my long-time partner over a year ago, and it feels great to have a glimmer of hope for romance and possibly even love again after so long.

UPDATE:

Same guy and I have been texting a bunch every day since our first date, and today we had our second date, and I'm happy to report this one was just as awesome as the first! 

It was an impromptu coffee date this time after we both got off work. Then we had a quick grocery shopping trip together, which was way more fun than it sounds, we were goofing around, holding hands, and generally just being silly and cuddly the whole time, plus I got my shopping for the week done before picking up my son too (I'm a single Mom with full physical custody, so grabbing opportunities for a love life/dating whenever I can in between parenting responsibilities and my career is a necessary talent lol). We're seeing each other again next weekend for a lunch date, and there's definitely ongoing sparks and chemistry with no red flags so far, so this might actually be going somewhere. Over the moon here, guys, no matter what :D
