I only got one gift for Christmas but it was the best gift I could possibly have received!
I got a job! I’ve been unemployed for about a month and half and have been living off of my savings until I finally got a call back and finished my training! Happy new Year!

Edit: Thanks for all the comments! Didn’t realize this post would get attention lol and also thanks for the award!
