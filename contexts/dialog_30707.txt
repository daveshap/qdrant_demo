HEATHER: I thought you'd killed Freddy off.
BOB: We did. Bad mistake. The fans are clamoring for more. So, Evil never dies, right? Anyway, a while back we got a call from Wes. He's got this idea. And who better to resurrect Freddy than his creator?
HEATHER: I thought he'd stopped doing horror.
BOB: Believe it or not, he told me I hadn't heard from him in ten years because he hasn't had any good nightmare. They're his inspiration. But now he's got a new script in the works.
HEATHER: Which means he's having nightmares again?
BOB: He's very excited about it.
HEATHER: The nightmares.
BOB: He's excited about the script. You should be too. It stars you.
HEATHER: Can I read it?

HEATHER: You mean that was a...
BOB: Sort of a trial balloon.
HEATHER: I don't know, Bob. I'm flattered and all, but I've got a kid, now.

HEATHER: So I don't know about horror.
BOB: Come on. Kids love horror.
HEATHER: And I...I've got other things happening.
BOB: I'm sure we can match any offer.
