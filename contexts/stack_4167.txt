Are biometrics needed to renew Schengen tourist visa from UK for Indian? I am in the UK on a Tier 2 visa. I applied for a Schengen visa last year, which is expiring in March 2019, via the German embassy. I am now considering to apply for a new one via the French embassy.Do I have to go for biometrics to be taken in order to get another Schengen visa or can I do it by mail?
