6GB of \"System Storage\" on iPhone 6 - Reset Doesn't Clear It I have had issues with my iPhone's System Storage category taking up anywhere from 6 to 9 GB of storage.  This is a huge problem for me, as I have a 16GB phone!I have backed up and wiped my phone in every possible combination multiple times over the last year or so and nothing helps.  Plugging it into iTunes and letting it sit open for a few minutes will clear less than 500 MB, and eventually that gets racked back up again.Any ideas on how to fix this, or is my phone just screwed?
