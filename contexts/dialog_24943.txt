NORMAN: Don't be so optomistic, Harry.
HARRY: I'm completely serious. There is something very important missing from that spacecraft. You know what that is?
NORMAN: Not a clue.
HARRY: A sign that the builders knew time travel through a black hole was possible.
NORMAN: I don't follow you.
HARRY: On that flight recorder, they called the black hole an Unknown Entry Event." They didn't know what a black hole was. Fifty years from now
NORMAN: So what?
HARRY: So, <u>we know</u>. We know it went through a black hole. We saw it. Norman -- when we'd get to the surface, we'd tell someone about the black hole, wouldn't we? It'd go in some report like some big discovery. So in fifty years when they build that ship, they'd make precautions for a black hole. <u>But they didn't</u>. The called it an Unknown Entry Event.
NORMAN: Meaning we're never gonna get the chance to tell anyone.
HARRY: Meaning we're never gonna get to the surface alive... to tell anyone.
NORMAN: I can't believe that, Harry.
HARRY: Gimme another explanation.
NORMAN: I can't. If I had a minute to think, maybe, but I know you're wrong.
HARRY: Am I?
NORMAN: Look -- we're under a lot of pressure, we're tired, you're not thinking straight.
HARRY: You mean, you think I'm cracking?
NORMAN: No. I didn't say that.
HARRY: Then what, Norman?
NORMAN: It's what's in that sphere, isn't it, Harry? Whatever you think is in that thing -- you think it's going to kill you.
HARRY: Curious, isn't it? What's inside? Before I die, I'd sure like to open it and see.
BARNES: What caused it?
EDMUNDS: Nothing. I don't know. Everything was normal. No changes at all.
