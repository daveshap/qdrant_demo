Want to get into New Student and Family Programs and Orientations.. where do I begin?
I really want to acquire my masters in Higher Education. I'm currently going into my senior year at the University of Florida and have had a pretty involvement-heavy run (Greek life, tour office, SG, community service within the university, etc), which has made me realize that my passions lie with first generation students and wanting to work with incoming freshmen. I'm acquiring a B.S in Psychology and B.S in Family, Youth, and Community Sciences, minoring in Educational Studies. If I know this is my end goal, which graduate schools should I look into that would help suit those needs? Is the job market for this position very competitive as well?
