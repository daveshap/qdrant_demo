Installing two identical breakers in Parallel for very basic redundancy I have a question about an issue that has been discussed in this forum, but with slightly different parameters.  I completely understand that installing two smaller breakers in parallel instead of one large one is a NO GO, but in my setup things are very different.  I have a maximum load of 66 Amp @ 240 Volt split phase (Which happens very rarely, normally it runs at 30-35 Amps).  My client is asking me to feed this equipment from two separate breakers for redundancy (A little paranoid), so to try pleasing him I'm thinking about paralleling two breakers to feed the equipment.  Of course, EACH breaker I'm planing on installing in parallel is a 2x80 Amp Breaker running AWG # 2 cables for each breaker (95 Amps @ 60\u00b0C ) so I do not have the issue if one breaker trips the other one takes all the load and is not designed for it, nor does the cable.My question is, is it correct to do this?  I have no other way to \"Redundantly\" feed the equipment.  And I'm guessing that if for any reason one breaker trips or is turned off intentionally, the other will still feed the load and is designed to carry all the current.Of course I understand that I have to be careful that I \"parallel\" the phases correctly to avoid a short (L1 with L1 and L2 with L2).Thanks
