JERRY: Did you see the van back there?
LIZA: What van?
JERRY: Never mind. You'd think I was making it up.
LIZA: Where'd you get your subscribers?
JERRY: I put an ad on a computer bulletin board. I log on at the library so I can't be traced.
LIZA: Well, I've been tracking them down all morning.
JERRY: You haven't been bothering them, have you?
LIZA: They're dead. Four out of five anyhow. All in the last 24 hours. One car accident, two heart attacks and a stroke.
JERRY: Jesus... It's my fault. They drew a black line over me and now I'm passing it on. I'm passing it to you, too.
LIZA: I'll be fine. Let's worry about Henry Finch. P.O. Box in St. Louis. He's the last on the list. I haven't been able to reach him yet.
JERRY: Maybe you better not try... I worked so hard to keep quiet. Like a mouse. I should have realized.
LIZA: Realized what?
JERRY: Henry Finch. That they monitor everything. That it was only a matter of time. And now four people are dead.
LIZA: Elaborate on 'they,' okay?
JERRY: There are all kinds of groups, all kinds of initials. But they're all part of two warring factions. One: families that have held wealth for centuries. They want one thing. Stability. Group Two: the boat rockers. Eisenhower's military industrial complex. They want instability. It's a trillion dollar a year business. When there isn't a hot war, they make a cold one.
LIZA: Cold War's over, Jerry.
JERRY: So now they feed us terrorists. <u>To create fear</u>. How much do you think an airport security system goes for? Then multiply it by every airport in the country.
LIZA: And you think Group One is at war with Group Two.
JERRY: Latest casualty? Ernest Harriman. You heard of him?
LIZA: Sure. One of the richest men in America until he died a few days ago.
JERRY: His obituary was in every paper. But not one of them said he was murdered.
LIZA: Murdered?
JERRY: Right here in Manhattan.
LIZA: It said in the paper he drowned in a swimming pool. <u>In Newport</u>.
JERRY: Nobody dies in Newport. They couldn't even kill Sunny von Bulow there. Harriman drowned, but it wasn't in Newport.
LIZA: Where then?
JERRY: Right here. In the 7th Street subway station.
LIZA: What was he doing down here? A billionaire waiting for the subway? Why not drown him in a bus? Why drown him at all? Why not shoot him? Is the hitman from the lost world of Atlantis? I mean, come on.
JERRY: I see the big picture and you stumble around in the details.
LIZA: They're big details, Jerry.
JERRY: Do you watch the news? Read the paper. Last week, this whole place was underwater.
LIZA: A water main broke.
JERRY: They don't break in the summer! Do you know what building is right over this spot? Harriman Tower. Their sub-basement was flooded! He didn't die in a pool. Call the coroner in Rhode Island! Ask if the water in his lungs was chlorinated!
LIZA: Okay, I will.
JERRY: You will?
LIZA: If that's what you want. Yes.
JERRY: I don't know what to say. I love you.
LIZA: What?
JERRY: I -- It's like, I resolve to call you up 1000 times a day. To ask you if you'll marry me in some old-fashioned way. Everything you do is magic.
LIZA: Those are song lyrics, Jerry.
JERRY: I know that. I'm just -- I'm nervous. I reached out and grabbed the first thing out there. I know they're song lyrics. And I know how I feel.
LIZA: I like you, Jerry. A lot.
JERRY: Oh, Christ, here it comes. Look, I know you think I'm crazy. I don't think I am, but...
LIZA: Jerry, I --
JERRY: What if I reached a point where you didn't think I was crazy anymore? If I was normal.
LIZA: If you were eating Kentucky Fried Chicken and drinking Coca-Cola again.
JERRY: Yeah... Would you, I mean, could you love me then? If I was normal. Maybe?
LIZA: Don't do this to yourself. Jerry. You don't love me.
JERRY: You're wrong. Since I met you, I don't dream about holes anymore.
LIZA: Holes? I don't know what you're talking about.
JERRY: Yesterday you were wondering about the wall. How it was possible.
LIZA: Now's not really the time to get into this --
JERRY: It's Geronimo. Love. It lets you see things. It gives you insight. I've loved you since the first time I saw you.
