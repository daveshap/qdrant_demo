FRED: U.... What do you think?
NERVOUS TECH: That possibly... The valence bonds have shifted bi-laterally?
FRED: ... What does that mean?
NERVOUS TECH: What does that mean?!!! Yes, I see! Yes... It means that perhaps... the... bonding molecules have become covalent?!...
FRED: Covalent... Right. So...
NERVOUS TECH: So our solution is to introduce a bonding substrate! - A two molecule compound sharing a free electron - and bombard the ions with their reflective isotopes!
FRED: OK!
