FROCK: I'm coming with you.
MARGO: No, Dr. Frock. You can't.
PENDERGAST: You'd slow us down and put Margo in danger.
MARGO: Unlock one of the other storage rooms. We're going upstairs. We'll leave a trail back to 1012 and try to trap the monster in here.
FROCK: Margo, this is too dangerous. You always think you can solve everything. This time you don't have enough information. The animal might behave in unexpected ways. Leave her here with me. Don't put her in danger.
PENDERGAST: He's right.
