COLE: Lattimer sold the hoist to a guy named Bainbridge who tired to build a machine works out near Delano. Bainbridge ends up in bankruptcy court and the state winds up with the land - it's just sitting there.
NOVAK: Delano?
COLE: Yep. And guess who they hired to seal up the place?
NOVAK: You're kidding me.
COLE: I never kid. My wife hates it. Says I'm too serious.
