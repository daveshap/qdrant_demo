STEVE: Everybody says what a great benefactor you were to the Jews. But-- I have things here you said and wrote. Listen to this: 'The Jew composer Schonberg is admired by the Jewish International.' And what about this: 'Jewish musicians lack a genuine affinity with our music.' 'Jewish musicians are good businessmen with few scruples, lacking roots.' You deny you said these things?
FURTWÄNGLER: Those attitudes do not exist in me.
STEVE: I believe that. But just answer the question, don't give me explanations.
FURTWÄNGLER: Speaking to Party members I used their language, of course I did, everyone did.
