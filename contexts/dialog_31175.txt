JIM: My name's Tyler. Frank Tyler. Pleased to meet you, ma'am.
CASSANDRA: I get that feeling. You know, Mr. Tyler, I'm the kind of woman who doesn't believe men are much more than a complete waste of time. But after spying you across the room, I'm tempted to suspend my disbelief, at least for the evening.
JIM: You know, ma'am, you remind me of a pearl-handled pistol I once owned. A beautiful thing to look at, but too hot to handle.
CASSANDRA: I don't recollect ever being compared to a pistol before.
JIM: Please do. I'm a man who appreciates a good firearm.
CASSANDRA: Really?
JIM: Well, where I come from it kind of goes with the territory. Texas.
CASSANDRA: My... the wild west.
