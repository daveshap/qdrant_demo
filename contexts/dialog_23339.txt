MR. NAZLEROD: Mrs. Hinkle, did you ever receive obscene telephone calls?
DOTTIE: I certainly did.
MR. NAZLEROD: Did you recognize the voice of the caller?
DOTTIE: Not at first, but then I heard the same inflection in a voice at a social gathering and I put two and two together.
MR. NAZLEROD: Who's voice was it, Dottie?
DOTTIE: It was her! Beverly Sutphin! Sittin' right there! I'm lucky I'm not DEAD!!
MOM: Mrs. Hinkle... do you drink?
DOTTIE: No, I don't.
MOM: So you weren't drunk when you received those alleged obscene phonecalls?
DOTTIE: I certainly was not!
MOM: You mean to tell me the day I came over to Mrs. Ackerman's... the day you claim you recognized my voice... you weren't drinking?
DOTTIE: One beer with lunch is hardly drinking"."
MOM: So you do drink?
DOTTIE: Socially... I'll have a beer.
MOM: So you admit you just lied?
MR. NAZLEROD: Objection! Argumentative!
DOTTIE: NO I DON'T, YOU BITCH!
