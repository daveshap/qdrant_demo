NLP various probabilities estimators in nltk I saw there are many types of probabilities in nltk:MLE, ELE, Laplace, Heldout, KnereserNey, Lidstone, Random, WittenBel..What is the exact difference between them and when should I use each?My goal is to get the entropy of a specific sentence from the vector of probabilities. For example, once trained on a specific model, I want to compare the entropy of \"The computer is on the desk\" and \"The pen is black and old\to know which one is more likely.Thanks!
