GE washer fills, then drains 11/29/18Moved into a condo and inherited this laundry pair.I have same exact problem with the washer as OP on 02/19/18 except model # is GE GFWN1100L3WW.Washer fills with plenty of water, drum senses one or two rotations, then drains, unlocks door and flashes the pause button.No cycles run complete.I unplugged, replugged for 15 seconds.   Then tried 15 minutes.I cleaned the drain at the bottom of the machine, as well as the filters just inside the hot and cold water hoses.I changed the water inlet valve.  Still no resolution.Ran a test for error codes.  There were several.  We cleared the codes and re ran the tests.  Got an E46 (motor or control).  Called our usual repair man and he is still trying to get info on the error code fix.Any other suggestions before I give up and replace the darn thing?TIA
