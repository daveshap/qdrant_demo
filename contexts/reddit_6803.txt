When getting responses to applications, recruiters are calling and not emailing - how can I get them to email?
Hi all,

This might sound trivial but I guess I am not used to it? So last time I appleid for jobs (August 2018) in my new city on the East Coast, recruiters would email me asking for a time to set up for a phone screening.

For personal reasons, I'll be back in my hometown for 3-4 months and am just looking for filler job until I get back to my new city. I haven't gotten a single email about setting up a time to talk, rather I am just getting calls from recruiters either wanting to set up a different time or wanting to do the screening right then.

I don't like this because I am not always available to answer the phone right away and emailing gives me the time to answer when I am available. I also like to have the record of emails, in case there is any confusion.

Is there anyway for me to basically just let recruiters know/allude to the fact that I would rather an email correspondence than over-the-phone?
