FOX: Good Lord, Freddie! What have you got in there?
TREVES: You'll know presently. At the meeting of the society. But until then, I beg of you Fox, keep it to yourself.
FOX: Certainly, if you insist. You must have quite a find there.
TREVES: I don't know what I've got.
FOX: Nothing of any importance, eh?
