VERONICA: Doesn't it bother you that everyone in the school thinks you're a pirahna?
HEATHER CHANDLER: Like I give a shit. They all want me, as a friend or a fuck. I'm worshipped at Westerburg and I'm only a Junior.
VERONICA: Pretend you're a missionary saving a colony of cootie victims.
HEATHER CHANDLER: Whatever. I don't believe this. We're going to a party at Remington University tonight and we're brushing up our conversation skills with the scum of the school.
