I don't know what to use my education aid for?
 All I care about is a job with historically low unemployment and a large number of people employed. I have the option to use my aid for an Associates in art or science or aa/s for transfer, or a certificate. I think an AA/S-T is the best because then I would get the degree and could get to work right away and have the option to go for a bachelor's. I am using BLS data to make decisions. I am not following a passion, I just kind of chill. I have a criminal record of misdemeanors that are getting expunged hopefully when the courts open, and I have been committed to, so I can not look for a job that needs a gun.

I need to try for something that is not elite and super competitive.
