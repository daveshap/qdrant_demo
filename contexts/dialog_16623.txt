PETER: She came to me with a wild story about demonic possession.
SMYTHE: She's got a juvenile record from New Orleans. Parents died when she was 13.
PETER: Parents died?
SMYTHE: Yeah, murder-suicide.
PETER: What happened?
SMYTHE: Mother killed the father, then killed herself. Crime of passion.
PETER: She told me she killed them.
SMYTHE: Not what the records show. Anyway, she was a runaway, arrests for vandalism, petty theft, drugs, the whole bit. Parole records show she graduated from community college, moved into a retreat house, teaches some classes at the seminary school, hasn't been in any trouble since.
SMYTHE: We hauled her in earlier but didn't have anything hard to tie her to Townsend. Far as the priest goes, he won't be bothering you. Suffered a complete mental breakdown, during - get this - during an exorcism.
PETER: Where is she now?
SMYTHE: Had to let her go. I see you thinkin' there, superstar. Don't.
