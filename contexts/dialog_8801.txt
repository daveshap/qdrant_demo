PERCEVAL: I have found you. The Queen. An apple. Tomorrow. Sir Gawain...
LANCELOT: --It must wait, child. These good ladies, for whom I intervened once, will honor me with a meal. I am beholden to them now as I was when they begged my protection.
GUENEVERE: Why can't you be my champion?
ARTHUR: If I am your judge, I cannot be your champion. When I act as your King, I cannot be your husband.
GUENEVERE: And you cannot love me...
ARTHUR: The laws, my laws, must bind everyone, high and low, or they are not laws at all. Lancelot will come...
GUENEVERE: And if he cannot be found, no other knight will champion me, though you beseeched each and every one of them. Why be king if there is no one you can call loyal subject but an eager boy?
