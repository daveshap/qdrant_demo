GARCETTI: Danny, it's really pains me to have to tell you this, but do you remember DOMINGO, that wetback you helped us put away for trafficking a few months back?
DANNY: Yeah. What about him?
GARCETTI: Turns out he's connected.
DANNY: To who?
GARCETTI: The Mexicali Boys
DANNY: And what does this have to do with me?
GARCETTI: He knows somebody ratted him.
DANNY: What?!
GARCETTI: And he's making a lot of noise about having his homies hang a Colombian necktie on whoever it was.
