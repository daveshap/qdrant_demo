RALPH: Why, certainly, sir. My fianc√©e. Charlotte, may I present Mr. Igor.
CHARLOTTE: Delighted, I'm sure.
IGOR: If you will forgive this poor, crippled stump, my dear, I am very happy to know you.
CHARLOTTE: Thank you.
IGOR: Although you would be amused if I were to tell you that I knew you before you were born. Before this terrible thing happened to me ... ... I made a very beautiful statue. Even if I had not met with this disaster, I could never have hoped to do anything finer, probably nothing quite so fine. And, my child, you are that figure come to life. I wonder, some time, would you pose for one of my sculptors who does very excellent work?
CHARLOTTE: I'd love to, at any time.
