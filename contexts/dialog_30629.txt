GEKKO: Rarest pistol in the world, Larry, a .45 Luger. Only six were ever manufactured.
WILDMAN: Congratulations but rarer still is your interest in Anacott Steel.
GEKKO: The same interest as yours Larry. Money. I thought it'd be a good investment for my kid...
WILDMAN: No. This time I'm in for the long term. This is not a liquidation, Gordon. I'm going to turn it around. You're getting a free ride on my tail, mate, and with the dollars you're costing me to buy back the stock, I could modernize the plant. I'm not the only one who pays here Gordon. We're talking about lives and jobs; three and four generations of steel workers...
GEKKO: You must be wearing a mask you're laughing so hard behind it Larry. Let's cut the sir" crap. Correct me if I'm wrong
WILDMAN: I could break you, mate, in two pieces over my knees, you know it, I know it, I could buy you six times ever, I could dump the stock just to burn your ass but I happen to want the company and I want your block of shares. I'm announcing a tender offer at 65 tomorrow, and I'm expecting your commitment.
