ELAINE: Would you like to come in? I could make some coffee.
BEN: No, I mean -- I wouldn't want to wake anyone up.
ELAINE: We won't. Let's go inside.
BEN: Wait a minute.
ELAINE: Is anything wrong?
BEN: No -- I was just thinking -- look -- it's still early -- we could do something -- go somewhere else.
ELAINE: All right.
ELAINE: Where we going?
BEN: I'm trying to think of where there's a place to have a drink around here.
ELAINE: Isn't there one in the Taft Hotel?
ELAINE: What is the matter?
BEN: Nothing. I'm just wondering if they have a bar or not. I mean let's go see. Let's go see if they do or not.
BEN: Listen, Elaine -- it seems to me that there isn't a bar in here. I mean -- as far as I know.
ELAINE: Of course there is. Look -- The Veranda Room -- right there.
