KAREN: I wanna be on the task force, Daniel.
BURDON: That's nice of you to offer, Karen, but I got all the help I can use right now. Instead, let's talk about how you got the bump on your head.
KAREN: Isn't that my report you're holding onto?
BURDON: Yes, but I want to hear you tell it. Starting with when you tried to grab the wheel -- where was this?
KAREN: Coming to the Okeechobee exit...
KAREN: Take the next exit.
GLENN: What am I supposed to do <u>now</u>?
KAREN: Glenn, take the exit.
GLENN: No way, man, no fuckin' way am I gonna turn myself in.
