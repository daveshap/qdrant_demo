SIMON: Sorry. What are those cards?
JACKIE: Frank's idea. He thought I should have notes so I did this right... maintained focus, didn't get emotional and tried not to terrify you.
SIMON: Terrify me?
JACKIE: See, he's right. I need the cards. Simon, you're broke.
JACKIE: The medical bill are 61 thousand now. I've spoken to your parents and they didn't hang up or anything -- they just said they would feel strange calling you.
SIMON: Well, I can't reach them.
