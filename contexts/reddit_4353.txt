Am I the only person who is depressed on New Year’s Eve?
For some reason I feel... empty and a feeling of sadness. Yes this is supposed to be a happy holiday but I’m worried about what’s to come in the future. I really don’t want 2020 to be the same as 2019 so I feel a little bit pressured. Is there anything that can make me happy for this New Years? Is anyone experiencing the same thing?
