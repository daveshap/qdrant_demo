CAPTAIN ALBERT: It's noon straight up. Effective immediately, you three work desk jobs till midnight.
NENA: You can't be serious.
CAPTAIN ALBERT: Can't I?
NENA: We've been chasing this deal six months, and now you're gonna chuck it out the window?
KITTLE: Hey now, look! Let's all get on the same page here. This shipment is do or die for Zimmermann's syndicate; all or nothing. If we stop the drugs, we don't even have to catch him red-handed. He's ruined cause his pushers go broke with nothing to sell. On the other hand, if we fuck this up, it means more zombies crawling the gutters than ever and a morgue that doesn't have a single empty drawer. More old ladies getting mugged and molested by junk-hungry needle-freaks, and all the while Zimmermann's sitting back and laughing his head off.
CAPTAIN ALBERT: There'll be other chances.
KITTLE: Not like this. Are you even listening?
