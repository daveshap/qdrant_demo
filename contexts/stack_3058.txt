How does Fermat's principle of least time come from this statement? In Wikipedia Fermat's Principle is stated as:<blockquote>  A ray of light prefers the path such that there are other paths, arbitrarily nearby on either side, along which the ray would take almost exactly the same time to traverse. </blockquote>So how does the principle for shortest time come from this statement? Is there any mathematical derivation or any assumption to make?
