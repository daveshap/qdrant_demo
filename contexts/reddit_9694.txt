What to expect from an On Campus Interview
Hey everyone, 

I've just been offered my first on campus interview and I'm not sure what to expect since I've only been on the student side before (i.e. giving tours and occasionally asking a couple questions).

It's sort of a jack of all trades position- student activities, orientation, and some responsibility for the student union. Any advice/help would be appreciated!

EDIT: Thanks everyone for your help so far!
