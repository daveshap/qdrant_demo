Are there security issues in not supporting TOTP 2FA for 1Password? 1Password sort of supports 2FA. We have a master password and an additional secret. But why don't they support TOTP for 2FA?I just want to make really sure that unless I approve, no other devices can access my 1Password account.Say someone put a trojan keylogger on my computer. I don't know if I can ever detect the presence of this on my current computer.Say I open 1Password in my computer. It asks for master password that I type and I insert the key. Now, since one of my computers is compromised, the hacker knows my master password and my secret key that is not regularly changed. Isn't that dangerous?LastPass implements 2FA, it supports plenty. Why doesn't 1Password? I know their engineers are active on this site and provide answers occasionally. So that's why I am asking. I've heard 1Password is security all the way, so I thought they must have \"security\" reason why they choose to implement things this way.
