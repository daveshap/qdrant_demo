you deserve to be happy
im sorry for offending all of you that was not my intent

i had a really bad day so i was just trying to brighten yours

i may not understand the extent of what your are going through, so im sorry if wishing you well was triggering,

I apologize for any feelings ive hurt

I wasn't trying to force you to do anything

I was simply trying to wish you well

(I understand that you are upset but death threats are a little much)
