Why did a professor not have grad students for a very long time?
Hi! I have a very high expectation of a prof who is super approachable and kind. The only red flag I'm having now is that although he's a professor (not assistant nor associate), he has no previous grad student. His lab has been founded \~10 yrs. Is it normal for a lab like this? I don't have people to talk to as I'll be the first grad student if I joined the lab. Thanks!
