TOM: Fella named Spencer sent us--said they was work pickin' peaches.
COP: Want to work, do you?
TOM: Sure do.
COP: Pull up behind that car. Okay for this one. Take 'em through.
TOM: What's the matter? What's happened?
COP: Little trouble up ahead, but you'll get through. Just follow the line.
AL: Maybe the road's out.
TOM: I don't know what these cops got to do with it but I don't like it. An' these here are our own people, all of 'em. I don't like this.
