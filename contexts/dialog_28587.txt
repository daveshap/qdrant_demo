ALEXANDER: What?
OVERLORD: Go back to where you came from. Or die here.
ALEXANDER: Why would you let me go back?
OVERLORD: Because the past is immutable. Frozen. Dead... And you are the past.
ALEXANDER: Say I just come back again?
OVERLORD: Alexander, yours is a world of brocade and velvet, not tooth and claw. Why would you come back to this? To save a few cattle? No.
ALEXANDER: I could tell them. Warm them of what's to come.
