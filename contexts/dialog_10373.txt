GANDHI: And you've come all this way because you think something is going to happen?
WALKER: Hm. Is it?
GANDHI: Perhaps. I've come here to think about it.
GANDHI: Do you remember much of South Africa?
WALKER: A great deal.
GANDHI: I've traveled so far -- and thought so much. As you can see, my city was a sea city -- always filled with Hindus and Muslims and Sikhs and Jews and Persians. The temple where you were yesterday is of my family's sect, the Pranami. It was Hindu of course but the priests used to read from the Muslim Koran and the Hindu Gita, moving from one to the other as though it mattered not at all which book was read as long as God was worshipped.
