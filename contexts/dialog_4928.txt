TOM: Why?
JANE: I saw the taped outtakes of the interview with the girl. I know you 'acted' your reaction after the interview.
TOM: I felt funny about it afterwards. It's verboten, huh? I thought since I did it for real the first time -- but I get you. That's not the reason you're not coming?
JANE: Of course it's the reason. It's terrible what you did.
TOM: We disagree on how God-awful it was. Why don't you come with me and we can disagree and get a tan at the same time?
JANE: Jesus, if you're glib about this I'm going to lose it. I was up all night and...
TOM: Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane...
JANE: It made me ill. You could get fired for things like that.
TOM: I got promoted for things like that.
JANE: Working up tears for a new piece cutaway...You totally crossed the line between...
TOM: It's hard not to cross it; they keep moving the little sucker, don't they?
JANE: It just proves that the difference we have are...

So, it'd be very big deal if you stay here. The plane's boarding. You're good at deadline. Here's your ticket.
JANE: It's amazing. You commit this incredible breach of ethics and you act as if I'm nitpicking. Try and get this. When you edited that...
TOM: I'm leaving now. Gate 43.
