how to get new job after being fired..
hello! was hoping someone could help me with the current situation im in.. 

Around a month ago I was fired from my job, I had been working there around 4 months and the reasons for letting me go was that I wasn't progressing enough, my manager didn't feel he could trust me working on my own, and that the hospital didn't "have the luxury to further train me". My manager also mentioned that "my personality and everything was there and that i would be better suited to work in a bigger hospital. A little background.. Im a recent respiratory therapist (graduated in 2018) and this was my first job in the field, I had moved 8 hours away from my home town by myself so it was a pretty big risk which unfortunately didnt work out which is discouraging.. I have been applying to jobs in my field but also recently got a part time job working at a job NOT in my field for the time being...

how can i bring this up in future interviews? I want to be honest but realistically can i be hired again since this happened?

I have also been applying for jobs but not getting offered any interviews.. is the fact I only worked there for a few months a potential reason why?

thanks so much for any help!
