Applying to jobs I am underqualified for (new grad)
Hello all!

I am a recent graduate with a b.s. in biology and am currently in the process of applying to jobs for my gap year. I've mostly been applying to entry-level research jobs (research associate, research assistant, etc.). 

Even with positions that are entry level, many seem to want people who have 1-3 years of experience (which is fine because I have some research experience from internships) and expertise with specific research techniques and methodology that I haven't done before...

Should I still apply? Has anyone dealt with this type of situation?
