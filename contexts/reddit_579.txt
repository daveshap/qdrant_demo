18m uk
Hello, I just turned 18 in October and since then have been wondering what the hell i am going to do with my life. I dropped out at 10 because of anxiety and depression and my parents tried fo put me into private tutoring  but i stopped going because i was too depressed.
 Since then it's been a blur and I'm just now realising playing games in my room and fucking around with my friends will get me nowhere. 
 But the thing is I live in the wales, uk and have no idea where the fuck to start. I enrolled in a act trade school and have zero Gsce's i just don't know what the fuck to do idk what the fuck to do i am not really interested in trade jobs
