How to Support a Friend Who Might be in a Position to be Taken Advantage of?
So I have a friend in my lab who is entering her last semester of her Masters while applying to PhD programs.  She wanted to stay here at our school and enter the PhD program we are in, but our advisor essentially told her "apply elsewhere." :( It's fine because she technically wants to do research in a different field, so she went and fortunately got another professor in our department to give her a chance.

I'm happy for her, but a friend and I are worried.  Essentially, she will be working for this professor unpaid as a Masters student, on a project that two other Masters students have already failed at.  I'm confident she can succeed, but this professor has told her that the chances of getting into his lab as a PhD are "low."  My other friend who is also her friend already has a Masters and expressed concern that this professor could be using her for unpaid labor and could just as easily dump her, no matter how hard she works or whether she succeeds, at the end of the semester.  My friend even cancelled her Christmas vacation to stay here and do a literature review for the topic so she can hit the ground running next semester.  I so hope that she isn't just spinning her wheels for nothing.  She works hard and is a competent researcher who deserves to be here.

What I want to know is, in the event our worries are confirmed, how can we support her?  Do we let her know about our concerns now?  Do we say nothing to avoid putting negative thoughts in her head, and simply look for signs just in case?  If so, what are signs we could look for as outsiders looking in?  What can we do if we end up being right and come next semester's end that professor hangs her out to dry?
