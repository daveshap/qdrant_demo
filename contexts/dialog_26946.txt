CHRISTINE: Let's talk to whoever can get this over with...
NICHOLAS: Hold on... They want your driver's license number.
NICHOLAS: You've got to be kidding.
CHRISTINE: What... is... happening... ?
NICHOLAS: I was trying to tell you... it's a game.
CHRISTINE: A game?
NICHOLAS: It's run by a company... they play elaborate pranks. Things like this. I'm really only now finding out myself.
CHRISTINE: What are you talking about?
NICHOLAS: The lights went out, one hundred people all ran away...
CHRISTINE: You mean, the guy who turned blue and <u>wet</u> himself... ?
NICHOLAS: I'm sorry, about this...
CHRISTINE: You should be.
CHRISTINE: There's got to be a flashlight.
NICHOLAS: I don't understand why they're getting you involved.
