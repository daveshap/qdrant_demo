GRACE: How far is it to California?
JOHN: From here? I don't know. Far. Far enough.
GRACE: Have you ever been there before?
JOHN: Yeah.
GRACE: Is it pretty?
JOHN: Beautiful. Beautiful beaches. Blue water and clear skies as far as you can see.
GRACE: Take me with you.
JOHN: I can't.
GRACE: Please. I won't hang on you. As soon as we get there you can dump me. I don't care. I just want to get out of here.
JOHN: Grace, I can't. I can't even get out of here myself. I need a hundred-fifty bucks to get my car back from that crazy mechanic.
GRACE: I know where we could get the money. A lot more than one-hundred-fifty dollars.
JOHN: Where?
GRACE: Jake.
JOHN: You think Jake's going to give me money just so I can take you out of here?
GRACE: He doesn't give it to us. We take it.
JOHN: From?
GRACE: He's got money. In a floor safe in the living room. I've never seen it, but he talks about it all the time. More like brags. He loves his money. Wouldn't think of spending some of it on me.
JOHN: You live pretty good.
GRACE: Yeah, a bird in a gilded cage.
JOHN: How much money has he got?
GRACE: Near as I can figure must be about a hundred-thousand.
JOHN: One-hundred-thousand!? That son-of- a-bitch lied to me.
GRACE: Lied? What do you mean?
JOHN: I . . . nothing. Just something he said. So if the money's in a safe we'd have to get the combination--
GRACE: It's not a combination lock. It takes a key. He keeps it on him all the time. I mean all the time. It scratches up against me when we do it.
JOHN: If the key's on him, to get the key we'd have to . . .
GRACE: We'd have to kill him.
GRACE: John? John where are you going?
JOHN: I think this heat is making me crazy. I was crazy to come back here, I'm crazy for listening to anyone in this town, and I'd sure as hell be crazy if I spent another minute in this place.
GRACE: John, please--
JOHN: I don't know what I was thinking, but I can't do it.
GRACE: What are you talking about?
JOHN: Kill someone. I can't do it.
GRACE: Is it so bad? It would be quick. He wouldn't even have to feel it.
