HUEY: You got six months to donate to the party, Bobby?
BOBBY: You know it brother.
RODGERS: ...at least that takes Bobby Seale off the street...
HOOVER: Not good enough Rodgers. Not good enough at all. Black terrorists on the floor of a State Capitol. I will not say this again, these Negro Commies are to be stopped and now. You tear them down. Either from the outside or the inside.
RODGERS: We're working on that...
HOOVER: Work harder. And get me some results. Those Black Bastards could be up to anything.
