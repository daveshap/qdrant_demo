What should I expect from my committee members?
Hi ya'll, 

I am a first year PhD student and am starting to put together my committee. I am also doing a minor which means one of the members of my committee must be faculty in the department my minor is in. I emailed someone last week and she asked me many more questions than I had anticipated and still hasn't said yes. She also ended up wanting to schedule a phone call to discuss my career goals, my expectations of my committee members, and so I can ask her questions as well. 

I suppose this is all reasonable but my question is what are reasonable things to say you expect of your committee members? Other than showing up to meetings, providing general guidance on courses to take or conferences to attend, and being a critical but reasonable voice towards the development of my dissertation I am at a loss as to what I should expect from them? 

Does anyone have any advice? It's really causing me a lot of anxiety.....
