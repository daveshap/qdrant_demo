NIXON: Hi, Buddy. What are you doing in here?
PAT: I've missed you.
NIXON: Are you okay?
PAT: Why don't we go down to Key Biscayne together? Just the two of us.
NIXON: Because ... I have to relax.
PAT: I was thinking tonight -- do you remember, Dick? Do you remember when you used to drive me on dates with the other boys? You didn't want to let me out of your sight.
NIXON: Yeah, sure, a long time ago.
PAT: Yes, it's been a long time ...
NIXON: I don't need that, Buddy. I'm not Jack Kennedy.
PAT: No, you're not. So stop comparing yourself to him. You have no reason to ... You have everything you ever wanted. You've earned it. Why can't you just enjoy it?
NIXON: I do. I do. In my own way.
PAT: Then what are you scared of, honey?
NIXON: I'm not scared, Buddy. You don't understand. They're playing for keeps, Buddy. The press, the kids, the liberals -- they're out there, trying to figure out how to tear me down.
PAT: They're all your enemies?
NIXON: Yes!
PAT: You personally?
NIXON: Yes! This is about me. Why can't you understand that, you of all people? It's not the war -- it's Nixon! They want to destroy Nixon! And if I expose myself even the slightest bit they'll tear my insides out. Do you want that? Do you want to see that, Buddy? It's not pretty.
PAT: Sometimes I think that's what you want.
NIXON: You've been drinking. What the hell are you saying? Jesus, you sound like them now! ... I've gotta keep fighting, Buddy, for the country. These people running things, the elite ... they're soft, chickenshit faggots! They don't have the long-term vision anymore. They just want to cover their asses or meet girls or tear each other down. Oh, God, this country's in deep trouble, Buddy ... and I have to see this through. Mother would've wanted no less of me ... I'm sorry, Buddy.
