How to get off the career search merry-go-round?
I've been trying to figure out 'what to do with my life' for pretty much my entire life and it is TRULY exhausting. I am 26 years old, have a BA in Art, and work a dead-end admin job. 

I'm pretty clear on my interests/values/personality and have an idea of what I do and don't enjoy at work, and yet I continue to flit through this cycle.  I get stuck in a thought cycle looks like this:  I'm an introvert --> love science --> hate math --> psychology? --> so many barriers --> I'm creative --> need money --> get an MBA --> but I'm an introvert --> etc.

No matter what I do, or what advice I take, or how much soul searching I do, I always end up back in this cycle and I really want to get OUT. I do have genuine interest in many things so it's easy to get excited about the possibilities, but I always get stuck on the downsides and become really discouraged and rule things out.  Do anyone have any suggestions for how to break through this, especially if you have been through it too?  I have been trying to change jobs for many months with no success.
