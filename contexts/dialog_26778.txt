SARAH: Yeah. Right. How were you supposed to know? Fucking men... all you know how to do is thrust into the world with your... fucking ideas and your weapons. Did you know that every gun in the world is named after a man? Colt, Browning, Smith, Thompson, Kalashnikov... all men. Men built the hydrogen bomb, not women... men like you thought it up. You're so creative. You don't know what it's like to really create something... to create a life. To feel it growing inside you. All you know how to create is death... you fucking bastards.
JOHN: Mom, Mom, we need to be more constructive here. I don't see this as a gender-related issue. She's still tense. We still have to figure out how to stop it all from happening. Right?
TARISSA: But I thought... aren't we changing things? I mean... right now? Changing the way it goes?
DYSON: That's right! There's no way I'm going to finish the new processor now. Forget it. I'm out of it. I'm quitting Cyberdyne tomorrow... I'll sell real estate, I don't care,,,
