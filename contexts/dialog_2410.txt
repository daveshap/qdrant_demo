RICK: Well, I have to admit my game's a little rusty, but I love polo. It's unrelenting, a constant challenge to the senses. Really a beautiful experience.
MR. THOMERSON: Rick, I want to cut through the b.s.
RICK: I'd love that.
MR. THOMERSON: Good. I think you're an asshole. No, let me correct that, an immature asshole. Which is fine, except you're marrying my daughter and I'm afraid my grandchildren are going to be little assholes.
RICK: Mr. Thomerson, I...
MR. THOMERSON: Let me finish. Debbie's an adult. She can do what she wants. But if you want your marriage to last, you're going to have to change some things about yourself. If I may make some suggestions...
RICK: Feel free.
MR. THOMERSON: First, you're a slob. You have to dress for success. Second, your outlook on life...
MRS. THOMERSON: I'm using the same caterer for the shower I had for our Christmas party last year.
DEBBIE: Great, Mom.
ILENE: If I were you, I'd worry less about the shower and more about Rick's bachelor party.
DEBBIE: Ilene, why would I want to do that? I trust Rick.
ILENE: Of course you do. I trusted my ex, Mel, too. Cousin, I can only talk from experience. What do you think they do at these parties, have tea and play scrabble?
DEBBIE: Ilene, Rick promised...
ILENE: Debbie, don't be naive. Men are pigs.
MRS. THOMERSON: Girls, why don't we go inside for lunch. Boys, would you mind bringing in that lemonade?
MR. THOMERSON: In a second... And you're irresponsible. Show some initiative, try to better yourself, stop showing off, actions speak louder than words.
