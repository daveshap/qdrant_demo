Has the COVID-19 response delayed anyone else’s career path?
I know there have been a billion posts all over Reddit about COVID-19 since this started, but I was wondering if anyone else was in a similar situation as myself. To give context, I’ve been in a career for a few months now that I’m not sure I truly want to stick with forever. I wanted to find some job shadow opportunities in my area to help me try other things and guide me towards a decision to get out of my current career or not. However, all the programs and opportunities I found in my area have been cancelled or suspended due to the Coronavirus crisis, making me stuck in place for now. This is frustrating to say the least, and I want to know if the stupid Coronavirus has crapped all over anyone else’s career plans.
