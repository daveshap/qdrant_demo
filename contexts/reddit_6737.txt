Offered an in person interview, but havenâ€™t applied yet? Need help
Junior in college. Career fair today.

I was offered an interview tomorrow with a representative from a company I potentially want to work with. 

The representative texted me, confirming our interview and sent me a link to their careers page. Their careers page offers a place to apply online for the position. Should I do this now or after the interview tomorrow?
