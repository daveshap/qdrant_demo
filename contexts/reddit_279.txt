Idk
I don’t know how to live life I guess. I’m really quiet at school. I guess I have a loss of identity. I’ve been called so many fucked up things. I hated school since 3rd grade I’m a sophomore now. I’m not even going to school rn. I’ll start back next semester. I have a lot of self hate, but I know I’m a good person. I got admitted to the psychiatric hospital 2 months ago and haven’t been to school since. I don’t know how to feel better I deal with depression and anxiety. Sometimes I feel like I can’t socialize that it’s almost hate, I think that’s my depression. I sometimes get anxious if I’m quiet too long but I guess it’s kinda lonely. Part of me believes your happiness shouldn’t depend on others. Everyone kinda seems fake to me. I have trust issues because the friends I did have were shitty and made me feel bad. I can’t take criticism. I’d be alone at lunch and have no idea wtf to do. I had honors classes and ap but I thought it was stupid I had no friends. Last year I couldn’t talk to some ppl but so was still social but I had shitty friends again and my 2nd group disappeared one by one. I’m like an outcast I don’t fit in with the nerdy kids yet I’m not popular. I’m a good person if you treat me well. Also I get along with others. I am a little chubby but I’ve been going to the gym almost every day. I guess I hate myself too much to ever date. I lack confidence unless I’m only with one pers I hold up well. I guess I hate crowds. High school school sucks imo.  I feel like I just don’t fit in. I was a really happy kid until ppl made me feel bad about myself. Hurt people hurt people. I don’t know how to build my self esteem
