>How much do health insurers profit?
If we look average profit margins by industry, health insurance companies are pretty close to the bottom, with an overall average profit margin of just 3.3%. For perspective, the banking and real estate industries have profit margins that average over 20%, and major drug manufacturers average profit margins of nearly 22%.

>The ACA implemented MLR guidelines that require health insurance companies to spend the bulk of what they collect in premiums on medical claims. That automatically limits their administrative expenses - including executive compensation and profits - to no more than 20% of premium revenue.

>But there's no similar requirement for hospitals, device manufacturers, or drug manufacturers.

Seeing as (anecdotal statement) hopsitals can charge $100 for a single Tylenol is somewhat ridicules.

So what can be done via market solutions (or command) to reduce the costs to consumers placed on them by providers.

Things to think about that are costly: labor, legal, pharmaceuticals, medical equipment.

Edit: mods could you let some comments without sources stay, economics is one of those conversation topics that simply require a specific type of philosophical mindset and less source porn.
