Anyone familiar with this job model?
I was just contacted by the 2nd company that practices this business model. The short version is that they offer training for a set amount of weeks (normally 5-7) and they pay you during training. After the training you get hired on by a company for a set period of time. The first company that reached out was a company called MThree. I had to take a technical test after speaking to the recruiter. Then after you pass the test you get a technical interview. I completed all of that and afterwards hadn't heard back from them. They had told me the next training class started on April 14th and they would fly me out to Manhattan. 

Today a company called Mobile Consulting Solutions. This company offered training in android development and this time in Atlanta Georgia. This test wasn't as difficult but he immediately called me back and told me I passed and went over specifics of the job. We set up for a Skype interview tomorrow (4/25/2019).

Has anyone ever accepted an offer from them? I was really looking forward to that Mthree position but oh well. The model sounds good in theory there's just a certain skepticism about it. I'm getting desperate in my job search though so I'm thinking of taking it.
