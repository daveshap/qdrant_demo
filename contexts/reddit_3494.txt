Man, I really miss being in love.
Cuffing season’s just around the corner and it’s probably going to be another Christmas as single. 

I’m tired. Tired of talking, tired of wasting energy, tired of fake ass people, tired of getting excited for an extremely short period of time, tired of meaningless hookups that make me feel even more lonely afterwards, tired of being seen as just an object, just very tired of being alone and not having someone who’s genuinely interested.

Edit: this post didn’t explode or anything but it did get a lot more attention than I thought it would because it was just a spur of the moment rant thing. Just wanted to thank everyone for their kind words, stories and making me (27F) feel less alone about this. Really warms my heart :)
