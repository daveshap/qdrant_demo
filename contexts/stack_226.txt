iTunes attempts to mount SMB share using old SMB server name mac OS High Sierra 10.13.6 (17G65) and iTunes 12.8.0.150I have a bunch of MP3 files on my SMB share (a Linux home server). The SMB server used to be named \"sega-SMB\" and I renamed it to just \"sega\".The problem with iTunes is that if I don't connect to the \"sega\" SMB server and mount the share (its name never changed) in Finder before attempting to start playing any song that is on this \"sega\" SMB server, iTunes attempts to connect to the old \"sega-SMB\" name. It errors out saying that it can't connect to the server. It is not lying. The \"sega-SMB\" server is not on the network anymore. There's only \"sega\" now.So, iTunes somehow cached the old SMB server name. If I first connect to the SMB server and mount the share via Finder and then try to play a song in iTunes, it has no problem figuring out the path to an MP3 file. Basically, if I just logged in and started iTunes and want to play music it attempts to connect to my SMB server using old name that is no longer valid. If I connect via Finder and mount the share, iTunes has no problem playing the music.I was wondering if there's a way to delete this cached record somehow, somewhere. I've been searching for a solution on Google but haven't been able to find anything yet.I tried clearing all recent connections in \"Connect to Server\" dialog. I also tried deleting obsolete keychain entries. None of that helped.
