ADAM: Hi!
MISS SWEET: Yes?
ADAM: I was wondering if you might help me. I...I seem to have lost my Congressional Medal of Honor somewhere around here.
MISS SWEET: Oh, now, that's a great one!
ADAM: You like it?
MISS SWEET: Bravo!
ADAM: Thank-Q!
MISS SWEET: This is my new friend...
ADAM: I'm Adam Webber.
MISS SWEET: He's really funny!
