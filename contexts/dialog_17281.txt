NEO: How did you do that?
TRINITY: Right now, all I can tell you, is that you are in danger. I brought you here to warn you.
NEO: Of what?
TRINITY: They're watching you, Neo.
NEO: Who is?
TRINITY: Please. Just listen. I know why you're here, Neo. I know why you left your family and your friends, why you left your home to come to this city. You're looking for him.
