First Year Programs Interview Help
Hi all! I am currently halfway through my Masters program in Higher Ed Administration. For this course I am currently enrolled in, I need to interview someone in the field I'm interested in going into. I cannot use someone from my undergrad or the institution I am enrolled at, unfortunately. So I am looking to see if any of you all would be willing to help! I would be looking to interview on July 21st or so (somewhat flexible) and have pre-approved questions I would be asking. I am willing to work with you on Skype, email, Zoom, whatever!! 

Please let me know if you work in FYP (or know someone who does) and would be willing to help me out with a quick interview. Thank you so much!!
