GERMAN: Vincent...Vincent...
VINCENT: German, is that you?
GERMAN: Vincent, come down. I've found him.
GERMAN: He has the heart of an ox. He could run through a Goddamn wall--if he could still run. Actually, he was a big college swimming star.
VINCENT: I hope he's not just a body.
GERMAN: No problem. Before he dropped out he was an honor student, the right majors--
VINCENT: How do I square the accident?
GERMAN: It happened in Australasia. He checked in yesterday. No family complications, no record he ever broke his neck. As far as anybody's concerned, he's still a walking, talking, fully-productive member of society. You just have to get him off the pipe and fill in the last two years of his life. Excuse me, <i>your</i> life.
