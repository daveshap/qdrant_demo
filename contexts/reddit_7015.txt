Calling in sick with 2 days in between
So I have the stomach flu currently, most likely from New Years Eve Dinner, and been getting barely any sleep the past few days due to cramps and needing to go to the washroom throughout the night. I currently work as a part time employee, and I have called in sick 2 days prior to today (I was not scheduled for Thursday and Friday to be clear), but had a friend of mine cover for me. I am not feeling any much better today, but does anyone have any input if it would jeopardize my job if I called in sick again today?
