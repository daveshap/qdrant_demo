GRANT: What can I do for you, Mr. Kirby?
PAUL: Well sir, I am a great admirer of yours, and I have an extremely interesting proposition to discuss. Would you let my wife and I take you to have dinner tonight? Our treat.
GRANT: You know, I've been traveling and I'm very tired. Maybe some other time.
PAUL: I guarantee it'll be worth your while.
