JACKIE: Just a little, when we were looking up information about William's father. How did he help?
LORENSON: It's complicated, but [looking at Starks] in a way, your father let me know how I'd get through to him.
JACKIE: How?
LORENSON: He just said...that I'd shock Eugene and then things would change for him.
JACKIE: I don't understand.
LORENSON: I still don't either, even after all these years.
