I called a hotline last week, now I owe thousands.
20m here. Tried overdosing last week but I still woke up. Then I called the hotline cause I needed someone to talk to. I thought it would be like free therapy. Boy was I wrong. Told them what happened, even gave them a fake name and location but the person on the other line deemed that I was a risk to myself. They got the info by pulling up the provider from the phone I was calling from and going to the address listed. Since I moved out, they actually ended up at my parents house while my brother was home and tried to find me there. My heart sank when my brother called me cause I pretty much SWAT'd him just then. The popo called me and I told them my address, they left my brother alone and two paramedics with two officers came to my unit after. They told me I needed to come with them and they would bring me by force if necessary.
Now for context; my mountain of debt, a car accident, and getting fired from several jobs in a row without any potential future prospects all led me to a suicidal state of mind that day. When the ambulance pulled up my heart sank again cause guess what? I have zero insurance.

I voluntarily go with the EMTs, stayed in an emergency room for 8 hours, then was discharged. 

Fast forward to now and I just opened up a letter in the mail for the invoices from the hospital to the tune of three grand. 

I've been pretty stable since then but seeing that letter this morning caused a violent stress induced break down. Some nights I think about how if I haven't sought help from the hotline that day I might be better off than I am today. Maybe alive or dead, but probably better off either way. I feel intense regret for trying to connect with someone. I didn't leave a suicide note that day. I probably won't ever leave a note when I go. Ideally, id just fade away.
