DIANE: I'm supposed to be leaving on a fellowship that I worked for my entire life. I don't even care. I met this boy over the summer, and I, I can't see him because of this, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to my father about... I wore these clothes, I thought, I thought that if I looked right and if I acted right then someone would talk to me. But I look awful and I feel awful, could you, could you please talk to me? Be a little decent.
AGENT: We believe that your father operates in a large pool of cash that comes from phoney billings, phoney patients. We've been investigating him for five years. We believe that when they die, he takes their money.
DIANE: Pardon me?
AGENT: Look, why don't you check it out for yourself? See if your father fits the profile.
DIANE: What's the profile?
AGENT: Well, take a look around the house. Is everything nice, but not too nice? Are there lots of, uh, rugs, pieces of art, stereo equipment, uh, furniture, a lot of things bought with cash? Does he give a lot of gifts? Do the major items in your house cover around the nine thousand-dollar range?
DIANE: You're trying to get me to say something, that's why you're telling me all of this.
AGENT: Don't let your father's business infect your life.
DIANE: How can you, how can you say that?
AGENT: Because he's guilty.
DIANE: No, no he's not.
AGENT: We have records. We have proof. I'm sorry to be the one to have to tell you this, but it's going to get worse. Now, if I were you, I would take that fellowship.
