Idk how to come out....
I'm a closeted lesbian  most of family always look away and avoid when it comes to family being anything besides straight especially from the ones I'm close to.

I want to tell my mother (She is a lot more open minded) but I don't know how to really since I'm bad at bringing up things to talk about  & Don't want it to get out ...

Any advice?
