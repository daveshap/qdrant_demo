ALEXANDER: Mara, I had a strange dream last night. I was here, walking through a forest very much like this, and then...
MARA: Then you came to a desert and mountains...
ALEXANDER: Yes.
MARA: And you saw a shape ahead of you...
ALEXANDER: Yes!
MARA: We all have that dream.
ALEXANDER: All of you?
MARA: Every night.
ALEXANDER: You share dreams? That's incredible.
MARA: We share everything.
