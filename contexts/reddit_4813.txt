Survey on People's Attitudes Towards Therapy Delivered Via the Internet (Everyone 18+)
Hi, I'm doing a research project that aims to understand people's attitudes and preferences towards therapy delivered via the internet. The survey will ask you about your current eating patterns, body image concerns, current technology use, and attitudes and preferences towards e-therapy (online-delivered therapy). If you have some time, I'd really appreciate it if you can fill out the survey below. Only non-identified group data will be reported and may be presented at conferences or published in peer-reviewed journals.

You only need to be 18+ and everyone is welcome! The survey will take 10-15 minutes to complete. Thank you! ðŸ§¡
