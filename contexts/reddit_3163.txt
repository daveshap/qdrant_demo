What is a decent job that only requires a 1-year training program?
 Hi, I am asking for a friend who is interested in immigrating from Vietnam to Canada. They have a Masters Degree in Chemistry, but that certification won't directly transfer over. So they are looking to enroll in a 1-year study program, which can be converted into a 1-year work visa and build up language/cultural skills, pay off rent and tuition, then eventually transition to a long term career.

25 year old female, introverted. 2yrs work experience in an office, admin work.

Preferred job types:

* "Technician" type of jobs that can take advantage of a scientific background
* Like working with people
* This is an example 1-year program that works: Food Quality Assurance Technician[https://www.conestogac.on.ca/fulltime/food-safety-and-quality-assurance-food-processing](https://www.conestogac.on.ca/fulltime/food-safety-and-quality-assurance-food-processing)
* Ultrasound / Pharmacy /Blood Technician / Dental Hygienist / Massage Therapist would be great but they all **require 2+years of school** which is too much time/money.
* Something like bartending would be good, but it isn't a legitimate 1 year college program so you cant get a study permit for it

Open to many ideas as there are always so many jobs out there that we never think of!

Non-preferred Job types:

* Not coding
* Not manual labour (no construction, roofing, garbageman, oil rig, auto garage etc.)
* No citizenship / drivers license required (not military, not air hostess, not bus/truck driver)
* Must cost $15000 or less in tuition... this is many years worth of savings in foreign currency
* Must be a 1-year study program
