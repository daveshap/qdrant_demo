What are the crime rates of refugees in Europe? Especially Germany.
Greetings,

I've been trying to find information about crime rates amongst refugees in mostly Germany, but I will be thankful for any European country. 

I was able to find some articles and [in an earlier post on this subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/5sjoak/what_is_the_truth_behind_the_claims_of_an/) there was data about the Danish crime rates. 

I was able to find some articles [here,](http://www.dw.com/en/report-refugees-have-not-increased-crime-rate-in-germany/a-18848890) [here](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/refugees-responsible-for-tiny-proportion-of-sex-crimes-in-germany-despite-far-right-claims-following-a6884166.html) and [here](https://www.ft.com/content/b5a8867e-28ea-11e7-bc4b-5528796fe35c?mhq5j=e3), but they do not give pure data, I don't feel as if I'm presented the whole truth if all I get is general % increase in comparison to X and quotes, it seems like data presented in a very biased way. 

I understand that it might be slightly too much to ask, this data might not be released to the public, but I thought I'd ask anyway. 

The second question I just had to add was is there any information as to how many of them are "opportunists" (people who were doing fine in their country, but saw this as a way of improving their life) and how many are war victims? Since I've heard many claims that most of them are these so-called opportunists [here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/migrants-are-disguising-themselves-as-syrians-to-gain-entry-to-europe/2015/09/22/827c6026-5bd8-11e5-8475-781cc9851652_story.html), [here](http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2015/09/economist-explains-4) and [here](http://www.ibtimes.com.au/syrian-refugee-crisis-being-used-opportunists-cory-bernardi-1465187) but I'm not sure if there is any merit to that claim.

Thank you for reading my questions.
