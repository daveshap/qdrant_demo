Crying over nothing.
Does anyone else not want to go outside and if they do end up having to talk to someone feel like crying. Last month or so I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety (while already having ADHD diagnosis at 1st grade) and I've not wanted to leave my apartment or go to class and I hate it. I went to class the other day and talked to my teacher about what's been going on and why I've missed class and I almost cried in front of her... Whenever I go out and about to get groceries I feel like there is a tickle in my eyes as if I want to cry and just go home. I used to never really do this, I used to never cry in public, it's just very weird to me...
