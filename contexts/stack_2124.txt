Hammer Editor - Adding C.S (TTT) Weapons to HL2 Base I have finally figured out how to use hammer editor. I opened it up and started creating maps on the Half Life 2 \"Base\". However, I am making the map for TTT for Garry's Mod, which I presume uses Counter Strike weapons like the sniper and the shotgun. How do I get Counter Strike weapons into the Half Life 2 base map I am working on?I do not own any Counter Strike games.
