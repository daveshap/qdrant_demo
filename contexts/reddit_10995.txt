I tried to kill myself last night and failed.
As of yesterday I was on day 8 off all opiate medication. For years I had drug abuse issues, but went on a methadone than suboxone program. I recently came off it and was struggling with withdrawals. Last night I went and bought 20 8mg dilaudid pills crushed them up put them into a needle and shot it into my arm. I had about 10 seconds where I thought should I call 911 do I really want this, and than everything faded. I woke up 10 hours later with 30 missed calls from my parents , ex girlfriend and my only friend. All who had contacted each other knowing something was wrong, as I wasn’t answering my phone and was going thru withdrawals .
I passed out in my backseat looking out at the ocean as that’s where I have grown up , and that’s what I wanted to look at last . I called my dad crying , I could hardly talk I could hardly see and I was to weak to stand up. Im not sure how I survived as my tolerance is extremely low at this point . But I did. I felt shame and embarrassment this morning , I wasn’t looking for attention . I just wanted my physical and mental pain to end.
But I’m not feeling shame tonight , I feel lucky to be alive, and thankful to those who care about me. Anyone contemplating suicide , ask someone to talk call a friend, fuck go to a hospital. I love you all , and I hope anyone going thru shit, will get thru it.
Peace and Love
