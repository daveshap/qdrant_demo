Do you ever just feel angry?
I woke up today feeling angry. Angry at nothing and everything. I know I need to meditate and chill out and prepare myself for a busy day...but I just want to sit here on reddit and figure out my brain. I want to listen to music and to the birds.

So lets all try to give ourselves a break when we start to feel upset, aggrivated and like you need to go run away/hide/jump out a window.

Breathe and remember that you are a STRONG, BEAUTIFUL human being that can be happy.

I have been trying to forgive myself as well as others today.

I wish you all a peaceful day!
