Does white privilege exist in the United States?
What evidence is there that [white privilege](https://www.mtholyoke.edu/org/wsar/intro.htm) does or does not exist? When you look at [statistics](http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/p13.pdf) on their surface, it seems as though there is a racial bias, if nowhere else, in our court systems. An argument that I have heard is that it's an issue of [poverty](http://www.npc.umich.edu/poverty/) and not race, as black people are impoverished in higher proportions than white people. However, this seems to further the idea of white privilege since there is no reason that a black person would be inherently prone to poverty. Even with all of this considered, wouldn't there have to be some type of policy or law that would lend itself to these facts?

I must admit I think I am quite ignorant on this topic. So I don't know if the idea of "white privilege" is legitimate or not, or what the further facts on this subject are. I hear it mentioned quite frequently so I would like some unbiased and fact based opinions on this. I'm sure I am missing something.
