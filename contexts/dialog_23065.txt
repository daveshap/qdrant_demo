DEWEY: Billy was released. His cellular bill was clean. He didn't make those calls.
SIDNEY: Somebody called me, Dewey. I'm not making it up.
DEWEY: I know. We're checking every cellular account in the county. Any calls made to you or Casey Becker are being cross-referenced. It's gonna take time but we'll find him.
SIDNEY: And my Dad? Any word on him?
