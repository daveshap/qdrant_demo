DR. DRAYTON: Try to communicate with her somehow.
CLAIRE: You think that'll help?
DR. DRAYTON: Can't hurt. And I think it's important you find out what she wants.
CLAIRE: Are you humoring me?
DR. DRAYTON: Nope.
CLAIRE: How?
DR. DRAYTON: I don't know. My aunt used to use my uncle's old pajamas and a candle.
