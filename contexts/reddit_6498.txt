Question about PTO?
Hello, 
My company is running tight on work for everyone and so now to get your guaranteed hours, you would work Sunday-Saturdaly. If they ask you to work on Saturday (by having a day off during the week)  and you decline., you are not able to use your PTO to get paid for hours you are short by. Is the company allowed to deny us using PTO like that?

Appreciate the feedback!
