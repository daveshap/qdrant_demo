Experience without experience?
I graduated with a bachelor’s in public health with a focus on health education over 2 years ago (April 2017) and have not found a job yet. I’ve had several interviews, but I never get it because the only experience I have is 4 months of an internship with a non-profit. I got a job as a substitute teacher to try and get some experience in some way, but all that is leaving me with is experience as a teacher. I feel like giving up. I don’t know what to do anymore. How do I get experience? How do I make myself sound worth it enough to take a chance on me?
