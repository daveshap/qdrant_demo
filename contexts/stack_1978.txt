Word for people who are led by a leader Just like the pairs Interviewer &amp; Interviewee or Employer &amp; Employee, is there any word for leader?Say the word is x. I'm trying to construct a statement where I have to say that, \"A leader needs to be both gregarious and exemplary to inspire the x\".The sentence could possibly be rephrased to avoid the word that I'm looking for. But I want to know if such a word exists.
