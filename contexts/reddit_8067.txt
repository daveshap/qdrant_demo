Debt debt, crippling debt
So I want to go to grad school because I feel like I’m at a stalemate in my life. I’m not exactly in the field I want to be in (let’s say it’s adjacent to it) and the jobs I want I don’t feel like I’m experienced enough for. 

I love learning and I love going to school. I just graduated in May and I miss it so much already. I’ve looked at a couple programs and I have found three I really like. 

The only problem is $$$. 

I’m already in debt, like $36k and thinking about putting myself more in debt makes me want to jump off a cliff (which I do like to cliff jump sometimes for fun). 

Anyways, am I crazy to want to go back? How much in debt are you?
