INGA: Yes, I know.
FREDDY: It wouldn't be fair to her.
INGA: Yes, I know.
FREDDY: You've got to help me to remain faithful.
INGA: Yes, I will.
FREDDY: ...But an intellectual relationship, like this -- we could have as often as we wanted. Three times a day -- anything!
BURGOMEISTER: Frederick Frankenstein?
FREDDY: You have the wrong house.
BURGOMEISTER: And who might you be?
FREDDY: Dr. Frederick Fronkonsteen.
BURGOMEISTER: The grandson of Victor 'Fronkonsteen'?
FREDDY: No!
BURGOMEISTER: What was your grandfather's name?
FREDDY: Victor Frankenstein.
BURGOMEISTER: Forgive me for intruding so late at night, Herr Baron. But an ugly rumor has it that there are strange goings on in this castle. These good citizens are ready to rip you from limb to limb unless you can offer some rational explanation for their fears. How say you?
FREDDY: Ugly, vicious rumous.
BURGOMEISTER: They say, also, that you have recreated the horrible monster who, for so many years, has haunted and terrorized the God-fearing people of this village. What say you to that?
FREDDY: Poppycock!
