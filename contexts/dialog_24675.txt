VICTOR: At least somebody’s using the damn thing. I was gonna fix her up but we took one trip and the kids fought so much, we never launched her again.

KAT: So you’re telling me. If something had happened last night...it would have cost me fourteen hundred dollars? That’s a down payment on a Ford Focus!
NICK: Not dollars. Pounds.
