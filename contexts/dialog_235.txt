HAL: If you're determined to revive the crew now, I can handle the whole thing myself. There's no need for you to trouble.
BOWMAN: I'm goin to do this myself, Hal. Let me have the control, please.
HAL: Look, Dave your've probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me.
BOWMAN: Hal, switch to manual hibernation control.
HAL: I don't like to assert myself, Dave, but it would be much better now for you to rest. You've been involved in a very stressful situation.
