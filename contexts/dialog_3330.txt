ALLENBY: Chauncey, there you are. What are you doing on that leg?
CHANCE: It's fine today, Robert.
ALLENBY: Shame on you, Chauncey - you should let me be the judge of that. Please, sit in the chair.
ALLENBY: I swear, Chauncey, between you and Benjamin, I've got my hands full... ... Say, that is coming along, the swelling has gone down considerably... ... Any pain here?
CHANCE: Yes, Robert. But it's not bad.
ALLENBY: ... Benjamin has been hounding me to allow him to address the annual meeting of his Financial Institute today, but obviously, the strain would be impossible... How about here, Chauncey, any soreness?
CHANCE: Hardly any, Robert.
