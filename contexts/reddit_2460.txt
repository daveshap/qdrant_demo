Will remote offices become the new standard?
I feel like more and more companies are shifting toward a remote-centric culture and I'm worried traditional offices won't exist anymore.

I hate working remotely. I can't focus, I hate having to stay in my house all day, I hate the lack of social interactions (despite being a socially anxious introvert), and I feel like I am missing out on a lot of perks.

Where I work, they have a lot of free food around the office, which had allowed me to save A TON of money on groceries when I was working there as an intern, and now I don't have access to that anymore. I was relying on onboarding to make new friends outside my department, but I doubt it'll be happening now. How are you supposed to make friends on Zoom and Slack?

Everyone else seems to love it, but I need the structure of an office. I'm *less* productive when I'm at home and I actually don't mind a commute. It allows me to separate home life from work life. When I'm working from home, those lines become blurred. That, combined with the fact that I end up having to work longer hours because of my lack of productivity, makes me feel like I'm always at work. My house is no longer a place of relaxation, it's all stress. I don't think co-working spaces are an option either. It's like working alone at the library except it's insanely expensive.

Does anyone else feel the same way? Am I in a minority?
