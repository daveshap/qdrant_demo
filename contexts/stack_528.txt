Ubuntu installer seems to have broken my chipset raid array I have a Gigabyte GA F2A88XM-D3H Motherboard. Using the AMD chipset raid ROM, I had 3 drives set up as a RAID 5 and a fourth drive as the global hot spare. (I've had the array forever, yes I know chipset raid is not great, and raid 10 is better). I was running windows on the boot drive, and I got another hard drive to install Ubuntu 16.0.4. I removed the old boot drive, installed the new one, and left the RAID drives untouched. After installing Ubuntu, I noticed that the RAID drives were now showing up as individual drives. I went into the option ROM, and saw that while the RAID array is still in the array list, the drives are showing up as non-raid, single drives.I put the windows boot drive back in, and now I see that the RAID chipset is displaying 3 separate drives instead of the array.I'm a little surprised that in installing, it would mess with a drive other than the one its installing on. Any idea what happened? or how to revert it?
