JUNO: This is Samir. See if you can guess his specialty.
HARRY: Oral hygiene?
JUNO: Not exactly.
HELEN: What's going on, Harry?
JUNO: Samir is just going to ask Harry a few questions. See, we're not even sure which agency Harry works for. Now, Samir is absolutely first class, but on the other hand we have Harry, here, who has managed to lie convincingly to the woman he loves for 15 years. So it will be interesting to see how long he can resist.
