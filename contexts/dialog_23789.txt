MILES: You know what? Let's take the Santa Rosa turnoff and hit Sanford first.
JACK: Whatever's closest, man. I need a glass.
MILES: These guys make top-notch Pinot and Chardonnay. One of the best producers in Santa Barbara county. Look how beautiful this view is. What a day!
JACK: I thought you hated Chardonnay.
MILES: I like all varietals. I just don't generally like the way they manipulate Chardonnay in California -- too much oak and secondary malolactic fermentation.
