MICKEY: Been a long time, huh...?
GALVIN: I'm getting it back. Don't worry about me, Mick. I'm fine. D'you find the obstetric nurse?
MICKEY: Mary Rooney. She won't talk to me. I tried her at the hospital. I'm going to try her back at home. Read this.
GALVIN: So what?
MICKEY: So what...? The best is yet to come. Check the TV Guide. They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.'
GALVIN: They still have to take it to a jury.
MICKEY: What I'm saying, they're getting some help.
GALVIN: So what do you want me to do? Concannon's going to try the case his way, I'm going to try it mine. You want me to go wee wee wee all the time because he's got some flack, got stories in the newspaper. I'm going to win this case.
MICKEY: John: gimme a cuesta-ray.
GALVIN: Oh shit, what's today?
MICKEY: Today is Tuesday. What?
GALVIN: I've got to go see Gruber. What's the best cigars you have?
MICKEY: Give 'em a box of Macanudos.
GALVIN: Mickey: I'm supposed to meet somebody at O'Rourke's, I can't make it.
