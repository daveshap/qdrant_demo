On having no friends in your 20s
The schedule is always the same: you work 55 hours each week and work out 15 more. You eat takeout at your desk. You stare – blankly – at others from whom you feel depersonalized and disassociated. They stare back. They glare back. They retch and recoil. You go home and eat more takeout and stare some more – at the wall, at the ceiling, out the window. You watch the world turn. You regret. You speak to yourself and diagnose yourself and add and subtract and divide and grind your teeth and lament and-

Nothing changes. You stare down and seek reprieve in the rug. You hug your knees and smoke a hundred cigarettes. You exercise again and read a little. You return to work and lie about your weekend plans and your mental health. You hope and dash those hopes. You wait and pray. You shower too long. You eat too little. You never sleep.

You resolve. You plot. You choose the tools. You cradle them and know you can end it in minutes. You cower and retreat, and it comes in waves and you attempt again but flee again too. You cannot tell anyone. You cannot hug anyone. There’s no one to hug.

Your parents and grandparents age. They inquire ceaselessly after your condition. You lie again. You say things are fine, the social life survives, you enjoy work. You enjoy nothing. You drink. You smoke. You masturbate. You cry some more.

Nothing changes. Spring fills fragrant the air and summer brings its heavy trod. The autumn wind bites and the weeks stretch on. The days grow longer then shorter again. The walk is the same. The work is the same. The nights are the same. The sun and moon and stars and horizon are the same. You are the same.

Nothing changes.
