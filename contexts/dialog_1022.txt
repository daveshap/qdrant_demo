BIRDIE: You all put together?
MARGO: My back's open. Did the extra help get here?
BIRDIE: There's some loose characters dressed like maids and butlers. Who'd you call - the William Morris Agency?
MARGO: You're not being funny, I could get actors for less. What about the food?
BIRDIE: The caterer had to back for hors d'oeuvres- Voila.
MARGO: That French ventriloquist taught you a lot, didn't he?
BIRDIE: There was nothing he didn't know. There's a message from the bartender. Does Miss Channing know we ordered domestic gin by mistake?
MARGO: The only thing I ordered by mistake is the guests. They're domestic, too, and they don't care what they drink as long as it burns... where's Bill? He's late.
BIRDIE: Late for what?
MARGO: Don't be dense. The party.
BIRDIE: I ain't dense. And he's been here twenty minutes.
MARGO: Well, I certainly think it's odd he hasn't even come up...
