GRAHAM: Hi, John.
JOHN: Where are the tapes, Graham?
GRAHAM: What tapes?
JOHN: You know which tapes! Where are they?
GRAHAM: John, as a lawyer, you should know that those tapes are private property.
JOHN: So is my wife, asshole!!
GRAHAM: She's not property, John, she's a person. Were you just going to keep right on lying to her?
JOHN: What the hell do you think? I love Ann. You think I'm going to tell her about Cynthia and hurt her feelings like that?
GRAHAM: God, you need help.
JOHN: I need help? Whose sitting by himself in a room choking his chauncey to a bunch of videotapes, Graham? Not me, buddy. You're the fucking nut. Now show me those tapes.
GRAHAM: No.
JOHN: I'm not kidding, Graham, you'd better do what I say. Give me those tapes.
GRAHAM: No.
JOHN: Graham, I swear to Christ I'll kill your scrawny ass. Now give me those tapes.
GRAHAM: No.
