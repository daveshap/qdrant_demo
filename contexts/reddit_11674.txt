Cheated on my girlfriend after my friend died
My friend died earlier this month. I'm traveling in another country and couldn't come home to be with my friends. I've completely isolated myself from them and can't talk about it.

I've drunk myself stupid almost every night since. My girlfriend is amazing, I want to marry her but the other night I was so blackout that I woke up beside a stranger.

She doesn't fucking deserve that. If I tell her, she'll leave me and all of our friends at home will disown me. I'll have nothing to go home to.
