Feedback on Manuscript Feels Superficial
I’m starting a PhD program in Ecology this fall and really want to try to publish some undergrad work this summer since I don’t anticipate having time once I start grad school... but I feel I lack the experience and support necessary to get the manuscript into a publishable condition. 

The field/lab portion of the study have relatively low sample sizes as they were completed entirely by myself over the course of 2 months during one summer (through an NSF REU program). Without going into too much detail, the field study was plagued with issues outside of my control and ultimately the data and hence the manuscript feel lackluster and ambiguous. However, besides cleaning up the discussion section and some basic formatting, it’s a completed manuscript.

Now my advisor has suggested we completely remove the field study from the manuscript. It was not intended to be a standalone study and without the field experiment, it loses any context that MIGHT make it meaningful. Not to mention that I’d have to rewrite most of the manuscript if we proceed with the lab study only. The whole thing feels like a garbage fire and the edits I’ve received are minor and almost entirely stylistic. I’m not making real progress and don’t know how to get the guidance I need to make progress and this feels like a huge waste of time. 

My advisor and I only communicate via email due to geographic distance and the longest email I’ve received from him in the past year has been around 5 short sentences. This is by far the worst research I’ve ever done, and it doesn’t feel valuable or publishable, but I nonetheless feel obligated to press forward with it because I’m not the only one involved and my advisor seems to think it’s publishable. However, I lack the experience and guidance to actually move forward. Any advice (or commiseration) would be appreciated.
