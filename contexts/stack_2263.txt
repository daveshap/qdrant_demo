How can I get get a fellow federation member to convert their tributary into a member of our federation in Stellaris? I recently formed a federation with several other members in my corner of the galaxy. One of the members has a tributary who I have a very good relationship (>100) with (both with the tributary and the overlord).Unfortunately, I'm beginning to have border friction with the tributary and I'd like to remove it by making them a federation member. (As well as working towards a victory).I'm wondering if there is a way I can get the other federation member to either let the tribute join the federation as a full member or to convert them to something so they count as part of their empire.Does anyone have any advice about how I could make this happen? I'd like to convert them somewhat soon as well.
