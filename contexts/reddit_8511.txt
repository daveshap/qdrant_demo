Have Democrats specifically stated their objectives in obtaining President Trump's tax returns? Could malign financial activity be hidden, even from Trump's tax returns?
Democrats have [long sought](https://www.npr.org/2016/08/12/489776309/in-an-effort-to-pressure-trump-clinton-releases-tax-rate) Donald Trump's tax returns, both as [candidate](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/12/us/politics/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-tax-returns.html) and as [President](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-tax-return-battle-begins-090000490.html).

I understand the basic idea that illegal financial activity might be exposed in his returns, but I have a couple of questions on the topic:

1: Have Democrats outlined their objectives for any probe into Trump's taxes?

2: Could illegal activity that Donald Trump has personally partaken in be hidden, even with his tax returns? Another way of saying, if Donald Trump's tax returns are clean, is he personally clean too?
