HUNTER: What did you do then?
SUZIE: Shit, what difference does it make... Nobody's gonna believe me anyway...
HUNTER: Suzie! Did this man rape you?
SUZIE: Okay! He did. He pushed me to the floor and he did it to me. Now, can I go home?
GLORIA: At that point were you able to fight him off?
SUZIE: No. He stopped by himself. Okay? That's all. Let me go.
