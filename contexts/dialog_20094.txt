LYNETTE: You serious about having him over?
PAULA: I haven't made up my mind.
LYNETTE: Paula, how far would you go to catch Zack?
PAULA: What do you mean?
LYNETTE: You know what I mean. Would you... let yourself get pregnant?
PAULA: No way... Would you?
LYNETTE: I never used to think I'd do something like that, but now I'm not so sure. You ask me, nine weeks just ain't long enough to get a guy to fall in love with you.
PAULA: That don't justify trying to trap a boy by getting pregnant, Lynette! Nothing justifies that. I can't believe you're even thinking like that. I mean, that's really backward.
LYNETTE: No more backward, if you ask me, than the way these hotshot assholes fuck us, then ditch us. Don't you ever feel used, Paula? Don't you ever feel like if this is all you get for your trouble then the sonofabitch ought to be paying for it...?
PAULA: No. I never feel like that.
LYNETTE: I do.
