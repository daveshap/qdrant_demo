Voltage regulator with heatsink gets overheated First of, I'm sorry if I'm using the wrong terms or if I'm pointing out something that is obvious to most, this is not my profession, it's only a hobby.I have an input voltage of 12V 5A which is needed for a water pump. I'm trying to use the same source too drive a Raspberry PI Zero W together with a bunch of sensors. To lower the voltage to 5V I'm using a voltage regulator, L78S05CV, which I had lying around. It should be able to give me 2A but currently I'm only needing about 0.27A.The voltage regulator has a heatsink with a thermal resistance of 29 \u00b0C/W and the regulator has a thermal resistance from junction to case of 5 \u00b0C/W (Rthj-a of 50 \u00b0C/W). The regulator dissipate around 1.89W ((12 - 5) * 0.27), which would mean around 64 \u00b0C ((29 + 5) * 1.89). Assuming an air temperature of 25 \u00b0C it should end up at around 90 \u00b0C. The regulator should have a operating junction temperature of up to 150 \u00b0C.Still I do belive that the regulator gets overheated after some time, I can see a drop in voltage to about 2.5V.I am trying to understand the math here, to see if I need another heatsink with a better thermal resistance or if I should just look at other alternatives.I have read several other responses to similar threads, but too be honest, the answers is a bit out of my league.
