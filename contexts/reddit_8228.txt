Does revealing the president's tax returns set a "dangerous precedent?" Why or why not?
Republican Representatives Kevin Brady and Mike Kelly said in a recent congress meeting that revealing the president's tax returns would set a "dangerous precedent."

What kind of “dangerous precedent” are Reps. Brady and Kelly referring to?

Did previous US presidents have to resist having their tax returns revealed like this?

Has there been any US presidents caught with dirt materials from their tax return and what harm has, if any, been done their presidency?
