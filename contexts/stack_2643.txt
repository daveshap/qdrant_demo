Reverse Engineering of Vector tiles and Tiles Security I am using the following workflow to generate and visualize vector tiles.Store edited shapefile to PostGISCreate vector tiles using Tippecanoe from PostGIS dataServe vector tiles through Tileserver-GLNow when I am inspecting the resultant map site I found the pbf files in Network section. It contains some hexadecimal values. I am using proprietary dataset. This dataset is confidential. I want to know is this secured method? If there is any way of reverse engineering the PBF files of vector tiles what is that and how can I protect my tiles or data security?
