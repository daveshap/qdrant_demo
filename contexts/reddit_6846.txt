As a temp working for the state until the Covid-19 layoffs. I may get my position back right away. Do you have to re-apply for your old job or will you just get hired back?
I'm researching the stock market and may decide to sell or buy shares depending on how fast the unemployment rate shrinks. The very positive jobs report that came out today suggests people might be able to go straight back to work soon. But I'm guessing. Any thoughts?
