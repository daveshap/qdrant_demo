I start my first job tomorrow (always in remote and full time). What are some good tips for starting this new job and my career?
I've only had experience doing internships.  What are some good tips for starting this new job and my career?

\- My new job is performance-based, so I have to achieve some quantitative goals. I think that at the beginning I will have many doubts to look up in a manual that they provide us and I will be very far from the work results of other workers. How to start to tackle my work well without feeling frustrated?

\- I may receive a video call and messages from my supervisor. How can I make a good impression?
