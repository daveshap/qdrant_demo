STARCK: Something's wrong with the bio-scan.
MILLER: Radiation interference?
STARCK: There's not enough radiation to throw off the scan. I'm picking up trace life forms, but I can't get a lock on the location.
WEIR: Could it be the crew? If they were in suspended animation, wouldn't that effect the scan?
STARCK: If they were in stasis, I'd get a location, but these readings, they're all over the ship. It doesn't make any sense.
MILLER: Okay. We do it the hard way. Deck by deck, room by room. Starck, deploy the umbilicus. I believe you're up for a walk, Mr. Justin. Go get your bonnet on.
JUSTIN: Yes, sir!
MILLER: Dr. Weir, I need you on the bridge.
WEIR: Captain, I didn't come out here to sit on your bridge, I need to be on that ship...
MILLER: Once the ship is secured, we'll bring you on board --
WEIR: That is not acceptable --
MILLER: -- once we've secured the ship, that's the way it is! I need you to guide us from the comm station. This is where I need you. Help us to do our job.
