ERIN: We'll work out the roller hockey thing, okay? Whatever you want, we'll work it out. I promise.
MATTHEW: You always say that. Then you go to work and forget you promised.
ERIN: I never forget, honey. I try, real hard. It's just, for some reason, I don't seem to be able to organize things right and -- when it comes to you guys, I end up falling short.
MATTHEW: You never fall short for the work people. I guess maybe you just love them more.
ERIN: Oh, God, sweetheart, no. There's nothing on Earth I love more than you. Nothing. I promise.
