Graduate Assistantship Interview Tips
Hi folks! I recently got admitted to Pitt’s Higher Education Management MEd program, and I’m so excited! I fell in love with higher education when I got to my undergrad institution, and knew it was the career path I wanted to follow ever since I became involved with my university’s office of admissions.

In order to get a chance at receiving a fully-funded GA position, I have two days of interviews at Pitt’s campus. I’m nervous because there’s a lot on the line for me- I’m a first generation college student who doesn’t want to take out more loans. There are only a few GA positions available (full tuition remission + $16K stipend and benefits), and they are quintessential for me to get since I’m an out of state student.

What advice do you have? I want to eventually get my PhD in higher ed doing research on first gen students, and I want that to come across in my interview. I’ve already reached out to a lot of the faculty at Pitt, including my dean, advisor, enrollment manager, and program director to introduce myself. What questions should I ask? What experiences should I highlight? 

TL;DR: Recently admitted Pitt MEd student who is a few weeks away from GA interviews. There aren’t a lot of GA positions available, and I need one to afford this program, so what will make me a viable candidate that stands out during their interview?
