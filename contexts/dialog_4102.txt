GEORGE: You wanna split?
BARBARA: Yeah, I don't feel so well.
GEORGE: Okay, guys, we're gonna leave. Let's get the check.
GEORGE: Are you sure you're okay? You're pale.
BARBARA: I feel like shit. Me and my frigging nosebleeds.
GEORGE: I'm taking you to the doctor when we get home, and I don't want to hear any arguments.
BARBARA: Would you be bummed out if I didn't go to Chicago with you?
GEORGE: No, not at all. Sure. You're right. You fly home and get some rest.
BARBARA: Nice first impression. A nose bleed in front of your parents.
GEORGE: Oh my G-d, how embarrassing were they? I wanted to shoot myself.
BARBARA: Oh, they weren't that bad. I mean, they were kind of cute.
GEORGE: Promise me that we'll never be like them. I don't want to wind up like that.
BARBARA: Relax, baby. We're going to wind up like us.
