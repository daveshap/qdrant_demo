What is the U.S.S. Defiant's backstory on Discovery? There are frequent mentions in the second half of the first season of Star Trek: Discovery of the U.S.S. Defiant<blockquote class=\"spoiler\">   which apparently was the first ship to cross from the Prime Universe to the Mirror Universe in this timeline.</blockquote>Am I supposed to know about this already?   What is the supposed backstory and in which episodes were these events depicted or described?
