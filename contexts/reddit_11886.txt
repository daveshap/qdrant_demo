I'm being sensitive.
Please bear with me, and allow me to give some background.

For the last 3 1/2 years, I've been an absolute hermit. I only speak to my husband, brother, and parents. I only leave the house to see my doctors or to get blood work done. Starting a few weeks ago, I was finally at a point where I thought I could engage the world.

Well, I forgot how inhospitable Reddit can be. I posted a video that actually happened (I witnessed it live on Twitch earlier in the week). Well, my brother and husband upvoted me for support (yay), but then I got downvoted and accused of submitting fake videos. It felt really good to be excited about sharing something with people outside of my family, but then that feeling turned sour as I realized I will probably never get acknowledgement of my existence from others (or of my input to others). It shouldn't matter, but it does. That thought hurts.

I know I'm overreacting, but after nearly 4 years of loneliness, I was ready for some positive human interaction.
