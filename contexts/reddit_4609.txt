My client that I work with every day told me something that really hit me in my feels and fucked me up
I work with a guy who has cerebral palsy, but it only affects his legs/feet, mentally he is fine and is pretty self sufficient— only needing help with a small amount of things.

Anyway, we were having some random discussions and he was like “you know why you don’t care about much or about how people treat you badly?”

And I’m like “what do you mean?”

And he said “you don’t care because you’re already broken”

I was like DAMN. How accurate. When I went home I had to cry a bit on that one.

I’m sure there’s multiple factors/reasons for it, but I’ve suffered with depression since a young age. I just didn’t know what it was for a long time.
