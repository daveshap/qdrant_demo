ARBOGAST: You came up here on a hunch, Miss Crane? Nothing more? No phone call... from him, or from your sister herself?
LILA: Not even a hunch. Just hope.
ARBOGAST: With a little checking, I could get to believe you.
LILA: I don't care if you do or... I want to see Mary... before she gets in any deeper...
SAM: Did you check in Phoenix... hospitals... maybe she had an accident... a hold-up...
ARBOGAST: She was seen leaving town in her car. Seen by her very victims, I might add.
SAM: I don't believe it. Do you?
LILA: Yes... I just... did. The moment they told me...
SAM: You might have doubted for say five minutes or so, Sister.
