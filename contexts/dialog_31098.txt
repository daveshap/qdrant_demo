BOBBY: The cobra's waitin' to strike, chica.
PERDITA: That guy Sailor came around this afternoon... Asked me if there was a contract out on 'im.
BOBBY: No shit?!?! You know him?
PERDITA: Used to.
BOBBY: What'd you say?
PERDITA: No, of course.
BOBBY: That's right... Could have a bad accident, though... before... durin'... or after a hold-up...
PERDITA: What's gonna happen when he sees me drivin' the car tomorrow?
BOBBY: Maybe he'll get a little nervous, but who gives a shit?
