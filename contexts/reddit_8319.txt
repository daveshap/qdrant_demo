Is there any evidence to back up the claim that creating higher tax brackets and raising income taxes on the rich would result in those people leaving the country, removing that revenue all together?
So with all the talk recently among the big names in the Democratic Party about [raising taxes on the rich](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/19/business/economy/wealth-tax-elizabeth-warren.html), and more specifically, expanding tax brackets beyond the current [~$600,000](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/taxes/federal-income-tax-brackets/) cap, concern has [again arisen among conservatives](https://www.foxbusiness.com/features/why-taxing-the-rich-doesnt-work) about the efficacy of this approach.

I came across an argument the other day that argued if income taxes were to be raised on these expanded brackets, then those individuals would just [leave the country](https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/will-high-taxes-force-the-rich-to-leave-america/) and/or move their assets to somewhere else, resulting in the elimination of the entirety of that tax revenue. 


I had never heard this argument before, and am very curious about its validity and where it does or doesn't hold true.
