I skipped work today due to my anxiety and now I'm so disappointed with myself. Anyone else ever done the same thing?
My job makes me pretty depressed.

My boss has been away for over a month and I was basically left to my own devices, which was great. He returned today.

Yesterday and last night, I was so worried that I would get depressed that it turned into anxiety. Then I began worrying that I hadn't done enough while he was away that it created even more anxiety. 

I woke up drenched in a cold sweat this morning and called in sick. Now I'm anxious that they'll be pissed off that I wasn't at work yesterday. 

It's a vicious circle and I'm ashamed of myself for running away from my problems.

Anyone else ever done something similar?
