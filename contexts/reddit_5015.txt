People acting like they feel bad for me is making my depression worse.
So about 6 months ago something happened that sent me into the worst depression of my life. I already get depression sometimes, but up until a few months or less ago I was ready to kill myself.

I ended up moving back in with my parents (did not want to, I didn’t grow up in a healthy household and it’s still not healthy) and quitting my job (about 4 months ago).

I’m currently picking myself back up. I’m at the point that I know when I get a new job I will for the most part be back to normal. 

Whenever I talk to my mom about putting out applications and what I’m doing, she just gives me this sad looking smile. 

I know that my mom/parents are not healthy...honestly I need to move out of here when I can (there are a lot of reasons that I won’t go into right now). 

But I guess in my state of mind this really bothers me. I’m trying to get back on my feet and instead of someone there to say “you can do this!” I get this pity look. I don’t understand. It makes me go back into that thinking pattern of “what’s the point?”.

I don’t need praise in normal life, but with what I’ve been through/am going through it would be nice to have some positive support.

I don’t really have anyone else besides my parents right now and one friend that I see occasionally. (Another thing I plan to start working on, making more friends). 

Any advice or suggestions on how to deal with this within myself? (I’m not interested in trying to change someone else).
