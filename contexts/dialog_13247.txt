ANNA: You got it. Operation Deflower Mayflower is a bad joke and I'm the punchline. I thought we were using the CIA to help us to get Mayflower, but really the CIA was using me to keep us away from Mayflower.
CARDINAL: Oh, why couldn't I be the Cardinal in charge of catering.... If the Mayflowers get the three sections of Da Vinci's crystal and his instructions for the gold machine-- Aie-yi--Do we got anything? What of Alex, Hawk's friend, where is his loyalty?
ANNA: I'm going to find out.
CARDINAL: I'm sorry for losing it back there, but you must remember, sister, you have vows to God as well as a mission to the world.
ANNA: I know, I know, your Eminence, just say God go with me.""
CARDINAL: God go with you, sister.
