Bankruptcy and the SA job search
Hi. I have a question for all you more experienced SA pro's. I have been applying for a fair amount of jobs and I have a housing search committee  contacting my references this week. I just filed for bankruptcy in July (medical bills and the time sick and out work were expensive and long) and I am so scared that this will limit me fiding a job anytime soon.  

How bad will this mark on my background check affect things. Any advice on what I can do?
