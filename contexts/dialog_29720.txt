HELEN: Tell me what happened?
SIMON: I'm sorry, I can't.
HELEN: You can trust me completely.
SIMON: I know. But it would compromise your safety too much to know certain things.
HELEN: Right, of course. I was worried when I didn't hear from you that night.
SIMON: It's strange. I knew I was in a woman's thoughts when I was shooting it out with those assassins.
