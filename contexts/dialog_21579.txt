SAM: Sorry.
LILA: Hospital clean.
SAM: What?
LILA: The bathroom. Look at how clean it is. The one in our cabin is clean... but this is clean!
SAM: What is it?
LILA: It didn't get washed down. It's figuring... the kind you tear up and get rid of. Some figure has been added to or subtracted from... forty thousand.
LILA: That's proof Mary was here! It would be too wild a coincidence for somebody else to...
SAM: Bates never denied Mary was here.
LILA: Yes. But maybe this proves that Bates found out about the money.
SAM: Do we simply ask him where he's hidden it?
LILA: Sam, that old woman, whoever she is. I think she told Arbogast something! And I want her to tell us the same thing!
SAM: You can't go up there.
LILA: Why not?
SAM: Bates.
