MYRA: He didn't think they were risks. He was so good, Roy, he could just play with the mark.
ROY: And when he got serious?
MYRA: He'd explain he had to have cash, so there wouldn't be any paper trail for the SEC. And a lot of cash, or it wasn't worth while. The least we ever took was forty thousand, and the most was one hundred eighty-five thousand dollars! From one sucker!
ROY: I thought these people were broke.
MYRA: No, no, Roy, just cash poor. They had savings accounts, stocks to sell, houses to mortgage. Sell their wife's jewelry. Oh, they had a lot of money, when they put their minds to it. Or when I put their minds to it. I stayed with them, that's the roper's job, made them get up every penny they could raise, turn it all over to Cole.
ROY: And a month later, the sucker calls the cops and you're on the run.
MYRA: No no! He never calls the cops, not after we give him the blow-off.
ROY: Yeah? How?
