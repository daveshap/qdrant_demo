I have never had affection in my life, respect or trust, and I was abused and gaslit by my whole family for over 20 years. Suddenly, my brain is convinced that suicide is a realistic option?
Some backstory is needed here.

I'm a girl, in my 20s, who never had friends, and never had affection/basic respect from the whole family and people OR a normal life. Taken for granted and bullied in school.

I was physically and mentally abused mainly by my mom who doesn't like my gender.

Nearly killed by her and from the day I started noticing the gaslighting I also realised my family is made up of abusers or enablers, with people justifying my mother's insaneness even when it happened in front of them...

...telling me it was my fault and "you are the one who drove her to kill you. You made her miserable".

Literally the only people I can speak to is my psychologist and web friends, either because I am 100% alone and because I can't even start talking. The only times I hear my voice is during a fight with other narcs of the family.

My only way out is a job. My short term memory is mostly gone so I can't study (I tried, failed, had to leave uni) and I have no hobbies since my mind has no space for anything that isn't survival.

So here I am: familyless, friendless, without an identity, without something that makes me laugh or enjoy life, without a future that I look forward to.

In all of this, my mind is suddenly considering suicide as an OBJECTIVE solution, as the only one. I am scared of this unconsciius thought, if your situation was like mine and you got out of it, I'm listening.

Thank you in advance.



P.S. I see many of you contacted me privately, but that's a lot of you, so don't be upset if I can't answer: I appreciate.
