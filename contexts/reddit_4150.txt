There should be a reverse tinder
Practically everyone knows that Tinder is real shit for your self-image, right? Since people are judging you on your looks rather than you? 
All I'm saying is that there should be a tinder-like app where it shows like 5 bullet points about the person, and you swipe left or right based on that. If you swipe right, then you get to see pictures of the person and talk to them.
(Yes, I am a hater of Tinder due to lack of success and my disgusting schlubby body)

Is that already a thing?
