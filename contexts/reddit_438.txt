I need help with this girl I’m persuing.
Hi, I am in 10th grade and I need help with someone I’m pursuing, she is the cutest, funniest, smartest, and nicest girl I know. Thing is, I haven’t talked to her in a while when we used to talk a lot all the time. I feel it would just be super suspicious/obvious if I just email/talk to her out of nowhere. We have no classes together this semester but we might have a chance next semester which is happening soon. Any advice on how to approach this and get the friendship back up again is appreciated.
