Stable job I like ($50k) or risky job I love ($70k)?
Stable job I **like** ($50k) or risky job I **love** ($72k)?

First, I’m 40.

I’m currently at a **stable job** (technically no job is stable I know), in a position I’m comfortable in, with a boss that likes me and would fight for me (and says he has plans for me with the company), in a company that has been around for 20 years, with decent benefits & flexibility (periodic paid lunches, somewhat flexible schedule, etc), I literally have 0 complaints about this job. Job is even easy too, I don’t see myself ever getting fired and could be there for years to come (won’t love it, but won’t hate it, it's nice, I like it)... It’s stable.

But there’s another **risky job** that pays more ($72k vs $50k) in an industry I’m super passionate about… but there’s risk because it’s a startup company, in an industry where others didn't make it, so it may not be around in 3-5 years.

It’s typically easy for me to make hard decisions, but this one has just got me torn. Everything is pointing to taking the high paying job doing something I love, but the uncertainty of the future is making me 2nd guess myself. And I would hate to burn a bridge with my current employee.

Any advice here? And if it helps, here’s some background about me:

**ASL**: 40/m/Idaho  
**Debt**: $70k left in mortgage, $7k left on car, $7k left in Credit Cards  
**Kids**: No  
**Married**: Yes, she doesn’t work  
**Priorities**: My credit is 500\~ and I desperately need to get it improved asap by paying off my Credit Cards (reasons I won’t bore you with)

Anyway, the wonderful world of Reddit, my first post ever. Professional thoughts on my situation?
