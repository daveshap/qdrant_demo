What kind of things can I do to calm down about my first post-college job?
Just starting my first job; overwhelmed and nervous about everything

I just started my first job after college and almost everything is getting to me. It’s like I’m having an existential crisis. The biggest problem is that there is no definitive end like there was in school. It’s a totally different scenario than school and I am not used to it yet. I am also going through a health issue and that adds stress. My job pays well and has good benefits and I am thankful for that. I also know I’m not stuck here forever and I am using this as experience and a learning moment.

Any tips for me to feel more comfortable?
