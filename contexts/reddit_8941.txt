In light of the election in Pakistan, what are some different ways states have addressed a powerful military that often intervenes politically?
Amidst high levels of violence, directed at both politicians and civilians, Pakistan [held an election](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/07/pakistan-elections-2018-latest-updates-180724055555410.html) that seems to indicate Imran Khan's PTI has won, albeit not a majority. This opens the possibility of a civilian-to-civilian transfer of power, which has been infrequent in Pakistani history.

There exist opinions that this victory was influenced by the decisions of Pakistan's powerful military. Shamila Chaudhary, who was an official under the Obama administration and now is an adviser at Johns Hopkins, [describes](https://www.npr.org/2018/07/27/632673383/opinion-imran-khan-has-declared-victory-in-pakistans-election-but-the-military-w?t=1532734461945): 

>But the legitimacy of Khan's government will undoubtedly be questioned for the duration of his tenure. Ironically, in shaping the political environment to favor Khan, the establishment has effectively handicapped its own candidate.

>With Sharif's party sidelined and Khan having to defend his legitimacy, the establishment has taken a page out of a playbook from the 1990s, when the military would pit politicians against each other to ensure weak coalition governments wouldn't unify against military influence. This era ended in 1999, when Musharraf ousted Sharif in a military coup.

>The return to 1990s-style party politics has ushered in a backsliding of Pakistan's democratic culture, which begs the question: Could it also eventually lead to another coup? The makings of it are already underway, with Pakistan's politicized judiciary, compromised media, an exhausted and untrusting electorate, and a fractured political elite.

Pakistan is one of numerous states that have experienced cycles of civilian rule and military coups. Turkey [has had several](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2016/07/15/turkey-military-coup-history/87153106/), including a failed one in 2016. [One study found 475 attempted coups](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/07/22/map-the-world-of-coups-since-1950/?utm_term=.9cb00a51d2b6) worldwide since 1950, with about half succeeding- though not all coups are conducted by the military.

**How have states dealt differently with this instability and the balance between military and civilian power?** Some states have had decades since their last coup, others have had them in the last few years. There is a process whereby militaries can have expanded or limited powers, with varying levels of success. An example is in Indonesia, where the military has historically had its own business holdings that provided revenue independent of the national budget. The [process of civilian regulation is complicated and incomplete](http://jakartaglobe.id/archive/whats-the-indonesian-militarys-business/).
