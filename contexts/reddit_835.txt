If you're reading this it means I did it
I'm really socially anxious and thinking about posting this is making it hard to breath and making me shake but I'm trying to get better and if you're reading this then it means I am taking a small step towards my goal and this is my first post so I'm even more anxious. I'm trying so hard from crying and deleting this post. I've probably wrote 50 different sentences and deleted them thinking it's not good enough and that people would be upset. I really don't want to but I got to try. It's been 15-20 minuets since I started to type all of this  and I'm really  scared on posting it. Please don't be too hard on me... I'm sorry for  the mess of the post  but if you're reading this it means I did it and thank you for reading.
