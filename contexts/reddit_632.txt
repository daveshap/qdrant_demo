My parents are threatening me with my university application
I (17F) recently got accepted to my dream program. My parents were originally happy for me, but they’re now threatening me with it.
I have chronic depression. While I’m high-functioning, it can be really difficult for me to find motivation. My parents know this. I’m medicated.
I do not have a job. I have sent out numerous applications, even gone out once or twice with a bunch of copies of my resumes, handing them out to every retail store available. When I did this, the stores either told me that they only hire online, or they’re not hiring at the second and will give it to the manager/keep the resume on file.
My parents don’t believe I’ve even applied. That, or they think I’m too lazy to reapply at every given time.
Anyway.
They’ve recently started telling me they’re going to call the university if I don’t get hired by a certain time. I have savings to fall back on, and OSAP (I’m Canadian), and yet they’re insistent that I don’t have anything, no ambition, and don’t deserve university. They’re genuinely going to call the freaking university and reject the offer of my dream school!
I don’t know what to do. Are they even allowed to do that? As a minor, can I stop them?
TL;DR My parents are threatening to call the university and reject my dream program’s offer if I don’t get hired. Can they do that?
