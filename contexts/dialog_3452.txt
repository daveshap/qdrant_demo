EDWARD: That poet, Norther Winslow did. He was going to Paris, France. He must have liked it, because no one ever heard from him again. Tell you what. You take the other way and I'll cut through here. Meet you on the far side.
KARL: You're not trying to run away?
EDWARD: Just to be sure, you can take my pack.
