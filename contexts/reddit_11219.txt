Tomorrow (Jan 1) is my birthday, and I hate it
I can't even tell you exactly why. Maybe it's because my birthday parties always revolved around a New Years Eve party. Maybe because my family can't be assed to just call and say Happy Birthday. Maybe because when I say I want to do nothing for my birthday, that isn't good enough. I truly don't know. But here I am, a 33 (tomorrow) father of 3, sitting in the bathroom crying over it being my birthday.

This is such a dumb thing.
