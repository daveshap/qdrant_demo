SALLY: A little.
BRETT: Sorry.
SALLY: Thanks.
BRETT: Anything I can do? I'd jump overboard if it'd help you.
SALLY: Mighty decent of you, pal.
BRETT: Decent? I guess any guy could be decent--if you were interested.
SALLY: What are you thinking?
BRETT: A lot of things I'd like to forget.
SALLY: That's funny--so was I. Guess the ocean makes one sentimental
BRETT: I can't blame the ocean--it's you.
SALLY: You don't know anything about me. If you did, you probably wouldn't be here.
