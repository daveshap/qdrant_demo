I can't open up to anyone
I just don't have anyone to open up to. I've never been close to my sister, and my dad hates me. the only person in my close family I could talk to is my mum, and I don't want to tell her just how bad I feel all the time, because she gets really stressed about everything, and I don't wanna hurt her. I'm not nearly close enough to any of my friends to talk to them about how i feel. I keep posting online, reaching out because i need to feel like somebody cares. and as supportive as everyone has been every single time, I need a shoulder to cry on. I need a hug more than anything in the world, and I can't have it.  


Edit: wow, I got to the top of the sub! I've gotten a lot of replies, so I'm really sorry if I don't get to everybody! thank you all for being so supportive!
