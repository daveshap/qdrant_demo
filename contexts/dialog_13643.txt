CHATTAR LAL: Captain Blumburtt and his troops are here to check up on the natives"."
CAPT. BLUMBURTT: Just a routine inspection tour.
CHATTAR LAL: The British worry so about their Empire -- it makes us feel like well- cared-for children.
WILLIE: Listen, Mr. Lal, what do you call the Maharajah's wife?
CHATTAR LAL: His Highness has not yet taken a wife.
WILLIE: No? Well, I guess he just hasn't met the right woman...
CAPT. BLUMBURTT: Interested in local curios?
INDIANA: No. But I am interested in the occult. And this is a kryta.
CAPT. BLUMBURTT: Charming.
INDIANA: It's like the voodoo dolls of West Africa. The kryta represents your enemy -- and gives you complete power over him.
CAPT. BLUMBURTT: Thank God all that mumbo jumbo rubbish is disappearing.
INDIANA: You think so?
CAPT. BLUMBURTT: Of course. Admittedly, it's taken time. Britain's controlled India for almost two hundred years now.
INDIANA: You're hanging on better here than you did in America.
CAPT. BLUMBURTT: This is a different situation, Dr. Jones. These people are like children. We have to lead them slowly into the twentieth century.
INDIANA: The Prime Minister doesn't seem that naive.
CAPT. BLUMBURTT: No, he's a very shrewd old boy. Power behind the throne and all that. He actually runs this whole province.
