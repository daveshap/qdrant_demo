KIRKEBY: Hi, Baxter.
BUD: What do you want?
KIRKEBY: What do I -- ? Just a minute.
BUD: You can't come in.
KIRKEBY: What's the matter with you, Buddy- boy? I made a reservation for four o'clock, remember?
BUD: Look, you can't stay here. Just take your champagne and go.
KIRKEBY: Baxter, I don't want to pull rank on you -- but I told the lady it was all set -- you want to make a liar out of me?
BUD: Are you going to leave, Mr. Kirkeby, or do I have to throw you out?
KIRKEBY: Buddy-boy, why didn't you say so? You got yourself a little playmate, huh?
BUD: Now will you get out?
