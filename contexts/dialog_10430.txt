WASHINGTON: My God... They mean to finish us. What about Arnold? He's up there.
JOSEPH REED: What can he do? The British have massive superiority.
NATHANAEL GREENE: I doubt Arnold will be afraid.
JOSEPH REED: If he isn't, then he's stupid.
JOSEPH REED: Did God ever make such a pitiful army?
NATHANAEL GREENE: These men have suffered but I believe they will fight.
JOSEPH REED: No officer is going to get these men to fight! They had the life crushed out of them on Long Island. At the most, perhaps we could make a feint at an outpost, then retire to protect Congress.
NATHANAEL GREENE: I hear General Lee is holding seven thousand fresh infantry back in New York -- why won't he come on!?
JOSEPH REED: General Lee is detained captain...
NATHANAEL GREENE: Detained by what?
JOSEPH REED: The British army, sir!
NATHANAEL GREENE: The British Army is right back there, across that river! Sir! I think it must be something else that detains General Lee.
