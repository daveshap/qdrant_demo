JERRY: Yah, real good. How you doin'?
VOICE: Pretty good, Mr. Lundegaard. You're damned hard to get on the phone.
JERRY: Yah, it's pretty darned busy here, but that's the way we like it.
VOICE: That's for sure. Now, I just need, on these last, these financing documents you sent us, I can't read the serial numbers of the vehicles on here, so I -
JERRY: But I already got the, it's okay, the loans are in place, I already got the, the what, the -
VOICE: Yeah, the three hundred and twenty thousand dollars, you got the money last month.
JERRY: Yah, so we're all set.
VOICE: Yeah, but the vehicles you were borrowing on, I just can't read the serial numbers on your application. Maybe if you could just read them to me -
JERRY: But the deal's already done, I already got the money -
VOICE: Yeah, but we have an audit here, I just have to know that these vehicles you're financing with this money, that they really exist.
JERRY: Yah, well, they exist all right.
VOICE: I'm sure they do - ha ha! But I can't read their serial numbers here. So if you could read me -
JERRY: Well, but see, I don't have 'em in front a me - why don't I just fax you over a copy -
VOICE: No, fax is no good, that's what I have and I can't read the darn thing -
JERRY: Yah, okay, I'll have my girl send you over a copy, then.
VOICE: Okay, because if I can't correlate this note with the specific vehicles, then I gotta call back that money -
JERRY: Yah, how much money was that?
VOICE: Three hundred and twenty thousand dollars. See, I gotta correlate that money with the cars it's being lent on.
JERRY: Yah, no problem, I'll just fax that over to ya, then.
VOICE: No, no, fax is -
JERRY: I mean send it over. I'll shoot it right over to ya.
VOICE: Okay.
JERRY: Okay, real good, then.
