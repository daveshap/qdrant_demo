Question about modem (analog/digital) As I have understood the concept of modems, modems translate digital signal to analog ones and in reverse.Well and then I've read the definition of a modem (technical book):<blockquote>  A modem converts digital direct current signals to digital alternating current signals and the other way around.</blockquote>Well how does the word \"analog\" fit in there!? How can I get a picture of it? Can you explain a bit how \"direct current\" and \"alternating current\" fits in there?
