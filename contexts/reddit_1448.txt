Does anyone else's anxiety mean they can't ever enjoy/do anything on sunday because of work the next day?
Like, i can't even leave the house or do anything outside of the house the day before I have to work because my anxiety tells me there is no point. It is hard to explain..but I just feel I can't do anything the day before work because I will be too stressed and anxious about work the next day and if I went out of the house to do anything, I would be constantly looking at my watch to see how long is left until I have to work (18 hours, 12 hours etc.) and feel sick with anxiety.

By staying in I can try and maintain a routine that helps me, but it is becoming harder as now it is creeping into my saturdays and I am beginning to not want to go out on Saturdays now either. It is so hard to explain why I do this, I am not even sure. People are starting to notice. Does anyone else experience this and have found any ways to manage this?
