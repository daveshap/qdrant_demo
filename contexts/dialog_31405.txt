GRADY: Well, there's always people you don't know at these things, but I can't say there was anybody particularly suspicious... Wait. There was one guy. Tiny fella. Claimed to be a jockey.
OFFICER PUPCIK: A jockey? You mean, like --
GRADY: Horses, right. Vernon something... Hardapple.
OFFICER PUPCIK: Hardapple?
GRADY: I could be wrong. What happened anyway?
OFFICER PUPCIK: Huh? Oh, someone pulled a B&E on Dr. Gaskell's closet. And the dog's missing.
GRADY: That's weird.
OFFICER PUPCIK: We figure the perpetrator let him out. He's blind and we figure he just wandered off and got run over.
GRADY: The perpetrator.
OFFICER PUPCIK: No, the dog.
GRADY: Just kidding.
OFFICER PUPCIK: One other thing. About this kid, this student of yours -- Leer -- James Leer. You wouldn't know how I could get in touch with him, would you?
GRADY: I might have his number on campus.
OFFICER PUPCIK: That's all right. We'll find him.
