A word for 'treated-out' or 'therapied-out' - all medical treatment exhausted without effect I'm looking for a word that describes the following:A patient who has received all possible medical treatment but all of them have failed to initiate a cure or remission. The patient cannot be (meaningfully) helped according to traditional medicine. The patient's illness does not necessarily have to be a terminal disease.  Hence: The patient is 'treated-out' or 'therapied-out'. I'm aware that 'treated-out' and 'therapied-out' do not exist. And currently I don't intend to use them.  The word or two-worded term I'm looking for could be the counterpart to the German word 'austherapiert'.NOTE: I'm NOT looking for untreatable patient, terminal-stage patient, palliative care, palliative treatment, or palliative care patient    I am looking for a word or two-worded term that relates to the patient and implies that essentially all conceivable treatment has been tried and applied, unsuccessfully.  (UPDATE)     THE MOST APPROPRIATE TERMS FOUNDThe following expressions seem to match best with what I was looking for:all treatment options exhausteda treatment-exhausted patient'therapied out' - seems to be an uncommon but more and more frequently used term, according to the search results on Google Books but much less in scientific literature; bear in mind Google's Ngram Viewer has no entries for 'therapied out' (Ngram Viewer version 2012/2013, as available on 22 Nov 2018)
