ANYA: Don't look so uncomfortable, Lee--it interferes with your good looks. Give me a cigarette. What did you do--persuade her to come on this voyage with you?
LOTHER: Don't talk such bunk! She's one of the acts on the ship. I just ran into her by accident.
ANYA: Did you muss up her hair by accident, too?
LOTHER: You mind your own business! She's an old friend of mine and I like her--what're you going to do about it?
ANYA: Just make it as difficult as possible for you to see her.
LOTHER: I didn't ask you to come away with me--
ANYA: Oh--a hundred times--
LOTHER: --and I can tell you where to get off.
ANYA: And when you do I'll convey your respects by wireless to Herbert. Take it easy, Lee--no other woman'll ever get you. At least I'm honest when I tell you there must be something pretty low down in me--because I like you. You're such a swine!
LOTHER: Will you leave me alone?
ANYA: I like touching you--poison ivy. You'd just been kissing that girl when I came in, hadn't you?
LOTHER: Baloney!
ANYA: No, darling, lip rouge--all over your mouth.
