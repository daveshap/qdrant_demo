CHRISTY: What? What time is it?
MARY ROBERT: It's after five. We have to bathe.
CHRISTY: Five a.m.?
MARY PATRICK: Isn't it a glorious morning? Good morning, Mary Clarence. sleep well?
CHRISTY: Right.
MARY ROBERT: Is this like your old convent?
MARY PATRICK: Which convent was that, Sister?
CHRISTY: Which convent? It was, um, the Little Sisters... of the Moonlight. In Vegas. Everybody used to come to Mass. Frank. Dean. Sammy. Right at ringside.
MARY LAZARUS: Enough jabber.
CHRISTY: What?
MARY LAZARUS: Progressive convents. Vanity. It sounds awful. It sounds just like this place.
CHRISTY: Like this place?
MARY LAZARUS: I like my old convent, in Vancouver. Out in the woods. It wasn't all modern, like here. No electricity. Cold water. Bare feet. Those were nuns. It was Hell on earth, but I loved it. This place is a Hilton.
