KEITH: Sounds good.
LENNY: I can get you what you want. You just have to talk to me. I'm your priest, your shrink, your main connection to the switchboard of souls. I'm the Magic Man, the Santa Claus of the Subconscious. You say it, you even think it, you can have it. You want a girl, you want two girls? I don't know what your thing is or what you're curious about... you want a guy? You want to be a girl... see what that feels like? You want a nun to tie you up? It's all doable.
KEITH: Talk to me about costs, here.
LENNY: Listen, before we get into numbers, I want you to try a taste. I got a deck with me.
KEITH: What? Right Here?
LENNY: Step into my office.
