I am such a hypocrite.
Telling Brown I love the flexibility and freedom of the Open Curriculum and how it will help me design my own path with my majors, focusing on what I like and want to explore.

Then telling Columbia I love their Core Curriculum and how it will give me a new perspective on learning..how it will keep me grounded, allowing me to learn the foundations of humanities etc. along with my major.
