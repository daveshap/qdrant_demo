A Question about LinkedIn
Hi Reddit,

I apologize for my non descriptive title, but it's a rather silly question, that I don't know how to phrase properly. Basically, I want to use LinkedIn, but I don't like the fact that anyone can look me up (I've had a landlord that I was in the middle of a legal dispute with, along with an individual who I do not want to know my whereabouts). However, not having anyone be able to access my LinkedIn seems to defeat the purpose of having a LinkedIn (making myself available for any job opportunities).

Is there any way around this, or is it basically a "Choose One" situation?
