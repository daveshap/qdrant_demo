LINDA: Because you were spoiled, don't try to spoil Sunny.
BABE BROTHER: My daddy never gave me anything without my having to sweat for it. Every summer, the way they kept me and Junior out of trouble was to send us to Big Daddy's farm. We would get up with the chickens. Every summer the fence had to be repaired. The barn needed a coat of paint. We had to pip all of Big Mama's hundred laying hens and go to church all day on Sunday. For Big Daddy, calluses and sweat were the mark of a man. Sunny will never have to bust his knuckles like we did.
LINDA: I want Sunny to have an advantage that you and I never had, but he needs discipline, and you are not helping when I tell him to do something and you allow him to get out of it.
BABE BROTHER: What is a sip of coffee going to do?
LINDA: Coffee is bad for anybody, especially for a child.
BABE BROTHER: I don't see you crying about my drinking it.
LINDA: How old are you?
