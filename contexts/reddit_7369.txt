How I broke out of retail & got a 6 figure salary in 3 years
This is a personal story.  Some details have changed or kept vague to protect my identity since I work for a "high profile" position now.

First, my humblebrag: I make over $100k per year working about 20-25 hours per week for a multinational corporation in the Midwest US.  I'm officially a "business analyst."  In reality, I look at Outlook and Excel for 10 hours per week and B.S. the rest.

Three years ago, I worked 40 hours a week on my feet doing retail customer service B.S. at a local grocery chain.  I made $10 per hour.  I have a liberal arts degree.

Here's what helped me make the transition (in order of importance).

**1\. Learn new skills on my own time**.  When I decided that I had enough of retail, I went to the library and picked up books on different office skills.  Excel, accounting, finance, project management, basic programming, and business leadership.  For me, these were the topics that stuck.  I came home every damn night and read and practiced everything.  I continued to do this even after my first office job.

**2\. Be a job hopper**.  I found job hopping opened many more opportunities.  Yes, some people will thumb their nose at your resume, but it's necessary to advance.  I've had 5 jobs in the past 3 years (not counting the retail one).  Contract positions were great because it taught a lot.

**3\. Keep in contact with old coworkers (aka networking)**. This didn't help me get my first job, but it did help me land my current gig.

**4\. Find the path of least resistance.**  Opportunities just came up organically that I was not interested in.  I would normally not be interested in programming, but a software development position came up in my company and my boss asked me if I was interested.  No, I wasn't, but I studied my ass off and took it anyway since it was a move up.  I'm not a developer now, but I have used a lot of those skills in my current job to get some street cred with the IT/tech department.

**5\. Be willing to stay late for a big project.**  My father gave me advice once that said: be the first one in the office and the last one to leave.  This advice is old hat.  Here's my version.  Stay late for a big project ONCE, then come in late and leave early afterwards.  Once you get the reputation of the one who got that big project done, you never have to worry about being on time to work again.  You get a lot of cred with leadership who don't give a crap about what time you came in today.

**6\. Keep a good relationship with a GOOD third-party recruiter.**  Third party recruiters are a dime a dozen.  And there are some shady ones out there.  But if you find a good one, they are really valuable.  Found 2 jobs through one.

Here's been my career path:

First job: admin assistant (aka secretary) for around $25k/yr

Second job: financial analyst - looked at spreadsheets for around $40k/yr

Third job: junior software developer - built some stupid internal websites around $50k/yr (only job where I moved within the same company)

Fourth job: project manager - a much better paying admin assistant around $80k/yr

Fifth job: business analyst for around $110k/yr
