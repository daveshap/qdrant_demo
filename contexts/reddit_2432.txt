"We've decided not to fill this position at this time." Has anyone been getting these emails more frequently given the whole coronavirus situation?
Today I got an email from a position I applied for and as soon as I saw it I thought "Of course, ANOTHER rejection where they tell me I'm not a good fit." I was shocked when that wasn't the case. Instead I was greeted with an email stating that the hiring manager decided not to fill the position at this time.

I'm wondering if given the whole situation with the coronavirus that this is happening more often. I know it's possible I could have gotten this even if it weren't happening right now, but I know tons of places are struggling and are currently experiencing hiring freezes. Has anyone else been getting these type of emails recently?
