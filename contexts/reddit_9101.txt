Hi, I'm a reporter. Let me know if you face eviction this month due to coronavirus pay issues.
Hi guys,

I've posted in here before, but my name is Emma. I'm a reporter for VICE News covering poverty and civil rights. I'm watching all sorts of bill payments, but I understand a lot of folks are really worried about eviction amid COVID-19 because how sudden the consequences are in many states. A lot of civil rights advocates right now are fighting for both suspended mortgage and rent payments, considering how many folks could lose pay (and their homes) during this outbreak and all its resulting economic turmoil. I know we're not at the first of the month, but if this applies to you and you're worried, reach out. You can PM, post here, or email [emma.ockerman@vice.com](mailto:emma.ockerman@vice.com) and I'll get in touch.
