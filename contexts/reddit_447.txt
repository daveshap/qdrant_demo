Female advice pls read!
So there’s this girl we messed around one time just kissing it prob would have gone farther but I had a fast food meal before and just as the alcohol hit my stomach I felt like I was going to puke. So in the end I went home and puked my brains out.

It’s been a good while we chilled a couple months after this but it wasn’t intimate.  

She and I both want to chill again and get drunk. I’m not sure if she wants to do anything. If nothing is mentioned how can I bring it up or make a move without sounding like a dumbass.

Thanks for any help!
