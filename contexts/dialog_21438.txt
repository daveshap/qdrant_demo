EDWARD: Stop. For just a moment. Mr. Kross, I'd like to ask you a few questions <u>before</u> you sign. You realize that you're a target. If you weren't mine, you'd be someone elses, correct?
KROSS: Yes.
EDWARD: If you had a... reprieve, what would do?
STUCKEY: I don't think there's any sense in --
EDWARD: Let him answer.
KROSS: I... I would take advantage of it.
EDWARD: How?
KROSS: I... I don't know. There... there wasn't time...
EDWARD: I suppose you'd find out soon enough that you have assets you presently don't seem aware of, wouldn't you? The waste processing licenses at that abandoned shipyard of yours, you'd certainly find out about that.
STUCKEY: Oh, my god... Edward, no!
EDWARD: I suppose you'd use them as collateral on new loans, wouldn't you?
STUCKEY: Have you lost your mind?
KROSS: Quiet. Would I get the loans?
EDWARD: This time I imagine you would, yes. Hmm... With all this in mind, Mr. Kross, I can't logically make a formal bid on your company, can I?
KROSS: You'd be initiating a financial battle you'd ultimately lose, Mr. Harris.
EDWARD: You're very right. I think the best thing we could all do is go home.
STUCKEY: What!?
EDWARD: Have a good day, gentlemen.
