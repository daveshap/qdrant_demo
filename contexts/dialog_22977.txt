CINDY: Oh, my God. It happened right here. She came home. She saw them.
PROFESSOR: Saw who?!
CINDY: Don't touch me!!
DWIGHT: What the hell?!
PROFESSOR: It's not what is looks like. She's having a breakdown. Help me get her to her room.
DWIGHT: Professor, we need to talk.
PROFESSOR: What is it, Dwight?
DWIGHT: I think we should consider cutting the experiment short.
PROFESSOR: What?
DWIGHT: The force in this house is far greater than I anticipated. In one night I recorded cold spots, shifting magnetic fields, the E.U.P. is picking up white sounds everywhere.
PROFESSOR: That's why we came here, remember?
DWIGHT: Yes, but I've seen the tapes. This poltergeist is becoming increasingly more violent. We all could be in danger. I say we pull the plug.
PROFESSOR: Whoa, Dwight, I say when we pull the plug. Get a hold of yourself. Dwight, we're on the verge of greatness and I'm about this close to getting laid. Now, the bus will be here on Monday. Until then no one leaves.
