VINCENT: That makes twice now you've saved my life.
SAM: I didn't save your life back there. Risked it, maybe -- but I didn't save shit.
VINCENT: You see it your way, I'll see it mine. You need a doctor.
SAM: You know one around here? Somebody you trust?
VINCENT: No...I thought I'd take you to the hospital.
SAM: No hospitals. I'll fix this myself if I have to.
VINCENT: Fix it yourself? Why are we even doing this? There's no need to run, Christ... You're a cop.
SAM: Not exactly.
VINCENT: You're with Interpol -- you're a cop.
SAM: If I was a cop, a real cop, I'd have busted you a long time ago. This isn't about you, it's about the job I have to do.
VINCENT: And what job is that?
SAM: My job, Vincent, a job you don't need to know about. I can't go to the local cops -- they'd never be able to get close enough at this point. It's me or nobody, and I've been on this job too goddamned long not to finish.
VINCENT: It looks to me like we're all that's left of our group.
SAM: We? There is no we in my world now, Vincent, just me.
VINCENT: I'm going with you.
SAM: This doesn't involve you, don't you understand? I can't even guarantee you any money out of all this.
VINCENT: It isn't about money for me, not anymore.
SAM: You don't have to do this.
VINCENT: Yes I do.
DEIRDRE: When we're done with this, I want to do for that one myself.
SEAMUS: Now there's the Deirdre I know.
DEIRDRE: And what's that supposed to mean, Seamus Reilly?
SEAMUS: It means I was worried that all the time you spent away from the fold might have affected you. You've been living the life of the hired gun -- the well paid hired gun, I might note. There's no glory to it, but there are those that like it.
DEIRDRE: So you thought that maybe I'd grown too attached to this charade I've been playing, is that it?
SEAMUS: It's been known to happen.
DEIRDRE: Not to me, you know that.
SEAMUS: I thought I did.
