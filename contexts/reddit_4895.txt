The day I got a zero.
I am having my semester exchange now in Korea and received my quiz results that I took 3 weeks ago. I got a flat zero. Not even a chance was given to me.

I knew I was fucked when I was doing the paper because none of the things I studied came out. I studied wronly by just trying to remember the theory but I didn't find the practise questions to practise.

Turned out I couldn't do a single question out of the 3 questions. I tried to write whatever I know hoping to get some makes but not a single chance was given. Flat zero.

I am a hard worker because I am not smart. Things like this really makes me feel like giving up at times. I know I should have studied smarter. It was really a messed up part on my revision.

I am having my midterms next week and i know its a chance for me to make it right again. But I am so tired. I have a total of 7 exams to take within 3 days.

At this point of time I'm just sad and tired. But I still have to study. That's my life right.
