My husband found an app that was designed to help fight depression...
It's called SuperBetter. It includes quests,  "bad guys", leveling up... 

It seems interesting.  I figured I'd share it with you all in case you want to try it out.  We are supposed to have allies in the app. IDK what the allies are meant to do,  but I'll be yours if you need one.  My name the is HuzzardBuzzard. If you can't find me there,  PM me here. I've barely used SuperBetter, so I have very little understanding of how it works. 

ETN: allies don't work this way.  Looks like they are real life people, not in-app people.
