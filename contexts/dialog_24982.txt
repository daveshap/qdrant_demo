BETH: The sub's a 100 feet in front of you. You see it?
NORMAN: I can't see anything. How does it look? Still clear?
BETH: Still clear.
BETH: What's the matter?
NORMAN: You fixed this suit? Beth?
BETH: Yes, Norman. I did. You're just nervous.
NORMAN: My air isn't... I'm coming back.
BETH: You can't. Counter's at 10 minutes. You don't have time.
NORMAN: Still clear?
BETH: Still clear.
