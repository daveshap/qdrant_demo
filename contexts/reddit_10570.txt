You ever get that 'why bother' mentality?
I dont enjoy life. I'm untalented, lonely, failing all of my classes, and am an emotional wreck. Each day is just going through the motions. It's not like I actually enjoy anything, havent been happy in years. Seeing all my friends succeed and excel in the same things I'm struggling to do on a fundamental level just kinda sucks. Being alive has no redeeming qualities. If you're reading a book or watching a movie you dont like, you stop. Why should life be any different? 

Why bother being alive
