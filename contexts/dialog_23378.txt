MARY: Thank you. It was a lovely dinner.
GREGORY: Good.
MARY: But I reel guilty. It doesn't seem right for me to enjoy myself with Jacqueline gone.
GREGORY: You can't make it your life's work looking for Jacqueline. ) You'll have to do other things... live...get some enjoyment out of life. I hope you'll let me help you.
MARY: Thank you.. .goodnight.
GREGORY: Goodnight, Mary.
AUGUST: I've been waitin' for you Miss Gibson. I want you to know I've decided to take your case.
MARY: Mr. August, I'm not at all sure -
AUGUST: Look. Don't say a word. I've taken an interest in you and I'm willin' to put up my time to help you. Besides, I think I know where to find your sister.
MARY: Where?
AUGUST: Wait a minute. This has got a lot of angles. You've got to take it easy. Do you know a Mrs. Redi?
MARY: Yes. She bought my sister's business.
AUGUST: That's what she told you. I looked it up at the Hall of Records. Your sister deeded her the business as an outright girt.
MARY: Why would Mrs. Redi lie to me?
AUGUST: That's what I tried to find out.	I went to La Jeunesse —— -- used a phony health inspector's badge —— they let me go through the works -- all but one room. That room was locked. I'd like to see the inside of that room.
MARY: You think my sister is there?
AUGUST: You can't tell.
MARY: Can we go there now?
AUGUST: Sister, you can't just go breaking into places. There's a night watchman down there and locks on the door.
MARY: If my sister's in that room, it won't make any difference about warrants- and things, I want to go there.
AUGUST: I don't know if I want to go with you or not.
AUGUST: I don't like this.
MARY: Which room is it?
AUGUST: It's the last door at the end of this hall.
AUGUST: You scared?
MARY: Yes.
AUGUST: Let's get out of here.
MARY: No.
