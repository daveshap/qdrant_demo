Problems copying content in Safari Developer Mode When using Safari Developer Mode, I've encountered two oddities:\"Search\" tab: Enter a search, click search result (left), then mark text in source viewer (middle), then click Ctrl+C (or right-click and select Copy). Result : Entire source is copied.\"Elements\" tab: Highlight link: Right-click and select \"Copy Link Address\". Result: Nothing is copied.Am I using it wrong, or are these in fact bugs in Safari?
