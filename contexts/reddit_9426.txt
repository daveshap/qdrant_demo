It's humiliating when you need to bail on plans with friends due to lack of funds
I'm honest with my friends and I trust them not to judge me but having to ditch on regular small things like dinners or movies I feel compelled to tell them that they're still dear to me and can't afford to do that fun thing with them

Of course there's always free things we can do as friends like bike rides and back yard fires, it would crush me if anyone offered to pay for me, I hate feeling in someone's debt
