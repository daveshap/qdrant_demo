ANNIE: It's so cruel.
FRANK: No. He had the choice.
ANNIE: What choice!!?
FRANK: Either fight the way things are or accept it.
DIANE: Oh Frank, don't forget the wedding present -- it's behind the door in the laundry room. I got her a pasta maker from the catalogue... Not that they'll know what to do with it in Branton, Missouri... Probably use it as a planter.
FRANK: Diane!
DIANE: Frank's touchy about his cousins. Well, it was nice to meet you, Mr. MacLean.
