Command Syntax for KRACK pentesting I have been trying to pen test my router with a variety of ways, long story short, it locks out indefinitely with pixie wps until I go to the router admin page and click unlock. I tried DDOS with MDK, but I think it is ignoring me.I had the idea to MITM and use Amazon Cloud, but my calculation is that my password would take years because of it's relative complexity.Finally I read about KRACK and watched the proof of concept video while reading the paper and got stuck in what I think is a syntax newbieness, i.e I understand how it works but I don't know how to properly code it. Would you all please be so kind to point me in some reference material, other than the official krack website and the links in it?To be specific, I am working on the Andoird implementation. I know that I have to block the EAPOL msg 3 twice, send the two of them together to the client to reuse nonce 1. The problem is, how do I translate it into a bash script? That is, once I have MITM position, what would be the best command/algorithm to filter and pass the messages?EDIT: It seems that there is a misunderstanding about my original post. What I mean is that I want to hack my own android device using the KRACK Attack on Kali Linux. To make it clearer, I am trying to make own attack script but I am not sure about the syntax/command to be used. Therefore I am asking for references/books about bash script that is relatable to reproducing the Krack Attack, i.e what I need is more scripting guidance rather than the algorithm of the Krack attack as I have read the original paper. Thank you guys!
