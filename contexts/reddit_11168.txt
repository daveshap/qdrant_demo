I miss having Sex. I miss being in love.
This year my ex girlfriend broke up with me. This was roughly 2 months ago and ever since then, we had very little contact due to the circumstances at hand.

By now, I realised that this was a veery unhealthy relationship since she really used me and did me more harm than love most of the time.
It was hard for me, but as of right now, I would not return to her.

Just today I had a thought, I don't know why.
I had a picture of how we had sex. Everything about it. How we kissed. Her breasts shaking. How I kissed her neck and we kissed each other and said how much we love each other.

I don't just miss the feeling of orgasming to another person, but also miss being with someone. Loving someone.

I am male and 20 and will probably find someone else in the future. But as of right now. I really miss hugging my loved one, waking up to her and talking dirty to each other as well as surprising the other.
