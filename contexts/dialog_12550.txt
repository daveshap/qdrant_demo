THERAPIST: How's the new place?
HIDER: It's great. It's clean and airy and quiet -- there are trees and flowers. There's still some fixing up I have to do, but it's coming along.
THERAPIST: And the rent is okay?
HIDER: Oh, it's nothing. No problem. I was really lucky to find this place.
THERAPIST: All right then. That's important, isn't it? -- For you to be in an up" environment. I'm saying you should literally take that as your <u>base</u>
HIDER: Right.
THERAPIST: And what about work? Have you had any more thoughts about what you'd like to be doing now?
HIDER: Well, I've been doing a little independent contracting, some carpentry here and there, y'know, do-it-yourself-type stuff. I still find it very soothing.
THERAPIST: I'm happy that you're working again. As long as it comes naturally, that's terrific. You've always liked working with your hands, haven't you?
HIDER: Yeah, since I was a kid. I had a woodwork class once when I was... in school that time. Then I learned a lot more when I was in the --
THERAPIST: -- hospital.
HIDER: -- institution.
THERAPIST: Right. So, you have a new place, you've started working a bit -- I'm sure you'll be meeting some new people.
HIDER: Actually, I have met someone. There's a woman I think I like.
THERAPIST: Oh, good -- well, I hope you'll have more to tell me next time.
PHIL: Neil, calm down.
JULIE: Neil, don't leave the back doors open -- I don't want Holly near the pool.
PHIL: We'd have to get one of those sliding covers for the pool.
