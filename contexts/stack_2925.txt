Static electricity\u2014electron donor/acceptor At school, we were taught that in a situation where one material gets rubbed with another, there's a transfer of electrons. This is because the electrons (or charges) jump from one material to the other due to friction. And we were also told that one of the materials tends to be the giving one in the exchange, which we call the electron donor. And the electron acceptor is the one that takes in the electrons offered by the corresponding electron donor.And we were given a table with examples of electron donors and acceptors along with that, of the classic hair/comb sort. When our teacher helpfully added that whether a material acts as an electron donor or acceptor depends on the material it is being rubbed with, it got me thinking.I was wondering if there were certain pairs of electron donor/acceptor. Pairs of specific materials that synchronise with each other. In the sense that one material in the pair exhibits either of these behaviours only in case of the other material in the pair.Say, you\u2019ve got material X which you rub with material Y. It acts as a electron donor perhaps. But it doesn\u2019t always behave like an electron donor. You see that it acts as an electron donor only upon friction with that specific material Y. Do such pairs exist? Hope I had been able to express my question clearly enough.
