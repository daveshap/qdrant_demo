Hi Reddit friends, Please can you be the pushy workaholic dad that I never had and didn’t want but in retrospect absolutely needed?
Hi Reddit! 26 year old guy here in desperate need of wise worldly people for some mentoring and guidance!

**Quick break down of my situation:**

My only goal after graduating university was to travel. I grew up quite poor and so never travelled or had a passport as a kid, so seeing the world was my absolute number one priority.
Since then I’ve lived in New Zealand, California, Vietnam and Cambodia and paid for it all myself doing basic retail and hospitality jobs, mostly for charities. It’s been wonderful and nice but now I’m back in England and suddenly faced with the reality of being pretty much unemployable for anything other than the most basic of work, and it’s a bit depressing going for with 16 year olds of minimum wage jobs. I totally accept it as the price I’ve paid for travelling for so long, but I’d like to get going on a real career as soon as possible! 

**(You can probably skip this next bit but slightly more info if you’d like it and I thought it was kinda well written):**


My parents are a bit like sims that you’ve maxed out on the ‘kind nurturing and dependable’ stats and totally dumped the ‘successful career advice’ ones, which is great for making me not a serial killer but totally unhelpful in terms of being any help in my current situation. The world of professional employment seems like it might as well be the moon for how achievable it seems.
At the moment I have the exact same feeling of unbridled terror as I did the first time I tried to cross a road in Hanoi. Fortunately, once I’d got to grips with how Hanoi worked it became my favourite place in the world, and I have no doubt having a professional career and life will end up the same way! I just really need someone to grab my hand and guide me through the 6,000,000 loud beeping scooters of confusion between me and the questionable street food vendor that in this terrible metaphor represents my career.


I’m working part time in a vegan wholefoods co-operative at the moment which is a nice work environment and allows a lot of freedom with when and how much I work, but I’m definitely ready to start a career and try and get employed somewhere that has long term security and means I’ll be working with adults rather than 16 year olds!


**The actual important bit! (Finally):**

I have an undergraduate degree in Radio production and Technology (Bsc) which is pretty useless so I’ve just been looking into perhaps studying either a conversion course or just going on to do a masters that will make me more employable at something. I’d love no nonsense professional advice on what masters would be achievable with my degree and would equip me to start work in a particular field upon completion.


My degree is a science based degree but it only vaguely touched on coding or anything like that and it was a hell of a long time ago, but I wouldn’t be adverse to studying that more! My only real concern at the moment is I don’t want to waste more time. I don’t want to study a masters/conversion course that just puts me back in this position in 1 or 2 years time!


Becoming a teacher is definitely an option that is up for consideration, but I know it’s arrogant to think I could just ‘fall into’ teaching as a back up option, so any advice from teachers who have maybe been in my situation is great too!


**TOO LONG DIDN’T READ AND BECAME INFURIATED:**

What I’m getting at is that I am ready to start my career and quite open about what that career could entail! My only concern is that I want to study/pursue something that will really help and progress my career prospects. My biggest fear is going to study something then end up back at square one after graduating! What can I work towards right this second that will give me genuine prospects and options in 2 years time?

I just want to make sure I’m on the path to somewhere as opposed to wasting time getting older and I have nobody in my life to sit me down, tell me I’m a dissapointment and explain the options and the pitfalls in front of me, so you have to be my dad reddit. Get your shit together.

Thanks in advance for anyone who has actually managed to read this far, any input appreciated!
