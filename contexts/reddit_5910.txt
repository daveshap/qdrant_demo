So I plan on getting a BS in Biotechnology and MSc in Animal Molecular and Cellular Biology
So, as the title states, I want to study Biotechnology as an undergrad and Animal Molecular and Cellular Biology in grad school. I am currently working on my AA degree right now, but have no concrete idea on my job opportunities after getting each of these degrees. I know I may be jumping the gun, but I am just curious on how useful these degrees will be. That being said, I thought it wouldn't hurt to ask you guys a few questions.

1. I heard it's hard to get a job with a Biotechnology degree, especially if you don't live in the right place. I live in Florida, how good are my chances of landing a job and how much should I expect to make?
2. With a BS in Biotech, what type of jobs would I have available to me? (Research, academia, etc.)
3. Considering I don't change my mind later on, what value would a Master's in Animal Molecular and Cellular Biology have when it comes to me getting a job? Would it be at all useful compared to other grad degrees I could go for? (Bioengineering, bioinformatics, etc.)
4. Would I be limiting myself with this potential Masters since it is ***Animal*** Molecular and Cellular Biology or am I just overthinking it?
5. After getting these degrees, would job hunting be a lot easier for me or would it be just as much a struggle as with other bio-degrees?
6. What can I do to help better my chances of getting a job whenever I get either of these degrees?

I don't plan on getting a PhD because I feel like that's not for me, so I'm hoping I can still be successful with these two degrees if I like them as much as I think I will and pursue them. Any advice or answers will be greatly appreciated.
