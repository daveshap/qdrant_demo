BIG NURSE: Was it your idea to visit her on Sunday?
BILLY: Y-y-y-yes...
BIG NURSE: Tell us about it...
BILLY: I-I-I-I c-c-c-came over S-S-S Sunday m-m-m-morning after ch-ch-ch church and br-br-brought her s-s some flowers, and I s-s-said, I said, 'C-C-C-Celia, will you muh muh-muh-muh-muh...' till the girl broke out l-l-laughing.
BIG NURSE: What was it about her that disturbed you so, Billy?
BILLY: I was in luh-love with her.
BIG NURSE: Billy, were you afraid of her, or of her love?
BIG NURSE: That was the first time you attempted to commit suicide, wasn't it? You must try to talk about it, Billy.
MCMURPHY: Jesus Christ, the man doesn't want to talk, so get off his back an' let's get on to some new business.
BIG NURSE: Mister McMurphy, the purpose of this meeting is therapy. Group therapy.
MCMURPHY: Yeah, yeah, the hell with that crap! The World Series is goin' on right' now an' that's therapy also!
BIG NURSE: Let me pose a question to the group: do any of you feel that Mister McMurphy is perhaps imposing his personal desires on you too much?
MCMURPHY: What the hell does that have to do with it? This is an important event and I want a vote on it!
