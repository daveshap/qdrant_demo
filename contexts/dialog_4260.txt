DULANEY: Yeah.
REBECCA: Andrew loved this old cabin. He always dreamed about moving to Tahiti -- living in a hut and becoming a beach-bum. I could never imagine myself doing that -- but somehow when he talked about it, he made it sound so alive - - so wonderful. Soft ocean breezes and beautiful sunsets -- leaving the world and it's problems behind. I wish he'd had a chance to do it.
REBECCA: Sorry.
DULANEY: It's okay.
DULANEY: Tell me about Doctor Paley?
REBECCA: I hardly know him. He wanted me and he couldn't have me.
DULANEY: It's going to be hard to convince a jury that he's testifying against you in a murder trial because you blew him off.
REBECCA: It won't be that hard.
REBECCA: Did you always want to be a lawyer?
DULANEY: No -- I wanted to be a professional hockey player.
REBECCA: Really?
DULANEY: Yeah.
REBECCA: That seems so far away from who you are now. What happened?
DULANEY: I broke my ankle skating. That ended that dream.
REBECCA: It's hard to let go of a dream, isn't it? To let go of what you want?
