GUS: Got vodka in it now. Gotta give it a new name. Hey, listen, you thought it up, we'll name it after you. What's your name?
BRAD: Brad.
GUS: Brad is not a good name for a cocktail.
BRAD: Hey! Y'know what they used to call me in high school?
GUS: Brad?
BRAD: No, no, on the football field. They called me... ...The Smallville Flash.
GUS: Hey, man, that's a great name for a cocktail!
