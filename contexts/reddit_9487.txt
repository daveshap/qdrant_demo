Iâ€™m not at what anyone would consider the poverty level, but I do have a terrible habit that causes me to live paycheck to paycheck and has put me into some scary situations here and there.

I have money automatically deposited into my savings account every paycheck. I also have a certain amount that I put into a second checking account that my regular bills come out of. My primary checking is for groceries, gas, and some spending money.

So I have this HORRIBLE habit of overspending. And itâ€™s not because I buy crap because I want it... Iâ€™m just buying things I genuinely need, like an apron so I donâ€™t ruin my clothes when I cook (Iâ€™m messy and keto involves a lot of fatty foods lol). No, my one big spending problem is eating out. I kind of panic if I donâ€™t eat breakfast because I donâ€™t have time to eat lunch and breakfast ends up being my only meal until dinner.

Anyway... about this time in the pay cycle (four days until payday) Iâ€™ll have to start transferring money from that savings account to my primary checking account because I only have $11 left or something. Iâ€™m not exaggerating. This is twice a month this happens. Every. Damn. Time.

But this month!!! This month I made some changes. I said no to frivolous purchases (passed on a beautiful robe on the clearance rack to replace my slightly worn one), took my lunch to work, made dinner with leftovers to spare, was a lot smarter about how much food I purchased (from a big family, hard to learn to just cook for two), and got creative with cheaper recipes like different types of salads. The biggest thing I did was say no to eating out. Iâ€™m not actually hungry, Iâ€™m just not planning ahead and panicking when I think I wonâ€™t eat for the rest of the day.

Whatâ€™s amazing is that I didnâ€™t actually sacrifice that much! I was able to spend $50 on new workout pants and bras. I took my boyfriend out for a drink on Easter Sunday. I even bought myself a Starbucks.

And here I am, sitting on $52.81 for the rest of the week!  THIS FEELS AMAZING! Just those changes made a massive difference! I actually kept what I put aside in my savings account (I officially have $405 now). And I donâ€™t need to spend that whole $52.81. I know I can make some of the veggies from last week go into meals this week and I have lots of deli meat, eggs, and bacon left. So I plan to grocery shop for what I need for the week and if I have any money remaining, itâ€™s going into that savings account... and then Iâ€™m going to do the same thing this next paycheck. Hooray for SAVINGS!!!!!
