Quicktime 10 - export in original size, not 4k, 1080p, 720p etc? I do a lot of non full size screen recordings, e.g., they could be small such as 320x240 or in completely non-standard sizes and proportions like 1500x300. I want to save them using HEVC (rather than the default H.264).In QTP HEVC is only available using File -> Export but that way I can only use a couple of standard dimensions (4k, 1080p, 720p and 480p).How can I use both HEVC and a non-standard format in QTP10?
