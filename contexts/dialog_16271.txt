DOG: I want you to search the house for bugs. I mean I want you to strip it.
JOHN: What is the point in that? Even if it was a bug they would have taken it with 'em.
DOG: It is too late for you to start thinking John. It is a possibility and that is good enough for me. And after you strip the house, I want you to get every thieving slag this side of Ceylon and torture them, badly. I want to know who is responsible, otherwise I will hold you responsible.
