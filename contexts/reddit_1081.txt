Was finally getting my life together, then this whole Coronavirus situation happened.
I've made a lot of progress over the last couple months, in terms of both managing my anxiety and improving my overall life. I've been going out much more often and been stepping out of my comfort zone, but I feel like all my progress is slowly being reverted. My anxiety is starting to get worse daily along with my overall habits. I don't know if i am the only one in this situation but it just fucking sucks.
