DIETER: Who is your friend?
RENE: We met on the beach.
DIETER: Join us.
JOE: I don't want to intrude.
DIETER: We insist.
JOE: Al Viola.
DIETER: That name's familiar.
JOE: It is to me too.
DIETER: You remind me of someone. You from the west coast?
AL: He recognises you, throw him off.
JOE: My coast is Maine, actually. We have a place in Bar Harbor...And a bar in Sutton Place.
AL: Don't get too cute.
