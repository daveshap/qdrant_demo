DON CORLEONE: All right, Hollywood...Now tell me about this Hollywood Pezzonovanta who won't let you work.
JOHNNY: He owns the studio. Just a month ago he bought the movie rights to this book, a best seller. And the main character is a guy just like me. I wouldn't even have to act, just be myself.
DON CORLEONE: You take care of your family?
JOHNNY: Sure.
DON CORLEONE: You look terrible. I want you to eat well, to rest. And spend time with your family. And then, at the end of the month, this big shot will give you the part you want.
JOHNNY: It's too late. All the contracts have been signed, they're almost ready to shoot.
DON CORLEONE: I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.
