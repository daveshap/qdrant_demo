GEORGE: Zuzu! What's the matter with Zuzu?
MARY: Oh, she's got a cold. She's in bed. Caught it coming home from school. They gave her a flower for a prize and she didn't want to crush it so she didn't button up her coat.
GEORGE: What is it, a sore throat or what?
MARY: Just a cold. The doctor says it's nothing serious.
GEORGE: The doctor? Was the doctor here?
MARY: Yes, I called him right away. He says it's nothing to worry about.
GEORGE: Is she running a temperature? What is it?
MARY: Just a teensie one –– ninety-nine, six. She'll be all right.
