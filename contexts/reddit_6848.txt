Should I be looking for a new job now?
3 of my companies branches(child care centers) have closed within the last year. Two were due to low enrollment alone, then the third one was that mixed with Covid. My location is the highest earner in the area much less within the company, so I've never been worried until now. We were also were all sold to new higher-ups about 6 months ago, which I didn't think anything of at the time but now I feel like it means something. Should I be looking, are these warning signs or is it normal buisness, not everyone can make it?
