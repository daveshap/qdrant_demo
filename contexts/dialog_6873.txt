KATHRYN: Calm down. Tell me what's wrong.
CECILE: Something awful happened last night.
KATHRYN: What do you mean?!
CECILE: I... I don't think you want to know.
KATHRYN: Cecile, you have to tell me.
CECILE: It involves your brother. He... took advantage of me.
KATHRYN: Does your mother know?
CECILE: If she knew, she'd kill me. It happened at your house last night.
KATHRYN: Why didn't you do something?
CECILE: I don't know.
KATHRYN: So, let me get this straight. You came over to our house late last night and he forced intercourse on you.
CECILE: Well... not exactly.
KATHRYN: He made you give him a blow job.
CECILE: No.
KATHRYN: Well what then?
CECILE: If that's what you call it.
KATHRYN: Cecile, I think you're going to have a hard time crying rape if that's all he did.
CECILE: What do I do then?
KATHRYN: Well did you like it?
CECILE: Well... I don't know - it was weird. At first it felt icky, then it felt kind of okay. Then, I started getting really hot and then I started shaking and then like, I don't t know... it felt like an explosion, but a good one.
KATHRYN: Cecile, you had an orgasm.
CECILE: I did?
KATHRYN: I'm so proud of you. You're becoming a woman.
CECILE: I am?
KATHRYN: Now listen. Now that you're on your way, it would be stupid of you to stop. Think of Sebastian as a tutor. Let him instruct you.
CECILE: I don't love him. I love Ronald.
KATHRYN: So? Don't you want to make Ronald a happy pappy? Practice makes perfect, Cecile. My advice is to sleep with as many people as possible.
CECILE: But that would make me a slut. Wouldn't it?
KATHRYN: Cecile, everybody does it. It's just that nobody talks about it.
CECILE: It's like a secret society.
KATHRYN: That's one way of looking at it.
CECILE: Cool.
KATHRYN: I just had a nice chat with Cecile. I don't think she'll be giving you anymore problems.
SEBASTIAN: Yippy.
KATHRYN: Who are you spying on?
SEBASTIAN: Take a look for yourself.
KATHRYN: That her?
SEBASTIAN: Yeah.
KATHRYN: Jesus, she reeks of Laura Ashley. Oh, she's crying. Wittle baby's upset by the big bad book.
SEBASTIAN: Shut up.
KATHRYN: What's your problem?
SEBASTIAN: Nothing.
KATHRYN: She's really getting to you, isn't she?
SEBASTIAN: If you must know, yes. I don't know what to do. I can't stand that holier than thou bullshit and yet, I'm completely infatuated with her. She made me laugh.
KATHRYN: And that's why you're losing your bet?
SEBASTIAN: I'm not losing the bet. It's just taking longer than I expected.
KATHRYN: Do you mind if I take my new Porsche for a ride?
SEBASTIAN: Kathryn, the only thing you're going to be riding is me. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some work to do.
SEBASTIAN: Am I bothering you?
ANNETTE: Not at all. Have a seat.
