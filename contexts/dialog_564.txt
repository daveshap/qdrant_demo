LARIVIERE: What's the hurry?
WADE: A hunting accident. Jack and Twombley.
LARIVIERE: Huh?
WADE: I figured you already heard.
LARIVIERE: Twombley, Jesus. We got to get moving: I got to get up there. How would I know? C'mon, you drive. We'll take my truck.
LARIVIERE: Fuck. Turn it off. All you heard was there was some kinda accident?
WADE: Twombley's shot. I heard that. Not Jack. He's okay, I assume.
LARIVIERE: Fuck. You don't know how bad or anything?
WADE: You mean Twombley?
LARIVIERE: Yes, Wade, I mean Twombley. Put out that cigarette. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.
WADE: He more than likely just shot himself in the foot or something. That's what usually happens.
LARIVIERE: I shoulda sent you instead of Jack.
WADE: I wish you had. I'd rather be deer hunting instead of freezing my ass on that fucking grader.
LARIVIERE: You ain't the hunter Jack is. And he can't drive the grader worth shit.
WADE: Like hell.
LARIVIERE: That must've been Twombley. Jesus. I bet that was Twombley.
WADE: You want me to follow them to Littleton?
LARIVIERE: Let's get to the top and talk to Jack first. He'll know what happened. He fucking better. If this coulda been avoided, I'll put that kid's ass in a sling.
JACK: You heard the news.
LARIVIERE: I hear Twombley got shot.
JACK: Yeah.
