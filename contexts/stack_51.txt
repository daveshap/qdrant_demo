Multiple iPhones and iPads with same Apple id My husband has his personal iPhone 5s and iPad Air 2 and he also has an iPhone 6 and iPad Air 2 for his work. He wants to change the \"work iPhone 6 and iPad Air 2\" to a new Apple id not associated with his personal Apple id (icloud ??). I am trying to help, but I am not familiar with Apple iPhones etc. He uses his personal email for his Apple id for all of devices, but separate email addresses. How do I change his work devices without losing contacts, pictures etc. I am not sure if all devices are uploading information into the iCloud - (how can I find out?).I am so frustrated with reading so many things on the internet, I am scared to try to accomplish this for him. He doesn't have a clue on any tech things, so he is of no use to me to help. Also, he wants to change his personal iPhone 5s to an iPhone 6 Plus (without losing his stuff). I think I need some really good to help me to accomplish this without losing any contacts, photos, etc. Can someone help me? Thanks in advance!
