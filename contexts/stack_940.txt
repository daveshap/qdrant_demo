PulseEffects doesn't run I use UbuntuStudio 18.04.1 LTS inside 4 computers.Since last Ubuntu standard updating (security, mostly), in one of my desktop computers PulseEffects doesn't run anymore. This very good program runs without problems in all the other 3 computers.I try to run the program with the line command option and I get this message:<blockquote>  Assertion 'o' failed at pulse/operation.c:133, function  pa_operation_get_state().    Aborting.    Abortado (`core' generado)</blockquote>The only one difference between this desktop computer and the other 3, is about this installation has been upgrading since Lubuntu 15.x. The others have been installed from UbuntuStudio 18.04.1 LTS LiveCD.What is wrong here?How can I fix this?
