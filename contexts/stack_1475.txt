YM2612 Circuit Audio Signal Offset Voltage I've been working on a project messing around with the YM2612 soundchip and hooking it up to a microcontroller.  I'm able to drive the chip, but I'm having a little trouble with the audio part of the circuit.I have a 10k\u03a9  pulldown resistor on one of the outputs of the chip (I'm only testing this output for the time being). I've noticed that there appears to be some kind of voltage offset at the output of the chip. I'm still learning about electronics, so I'm not fully sure how to look this up, other than what I think is messing with the \"voltage bias\but in most cases, it seems to be about raising the signal's offset instead of lowering it. The signal seems to be the normal audio signal, but instead of being based around 0v as the center, it's about 2.8ish volts or so.  I was trying to amplify the signal since it's a very low audio signal, but with the voltage offset, I feel like using an op-amp just to amplify the signal, with it always being at ~2.8v I won't be getting as much gain as I'd like to (using a 5v supply for this). I'm sorry if some of my terminology is mixed up. I'm happy to elaborate on anything I might have forgotten, but would really love any help or advice you can provide on how to handle the audio output circuit. Oh, btw, I don't want to directly hook this up to a speaker or anything, this is just about obtaining line level for headphones or something of that nature.
