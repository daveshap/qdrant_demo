MAGUIRE: Do you want a cup of tea?
FERGUS: See does he want some.
JUDE: Do you want some food?
FERGUS: Hey -- what's he like?
JUDE: Horny bastard.
FERGUS: Did you give him it?
JUDE: There are certain things I wouldn't do for my country.
FERGUS: Have a look at him.
JUDE: Can't.
FERGUS: Poke him or something. See if he's still alive.
JUDE: He's all right.
FERGUS: Hasn't moved for twelve hours. Go on. Have a heart.
