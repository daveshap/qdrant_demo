DoTA 2 freeze when trying to open audio settings (Ubuntu 18.04) so I've a problem here. I've just install DoTA 2 through Steam today. Everythings is working no problem except for one thing. Every time I want to go to audio settings page, its just freeze. I know it's not a big problem because I still can playing the games but it's just bother me a lot. I really want to settings my microphone, speakers, music volume, and etc.I don't think it's audio drivers problem since the games still having audio on. I really appreciate if you want to help me, Thanks!EDITProblems solved after i run the game via Terminal. I don't know why, since then my audio settings page can be accessed.
