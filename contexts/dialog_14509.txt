QUINT: Did you bring a check?
BRODY: What?
QUINT: Cash? Or do we do this on a handshake and a promise?
BRODY: I'm authorized by the township of Amity to hire you as an independent contractor. We'll meet your price. $10,000.
QUINT: And my regular daily rate -- $200, whether we catch him or not.
BRODY: You got it.
QUINT: And incidental damages, if any...
BRODY: You got it.
QUINT: And you get the Mayor off my back with this zoning crap. Nobody tells me how to run my property.
BRODY: You got it.
QUINT: And, uh, a case of apricot brandy and you buy the lunch.
BRODY: Two cases. And dinner when you land.
QUINT: Try some of this. I made it myself.
