Using Raster Quartiles in ArcMap? I have two raster layers with a count and value in the attribute table but when I try to reclassify with count and equal interval quartiles the classification reverts back to \"value\" in the symbology. I need to be able to get the symbology  to be based on count and not value. This is important because I need to create a new layer such that only the highest quartiles from the 2 layers are shown. How can this be accomplished? Regarding previous operations I needed to specify certain land cover features such that water was removed so I used a reclassify and then ascribed nodata to water...then I used a extract by mask so the DEM layer also removed water. Then I performed 2 different hillshades with different azimuth and altitudes and these layers are what need to be classified correctly so they can be added.
