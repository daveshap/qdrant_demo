I saved my first $500 ever by removing by savings account from online banking.
Pretty straight forward. I'm living paycheck to paycheck. I've never been able to save more than $100. Anytime an automatic transfer was made to my savings account, I would transfer it back. I also have Wells Fargo, so anytime I purchase something, a dollar gets transferred to savings - only to be put back into checking. 

 In December I decided to remove my savings account from my online banking. This does *not* close your account, it simply makes it inaccessible from your online banking. By doing this, it prevented me from logging in and transferring money easily back to checking. If I really needed it,  I could go to the bank and make the transfer. 

Lo and behold, I learned to budget without the extra money and haven't touched a penny in my savings. Today I went to the bank and realized I now have over $500 saved. It feels so good and so surreal. I also feel *relief*. It's so stressful knowing that at any moment, my car could break down or something else could happen out of my control and I wouldn't have a place to start making up for it. 

Anyways, if this helps anyone, then I'll be happy.
