How do some people change careers so easily?
For example, I was reading an article recently and it mentioned this woman.

During her career, she worked as a chief publicist in multiple countries, owned an online activeware company, was a therapeutic riding instructor, and developed waterproof shoe covers. And she’s only in like her 40’s! And only has 1 undergrad degree in psychology!

How the heck does one person accomplish so much? Is it money, connections, good timing, work ethic, having versatile skills, luck? A combination of factors?

Then you have someone else for example, who has like a Masters degree or something, and it stuck working retail for years and is dying to get out.

Or maybe you have someone who is an accountant, and wants to become an engineer. They would have to spend years and thousands of dollars to change careers, whereas some people switch fields like it’s nothing?

How come some people are able to do so much, while others just flounder?

Just curious. Thank you!

EDIT: Wow, thank everyone!! I didn’t think anyone would respond to this!! I can’t wait to get home so I can read through everyone’s replies! :)
