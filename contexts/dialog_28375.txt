FLOYD: We got word from Chicago. They got one of the grifters last night. The nigger.
LONNEGAN: What about the other one?
FLOYD: They're still looking for him.
LONNEGAN: Who's got the contract?
FLOYD: Combs gave it to Reilly and Cole.
LONNEGAN: Hackers.
FLOYD: They staked out the other guy's place last night, but he never showed. They figure maybe he skipped town. You wanna follow 'em up?
