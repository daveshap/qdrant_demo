GEORGE: My name's George Kovich. Bet you've heard of me.
SAILOR: Don't know that I have... Should I know about you for anythin' in particular?
GEORGE: Was in all the papers three years ago. I'm seventy-six, was only seventy- three then. Had a business in Buffalo, New York, called Rats With Wings. Killed pigeons for anyone who wanted 'em killed.
