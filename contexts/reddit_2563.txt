I sold my soul to the film industry at 18 and finally have the means to get out. What should I do with my life?
Hi I'm 28yo Canadian and have worked in the film industry since high school starting as a production assistant and moving up. My job has been my whole life. The money is good but I work soooo much. I work an extreme amount - 80 hours a week. Sometimes I have weeks with no work and sometimes I work 10 months in a row non-stop. 

My mental health is suffering now that I'm older -- I can't sustain this lifestyle, I want different things, some free time and money doesn't matter as much. I would be happy 40-50k a year. My personality type is INTP if that helps.

I want to...

work in an office setting, good job prospects, courses that are less than 1 year and cost less than 10k to complete.

I have no bachelors degree or any skills outside of my industry. I am very hard-working and feel like I'm capable of a lot. I don't even have any interests outside my industry that would be applicable to other careers... :( 

Do not want to go into healthcare or trades. 

Options I am thinking of:

PCP (payroll certificate in Canada) -Has anyone done this? Getting a job doing payroll --again don't know if I can get hired without having an HR or Accounting designation. 

Programming -- Don't know where to start here, I am thinking of learning a language (Python) or going to a coding bootcamp oe doing a udemy course. 

Feel overwhelmed with the choices and don't know if learning programming languages but having no formal computer science education will let me get a job. 

Please suggest me anything!
