I was laid off for the first time (context: I’m 20 years old)
My boss laid me off on 6:00pm on New Year’s Eve. This was my first time ever ‘losing’ a job; however, I am not the only one he has done this to. He’s done it to many employees on the same day, because there is no business. However, he said he would contact me in February, when it starts to get busy again. I work at a liquor store, in westchester NY (I miss the job mainly bc the pay was good and the coworkers were awesome) 

should I take this with a grain of salt? Or start looking for another job? 

I’m really lost as of what to do. It’s making me really anxious about not having a income as a part time student, even though I am blessed to have parents that will help me out. 

Sorry if this seems all over the place, I don’t know what else to do.
