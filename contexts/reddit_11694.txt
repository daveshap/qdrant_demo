i dont want to be here anymore
I feel so worthless, my boyfriend can't take the responsibility in arguments that would happen and he always tells me everything that I'm doing wrong and when I mention what he does wrong he says I'm just trying to turn it around on him and victimize myself. He hardly apologizes while no matter how many times I apologize to him he acts like he forgives me but brings it up later about how horrible of a person I am. It takes two to argue and we're both in the wrong. He starts yelling at me and cussing but I just stop talking after that while he tells me how I do everything wrong. I just feel unhappy with my life. I'm struggling in college, my parents are distant with me, I have no friends, I just feel so alone. I wish I could leave somewhere and never come back. I'm not good enough for anything.
