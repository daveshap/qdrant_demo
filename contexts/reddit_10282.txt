Going to fight corona soon
In a few hours my alarm will sound to wake me up for work. Work in a hospital, diagnosing and treating corona patients. I wish I could sleep, I could really use some rest before the shift.

But I am writing my suicide note and it is getting so long. I am writing about how I have been harassed and bullied by people I don't know. Who attacked me and yelled at me on the street when I was only trying to go home. I want someone to know, and sympathize with me, but I have never told anyone except reddit. I must really be repulsive when I offend people whom i don't even know.

Noone would read my suicide note. I don't have a single friend. At 30 years of age I have never been in a relationship. I have no family. Who would read this? 

I've written a suicide note every week for 10 years. But I just can't seem to end myself. I wish I could absorb the illnesses of my patients, like a superpower that lets them go home to their families and lets me die. Maybe I would be remembered as a hero.

I wish someone would read my note. But noone will. I have another meeting with corona in a few hours.

Edit: I am a transgender person, that's why people harass me. I suppose they think I am ugly and repulsive. I dont mind if you call me guy, they call me worse things but I wish I wasn't one. Anyway thank you for the sympathetic replies. Sorry, I don't know how to respond because it feels like noone can understand what it is like to feel like everyone hates you. I wish there were more of you out there instead of all these people who will hate you even though you're not hurting anyone. Thank you for saying something nice to a stranger.
