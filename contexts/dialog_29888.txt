DONNA: Laura?
LAURA: Donna, are you my best friend?
DONNA: Of course...
DONNA: What is it Laura? What's wrong?
LAURA: I just want a friend. Just one friend for just one minute...
DONNA: Laura, how about one friend for the rest of your whole life?
LAURA: Yes, that's what I want. Thanks D.
DONNA: Okay, L. I am your friend... always. But sometimes... lately... I feel that you don't like being around me because I am so uptight. No, I am uptight. I hate it... I don't want to be this way, but Laura I don't... I mean... I'm your friend no matter what way you are.
LAURA: You know, even when I think about your face I get happier.
DONNA: Do you want to talk?
LAURA: No, I want to smoke.
DONNA: I'm in a mess today, too. I'm thinking about doing it with Mike. What do you think?
LAURA: Donna, you are such a crack up. You don't even like Mike. Is this what you are going to do to show me you are not uptight.
DONNA: This is about sex, not like. Mom, Laura's here and I think I will have one of those huckleberry muffins. You want a muffin?
LAURA: If I can smoke it.
DONNA: You want a muffin?
LAURA: Donna, you are a muffin.
