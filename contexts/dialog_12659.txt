MCCLEOD: Must you do that?
CAVANAUGH: What?
MCCLEOD: Sing.
CAVANAUGH: It is a beautiful day. I am merely enjoying it.
MCCLEOD: Can't you enjoy it quietly?
CAVANAUGH: Are you always this pleasant? You know what you're problem is?
MCCLEOD: You?
CAVANAUGH: Life. You've stopped living it. You look, but you do not see. You listen but, you do not hear.
MCCLEOD: I hear you.
CAVANAUGH: What else? What else do you hear right now?
MCCLEOD: The river.
CAVANAUGH: That's all?
MCCLEOD: Yes.
CAVANAUGH: Do you not hear the wind in the trees? The songs of the birds. The horses breath? There is a whole world around you. Alive. Living. Feel it -- become part of it. Live your life, Highlander. It's going to be a long one.
MCCLEOD: That is what bothers me.
CAVANAUGH: I see. You don't care about life anymore.
