Get Unemployment Benefits From a Year Ago?
I do not have American citizenship. I was employed (W2) in Illinois from 2012-2019 with the same company that also sponsored by a work visa. 

I started my green card process in April 2019 and received it in September 2019. 

I got laid off in June 2019 and did NOT have a green card at the time so I couldn't get unemployment benefits. 

From July 2019 to April 2020 I was an entrepreneur (no W2 nor 1099), living off of my savings, and I never ever received any wage/money (not even cash) at all ever since I got laid off. Today I'm running out of money and cannot continue working for free so I am looking for a full-time job. 

I am wondering if I can retro-actively benefit from unemployment insurance for as long as I can in the past? 

I tried to call the hotline at the Illinois Department Employment Security (IDES) but I could never get ahold of anyone. I'm genuinely trying to see what I can legally get from the government (if anything) considering my work history.
