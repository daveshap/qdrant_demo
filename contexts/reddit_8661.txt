When does a president's economic record begin?
I want to acknowledge at the outset that a president doesn't have sole control over the economy. There are a variety of other factors working in concert, and many have nothing to do with the president, or even government policy in general, so I'm expecting that a lot of this is just undeterminable. 

Nevertheless, every US election cycle is peppered with arguments about who to credit or blame for the state of the economy, and most of them come down to timing: Did the president inherit the problems, or were they a result of his own policies?

For example, the [dot-com bubble burst](https://worldhistoryproject.org/2000/3/13/the-market-opens-4-lower-on-monday-than-it-closed-on-friday) at the end of the Clinton administration, but GW Bush was primarily the one to deal with the fallout. In turn, the [Great Recession hit full stride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession_in_the_United_States) at the end of Bush's term, but it was mostly Obama who had to deal with that one. 

At present, we've got the president-elect receiving credit for some economic changes — such as manufacturing shifts at [Carrier](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/29/donald-trump-indiana-factory-jobs-carrier-mexico) and [Ford](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/trump-thanks-ford-motor-company-233172) — before even taking office. He has also [claimed credit for a December jump in the Consumer Confidence Index.](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/trump-on-soaring-consumer-confidence-thanks-donald-2016-12-28)

If it weren't for situations like those, I'd be tempted to suggest we should start assigning credit/blame when the President's [first budget takes effect,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_budget) which, if it is approved on time, would be October of the year of inauguration, or nearly a year after the election. Using that standard, the Obama administration has overseen continual growth in [GDP](http://imgur.com/a/DtV1c) and [employment,](http://cdn.tradingeconomics.com/embed/?s=usurtot&v=201701061339r&d1=20070101&d2=20171231&h=300&w=600) but also the continued trend of [widening income inequality.](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/12/america-income-inequality-wealth-net-worth-charts)

So, before the inauguration of a new president, I'd like to see if we can quantify some of this stuff. Is there a way to break down which economic policy outcomes can be attributed to which administration? Can reasonably solid causation be determined, or is any metric inherently subjective?
