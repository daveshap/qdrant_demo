TUZEE: Worst case, it's a bloodbath. The detectives come out with Smith's computer, and we go directly to jail, do not pass Go.
BENZA: Maybe Glen already picked up the disks.
TUZEE: I took the call from Glen personally. They're still in Smith's house.
FISCHER: Maybe we're getting too dramatic. It's three kids. They'll give up, the cops will arrest them, and that's that. Why would they search the house?
BENZA: You think we should take that chance?
FISCHER: I guess not.
BENZA: I guess not, too. How much information is in the house?
