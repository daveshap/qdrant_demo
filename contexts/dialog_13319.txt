NATHAN: Oh, Hi, Gabrielle.
GABRIELLE: Hi. I just wanted to tell you that I very much enjoy working with you. Now I'm embarrassed that I say this.
NATHAN: No. Don't be. I really enjoy hearing that. You're a terrific assistant.
GABRIELLE: Merci. I... Do you... would you like to go get a cup of coffee, perhaps?
NATHAN: Well, I don't know. I'm actually on my way to...
GABRIELLE: Now I am truly embarrassed. Forgive me. I should not have asked such a stupid question. I know you are a very important man and...
NATHAN: No. Don't be silly. It's just...
GABRIELLE: I am a foolish little thing. I am pink in my face, no? It is only that I have been so lonely lately and... I am ashamed. I'll see you tomorrow, okay? Unless... Am I fired now?
GABRIELLE: Thank you so much for accompanying me.
NATHAN: Not at all.
GABRIELLE: I have had such a difficult time in my personal life and you seem to be such a nice man... but I'm talking too much again, no?
NATHAN: Of course not.
GABRIELLE: You're so sweet. Oh, why are there not more men out there like you?
