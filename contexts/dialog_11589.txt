ROY: Sure I am. What made you turn up, after all these years?
LILLY: I'm working down in San Diego. Just for a few weeks. Thought I'd drop in on my long-lost son.
ROY: Nice to see you. What am I doing in here?
MYRA: You were bleeding inside, honey. Remember that bruise you had?
ROY: You called the doctor, huh?
MYRA: Well, no, Roy. Your mother found you.
ROY: Oh, yeah? Thanks. How long do they say I'm in here?
