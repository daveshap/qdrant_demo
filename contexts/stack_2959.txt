2D CFT for a Senior Undergraduate I'm a senior undergraduate having a good background in QM, Linear Algebra, Tensor Calculus, Complex Analysis, and GR. This year I'm doing my graduation project on 2D CFT (especially aiming towards conformal and modular bootstrapping), so I downloaded some material (specifically Introduction to CFT with application to string theory) and started working on them, however I found myself struggling to understand most of the derivations. Is there any source that present this material in a completely straightforward manner or any other sources that would help me understand?Thanks in advance your help is greatly appreciated!
