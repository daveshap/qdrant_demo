Funding for international postgraduate students in Spain
Hi all, 
Sorry for this dull question but I can't seem to get a clear answer on whether or not I can get a graduate loan (or grant.. if that still exists!) as an EU student studying on a masters course in Spain?  I'm thinking of the Erasmus+ loan in particular. Anyone out there have any recent experience of this? Or any experience of banks you've banked with in Spain as an international student would also be helpful. Thanks in advance
