JASPER: Daddy! Where have you been?
JIM: Hi, Freckle Face.
LIZ: Hi.
JIM: Tough day.
LIZ: My sympathies.
JIM: Liz, I'm really sorry. The meeting went much longer than expected.
LIZ: We waited for you... hours, Jim. You could have telephoned, for God's sake. It's Easter! You promised, Jim.
JIM: I don't know what to say except I'm sorry. I just don't have rabbits on my mind.
LIZ: I think you care more about John Kennedy than your family! All day long the kids are asking, Where's Daddy?" What am I supposed to tell your kids
JIM: I don't know what to tell them. How 'bout the truth - I'm doing my job to make sure they can grow up in a country where justice won't be an arcane, vanished idea they read about in history books, like the dinosaurs or the lost continent of Atlantis.
LIZ: That sounds dandy, but it doesn't replace a father and a husband on Easter Day.
JIM: It's going to get worse, honey.
