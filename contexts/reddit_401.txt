Could really use some advice!
I'm a 16 year old male and I have fallen in love with this girl (she is a German exchange student who will leave in a year), she is very smart and really quite beautiful, but one of my best friends is also interested in her. He doesn't know that I have a crush and things seem to be moving pretty fast between them. I really like the guy he is a real genuine nice person but it's so crushing seeing them together, how he makes her laugh and smile and how I know that I could never do that ( I have tried so many times but it always comes off as awkward).

Maybe even worse is that it even seems that the majority of my friends (who aren't even trying) are closer to her than I am and in conversations it seems like I am just left behind and a bit ignored. I am frustrated with myself because I have had so many opportunities to make her smile, I take the exact same subjects as she does (by coincidence) and sit next or close to her in 2 of them, but it almost never works. I have even started learning German to have something to talk about with her (it's going surprisingly well) but hasn't really helped much aside from once or twice. it just feels so pointless to try.
