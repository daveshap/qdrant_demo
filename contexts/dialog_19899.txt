WILLIAM: To be able to do that is such a wonderful thing.
ANNA: You've got to go.
WILLIAM: Why?
ANNA: Because my boyfriend, who I thought was in America, is in fact in the next room.
WILLIAM: Your boyfriend?
ANNA: Yes...
JEFF: Who is it?
WILLIAM: Ahm... room service.
JEFF: How you doing? I thought you guys all wore those penguin coats.
WILLIAM: Well, yes -- usually -- I'd just changed to go home -- but I thought I'd just deal with this final call.
JEFF: Oh great. Could you do me a favour and try to get us some really cold water up here?
WILLIAM: I'll see what I can do.
JEFF: Still, not sparkling.
WILLIAM: Absolutely. Ice cold still water.
JEFF: Unless it's illegal in the UK to serve liquids below room temperature: I don't want you going to jail just to satisfy my whims...
WILLIAM: No, I'm sure it'll be fine.
JEFF: And maybe you could just adios the dishes and empty the trash.
WILLIAM: Right.
ANNA: Really -- don't do that -- I'm sure this is not his job.
JEFF: I'm sorry. Is this a problem?
WILLIAM: Ah -- no. It's fine.
JEFF: What's your name?
WILLIAM: Ahm... Bernie.
JEFF: Thank you, Bernie. Hey -- nice surprise, or nasty surprise?
ANNA: Nice surprise.
JEFF: Liar. She hates surprises. What are you ordering?
