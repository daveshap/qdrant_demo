My story...
Hello, I've been lurking on this sub for a while I figured I'd share my story and maybe someone may find it a little helpful. 

In the summer of 2013 I was delivering pizzas with a BA in polisci/sociology. My gf (now wife) was bringing home about $400/wk and we were over $15k in CC debt. One day I was offered a job as a hospital security guard, full time pay plus (shitty) benefits so if course I accepted. The only catch was it was the overnight shift but what choice did I have? 

In a strange sort of coincidence, 1 month into that job my wife totaled her car (no injuries). It dawned on us then that with her working days and me on nights we didn't need 2 cars. Huge $$ saver!. 

5 months into the security job I applied for and got a job within that hospital on the adult psychiatry unit (night shift). The increase in pay was substantial and the benefits were SO GOOD that my wife and I got married A YEAR EARLY just so she could get on my benefits! That was 5 years ago and last week I was promoted, same hospital, still on the night shift and will be getting another substantial increase in pay.

We still only need 1 car, my wife has since changed careers and we had our 1st baby last March. $1000 in savings, some CC debt but just looking back it's crazy to see how things have changed. Going to night shift was very worrisome for me but it truly has been a life saver.
