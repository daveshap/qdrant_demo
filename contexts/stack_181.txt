How can I type in half-width number in Japanese Kana keyboard? I want to type in numbers on Japanese Kana input keyboard, but it needs alt key to type in numbers. For example, to type in 3, you must type in Alt + 3.However, this 3 is full-width, and it even does not go into the conversion list mode. So I found that it is not possible to type in the numbers in half-width.Is this possible in Japanese Kana keyboard?
