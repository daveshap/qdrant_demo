LENNY: Thanks for giving me a ride. I just have a few stops, mostly on the west side--
MACE: Whoa, whoa, whoa. I said I'd drop you home, but I'm not taking you on your sleazoid rounds. I've already pulled twelve hours today.
LENNY: Come on, Mace. This is gonna be a big night. Can't you feel it? The energy in the air? There's money to be made, dreams to sell.
MACE: Sleaze to peddle.
LENNY: Just a couple of hours. It'll be fun--
MACE: Excuse me. What part of NO don't you understand?
LENNY: Mace, you're my friend. I need you. Plus I'll give you 25% of what I make tonight.
MACE: Lenny, this may be a hard concept for you, but friends don't have to pay their friends.
MACE: Jeez, you're pathetic. Okay, I got a pickup at the St. James. I'll take you there, you can get a cab.
LENNY: Mace! You're a life-saver.
MACE: Driving Mr. Lenny.
MACE: So, what's up with you? Another busy night selling porno to wireheads?
LENNY: No, wrong... I sell experiences. Sex is only part of it.
MACE: Buncha techno-perv jerkoffs.
LENNY: Way I look at it, I actually perform a humanitarian service. I save lives.
MACE: Uh huh, I wanna hear this part.
LENNY: Okay, take some executive... bored with his life, bored with his wife... he picks up a hooker or some girl at a bar. Then he goes around for months, torn up worrying that he's got AIDS, that he'll infect his wife. And maybe he really does catch something--
MACE: Price he pays for being a scumsucking pig.
LENNY: Everybody needs to take a walk to the dark end of the street sometime, it's what we are. But now the risks are outa line. The streets are a war zone. And sex can kill you. So you slip on the trodes, you get what you need and it keeps you from jumping your tracks.
MACE: Lenny, this shit's illegal.
LENNY: Define illegal.
MACE: Me bailing your sorry pale ass out of jail twice in the last six months.
LENNY: Yeah, but that was for love.
MACE: Define love.
