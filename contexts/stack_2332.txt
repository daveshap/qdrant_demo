Why isn't my Minecraft detect command working when executed by a command block? I now have this command:<blockquote>  /execute @a ~ ~ ~ detect ~ ~-1 ~ minecraft:sandstone 0 effect @a[c=1] minecraft:slowness 2 1</blockquote>When I run this from the chat it works fine, it gives me slowness when I stand on sandstone and no slowness when I don't. but when I run this from a command block, it says<blockquote>  Failed to execute 'detect' as [my name]</blockquote>Why is this? Why won't my command work when executed by a command block?
