JORDAN: Your new roommate.
JORDAN: Anybody usin' these drawers here?
SLUTNIK: Hey, hey, HEY. No possibility. You can't stay in here. You can't sleep right next to me.
JORDAN: Funny, the C.O. says I can.
SLUTNIK: Aw, lookit this, lookit this -- she's bringin' Tampax in here. C'mon, you got nothin' but rooms over there.
JORDAN: That your desk? I'll take this one.
SLUTNIK: WOULD YOU JUST GET OUTTA HERE?
JORDAN: Listen, Sex Ape. I'm here to stay. And if you don't want me for a roommate or classmate, you got two options -- move out or ring out. End of file.
