JIMMY: Hey, Terry, guess who's here... that joker from the Commission... .
TERRY: Looking for me?
JIMMY: He's got his nerve, gum-shoeing around here after what you told him.
TERRY: Jimmy, suppose I knew something, say a mug somebody put on somebody... . You think I should turn him in?
JIMMY: A cheese-eater! You're kidding!
TERRY: Yeah, I'm kidding, I'm kidding. You don't think I should turn him in... .
JIMMY: You was a Golden Warrior.
TERRY: Yeah— us Golden Warriors. You're a good kid, Jimmy, a good tough kid. We stick together, huh, kid?
JIMMY: You was our first Supreme Commander, Terry. Keep out of sight and I'll tell him you're out.
TERRY: But I ain't out. I'm in. I'm in. Who's lying to who?
TERRY: You looking for me?
GLOVER: Not exactly. Just thought I'd sit down and rest my dogs a minute. You know the next investigation we get into I hope it's got buildings with elevators in them. This one has been nothing but climbing stairs. And when we hit the top ßoor the folks are usually out.
TERRY: I guess it's pretty tough work at that.
GLOVER: Well, it'll be worth it if we can tell the waterfront story the way the people have a right to hear it. Don't you think?
GLOVER: Didn't I see you fight in the Garden one night three or four years ago? With a fellow called Wilson?
TERRY: Wilson— yeah— yeah— I fought Wilson.
GLOVER: I thought you were going to take him that night but...
TERRY: You want to know something— I would have taken Wilson—
GLOVER: I think you could have.
TERRY: If I licked him I would have had the title shot instead of him— boy, I was ready that night.
GLOVER: You sure looked it. Something go wrong?
TERRY: Yeah. Johnny Friendly and my brother had other ideas.
GLOVER: Such as what?
TERRY: Listen, this ain't for publication.
GLOVER: I'm just resting my feet.
TERRY: Remember the first round how I had him against the ropes, and—
GLOVER: I'll never forget it. I thought it was all over.
TERRY: Yeah. My own blood— and they sell me out for a lousy bet— I had it in me to hit the top and— Boy, if I wanted to, the things I could tell you about them guys—
GLOVER: Yeah?
GLOVER: Well, I better get going. Hit those stairs again. Was that a looping right or an uppercut the first time you caught him?
TERRY: Looping right! I never swung wild. I was strictly a short puncher— hooks— over 'n under— — whop-whop!
GLOVER: Really?
TERRY: Yeah, really!
TERRY: Where you going? I'll walk along with you.
GLOVER: Sure... .
