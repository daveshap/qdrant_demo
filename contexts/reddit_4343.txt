It kills me to see others in worse positions than I am. You matter. You all matter and it doesn't matter what your depression or suicidal thoughts tell you.
I'm in a similar boat with all of you, but suicide isn't the way out, and self-harm doesn't help. Everyone I know who's self-harmed tell me not to do it. Your life matters. I know it doesn't seem like it does, I know you're being told something entirely the opposite, but theres always light at the end of the tunnel, no matter how long that tunnel is. It doesn't matter how many times you fail, what matters is if you give up on yourself. Please, you do, in fact, matter. You are, in fact, worth something. Hold onto whatever makes you wanna live, no matter how small or insignificant that thing might be, its still worth living for. If your family wouldn't care, if you don't have friends, if you feel as if not a single soul cares about what happens to you, at least know that I'd care. Alot of people I knew were depressed or suicidal, and things got better for them.

Please. Do SOMETHING. Go on a walk, for example. It doesn't have to be a big one, it could be just around the block or up and down your sidewalk. Or you could read a book, or do a small workout, etc. I know it seems pointless, but these things help improve your mood. I'm speaking from experience.

Eat something.  Don't starve yourself. It only worsens the pain.

You have to force yourself out of this. I know, all you feel like you're capable of doing is lying in bed, but it won't ever get better if you don't break the cycle. I know this seems like an impossible task, but do you really wanna wake up every morning wanting to die? I don't think any of us enjoy it. Do you really wanna die, or do you just want these thoughts and feelings to cease? Vent in the comments of this post if you want. I don't mind.

Talk to someone, anyone. You can even talk to me if you want to. Your life matters. Your feelings matter. Don't end it. Please. YOU MATTER.
