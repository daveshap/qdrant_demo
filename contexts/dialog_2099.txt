ELECTRA: What will you do if this works, if we get the money?
RATH: I don't know... maybe I'll live on a boat, sail to all the places I've never been.
ELECTRA: That sounds nice.
ELECTRA: I'm kind of tired. I think I'd like to try and get some sleep.
RATH: You can have the bed. The chair is fine for me.
