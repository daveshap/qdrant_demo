Is this typical practice of a recruiter?
Bear with me, I’m providing details for context. 

I interviewed with a company that I fell in love with last year. The hiring manager emailed me personally to tell me that I lost out to an internal candidate, but I’d be a great fit at the company, and she “strongly encouraged” me to keep applying, and that she would keep me in mind if a spot opened on her team. I kept applying with no luck, and sent her a follow up email months later restating my interest. 

Fast forward to 3 weeks ago. I get an email from her with a direct reply to my follow up email, telling me a spot opened on her team, and that I should apply and that she would flag my resume with internal corporate recruiter. I did, and he emailed me to schedule a phone interview. 

Had the phone interview last week, nailed it, and he told me that the hiring manager (not the director who emailed me, but the lead manager below her) might want to skip the phone interview with me and just bring me in, since his boss (that emailed me and whom I interviewed with last year) already tagged me, and I already interviewed with so many directors of departments that I would be interacting with last year. 

He told me (unprompted by me) that he was speaking with hiring manager on Friday, and that he would reach out to me either Friday or Monday the latest to let me know the interview schedule, as they are moving quickly.  I heard nothing, so yesterday morning I sent an email to follow up, asking for a status update. He never returned my email. 

It’s 2020. I have a computer on my wrist. I work at a big Corp and am also very busy with emails, meetings and life, but if I tell someone I will contact them, and they email me, I take the literal 2 seconds to respond and tell them if there’s a delay, someone is on vacation, whatever. 

Is this typical practice to ignore someone in a situation like this?  What should my next steps be?
