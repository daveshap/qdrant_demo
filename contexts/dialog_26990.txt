NICHOLAS: Hi. Didn't get a chance to say goodbye.
CHRISTINE: That's my fault. I get too worked up at these. I'm very method. You do know... that's not my name.
NICHOLAS: I didn't know what else to call you.
CHRISTINE: Claire.
NICHOLAS: Claire. Pleased to meet you.
CHRISTINE: I have to get to the airport...
NICHOLAS: Where are you going in such a hurry?
CHRISTINE: There's another gig starting in Saudi Arabia. I'm just a walk-on this time though. Bit-part.
NICHOLAS: What about dinner sometime, when you get back? Would that be... ?
CHRISTINE: Is this something you're interested in? I'm not really that person I was.
NICHOLAS: I realize. Maybe you could... tell me a little about yourself.
CHRISTINE: Like what... my favorite color... ?
NICHOLAS: Like... where are you from?
CHRISTINE: Originally, Connecticut.
NICHOLAS: Big family... small?
CHRISTINE: One brother, one sister.

NICHOLAS: Single?
CHRISTINE: Yes.
NICHOLAS: Boyfriend?
