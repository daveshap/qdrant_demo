What would be my concourse and gate number for departure? I have got my tickets. I am travelling from Auckland to Mumbai with a transit in Dubai. I have 4 hours of transit time. I will be coming by Emirates EK 449 and leaving on Emirates EK 506. I don't know the arrival gate and the departure gate. I only know that both will be in the same terminal, thats terminal 3.How large is this terminal and what is the maximum amount of time that it might take to get from one gate to another? Also, during the transit, is there a possibility that a bus/train needs to be taken?
