JIM: The U.S. is my jurisdiction.
MIGUELITO: Exactly! You are on foreign soil. You are a representative of the occupying forces. Or haven't you checked a map lately?!
MIGUELITO: These lands were taken by force from Mexico in the illegal War of American Aggression.
JIM: That would be... the Mexican War?
MIGUELITO: Call it what you like. The point is, I was heir to that land, Mr. West. It belonged to my beloved grandmother! Now I intend to have it back. My own country!
