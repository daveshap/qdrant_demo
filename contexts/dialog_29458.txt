RUIZ: You expect me to be grateful for spending the rest of my life looking over my shoulder.
GORDON: That thought makes me feel awful.
RUIZ: Can't you for a second imagine none of this had happened? That my drugs had gone through. What would have been the harm? A few people get high who are getting high anyway. Your partner is still alive. We avoid having breakfast together. Don't you see this means nothing? That your whole life is pointless?
GORDON: You're breaking my heart.
RUIZ: The worst thing about you, Monty, is you realize the futility of what you're doing and you do it anyway. I wish you could see how transparent you are. This food tastes like shit.
GORDON: So go shower already.
RUIZ: You only got to me because you were tipped off by the Juarez Cartel, who's trying to break into Tijuana. You're helping them. You work for a drug dealer too, Monty.
