GRUSINSKAYA: It is not stage fright -- it's something more --
PIMENOV: What -- what is it? Last night...
GRUSINSKAYA: Last night?... There was no applause.
PIMENOV: There was -- there was.
GRUSINSKAYA: That theatre -- half empty -- dancing for those few -- I was frantic -- I finished -- the last beat and... ...I waited -- I listened -- but the applause didn't come -- nothing. A man in the box -- and just the claques behind -- it is passed, Pimenov. We are dead -- it's finished.
