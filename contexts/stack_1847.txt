\"...the Black Camel will kneel at your door\" is a reference to time of death. What is the origin of this metaphor? I was reading the \"Life-Line\" by Robert Heinlein. His writing is beautifully decorated with allegories and metaphors and it is pretty obvious to me that he refers kneeling of black camel to imply the time of death in the below passage. <blockquote>  \"I will repeat my discovery. In simple language, I have invented a technique to tell how long a man will live. I can give you advance billing of the Angel of Death. I can tell you when the Black Camel will kneel at your door. In five minutes' time, with my apparatus, I can tell any of you how many grains of sand are still left in your hourglass.\"</blockquote>I did find another reference in a movie from 1931 with the name Black Camel.<blockquote>  Death is a black camel that kneels unbidden at every gate.</blockquote>Can someone help with the inception of this analogy or the associated symbolism--religious, literal or cultural?
