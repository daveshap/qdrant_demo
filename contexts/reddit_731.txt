Mother is in a “safety bubble” HELP
I’ll give some context, my father passed away from a hard childhood,  a distant and mentally ill father who never gave him the time of day or the rest of his siblings and he had no real childhood aside from finding any friend and a more self destructive behaviour. To make the long story short my father committed suicide the way he did it was the worst part, the gun cabinet opens the night before a day of work for him and I don’t know why, the next day he doesn’t come home, I don’t think anything of it I just stay quiet as it was late. After another day my mind went to the fucking worst, I couldn’t help but assume something terrible happened. The whole situation was fucked and there was no indication or note or goodbye, nothing to give closure or conclude anything, I went to bed arguing with him earlier, couldn’t even fucking say goodbye, my mom has had it rough for a while but recently in the last year she has taken it out in a “dictator” mindset and couldn’t be wrong or argued with, no rule needs explanation and all her “expectations” are completely fair. Some are completely normal but I had an argument with her and my vehicle being 3 weeks away from completion she forced me out of the house to the fastest apartment I could find and I can’t really work much without a vehicle, I have some anger issues and don’t react too calmly but she’s takes every criticism as “I don’t know anything, I guess I’m terrible, I can’t hear this anymore and walked away, she tends to just leave when it’s hard or true I don’t want to hurt my mom but nothing was stopping her from the unfair treatment of me and my sister and her instant critical tone to every conversation, like she expects me to wake up at the crack of dawn to be criticized, I lost motivation from a few things a while ago and have recovered on a steady rate but this keeps pulling me back to dark emotions, hate, fear, lack of empathy that it’s my mom, as in I can’t take being talked down to, I hear her and my sister having conversations regarding my “completely inappropriate” behaviour but in such a way none of my reason where at all legitimate, this is long but one more example for context, I had a bad fever, told her all day the day before and she still with some tone of i haven’t done shit wakes me up before I even got to pass out, I had so much trouble sleeping and I was 3 days with no sleep and she called my slight raised blood pressure and freak out insane basically, my sister and mom team up and I’m essentially alone in the situation of my vehicle being incomplete I just don’t want to hurt my family relationship by being there, she said she needs space but I can’t lose my mom and am I being cruel? I don’t want to be someone who doesn’t know the context of what they are saying
