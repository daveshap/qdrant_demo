BOYD: Okay. Here's the deal and it's a good one. Lois is cool. It's a pacified situation.
FISHER: What does that mean?
BOYD: I'm talking about Lois having relaxed her anxiety. Only deal is...you still got Micheal there?
FISHER: Yeah.
BOYD: Good deal. Lois just wants to hear it from Micheal.
FISHER: Hear what?
BOYD: That it was all an accident. She wants to hear it from Micheal's mouth.
FISHER: Now?
BOYD: That's right.
FISHER: Isn't it a little late?
BOYD: Hold on a sec. Lois, you sure you wouldn't rather do this in the morning?
