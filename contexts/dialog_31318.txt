LION: I haven't slept in weeks.
TIN MAN: Why don't you try counting sheep?
LION: That doesn't do any good -- I'm afraid of 'em.
SCARECROW: Oh, that's too bad. Don't you think the Wizard could help him, too?
DOROTHY: I don't see why not. Why don't you come along with us? We're on our way to see the Wizard now. To get him a heart.
TIN MAN: And him a brain.
DOROTHY: I'm sure he could give you some courage.
