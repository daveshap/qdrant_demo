I need help with life
I’m a high school freshman and I need help. I don’t want to come off as being whiny but I’m having struggles with school and family. At school I’m commonly referred or grouped with the edgy or emo kids. I don’t want to be in this group of people. I like the color black and I guess that is a problem for most others not sure why. I have a crush on this girl but I know she doesn’t like me back. The only times she has acknowledged me is just to say hi because she has to be my partner. The problem with my home life is that I was expected to even as little kid to be the saving grace of my family. I was supposed to be the smart one and pass all of school work with flying colors. My dad and mom are divorced and constantly trying to dish out dirt on each other. Another problem is that I have a very big anger problem it’s not uncontrollable it’s just that if I get mad enough I’ll start yelling and crying and punch shit until I calm down. My family thinks poorly of me because of it and my mother has told that one day when they were talking (my parents) my dad said that he was worried I was going to be a school shooter. I cried over that because I thought I knew my dad but I know he said that for a damn fact even if it was from my mom. I depresses me thinking about the different possibilities as to why people don’t like me or acknowledge me. My brother also hated my guts when we were kids and would constantly bully me and try to make me look bad in front of everyone that we knew. These things have gotten to me so much that the main reason I think people even try to be nice to me is because they think I’m going to shoot up the school and they don’t to be target caught in the crosshairs. Thank you if you read till the end I really need some help if you have anything that could help please let me know.
