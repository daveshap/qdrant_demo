My boring life
I thought I had everything.

I was the best.

Who wouldn't like a smart person kind enough to listen to everything you have to say. Always open to new information. Always wanting adventure and to learn something new. Patient enough to underatand your point of view. 

That was years ago.

This is today. I haven't slept in two days. I haven't had a good night of sleep in four years. My eyes are flooded with tears. I can't get out of bed to do anything. People scare me. I can't tell good from bad. 

I might delete this but I need to clear my head. You might ask yourself if i mistaken reddit for notepad. probabily. I don't know what I'm doing here.


I'm just a shell of what I was. What was once curiosity is now just static, ignoring everything that's outside of my body. I try to follow your words. I try to understand. I am tired. No one sees it. Nobody cares. I can't pull myself out. The advice I used to give turned to passive agresiveness and criticism. It's not my fault please understand. My love was meant to get the best flowers out of two seeds growing together. I became selfish. I still want the best for you but there's nothing good left in me. I want you to enjoy life. Can you even do it with me? Does wanting you closer make me selfish? I treated you so badly lately and I'm so painfuly sorry. I can't stop it. I'm scared to take meds. What if they kill me. I'm really paranoid. I need help. Who would help someone as evil as me. someone please force me into treatment if you love me so much. How do I know if the treatment will work. I'm going crazy. 


This is not who I am... or is it who I am now? 

I'm scared.
