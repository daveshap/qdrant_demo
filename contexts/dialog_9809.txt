CUMMINGS: Greetings, everyone.
FLETCH: Thank God, the police.
MR. STANWYK: What the hell are you doing here?
CUMMINGS: Put the gun down, Alan. I'll take care of them.
MRS. STANWYK: I thought you had this all figured out. Good going 'Irwin.'
FLETCH: Don't ever call me 'Irwin,' okay?
MR. STANWYK: I've got it all under control, Jerry. You can go now.
CUMMINGS: Under control? You idiot. You didn't know who he was?
CUMMINGS: Fat Sam left the beach today. So did Gummy. It began to occur to me that some things are beginning to happen that maybe I should be aware of.
MR. STANWYK: I said I'll take care of it. Now, a man of your position shouldn't be a part of what's about to go down. So go home and I'll call you tomorrow.
CUMMINGS: What, 'long distance?' I couldn't help but hear you say something about Rio, Alan. You're not leaving with the eight hundred thousand dollars I staked you for the next load, are you?
