MR. ARKY: You'd like to see a nuclear holocaust?
MARTY: Not a holocaust --
MR. ARKY: Mr. McFly here wants to nuke it all, just so he can see it!
MARTY: You know damn well that's not what I meant.
MR. ARKY: All I can say is, that's one helluva attitude, Mr. McFly. 'Let's explode a hundred megaton Geothermal nuclear device, just to see it.'
MARTY: Yeah, explode it up your ass!
MR. ARKY: Unfortunately, the way things are going, you may get your wish. You may see the entire annhiliation of the world. If not, you'll certainly see the destruction of all out natural resources. We can already see the air we breathe, not to mention the pollution in our rivers and lakes. We'll see all of our oil reserves depleted, in fact, all of our energy sources. Yes, you people have a lot to look forward to -- a lot to see.
MARTY: Hey, Mr. Arky, gimme a break! I'm seventeen years old! I'm not responsible for all these problems!
