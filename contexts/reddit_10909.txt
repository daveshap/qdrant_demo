Today I threw away my rope
Throwaway since I don't really want this on my main account and I'm not sure if it belongs here. I wrote my suicide note yesterday and attempted suicide. I won't bore you with the details of that but it didn't work, don't think I did it right. This morning, I took my rope that I have (the only rope I had, specifically for that purpose) and I threw it in the trash. I ripped up my suicide note. I've told myself that I'm going to stay here and fight, even if I don't win, I'm going to give it a damn good go. 

It might seem rather insignificant, but throwing that rope away, the rope that was always there for me to use if I felt like it, is a big step for me.
