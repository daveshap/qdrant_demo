DR. DREYFUSS: She'll sleep on and off for the next twenty-four hours. Of course, she'll have a dandy hangover when she wakes up --
BUD: Just as long as she's okay.
DR. DREYFUSS: These cases are harder on the doctor than on the patient. I ought to charge you by the mile.
DR. DREYFUSS: Any of that coffee left?
BUD: Sure.
DR. DREYFUSS: How do you spell her last name?
BUD: Kubelik -- with two k's.
DR. DREYFUSS: What's her address? Where does she live?
BUD: Why do you want to know, Doc? You don't have to report this, do you?
DR. DREYFUSS: It's regulations.
BUD: She didn't mean it, Doc -- it was an accident -- she had a little too much to drink and -- she didn't know what she was doing -- there was no suicide note or anything -- believe me, Doc, I'm not thinking about myself --
DR. DREYFUSS: Aren't you?
BUD: It's just that she's got a family -- and there's the people in the office -- look, Doc, can't you forget you're a doctor -- let's just say you're here as a neighbor --
DR. DREYFUSS: Well, as a doctor, I guess I can't prove it wasn't an accident. But as your neighbor, I'd like to kick your keester clear around the block. Mind if I cool this off?
BUD: Help yourself.
DR. DREYFUSS: I don't know what you did to that girl in there -- and don't tell me -- but it was bound to happen, the way you carry on. Live now, pay later. Diner's Club! Why don't you grow up, Baxter? Be a mensch! You know what that means?
BUD: I'm not sure.
DR. DREYFUSS: A mansch -- a human being! So you got off easy this time -- so you were lucky --
BUD: Yeah, wasn't I?
DR. DREYFUSS: But you're not out of the woods yet, Baxter -- because most of them try it again! You know where I am if you need me.
