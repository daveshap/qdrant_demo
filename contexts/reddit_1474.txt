I may have just quit my job.
I’m not sure. I did walk out. 

Manager came down today because employee A and B were fighting. Instead of speaking to anyone she stopped in front of me and Screamed about how everyone is going to cut the shit and she’s not dealing with it.  The. She screamed some more about us listening to her and stormed out. 

I’ve been having a panic attack since. I just went to talk to her to tell her I needed to leave and she started right back at yelling. 

So I snapped and told her that this was an unacceptable way to speak to employees, that I was leaving and I might be back on Monday if I want to continue being verbally abused. 

Then I texted the manager, who of course wasn’t there, and told her I need to speak to her before I return. Because of this is an acceptable way of dealing with employees I won’t be back. 

So I think I quit my job. And I’m still sobbing and shaking, 4 hours after the attack started.

EDIT: Thank you all so much. I did not expect the outpouring of support, and I cannot tell you all how much it means to me!
