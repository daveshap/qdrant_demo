RICHARD: What time is it?
FRANCESCA: Later. Go back to sleep.
RICHARD: Where you going?
FRANCESCA: I'm not tired. I thought I might finish Carolyn's skirt.
RICHARD: Now?! It's after eleven.
FRANCESCA: I can't sleep.
RICHARD: Again? Maybe you should see a doctor.
FRANCESCA: I'm not sick, Richard. I'm just not tired, now go back to sleep before you're up for the whole night too!
