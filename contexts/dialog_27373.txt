JACKIE: What?
STARKS: When we first met, when you were 7, where was the house you lived in with your mother? Do you remember your address?
JACKIE: 112 Orchard Way. [Realizing, in a whisper] You're not coming back, are you?
STARKS: You gotta stop thinking like that.
JACKIE: Then, where are you going?
STARKS: Nowhere. [Beat] I just think I'm gonna be sick.
