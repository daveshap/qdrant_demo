To everyone who applied ED to the same school as me...
Genuinely, from the bottom of my heart: I hope you get in.

College admissions has turned into such a cutthroat affair. And I get it, to some extent, because I can understand the near desperation of wanting to attend your dream school. But I don't want this whole process to turn us into enemies. We're in this together.

We've all come this far. We all DESERVE to get in. I know that everyone's situation is different. We have different test scores and GPAs, different ECs, different financial situations; some of us have struggled quietly with mental illness and burnout while others have faced tough living situations and environments. Yet what unites us is that we've all done the same thing: worked our absolute hardest to get where we are now, to finish our applications, and to send them in. 

A lot of us will get rejected. But it's not because any one of us is better or worse than the other-- we all have our stories to tell, our scars to show, and stats alone can't possibly define us. It's just how it is with a competitive school! 

I'm prepared to not get in. I know I'd be happy at any of the other schools I've applied to. But I'm hoping and dreaming, and I'm doing the same for every single one of you! 

So in this time of stress and waiting, and the waiting joy and tears at the end of the line, know that I'm proud of all of us. We've gotten this far! And we'll continue to go far, no matter where we go. But let's hope it's to our dream school.

Love you all! We got this.

(Edited for typos, like all our apps hopefully!)
(Edit2 to add: I'm also rooting for everyone applying to other schools, of course ;D)
