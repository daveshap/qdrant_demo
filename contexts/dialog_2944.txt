BASQUIAT: She loves me. Oh yeah she loves me! She loooooooves me
BENNY: Would you shut the fuck up? You hear what I'm doing?
BASQUIAT: Yeah man. I'm jealous. You're always great, Benny. Her name is G-I-N-A Gina And she lo-oooves me." I did say chicken!"
BASQUIAT: I knew I left these somewhere. One of these'll send your kids to college someday. Here – I made this for you.
BENNY: Thanks. Your dad called again – something about a job.
BENNY: You got a date already?
BASQUIAT: We're getting married. She said she could tell I was a great artist – she could see it in my eyes. She said she wanted to be by my side and have inter-racial babies with me.
