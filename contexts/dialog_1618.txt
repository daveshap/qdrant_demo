ALVY: What is this? What are you, since when do you read the National Review"? What are you turning in to?"
ANNIE: Well, I like to try to get all points of view.
ALVY: It's wonderful. Then why don'tcha get William F. Buckley to kill the spider?
ANNIE: Alvy, you're a little hostile, you know that? Not only that, you look thin and tired.
ALVY: Well, I was in be- It's three o'clock in the morning. You, uh, you got me outta bed, I ran over here, I couldn't get a taxi cab. You said it was an emergency, and I didn't ge- I ran up the stairs. Hell - I was a lot more attractive when the evening began. Look, uh, tell- Whatta you- Are you going with a right-wing rock-and- roll star? Is that possible?
ANNIE: Would you like a glass of chocolate milk?

ANNIE: I got the good chocolate, Alvy.
ALVY: Yeah, where is the spider?
ANNIE: It really is lovely. It's in the bathroom.
ALVY: Is he in the bathroom?
ANNIE: Hey, don't squish it, and after it's dead, flush it down the toilet, okay? And flush it a couple o' times.
ALVY: Darling, darling, I've been killing spiders since I was thirty, okay?
ANNIE: Oh. What?
ALVY: Very big spider.
ANNIE: Yeah?
ALVY: Two... Yeah. Lotta, lotta trouble. There's two of 'em.
ANNIE: Two?
ALVY: Yep. I didn't think it was that big, but it's a major spider. You got a broom or something with a-

ALVY: Okay, let me have this.
ANNIE: Well, what are you doing... what are you doing with-
