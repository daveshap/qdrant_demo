Receding Hairline (male)
Hey reddit

I'm a 20 year old male and I'm slowly losing my hair like millions of other people on the planet and it's bothering me unreasonably.

It almost bothers me more that I am complaining about such a petty matter with so many more important problems in the world. Or the fact that many others have it far worse than I do at yet here *I* am whining!

That's all, just felt like complaining to someone :)
