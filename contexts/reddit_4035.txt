Guys who were late bloomers, how did you manage to get your first date/kiss?
22 year old virgin guy here, never been on a date. I've tried every dating site under the sun but never got any matches or replies. Been clubbing numerous times but no girls were interested. When I was at college I joined the drama club to get out of my comfort zone and perhaps meet some like minded women. Made guy friends but women just weren't interested in me. 

Any other guys who were in my position? How did you change it?
