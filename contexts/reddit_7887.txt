What is the hottest topic in dermatology research now?
Hi. I'm about to choose which direction I should work on in dermatology, which I'm passionate about. The current options are skin regeneration, GVHD & skin inflammatory response, and melanoma. They all sound very interesting to me, but is there nay insider that can provide some suggestions on which one is the hottest topic? And also, which topic is more industry-oriented? Thanks!
