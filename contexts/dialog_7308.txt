LINDA: I thought... Oh, Nick, I thought you were hurt, some accident. Maybe you fell or maybe some car... I thought someone stole you away!
NICK: No.
LINDA: Oh, Nick! Oh I missed you so!
LINDA: How are you?
NICK: Fine. I'm fine. How are you?
LINDA: Fine. I just go along, you know. Down at the market. Back here. I mean it just seems there's a million things to do!... Are you sure you're all right? I mean, what about the wound?
NICK: That was nothing. That wasn't anything.
LINDA: But --
NICK: It was just the complications. I mean, you take a little thing over there and then you get complications. I mean all the guys had it.
LINDA: I made you a sweater. Here... You have to take that off.
