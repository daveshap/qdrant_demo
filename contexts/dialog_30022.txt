JAKE: You'd tell me anything to save your pathetic life.
BOBBY: You know what kind of woman Grace is, Jake. You know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of Superior. What's she to you, Jake; a woman who wants you dead? Let me kill her. All I want is two-hundred dollars to get out of here with.
JAKE: Two-hundred dollars?
BOBBY: Two-hundred dollars...I'll do it! I'll kill her!
