Company went ghosting on me after job offer. Tomorrow is the “start date”. What should I do?
Hello, 

I’m just writing because I find myself in a really weird situation. A month ago I interview at the BBC for a really good job  (35k£ entry level) 

After a week I receive a phone call from one of the recruiters saying I had gotten the job and she would later send me all the information via e-mail. During the phone call she did say who my manager would be as well as the starting date.

After that nothing.


It has been two weeks now and I have kept chasing this recruiter for an official letter/confirmation but I got nothing. A couple of days ago I have also called the main office and was told by a Manager that he would make sure the material got to me by the end of the day but I got nothing from that too.

Tomorrow is the day I am supposed to start (at least based on what the recruiter said).

What should I do? 

At the moment the only idea is to show up at the reception and see what happens because I don’t know what to think anymore.

Don’t know if any of you had ever been in a similar situation. 

UPDATE:

Showed up at the office today and they were expecting me. Induction day today. Thanks everyone!
