My school just banned dating
My school decided to "ban" dating. Like, how the hell can they do that? Sure, they have caused some issues like last monday, 2 students were caught going at it in the biology classroom. Talk about studying human biology. A bit weird to do that in school but ok whatever. This week my school also found out that one of the teachers had sexted with one of the students. Those are pretty messed up but not allowing students to date each other as a result? That is truly annoying and makes me furious

I fucking hate my school. Anyone else being homeschooled? 

Edit: So the Principal just fired the teacher who was caught sexting. Situation evolves it seems
