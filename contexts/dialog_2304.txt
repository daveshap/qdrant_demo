EMMA: But you did suspect me.
STEED: Not for a moment.
EMMA: You're playing games.
STEED: Aren't we all, Mrs. Peel?
EMMA: I thought you played by the rules.
STEED: I thought you didn't.
EMMA: I'm playing to win.
STEED: Winning isn't everything.
EMMA: Please don't tell me it's how you play the game.
STEED: After you -- Mrs. Peel ...
EMMA: No, after you.
STEED: You don't trust me?
EMMA: As far as you trust me.
