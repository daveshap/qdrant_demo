After two months I landed my dream job - advice and thoughts
Hello,

I'm a recent graduate from a top university in the UK. For years I have wanted to break into investment banking on the markets side of things (sales/trading) but without any direct past finance experience it was an uphill battle.

I've sent hundreds of linkedin messages, written over 80 specific cover letters and revised my CV countless times. I recently just passed the first and second final round interviews and was offered a position on a 2015 graduate scheme in markets.

This sub has been helpful to me and I hope others can benefit from my experiences. Note that this is probably most apt for people looking at landing their first graduate job.

**Get Passionate**
- Whilst passion doesn't come across easily on paper, particularly when applying for conservative fields, it stands out at interview. I am passionate about the bank I am joining and the direction of its markets business - I made sure that this genuine enthusiasm and energy came across face to face.

**Network**
- The benefits of networking need not be stated but honestly this helped me so much. I found it was less about the ability of your network to refer you to HR or offer you a job, but the insight they provided in the industry and advice such as how to approach interviews and what to read.

Furthermore in your professional career networking is not an additional task - it is fundamental to every business relationship. It's about developing rapport, knowledge, lingo, confidence and more.

**Knowledge**
- So I didn't have any prior financial work experience/internships whereas some of the other applicants had numerous finance internships. Knowing this limitation I made sure to work harder when it came to my own reading. I studied technical textbooks for days on end so that my knowledge would be at least equal, if not greater than, the other more experienced applicants. In my final interview I was sat across a technical chap who outright stated that the technical book I cited as reading was "his favorite book".

**Leverage**
- I leveraged my previous experience in a non-related field to demonstrate the qualities required for the role. You have to know what the role demands and then understand how you fit in. Don't be afraid to bring up non-related experience, just frame it correctly and confidently. If anything I used this as my point of difference, arguing the unique perspective I could bring.

**Refine** 
- When I first started writing applications I thought I had a killer template. By the end of writing applications I cringed when reading my first drafts. There's always so much room for improvement. If I were to do it again I would have spent longer on refining my early applications instead of a trial-by-fire approach.

**Competency Questions**
- So yeah, they are awful. Truth is though they are a sort of shit-test so you can demonstrate the effort you are willing to put in to get the job. In almost all careers you're going to have to do things you might not want to do, by answering competencies well you can tick this box.    

I'd like to note in my final round interview I was asked a few "standard" competency questions, I felt I developed really good rapport with the interviewers and went slightly off script. I told them an answer which sort-of, but not wholly, fit the criteria they asked. I then directly told them "I know that doesn't perfectly answer your question, but I think that this question is really about my ability to X, in that case I have proven that by doing Y & Z."

**Final Thoughts**
- I was frequently told by both family and strangers that "something would come through" and whilst I'm not usually one for banal platitudes there is an element of truth. It is possible that after all my hard work I could still have fallen short and not been successful, in that case I'd have widened my net and gone to plan B. However the important thing is to truly commit to your efforts, don't short change yourself and slack, if you can go the extra mile in technical reading/networking then do it - even if it's not successful it's giving you skills, determination and strength of character which will help you in the future.

Wishing you all the very best.
