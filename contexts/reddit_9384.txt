Are you the poorest relative in the Family?
I am. 

I feel like such a f-up. 

Just found out two of my kids might be getting married soon and I have nothing to give, financially, to the impending festivities. 

I didn't want my life to turn out this way. I am educated - I haz degrees - but degrees don't inspire anyone to hire me. 

In MY area I've even read of computer science majors looking for jobs for months. 

When you're the poorest one in the family, it brings a lot of shame.
