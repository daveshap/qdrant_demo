Cannot escape feelings of isolation
I have been recently through a period of clinical diagnosed depression, not sure if it is still here but I admit I am doing a lot better than last year 

However, these days most of my thoughts are on why am I so lonely, how can I be not so alone and it is taking over all my thoughts

I have friends, not many but they are there, scattered around my university and home city

But I really really desire a group of good friends that I can be around everyday, I feel so lame and boring going through everyday hanging around the same people and I hate how I don't know how to change it. I want to have all theses adventures and make the best of my university life, but most of my friends are also suffering from their own issues. I feel trapped in a routine. 

Is there a way for me to meet new people, and eventually a group of good friends or is that near impossible? i so am awkward and antsy and it is hard to to out there to find people
