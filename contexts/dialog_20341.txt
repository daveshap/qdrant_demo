THE MUMMY: Have we in some way made you angry, Master?
CRISWELL: You know better than that.
THE MUMMY: We don't know of anything, Master...
CRISWELL: Then why do you shake so?
THE MUMMY: It's not often an Emperor like <i>you</i> calls on creatures like us.
CRISWELL: Well rest easy, I'm not angry with either of you.
THE MUMMY: Aaaahhhh.
THE MUMMY: Then it is some service you desire of us.
CRISWELL: You are the keepers of the Damned. You two know them all. And I am tired of this usual type of entertainment. I want...a decided change.
