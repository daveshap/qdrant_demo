MAJOR KONG: Who's that?
LT. ZOGG: It's me - Lothar. Are you okay?
MAJOR KONG: I'm okay. What's up?
LT. ZOGG: Well, I hate to say this, but I think the bomb bay doors are stuck.
MAJOR KONG: Are you sure?
LT. ZOGG: Well, I can't get out and look, King. But I don't get a green light.
MAJOR KONG: Maybe the warning system's out.
LT. ZOGG: But I get a red light.
MAJOR KONG: Have you tried the emergency system?
LT. ZOGG: I tried everything. Something must have gotten bent or twisted from the pounding we took.
MAJOR KONG: Lothar, can you arm the bombs for impact?
LT. ZOGG: But I TOLD YOU, I don't think we can get the bomb bay doors open.
MAJOR KONG: I asked you a question, Lothar!
LT. ZOGG: But how are we going to drop the bombs if the doors won't --- Hey, King....you're not thinking of --- You don't mean you'd --- ???
MAJOR KONG: There's no other way, Lothar. Can you re-arm the bombs for impact?
LT. ZOGG: Let me check.
MAJOR KONG: There's no other way, boys. I'm going to have to take her in...the hard way.
