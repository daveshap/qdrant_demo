Rescinded job offer regrets
Hi all,

In August, I ended up rescinding a job offer which I now think I should have accepted. Some background knowledge: I'm a relatively new professional and have been at my current institution for a year and a half. Our institution went through some restructuring, causing a lot of us to look at other positions (four of my coworkers left). I interviewed for a great job back in my hometown that would have afforded me more money, being near my family, and an opportunity to work at a larger institution. I struggled for weeks to decide whether or not I wanted to accept the offer, and after I did, I felt regretful because I'd grown attached to the people at my current job/friends I'd made here. I ended up rescinding the offer in favor of my personal development. Now, however, I feel a bit stunted and feel like I made a mistake professionally/personally. 

My question is, while I know they've filled the position I rescinded and it would be silly to come groveling back, I don't want to be blacklisted from that institution/department. I worked for them in grad school and had built a strong relationship with them, but now I fear I ruined that relationship by accepting then rescinding the offer. 

Is it too late to reach out to them to apologize and explain my mindset to them? How can I work on repairing that relationship in order to potentially have the opportunity to work there in the future? I understand that I have to stay the course at my current job because that's the choice I made, and I'll put my heart and soul into that. But have any of you ever worked at an institution to which you originally said no? 

Thank you in advance!
