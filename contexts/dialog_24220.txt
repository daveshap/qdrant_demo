KATRINA: Lay still, Ichabod. Do not move.
LADY VAN TASSEL: Doctor, he is awake.
ICHABOD: What... what are you doing... ?
KATRINA: I'm drawing bad blood from the wound.
DOCTOR LANCASTER: Keep still, Constable. You were half-drowned when they found you.
ICHABOD: ... Brom Bones...
DOCTOR LANCASTER: He is dead. You would be also, if your wound had not somehow shut.
ICHABOD: Bring Young Masbath here.
DOCTOR LANCASTER: You need to sleep.
ICHABOD: Bring him.
DOCTOR LANCASTER: You need rest.
YOUNG MASBATH: Someone left last night. Looked like they headed to the square, but I lost them in the forest.
ICHABOD: Man or woman?
YOUNG MASBATH: All I saw was their lantern.
ICHABOD: Business, best hidden is hidden best at night.
YOUNG MASBATH: If someone has the Horseman's skull... if they control the Horseman, then why haven't they sent him for your head yet?
ICHABOD: Because, I serve a fine purpose alive. It is perfection for our murderer if I return to New York City with nothing more than tales of a galloping ghoul. We must uncover the reason these victims were targeted. What was taken from them... other than their lives? Who benefits by their deaths?
