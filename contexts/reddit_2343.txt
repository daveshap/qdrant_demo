As the Ivy Day approaches...
It easy for our friends, parents, relatives, and others to form an opinion of us based on the colleges that we get into. But, for us, it is important to remember that "opinion" is a just a social construct; its made-up, its not necessarily your reality. And ***"Someone's opinion of you does not have to become your reality."*** **(Les Brown)** Be it your haters or your very loved ones. Only you and you should define yourself.

It great if you get into those IVY leagues, Stanford, Caltech, MIT, or the reputed T20s. You sure have a kickstart to your professional life with the networks you will create and the opportunities you will take advantage of. Be happy and rejoice, you deserve it. However, to think that this success makes you superior to your peers who didn't get into these colleges is outrightly incorrect. Sometimes, we adopt such a thinking unconsciously; like we start treating ourselves differently if we get into a great college and vice-versa. (I've seen it with a couple of my friends) Does a college decision determine how "able" we are/were? No. Do rejections discount the hard-work we put into our exams, classes, ECs, and essays? No. Does an acceptance somehow enhance "the road that we have already traversed"? No. They, why do we let ourselves affected by them so much? Sure, an acceptance could give us validation for the work that we have done. But, if validation is all what you seek, don't forget that "college decisions" are not the only way.

If you are doing good work, putting in "those extra hours of hardwork outside your comfort zones", and heading towards your dreams slowly but persistently, you are sure to get tons of "validations" in future. You will get medals, your work will be published in reputed journals, and you will eventually get  recognitions for the work you do. Just be unstoppable. And, as Steve Jobs said *"Believe that the dots will somehow connect in the future. Because believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to keep working, even when it leads you off the well worn path."*

**Don't put so much weight on the decision part.** It sure is difficult, but this mental detachment is essential for you to keep moving forward. If you get acceptances, don't just start assuming that you will do well with everything you do in future. If you get rejections, don't behave as if you've lost on everything, and all the work that you have done means nothing. Learn what went wrong with you and what went right. And keeping working.

Also, remember that the admission officer that judges you is not the wisest man/woman on earth. He/she could have had prejudices and your decision is of-course dependent on uncountable unpredictable factors. Don't let him/her take control of the "most defining moment of your life". What I mean to say is that don't think of an admission decision as the "most defining moment". You were born to do greater things than just getting into good colleges. Take that burden off your shoulders. Breath in. Breath out. And focus on the longer journey.

Hope things work in your favour but more importantly, I hope you keep working on your dreams irrespective of these admission outcomes are.
