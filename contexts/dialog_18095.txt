SWANBECK: - good. Then if you manage to get hold of Ambrose, and obtain what he's got, you've got - - 8 hours 57 minutes and twenty-three seconds to destroy the largest remaining source of Chimera on earth.
ETHAN: She sacrificed herself..
SWANBECK: Brave girl. If you can get hold of Bellerophon with the time limit, you may spare her the ultimate sacrifice. But in either case you've got less than nine hours to kill her or cure her. After that it's out of our hands and a matter of worldwide material law. And Hunt. However you obtain it, we want you to preserve a sample of Chimera. Bring it back alive.
SWANBECK: Something else?
ETHAN: Aren't you even curious? About why she did it?
SWANBECK: No. I can't afford to be curious. And neither can you, Hunt..
AMBROSE: Feel like pleading for your life?
NYAH: Not as much as you feel like hearing it.
AMBROSE: God damn it, Nyah! Why did you do it? Why did you save that bastard?
NYAH: If it'll make you feel any better I won't do it again.
AMBROSE: If it'll make you feel any better, you're going to take a lot of Aussies with you and make me a lot of money.
NYAH: What are you talking about?
AMBROSE: In just a few hours you can be assured of going down in history as the typhoid Mary of Oz. G'day.
