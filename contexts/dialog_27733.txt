MRS. MARSH: I'm sorry, Doctor. Georgina's a good child -- a brave child -- you saw how she was during the operation -- but if she can't move, she can't move.
MACFARLANE: But she must be able to move. Everything is in place.
MRS. MARSH: She would if she could.
MACFARLANE: Then all my surgery is no good. There's something wrong with the child -- something I don't know -- something I can't define -- can't diagnose. I can do nothing for her.
