LUKE: Who's the pilot?
HAN: It's automatic.
LUKE: Let him have it. You're winning anyway. It doesn't make any difference.
THREEPIO: I know, sir, but it's the principle of the thing.
LUKE: Are you sure you don't need it?
BEN: I rarely use it any more. I have the Force. The Force is more powerful than any pistol. You shouldn't put too much faith in that weapon. Work on becoming aware of the Force... learn to feel its presence within you. Try to sense what it's telling you. It's the only thing you can rely on.
LUKE: What do I do?
BEN: All you have to do is lose your thinking self. Don't focus on anything. Let your body do your thinking... You have to learn to act on what you feel, not what you think ... If I had the crystal, it would be much easier. You could feel the Force immediately... but for now, let yourself go. You'll pick it up... and someday you'll have no need for that pistol either.
HAN: I'd keep that thing close just in case, if I were you... I've been around from one end of the galaxy to the other and believe me this Force of Others stuff may make for good religion, but there is no substitute for a good weapon at your side.
LUKE: You don't believe in the Force?
HAN: Sorcery! I believe in myself... I determine my destiny, not some mystical energy field.
BEN: Well, we'll see...
HAN: You might get your stuff together. We'll be coming up on Organa Major soon.
