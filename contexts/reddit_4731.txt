Ex GF was my life, now what's the point?
  

I posted my story on another sub for some support. Feel free to read it…it’s long. I am just feeling very depressed today. "Depressed" being an understatement. She was my world. We were going to get married and have a life together. Had our kids name picked out. She told me she couldn’t imagine her life without me. Now she’s posting pictures with the guy she cheated on me and left me for saying how amazing he is. He’s a loser, no job, no education, can’t support her. I would have given her the world. She threw away 7 years together and all our love and memories for a guy she had only known for a few weeks. It kills me.

She doesn’t love me. She’ll never come back to me. What’s the point anymore? I don’t care about having a good job or having “a lot going for me”. The one thing I want in life I can’t have. Her. She was my everything. I don’t want someone else. I literally don’t care about anything in my life anymore. I hate everything. I hate myself. I lost her. I treated her so well but it just wasn’t enough. And now she’s gone. I don’t know what to do. I just wake up, go to work, go to the gym, go to bed and repeat. Every day is the same and my partner is now happy with someone else. What am I supposed to do? I feel broken. Thanks in advance.
