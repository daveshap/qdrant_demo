ZED: How'd you know?
KAY: Just a guess. But I think found a nest.
LAUREL: I swear to God, that was not here two days ago...
JAY: What is it?
LAUREL: It's the most amazing insect nest I've ever seen. And I'll tell you one thing, it sure as hell ain't the Andean Mollatoosa.
JAY: But it's definitely a nest, isn't it?
LAUREL: Man, hey-- maybe you are an entopologist after all.
