M.Ed in Higher Ed or MPA with Higher Ed specialization?
Hello, everyone. I’m looking to go back to school to get my masters. I graduated with a BSN in 2018 and currently work as a nurse. My heart isn’t in this profession and I’ve wanted to get into student affairs/higher ed admit for a long time.

I have about 4yr experience working part-time at a registrar office during college and extensively helped students with enrollment questions and issues, and at one point was part of the scheduling and curriculum department as a sort of front desk/admin asst. I’ve also been a substitute teacher for roughly 2yr mainly working with highschool students. 

I’ve had a handful of friends/coworkers/supervisors that have MPAs and are in jobs I feel I would really enjoy, mainly all in enrollment and curriculum. I particularly am interested in the advising or admin side. I’m not sure if getting an MPA or a M.Ed would be better to start a career in student affairs (there are no M.Ed in student affairs/higher ed admin at colleges I am considering). Are there some ways to dip my toes in before even getting a masters, even though my bachelor’s and most recent work experience is in a very different field?

(Sorry is this sounds dumb. Please lmk if there are other subreddits more suitable to post this question! I’ve only really seriously considered a career in higher ed in the past few months and don’t really know where to start. Thanks for reading my text wall if you’ve got this far! ❤️)
