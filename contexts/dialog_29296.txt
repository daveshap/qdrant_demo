QUAID: What do you want?
CALLER: They've got you bugged, and they'll be busting down the door in about three minutes unless you do exactly what I say.
CALLER: Don't bother looking. It's in your skull.
QUAID: Who are you?
CALLER: Never mind. Wet a towel and wrap it around your head. That'll muffle the signal.
QUAID: How'd you find me?
CALLER: I'd advise you to hurry.
