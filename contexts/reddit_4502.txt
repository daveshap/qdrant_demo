Fantasy brings me much more pleasure than reality, so how can I enjoy life again?
I've been struggling with depression for +10 years, and I'm at a point where I'm ready to just throw my hands up, and give up trying to find joy in the real world anymore. I've always turned to some form of escapism as a coping strategy, whether it's gaming, cartoons, or even just watching random YT videos. Now, I feel like I would just be happier if I could live in that escapism all the time. If there was a way I could just spend my life sleeping and dreaming all the time, I would.

Even my therapist has acknowledged that life won't be as much fun as living in a gaming world or watching cartoons, so what's the point? So far, the main answer seems to be "you just have to do it." I don't wanna die, but I don't wanna live either. I'm convinced nothing would make me happier than if I were to live in my own head.

Edit: I’m also on the autism spectrum, so I’ve always had a harder time making friends, and interacting with people.
