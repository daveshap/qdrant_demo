18, and forced to wear the hijab since I was 12, idk what to do anymore.
So when I was about 12 I put on the hijab by house because I wanted to make my parents happy. A few months later I regretted it and told them I wanted to remove it. They wouldn’t let me and threatened me their 12 year old daughter to be homeschooled or to go live in a Muslim third world country. Since I’m very passionate about my education I left it on but removed at school through out middle school. Starting high school I left it on because I didn’t want to go through the drama of being caught without it and stuff again. I’m 18 and still in high school. Universities choices are coming up, my parents want me to go to a university close to them and of course never move out “Because that’s not allowed in Islam you should always have a male guardian”. I’m sick of their religious bullshit, they love more than anything and they think they are doing the best for me but I’m not even Muslim anymore. Idk what to do right now. So the real question is do I choose my happiness of theirs? Since bought cannot co-exist knowing that they love me and sacrificed their lives to sent me to the best schools etc..
