I want to be ok on my own, but it feels impossible when I long for romance and love
This feeling comes in waves. Some days, I’m happy with being single and enjoy the time to myself but on days like today, I feel completely miserable knowing that I am worthy of love but can’t have it. All I have ever wanted ever since I was a little girl was to love someone and be loved in return. I’ve always been a hopeless romantic and was an amazing girlfriend to my ex but he wasnt to me; not even close. I’m just so depressed with how awful most of the guys I’ve been with are. I’m torn between believing dating is hopeless, yet I remain hopeful that I’ll meet the right person and keep this idealized vision of the man I want in my head and tell myself that he exists. All I think about lately is this man of my dreams whom I’ve never met. It just hurts to not have that right now when I know I am more than enough.

Other days, I just want nothing to do with men and constantly lurk on this sub for hours at a time. It’s like I’m trying to convince myself that I don’t want a man, when truthfully, I do. Either the guy I want is super attractive and a jerk, semi-attractive but a player, or average with mental illnesses (my ex-anger issues and violent tendencies). Probably dramatic, but these have been my personal experiences. Maybe part of it too is that I was with a toxic person for so many years and I just want someone who’s actually good for me.

How the hell can you be ok on your own when you’re a hopeless romantic who feels like they deserve a good guy?

**Update: Wow, you guys... I am in straight awe by the outpour of your responses and just want to thank all of you for taking the time to give me your support and sharing your stories. I have read every single post and am blown away. You've given me faith that hope is not lost and it can happen. There IS someone out there for me, and there's someone out there for you too. Like someone else said, the good ones get snatched up in the dating pool while the bad ones stay, and the dating scenes I approach like dating apps and bars do not attract the right men.** 

**Sometimes my mind spirals and I feel very caught up in the fantasy of love that I crave with someone. I had no idea anyone else out there felt this way too and honestly thought I was an outlier in my generation because no one my age talks about this. To the people who think I am needy for desiring a man, I actually do enjoy being single and feel liberated by how much it has allowed me to accomplish-I know I don't need a man but I do want love. I prefer being single over my previous relationship by a landslide. Thank you for ensuring me that this feeling is human and that there is hope out there. I really needed this today. <3**
