ROB: Hey Monty--you think we'll get any business today?
MONTY: I'm handing out a free lei to every customer! What do you think?
ROB: I think maybe people are scared off by the tiki torches.
MONTY: Change is scary. Robbie, let me tell you a little something about the mail business. I've been in it over thirty years. And in those thirty years, the only thing that's changed is the Elvis stamp and some gun laws. People are bored! They wanna shake things up!
ROB: I thought people just wanted their mail delivered on time.
MONTY: Aloha! Welcome!
ROB: Relax, Monty. It's just my sister.
