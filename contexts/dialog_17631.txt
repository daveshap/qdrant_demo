ROPER: It might have happened no matter who was up there.
MCCALL: Bullshit! Would it have happened to you?
ROPER: Maybe... There's one thing you have to remember... You don't create the situations. You can only try to save people from them.
MCCALL: I thought I could do it. I was so damn sure of myself. But I didn't know what to say. The words wouldn't come. My mouth turned to mush. You make it look so easy, Roper. But it is not. It's not easy. It's a different job than looking through the rifle scope.
ROPER: That it is.
MCCALL: How many have you lost?
ROPER: I look at it as how many I've saved. That's the way you've got to look at it.
MCCALL: And what about the ones you don't save?
ROPER: You live with it... and they haunt you. It doesn't leave.
MCCALL: And what if you can't live with it?
ROPER: You've got to decide that for yourself.
