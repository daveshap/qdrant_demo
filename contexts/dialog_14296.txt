MAX: This is pretty.
JACKIE: Uh-huh.
MAX: Who is this?
JACKIE: The Delfonics.
MAX: '76?
JACKIE: '74, I think.
MAX: It's nice.
JACKIE: I called in sick this morning. As far as the airline knows, I'm still available.
MAX: Are you?
JACKIE: I don't know yet. I'm going to talk with Dargus and Nicolet today. Do what you suggested. Offer to help and see what happens.
MAX: What I meant was have a lawyer do the negotiating for you.
JACKIE: I want to talk to them first. I know more now about Ordell's money.
MAX: Well, if the A.T.F. guy is the one who wants you, that'll only interest him up to a point.
JACKIE: It's a lot of money. About a half-a- million dollars. All of it in Cabo in safe deposit boxes and more comin' in.
MAX: How'd you find that out?
JACKIE: He told me last night.
MAX: He called you?
JACKIE: He came by.
MAX: What?... What'd you do?
JACKIE: We talked.
JACKIE: He had his doubts at first. But he's always trusted me an wants more than anything to believe he still can.
MAX: Why?
JACKIE: He needs me. Without me all that money is just gonna sit over there in Cabo. Sugar?
MAX: No thanks. There's gotta be other ways to get it out.
