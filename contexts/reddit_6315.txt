filling out forms for a new pt iob, question about bank info
i'm filling out all the papers they need from me and one of them is the direct deposit form and they need my bank acc info and stuff. it says to attach a void check but i don't have any so i just wrote all the stuff down. however dad keeps saying to screenshot the bank info from the app on my phone and print that out and attach. is this a weird move? should i do this lmao does this make sense to do
