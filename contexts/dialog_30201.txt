BISHOP: It's a generous offer, Mr. Galvin... ...nothing can make the woman well... but we try to compensate... to make a gesture...
GALVIN: How did you settle on the amount?
BISHOP: We thought it was just.
GALVIN: You thought it was just.
BISHOP: Yes.
GALVIN: Because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount. Two Hundred Ten Thousand. That would mean I keep seventy.
BISHOP: That was our insurance company's recommendation.
GALVIN: Yes. It would be.
BISHOP: Nothing that we can do can make that woman well.
GALVIN: And no one will know the truth.
BISHOP: What is the truth?
GALVIN: That that poor girl put her trust in the hands of two men who took her life, she's in a coma, her life is gone. She has no family, she has no home, she's tied to a machine, she has no friends -- and the people who should care for her: her Doctors, and you, and me, have been bought off to look the other way. We have been paid to look the other way. I came in here to take your money. I brought snapshots to show you. So I could get your money. I can't take it. If I take it. If I take that money I'm lost. I'm just going to be a rich ambulance chaser. I can't do it. I can't take it.
