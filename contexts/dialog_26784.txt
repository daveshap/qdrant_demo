WALLACE: So, you never heard of him.
STEVE: Nope.
WALLACE: Do you know who Arturo Toscanini is?
STEVE: Sure.
WALLACE: He's as big as Toscanini, maybe even bigger. In this neck of the woods, he's probably Bob Hope and Betty Grable rolled into one.
STEVE: Jeez, and I never heard of him.
WALLACE: You were in insurance before the war.
STEVE: Right. Claims assessor.
WALLACE: Conscientious, determined, dogged.
STEVE: They said I was dogged?
WALLACE: Well, they say here that when you went on a case, you stayed on it. Now we can't take every Nazi in this country to trial, although I would like to; it's an impossibility. So we're going for the big boys in industry, education, law, culture.
STEVE: Like this bandleader.
WALLACE: Well, he's more than just a bandleader, Steve. He's a great conductor, a gifted artist. But we believe that he sold himself to the devil. Your number one priority from this moment on is to connect him to the Nazi Party. Don't be impressed by him. I want the folks back home to understand why we fought this war. Find Wilhelm Furtw√§ngler guilty. He represents everything that was rotten in Germany.
