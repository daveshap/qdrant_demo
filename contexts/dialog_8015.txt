JIM: You did it at your house? Your own house?
DAVE: Look, Jim... Okay. I know it all seems crazy, and maybe it did start out, you know, for the... for the sex and the danger. But now it's different. Jim, what I'm trying to tell you is that Tracy and I are totally, totally in love.
JIM: In love?
DAVE: Yeah, it's serious. I mean she inspires me in ways Sherry never has. She even wants to read my novel.
JIM: But you haven't written your novel.
DAVE: That's the whole point. It's all in my head; it's right here. I just got to get it out there. Tracy wants me to write it so she can read it. It's beautiful.
JIM: Dave, I'm just saying this as your friend. What you're doing is really, really wrong, and you've got to stop.
DAVE: You're not just jealous, are you? I mean, we both used to talk about her
JIM: That was just talk! Fantasy talk! What are you, nuts? We talk about girls all the time, but it doesn't mean anything. I would never. . . I mean, I take very seriously our strict moral code. The line you've crossed is... it's illegal and it's immoral.
DAVE: I don't need a lecture on ethics, Jim, okay? I know what --
JIM: I'm not talking about ethics. I'm talking about morals.
