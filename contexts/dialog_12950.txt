THOMAS: Is my daddy okay?
TALLEY: The doctors are taking care of him right now. Thomas . . . are you safe? Can you talk?
THOMAS: I think so.
TALLEY: I need your help with something. But if you think those guys could catch you, then I don't want you to do it, okay?
THOMAS: Okay.
TALLEY: I'm serious, Thomas; I don't want you to get hurt.
THOMAS: What do you want me to do?
TALLEY: Your dad has two computer disks. They have funny names: Marlon and Al.
THOMAS: He has lots of disks.
TALLEY: I think he was working on them today, so they're probably in his office. Could you find them and see who they belong to?
THOMAS: Dennis won't let me go to the desk. He makes me sit on the floor.
THOMAS: But I might be able to sneak into the office if they're not around. Then I could open the disks here in my room.
TALLEY: I thought they locked you in your room.
THOMAS: I can get into the crawlspace from my closet and climb all over the house.
TALLEY: Can you get into the office?
THOMAS: I can get into the den. The office is right across the hall.
TALLEY: If I get Rooney into the back of the house, can you find the disks without being caught?
THOMAS: Yes, sir.
MARTIN: I want to know what in hell you're doing.
TALLEY: I'm looking for you. I need your tactical unit.
MARTIN: I'm not stupid! You can't get out of here fast enough, then you take back command; you agree to wait on Smith, then you risk everything in a stupid stunt to get him out --
TALLEY: Don't question me, Captain! This is <u>my</u> crime scene!
MARTIN: -- then when you get him, you damn near assault the man in the ambulance! <u>What</u> <u>is going on</u>?
