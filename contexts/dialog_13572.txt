DONOVAN: My name is Donovan. Walter Donovan.
INDY: I know who you are Mr. Donovan. Your contributions to the museum over the years have been extremely generous. Some of the pieces in your collection here are very impressive.
DONOVAN: Well, like yourself, Doctor Jones, I have a passion for antiquities. Have a look over here. This might interest you.
INDY: Well, it's sandstone. Christian symbol. Early Latin text. Mid-Twelfth Century, I should think.
DONOVAN: That was our assessment as well.
INDY: Where did this come from?
DONOVAN: My engineers unearthed it in the mountain region north of Ankara while excavating for copper. Can you translate the inscription?
