OPERATOR: Hello, operator services.
PHREAK: Hello, operator? I'm having trouble dialing a number.
OPERATOR: What number please?
PHREAK: 555-4202.
OPERATOR: Just one moment.
PHREAK: Thank you.
KATE: Hello?
PHREAK: Hey, it's me.
KATE: Phreak?
PHREAK: I'm freaking! Joey wasn't making it up! He really hacked into Ellingson! He gave me the disc with a file he copied and now I'm in jail! They're charging me with some serious shit! And there's stuff I didn't even do, like inserting some virus called Da Vinci, and they keep asking about you guys.
KATE: You think they're going to bust us?
PHREAK: Yeah! You better figure out what's on that disc, cause we're being framed. It's in that place where I put that thing that time?
