MARIE: And you have no idea -- not a clue -- what came before that?
BOURNE: No.
MARIE: When you think of it, before the ship -- before you wake up on the ship, what do you see?
BOURNE: Nothing. It's just not there.
MARIE: Well, this is great. I'm sick of myself and you have no idea who you are.
BOURNE: I kept trying things, I thought if I could find all the things I could do, I could --
MARIE: -- you could put it together --
BOURNE: -- which was okay for a while, I was okay with it... But then -- there's all these other things -- all these other things I know how to do -- and this -- this stuff from the bank and... I think something bad happened.
MARIE: What are you talking about?
BOURNE: I don't know.
MARIE: Sounds like you were in an accident or something.
BOURNE: I was shot twice in the back.
MARIE: Okay, so you're a victim.
BOURNE: There was a gun. Who has a safe deposit box with a gun and all this money and all these passports?
MARIE: Lots of people have guns. You're American. Americans love guns.
BOURNE: I fought my way out of an embassy. I climbed down a fifty-foot wall -- I went out the window and I was doing it -- I just did it. I knew how to do it.
MARIE: People do amazing things when they're scared.
BOURNE: Why do I? -- I come in here -- instinctively -- first thing I do -- I'm looking for the exit -- I'm catching the sightlines -- I know I can't sit with my back to the door --
MARIE: You're paranoid. You were shot. It's natural.
