Wasted my 20s. Love to work with words, but zero contacts. Where can I professionally go as I approach 30?
I messed up my 20s. 

*Very* long story short, I suffered a crippling depressive episode that lasted for a good year and a half. I got kicked out of school a few months before I turned 20 and didn’t really get back into it until I turned 22. I was so exhausted from my mental health issues (in my early-20s, I was diagnosed with persistent depressive disorder, ADHD, and clinical anxiety, none of which went treated until I was in my later-20s due to problems with my insurance) that I just wanted to get my degree and graduate. 

And I finally did back in 2016. Since then, however, I’ve been bouncing around from dead-end job to dead-end job, unable to accumulate enough experience or good will to puff up my resume. I’ve landed a great job before (incredible benefits, easy work, friendly enough co-workers), but I struggled so much with the “work from home” aspect that I fell behind and, eventually, was let go. 

I’m turning 30 in a few months and I’m at an absolute loss. I’ve felt discouraged before, obviously, but always with a hint of hope ahead. It’s really hard to be optimistic, however, when you’re reaching the end of what everyone calls “the most important decade of your life” and have nothing to show for it. 

**I went to school for communications.** I didn’t have a specific path to take with it; I settled for the most generic BA I could get that didn’t make me want to blow my brains out. **I love to write, to work with words and grammar.** I’m often the go-to proofreader among my group of friends and was even given the side-gig of proofreader/assistant editor at a few of my jobs/internships. 

The problem is that I have no idea what to do with that. I live in SE Michigan, close enough to Detroit to commute, I guess. Despite Detroit having an expanding downtown filled with flashy companies, none of them are hiring for a job that puts emphasis on writing, editing, or proofreading (at least not on any of the job sites, from LinkedIn to Indeed and everything in between). 

There are a few small publishing houses on the west side of the state (Ann Arbor, Grand Rapids, etc), but there lies the other problem: I’ve never learned how to put together a writing portfolio. I’ve asked my writing professors, but (surprise surprise!) *none of them know.* I’m so glad that what little money I make is going toward student loans I had to borrow for an academic experience in which my professors literally couldn’t offer me the one piece of knowledge I would desperately require after school!

I know I’m rambling at this point, but I’ve been a “long-time lurker” for a while now and I missed a student loan payment this past month due to being unemployed and I’m just picturing my entire fucked-up future flashing before my eyes all because I wasted my 20s. I’m at my wit’s end here, and if anybody would be able to offer a helping hand, I’d be extremely appreciative.
