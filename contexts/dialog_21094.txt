GALLAGHER: Isn't he the one that always writes about things - only the things he knows about?
STEW: Right.
GALLAGHER: Didn't he go to sea before he wrote about it?
STEW: Right.
GALLAGHER: Then why don't you write about something you know? Write about yourself and Anne. The poor boy who marries a rich girl - now there's a swell theme.
STEW: Gee, that's an idea, Gallagher. That's an idea there. I wonder now...
GALLAGHER: Oh, sure. She'd make a beautiful heroine...
STEW: And there's her mother - and what a character that old dame would make with her double-strength - and that lawyer friend of theirs - he'd make a great villain - and there's you!
GALLAGHER: What could I be?
STEW: You could be something. I've got an idea, Gallagher. Let's get this set. That's a great idea for a play. Pal, get me a cigarette, will you?
GALLAGHER: Here you are.
STEW: All right, thanks. Now, let's see. How will I start? Hey pal, how would you start?
