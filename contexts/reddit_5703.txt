Am I at a disadvantage to finding a job because I'm out of the workforce?
I've been searching for a job for 4 months now. I've had a few phone screens and interviews, but they ultimately lead to nothing. Am I doing something wrong? I'm getting really worried that it's only going to get harder to find employment with my resume gap growing ðŸ˜¥ I graduated college and got a temporary job as Assistant Director for a summer camp, but now I'm looking for full time work.
