AULON: Jeanne's alive!
DUNOIS: Good.
AULON: We have to press home the attack!
DUNOIS: Sound the retreat...
AULON: But I promised Jeanne we'd fight on!
DUNOIS: I made no such promise. Sound the retreat for the night!
AULON: But that was her order!
DUNOIS: I'm fed up with taking her orders. She swore she'd defeat the English before nightfall, instead of which she goes and plays the fool and gets herself nearly killed! Look at the mess we're in! That's her mess, not mine...! We're worse off then if she'd never come at all! ... now do as I say and Sound the Retreat!
