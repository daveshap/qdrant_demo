KURTZWEIL: You'd be shit out of luck if not for me. You saw what you saw because I led you to it. I'm putting my ass on the line for you.
MULDER: Your ass? I just got chased across Texas by two black helicopters.
KURTZWEIL: And why do you think it is you're standing here talking to me? These people don't make mistakes, Agent Mulder.
MULDER: What? What's wrong?
SCULLY: Salt Lake City, Utah. Transfer effective immediately.
SCULLY: I already gave Skinner my letter of resignation.
MULDER: You can't quit, Scully.
SCULLY: I can, Mulder. I debated whether or not to even tell you in person, because I knew --
MULDER: We're close to something here -- we're on the verge --
SCULLY: You're on the verge, Mulder -- please don't do this to me --
MULDER: After what you saw last night -- after all you've seen -- you can't just walk away --
SCULLY: I have. I did. It's done.
MULDER: Just like that --
SCULLY: I'm contacting the state board Monday to file medical reinstatement papers --
MULDER: I need you on this, Scully --
SCULLY: You don't Mulder -- you've never needed me. I've only held you back. I've got to go.
