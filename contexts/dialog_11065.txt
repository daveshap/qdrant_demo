ROTH: Enjoy.
MICHAEL: I saw an interesting thing today. A man was being arrested by the Military Police; probably an urban guerrilla. Rather than be taken alive, he exploded a grenade hidden in his jacket, taking the command vehicle with him.
MICHAEL: It occurred to me: the police are paid to fight, and the Rebels are not.
SAM ROTH: So?
MICHAEL: So, that occurred to me.
