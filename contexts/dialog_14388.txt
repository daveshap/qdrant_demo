DOCTOR"": Dream on!
JACOB: No! Oh God.
SARAH: Jacob, what can I do?
JACOB: Save me!
NURSE: Well, don't we look better this morning? That was a hard night, wasn't it?
JACOB: Where am I?
NURSE: Lennox Hospital.
JACOB: I'm awake?
NURSE: You look awake to me. Here. Drink some of this.
JACOB: Where's Sarah? Where did she go? She was here ...
NURSE: No. No. You haven't had any visitors.
JACOB: That's a lie. My family was here.
NURSE: I'm sorry.
JACOB: Last night! They were as real as you are!
JACOB: This is not a dream! This is my life.
NURSE: Of course it is. What else could it be?
