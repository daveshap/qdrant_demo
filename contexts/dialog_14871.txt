MARTIN: Clay something, that was his name - Clay.
JIM: Bertrand. Clay Bertrand?
MARTIN: Yeah! That's it. I don't know. Maybe it wasn't. I gotta go.
JIM: Clay Bertrand. He's in the Warren Report. He tried to get Oswald a lawyer. Was Kennedy ever discussed, Jack?
MARTIN: Sure. 'Course they hated the sonofabitch, but...
JIM: The assassination, Jack?
MARTIN: Never. Not with me sir, never... Listen, I think I'd better go. I said enough. I said all I'm going to say.
JIM: Hold on, Jack. What's the problem?
MARTIN: What's the problem? What's the problem? Do I need to spell it out for you, Mr. Garrison? I better go.
JIM: Nobody knows what we're talking about, Jack.
MARTIN: You're so naive, mister.
BILL: Well, it's a terrific yard, Chief, but the man's an obvious alcoholic with a reputation lower than crocodile piss.
JIM: Does that bother you, Bill? I always wondered in court why it is because a woman is a prostitute, she has to have bad eyesight.
BILL: He'll never sign a statement, boss, let alone get on a witness stand.
JIM: When something's rotten in the land, Bill, it generally isn't just one fish, we'll get corroboration... find this Clay Bertrand. If I were a betting man, I'd give you 10 to 1 it's an alias. Start checking around the Quarter.
BILL: And the six of us, with almost no budget and in secret, are going to solve the case that the Warren Commission with dozens of support staff and millions of dollars couldn't solve. We can't keep up with the crimes in the Parish as it is, Chief.
JIM: The murder of a President, Bill, is a crime in Orleans Parish too. I didn't pick you because of your legal skill, you know.
BILL: Gee, thanks boss.
