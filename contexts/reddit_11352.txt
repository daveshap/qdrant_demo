Feeling helpless at the fact that I never seem to be able to catch up.
I'm always on the verge of catching up on bills and payments but something always seems to happen right as I'm about to not have to worry. Getting my hopes up and having them crushed every single month is so stressful and I'm getting to the point of not being able to handle it. The worst part is that it's not like I'm behind by an extreme amount, if I had $800 everything would be caught up and I wouldn't ever have to stress. That small amount pays for the medical bill I have, a ticket that I was unable to dispute due to it being hours away from where I live, and water/electric that got backed up which are getting ready to be disconnected. $800 is such a small amount of money to most people, hell phones cost more than that, and it is so unobtainable for me. Paying the ticket is a must, if that's not paid by the 1st of the year then my license is suspended which is another several hundred. I work outside so it's a weather permitting job. I refused to stay home last week because I need the money and now have pneumonia. Weather is bad again this week but now that I have an added medical bill I can't not work. Everything hurts and I'm ready to stop throwing up/not being able to eat from stress (plus side on that is I'm saving money on food lol).
