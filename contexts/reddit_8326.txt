What are some reasons a President of the United States- like President Trump, would hire outside legal counsel?
According to https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-05-24/trump-said-to-hire-longtime-lawyer-kasowitz-for-russia-probes  and https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/05/23/trump-retains-outside-lawyer-marc-kasowitz-to-help-with-russia-investigations/?utm_term=.c82d64c663f3 President Trump has hired outside legal help with the Russian probe.  There are a few parts to my question:

1) Specific to President Trump, what are the implications of this?
isnt the Attorney General the presidents lawyer? With A.G Sessions having recused himself, wouldn't the deputy A.G step up to be the presidents attorney?

2) Who are some recent Presidents who have hired outside counsel, and for what reason did they hire?
