JIMMY THE DEMON: Knock, knock.
DAD: Yes, Jimmy.
DAD: No, no, that's not what I said. He can keep his thumbs, but the fingers gotta go.
JIMMY THE DEMON: Oh, and don't forget, you're shoving a pineapple up Hitler's ass at four o'clock.
DAD: This was a very difficult decision, because I have three wonderful sons. I mean, Adrian, so smart, so ruthless. And Cassius, so strong, so tough. And Nicky, so... so...
NICKY: Don't worry about coming up with anything. It's cool.
DAD: Such a sweet boy. But after much thought and careful consideration, I've decided that the ruler for the next ten thousand years is going to have to be... me.
