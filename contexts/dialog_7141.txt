ELLEN: I saw the light. I thought maybe you were up.
DAVE: Oh... Yeah.
ELLEN: Mind if I sit down?
DAVE: No.
ELLEN: That was quite a thing you did today.
DAVE: Anybody would have done it.
ELLEN: Oh, I don't think so. Still, you helped a lot of people.
ELLEN: Kind of reminds me of that thing you did back in the state legislature.
DAVE: Oh yeah? Me, too.
ELLEN: You weren't in the state legislature.
