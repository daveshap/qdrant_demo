Extracting columns from shapefile into new raster using ArcGIS Desktop? Using ArcGIS 10.4I have a line (shapefile) with lots of information. In 8 columns there are groups of species (Group 1 to Group8), indicating if this is the dominant species group in the area or not. Then for every row there is one group that has a 1 (dominant) and all the other 7 have a 0. In rare cases non of the species groups is dominant (all are 0). Now, I need ONE raster file with this information. My idea was a raster with the numbers 1 to 8 indicating the dominant species group. But I cant get it to work. First I used feature to raster to extract each of the 8 columns. Then I tried to merge them into one raster with the mosaic to new raster tool. But of course this only gives me a file with 0 and 1 again.How could I get this done?
