MAMA: Constanzia. We expected you last week; we sent the car to pick you up at the airport last week.
CONNIE: I know, it was chaos; but anyway, here I am one week late. This is for my Mama. You remember Merle?
MAMA: Yes, thank you.
CONNIE: How are the kids?
MAMA: Well, thank you, they asked for you all week.
CONNIE: I got surprises for everybody!
MAMA: Bought at the airport.
CONNIE: This is swell. Where's Michael? I've got things to get straight with him and I can't wait on line.
MAMA: You go see your children first, and then you wait to see your brother like everybody else.
