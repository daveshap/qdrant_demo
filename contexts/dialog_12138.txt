HAROLD: Hamburger Heaven.""
PENELOPE: Heaven.
PENELOPE: Can I help you, sir?
HAROLD: I think so, daughter. How old are you?
PENELOPE: Eighteen-- and a half.
HAROLD: A springbok, an oryx, a gemsbok--a gazelle.
PENELOPE: Sir?
HAROLD: Raw hamburger, please--and a whole onion. I want to eat the onion like an apple. Do you understand?
PENELOPE: Yes, sir. It was a very unusual automobile. It was a Cadillac, but it had water buffalo horns where the bumpers should be. And what to drink?
HAROLD: What time do you get off work, my child?
PENELOPE: I'm sorry, sir, I'm engaged to be married. My boyfriend would be mad if I went out with another man.
HAROLD: Did you ever daydream that you would one day meet a friendly millionaire?
PENELOPE: I'm engaged.
HAROLD: Daughter--I love you very much.
PENELOPE: You don't even know me.
HAROLD: You are woman. I know woman well.
PENELOPE: This is crazy.
HAROLD: Destiny often seems that way. You're going to marry me.
PENELOPE: What do you do for a living?
HAROLD: My parents died in an automobile accident when I was sixteen years old. They left me a brewery and a baseball team--and other things. I live for a living. I've just come back from Kenya--in Africa. I've been hunting Mau Mau there.
PENELOPE: Some kind of animal?
HAROLD: The pelt is black. It's a kind of man.
