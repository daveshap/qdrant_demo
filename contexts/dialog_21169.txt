BRANDON: He's a fellow with a very hard knee, and he knows how to use it.
BETTY: You don't know who he is?
BRANDON: He's not a cop. A cop wouldn't have kneed me.
BETTY: He was following us--but he's not a policeman.
BRANDON: Us?
BETTY: All right--following me.
BRANDON: Why?
BETTY: No matter. There's nothing I can do about it.
BRANDON: Anything I can do about it?
BETTY: Take me home--and forget you ever saw me. That's a silly remark isn't it?
BRANDON: Try not talking.
BRANDON: It still doesn't matter if I kiss you?
BETTY: Nothing matters.
BRANDON: No use waiting, then.
BRANDON: That's the second round I've lost tonight. That fellow hurt me.
BETTY: So have I.
BRANDON: From you, I like it.
MANAGER: Good morning. Can I do something for you?
BETTY: I'm Miss Mayfield. Is Mr. Campbell here?
MANAGER: I'm Mr. Campbell, Miss Mayfield. Purely as a matter of routine, I want to ask the name of your bank.
BETTY: Bank?
MANAGER: Merely for our records, Miss Mayfield. It's usual for the guests who come here for the first time.
BETTY: I'm carrying quite a large sum in Travelers checks. How much of a deposit would you like?
