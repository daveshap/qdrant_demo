Job Application Help
Throw away account for obvious reasons. 

I applied to a position at the end of May, just before the closing date. I have still not heard anything back. I emailed the committee 2 weeks ago asking for an update, and it was past along to them. Still nothing. Now it has been more than a month and I have not heard anything. This is a dream job for me, but waiting this long is rather difficult. The university job website says the application is still under review, but it has been over a month now since the application closed. 

Any recommendations that I can follow, without coming of as pushy?

Thanks (:
