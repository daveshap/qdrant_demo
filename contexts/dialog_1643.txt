ALVY: You look very pretty.
ANNIE: Oh, no, I just lost a little weight, that's all. Well, you look nice.
ALVY: You see, I-I've been thinking about it and I think that we should get married.
ANNIE: Oh, Alvy, come on.
ALVY: Why? You wanna live out here all year? It's like living in Munchkin Land.
ANNIE: Well, whatta you mean? I mean, it's perfectly fine out here. I mean, Tony's very nice and, uh, well, I meet people and I go to parties and- and we play tennis. I mean, that's... that's a very big step for me, you know? I mean... I'm able to enjoy people more.
ALVY: So whatta you... You're not gonna come back to New York?
ANNIE: What's so great about New York? I mean, it's a dying city. You read Death in Venice.""
ALVY: Hey, you didn't read Death in Venice" till I bought it for yuh."
ANNIE: That's right, that's right. You only gave me books with the word death" in the titles."
ALVY: That's right, 'cause it's an important issue.
ANNIE: Alvy, you're incapable of enjoying life, you know that? I mean, your life is New York City. You're just this person. You're like this island unto yourself.
ALVY: I can't enjoy anything unless I... unless everybody is. I-you know, if one guy is starving someplace, that's... you know, I-I... it puts a crimp in my evening. So wanna get married or what?
ANNIE: No. We're friends. I wanna remain friends.
ALVY: Okay. Check, please. Can I -can I... Can I... Can I...
ANNIE: You're mad, aren't you?
ALVY: No. Yes, of course I'm mad, because you love me, I know that.
ANNIE: Alvy, I can't say that that's true at this point in my life. I really just can't say that that's true. I mean, you know how wonderful you are. I mean, you know... you're the reason that I got outta my room and that I was able to sing, and-and- and, you know, get more in touch with my feelings and all that crap. Anyway, look, I don't wanna- Listen, listen, listen, uh h'h, so whatta you up to anyway, huh?
ALVY: The usual, you know. Uh, tryin' t' write. I'm workin' on a play. Jesus. So whatta yuh saying? That you're not comin' back to New York with me?
