I’m lonely
So... I’m 20 and I’m so fucking lonely. I don’t have a boyfriend and never have had one.
i only hooked up with a few guys at random parties when I was way too drunk to even remember it.
I’ve always told myself that I needed to get my life together before I commit to someone else but now that I did it, I think something’s wrong with me ???? I don’t know I feel like crying just thinking about it.
Sometimes I think I’m afraid to fall in love if that even makes sense or that someone would never like me for who I am and then I think I’m the problem. It’s not beauty related because I do think I’m pretty and all but..
Don’t know what to do other than feel like shit all the time
