The cycle has ended!!
After lurking on this sub for the better part of a year, I thought that I would share some good news about how this sub has helped me.

For some background: I'm a 1st generation college student, "aged-out" foster youth who recently graduated after 7 years of trying. I suffered from a TBI during college, leaving me both disabled physically and partially mentally (both with mental health issues, a learning disability, and possible MS diagnosis). To top it off, I've been homeless 6+ times in my life, twice during my college career. During this ordeal, finances were my #1 concern since I don't have family to back me up when the going gets tough. This meant eating scraps during college 'winter break', crashing on someone's couch during a transition, or getting internships from cities multiple miles away so that they would offer me housing and pay over a long summer period.

While the process wasn't pretty, I hadn't had formal access to budgeting or information about things like healthcare and 401k's. My upbringing didn't teach me and my university sure as heck didn't assist. That being said, this sub was my saving grace. This community has kept me out of the hole regarding credit card debt, bad credit scores, and high APR rates for car loans. As of today, I have just accepted a job offer of 63k/year (in the midwest) and start next week; this is 3x larger than my highest hourly rate since I started working at 16.

I can't thank this community enough. You acted as both my parent and mentor giving me guidance when I needed it most. The best that I can do is make this hopefully inspiring post and give my heartfelt gratitude/advice to others. So, from the bottom of my heart; thank you.

TLDR; OP broke 3rd generational poverty due to this sub; please give yourself a pat on the back and keep doing what you're doing! <3

Edit: I returned to see that this had blown up!! Thank you for all of your well wishes and advice. I will never forget today or the love that I feel right now. <3
