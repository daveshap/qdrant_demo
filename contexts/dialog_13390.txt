EDDIE: Don't you want to know where I'm going?
SARAH: No. Yes, I want to know what for. But I don't want to ask.
EDDIE: I'm going to Kentucky. To Louisville. With a friend. Try to make some money. I need it, the money. I'll be leaving early in the morning.
SARAH: Leave now.
EDDIE: Oh, grow up.
SARAH: Why should I?
EDDIE: Sarah, I'm going to Kentucky to play pool, with a guy by the name of Findley. Now, I need the action and I need the money. I told you I'd be back.
SARAH: If you were going to come back you wouldn't have taken me out tonight. You wouldn't have bought this dress. You're hustling me, Eddie. You've never stopped hustling me.
EDDIE: Now, I never hustled you. Even when I thought I was. You know it.
SARAH: What do you want me to do? Just sit here and wait? Faithful little Sarah. Pull the shades down and sit. When you feel like coming back, you'll come back. And you'll love me. And then you'll go away again. Is that your idea of love?
EDDIE: I got no idea of love. And neither have you. I mean, neither one of us would know what it was if we saw it coming down the street.
SARAH: I'd know it, Eddie. I'd know. For God's sakes, what are you trying to do to me? I love you.
EDDIE: Well, what's your idea of love? Chains?
SARAH: No. I made you up, didn't I, Eddie? You weren't real. I made you up, like everything else. There was no car crash, Eddie. When I was five, I had polio. I was never an actress. The rich old man is my father. He walked out on us when I was seven. He sends me a check every month. That's how he buys his way out of my life. The men I've known... after they left, I'd say they weren't real, I made them up. But you, Eddie. I wanted you to be real.
