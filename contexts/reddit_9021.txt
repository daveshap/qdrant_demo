Has Affirmative Action in the United States worked as intended?
[Affirmative action in the United States is a set of laws, policies, guidelines, and administrative practices "intended to end and correct the effects of a specific form of discrimination."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirmative_action_in_the_United_States)

In 1961, President John F. Kennedy issued [Executive Order 10925](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_10925) in order to "take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed and that employees are treated during employment without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin." A few years later, following Kennedy's assassination, LBJ brokered the [Civil Rights Act of 1964](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1964) through congress, and followed up in 1965 with [Executive Order 11246](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_11246), later amended with [Executive Order 11375](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_11375), to include sex-based discrimination in the laws, and "to correct the effects of past and present discrimination." Since, there have been [many cases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirmative_action_in_the_United_States#Legal_history) of expanded regulation and court rulings to expand on how these laws and Executive Orders effect our country.

Looking at [data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics from 2014](http://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/race-and-ethnicity/archive/labor-force-characteristics-by-race-and-ethnicity-2014.pdf) and the [U.S. Census Bureau data from 2015](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/table/RHI125215/00), it appears that unemployment rates are about double for certain minorities (Black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Two or More Races; exact numbers available in BLS report, Table 1). However, if we look at the racial breakdown of our workforce, and compare it to the Census data, the representation appears to be very close to equal, despite the higher unemployment rates of certain minorities.

Can we say beyond a reasonable doubt that affirmative action has either worked or failed? Is race-based affirmative action an effective course of legislation for the United States, instead of something like class-based affirmative action? Or is there some alternative method that I haven't mentioned here?
