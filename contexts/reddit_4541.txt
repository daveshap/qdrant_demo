Reached out to my doctor because my mental health is really bad right now but the earliest appointment I could get was a month from now
Everyday is so miserable. I'm so horribly self deprecating and hopeless that I'm not okay unless I'm rewatching a funny show that I like. I've been watching it for three weeks and the world keeps getting worse and making life feel even more pointless and horrible. What can I do to help myself for the next month before I can meet with someone about finding a new medication and a therapist?
