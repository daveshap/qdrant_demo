Passive Low Pass Filter What I want to do is make a low pass filter using a simple RC circuit (first order), or possibly an LC circuit (which would be second order). Right now, I am in the process of determining the values for the resistance of the resistor and capacitance of the capacitor (I'm currently going with the RC circuit idea). As the equation is f=1/(2*piRC), I understand that if I want a crossover frequency of 200Hz, I will have theoretically infinite choices or R and C. Which values are better to choose? I've heard I should choose C first, because capacitors are more difficult to find in the right denomination. Still I am left with a few hundred possibilities.Also, is there a best choice of type of capacitor? (electrolytic, etc)My application, if needed, is that I want to filter out high frequencies of sound from entering my car sub woofer (powered by a 70 W amp), so I'm going to put the low pass filter between the amp and sub woofer (I would put it upstream of the amp, but in this case, the amp and head unit are one in the same device).Thoughts?
