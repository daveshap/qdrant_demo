Recruiters in other Countries
Does anyone have any advice for reaching out to recruiters in other countries? Specifically looking for recruiters in Canada but all google is giving me is recruiting jobs. I've found a couple recruiting agencies but they don't seem to place consultants/managers. It's mostly labor. I'm obviously missing something. Any help is appreciated! Visa is not an issue here. Thanks!
