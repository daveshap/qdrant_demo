Clustering / Grouping on image's pixels I have an image, and im building a model to recognize a pattern in that image and classify it. There is however a lot of noise in the rest of the image, but the actual pattern to classify will always be the biggest continuous figure in the whole image.I want to pre process to isolate this bit, before running it in something like a CNN, and I was wondering if standard libraries had an algorithm that was able to find this 'longest non-zero streak' in my image matrix.
