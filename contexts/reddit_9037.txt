According to a recent NY Times OP Ed, Sessions supported executing people convicted twice of drug trafficking. Does any know the details of the bill?
For example what types of drugs and how much they had to traffic in order to be executed?

Here is the article "Although Mr. Sessions participated in a capital system stacked against defendants, his main policy concerns seemed to have been that Alabamians were being executed neither quickly enough nor for enough types of crimes. He promoted a bill seeking to eliminate a stage of the capital appeals process and another to execute people convicted twice of drug trafficking. Neither passed."
