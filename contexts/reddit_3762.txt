While the media is bringing only negative, toxic news to your mindset, I will tell you how you can come out of this crisis more sociable and with more confidence than before.

When was the last time you were forced to sit at home with plenty of time, no restaurant to go to, no activity to do outside and no distractions?

Right now is the perfect time to look at your life and ask yourself:

Am I happy with my life?

Do I feel fulfilment in my relationships?

Do I feel lonely?

How would this crisis be different if I had a person by my side whom I care about?

Sometimes life gives you a chance to review the way you are living. Don't take it as a thing that is ''bad''. You have the opportunity to self-reflect and set some goals - Don't waste it with binge-watching Netflix. 

The choice is yours. 

Do you want to come out of this crisis the same as before? Nothing will have changed. Except that you will have watched every series on Netflix.

Or do you want to come out of this lockdown smarter and more confident because you finally set plans and asked yourself what exactly is bothering you about yourself and your life?
