Just got a job as an office assistant, I have no idea what the fuck I’m doing. Any advice for my first day tomorrow?
So I applied to be a receptionist, but the manager interviewed me for ALL positions basically. He asked questions and threw some scenarios at me for sales, front desk, and office assistant.    
I guess he didn’t want me as a receptionist and decided he would offer a position as an office assistant at another location. Which I’m cool with! I’ve actually always wanted a job like that and it pays a little more. The commute is 15 minutes longer but whatever, I’ve been desperate to break out of minimum wage with no degree and a disability that prevents me from doing physical labor.    
         
The manager is really cool. He told me I’ll need to start dressing business professional and when I said I couldn’t afford to he said I have 1 month to get a basic wardrobe going. Until then I can wear my regular clothes. He also told me the training is a month long process and very thorough.   
But I’m still VERY nervous! I’ve never had a job like this before at ALL. I’ve only done retail/food. And now suddenly I’m going to work in an office. What the ????       
I feel like I don’t deserve the position. I’m 22 so definitely not the youngest person to do this kind of job but I feel like I’m not even adulty enough...if that makes sense. I tried on some business clothes and I looked like a little kid playing dress up. I’m not educated. I’m not smart. I’m not that organized. I’m just a dummy who got lucky and I feel like everyone’s gonna find out I’m a fraud, even though I didn’t lie about anything and he knows my work history / experience is a joke.     
    
Anyways....I really want to do well. Maybe even impress them! But I at least don’t want to disappoint them.
