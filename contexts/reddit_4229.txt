Have you ever deleted your tinder account but not because you found someone, rather because you felt something was off?
Ive been on tinder countless times over the last five years. But lately I feel like something is off with my account. I don’t feel confident enough with it, i don’t get good vibes. Maybe I’m just feeling this way because I’m not in a good place right now but I was wondering if it happened to you too?
I often see the same people on tinder just with different accounts. What about? 

At first I wanted to make another account right away after deleting this one. But maybe I’ll just take a break since it doesn’t bring anything good in my life for now.
