How to ensure I’ll have a job once I graduate?
Finishing a MSc in Computational biology in May, and I hope to immediately transition to a job. I have none of my own money, and I’m tired of living off of my parents. Additionally, I do not want to possibly live with my parents after graduation because 1) They live in the middle of absolutely fucking nowhere and this will severely hinder my ability to find a job in a good city (ie Boston, NYC), and 2) We argue about stupid shit constantly and they would most likely force me to stop taking the hormone replacement medication and force me to start living as a male again, and if I did that I would likely become too depressed to even search for a job. 

Sorry for the personal details, but some advice on how to easily find a job would be much appreciated
