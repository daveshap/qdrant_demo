Finding equipotential surfaces of gravitational field Consider a point $A$ located in New York city. How to find a point $B$ located in Chicago with the same gravitational potential as $A$? Is there any practical method of doing this? And with what accuracy can this be done?For two points in an ocean, far from shore we can probably take water surface as the first approximation, and make correction for the tide. But I do not see what can be done on land.If the points $A$ and $B$ are not far away, say less than a mile, I can connect them with a pipe and fill this pipe with water, the water levels at the ends of the pipe will give me the points of the same potential. But this is not practical for distant points.EDIT. This question has an important practical application: hitting a small target with a ballistic missile.
