See highlighting when an overlapped point is selected? I have two points with the same location (with the same geometry point). It seems that I'm dealing with a overlapped selection bug because having those two points when I choose the second (the one on top) through the attribute table will be shown a highlight selection which is OK but if I choose the first one (the one below) it simply doesn't highlight. Which it is very confusing since that it means that the first point is a point without geometry, which is not true. When you have overlapped points QGIS will select only the top ones (in my case the last record on my table).Is this a bug or in fact is a property that I can change in some place on QGIS settings? If so, where can I change that to show always the highlight selection for overlapped points?Note: My QGIS version is 2.18.16
