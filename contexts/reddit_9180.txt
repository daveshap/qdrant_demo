I got offered an extra 8 hours a week at work for the rest of the year since they had someone quit unexpectedly and I feel like I won the lottery.
I am dancing right now. This will mean a couple hundred more a month which means that I can actually afford to put a decent amount in savings, pay some debt, and afford Christmas gifts! Just wanted to share my good news with a sub I've been lurking on for a while and who have helped me get through life struggling financially.

Edit: it's actually not OT, I should have been clearer. I get full time benefits but I only work 32 hours a week so this extra 8 just brings me up to 40 so definitely managable! Thank you everyone for your concern though!
