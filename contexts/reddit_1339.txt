I'm going to look at my bank account balance and work on a budget tonight. I've been putting it off for months, but no matter how much it scares me, I'm going to do it.
Checking my bank account balance gives me horrible, heart-pounding anxiety. I'm afraid I'll hate myself after seeing how much I've spent, and I also have some residual anxiety from when I was living paycheck-to-paycheck. However, I'm sick of feeling weighed down by money anxiety. The knowledge that I spend money impulsively, don't follow a budget, and don't check my bank account weighs on me \*heavily\*, and I'm ready to shed that weight. Wish me luck.

Edit: I did it! I went through my expenses, cancelled 5 subscriptions (yes, 5), set up a monthly transfer so I can automatically build my savings account, and went through my Mint account to see where I'm spending my money. My goal for January is to cut back on food spending.

Thank you so much for your encouragement! I still have more to do, but I made some great progress tonight. :D
