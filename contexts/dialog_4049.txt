JEFFREY: God. you scared me.
MRS. BEAUMONT: Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
JEFFREY: Nothing. I'm fine.
MRS. BEAUMONT: You can't just stay out half the night and carry on, Jeffrey. There's got to be some order, Jeffrey. I thought it would have been nice to call your father when you got home but now it is much too late.
