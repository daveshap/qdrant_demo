2 job offers dilemma
I received a job offer from company A a few weeks ago which I accepted because my contract work was coming to an end. I will be starting at company A next week. Lo and behold, I received an interview from company B, which I applied for during my job hunting period.  After interview and checking my references and background company B called me earlier this week and said they approved my position and verbally asked if I would accept. This is my dream government position and so I accepted and my start date is in mid September. Because it is government, it took them a while to go through my background check before they can approve me. I am still waiting for my offer letter, and the manager said to wait until next week. 

My dilemma is that I have not received an official offer letter from company B and so I feel like it’s not official yet and nothing is set in stone. However, given by how the manager communicated very thoroughly through every step of the application process and actually set a start date for me, I am pretty sure it’s official they are just waiting for their HR just as much as I am. 

I have not told company A that I will not be starting yet. On one hand, I would hate to start with company A for the few days then quit for company B. I don’t want to burn bridges. On the other hand, if I quit company A before I start just based on the fact that company B will extend an offer letter to me, and there is that small possibility the offer does not go through, I would end up with no jobs. I have been applying for over 6 months for jobs and I feel very fortunate to land two offers in a very saturated field, but it was still a very anxious period of my life. 

I am a fairly new grad (graduated in 2018) and my first job was a contract position, so I don’t have experience in these type of situations. I would very much appreciate your input. What would you do in my situation? Thank you in advance!
