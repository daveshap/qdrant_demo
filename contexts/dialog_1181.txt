MOZART: Wonderful! He liked the monkey, didn't you?
SCHIKANEDER: Yes, well, it's all good fun.
MOZART: I liked the horse.
SCHIKANEDER: Isn't he marvelous? He cost me a bundle, that horse, but he's worth it. I tell you, if you'd played Don Giovanni here it would have been a great success. I'm not joking. These people aren't fools. You could do something marvelous for them.
MOZART: I'd like to try them someday. I'm not sure I'd be much good at it.
SCHIKANEDER: 'Course you would. You belong here, my boy, not the snobby Court. You could do anything you felt like here - the more fantastic the better! That's what people want, you know: fantasy. You do a big production, fill it with beautiful magic tricks and you'll be absolutely free to do anything you want. Of course, you'd have to put a fire in it, because I've got the best fire machine in the city and a big flood - I can do you the finest water effects you ever saw in your life. Oh, and a few trick animals. You'd have to use those.
MOZART: Animals?
SCHIKANEDER: I tell you I picked up a snake in Dresden last week - twelve foot long - folds up to six inches, just like a paper fan. It's a miracle.
SCHIKANEDER: I'm serious. You write a proper part for me with a couple of catchy songs, I'll guarantee you'll have a triumph- de-luxe. Mind you, it'll have to be in German.
MOZART: German!
SCHIKANEDER: Of course! What else do you think they speak here?
MOZART: No, no, I love that. I'd want it to be in German. I haven't done anything in German since Seraglio.
SCHIKANEDER: So there you are. What do you say?
CONSTANZE: How much will you pay him?
SCHIKANEDER: Ah. Well. Ah, I see you've got your manager with you. Well, Madame, how about half the receipts?
MOZART: Half the receipts! Stanzi!
CONSTANZE: I'm talking about now. How much will you give him now? Down payment?
