PARRISH: I was a little abrupt with you this afternoon, Drew. Forgive me. I want you to know I value your advice.
DREW: As much as Joe's?
PARRISH: You're competitive soul, Drew. That's what makes you a great addi- tion to the money. Joe is just... around.
DREW: For how long? And why?
PARRISH: Please. Don't worry about him. And above all, don't antagonize him.
