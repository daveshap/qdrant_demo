19 and a loser
My 19th birthday is fast approaching and I’m getting anxious. 
The majority of my friends are moving away for university and I’m on a gap year, but I don’t start traveling until December. 

I have a part-time job but aside from that I don’t have anything to do on a day-to-day basis.

I’ve never been in a relationship or been kissed for that matter. I’m scared of being lonely - I’ve tried to talk to guys but they’ve never returned anything :(
It’s embarassing - all my high school life, I compared myself to my best friends, I was a late bloomer but, they always seemed to be surrounded by boys :((

I just ugh what if it doesn’t happen ? What if I reach 20 or 21 without ever having anyone ? It’s weird and I hate it
