LORENSON: Why don't you help me?
STARKS: Because I don't have time.
LORENSON: Why not?
STARKS: I'm about to die unless I do something to stop it.
LORENSON: And how do you know that?
STARKS: Because of the future. I know what's going to happen.
LORENSON: William, that is just another facet of my delusions.
