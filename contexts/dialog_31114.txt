SANDRA: Kelly. What is it?
KELLY: I miss Dad.
SANDRA: Jesus. Well, I do too, sometimes...
KELLY: No you don't.
SANDRA: He didn't have to kill himself, Kelly. He could have gone out and gotten a job. Christ, he could've found another rich woman... He never had a problem tucking my friends when we were married.
