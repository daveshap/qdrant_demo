Need girl help
So I'm friends with these two girls that both like me. One is a blonde, really fun and energetic, decent face, not really any body, and the other is a brunette, good face, good body, but she can be really bitchy at times. Oh, and they are best friends. How divide which one to go after, and without hurting the others feelings?
