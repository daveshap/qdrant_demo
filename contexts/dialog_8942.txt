FRANK: No.
JACK: Nothing. We get nothing.
FRANK: I told you, Jack. It's a telethon. No one gets a cent.

FRANK: I don't know. Some disease.
JACK: What disease?
FRANK: I don't know.
JACK: You don't know?
FRANK: It's a disease, Jack. We're against it. It's not a moral decision.
JACK: What channels it on?
FRANK: Seventy-one
JACK: Seventy-one? What's seventy-one?
