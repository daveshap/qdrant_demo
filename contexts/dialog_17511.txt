ALLISON: I do it because I love you. Because everybody I loved you. Mommy -- wher- ever she is -- Susan, Quince, the people who work for you, everybody who's ever known you.
PARRISH: Yeah? And what about my enemies?
ALLISON: They respect you. Isn't that a kind of love?
PARRISH: I haven't been the father to you that --
ALLISON: That you've been to Susan?
PARRISH: I wasn't going to say --
ALLISON: But that's what you were thinking. And that's okay. Because I know you love me. Not like it is with Susan, the way your eyes light up when she comes in the room and the way she always gets a laugh out of you, as opposed to me when I walk in a room and that look comes over your face, What does she want now?""
