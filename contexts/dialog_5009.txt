JENNIFER: What happened?
NICOLE: Buffy was on the uneven parallels -- she was really good; coach said she could have been in the Olympics -- but she was doing a routine, spinning, and the beam broke.
JENNIFER: You're kidding.
NICOLE: Snapped. Buffy was, you know, on the upswing, and I swear to God she went across the room. Perm over heels.
JENNIFER: Oh, my God! Ouch! No wonder you quit.
NICOLE: Well, that's the thing. She landed on her feet. Didn't even sprain a toe. And I go up to her and she turns and looks at me and she's like this --
NICOLE: -- like she's gonna kill me.
BUFFY: I was just scared is all.
NICOLE: No. It was mondo bizarro.
KIMBERLY: Buffy, the ape-woman.
NICOLE: Seriously, Buffy. That look was way twisted. What were you thinking about?
