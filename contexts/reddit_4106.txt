Sick of being single? Offend someone.

Through the recent tragic suicide of my ex fiance of 8 years (and me essentially becoming a widower before being a husband, at age 36), in which during the final minutes of his life, he has skype video called me — a call that lasted a full 90 minutes... from 7790 miles away... in 1080p... not asking me to save him.. but wanted my blessing for his final journey in his 3rd attempt after suffering from 4 years of depression... with a plate of charcoal burning on the side and more than a dozen sleeping pills already ingested...  — it got me thinking :

&#x200B;

why did he trust me in dying when many others don’t even have someone who ***ever*** have trusted them in living?

&#x200B;

My body is mediocre, face is acceptable, earn in low 6-figures but nowhere close to being a 1%-er, and definitely not the nicest person around. Am I that lucky, or is everyone else so unlucky ?

&#x200B;

For perpetually single folks, ranging from the uber hot very successful types, good enough all around but lower self esteem, circuit party queens, to so-so quality guys, I think I finally found the common theme that links them, which also points to each of those solving the wrong problem, and the solution I'm proposing doesn’t involve any part of physical appearance or money either —

&#x200B;

**THEIR WILL TO TAKE A STAND**

&#x200B;

The one common theme among this vast array of friends and acquaintances is that, driven by their desire to either maximize friend gain or minimize friend/potential candidate lost, all have a personality that prevents them from willing to take a stand ... on anything.

&#x200B;

Taking a stand doesn’t have to be on political topics. Doesn't have to be as polarizing as #RESISTANCE vs. #MAGA. e.g. Publicly declaring you like Benz over BMW is taking a stand. Saying you like Korean cuisine but not Japanese ones is taking a stand. Packers over Eagles is taking a stand. But saying you like everything and don’t hate anything isn’t taking a stand.

&#x200B;

Taking a stand must involve prioritizing one item over another, and not hiding the preference when others inquire about it. Secretly loving Star Trek over Star Wars but telling others you love both or you have no pref isn’t taking a stand.

&#x200B;

But that also entails the single risk all of the groups appear unwilling to bear — the risk of offending ANYONE. If u like A over B and make the preference public, people who like B may not understand why, and thus may get offended, however unreasonably that may be.

&#x200B;

So, this group of people, fear of losing any potential partying buddies or dating candidates, would present themselves as friendly-to-all, care-free, opinion-free (and maybe even cage-free), while punting all decision-making to someone else (deciding something on behalf of others is also taking a stand, even something as basic as like deciding a place for lunch) It goes back to them being single... because what exactly is dating?

&#x200B;

**Dating is someone willing to take a stand...** ***ON YOU*****.**

&#x200B;

Someone willing to pick you. Someone willing to shoulder the risk of offending his friends who don’t like because they believe you are important, and believe you are worth it. But it has to be reciprocal and mutual - they expect that you also would've taken a stand on him in the process.

&#x200B;

The obvious question to ask is — why would anyone be willing to take a stand on you when all they see is someone unwilling to take a stand on anything? Not just something, but **ANYTHING**, and ***EVERYTHING***.

&#x200B;

Many of them kept thinking others found theirs due to shear. dumb. luck.

Some thought their body isn’t hot and buff enough.

Some thought they’re not rich enough.

Some thought they’re not nice enough.

&#x200B;

So they all waste time solving the wrong problem, and doubling down when the solution doesn't seem to have yielded returns (in their minds : "....yet"). But it boils down to — maybe, they aren’t principled enough to have principles. Start with taking a stand on everyday life options, like a car, a ski resort, an island in Hawaii, a book recommended by Oprah, a game console (yes, i'm the nut job who loves Nintendo Switch), take the risk of potentially offending one of your 4500 facebook "friends" and 6000 IG "followers",

&#x200B;

...and maybe, one day, someone is willing to take a stand on you.
