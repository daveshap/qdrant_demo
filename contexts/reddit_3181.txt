My best talent is being able to mind my own business (the personal, not financial kind). How do I turn this into a career?
To find a career, I was asked to think of something I'm *good at*, not necessarily even something I *like*. The best thing I've got going on for me is making friends easily - most people like me more than I like them. This is because I don't butt into other peoples' business, share unwanted opinions, and keep out of other peoples' stupid squabbles.

 I'm bad at math, not good with machines, cannot emotionally handle working with children, animals or the elderly, and the humanities aren't a real job (trust me I've tried).

 Working in a factory and doing ape labour makes me violently suicidal.

 With a set-up like this, what's the best I could do? How do I make lemonade out of this?
