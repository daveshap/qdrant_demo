I'm 30. I want to change career...but to what?
I read a bunch of articles that suggested identifying my skills, what I enjoyed and not enjoyed, to help figure out what I want to do. See below. Tried a few different sectors. But I still feel clueless. 

I'm looking for suggestions on career direction. Can anyone help please?

* **Customer service/sales** \- Don't enjoy being at the front line. Worked in retail/fashion and events management, both of which I lost interest very quickly. Also worked at a healthcare clinic startup, where thankfully instead of directly selling treatments to patients, I briefly managed the sales team (interim till Sales Manager came on) and drafted the initial sales strategy (enjoy).
* **Graphic and product packaging designs** \- know the basics of Illustrator, Photoshop and Indesign. Did some basic work - logos, website wireframes, print materials, photo editing, and product packaging designs for a small skincare line. Very therapeutic, but in the long run I don't have the patience to...well, echoing another redditor's comment, explain why this shade of colour is better than your grandma's choice.
* **Accounts Payable and Accounts Receivable** \- I like looking at numbers once in a while. I was pretty good with Maths back in high school, though ended up pursuing a BA, so my maths is somewhat rusty. I also enjoy working with Excel, but majority of my roles only uses Excel on a beginner level - rarely requires the usage of Vlookup, pivot table, spreadsheet modelling etc.
* **Digital marketing** \- basic familiarity. Had a 3 month exposure to it a couple of years ago as an assistant. I've been reading up on how to get in, but not 100% sure I will like it. Partly because...wouldn't it be ironic to be in the field but doesn't use/have facebook, instagram etc? Further, when I had the opportunity to manage social media for a company, I wasn't motivated enough to make it happen.
* **Project management skills** \- currently pursuing a PMP certification. Based in a place where there's a very conservative, certificate-oriented hiring culture. Even if being certified in PMP isn't a requirement, I've been told that it provides some assurance for the employer (yes, I am aware that being certified doesn't translate to doing well at the job, but unfortunately many conservative employers here think certified = excel at the job)
* **Setting up/improving business processes/procedures** \- worked at a startup where process/procedures were either not in place or could be improved. What I did were relatively small-scale processes and procedures, but it was nice to be the one to set up or improve them. At another job, I also restructured the front desk operations.
* **Brand management** \- took an intro course, which I had fun with. So the concepts are there. But I don't have a huge amount of brand management experience. While I did help build the brand at the startup, my involvement was mostly in designs with some strategy planning.
* **HR -** familiar, as I was the unofficial HR assistant/manager in two of my previous roles. Not a path I want to pursue.
* **Business Strategy** \- Only had a small snippet of this in helping the startup refine the strategy and vision.

I also like researching and investigating things, and learn new softwares. I tried learning how to code, which is nice when I'm learning leisurely. But I would be terrified to code as a full-time job.

Sorry for the long read. Thanks for reading this far. Hope that I can get some help in brainstorming this.
