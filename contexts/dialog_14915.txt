JIM: Gentlemen, I will not hear this. I value Bill as much as anyone here. We all need to make room for someone else's ideas, Lou, especially me. Maybe Oswald is what everyone says he is and I'm just plain dumb wrong.
AL: I've seen him copying files, leaving here late at night.
LOU: I just plain don't trust him anymore.
JIM: Maybe you didn't hear what I said. I will not tolerate this infighting among the staff, I warn you that...
LOU: Boss, then I'm afraid I can't continue working with Bill.
JIM: Are you giving me an ultimatum, Lou?
LOU: Well, if that's what you want to call it. I didn't ever think it would come to this. I guess I am, boss.
JIM: I will not have any damned ultimatums put to me, Lou. I'll accept your resignation.
LOU: You sure got it. You're one stubborn and stupid sonofabitch D.A. and you're making one hell of a mistake!
SUSIE: Aren't you being a little hard?
JIM: No, I don't think I am, Susie. Anyone else?
