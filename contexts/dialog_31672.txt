PETRA: Are you alright?
XANDER: What the hell are you doing? You could've killed me!
PETRA: I heard you talking. I could tell where you were in the room.
XANDER: I don't know what's going on anymore. I thought I was square with that dude. Now everybody's switching sides like it's the WWF.
XANDER: What are you doing with the Ivans?
PETRA: I know which cops are good and which are bad. Come with me. Come on, right now.
XANDER: Where are we going?
PETRA: We're getting out of this place. We've done enough.
XANDER: Wait a minute, whoa. We can't go now. What's Yorgi got planned with that nerve agent?
PETRA: It doesn't matter anymore, forget it.
XANDER: Of course it matters. Hey, hold on!
PETRA: What do we owe our governments? Yours kidnapped you, mine abandoned me.
XANDER: Petra, this ain't about the people that sent us here, you know that.
PETRA: No, now it's about us. Let's do something for us before we both get killed. Don't you want to get to Bora Bora, Xander?
XANDER: We can't leave now. We have to do something.
PETRA: Why? You're the one who believes in nothing. Screw the world, or whatever you said.
