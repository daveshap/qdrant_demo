Self-Care for Professionals and Current Grad Students
Hi all, I recently started at a small, predominantly medical focused institution and self-care in addition to a student first mindset is what I will be working with. I am wondering two things:

1. As professionals in the field, what are some self-care tips you do, personally or generally, to avoid burnout from helping these students and through hectic times in the office.

2. What do you have available for students to help them with self care? I know many other institutions have a wellness center and counseling center available, yet I am wondering if there are any activities that your school uses to help these medical-focused students. Iâ€™ve noticed there is more push on professional development and want to hear what others are doing or have done in the past.

TL;DR: Professional seeking help with self-care ideas for medical-focused students in small institution.
