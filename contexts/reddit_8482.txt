Moon-Kim Inter-Korean summit
An Inter-Korean (South Korea - North Korea) summit [took place](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/04/27/the-historic-kim-moon-meeting-as-it-unfolded/?utm_term=.429d61e15276) on April 27, 2018. The last inter-Korean summit [took place](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/26/world/asia/north-south-korea-summit.html) in 2007, and before that the first inter-Korean summit took place in 2000.

On Friday, the leaders of North and South Korea declared a common goal of the [complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/north-korea-s-kim-jong-un-crosses-border-historic-talks-n869276) They [also agreed](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/27/world/asia/north-korea-south-kim-jong-un.html) to end the [65-year war](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/north-south-korea-agree-to-goal-of-complete-denuclearisation-of-korean-peninsula/articleshow/63938516.cms) and establish peace. But the two countries [have made](https://theconversation.com/the-two-koreas-have-tried-to-make-peace-before-and-they-could-do-so-again-86809) peace agreements in the past, to no success. 

[This is the text of the agreement.](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/27_04_2018_korean_declaration.pdf)

Questions:

* Were any substantive agreements made at this summit?
* How does this summit compare to the prior Inter-Korean summits?
* How, if at all, did the foreign policy of other nations contribute to this summit?
* What progress was made towards future talks?
