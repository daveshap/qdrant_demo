LARDNER: It's a pretty massive heart attack. His lungs have filled with fluid, and, well... it seems as though his body is just... shutting down.
LUKE: Can we get him to the hospital?
LARDNER: Even if we could, and the move didn't kill him, there'd be very little we could do there that we can't do here. I'm sorry.
