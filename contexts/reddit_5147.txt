Job-Seeking friend faking Bachelors Degree & Unofficial shortened name
Hi all,
We have a friend interviewing with startups and well funded companies all around US that has the background and experience to do well and this is generally the idea they get when talking with recruiters and interviewers. This is for sales executive jobs btw so we all agree they have references to previous employers that gladly recommend them for sales roles. This is someone who has done a few million $ in sales at minimum over a decade plus.
Speaking with this friend, if they said they have a Bachelors in Business, no one would question it because they can back it up with their knowledge and experience. Here’s two facts that is always a point of discussion why they can’t land a job with this recent run:
-They didn’t actually finish college but dropped out just a couple semesters shy, but their resume will state they have a Bachelors in the school. I’ll note they do have an Associates. It’s now almost a decade since they dropped out and continuing their degree would mean starting from scratch.
-Imagine their real name was Penelope Goldsmith, due to their name always being a topic and being misspelled they unofficially shortened their name throughout all social and professional sites and resumes to Pene Gold (just a random example!) In this case, thousands of people only know them as Pene Gold and only close friends/family know their full name.

So our friend group has a rising suspicion that their interviews are going really well, most go to final steps, but they hit a wall so we’re curious if HR people could chime in:
-In this case you only know Pene Gold, would you be doing research on Pene Gold? Clearly the name brings up official social media’s, LinkedIn with heavy references and all that so the person is real but do you run a background name check and see it’s not a real name and cut the process there?
-Would you be running their name in some sort of college database? Obviously their name is not real and even if you get their real name, I guess in this case it pop up with nothing or that they only have an associates?

We’ve been clashing heads on this discussion for years now and we want to ultimately know:
-Should they go back to using their real name? Pene Gold has no govt/papertrail besides what’s been built online.
-Should they ultimately just remove the college degree from their resume and LinkedIn? Or should they keep the Associates? 

TL;DR:
-Friend unofficially shortened name years back on LinkedIn and social media so now everyone knows them as that unofficially shortened name
-Friend puts they have a Bachelors but in reality dropped out two semesters early and only have an associates. Obviously tied to their real name which no one publicly knows.
-Friend is getting to final stage interviews for $100k+ Sales Exec jobs around US with a lot of interest but they all keep dropping off magically.

We all really appreciate any input especially from HR and Founders that hire for these sort of roles.
