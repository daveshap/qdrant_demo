Man I hate this feeling
I don’t actively feel sad. I can sort of manage sad.

What’s bothering me is there’s things I *want* to do, but I’m just so unmotivated to do anything.

It sucks.

I want to draw, I tried but it isn’t working. 

I want to work on my programming project that I’m really excited about, but I can’t manage working on it for more than 10 minutes.

Same thing with this edit I’m making.

Normally video games are my go-to when anything like this happens, but I can’t get into any of them.

I hate this.
