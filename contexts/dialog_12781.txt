WILLIAMS: I couldn't plead insanity, because you see I'm just as sane as anybody else.
HILDY: You didn't mean to kill that policeman?
WILLIAMS: Of course not. I couldn't kill anybody -- it's against everything I've ever stood for. They know it was an accident. They're not hanging me for that -- they're hanging me for my beliefs.
HILDY: What are your beliefs, Earl?
WILLIAMS: They're very simple. I believe in the Golden Rule. I'm not the first man to die for preaching it. But if they would only listen to it -- we could have a fine, decent world instead of this mass of hate that makes man do such cruel things.
HILDY: How would you go about applying the Golden Rule, Earl?
WILLIAMS: I'd do away with the profit system and have production for use only. There's enough food and clothing and shelter for everybody if we'd use some sense.
HILDY: Production for use only." Well
WILLIAMS: It's the only answer. Everything has a use and if we let it be used for its purpose, we could solve all our problems. Food was meant to be eaten, not stored away in restaurants while poor people starved; clothing was meant to be worn, not piled up in stores while people went naked. Doesn't that make sense?
HILDY: Yes, that makes a lot of sense, Earl.
