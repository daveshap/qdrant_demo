PINKERTON: First of all: you, shut up. Now, you've given me a thousand miles of railroad to cover. Every time the James Gang strikes, we shift a hundred detectives to that area. But there's just too much open land, too many riverbeds to ride, caves to hide in. This gang operates across four states, often riding a hundred miles between jobs.
RAINS: I can't believe this.
PINKERTON: And there are some towns in Missouri where James and his men can walk openly, as heroes.
PARKER: How can that be?
PINKERTON: They donate money to farmers, to churches. Rumor has it they gave the sharecroppers of Maddox so much money they were able to build a school.
RAINS: With my money!
PARKER: We should go burn that school to the ground, sir!
PINKERTON: Yes, that's the way to win the locals back to our side.
RAINS: I demand action.
PINKERTON: No, you demand results. They are not the same thing. And if you want results, you will let me do my job as I see fit. Unless of course, You want this fool to saddle up and take another run at it?
RAINS: Can't you tell me anything?
PINKERTON: It's going to be a long spring.
