Can anybody enlighten me what Reviewer 1 really wants me to do? Lol
This is an interesting and creditable effort by the authors and has some interesting aspects. The main challenge for those familiar with the field will be that it appears to have been carried out without any awareness of the literature. Cationic particle toxicity has been discussed at length, also mechanistically, and all mom that is unknown to the authors, as is the role of the dispersing medium. This means the work is an interesting mixture of new efforts by the authors that are sometimes not interpreted I the light of the literature. This all leads to quite an odd outcome for the informed reader. Quite good work often, with a complete lack of awareness of the literature. 

It is hard therefore to know how to judge the paper. It is certainly a pity to lose its input entirely, but hard to know how to react.
