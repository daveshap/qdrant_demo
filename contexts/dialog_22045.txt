ASHLEY: Gabriel, you promised!
GABRIEL: I promised that when he helped us, we'd be gone! When he helped us! Loverboy don't want to play!
ASHLEY: You promised me!
GABRIEL: And you promised me you'd get your sweetheart to help!
GABRIEL: He'd rather die than be with you, he'd make a fucked-up boyfriend anyway. Bury him all over the place.
ASHLEY: NO!
