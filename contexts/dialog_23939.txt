SHERIFF COBB: You gotta calm down, Paden. Everything will be put straight in a few days.
PADEN: I saw how you're putting Mal Johnson straight.
SHERIFF COBB: I never could count on you to be reasonable. Don't force me to make an adjustment around here.
PADEN: Cobb, you've got nothing I need.
SHERIFF COBB: I'm not thinking about your future, Paden. I'm worried about Stella.
PADEN: What's she got to do with it?
SHERIFF COBB: Not a thing. She's just a mutual friend. But if you wind up on the wrong side of this, she's going to get hurt.
