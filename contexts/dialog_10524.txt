KAREN: Oh, for Christ's sake â€“-
MARTIN: I know. I'm doing Shylock instead of a shylock. Okay, what's my motivation? The acquisition of money. To collect. Inflict pain if I have to.
MARTIN: Guy owes me fifteen large and takes off, I go after him. The fuck you think I do?
CHILI: Martin, look at me.
MARTIN: I'm looking at you.
CHILI: No, I want you to look at me the way I'm looking at you. Put it in your eyes, 'You're mine, asshole,' without saying it.
MARTIN: Like this?
CHILI: What you're telling me, you're tired? You wanna go to bed?
MARTIN: Wait. How about this?
CHILI: Now you're squinting like you need glasses.
