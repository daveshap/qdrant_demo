Speaking up a little can do a lot
PhD student here. My department has a yearly overnight retreat. At said retreat, a specific faculty member harasses female students, yearly. He also is inappropriate outside the retreat but it is really bad there. Having now been to multiple and having been a target my first year (and traumatized) I finally wrote in the anonymous retreat feedback that “faculty that harass students should be banned from the retreat”. One comment, no names. That comment apparently was brought up at a faculty meeting which lead to a student meeting. That one comment and now we will be provided an anonymous survey to name the problem person and what we want done and that will be given to the department chair. 

When I sent the form in, I was angry and I was angrier because I was sure nothing would be done. Nothing big has been done yet but the fact that we are moving in a forward direction has finally given me peace of mind. 


This is a throwaway account and i’m also not sure if Professional is the right flair but I had to write it somewhere and I don’t want to talk to my fellow students so as to not ruin my anonymity.

edit: i think now they may have had the faculty meeting already planned
