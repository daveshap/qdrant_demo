I think the most disheartening thing about having anxiety is that it never goes away, you just learn how to cope better with it.
I cant see myself not having anxiety and really my heart just sinks. It’s just beyond cruel that this will be me for the rest of my life and the only thing that changes is how i manage it. There is no cure. I’m always going to be in my head one way or another. It’s exhausting.
