STANDARD: How do you feel, Dell?
BROUSSARD: Wretched. What happened to me?
STANDARD: Don't you remember?
BROUSSARD: Don't remember nothing. Can't hardly remember my name.
ROBY: Are you in pain?
BROUSSARD: Not exactly, just feel like somebody's been beating me with rubber hoses for about six years.
STANDARD: Hell, you're in great shape, you've got your sense of humor back!
BROUSSARD: God I'm hungry.
ROBY: Dell, what's the last thing you can remember?
BROUSSARD: ... I don't know...
ROBY: Do you remember the pyramid?
BROUSSARD: No. Just some horrible dreams about smothering. Where are we?
STANDARD: We're going home. We're in hyperspace.
MELKONIS: We're going into the freezers now.
BROUSSARD: I'm really starving; can we get some food before we go into the freezers?
STANDARD: I think that's a pretty reasonable request.
HUNTER: Boy do I feel a lot better. It's a straight shot back to the Colonies, and then we can start taking bids on the paydirt. Any bets on the top bid?
FAUST: Well, we should at least be able to each buy our own planet.
MELKONIS: I'm going to write a book about this expedition. I'm going to call it The Snark Log.""
STANDARD: The commander normally has first publication rights.
MELKONIS: Maybe we could write it together.
ROBY: First thing I'm going to do when we get back is eat some biological food.
MELKONIS: What's the matter, you don't like this stuff?
ROBY: Tastes like something you'd feed a chicken to make it lay more eggs.
STANDARD: Oh it's okay. I've had better cag than this, but I've had worse too, if you know what I mean.
FAUST: I kind of like it.
ROBY: You like this shit?
FAUST: It grows on you.
ROBY: You know what they make this stuff out of?
FAUST: Yes, I know what they make it out of, so what? It's food now. <u>You're</u> eating it.
ROBY: I didn't say it was bad for you, it's just kind of sickening, that's all.
