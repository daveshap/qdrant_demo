Anyone Else Have Brain Fog All the Time?
Ever since a week or two ago I've had trouble remembering things and it feels like I've been experiencing pretty bad derealization. Its like I'm hyper aware of everything that goes on around me. I feel zombified. This started soon after i began taking buspar and then upped my dose so i dont know if that could be causing it.
