PICARD: I thought Thalaron radiation was theoretical.
GEORDI: Which is why our initial scans didn't pick it up. But he's got it, Captain.
PICARD: As I remember, Thalaron research was banned in the Federation because of its bioqenic properties.
BEVERLY: It has the ability to consume organic material at the subatomic level. I can't overestimate the danger of Thalaron radiation, Jean Luc. A microscopic amount could kill every living thing on this ship in a matter of seconds.
PICARD: Understood. Keep on it. I need to know what he has and how to neutralize any threat. Give me options.
