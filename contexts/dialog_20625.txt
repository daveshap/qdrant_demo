CAROL: Welcome to the singles scene.
PEGGY: I don't know how you do it. I've never even dated anybody but Charlie.
CAROL: You just have to remember... men are like houses and trade upwards... I thought you had a pretty good marriage.
PEGGY: We did for a long time. We just got married too young, and ended up blaming each other for missing out on things.
CAROL: So he started having affairs, and you got depressed.
CAROL: You should have left here years ago, like I did.
PEGGY: It's not the place. I don't buy that. Trapped in the same town forever. The price she would pay for her teenage lust.
CAROL: After you got knocked up, my mother didn't want me to talk to you. She thought it was contagious.
PEGGY: Oh, it's not so bad. I have two wonderful kids, my own business. Still, knowing what I know now, if I had the chance to do it all over again, I'd sure do things a lot differently.
CAROL: Wouldn't we all.
