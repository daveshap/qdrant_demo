DOC: They checked in.
CAROL: Call the ranch, tell Beynotr we'll leave his cut here --
DOC: Why?
CAROL: There are three men dead.
DOC: So what. I've got to give him his money. That was our end of the deal.
CAROL: He might be ready to chop us up.
DOC: Do it my way.
DOC: Tell me about Beynon's ranch.
CAROL: I've never been there... When we met it was in his office."
CAROL: Do you trust him?
DOC: I just figure the percentages. He wouldn't try a cross until he's got the money.
CAROL: Let's send his cut back -- Just keep going.
DOC: If we make a mistake., he'll burn us. You make a deal, you're always better keeping your end up.
CAROL: I don't want to go there.
DOC: Do it my way.
