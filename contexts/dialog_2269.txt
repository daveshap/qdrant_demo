PORTER: May I help you, madam ...
EMMA: Mr. John Steed, please.
PORTER: I'm afraid that's impossible.
EMMA: Impossible?
PORTER: You are female?
EMMA: As you see.
PORTER: Then you can't come in.
EMMA: I have an appointment.
PORTER: No women. Not in Boodles. Not since 1922.
EMMA: Really -- what happened in 1922?
