TOM: You aren't planning to tell these kids that 'virgin' was tattooed into both Stacy and Rod, are you?
BRENT: No.
TOM: Good.
BRENT: But I am going to have to question all of their past boyfriends and girlfriends.
TOM: Fine, just don't mention the carving This is going to be a tough enough day as it is.
BRENT: Hi honey.
JODY: Hi Daddy. Hi Mr. Sisler.
TOM: Hi Jody.
BRENT: I just wanted to check that you were okay?
JODY: I'm fine. I've just never had someone my age die before. It's so weird.
BRENT: How well did you know Stacy and Rod?
JODY: I've been in the same class with Stacy for years but we weren't tight or anything.
BRENT: Had either of them broken up with someone recently? Hurt someone?
JODY: No. Those two were together before Kenny and I started hanging out and that's over, what, God a year now.
BRENT: I want you to head right home after school.
JODY: I will. Is that all?
