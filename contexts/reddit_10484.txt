Fuck the future, friends getting houses, a living wage. I'm so tired of feeling hopeless
First off, fuck winter. I'm so tired of spending the entire winter wanting to end it. Its ridiculous.

With the general election coming up, it's just gonna fuck over the country even more and I'm already broke. Like Â£2 in the bank broke until tomorrow night. And now friends are setting deposits on houses and settling into well paid jobs that are over 20k a year. 

Its just a repeating cycle of hopelessness. Theres literally no chance of not struggling for my entire life and I cant keep dealing with it. I'm so tired of being happy for a day then watching as everything just falls apart around me. 

I'm so fucking tired. I hate my job. I'm too depressed to write my cv since theres nothing positive to say, and I feel stupid for even thinking that. I'm just so done.
