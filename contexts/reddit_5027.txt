I didn't get the job, but one of the interviewer's wants to talk to me again to give advice and discuss the sector. How do I prepare for this?

Hello! 

Background:

I am very soon to be a graduate with a BA Hons in sociology and social policy. In February I applied for a job within my local council to be an admin officer in the housing department which I was super excited about. I didn't hear back and thought I just hadn't gotten it but they phoned me in May for a video interview!

Present:

On Monday, I did the interview with a panel of three and it went quite well, I showed my enthusiasm and knowledge around housing and they seemed to respond. However, I had a feeling I wasn't quite the right candidate.

My gut feeling was confirmed yesterday when I got a phone call to say I was unfortunately, unsuccessful. Yet, the interviewer was impressed with my enthusiasm and stated they didn't want to lose a talented individual, so they wanted to set up a casual video discussion.

This, this caught me by surprise and I wasn't quite sure what to say apart from, yes, please! They asked me if I had any questions already, but I sort of choked as I really wasn't expecting it so I am a bit afraid I came off a bit unwilling, if that makes sense? However, I am so grateful as I was dissapointed not to get the position but to be recognised was immense.


The point:

Basically, how do I not mess this opportunity up and really make the best of it?

Have any of you been in this position before?

TL;DRÂ - I didn't get the job but I have a casual meeting set up with one of the interviewers to talk about the sector and to get advice as well as feedback. How do I make the most of this?
