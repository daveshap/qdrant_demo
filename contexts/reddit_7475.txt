Advice for writing research papers
TDLR: I often write my papers in a cram state and feel guilty about it despite receiving high praise. Im asking about systems or methods you all employ to take good notes/citations so I can avoid spending up to 8 hours skimming books for citations as I write the paper. 

I am currently finishing my first year of history program (M.A.) and am interested to hear how some of you keep track of your notes/research before you write your papers.

If I’m being honest, I’ve always just complied a list of sources ahead of time and leave it until a week or two before it’s due and go into a mad dash to burn through all the texts. 

Honestly, I feel dirty doing this and feel I could produce better work (my professors say they are impressed with my work despite the fact much of it is rushed) but the issue is I often work best when I wait until the last week or so.

I think this is because I really don’t have any good systems in place to retain notes on books and authors beyond when they sit within my memory.

What I typically do now is start skimming books a week or two prior to the due date of my paper. This gives me a general idea of which of the sources I’ve collected that will be most useful. Then a night or two before it’s due I’ll sit down to actually write the paper. I’m well versed in background knowledge in my field so it’s never an issue for me to pump out an introduction to the paper but then when I get to the body, largely because I don’t have a good note taking system, I skim through books again to identify sources  to cite and this can end up taking anywhere between 4-8 hours if the paper is longer than 15 pages (most of my papers are between 20-30 pages each). 

I guess I’m just asking how do you write your papers? Do you have any systems that work well for you in terms of note taking or better retaining arguments from books?
