Obama just moved to protect Planned Parenthood funding permanently through Title X; my question is what are the mechanisms of government by which the President can do that?

Obama apparently added a new rule to Title X that says that states cannot withhold federal family planning money for any reason other than the providerâ€™s "ability to deliver services to program beneficiaries in an effective manner."

Wikipedia says Title X is a public law, but I'm not really sure what that entails. What does it mean for the President to add a new rule to a public law? Does anyone have to approve this? Articles I've read about it seem to imply that Congress and states will not have a say in it.

I'm simply looking for an explanation of the mechanisms of government involved in doing something like this, and specifically around the powers of the Executive branch as it relates to modifying laws.

I am not really looking for a discussion of the arguments for or against this specific change, but do as you will.
