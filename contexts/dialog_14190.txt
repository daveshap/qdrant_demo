POP: Hope you have a good trip, George. Uncle Billy and I are going to miss you.
GEORGE: I'm going to miss you, too, Pop. What's the matter? You look tired.
POP: Oh, I had another tussle with Potter today.
GEORGE: Oh . . .
POP: I thought when we put him on the Board of Directors, he'd ease up on us a little bit.
GEORGE: I wonder what's eating that old money-grubbing buzzard anyway?
POP: Oh, he's a sick man. Frustrated and sick. Sick in his mind, sick in his soul, if he has one. Hates everybody that has anything that he can't have. Hates us mostly, I guess.
