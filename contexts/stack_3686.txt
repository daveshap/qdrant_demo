One network that classifies three classes or two networks that do binary classifications? I've been training a fully convolutional network for semantic segmentation, more particularly a U-net, to classify three things in an image: object_type1, object_type2, and background. However, I've found better results by having two networks that do binary classification. The first network classifying just the background and object_type1 and the other network classifying the background and object_type2. Then, I can combine the results using old school techniques. My question then becomes, is this a common practice - to have two networks do the work instead of just one? Does binary classification commonly provide better results than ternary classification? If the answer to the first question is no, then is it considered bad practice to this?
