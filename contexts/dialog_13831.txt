JIM COOPER: Hi, baby.
LOWELL: Catch you later.
LOWELL: When's your deadline?
CHARLIE PHILLIPS: Monday.
LOWELL: Push it.
CHARLIE PHILLIPS: What? Forget it.
LOWELL: It's a smear campaign, Charlie.
CHARLIE PHILLIPS: It's drawn from a selectively circulated...
LOWELL: Oh, it's real selective... about as hard to get a hold of as the Manhattan phone book.
CHARLIE PHILLIPS: Well, it's authoritative and is overwhelmingly documented.
LOWELL: And it's bullshit. And if I'm right, are you going to put the Journal's reputation behind a story that's going to blow up in your face?
CHARLIE PHILLIPS: I'll take a look at what you got. But I'm not moving any deadlines 'cause you say so.
CHARLIE PHILLIPS: Are you all right?
LOWELL: Yeah. Catch you later.
