Accepted to an M.A. but received almost no financial aid. Meeting w/ Director of Admissions next week to ask for more -- any tips for preparing for that conversation?
Hi all,

&#x200B;

I was recently accepted to a fantastic program that I'm so excited about (2-year M.A. in School Counseling). Unfortunately, I received little to no financial aid. My family and I are on OK footing financially, but with a baby and my impending loss of income, I was definitely hoping for more money than this.

I have a meeting with my school's Director of Admissions next week. I'm willing to defer admission for a year if it comes to that, but I'd really like to start in Fall 2019 if possible.

&#x200B;

What are my options in terms of asking for more aid? Has anyone navigated this tough conversation successfully?

Background info:

* I am a minority male who would be entering a field dominated by white women. I'm not exactly looking to throw down the race card though, yikes. Is there a way to tactfully highlight the value I bring to this profession?
* I do not have another acceptance letter to "compare against", though I don't even know if that's a thing for grad schools....
* School costs \~$36k per year including books, fees, tuition, etc. I received a $2,500/year award that's given to every person in this program. No aid beyond that, from the school or from the government.
* I plan on going part-time (< 20 hours/week) at my current job to help cover the costs of school. My job would pay more than any graduate assistantships on-campus.

Thanks in advance for any help you can offer!
