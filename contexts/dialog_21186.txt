KILLAINE: Thanks. Lovely view you have, haven't you?
BRANDON: I never notice the view after the first week.
KILLAINE: I would. Fancy waking up every morning with that in your lap. Wonderful thing, money is. Remember what Somerset Maugham said about it ?
BRANDON: I wouldn't know.
KILLAINE: Money is a sort of sixth sense that gives meaning to all the others." Very appealing
BRANDON: Could we discuss that some other time?
KILLAINE: Sure. Let's discuss Betty Mayfield. How long since you saw her?
BRANDON: A couple of hours.
KILLAINE: I have a warrant for her arrest.
BRANDON: That must hurt.
KILLAINE: I've always thought you were a pretty nice guy, Brandon. I'd like to go on thinking so. If you tried to help her get away--
BRANDON: Would that make me a heel?
KILLAINE: You'd be breaking the law.
BRANDON: Doesn't answer the question.
KILLAINE: The only answer I have for you.
BRANDON: You passed up a dozen chances to arrest her. What toughened you up?
KILLAINE: Information.
BRANDON: Don't kid me. You don't think she murdered Mitchell.
KILLAINE: It could have been an accident.
BRANDON: That COULD BE TOLD.
KILLAINE: Not if she knew she wouldn't be believed.
BRANDON: Your concentrating too hard, Killaine. What about Margo West? She had a motive. I guess you know by this time whose gun it was?
BRANDON: And old man Clarendon? He had a motive, too. Margo and her money.
KILLAINE: Mitchell was killed down here. How could Clarendon get in to do it? Or Margo for that matter.
BRANDON: How could Mitchell? After that act he put on up here, is it likely she'd let him in?
KILLAINE: She didn't have to. He could have climbed down from here.
BRANDON: Mitchell was too drunk.
KILLAINE: Or just drunk enough. He was with her when she registered. He knew where her room was. You were out most of the evening. There was a lot of mess to clean up . Waiters coming and going, the door standing open. Suppose Mitchell came in to grab a drink for himself, then wandered out on this balcony, then realized betty's balcony was just below yours.
BRANDON: Romeo in reverse. Uh-uh. No sale, Killaine.
KILLAINE: You don't buy it. Okay. So I still want Betty Mayfield. Where is she?
BRANDON: No idea.
