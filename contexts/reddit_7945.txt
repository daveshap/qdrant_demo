Grant writing - never done it before. Resources appreciated!
I’m a first year grad student and imposter syndrome is real- I’ve never actually written a grant before. I am applying to a small grant due in the next few weeks but my advisor wants a draft by Sunday because he’s going out of town. Any resources people would recommend for a crash course in writing a good grant application?

This particular grant is internal to my school and each component is <400 words, so very small but I’m stressing myself out a bit since it’s just not a thing I’ve done but it’s generally experience a lot of first year students already seem to have.
