I can't believe that I'm settling for a job that I never planned on keeping.
I got this job while I was in college in hopes that it'll help me financially until I finished my education. Now that I stopped going to school and haven't been back I'm now unhappy and stressed that I will be stuck on this job because I haven't figured out what to do for a career.
