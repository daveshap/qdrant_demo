ELWELL: I hate J.J. -- but not that much at this moment...
SIDNEY: Give me a chance --
SIDNEY: Don't you know who that man is?
RITA: Yeah. Otis Elwell. The columnist.
SIDNEY: Yeah!
RITA: And he's a perfect stranger to me.
SIDNEY: So take five minutes! Get acquainted! He's an important man - he's lonely - don't be dumb!
RITA: What do you want all of a sudden - Lady Godiva...? Where's my other shoe?
SIDNEY: What kind of an act is this?
RITA: Don't you think I have any feelings? What am I? A bowl of fruit? A tangerine that peels in a minute?
SIDNEY: I beg your pardon! I turn myself inside out to help you and now I'm a heavy. Here's your shoe, there's your coat, that's the door!
RITA: Sidney...I...I don't do this sort of thing...
SIDNEY: What sort of thing?
RITA: This sort of thing!
SIDNEY: Listen, you need him for a favor, don't you! And so do I! I need his column--tonight. Didn't you ask me to do something about your job? Don't you have a kid in Military School?
