What is the history of transgender service in the US military, and what specific policy changes are entailed by President Trump's tweets on the matter this morning?
This morning, on twitter, President Trump announced he will ban transgender people from serving in the military:

This announcement [reverses an Obama Administration policy lifting the ban on transgender service members serving openly.]( http://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/pentagon-lifts-ban-transgender-service-members-serving-openly-n601816)  

The most recent [RAND estimate](http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_briefs/RB9900/RB9909/RAND_RB9909.pdf), from 2016 found:  

>...between 1,320 and 6,630 transgender service members are in the active duty military, while between 830 and 4,160 members are in reserves duty. RAND based its study on data from previous research, and estimated midrange figures of 2,450 transgender people in active duty and 1,510 in reserves. There are about 1.2 million active duty military servicemembers overall.
  
Questions:  

1) What is the history of transgender service in the military?

2) What specific policy changes is President Trump calling for?

3) What are the legal, financial, operational, and personnel implications of the policy?  

4) Is there evidence of a benefit to allowing or not allowing transgender people to join the military?
