HARRY: What can I do, old man, I'm dead, aren't I?
MARTINS: You can help her.
HARRY: Holly...
HARRY: ...exactly who did you tell about me? Hmm?
MARTINS: I told the police.
HARRY: Unwise, Holly...
MARTINS: And - Anna...
HARRY: Did the police believe you?
MARTINS: You don't care anything at all about Anna, do you?
HARRY: Well, I've got quite a lot on my mind.
MARTINS: You wouldn't do anything.
HARRY: What do you want me to do?
MARTINS: You can get somebody else...
HARRY: Do you expect me to give myself up?
MARTINS: Why not?
HARRY: It's far better thing that I do... Holly, you and I aren't heroes, the world doesn't make any heroes...
MARTINS: You've got plenty of contacts.
HARRY: Outside of your stories...I've got to be careful.
HARRY: I'm only safe in the Russian Zone... I'm safe as long as they can use me...
MARTINS: As long as they can use you?
HARRY: I wish I could get rid of this thing.
