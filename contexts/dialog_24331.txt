AUGGIE: So, what brings you to a dive like this?
PAUL: It's his birthday so we decided to whoop it up a little.
AUGGIE: How old, kid?
RASHID: Seventeen.
AUGGIE: Seventeen? I remember when I was seventeen. Christ, I was one little whacked-out son-of-a-bitch when I was seventeen. Is that what you are, son? One little whacked-out crazy fella?
RASHID: Definitely. I'd say you've hit the nail on the head.
AUGGIE: Good. Keep it up, and maybe one day you'll grow up and become a great man like me.
PAUL: Hey, Auggie, I've just been thinking. You wouldn't need some help around the store, would you? Some summer help while Vinnie's gone?
AUGGIE: Help? Hmm. It's possible. What did you have in mind?
PAUL: I'm thinking about the kid. I'm sure he'd do a good job for you.
AUGGIE: Hey, kid. You interested in a job? I just got word from your employment agency that you're looking for a position in retail sales.
RASHID: A job? I definitely wouldn't turn down a job.
AUGGIE: Come around to the cigar store tomorrow morning at ten o'clock and we'll talk about it, okay? We'll see what we can work out.
RASHID: Ten o'clock tomorrow morning. I'll be there.
