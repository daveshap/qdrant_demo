Someone at my school lied about being best friends with a guy who died to get into a top school
Fyi, I know about this since he told me and the rest of his friend group about this.

There are certain kids at my school who are known to be smart & hardworking students. He wasn't one of them, at all. He had some good ECs related to his major & interests (poli-sci with the goal of going to law school), but didn't have that great of stats. He decided to apply to UChicago ED because of how much weight they put on their essays and their reputation for taking chances on students with slightly worse-than-average stats. He then came up with plausible-sounding fake extenuating circumstances. A kid at school had died freshman year after being hit by a drunk driver, so he claimed he was best friends with this kid and became deeply depressed after his death, contributing to a bad GPA. Our counselor presumably didn't know they weren't actually friends because our school is huge, and so corroborated this in her rec letters. He also worked this into his essays by saying it was this accident that sparked his interest in activism/law. 

The facts? He hated that kid and didn't care *at all* when he died.

He ended up getting in ED. Not only did he literally use someone's death to his benefit, he also basically took away attention from all the kids who actually worked hard to get in. 

It just goes to show how the whole process goes to twist people. I know this guy, and unless he's a super good actor or something, he's not some sort of sociopath. He's an average, normally actually really nice guy, and this process changed him into a guy who literally bragged about how smart he was for using someone's death to his advantage.
