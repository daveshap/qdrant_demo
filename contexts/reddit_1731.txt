Accepted to Monsters University!
It’s been my dream school my entire life and I’m so glad I got in! My friend Sulley was also admitted but he had to do a gap year. 

My stats for those who were wondering:

SAT: 1600
UW GPA: 4.0
APs: AP Scaring (4), AP Hiding (5), AP Screaming (3, not sending)

ECs: nothing special 
Hooks: I only have one eye and I talked about how that affected me in my life and how I grew because of it. (7/10)

Hopefully you guys get in! Go monsters !
