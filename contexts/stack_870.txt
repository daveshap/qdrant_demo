I'm using Ubuntu Server for a simple home server - do I need cloud-init? Having installed it (18.04), I then came across cloud-init and was initially quite confused. If I've understood correctly, its purpose is to provide instance initialisation/customisation for a system launched on a cloud platform. I'm not in this environment - I'm used to hard-wiring config changes and not have something mess with them. For me, cloud-init looks to be just an unnecessary layer of confusion.So, have I understood what cloud-init does? Do I need it, and if not, can I get rid of it without breaking anything?
