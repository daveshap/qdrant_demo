Recent college graduate having difficulty landing a job due to lack of experience
I graduated college in May with a Bachelor's degree in public relations and a minor in social work (which was my first major until I switched). I changed my major to PR junior year because I realized social work just wasn't working for me. In that time I was so busy cramming classes together, working as a waitress 4-5 days a week to pay my bills, and dealing with a toxic relationship that I didn't even have time to consider an internship which is highly encouraged in college. I was taking classes consecutively that were technically supposed to be pre-requsite classes. Everyone in my classes had already or were working in a job or internship in our field and I just remember sitting in class having major anxiety having no idea what I was doing because it was all so new to me. I made all A's and did really well in my class work, but now I'm graduated with no job experience other than restaurant and retail so I feel like I'm dropping my resume for jobs and cover letters highlighting my skills within my field and it's not even being considered. It got to a point where I didn't even apply for jobs for about 3 months because I kept getting so discouraged. I've had a couple of interviews that ended in rejection and I feel like it's because I let my anxiety and self-doubt interfere in the process and wasn't able to seem confident. I've tried to make an online portfolio to showcase work I did within my classes (media advisories, press releases, campaign and event plans, etc). but I can't find a website that I find easy to maneuver because I'm low-key not very tech savvy haha. Idk, I just don't know what to do anymore and I guess I'm just looking for advice or someone going through the same issues. I know I can do the work but I feel like no one is giving me a chance. I'm becoming very depressed about it. I'm just ready to start working and stop worrying about money all the time .
