Additional skills in pursuit of being a Policy Advisor (NZ)
Hello,

I'm on my last year of university (I'm 24 years old) completing my Bachelor of Arts majoring in Political Science. I want to become a Policy Advisor here in NZ. There is a fair amount of jobs at the moment (about 495+) so I assume there will be roughly the same at the start of next year.

Because I don't have an additional major such as Public Policy (although I've studied it in my current major), Law, Statistics or Philosophy and its a little late to add it on, is it a good idea to pursue a Certification/Certificate in Technical Writing and perhaps Statistical Analysis? There are some online certifications I'm eligible for.

Would this help give me a bit of an edge when it comes to finding jobs once my degree is completed? I'm currently learning our native language "Te Reo Maori" as its a sort after language and much of the job ads are now written in English and Te Reo Maori.

Thank you for any help you may give.

Cheers,

Faja-Curti.
