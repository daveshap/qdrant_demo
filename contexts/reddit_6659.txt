How do you negotiate a salary for a W2 contract to permanent hire?
I'm currently employed through a staffing agency in a contract W2 position. My manager at the company I work for recently told me that I will be hired directly by the company and he asked me to submit a salary request. I'm not really sure where to come in at, though?

Most of the information I've found online for folks moving from contract to permanent is for 1099 contract positions that offer no vacation, health insurance, or 401k match- and so by moving to permanent + those benefits, you can actually expect a decrease in salary. However- my staffing agency provides me with all of those things already- so I don't see how I could have a reduction in pay as is common in those other scenarios.

My thinking is that my company is likely paying the staffing agency my salary + at least 20%, so if I request my salary +10-15% more, me and my company would both win.

Does that sound like a reasonable approach? Or am I crazy to think I can expect an additional 10-15%?

Thanks!!
