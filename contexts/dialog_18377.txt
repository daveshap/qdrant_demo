JEFFERSON: Well, it isn't much, but if you insist, here's this week's.
PAINE: Boy Stuff." Why
JEFFERSON: Thank you, sir.
PAINE: Even to the hat. Same old dreamer, too. One look at you and I can see him, back of his old roll top desk, hat and all, getting out his paper. Always kept his hat on his head so as to be ready to do battle. Clayton Smith, editor and publisher, and champion of lost causes.
JEFFERSON: Yeah, Dad always used to say the only causes worth fighting for were lost causes.
PAINE: You don't have to tell me Jeff. We were a team, the two of us, a struggling editor and a struggling lawyer. The twin champions of lost causes, they used to call us.
JEFFERSON: Ma's told me about it a thousand times.
PAINE: His last fight was his best, Jeff. He and his little four-page paper against that mining syndicate and all to defend the right of one small miner who stuck to his claim. You know, they tried everything, bribery, intimidation, then--well--
JEFFERSON: Yes, Ma found him slumped over his desk that morning...
PAINE: Shot in the back. I was there. I can see him at that old roll top desk, still with his hat on... still with his hat on...
JEFFERSON: I know. I suppose, Mr. Paine, when a fellow bucks up against a big organization like that, one man by himself can't get very far, can he?
PAINE: No.
JEFFERSON: Washington!
MCGANN: Yeah, for the fifth time, Senator-- Washington.
JEFFERSON: My pigeons--I better see about my pigeons.
MCGANN: The porter's got them. They're coming.
JEFFERSON: Just a minute, I better make sure.
MCGANN: Boy! My head's like a balloon--for two whole days. I never knew there was so much American history.
PAINE: You can't find it in racing forms, Chick.
MCGANN: Fine thing Jim Taylor wished on me-- show him the monuments--I need this job like I need ten pounds.
JEFFERSON: Here they are--I got them. They are all right.
MCGANN: Well, that ends that crisis. This way, Senator.
