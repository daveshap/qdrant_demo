STANTZ: I'll keep to the middle of the channel. We're okay to 59th Street, then we'll go ashore and take First Avenue to 79th.
VENKMAN: Are you kidding? We'll hit all that bridge traffic at 59th. I'm going to take 72nd straight up to Fifth. Trust me, I used to drive a cab.
JANOSZ: Time is running out, Dana. Soon it will be midnight and the city will be mine -- and Vigo's. Well, mainly Vigo's. But we have a spectacular opportunity to make the best of our relationship.
DANA: We don't have a relationship.
JANOSZ: I know. Marry me, Dana, and together we will raise Vigo as our son. There are many perks that come with being the mother of a living god. I'm sure he will supply for us a magnificent apartment. And perhaps a car and free parking.
DANA: I hate and despise you and everything you stand for with all my heart and soul. I could never forgive what you've done to me and my child.
JANOSZ: Many marriages begin with a certain amount of distance, but after a while I believe we could learn to love each other. Think about it.
DANA: I'd rather not.
SPENGLER: It's working. The positive GeV's are climbing.
VENKMAN: They love you, Lib. Keep it up.
VENKMAN: So far so good.
SPENGLER: I'm worried. The vibrations could shake her to pieces. We should have padded her feet.
STANTZ: I don't think they make Nikes in her size.
VENKMAN: We're almost there, Lib. Step on it.
STANTZ: My Fault!
VENKMAN: She's new in town.
