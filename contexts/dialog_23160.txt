BEN: It's CICI! Cici's the name of the character she plays in the movie!
VOICE: Very good. Now we play ROUND 2.
BEN: What?! But I did everything you said to do!
VOICE: That's right. And you beat ROUND 1. Now we're taking the game to a whole new level. Meet me beneath the Hollywood sign in ten minutes. I'll have your girlfriend. We'll be waiting.
BEN: What?!
VOICE: Good bye Ben.
