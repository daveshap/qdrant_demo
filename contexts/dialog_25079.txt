SCHULTZ: Gentlemen, tomorrow morning the Geneva Man is coming to inspect the camp whether we are living up to the International Convention. I am sure he will find we are treating you very well. You must not run around in your underwear. And take off the wash. The Kommandant wants all the barracks to be spic and also span.
STOSH: We'll put pink ribbons on the bedbugs.
SCHULTZ: The Kommandant also sends you clean blankets. He wants every man to have a new, clean blanket.
HOFFY: We know! We got them last year. Five minutes after the Geneva Man was gone, the blankets were gone.
SCHULTZ: One more thing, gentlemen. The Kommandant told me to pick up the radio.
HOFFY: What radio?
SCHULTZ: The one you are hiding in the barrack, don't you know? The one your friend without the leg is smuggling all over the compound.
PRICE: Schulz, you're off your nut!
SCHULTZ: Give me the radio.
PRICE: We have no radio.
SCHULTZ: All right, gentlemen, I will find it myself. Now let's see.
