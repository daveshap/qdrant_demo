Being poor sucks
Honestly I just came to vent.
Being poor is so embarrassing. Having no money for new shoes and school supplies.I'm a junior in high school and I've had the same shoes since freshmen year.I know I'm lucky to have a roof over my head, and food in my fridge, but I can't help feeling sad when I see holes in my shoes and pants I can't fit.And my anxiety convinces me that everyone laughing and talking about me.anyway it's almost Halloween so I have a reason to live(jk) comment(?) If you relate I just want to talk with somebody I can relate to:)
