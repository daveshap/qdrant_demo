JEAN: Late?
BATEMAN: Aerobics class. Sorry. Any messages?
JEAN: Ricky Hendricks has to cancel today. He didn't say what he was canceling or why.
BATEMAN: I occasionally box with Ricky at the Harvard Club. Anyone else?
JEAN: And...Spencer wants to meet you for a drink at Fluties Pier 17.
BATEMAN: When?
JEAN: After six.
BATEMAN: Negative. Cancel it.
JEAN: Oh? And what should I say?
BATEMAN: Just...say...no.
JEAN: Just say no?
BATEMAN: Okay, Jean. I need reservations for three at Camols at twelve-thirty, and if not there, try Crayons. All right?
JEAN: Yes, sir.
