FRANK: Thou. For Thou art with me. Welcome, welcome, welcome!
DUKE: What the hell's going on here?
FRANK: This is Ho-Jon, my houseboy. Our houseboy. I'm teaching him English.
DUKE: Where's he gonna use that kind of talk? 'The valley of the shadow of death.' Wait a minute, Ho-Jon... I got something for you.
DUKE: Little light reading matter. Just right for his age.
HAWKEYE: Well, southern boy, I suppose you want the sack that's convenient to the door.
DUKE: And gets the wind every time it opens. No, thanks. I'll take that one.
