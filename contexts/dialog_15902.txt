GUMP: Friend Ogg. Excuse our enthusiasm, occasioned as it was by a fondness for you.
OGG: Honeythorn Gump, is it? I've not seen your ugly face since you sold me a jug of cow piss claiming it was dragon's tears.
GUMP: Well, bygones're bygones, I always say.
OGG: Or was it the time you and Jimmy Squarefoot stole the golden apples I'd forged.
GUMP: Twas Jimmy done that, I merely stood for the blame unfairly... but, here now, Ogg, this be no time to rehash old differences, I've friends along in need of safe haven for the night.
OGG: Who might these friends be?
GUMP: Screwball you know, and many other of the wee folk. We serve as escort for our grand champion, Jack o' the Green.
JACK: Honored to make your acquaintance.
OGG: Grand champion, is it? And what great cause leads you to me?
JACK: We seek the ogre, Baron Couer de Noir. He slew a unicorn and plunged the world into eternal winter.
OGG: Thought the weather terrible of late.
GUMP: We seek to undo the curse.
SCREWBALL: Gonna make ogre-stew!
