It can and will happen.
I've not had a relationship in five years.

My last relationship (five years ago) ended in a trainwreck. She cheated on me. I had some pretty deep wounds from it and my love live absolutely suffered.

I felt worthless after she told me what she'd done. I felt like I was not good enough for anyone. I convinced myself I would just die alone.

Because of this, I did not pursue anything for a year. I just couldn't muster up the courage to get back into the chase.

After that year, I started taking shots with women again but for the past four years I've struck out. Time after time I'd been rejected (with the exception of one girl which ultimately did not work out).

But I've kept my head up, and because I haven't quit, I have a budding relationship with a magnificent, talented woman. 

The ONLY reason I have this girl is because I continued to search despite the rejections or failed dates.

Friends: DON'T GIVE UP. I promise you, someone is out there. It can and will happen. I am a testament to that statement. Don't give up.
