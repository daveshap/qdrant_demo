how do i start talking to him again ?
i was very close to this guy friend-wise, until we started talking a lot more. we have many classes together and after talking with him in my classes, i realized that i had a crush. he then told me that he was going to ask me to homecoming but couldn’t because of something that came up. he told me maybe next time and i said i would hold him to it. that day forward, we stopped talking and it’s been very awkward because i see him all the time. i want to start talking again and be able to start getting closer so we could go to the next dance together, but i keep overthinking that i’m doing something wrong. i don’t know what to do :( we’re both very shy and i’ve tried to reach out after we stopped talking but he doesn’t try to interact anymore. he keeps looking at me in class, but we never speak to each other. what do i do ?
