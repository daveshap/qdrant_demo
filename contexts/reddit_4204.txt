Happy with relationships
After an entire of month approaching women in grocery stores, at my university, coffee shops, beaches, book stores, libraries, gym, etc. I’m happy to say that I’m ecstatic with my progress relationship wise. All it took was just MASSIVE action. I’ve gone on various dates and been with multiple amazing women this month. I lay in bed now at night thinking “I can’t believe I did that! Haha” Or I wake up and I see this gorgeous beautiful girl.... and honestly I just wanted to say I’m genuinely happy with my dating life now. I’m happy with my life all round in general.
