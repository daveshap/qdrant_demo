MARTIN: Anyway, that never use to happen. I was always the prodigy. Now I'm just one of the guys.
DR. OATMAN: Maybe some of the discomfort you're feeling is... guilt. Remorse. Over the innocent people you've killed.
MARTIN: If I show up at your door, chances are you did something to bring me there. I don't care about that stuff, anyway.
DR. OATMAN: What stuff?
MARTIN: Morality.
DR. OATMAN: Go to your reunion, Martin. See those people and discover what they mean to you. Try not to kill anybody for a few days, see how you feel.
MARTIN: If I get antsy I'll kill a few small animals.
