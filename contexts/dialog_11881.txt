RACHEL: Jamie, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that. I can go out with Brady tomorrow night. Its no big deal.
JAMIE: But you wanted to go out tonight. It's my fault that you can't.
RACHEL: Well tonight we're going to do something better. We're going to go trick-or-treating.
JAMIE: I don't want to.
RACHEL: It's Halloween. I mean don't you want to get dresses up in a really scary costume and get some candy?
RACHEL: How about this afternoon I pick you up from school and we go get ice cream?
JAMIE: Double scoops?
RACHEL: Double scoops. Now lets get some breakfast.
LOOMIS: Why wasn't I notified?
DR. HOFFMAN: About what?
LOOMIS: You know damn well about what. You let them take it out of here.
DR. HOFFMAN: For Christ sakes. Spare me the speech. I've listened to it for a decade. The fact is that Michael Myers was a federal patient, and a federal prisoner therefore he is subject to federal law.
LOOMIS: We're not talking about any ordinary prisoner Hoffman! We are talking about evil on two legs.
DR. HOFFMAN: I can see this is useless.
LOOMIS: I don't want to have anyone live through that night again.
DR. HOFFMAN: I've said this before. I think your the one who needs medical help.
