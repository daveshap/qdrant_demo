MAX: Got another gun and a stun gun...
MAX: And went to this guy's house in El Monte, and I waited for him.
JACKIE: What do you do when he comes home?
MAX: Shoot him with the stun gun. While he's incapacitated, cuff him, take 'em to County.
JACKIE: You do that?
MAX: That's my job.
JACKIE: Did you do it that night?
MAX: He never came home. But I'm sitting on the couch, in the dark, holding my stun gun and the whole house smells of mildew -- So after a couple hours I think, What am I doing here? Nineteen years of this shit? So I made up my mind
JACKIE: And is that it?
MAX: More or less.
JACKIE: I'm not sure you answered my question.
MAX: Which one?
JACKIE: If you had a chance, unemployed now, to walk off with a half-million dollars, would you take it?
MAX: I believe I said I'd be tempted.
MAX: Don't even think about it. You could get yourself killed go to prison...
JACKIE: What if I've figured a way?
