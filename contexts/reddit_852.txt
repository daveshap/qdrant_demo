Does anyone else get overwhelmed and anxious as soon as they have a responsibility to fulfil (answering a text, an email, etc.)?
I’m going back to law school next week, and a bunch of communication from volunteering groups, clubs, friends, etc. have started up again. I feel like crawling under my covers every time I think about having to schedule a meeting or return a phone call to someone. It hasn’t ever been this bad before. I don’t even want to answer texts from my friends that are back in town, because that means we need to get together. 

Ex: I had to send a mass email to a few organizations to see if they wanted to arrange a presentation with my volunteer group. I’ve already received a voicemail and an email in response. The idea of needing to respond and figure out logistics makes me body turn to stone. I just want to ignore it all and pretend I never heard back from anyone...

Does this happen to anyone else? Do you snap out of it?
