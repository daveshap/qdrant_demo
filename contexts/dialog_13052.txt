MARY: I think I'm going fucking crazy.
DENISE: I can't believe...
BILL: OK, whatever. Let's go get your brother's truck. Faster we get the truck, faster we get out of here.
BABY: OK.
JERRY: I'll go. It's my fault.
MARY: You said it, not me.
BILL: Forget it. I'll just go.
MARY: Screw that, no way, I ain't letting you go by yourself.
BILL: Don't worry, I'll be quick. Just stay here, no sense everybody getting drenched.
JERRY: I agree.
BABY: Yeah, it won't take long and besides you sassy poodle girls will slow us down.
BILL: Don't worry, I'll be right back.
BABY: Come on.
JERRY: Don't forget the flashlight, it's pretty dark out there.
BILL: Thanks.
JERRY: No problem.
