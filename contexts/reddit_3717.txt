I met someone I actually like, and have a mutual connection with, for the first time in almost 5 years.
We’ve only hung out twice so I don’t want to jinx it but I’m excited to see where things go and I needed a place to express this! I have a total crush on this dude and it’s going really well. I know I’m a total dork but thanks for reading this!

EDIT: Someone asked me to provide an update later and so I shall!
