GRADY: I'm so glad to see you, Sara.
SARA: I believe you. Did that nice doctor let you out? Or is this you improvising again, Grady?
GRADY: I'm through improvising.
SARA: Terry told me about Wonder Boys. Is it true? Did you lose it all?
GRADY: I lost it all.
SARA: Oh, Grady. You're such a putz.
GRADY: I know.
SARA: And you're old.
GRADY: Ouch. How many?
SARA: Dozens. It's very sad.
GRADY: I went and looked at some babies just now.
SARA: Oh?
GRADY: I guess you have to go on faith.
SARA: Some times...
GRADY: Did you tell Walter?
SARA: I told Walter.
GRADY: Does he still love you?
SARA: It didn't come up.
