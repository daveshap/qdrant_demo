MRS. FARREN: No, not people -- just deer and game, but the people he catches can never be free again. They too must kill and kill, covering themselves with blood.
EDWARD: It's dark. We'd better be getting on. The family will be waiting.
MRS. FARREN: Such a brief visit, but dear child, it has made my Christmas very merry.
