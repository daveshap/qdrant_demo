You ever feel ashamed of cancelling plans, so you just ghost?
I feel TERRIBLE about this. When I make plans with someone i’m usually excited but when the day and time come to actually show up I retreat into my bubble and go into full panic mode. It’s like i give myself excuses why I can’t/shouldn’t go. And i’m so ashamed to actually cancel I just ghost. I feel ashamed before and after. Sometimes I think it’s easier to be alone all the time just so I don’t have to disappoint anyone.
