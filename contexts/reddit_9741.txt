Leaving a Student Affairs Position to achieve a SA Masters
I have been working in a Student Affairs position for about 3 1/2 years now. I have been planning to leave the position so I can pursue a Masters because I would ultimately like to work in administration for a university (eventually achieving my Doctorate). 

I'm currently making about 52k a year, and probably closer to 60k if you include my travel benefits. 

I can't help but keep questioning if I'm making the right choice. Working with many people in the SA Field, I know that the positions are not well funded toward the bottom and can take a long time to work your way up to a similar salary. 

Am I wrong? Will my years in student affairs work potentially keep me from having to start at the bottom of the totem pole and maybe start toward the middle/bottom?
