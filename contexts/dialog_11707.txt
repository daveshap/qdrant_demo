KERI: No, Will, this isn't the alcohol talking. It's the truth.
WILL: I can't believe this is happening.
KERI: Shit happens.
JOHN: Wait a minute... slow down... you're telling me Michael Meyers is my uncle?
KERI: Yes.
JOHN: Any other psychotic relatives I should know about? Jason? Freddy Krueger?
KERI: No.
JOHN: Why didn't you tell me?
KERI: I was trying to protect you from this...
KERI: Where are you going?
JOHN: I don't know.
WILL: You just dropped a shitload on him... give him some time to digest it.
KERI: Are you going to leave, too?
WILL: Never.
WILL: So you're really Michael Meyers' sister?
KERI: Yeah.
WILL: Do we have to invite him to the wedding?
