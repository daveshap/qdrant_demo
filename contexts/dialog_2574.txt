LT: Christ! Shit! I could kill them all with my bare hands.
ARIANE: Who?
LT: Those fucking Mob assholes.
ARIANE: C'mere. You got some good blow, right?
LT: Yeah.
ARIANE: Then c'mere. I got something for you.
ARIANE: First I'll put your Uptown in the spoon, then, to make it more exciting, I'm gonna add some Downtown. They call this thing a speedball, honey, but then you must know that... First time shooting up?
LT: Nah...
ARIANE: Sure it is. You're a virgin. Just like that nun. And I'm gonna rape you.
LT: Large?
LARGE: All right, cop. I want my money.
LT: It's still my money. If you want to have a chance at any part of it, shithead, you will take my $120,000 and bet on tomorrow's game.
LARGE: What about the money you owe me on yesterday's game?
LT: Fuck yesterday's game. The World Series is seven games not six. Put in my bet.
LARGE: Let me think about it.
LT: There's nothing to think about. Either you put in my bet or you ain't getting nothing.
LARGE: Oh, really?
LT: Yeah, really. I'm no fucking asshole, man. I'm a fucking cop!
LARGE: OK, cop. I want you to give yourself and your friends on the force a message. Tell them I've got my own reasons to be very interested in whomever did the job on the nuns. I'll double the Church reward if you bring those punks direct to me. 100 G cash. Get it?
