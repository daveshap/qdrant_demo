HARRY: Boy, I thought you were about to cross the river.
GIDEON: I tell you, I feel like a ghost.
HARRY: Son, would you do me a favor and see if you could turn off that tap in the bathroom. My hand is too weak. And would you do me another favor? I don't like asking this but would you clean the tub for me? I have trouble bending over.
BABE BROTHER: Anytime you need someone to do something for you, just let me know.
HARRY: That smells like fresh coffee.
SUZIE: Let me get you a cup?
HARRY: Only if you can spare it.
