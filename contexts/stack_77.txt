Question about compatibility of High Sierra (on MBP 2017) w Photoshop Elements 2018 Specifically: Are there certain things I should do on my end (MacBook Pro 2017, High Sierra) so as to avoid crashing Photoshop Elements 2018? Not having a decent photo software on my MBP is driving me crazy and Gimp just doesn't do it for me (subscribing to Photoshop isn't worth it).I've read tons of reviews. For every 5-star glowing review, there is a damning one. PE2018 should be the same upon delivery (download or disc), right? The variable here is the computer environment--which is why I am posting my question here and not on Amazon.Thanks in advance!
