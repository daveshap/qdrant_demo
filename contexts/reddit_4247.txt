When he/she says they’re not ready for a relationship, they mean “not with you”
Those of us who become interested in someone only to find out (hopefully early on) that someone isn’t looking for a relationship, often means “not with you” — they’re waiting for someone better to propose the offer on. 

Think about it, we might interview for a job and they’re looking for the best candidate, why settle on someone who won’t stick around for less than 3-6 months? So they hold out and keep looking for something with longevity, instead of temporary.

But at the same time understand that a lot of people are indecisive and may not end up weigh all their options in the long run, they may come from states of vulnerability or even loneliness. That even you while a viable option, may not be a fit for them not because of who you are, but rather who they are — they may see themselves unworthy of being a partner in their eyes or perhaps breaking your heart in the long run.


As much as it’s a blow to you and your self esteem, understanding this will save you eventual heartbreak down the road. Continue to be the best version of yourself, and work on the things you feel you need to work on.
