Are there any PDF viewing software that allows split view? I'm on 16.04 and would like to view two different sections of the same PDF in the same window. I know it is possible to open several instances of PDF viewer but that's rather annoying.I've tried Foxit, Evince, Okular... and several others. It seems that none of them seem to offer this feature in Ubuntu. A bit of googling suggests Konqueror but I wasn't able to get it to work either...
