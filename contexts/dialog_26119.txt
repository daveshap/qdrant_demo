GENERAL BUCK" SCHMUCK": Well, Mister President.
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY: What kind of trouble?
GENERAL BUCK" SCHMUCK": Well, sir, about forty-six minutes ago one of my base commanders, General Jack D. Ripper, sent out attack orders to the thirty-four B-90's of the 843rd Bomb Wing, under his command.
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY: General Schmuck?
GENERAL BUCK" SCHMUCK": Yes, sir. He issued attack orders to --
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY: May I be stupid enough to inquire WHY IN HELL THE BASE COMMANDER OF THE 843d BOMB WING DID A THING LIKE THAT ???
GENERAL BUCK" SCHMUCK": To be perfectly honest, Mister President, we really aren't sure.
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY: You aren't sure!
GENERAL BUCK" SCHMUCK": Not exactly, sir. You see, Colonel Puntrich at Air Command HQ received a call from him about twenty minutes ago. He asked General Ripper if he had issued the Go-code and the attack order, and General Ripper said: Sure
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY: Damn it! Damn it! I've been telling you all for years you've got too damned many psychoes in the service.
GENERAL BUCK" SCHMUCK": Be fair, Mister President. Didn't we initiate the Human Reliability tests for all personnel handling nuclear weapons?
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY: Buck, when I told you to give them right up to the top, you said we couldn't insult a general officer by asking him to pass a test to see if he's a psycho.
GENERAL SCHMUCK: It was a honest mistake, sir.
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY: I presume the planes are armed?
GENERAL SCHMUCK: I'm afraid so, Mister Presient. Being part of the air-borne alert, each plane is carrying a full load - about fifty megatons apiece.
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY: Well, what about the Positive Control, the safety catch? Don't the planes automatically come back unless they get a second order?
GENERAL SCHMUCK: That's right, sir. But the planes were at their Positive Control points, ready to turn around when General Ripper issued the final Go-code.
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY: And I suppose there's some reason why you haven't recalled them?
GENERAL SCHMUCK: Yes, sir. The base commander, General Ripper, selected Plan-R?
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY: What the hell is Plan-R?
GENERAL SCHMUCK: Well, sir, Plan-R is an emergency plan to be used by lower echelon commanders if higher echelons have been knocked out by a sneak attack.
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY: Why can't you cancel it?
GENERAL SCHMUCK: Once the orders have been given, Plan-R requires any new orders to be received on the CRM-114 in the aircraft. But the CRM-114 will not receive any transmissions unless they are preceded by the proper three-letter code group.
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY: And I suppose you're going to tell me you don't know what the three-letter code is.
GENERAL SCHMUCK: Mister President, to guard against espionage, the three letter of the code group for Plan-R are always selected by the lower echelon commander himself, just before each mission. They are sealed in the various attack plans and are known only to the lower echelon commander and his deputy. In this case the deputy is air-borne with the Wing, and General Ripper refuses to recall the planes.
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY: How soon until the enemy finds out what's going on?
GENERAL SCHMUCK: We estimate the planes should be entering their coastal radar cover in about twenty-five min- utes.
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY: How could you let this happen, General Schmuck?
GENERAL SCHMUCK: Mister President, I know you think I've let you down, but we had to have a Plan-R. If we completely centralized the command and control, all a potential aggressor would have to worry about was knock- ing out maybe half a dozen headquarters and the Capitol, and we'd be out of business. We'd have planes and missiles just sitting there while we were getting clobbered.
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY: Then there's no chance for recall?
GENERAL SCHMUCK: I should say practically none, though we have our communications center plowing through every possible three-letter combination. The trouble is that there are about seventeen thousand permutations, and it will take us approximately four and a half days to go through them all.
