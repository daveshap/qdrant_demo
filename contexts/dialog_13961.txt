MILES: Do you think I'm going to end up like Herb Myerson, with a colostomy bag instead of a family?
KENNETH: Got any symptoms?
MILES: Yes. The inability to experience pleasure.
KENNETH: Oh. That. Don't waste time with your queen.
MILES: What?
KENNETH: The Center Counter Defense. The thing is not to move your queen too early.
MILES: She can't really love that idiot, can she?
KENNETH: What?
MILES: Marylin Rexroth. She came into my office and signed a pre-nup with Howard Doyle.
KENNETH: Doyle Oil? A Massey Pre-nup? She loves him.
MILES: He's the wrong man.
KENNETH: Miles! Don't waste time with someone else's queen, either.
