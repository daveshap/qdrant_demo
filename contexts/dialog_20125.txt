BIG NURSE: We do appreciate the way you have taken it upon yourself to meet the other patients.
MCMURPHY: Thank you, ma'am...
BIG NURSE: This is your bed. You may leave your things in that cabinet.
MCMURPHY: Yes, ma'am...
BIG NURSE: Please use your time to familiarize yourself with your new home and if there is anything you need to know, don't hesitate to ask us.
MCMURPHY: Now that you mention it, I sure would like to call my aunt up in Portland and tell 'er where I am so she can come visit me.
BIG NURSE: All in good time, Mister McMurphy. All in good time.
MCMURPHY: Yes, ma'am.
BIG NURSE: Good. Now if you'll just go along with Mister Washington, he'll see that you're properly oriented.
BIG NURSE: Is there anything else?
MCMURPHY: Just that I'm glad to be here, Miss Ratched. I really am.
BIG NURSE: Good. I'm sure we'll be friends.
MCMURPHY: Yeah, you ain't half so bad looking for a head nurse.
BIG NURSE: Yes. Now go along, Mister McMurphy. Go along.
MCMURPHY: Yes, ma'am. Lead the way, Sam.
