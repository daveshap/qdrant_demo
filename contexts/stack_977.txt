Can't boot normally or into recovery mode (Ubuntu 18.04) I have Ubuntu 18.04 running on my desktop. It has been working fine for months, but crashed today while playing a video game.Now when I try to boot it gets stuck at the purple screen before the ubuntu logo or the login screen. Indeed I can't even boot in recovery mode! When I try to do so it freezes, and there is nothing particularly revealing (as far as I can tell) in the output before it freezes.I can give more hardware/software details if needed. I do have a Nvidia graphics card and running Nvidia drivers, but they have been working perfectly up to this point.Any help greatly appreciated.
