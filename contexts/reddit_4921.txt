My high-5 day:
I finally cleaned my cooktop after months of grossed-out guilt. And I mean I removed all the parts—grates, caps, knobs—to the laundry sink and scrubbed the the living shit out of every nook and cranny. I also did the same level of attention to my toaster oven. This comes after four days of not getting out bed, so I think it’s pretty big.
