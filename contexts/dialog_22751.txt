BECKY: Did you talk to him?
ANNIE: I couldn't do it. How did I get here?
BECKY: You told a lie and got on a plane.
ANNIE: That's not what I mean. I'm going back over there tomorrow and talk to him. I am.
BECKY: Okay. Good. Goodbye.
ANNIE: Becky?
BECKY: What?
ANNIE: Is this crazy?
BECKY: No. That's the weirdest part about it.
ANNIE: Thank you. I love you.
BECKY: I love you, too.
ANNIE: Good night.
SAM: God, it's wonderful to see you. Where's Greg?
SUZY: He's over at the boat show. He'll be by later. It's so beautiful here.
