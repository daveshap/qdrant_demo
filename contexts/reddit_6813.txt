Reaching out to recruiters for coffee on LinkedIn, is this a no-no?
Hey everyone,

  
 What are your thoughts on reaching out to tech recruiters on LinkedIn and asking them out for coffee as a way to learn more about their problems, what they look for in potential hires, and also as a way to network?

  
 My goal is to eventually land a role as an SDR at a tech start-up, but I don't want to come across like Iâ€™m begging for a job. I understand that I should provide value first and would do my research before reaching out.

  
 I'm just wondering if this is something you guys would recommend or if it's a big no-no? And of course, I know many will say no since they're undoubtedly busy, but I figured I would still like to try.

  
 Thank you!
