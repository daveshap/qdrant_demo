DANTE: Did you ever notice all the prices end in nine? Damn, that's eerie.
RANDAL: You know how much money the average jizz-mopper make per hour?
DANTE: What's a jizz-mopper?
RANDAL: He's the guy in those nudie-booth joints who cleans up after each guy that jerks off.
DANTE: Nudie booth?
RANDAL: Nudie booth. You've never been in a nudie booth?
DANTE: I guess not.
RANDAL: Oh, it's great. You step into this little booth and there's this window between you and this naked woman, and she puts on this little show for like ten bucks.
DANTE: What kind of show?
RANDAL: Think of the weirdest, craziest shit you'd like to see chicks do. These chicks do it all. They insert things into any opening in their body... any opening. He's led a very sheltered life.
DANTE: Can we talk about this later?
RANDAL: The jizz-mopper's job is to clean up the booths afterward, because practically everybody shoots a load against the window, and I don't know if you know or not, but cum leaves streaks if you don't clean it right away.
CUSTOMER: This is the last time I come to this place.
DANTE: Excuse me?
CUSTOMER: Using filthy language in front of the customers... you should both get fired.
DANTE: We're sorry, ma'am. We got a little carried away.
CUSTOMER: Well, I don't know if sorry can make up for it. I found your remarks highly offensive.
