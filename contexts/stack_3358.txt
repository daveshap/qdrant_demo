Children's sci-fi collection - Alien orthodontist When I was a child in the 70s I would stay with my grand parents and read children's sci fi.  They had a particular book containing a collection of short stories one of which was about a human guy whose job was to fly around space cleaning the teeth of giant space creatures.  He was so small in comparison to the giant aliens teeth that he was no bigger than their smallest teeth.  Can anyone let me know if they know the story, author or the collection of stories?I would love to find this book again.
