ATHOS: D'Artagnan!
D'ARTAGNAN: Athos, my friend!
D'ARTAGNAN: It's been too long.
ATHOS: Life is too long. Except when we have our friends. Look at you! You're still a boy! Sit, sit! I'll open a bottle of wine.
D'ARTAGNAN: Thanks, but not for me.
ATHOS: You can't drink with a friend you haven't seen in months?
D'ARTAGNAN: I have ordered a drill of the Royal Guard for midnight, and must be clear-headed for it.
ATHOS: Midnight! Mon dieu! Driving the youngsters hard, eh?
D'ARTAGNAN: They must stay sharp. There was an attempt on the King's life today.
ATHOS: Another? How many times have you saved his life in this year alone? Three? Four?
D'ARTAGNAN: I heard your playing.
ATHOS: I was feeling sorry for myself. Raoul is getting married, he proposed today! I love that boy beyond all measure, I've spent everything I own to give him education and opportunity. Now he has complete happiness, and I mope.
