Is Corona virus affecting the job market? & Any excel learning advice?
I’ve been having trouble getting employed. I haven’t received an interview interview since early February and I’m starting to think that employers are going to start being precautious and many will put a hold on hiring.

What are your thoughts?

If this does happen, what should I do meanwhile?

Also: does anyone have any tips/videos recommendations to be proficient at Excel?
