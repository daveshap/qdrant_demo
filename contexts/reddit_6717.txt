If a potential employer says "lets explore opportunities" does that mean they might be interested in hiring me or are they just being polite?
I met this manager 6 months ago (I don't work for him) and I was interested in the job his team does so I asked him if we can meet so that I can learn about what they do. We met and had a great conversation. He told me if I'm ever interested in potentially joining his team I should email him. So fast forward 6 months later, my current contract at my current job is ending and I'm looking for a new job. I email this manager and say a bunch of things as well as re-send my resume just in case he lost it and finished the email with "I would love to chat and learn about potential opportunities on your team" and he said hes happy I reached out and he wants to do a meeting with me, him and another manager and THEN we can explore opportunities.

Does his response seem like he might have a job in mind for me? or is this just a way to be polite? Mainly I just want to know if that type of response is usually considered positive or neutral. I'm getting a little stressed that I won't find a new job

thanks for any answers
