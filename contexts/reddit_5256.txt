Anxious about starting a new job after a long time not working/long spell of depression
Tomorrow I start a new job and I'm really scared. I haven't worked in a year and for that year I've been dealing with severe depression. 

It's a pretty menial position, without much real responsibility, just a administrative assistant job at a neurology office. 

I'm worried that I'll screw everything up and get fired or I'll have some kind of episode and start crying in the middle of an office. I haven't had a schedule or responsibility for a long time. I'm scared I won't be able to adapt quickly enough.  I'm still severely depressed and worried my symptoms will get in the way of work. 

What can I do to calm down and prepare myself for tomorrow?
