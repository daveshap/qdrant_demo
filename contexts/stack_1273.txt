How to mount TV to basement wall under stairs? I have a 55\" TV I'd like to mount on a basement wall, which is located under the stairs. The area under the stairs is actually accessible, and I've gone back there to see what's available. It looks like there are studs there, but they're only 2 1/4\" x 1 1/2\"?

Sorry if this is an easy question, I'm a complete novice at this. Edit: some more photos.Here's the front of the wall:Here's some better pics of the back of the wall:
