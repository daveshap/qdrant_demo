MADELEINE: It's not fair, it's too late. It wasn't supposed to happen this way, it shouldn't have happened...!
SCOTTIE: It had to. We're in love. That's all that counts. Madeleine --
MADELEINE: Let me go! Let me go!!
SCOTTIE: Madeleine!!
MADELEINE: You believe that I love you?
SCOTTIE: Yes.
MADELEINE: And if you lose me, you'll know that I loved you and wanted to go on loving you.
SCOTTIE: I won't lose you.
MADELEINE: Let me go into the church alone.
SCOTTIE: Why?
MADELEINE: Please. Because I love you. He stares at her, sees the pleading look in her eyes, and lets go. She turns and walks away toward the church, slowly, her head bowed. He watches her go and starts to move after her. Then slowly, as she goes, her head begins to go up until finally, as she walks, she is staring high above her. And then, suddenly, she breaks into a broken run.
