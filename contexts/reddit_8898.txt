How much does it cost to cover someone under the ACA vs. the newly proposed health care law?
[According to the latest CBO report](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/cbo-latest-house-gop-health-care-bill-would-mean-as-many-uninsured-by-2026/2017/03/23/cb507fce-0f4d-11e7-ab07-07d9f521f6b5_story.html), the ACA repeal will cut the federal deficit by $150 billion over 10 years and cause 24 million more Americans to be uninsured.

Some simple calculations:

$150 billion over 10 years = $15 billion per year

$15 billion / 24 million uninsured = $625 saved per person per year

Obviously this is an estimate. But supposing that it's at least roughly correct, can this be interpreted as saying that it would cost the US government $625 to insure one of those individuals for a year? This strikes me as relatively cheap, considering that [monthly premiums are roughly $393 for individuals](https://www.zanebenefits.com/blog/bid/97380/faq-how-much-does-individual-health-insurance-cost) -- so cheap that I think my line of reasoning must be flawed.

Of course, this is assuming that everyone who loses insurance was previously getting it at no cost (to them) through Medicaid. This doesn't seem like a stretch considering that [tens of millions of people are enrolled in it](https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/02/24/medicaid-enrollment-surges-across-the-us).

I'm aware this isn't a very nuanced analysis, but I still feel like I must be overlooking something crucial.

Thanks for any insight!
