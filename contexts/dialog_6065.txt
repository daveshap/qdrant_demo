KANE: It does seem too good to be true, doesn't it, Mr. Bernstein?
REILLY: Rogers isn't even pretending. He isn't just scared anymore. He's sick. Frank Norris told me last night he hasn't known Rogers to be that worried in twenty-five years.
KANE: I think it's beginning to dawn on Mr. Rogers that I mean what I say. With Mr. Rogers out of the way, Reilly, I think we may really begin to hope for a good government in this state. Well, Mr. Bernstein?
BERNSTEIN: It's wonderful, Mr. Kane. Wonderful. Wonderful.
KANE: You don't really think so?
BERNSTEIN: I do. I do. I mean, since you're running for Governor - and you want to be elected - I think it's wonderful you're going to be elected. Only - - Can I say something?
KANE: Please, Mr. Bernstein.
BERNSTEIN: Well, the way I look at it - - You want to know what I really think would be wonderful?
