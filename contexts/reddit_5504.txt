Need advice; fully qualified but missing degree
Hey all, currently in college for Graphic Design. When I started college, I went part time during the first year due to health issues. As a result, I was unable to take a design history course second semester. Second year rolls around, do great and finish it full time, but I was unable to take the history course for due to a course conflict. Third year same issue. Now I am in my final year and  semester, about to finish my last coop and, yet again, I can’t take the course due to a schedule conflict with another course.

Now mind you this design history course is mandatory, in only one slot, and can only be taken at a specific time once per year. Without it I cannot graduate. Other option was to find an equivalency at another college, had tons of options but none of them got approved. Didn’t meet my colleges criteria. My only option is to wait until 2021 to take it again after speaking to the program coordinator, academic advisor and program chair.

So in April I will have a fully completed portfolio from school, some experience outside of school under my belt, every course completed but one, fully qualified, but no degree. Will I be able to be hired as a full time employee, should I explain my situation? What are the best steps I can take to get hired? 

Much thanks!

Tl;dr: Completed every course for my Graphic Design degree except a single design history course. Can only take it next year, can’t graduate until then. Fully qualified otherwise, what steps should I take, and will I be hireable?
