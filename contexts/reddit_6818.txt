Concerns about a Recruiter
Yesterday I received a message on LinkedIn saying that I would be an ideal candidate for a position that I was very much interested in. The recruiter asked to set up a time to talk the same day, so I immediately responded and said when I would be available. We spoke for about 10 minutes and everything seemed to go great! Because the position was a contract to hire, he said he would email me the full job description as well as the benefits that his company would offer while I was under the contract period prior to moving to be a full time employee as soon as we hung up. He also explicitly stated to text or call him once I reviewed the information if I wanted to move forward as this was his personal number.

About two and a half hours go by with no email so I decide to text him saying:

"Hello,
This is [me], I am so sorry to bother you, I just haven't received any information via e-mail yet and wanted to check in with you. Thank you!"

About 30 minutes later he says:
"Sorry, I'll send that information over right now. My apologies!"

Another 30 minutes go by and I finally receive a message on LinkedIn with him apologizing for "forgetting" and including ONLY the job description and no benefits. Feeling frustrated, but not wanting to blow this opportunity, I respond by saying thank you for sending the information; attached my resume; and said that I am interested in moving forward and would also like to view the benefits if possible as I didn't seem to receive that attachment.

I have yet to hear anything back and I'm just feeling so confused! Did I do something wrong here?
