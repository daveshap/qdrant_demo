EAGLEFOOT: The family has gone through a lot. Their daughter missing, the search, her body found, the funeral -- then this order to exhume the corpse.
MACKELWAY: I'm sorry. This won't take long.
EAGLEFOOT: The body was embalmed. I don't understand --
MACKELWAY: Turn the body over. There was something in the autopsy report, yes, here. These burn marks.
EAGLEFOOT: A grill pattern.
MACKELWAY: We need to run this through VICAP, search for similar burns.
