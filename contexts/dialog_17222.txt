LIEUTENANT DISH: Isn't this ridiculous, Doctor? Six months I've been here and there are still times when I can't stand it. I just go to pieces.
HAWKEYE: There's nothing ridiculous about it. A kid like you...
LIEUTENANT DISH: Thank you, Captain Pierce. It's been so long.
HAWKEYE: No trouble at all. Hawkeye.
LIEUTENANT DISH: How did you get called that?
HAWKEYE: 'The Last of the Mohicans.' Only book my father ever read.
LIEUTENANT DISH: You're getting a workout, you and Captain Forrest, your first night.
HAWKEYE: It isn't always this rough?
LIEUTENANT DISH: Oh, no. We have dull stretches every week or so, thank God, when there's nothing to do after midnight.
HAWKEYE: They don't have to be dull. I mean if you and me put our minds together...
LIEUTENANT DISH: Our minds?
HAWKEYE: For a start. I just have a hunch... well, it isn't entirely a hunch...
LIEUTENANT DISH: You're an attractive man.
HAWKEYE: You have a certain modest charm yourself.
LIEUTENANT DISH: But I'm married.
HAWKEYE: Something else we have in common.
LIEUTENANT DISH: Very happily married.
HAWKEYE: Same here.
LIEUTENANT DISH: And absolutely determined to be faithful to my husband. Do we have that in common, Captain?
HAWKEYE: It's a matter of definition. Faithful in spirit, yes.
LIEUTENANT DISH: I don't make the distinction. But the sex urge is a powerful force. In women just as much as men.
HAWKEYE: Ayuh.
LIEUTENANT DISH: You'd think now, with only six weeks before they ship me back home, it would be easier. But it isn't.
HAWKEYE: Of course not.
LIEUTENANT DISH: It's terribly hard. Sometimes the temptation is just too much.
HAWKEYE: Then why not, as long as it wouldn't hurt anybody...?
LIEUTENANT DISH: But you've made me feel strong again, Captain. Hawkeye. You helped me pull together when I needed it.
DUKE: Now that's what I call real pretty. We can close up here and go into his belly.
HAWKEYE: He can't take much more time on the table.
DUKE: So we got to cut him fast. I figure from the X-ray it ain't just the spleen. We also got to snatch his right kidney.
