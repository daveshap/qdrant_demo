The biggest lie I have ever been told was that you should treat others the way you’d want to be treated.
People will treat you like shit regardless. You can give your best to people and they will still treat you how they want to. I am done trying to be good to people who aren’t good to me. The funny part is after it’s all said and done, you will still feel like the bad guy even though you weren’t in that situation. I just don’t care enough to live in a world that doesn’t care about me.
