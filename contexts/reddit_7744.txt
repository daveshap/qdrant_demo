Website to look for open phd position in pure mathematics.
I am planning to apply to US and Europe for pure maths phd. 

How to look for open phd position in Europe(In US, I just have to apply to department). Are there some good websites?

 One option is that I individually go to each univ website and look for vacancy but that is too tiresome. Other option is to directly mail to people in your interest area. I have tried this but I got no positve response. 

Please help.
