Is a master's worth it without full funding?
I would prefer to go to a school where my master's would be fully funded, but so far in my search, I've only found one (UConn HESA). The other programs I've looked at have potential, but either they offer no tuition support or provide "modest" support. I've also seen schools that offer a nine-credit tuition waiver with an assistantship, but I'm not sure that will be enough for me. I looked at Michigan State, as they offer a nine-credit tuition waiver, when most grad students take 10 credits a semester. That's the next best I got.

I get the idea that you shouldn't end up in debt for this degree, and I hesitate to go into a program knowing I may still have to take out loans. Am I on the right track by only looking at fully funded programs? I am willing to relocate, but it feels like I would just end up forking out a ton of money for a master's in an overcrowded field with mixed career potential.
