THE MARQUIS: Virgin birth -- ha! An entire religion, built on an oxymoron!
COULMIER: Orvolle. His wine. From now on, nothing but water at every meal --
THE MARQUIS: -- water! --
COULMIER: -- and your meat shall be de-boned.
THE MARQUIS: WHY THIS SUDDEN TORTURE?
COULMIER: Because your writing continues, unchecked.
THE MARQUIS: I DIDN'T CREATE THIS WORLD OF OURS! I ONLY RECORD IT!
COULMIER: Its horrors, perhaps! Its darkest nightmares! And to what end? Nothing but your own morbid gratification --
THE MARQUIS: Morbid gratification? NO! I write what I've seen; the endless procession to the chopping block. We're all lined up at the guillotine, waiting for the crunch of the blade. Rivers of blood are flowing beneath our feet, Abbe.
