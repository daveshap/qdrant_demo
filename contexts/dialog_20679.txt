PEGGY: What do you mean you and my father decided? Who the hell are you to plan my life? Let's get married and live happily ever after. Bullshit. I got knocked up. I had to marry you. I never had a choice.
CHARLIE: What?
PEGGY: You betrayed me, Charlie. You were never there for me or the children. And now you come and tell me, Peggy
CHARLIE: You're crazy! You're really out of your mind!
PEGGY: I might be crazy, but I'm not crazy enough to marry you twice. There's a lot of things I can't change. I can't even think about them. I tried. But I couldn't even help Rosalie. I don't want to be bitter. I'm a naturally optimistic person. But you took advantage of that.
