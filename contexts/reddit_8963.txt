Is the monitoring of your cell phone legal? Does the Fourth Amendment (Search and Seizure) protect your right to privacy? When should your privacy rights be limited?

[SCOTUS ON PHONE PRIVACY CASE](http://thehill.com/policy/technology/overnights/362450-overnight-tech-scotus-considers-phone-tracking-apples-new)

"Members of the Supreme Court appeared troubled Wednesday that police can search cellphone location histories without a warrant, but struggled with where the line should be drawn on privacy in the digital age… Carpenter says the FBI violated his Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable search and seizure by obtaining a history of his cellphone location data without a warrant from his wireless carriers, MetroPCS and Sprint. The government then used that information at trial to convict him…   The standard is higher to obtain a warrant, with law enforcement officers required to show there is probable cause to believe a crime has occurred."

"On Wednesday, the Supreme Court heard what could become the most important electronic-privacy case of the 21st century. The justices considered whether the government, without a warrant, can effectively trace our movements in public for months on end by demanding 127 days of the geolocational data—known as cell-site location information—that mobile phones beam out 24 hours a day. During the argument, it was encouraging to see two justices with very different perspectives—Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Neil Gorsuch—make passionate arguments for why allowing these kinds of mass searches of our digital effects would be as invasive and unreasonable as the hated general warrants that helped spark the American Revolution. It’s possible, therefore, that Carpenter v. United States may continue a welcome recent trend: Liberal and conservative justices on the Court, by broad bipartisan margins, are insisting on translating the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution into the digital age.

Justice Elena Kagan framed the stakes in the case by asking Michael Dreeben, the deputy solicitor general, how this case was different from United States v. Jones, a 2012 case where the government tracked a suspect for a month without a warrant by clamping a Global Positioning System device on the bottom of his car. Five justices, led by Justice Antonin Scalia, said that the police violated the suspect’s property rights by committing a physical trespass for the purpose of collecting information—they walked onto his driveway and physically seized his car… Dreeben responded that the Jones case involved government surveillance in public, while in this case, the government was seizing business records that individuals had voluntarily turned over to their third-party cellphone carriers, who stored them in the digital cloud. A 1979 case called Smith v. Maryland held that individuals have no expectation of privacy in the telephone numbers they voluntarily surrender to third parties, establishing what is now known as the third-party doctrine."

"Given these ambiguities, with respect to evidence in criminal investigations CSLI is often far more useful as an exculpatory mechanism than as a mechanism to establish guilt. After all, CSLI can help show that a suspect was dozens or hundreds of miles away from a crime scene. But it can’t generally establish that a suspect was actually at a crime scene. Even in the case where the suspect was actually in the building of interest when a crime occurred, CSLI can at best help show that the suspect, as well as perhaps thousands of other people, was within a few miles, or a half a mile, or a few hundred yards (the precision depends on the size of the area served by the base station in question) of the crime scene… CSLI provides only a very approximate estimate of the actual location of the phone. For example, it might be possible to know that the phone is within a mile or two of a particular base station, but that wouldn’t be enough to place the phone in a particular building, on a particular street, or even in a particular neighborhood. On the other hand, if the mobile phone happens to be connected to a base station that serves a much smaller area, that would provide correspondingly more accurate location information."
