CHANG: Doctor McCoy, what is your current medical status?
BONES: Aside from a touch of arthritis, I'd say pretty good.
BONES: For 27 years I have been Ship's Surgeon and later Chief Medical Officer aboard the USS Enterprise. In three months I'm due to stand down.
CHANG: Stand...?
BONES: Retire.
CHANG: Ah. I believe you also consumed Romulan ale at the officers' mess on the night of question, Doctor?
