STEVE: What?
DAVID: Your manner.
STEVE: My manner? Why don't you go downstairs, get a cup of coffee and calm down? What's the matter, Emmi? What's going on with you? What's wrong?
EMMI: I'm sorry but I have to leave. I'll find other work. You'll have to get someone else, that's all.
STEVE: What is this, Emmi?
EMMI: I can't do this. It's not right.
STEVE: What's not right?
EMMI: I have been questioned by the Gestapo just like that. Just like you questioned him.
STEVE: Emmi, stop! I want to show you something. Let me show you something and then if you want to leave, you can leave, please please. His friends, they did this. And he gave them birthday concerts.
EMMI: But he had no idea, a lot of people had no idea. I only realised what was really going on when I got arrested.
STEVE: If he had no idea, why did the Jews need saving? This is the question, Emmi, to all Germans: Why did the Jews need saving in this country? Why, if people had no idea?
EMMI: I would like to go now, please.
DAVID: Can I ask you a favour, Major?
STEVE: Yeah.
DAVID: When you question him again, could you treat him with more respect?
STEVE: With more what? More what?
DAVID: Major, he may just be the greatest conductor of this century and that merits respect.
STEVE: David, I don't understand a thing about you. You're a Jew. Are you a Jew?
DAVID: Yes, I'm a Jew. But I like to think first I'm a human being.
STEVE: A human being, oh, good, I'm relieved, I thought you were going to say you were a music lover. This man, this great artist has made anti-Semitic remarks like you wouldn't believe. I got letters.
DAVID: Major, show me someone who hasn't made an anti-Semitic remark and I'll show you the gates of paradise.
STEVE: What is it with you, David? Where are your feelings? Where's your hatred, your disgust? Where's your fucking outrage, David?
