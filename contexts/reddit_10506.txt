Failed 20 years ago, about to give it another try
I was depressed 20 years ago, OD'd and was found by my roommate, 20 years later and I live alone, have more effective means and while not depressed, I just dont care anymore.  I was sad then, Im numb now and nothing has changed other than the fact that I could die and nobody will look for me until I bills stop getting paid (how fucked is that?)  Not looking for help, just writing it down for people to see that it doesnt always get better and sometimes is gets worse.
