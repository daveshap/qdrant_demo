HAROLD: This is man to man.
WOODLY: It's healer to killer. Is that the same thing?
HAROLD: What brought you back?
WOODLY: The same hairy, humorless old gods who move you from hither to yon. Honor
HAROLD: He's a champion after all. WOODLY Of the corpses and cripples you create for our instruction--when all we can learn from them is this: how cruel you are.
PENELOPE: This is suicide. Go get the police.
HAROLD: Stop!
HAROLD: There's going to be no bloodshed here. I know how he'll fight--the only way he can fight: with words. The truth. Am I correct?
WOODLY: Yes.
HAROLD: I can defeat him with anything from flavored toothpicks to siege howitzers. But he got it into his little head that he could come here and demolish Harold Ryan with words. The truth! Correct?
WOODLY: Correct.
HAROLD: What an hallucination! Oh, dear, dear, dear, dear. Oh dearie me.
WOODLY: You haven't heard me yet.
HAROLD: You intend to crack my eardrums with your voice? Will I bleed from my every orifice? Who will clean up this awful mess?
WOODLY: We'll find out now, won't we?
PENELOPE: No, we won't. No matter how it begins, it will end in death. Because it always does. Isn't that always how it ends, Harold--in death?
HAROLD: There has to be a threat of some sort, nobility of some sort, glamour of some sort, sport of some sort. These elements are lacking.
WOODLY: You're a filthy, rotten bastard.
HAROLD: Oooooo. That hurt.
WOODLY: You're old--so old.
HAROLD: Now who's being cruel?
WOODLY: A living fossil! Like the cockroaches and the horseshoe crabs.
HAROLD: We do survive, don't we? You're going to have to apologize, of course, for calling me a bastard. That's a matter of form--not allowing you or anybody to call me a bastard. No rush about that. Just remember to apologize sometime soon.
WOODLY: You're a son of a bitch.
HAROLD: Yes--well--uh--that's another one of those statements which more or less automatically requires an apology. Whenever you feel like it. It's sort of like turning off an alarm clock that's ringing loudly. Your apology turns off the alarm.
PENELOPE: I'm turning off the alarm. I'm turning off everything.
HAROLD: Ah! The lady is armed.
PENELOPE: I want you to get out of here, Norbert. Harold--I want you to sit down in the chair, and not lift a finger until Norbert is gone.
HAROLD: Whoever has the gun, you see, gets to tell everybody else exactly what to do. It's the American way.
PENELOPE: I mean it!
HAROLD: Then you'd better fix your bayonet, because there aren't any bullets in the gun.
PENELOPE: Where's the bullet?
HAROLD: Help your mother find the bullet.
PENELOPE: There it is. Give it to me.
PENELOPE: How do I load?
HAROLD: Load it for her.
