What is the constitutionality of so-called "Red Flag" laws in the United States?
After the [mass shootings in Texas and Ohio](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/04/mass-shootings-el-paso-texas-dayton-ohio), the debate on gun control policy has once again resurfaced in the public purview. 

In Ohio, Gov. Mike DeWine [has pushed for the passage](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/06/us/ohio-texas-red-flag-gun-policy.html) of a so-called "Red Flag" law. These are "[state laws that authorize courts to issue a special type of protection order, allowing the police to temporarily confiscate firearms from people who are deemed by a judge to be a danger to themselves or to others.](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/06/us/red-flag-laws.html)" An example of a state with a current Red Flag law is [Oregon](https://www.doj.state.or.us/crime-victims/victims-resources/other-resources/oregons-red-flag-law/): 

>Oregon’s Red Flag law requires a fairly simple process. The first step is for a concerned family member, household member, or law enforcement officer to ask the court for an Extreme Risk Protection Order (ERPO), which will remove a weapon, or a concealed handgun license, from an individual who is at risk for suicide or is a danger to others. An Order also prevents the person from buying additional guns for a one year period. The law is nicknamed “Red Flag Law” for when a person exhibits a ‘red flag’ or other indicator that they may be a harm to themselves, or others. It is one of the few tools that family and household members have to quickly remove a weapon from somebody who is at risk. 

Other states include [Florida](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/florida-red-flag-law-passed-after-parkland-has-saved-lives-advocates-say/) and [Maryland](https://www.baltimoresun.com/politics/bs-md-red-flag-update-20190115-story.html). However, there has been [some](https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/08/red-flag-laws-are-the-wrong-solution-to-mass-shootings/) [issues](https://mises.org/power-market/red-flag-laws-latest-anti-gun-scheme) raised regarding these laws. 

How do these laws interact with the Constitutional right to bear arms and to avail of due process?
