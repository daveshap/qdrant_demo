Can't log in normally or through tty after changing Nvidia Graphics Card I switched from a 1070GTX to a 1080TI a week ago. And while I did all the steps necessary for the switch on Windows, I forgot to do anything on my Ubuntu partition.I tried to log in today and well I couldn't. I got a black screen. I tried to log in to tty1-7 and while I was able to get the login prompt there the computer didn't take inputs after that.I then tried again in recovery mode GRUB->ADVANCED OPTIONS->UBUNTU 16.XXX (Recovery).I went through the resume boot option and the same thing happened.I tried the Graphics Failsafe Mode or something like that and I got a screen with messages scattered, the last of these was something like \"Nvidia Persistence Daemon STOPPED\". It was unresponsive though and I couldn't get into a tty log in prompt.I don't know where to go from here. I'm ok with nuking the system since I'm upgrading motherboard/cpu in a week or two, but I have data in there that I'd like to rescue from the low orbit attack I'll be doing. I can still log into windows but I can't rescue anything in the User folder for some reason. I think it's possibly encrypted.In any case, any help would be appreciated.
