HAMMER: Wait! Before we enter, you need to know that my research has determined that Santa's compound is wired with the XP 2000 stereo type alarm system.
MOHAMMED: A stereo type alarm system?
HAMMER: Take a look.
MOHAMMED: How do we bypass it?
HAMMER: The alarm will trigger if the system detects any Non-W.A.S.P. tendencies inside the building. For example, if you were to dribble a basketball, or eat watermelon, or use the word dawg...that is, spelled with an aw as opposed to the letter o...within the confines of this workshop, the alarm would sound.
MOHAMMED: Listen cat, I'll have you know that I hate the taste of watermelon and am a terrible basketball player.
HAMMER: Well that's good news for us. It means the system is outdated. This should be easy. C'mon.
