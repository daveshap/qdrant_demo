Girl I’ve been messaging on tinder just asked to change our date tonight to attending a BLM rally
Just sharing a cool experience. I’ve been planning to go climbing with this girl for about a week. She seems pretty cool and I was moderately excited (about as excited as I generally get for a tinder date with a girl I haven’t met yet). Then she asked if we could go to the rally instead, and now I’m actually stoked! 

I’ve been on a lot of dates with girls who didn’t seem passionate about anything. This is an exciting change!

Edit: I’m definitely going. I’d planned to swing by before climbing tonight anyway, but this is a unique and exciting opportunity.

Edit edit: appreciate all the safety advice, but we live in a small mountain town far from bigger cities so I’m not worried about the event getting out of hand. In any case, the rally is actually taking place in a park two blocks from my house.

Final edit: it was good! The rally was peaceful and the only unsavory characters were a handful of white supremacists with guns (and individually more or less chins than average) who tried to intimidate marchers from a street corner. We’re going climbing next week.
