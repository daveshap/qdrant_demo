How do I know I’ve been temporarily laid off or actually fired? Haven’t gotten any word...
(Reposting with a better title)

I’m (21F) digital press operator who has been working on and off full time and part time due to college. I’ve been at the company for a little close to 3 years.

A few weeks ago in March I was called by an employee I’m close to and was told “not to come in until you hear otherwise”. My coworker who I worked with is still working (she’s full time) and we had someone new to basically cover for me when I wasn’t around due to class (she is also considered full time). I’m currently in school still and have been doing my class work from home.

My question is how can I know I haven’t been fired? I plan on quitting after college in June but I just want to know if I still have my position at the company for the time being when things clear up.

I haven’t filed for unemployment in PA yet since my schedule has been me bending backwards for school but it is on my list of things to accomplish. I did receive an email from my boss (one sent to every employee in response to the virus).
