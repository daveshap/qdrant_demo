BOYD: Everybody shut up. LISTEN TO ME!
BOYD: Listen to me. Please. Everybody just calm down a bit here. Okay... First...are we sure she's dead?
ADAM: Her head's bashed in and her heart isn't beating.
MOORE: She's dead.
MICHEAL: It was an accident!
BOYD: Are you sure this was an accident?
ADAM: You're a lying deviant. What did you do?!
MICHEAL: The floor was wet. She slipped!
ADAM: Why was the floor wet?
MICHEAL: I don't know why the floor was wet!
ADAM: Why?!
BOYD: Stop it! Listen to me. Let's just take a second here and take hold of the situation, OK? Let's just review our options here.
ADAM: We have a dead woman bleeding all over the bathroom. What options? Call the police.
BOYD: Call the police. Okay, that's one option.
ADAM: That is not an option." There is no multiple choice here."
BOYD: Yes sir, there sure is an option here. There are always options.
