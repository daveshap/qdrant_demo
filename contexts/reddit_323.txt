UPDATE on my post from a few months ago.
Okay so this year her and I don’t have any classes together but things are going great. I am a little nervous that she’s gonna get close with other guys, homecoming is right around the corner and her friends said I should ask her but she has said even if someone was to ask her she would reject them BUT today she said she was with her friends and she said everyone has gotten asked but her(talk about mixed signals) and she only sent that to me. I am confused what to do, I think I’m going to ask her at the football game this upcoming Friday, what do you guys think I should do?
