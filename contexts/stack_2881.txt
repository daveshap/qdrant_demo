How exactly does nuclear reactor work in generating energy, when the energy created from fission transformed into binding energy? I asked this question because I'm a bit confused about the concept of binding energy.From my understanding, in a nuclear reactor, Uranium-235 atoms are bombarded with neutrons so that fission reactions occur. The products of the reaction has a total mass that is less than the reactants' total mass (Uranium-235 and a neutron) and thus there is a mass defect and this mass defect has transformed into the binding energy in the products by Einsteins equation E=mc^2If the mass defect turned into binding energy, and binding energy refers to the energy used to keep the nucleons of an atom or together,  then how is energy generated in a nuclear reactor for human consumption?Shouldn't the mass defect be instead transformed into heat energy to create steam to drive the turbines in the nuclear reactor to generate electricity for human consumption?
