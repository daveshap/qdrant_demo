“Most people overestimate what they can do in one year and underestimate what they can do in ten years.” Bill Gates said it. Can you commit to being supportive to this community?
When I hear people on this sub telling others:

* Get used to the grind
* You're not supposed to like your job
* Just appreciate the situation that you're in, some people don't even have a job!
* Hey, that's just how it is - when you're 35/40/45, you get used to it

It hurts me so much that people are spreading this message. It's not the truth. If you aren't happy with your job, don't make that sadness/resignation someone else's reality. 

If you didn't know the story of the 50 year old architect... 

>A woman had lived her life wanting to be an architect but never having the means to do it. At 40, she finally did. Those around her told her "It's going to take you 10 years to become an architect with the amount of time you can afford to commit to school." She knew it would take her a long time, but she also knew that (God willing) the ten years was going to pass anyway, and at the end of those ten years, she would be an architect or not.

In ten years you are going to be \*fill-in-the-blank\* or not, so what's your plan? 

Some of us have those 10 years. Whether it's you or I that doesn't, let's prop people up and support their dreams. If you see this, can you commit to that support?

We all need it.
