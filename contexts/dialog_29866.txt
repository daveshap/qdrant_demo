DESMOND: Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special Agent Chet Desmond and Agent Sam Stanley. Sorry to disturb you, but we would like to see Teresa Banks' trailer, please.
CARL: More popular than Uncle's Day at a whorehouse. GOD DAMN, THAT MORNING SUN IS BRIGHT! BLUE BRIGHT.
CARL: Mrs. Simmons owns the trailer and she lives in town. Teresa rented it about a month ago.
DESMOND: Did she have someone with her?
CARL: Right. She had a friend with her. The friend took off.
DESMOND: Was there an argument?
CARL: Not that I know of. But arguments do happen, don't they?
DESMOND: Yes they do. Did she have visitors?
CARL: No, hey, I already told this whole damn thing to Sheriff Not-Quite- Able"... Here's the trailer now."
