ANNE MARIE: Did you catch Corbett?
ERIC: Sure did. He was one of the trappers we rousted from the Haul Road.
ANNE MARIE: Was there any trouble?
ERIC: He was sitting in a hot tub with a hooker.
ANNE MARIE: Going after killers isn't the same as chasing poachers, Eric.
ERIC: Can't help myself. Corbett's type always pisses me off. Oh, I found this at the post office. Had your name on it.
