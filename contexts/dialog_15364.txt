YURILIVICH: Hello, Peter. You played an interesting game last night. Even though sacrificing your Queen at b-5 is the game I played against Valsney in '82. I'm glad it helped you.
PETER: I'm sure you are.
YURILIVICH: No, I want you to do good. That way when I beat you at the end I'll look that much better.
PETER: You're getting sloppy, Yurilivich. You're nervous?
YURILIVICH: I'm not nervous.
PETER: Well, you should be, because this time I'm going to win.
YURILIVICH: Well, then this time you'll have to stay for the whole match, won't you?
PETER: Who told you that?
ERICA: Mrs. Lutz. She also told me that Mr. Lutz goes to a medium to try and contact great Grandmasters in the spirit world.
PETER: Has he gotten through to any?
ERICA: No, but he did contact a dead parcheesi champion from Ohio.
