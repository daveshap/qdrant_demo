YOUNG MAN: You quittin' too?
EDDIE: You're a pretty good player.
YOUNG MAN: How much are you ahead?
EDDIE: Couple of bucks.
YOUNG MAN: I guess it's just you and me, huh?
EDDIE: Yeah, I guess it is, boy. Just you and me.
YOUNG MAN: You wanna raise the bet? Two on the five, five on the nine?
EDDIE: You know what, kid? I think maybe you're a hustler.
YOUNG MAN: Try me.
EDDIE: Shoot.
YOUNG MAN: Okay.
YOUNG MAN: You sure you don't want to quit, friend?
EDDIE: Let's cut out the small stuff, huh? Hundred dollar freeze-out. Ten games, ten bucks a game, winner take all. And then we'll see who quits.
YOUNG MAN: Okay, friend. You're on.
EDDIE: Call it.
YOUNG MAN: Heads.
