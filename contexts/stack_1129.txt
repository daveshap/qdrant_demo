SQL Server 2016 Primary and Backup We have a new production box with two SQL servers,SQL Server 2016 Standard edition.The current plan is to have:One primary SQL serverBackup SQL server:only SQL Report server,which points to primary server.Can you please suggest any good replication strategy to move data from primary to back up server and which does not use Single User mode.Realtime replication is expected.In primary server lots of insert/update happens and will be online 24/7.New into Replication.Only one database in Primary SQL server,have to replicate the same db tables/views/triggers etc  into Backup server.Have done some research on replication(Snapshot,Transaction,Merge),but i am not sure about the Single User mode thing in this context.
