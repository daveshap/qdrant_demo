Haven't touched my masters thesis in 10 months - 40% done, feel like it isn't worth it.
I have autism, I will never be able to hold down a normal job. Doing this will purely be for prestige, I'm having a lot of luck with streaming lately, and might be able to turn that into a full time career (literally just had a sponsored stream that paid more money in 2 hours than I've been able to make in a week). 

I could probably do 4 days streaming, 3 days working but I just don't know. Trying to remember things from 2 years ago/10 months ago/figure where I'm going it seems like such a massive headache. 

Has anyone else been in this position? Is it worth it?
