LPT: Check your bank statement every morning, round down to the nearest $10 and transfer that money into savings or debt.
This one has been very helpful for me. On more than one occasion I was able to spot fraudulent charges on my debit card immediately. It has helped me in making faster debt repayments and start building an emergency fund. My spending behavior has also change as a result of this, everything now costs at least $10. 


Edit:


* It doesn't have to be $10. You can round down to the nearest $5, $1 or $0.50. (Sorry for sounding like the rich asshole with more than $10 in my account.)


* If you have a checking and savings account with the same bank transfer should be free.


* There are apps that do this automatically for you, but checking manually everyday makes it easier to spot charges you didn't make, subscriptions you forgot you were paying and keeping you aware of your financial standing.
