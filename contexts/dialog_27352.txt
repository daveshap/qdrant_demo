DAMON: Look here, I don't like you getting in my face and saying this bullshit to me...
STARKS: That's too bad.
DAMON: I thought you said you never knew your father.
STARKS: I didn't. [Beat] Did you have anything to do with his death?
DAMON: I don't know what you're talking about, man. I swear. This is some weird shit you're telling me... and I don't know how come you're doing it.
STARKS: He died because he bled to death from a blow to his head. Someone had to have given him it.
DAMON: I never touched your father! I swear!
