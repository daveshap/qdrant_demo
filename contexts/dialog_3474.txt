JOSEPHINE: I talked with your father last night.
WILL: Did you?
JOSEPHINE: You never told me how your parents met.
WILL: They met at Auburn.
JOSEPHINE: What about the details? How they fell in love. The Circus. The War. You never told me any of that.
WILL: That's because most of it never happened.
JOSEPHINE: But it's romantic.
WILL: Mmm.
JOSEPHINE: Mmm, what?
WILL: Mmm, what. I know better than to argue romance with a French woman.
JOSEPHINE: Do you love your father?
WILL: Everyone loves my father. He's a very likeable guy.
JOSEPHINE: Do you love him?
WILL: You have to understand. When I was growing up, he was gone more than he was here. And I started thinking -- maybe he has a second life somewhere else. With another house, another family. He leaves us, he goes to them. Or maybe there is no family. Maybe he never wanted a family. But whatever it is, maybe he likes that second life better. And the reason he tells all those stories is because he can't stand this boring place.
JOSEPHINE: But it's not true.
WILL: What is true?" I've never heard my father say a single true thing."
WILL: Look, I know why you like him. I know why everyone likes him. But I need you to tell me I'm not crazy.
JOSEPHINE: You're not.
WILL: I need you on my side.
JOSEPHINE: I am always on your side. And I think you should talk to him.
EDWARD: Did I ever tell you about how...
WILL: Yes.
WILL: The maple tree and the Buick. We heard it.
EDWARD: I think someone hasn't.
