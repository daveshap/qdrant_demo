THE MAN: Fact of the matter, Muley, after what them dusters done to the land, the tenant system don't work no more. It don't even break even, much less show a profit. One man on a tractor can handle twelve or fourteen of these places. You just pay him a wage and take *all* the crop.
MULEY: But we couldn't *do* on any less'n what our share is now. The chillun ain't gettin' enough to eat as it is, and they're so ragged we'd be shamed if ever'body else's chillun wasn't the same way.
THE MAN: I can't help that. All I know is I got my orders. They told me to tell you you got to get off, and that's what I'm telling you.
MULEY: You mean get off my own land?
THE MAN: Now don't go blaming me. It ain't *my* fault.
