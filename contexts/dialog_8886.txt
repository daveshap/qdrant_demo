MONICA: Actually, that's my stage name.
FRANK: I'm sorry?
MONICA: Moran. Monica. The whole thing. It's my stage name. My real name's Blanche.
FRANK: Blanche.
MONICA: No romance, right? That's why I came up with Monica. It's what I prefer.
FRANK: Well, that's fine --
MONICA: But if you call my house and my mother answers, ask for Blanche. If you ask for Monica, she'll think you have the wrong number and hang up.
FRANK: Right.
MONICA: And if she asks what it's about, don't tell her. She's opposed to my career.
FRANK: Uh-huh. Well, Miss Moran, what is it you'd like to do for us?
MONICA: Candy Man.' Is that all right?
FRANK: It's one of Jack's favorites.
