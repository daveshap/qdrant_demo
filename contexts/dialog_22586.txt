LEE: I worked with Ambassador Han and his family for ten years. He wanted me to come with them to America. If I had, this might not have happened.
CARTER: Don't go there...
LEE: I could not come. I had other responsibilities.
CARTER: Hey, stop. We're just gonna wind up in some bar, drinking' to forget all the things we shoulda done and then you'll start singin' Beach Boy songs again. Then I'll really get depressed.
LEE: I also did not come because I think I would not fit in America.
CARTER: Hey, everybody fits in here. Look at L.A., man. Nobody's from here. My momma's from Detroit, my dad's from Atlanta, they met in Texas, got married in Vegas and I was born in Alabama. So where the hell am I from? Kenya?
CARTER: Alright, listen, no bullshit just tell me straight: did you really know the guy you were chasin'?
LEE: Yes. He was part of the Juntao crime family. He may be Juntao himself. And he dropped this.
