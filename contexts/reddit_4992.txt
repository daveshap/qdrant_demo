During your leave,what helped you guys from depression?
After 7 years long battle of letting depression take over my life, something has finally snapped and now I'm taking over my life. I'm dropping the year off. Yay!! My friends told me to think about it again but I know that this is the only thing that will help me out. 

So what helped you guys during your leave days?
