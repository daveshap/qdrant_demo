CATHY: Miss Daniels?
MELANIE: Yes?
CATHY: They're beautiful! They're just what I wanted! Is there a man and a woman? I can't tell which is which.
MELANIE: Well, I suppose...
MITCH: Hi. Annie had no plans, huh? I'm glad you came. Are you hungry?
MELANIE: Famished.
MITCH: Dinner's just about ready. We were out back looking at the chickens. Something seems to be wrong with them.
LYDIA: There's nothing wrong with those chickens, Mitch. I'm going to call Fred Brinkmeyer right now.
MITCH: I don't know what good that'll do. Chickens won't eat.
LYDIA: He sold the feed to me, didn't he?
MITCH: Caviat emptor, Mother. Let the buyer beware.
LYDIA: Whose side are you on?
MITCH: I'm simply quoting the law.
LYDIA: Never mind the law. Cathy, you can start serving the soup.
