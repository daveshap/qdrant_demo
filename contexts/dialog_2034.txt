CAROL: Hello?
MELVIN: Are you still coming?
CAROL: Yes.
CAROL: Melvin... I'd like to know exactly where we are going.
MELVIN: Just south to Baltimore, Maryland. So I know what you're going to ask next. That you might ask -- I'm not certain.
CAROL: There's... there's no need to bring anything dressy... or... I mean -- I didn't know if we'd be eating at any restaurant that have dress codes.
MELVIN: Oh. We might. Yes. We can. Let's.
CAROL: Okay, gotcha. What did you think I was going to ask?
MELVIN: Whether crabs are in season there now...
CAROL: Oh. Okay, then -- Melvin. Good night.
BEVERLY: How was it talking to him?
CAROL: Stop treating this like I'm going away with a man. He's just going to say those crappy, sick, complaining, angry things to me. I hate this, Mom -- I hate this. He's a freak show -- the worst person I ever met.
BEVERLY: Well, maybe he has nice friends.
