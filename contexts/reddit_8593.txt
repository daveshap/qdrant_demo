In what ways, if any, has the US contributed to the Venezuelan Humanitarian Crisis?
Venezuela is in the midst of a political, economic and most importantly humanitarian crisis. Huge emigration, the return of malaria and rampant hyper-inflation are among the issues.

Here is some history to ground the discussion:

Chavez' reign from 98-2007 was largely marked by increased political participation (in particular by marginilised groups)

and ambitious social programmes  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolivarian\_missions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolivarian_missions) .

&#x200B;

However after 07 a string of nationalisations took place:  [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-election-nationalizations/factbox-venezuelas-nationalizations-under-chavez-idUSBRE89701X20121008](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-election-nationalizations/factbox-venezuelas-nationalizations-under-chavez-idUSBRE89701X20121008).

&#x200B;

The economy became even more dependent on oil, which now makes up 98% of the value of their exports: [https://www.opec.org/opec\_web/en/about\_us/171.htm](https://www.opec.org/opec_web/en/about_us/171.htm).

Maduro was elected after Chavez' death and just as Oil prices were crashing. This put the economy into turmoil and Maduro has become increasingly authoritarian winning his second term in a highly questionable election   [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-politics-factbox/factbox-venezuelas-jailed-exiled-or-barred-opposition-politicians-idUSKBN1FC2OG](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-politics-factbox/factbox-venezuelas-jailed-exiled-or-barred-opposition-politicians-idUSKBN1FC2OG)

which was declared illegitimate by the national congress

The US has levied sanctions against Venezuelans from 2013-2017 followed by sanctions against the country beginning in Aug. 2017

[https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/IF10715.pdf](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/IF10715.pdf)

and has backed a leadership challenge from Guaido

&#x200B;

Mark Weisbrot and Jeffrey Sachs have stated that US sanctions are responsible for 40000 deaths along with other damage:  [http://cepr.net/images/stories/reports/venezuela-sanctions-2019-04.pdf](http://cepr.net/images/stories/reports/venezuela-sanctions-2019-04.pdf) .

&#x200B;

So my question is whether foreign (US, non-Venezuelan) actions were significant contributors to the crisis or if the majority of the blame falls on the Venezuelan government itself?
