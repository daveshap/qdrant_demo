Job offer on table, radio silence from company
So about 3 weeks ago I had a very successful interview. A few days later, I received an email from the hiring manager that said she was excited to offer me the job, pending background check. 

I sent back the forms right away, and was informed that the process usually takes around two weeks. A couple days later, hiring manager sends me another email saying she forgot to request my references (I had offered to provide them at several points during the interview process/in my thank you email following the interview) so I sent them along and asked her to keep me updated. 

It turns out there was a typo in the email address of one of my references (so embarrassing, I know, I had sent this same document to several other places too ugh), so we had another back and forth for me to provide the correct information and she says the HR team is finishing up the reference checks and she will keep me posted. 

This past Thursday marked the two week point since submitting my background check, and I haven't heard anything from them. I sent an email on Friday to check in and see how things are going, and have not received a response. 

This is weird because prior to this point, the hiring manager has been incredibly responsive, always getting back to me on the same day or early the next. It's also a 24/7 facility and I know the manager's work week is Tues-Sat, so it's not like the weekend would have an impact on her ability to communicate with me. She also emphasized to me a lot during the interview process that even when she is not at work, she is ALWAYS reachable by email. 

Should I be worried? Is HR just taking their sweet time? This is a dream job for me so the sudden lack of communication has me extremely worried and anxious. Just hoping someone in this subreddit has experience or words of wisdom for such a situation.
