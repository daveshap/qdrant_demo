Is my boss trying to get me fired?
I had sex with her 5 uears ago at univrsity. She have me an std and just kinda fizzled out. 

Now I took a job unaware she would be my supervisor.   I have no issue with her bit i get a gut feeling she is purpisefully scrutinizing me abd excluding important information from me. 

For example today she made me unsubmit a project so she could amend something she thought was better.  when she came to me originally she said"so why did you do that not this" she had a gloaty tone about her that screamed she finally got me.  Long story short she did not do her homework and had to go with what i had originally proposed.  She left work at quitting time right on the button and was obviously annoyed.  just before she found out i emailed her a rationale of why i did what I did and she disagreed with me in the email when i was just providing a rationale not attacking her decision. 

When she reviews my proects she latches onto anything she can find to record an error. 

many times she tells me things that are wrongvthat could unhinge my projects. 

However, her own work is riddled with errors so i really cant tell if she is just dumb or harassing me? Other people at work think she is dumb
