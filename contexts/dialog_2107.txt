ELECTRA: Did you think they were newlyweds?
RATH: I didn't notice them.
ELECTRA: When I first saw them I thought they were married.
RATH: How do you know they're not?
ELECTRA: I went into their room this afternoon.
RATH: What?
ELECTRA: It was no big deal. I saw them leave, I went in.
RATH: Jesus, if someone had --
ELECTRA: Nobody ever sees me.
RATH: Why in the hell would you take that chance?
ELECTRA: I heard them last night and it made me want to know something about them. I wanted to, so I did.
ELECTRA: She is married, but not to him. Another man, much older. She has four kids. The young guy works for her. And I think she likes kinky sex.
RATH: Thank you.
ELECTRA: Isn't it interesting though? I mean, look at us, in this room. Or yesterday, when we were walking in the plaza market. I mean, we look like just another couple. But what are we? Doesn't it seem so crazy?
RATH: No.
ELECTRA: No?
RATH: It's always been that way. The world has always functioned on two levels.
ELECTRA: I know. It makes me crazy.
RATH: Why?
ELECTRA: I don't know. When I was in college, I was forced to go to a psychiatrist because I was caught drilling holes in my dorm room floor.
RATH: And you were drilling these holes...?
ELECTRA: So I could watch the girl that lived under me.
RATH: Apparently this doctor was unable to cure you.
ELECTRA: He told me that my curiosity became unnaturally entangled with my sense of self-preservation.
RATH: Did he explain how this happened?
ELECTRA: He believed it all went back to one night, when as a little girl. I watched my parents have this big fight, really big. I thought my mother was going to kill my father. Then they went into their room and made up. And I watched them make love through the keyhole.
RATH: What are you doing?
ELECTRA: What?
RATH: That's a ridiculous move.
ELECTRA: Why?
RATH: Because, I'll take it.
ELECTRA: I'm playing white, remember. You can't tell me which pieces to move. It doesn't work that way.
ELECTRA: Can I ask you something?
RATH: I'm sure you will.
ELECTRA: Am I attractive?
RATH: Yes.
ELECTRA: Are you attracted to me?
RATH: Yes.
ELECTRA: Why?
RATH: Why? I don't know.
ELECTRA: Is it a physical thing, or a mental thing?
RATH: Both.
ELECTRA: Is that why you didn't want to talk about women before?
RATH: I didn't want to complicate the situation.
ELECTRA: Attraction is a complication?
RATH: It can be.
ELECTRA: It happened to you before?
RATH: Yes.
ELECTRA: Who was she?
RATH: Someone like me, like you. A pro.
ELECTRA: What happened to her?
RATH: She was taken.
ELECTRA: Did you --
RATH: No. I tried to stop it. I couldn't.
ELECTRA: Was she the only one?
RATH: After her, I realized that to survive I had to live without... It's dangerous to let things become complicated.
ELECTRA: Is this becoming complicated?
RATH: I'm not sure that I care anymore.
ELECTRA: Were you attracted to me right away?
RATH: No.
ELECTRA: When did it start?
RATH: Honestly?
ELECTRA: Uh-huh.
RATH: When I gave you my gun and you almost shot me.
ELECTRA: Maybe you should see a psychiatrist.
RATH: Why?
ELECTRA: That doesn't sound normal.
RATH: I'm not normal.
ELECTRA: I know. That's why I'm attracted to you. I mean, you make me nervous. You're intimidating. Maybe it's my curiosity/self-preservation thing, but all I can really think about right now is kissing you.
