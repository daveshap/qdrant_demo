Signed a contract for a new teaching job. Went into the contract signing with my previous contracts in hand and you should too.
This is going to be something that will directly apply to teachers, but could also apply to anyone else. I was recently offered a job in a public school district; and as a teacher who was hired into a public district, your salary is based on your experience. In my situation, it's specifically based on the number of "contracted years of service" you have.   


I went in today to sign my contract and on the contract it had my salary, as well as my specific "step" on the salary schedule that matched my experience. Only, it didn't actually match my experience. It was 2 years short. For some that may not be a big deal, but in this case it was a $4000+ difference in salary. The district I was being hired into did not count my previous time as a "student support specialist" at a private school as actual "teaching experience." Luckily, I had been through this once before and was wise enough to have my contract from that job on hand.   


I said to the HR person that my experience on the contract didn't match my actual experience. They said, "Yeah, when you were a 'student support specialist,' we weren't sure if that was a contracted teaching position or not." I replied with, "It actually was a contracted teaching position and luckily, I have my contract from that position with me today." I handed it to the HR director, and within 5 minutes she had my new contract updated to the correct experience and the salary to match it. It was very easy for me to print it out, but printing it out earned me $4000+ all because I was prepared.   


So if you're going for a teaching position (or any position that bases your salary off of your years of service), bring your previous contracts. It may cost you 5-cents per page to print, but can secure you thousands and set you up to be at a higher "step" in the salary schedule.
