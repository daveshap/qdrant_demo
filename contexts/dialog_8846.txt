KARL: Excuse me Miss?
CHRIS: What!
KARL: A man to see you.
CHRIS: What man?
KINDERMAN: Does your daughter remember if perhaps Mr. Dennings was in her room in her room that night?
CHRIS: No, she was heavily sedated.
KINDERMAN: It's serious?
CHRIS: Yes, I'm affraid it is.
KINDERMAN: May I ask...?
CHRIS: We still don't know.
KINDERMAN: Watch out for drafts. A draft in the fall when the house is hot is a magic carpet for bacteria.
KARL: Excuse me Madame? Will there be anything else?
CHRIS: No thanks Karl.
