ALEX: Now what else? DAVID I don't know.
ALEX: A spade, we need a spade -- I wish you would concentrate -- we need a spade if we're going to dig a pit.
DAVID: So who's going to do it?
ALEX: Dig the pit, I don't know.
DAVID: No, not that.
ALEX: Then what? Who's going to do what?
DAVID: You know what I'm talking about.
ALEX: Do I? What? What? What are you talking about?
DAVID: You know what. Who's going to do it.
ALEX: We all are, David, we're all going to do it. Each of us, you, me and Juliet, will do his or her bit. Is that fair enough?
DAVID: I can't do it.
ALEX: I don't hear this.
DAVID: I won't be able to.
ALEX: You're telling me you want out? Already? You're telling me you don't want the money? Hugo is going off. He smells. The flat smells. We can't wait any longer.
DAVID: I'm just telling you I can't cut him up.
JULIET: Who's going to do it?
ALEX: I thought we all were.
JULIET: I don't thinkI can.
ALEX: But you're a doctor. You kill people every day.
JULIET: I don't want to. It's different.
ALEX: And now you tell me.
