Is there any evidence, in practice, which suggests that a tax on carbon will have wide-spread economic benefits?
This morning, CNN put out [an article](http://money.cnn.com/2016/08/30/investing/hillary-clinton-climate-change-joseph-stiglitz-advice/) quoting Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz, who has previously worked as the Senior Vice President of the World Bank, [has spoken against the TPP](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/10/in-2016-better-trade-agreements-trans-pacific-partnership), and who wrote in 2007 an article for The Guardian entitled, ["Carbon-Taxing the Rich"](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/dec/07/carbontaxingtherich), in which he laments the shortcomings of the Kyoto Protocol -- affirming his belief that a cap-and-trade system is too soft on companies who pollute, and doesn't provide enough deterrent: 

>"...polluting industries like the cap-and-trade system. While it provides them an incentive not to pollute, emission allowances offset much of what they would have to pay under a tax system. Some firms can even make money off the deal. Moreover, Europe has grown used to the concept of cap-and-trade, and many are loathe to try an alternative. Yet, no one has proposed an acceptable set of principles for assigning emission rights."

What both this article and the CNN article seem to miss is the specific economic analysis of such a system. Europe, as Stiglitz mentioned, has become used to a Cap-and-Trade system, although some countries in Northern Europe had already begun to tax carbon at the time of the article, and some (such as [Ireland](http://www.nesc.ie/assets/files/downloads/project_climate%20change/ucd_workshop/ericgargan.pdf)) have since implemented a system which places a price on emissions. So while there has been hesitation in [many countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_tax#Implementation) to introduce such a tax, there ought to be enough of a sample that economic benefits can be seen and analyzed. David Suzuki, [on his website](http://www.davidsuzuki.org/issues/climate-change/science/climate-solutions/carbon-tax-or-cap-and-trade/), mentions that Sweden's economy has more than doubled since they brought in a carbon tax -- though this was in 1991, and the growth might be due to other factors. 

Stiglitz, however, believes the evidence is clear: "I think a carbon tax would stimulate the economy."

Is there any evidence to suggest this is true?
