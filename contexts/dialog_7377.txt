MRS. BRUCE: Jeremiah, what are you doing?
JAM: Uhh... nothing.
JAM: Ahh, sunshine.
MRS. BRUCE: You're going to be late if you don't hurry up and change soon.
JAM: Change? What's wrong with what I got on?
MRS. BRUCE: It's dirty laundry for one thing and for another, you still haven't worn the clothes I bought you. You're skating on thin ice already, young man, so I wouldn't push my luck. Now get out of those rags.
JAM: But, mom!
MRS. BRUCE: Besides, those jeans are so tight I can see your penis.
