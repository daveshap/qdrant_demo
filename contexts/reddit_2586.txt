What are hiring managers and hr really looking for on a LinkedIn profile that the can't find on a resume?
Watched a video where the guy was saying it's used for discrimination and doesn't have any verification of employment. It's becoming required by more jobs in order to get more information on an candidate than they normally don't need so they can use it to discriminate (age, sexual orientation, race, job gaps etc.)

Is this what it's actually used for? I'd prefer from actual hiring managers and hr but i'm open to all opinions. I have never thought about it that way, I just have it to connect with people and keep a network open.
