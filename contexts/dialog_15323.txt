KLUTE: You asked if there was anything more you could help me with.
BREE: When?
KLUTE: I've checked the records of Jane McKenna's death -- I can't get anything special. But Frank Ligourin had another girl you said, besides McKenna and you.
BREE: Arlyn Page.
KLUTE: Did she and Jane McKenna know each other?
BREE: Frankie kept them in the same apartment: it cut his travel-time.
KLUTE: Then maybe Arlyn Page knew the Dumper too.
BREE: Arlyn had a very big habit - heroin - she's the one who started Frank. She's strung out now; you won't find her.
KLUTE: You could help me find her. You know the people. I'll pay you a hundred dollars.
BREE: I can make that in a lunch break! Look, Hiram, you're sure it isn't just me? -- you decided you liked it, after all, the other night; you'll hang around for seconds?
KLUTE: Don't worry.
