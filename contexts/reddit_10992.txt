I think about dying whenever I’m stressed
I haven’t been actively suicidal for a little over a year. Yet, whenever things get difficult, my mind always turns to suicide. Every time. I feel pathetic and really weak for feeling suicidal from normal life stresses...sometimes it makes me feel like I’m not cut out for life...

I don’t necessarily want to die, because I want to fulfill my dreams (which are really basic...traveling more, making a lifelong friend group, finding love, etc etc) but things just get so difficult and I wonder if my dreams are worth all this suffering.
