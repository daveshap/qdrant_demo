ASHLEY: I figured you walked outta there and saw me and walked right the other way --
RUDY: No, no --
ASHLEY: Saw my outfit or something, my coat --
RUDY: No, hey, I like your coat --
ASHLEY: Saw me --
RUDY: Ashley, no. That was me, that's what I was scared of. I mean, be serious... I ain't exactly looking like Mr. Universe here.
ASHLEY: You are to me.
ASHLEY: Thought you wrote you had a mustache.
RUDY: I can get another one going. Y'know, hey, whatever you want me to --
ASHLEY: No, no, no. Be like you want to be.
RUDY: Do that again.
ASHLEY: What.
RUDY: Smile.
ASHLEY: No --
RUDY: One more. Smile. One more.
ASHLEY: No, c'mon --
RUDY: I've been dreaming about that smile, Ashley Mercer. For a long time.
