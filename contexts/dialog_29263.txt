BABE BROTHER: I need to get my suitcase out of the garage.
SUZIE: What for?
BABE BROTHER: I'm going back home with Harry.
SUZIE: I've heard some foolish things in my life.
BABE BROTHER: Harry is coming to pick me up.
SUZIE: Have you lost your mind? Have you thought about your wife and child, not to mention your sick father? And I need your help to move his bed from under the leak in the ceiling.
BABE BROTHER: I'm busy.
SUZIE: Don't make me raise my hand to you. You have to see for yourself that you are going in the wrong direction.
BABE BROTHER: Can't I be myself without you jumping in with your right and wrong? The world is not black and white. Show me one perfect person. If you can't, don't ask me to be.
SUZIE: I do have a right to ask you to be a little bit better than me and your father because we gave you a better head start. You have no right to complain to us about your not having enough. You sit right there with your no manners self.
