\"Roger was asking for help to heavens\" is wrong sentence? I'm not a native but I'm working as a writer, writing American gossip news. My boss told me that \"Roger was asking for help to heavens.\" is a wrong sentence. What is wrong with it and what's the correct phrase? Because I've subscribed to grammarly and it didn't find any mistake on the grammar. Thanks before.
