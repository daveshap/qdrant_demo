Displaying labels from a lower zoom level? In QGIS, is there a way to \"pin\" labels and features from a lower zoom level so that they appear higher up?For instance, considering a map of the US, it would be impossibly cluttered to show every local road and town on a national scale. What if for instance, I wanted to take a specific road and the cities along it, and pin their labels such that these few features appeared even on a national scale? For example, could I take the section of I90 that runs through South Dakota and ensure that it and each town along the road appeared at all zoom levels?I'm using QuickMapServices for base maps, but suspect this is something that can be done more generally if at all.
