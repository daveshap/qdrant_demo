WALLACE: War finds me willing. I know it won't bring back all I have lost. But it can bring what none of us have ever had -- a country of our own. For that we need a king. We need you.
ROBERT: I am trying.
WALLACE: Then tell me what a king is! Is he a man who believes only what others believe? Is he one who calculates the numbers for and against him but never weighs the strength in your own heart? There is strength in you. I see it. I know it.
ROBERT: I must... consult with my father.
WALLACE: And I will consult with mine.
