Stop👏joining👏dating👏sites👏if👏you👏don't👏intend👏to👏date!
The last 3 people I've talked to all intended to meet up for a date. We would talk for about a month or so to get to know each other and then plan a day to meet up. A couple days before or the day of they decide to change plans or leave me by myself and give me some BS excuse or ghost on me all together.

This one person I've been talking to for almost 3 months keeps coming up with excuses and now out of nowhere she just ghosted me for about a week and apologized to me saying she didn't mean to ghost if that's how I felt and now she's doing it again. 

If you don't like someone, just tell them and don't leave them wondering what the hell happened
