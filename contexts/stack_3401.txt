Short story about an assassin and and his alien ambassador target This has bugged me for some time re an anthology of Dark Fantasy stories I read in the 1980's.  The basic synopsis of the short story I remember best is that an assassin is contracted to kill a politician, little knowing he is an alien and is expecting him.  I was sure the story went by the title 'a small kindness' which relates to how at its end when the assassin thinks better of what he is contracted to do his 'target' shields him from getting wet.  Nevertheless I cannot track it down.  I remember it having a number of good stories which I'd love to re-visit if some helpful soul could just point me in the right direction!
