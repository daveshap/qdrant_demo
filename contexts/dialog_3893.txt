NICK: Finally got her back to sleep.
HEATHER: Nick, what you should do is get her back up and get her to a goddamn <u>doctor</u>.
NICK: Jesus, you don't think I know that? You don't think I've tried? She won't fucking <u>go</u>-- she won't leave this place.
HEATHER: She's off her fucking rocker--
NICK: --I know!
HEATHER: I'm sorry.
NICK: Yeah, I know. It's...alright. We're all a little--
HEATHER: --a <u>lot</u>.
NICK: Heather.
HEATHER: Yeah.
NICK: Okay. Hypothetically.
HEATHER: Shoot.
NICK: You think....there could've been something up in those woods that Anna--
HEATHER: --it's not a could've--there <u>was</u>, Nick. And it fucked up Anna, and did something to Domini, and it caused my father to die, and it's here <u>with</u> us in this place <u>now</u>. And I don't have one single idea in hell what's going to happen next, just that it's going to happen to one of us. And then the other. And then the other. It's going to get into our <u>brains</u>.
NICK: There's explanations. Rational explanations for everything that's happened. We'll drive ourselves crazy if we keep obsessing on supernatural what-ifs.
HEATHER: That feels good. Lower--down into my neck.
NICK: I don't know what it is, but there is something <u>happening</u> here, and it's starting to scare the living shit out me, and look, I'm just <u>not</u> going to argue the point anymore--you want to stay here, stay, but I've got to get the fuck out of here, and I'm begging you to come <u>with</u> me.
ANNA: I can't.
NICK: Then I'm going--
ANNA: --no, you're not. You love me too much. You don't want to see them kill me.
