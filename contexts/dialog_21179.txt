DRISCOLL: The Harbor police have just picked up a dead man out of the water.
KILLAINE: Floater?
DRISCOLL: Not a floater. Only just dead.
KILLAINE: You're the waterfront specialist. Find out about it. I've got a murder to investigate.
DRISCOLL: You have two murders to investigate. This man's head was beaten in. And there's nothing in his pockets.
KILLAINE: Drunk-rolling job. They hit him too hard.
DRISCOLL: I've been on the waterfront detail for twelve years. This man hadn't been dead an hour. He wasn't killed last night. He was killed today. In broad daylight. That's no drunk- rolling job.
KILLAINE: Let me know when you've identified him
KILLAINE: And don't get too logical, Driscoll. In police business it doesn't work. I wish it did. But it doesn't
DRISCOLL: I'm an Irishman, sir. An Irishman is always logical.
