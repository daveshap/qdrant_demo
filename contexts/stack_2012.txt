Is there a term for using \"or\" to introduce something like an appositive? Recently someone was trying to explain to me that \"or\" can have a non-disjunctive function, and this came to mind as a possible example but I can't figure out the terminology to describe it. I know that I've seen \"or\" used to introduce something like an appositive in a sentence, thusly:\"In her 'vlog,' or video log, she asserted that...\"Actually, now I'm not totally sure that's really an appositive. Anyway, I'm not finding this under anything I have on \"or\" or appositives, so I'm wondering if it's a legitimate usage with a name, a weird colloquialism, or what. Also, potentially, from \"Sixteen Going on Seventeen\" from The Sound of Music: \"...sometime in my youth, or childhood/I must have done something good\" (depending upon whether \"youth\" and \"childhood\" are the same thing in this song).
