IKE: Livid is good. So what is it, Maggie? You here on business? I saw your lamps. They're terrific.
MAGGIE: It's something I've always wanted to do.
IKE: You actually could make breaking and entering into a new career. So, what are you doing here?
MAGGIE: I wanted to talk to you about why I run or ride away from things.
IKE: Does it matter?
MAGGIE: I think so... When I was walking down the aisle? I was walking toward somebody who didn't have any idea who I really was. And it was only half the other person's fault, because I had done everything to convince him that I was exactly what he wanted. So it was good that I didn't go through with it because it would have been a lie, but you -- you knew the real me.
IKE: Yes, I did.
MAGGIE: I didn't. And you being the one at the end of the aisle didn't just fix that.
