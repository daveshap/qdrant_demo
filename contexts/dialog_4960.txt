CARLA: Are you trying to be funny?
LEONARD: I'm totally serious!
LEONARD: The question is what are you going to make next, Walter? Did you make that dog yet, or that parakeet? How about making something out of the cockroaches in your room?
WALTER: I-I already got a new one!
CARLA: Great! What is it?
WALTER: It's a...full length life-size figure!
CARLA: What's it called?
WALTER: Murdered man.
LEONARD: Murdered...man?...
CARLA: When do we get to see it? WALTER Well...any time, I guess.
LINK: Man that's a trippy name, kinda like the Warhol mayhem series...
CUFF: I saw a statue once called The Third Time Phyllis Saw Me She Exploded.
LINK: Now what kind of statue was that?
CUFF: I don't know it was made out of driftwood and dipped in sulfuric acid. It was out there...
LEONARD: Well...why murdered man?
WALTER: I don't know, it just happened, I guess. I didn't mean to.
LEONARD: You didn't mean to what?
WALTER: Well, I mean it could have been something else, but it just worked out that way.
CARLA: It's called spontaneity, Leonard. Get with the program.
WALTER: Yeah it was all just an accident.
CARLA: Are you alright?
LEONARD: Yes...I'm uh...I'm fine.
