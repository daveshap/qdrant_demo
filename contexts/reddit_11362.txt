A video of my close friend went viral and she's getting so much hate.
A good friend of mine recently got drunk and made a mistake, she is an awesome person when she's sober but give her a few drinks and she gets out of control. A video of her recently went viral and reading the harsh comments and speculations about her mental health is driving me nuts. She does need help but on top of this extremely embarrassing video going viral in such a short time and losing her job because of it I cant help but feel bad. All parties involved got so much hate. You see videos on the internet and just automatically thing the bad guy depicted in the video is just the bad guy but I know this girl so personally that I can only imagine how horrible she feels after the incident.
