ERIN: What are you doing here?
ED: I got an interesting call this afternoon. It was from a Dr. Frankel.
ERIN: Oh, yeah?
ED: He wanted you to know the legal limit for hexavalent chromium, is .05 parts per million. And that at the rate you mentioned, .58, it could be responsible for the cancers in that family you asked about. The Irvings.
ERIN: Well, that was nice of him. Isn't it funny how some people go out of their way to help people and others just give 'em the ax?
ED: Look, I'm sorry. You were gone. I just assumed you were off having fun.
ERIN: Now, why in the hell would you assume that?
ED: I don't know. Maybe cause you look like someone who has a lot of fun.
ERIN: Boy, are you ever a shitty judge of people.
ED: So what's the story on this thing? This cancer stuff?
ERIN: You wanna know, you gotta hire me back. I got a lot of bills to pay.
