Please help
I can never accept compliments or validation, as a kid I was never enough for my parents. I was always compared to my older sister who was perfect in their eyes and was forced to be an example for my brother to follow putting me at the blame of he ever screwed around because I should be teaching him better. Once I got older I stopped caring about the executions of people who would never be satisfied like my parents but even then I kept the feelings of never being good enough. Now we there people compliments my art, looks, or personality I have to dryly say thank you but can never truly believe it because my brain makes an excuse that im not good enough. No matter how many times people or friends try the feelings are hurried that I am and will never be good enough.
