Incredibly lonely without a job
Edit 2: I just got called in for a job interview next week. Wish me luck!

Edit: Thank you to everyone for your kind words of advice. I really appreciate you all taking the time to help me.  I'm going to look into some volunteer work and keep trying to get a PT job while I look for the right career opportunity.  Thanks again. 

Not sure if this is the best place to post this so I'm sorry in advance if it's not.

I've been unemployed (and actively looking/interviewing) for about seven months now.  Over the last month or two the rejections and the massive amounts of time I've been spending alone have really started getting to me.  Does anyone have any ideas of things I can do to beat the loneliness of not having a job?

Before unemployment I was a full time student, held 3 part-time jobs at my university, and was really involved in different university organizations. I enjoyed the first few months after graduation a lot, but I'm really starting to miss being around people and having things to do.  All my friends have jobs and my boyfriend lives about 3 hours away so I'm basically home alone all day, watching Netflix, writing, and applying to jobs (and getting dozens of rejections emails, of course).  I just don't know what to do anymore.
