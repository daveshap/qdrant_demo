M 28 I've been coasting too long and need to find a career path, Should I go back to school? or look within my current industry?
I am currently working as a Bar Manager, I've been a cook/waiter/bartender/ for about 11 years and have been a Manager for the last 2 years of those 11. I'm very tired of it, for various reasons. 

I have a bachelors in Art and a Minor in Hospitality Management. My art degree was multi faceted and had some museum studies in it. If I wanted to work in a museum (which I do think I would enjoy) I'd need to go back for my masters, which is a bit of an uphill battle. 

I've also considered looking at other jobs within the hospitality industry, jobs that have a but more of a structured schedule and better long term prospects. Liquor or Beer Sales rep, higher level management. 

I'm also proficient enough with computers, I took a net+ class in high school and enjoyed it, I've thought about taking the tests for network security certifications and maybe looking at being a network admin or at the very least IT somewhere. 

Honestly, I'm just super lost and don't even know where to start, any advice?
