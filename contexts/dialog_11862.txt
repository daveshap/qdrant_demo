TOMMY: What about the Jack-O-Lantern?

TOMMY: What about the rest of my comic books?
LAURIE: After the Jack-O-Lantern.
TOMMY: What about the bogyman?
LAURIE: There is no such thing.
TOMMY: Richie said he was coming after me tonight.
LAURIE: Do you believe everything that Richie tells you?
TOMMY: No...
LAURIE: Tommy, Halloween night is when you play tricks on people and scare them. It's all make believe.
TOMMY: I saw the bogyman. I saw him outside.
LAURIE: There was no one outside.
TOMMY: There WAS.
LAURIE: What did he look like?
TOMMY: The bogyman!
LAURIE: We're no getting anywhere. All right, look, Tommy. The bogyman can only come out on Halloween night, right?
TOMMY: Right.
LAURIE: And I'm here tonight and I won't let him get to you.
TOMMY: Promise?
LAURIE: I promise.
TOMMY: Can we make the Jack-O-Lantern now?
