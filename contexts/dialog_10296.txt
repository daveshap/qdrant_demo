GWEN: What IS that thing? It serves no useful purpose to have a bunch of CHOPPY CRUSHY things in the middle of a CATWALK!?.'
JASON: Gwen...
GWEN: We shouldn't have to DO this! It makes NO LOGICAL SENSE! Why is it HERE?
JASON: Because it was on the show!
GWEN: Well forget it! I'm not going. This episode was badly written!
BRANDON: Commander, you and Lt. Madison will have to go through the crushers one at a time in three second intervals. Tell me when the first crusher hits the bottom...
JASON: Okay, now. But-
BRANDON: Wait two seconds then go.
JASON: No, wait, are you-
BRANDON: Lt. Madison, GO.
JASON: Shit! Go!
BRANDON: GO Commander.
