GRIFFIN: How've you been?
SPICOLI: Outrageous, Merv. Nice to be here. I feel great.
GRIFFIN: I was going to say... your eyes look a little red.
SPICOLI: I've been swimming, Merv.
SPICOLI: Seriously, Merv, everything is great. I was thinking about picking up some hash this weekend, maybe going up to the mountains.
GRIFFIN: I wanted to talk a little bit about school, if I could...
SPICOLI: School. School is no problem. All you have to do is go to get the grades. And if you know something, all you have to do is go about half the time.
GRIFFIN: How often do you go?
SPICOLI: I don't go at all.
GRIFFIN: I hear you brought a film clip with you. Do you want to set it up for us?
SPICOLI: Well, it pretty much speaks for itself. Peter, you want to run with it?
SPICOLI: Merv, this is the action down at Sunset Cliffs at about six in the morning.
GRIFFIN: Fascinating.
GRIFFIN: Who's that?
SPICOLI: That's me, Merv.
GRIFFIN: Are you going to ride that wave?
SPICOLI: Totally.
GRIFFIN: What's going through your mind right here, Jeff? The danger of it all?
SPICOLI: Merv, I'm thinking... I've only got about four good hours of surfing left before these little clowns from junior high start showing up with their boogie boards.
CURTIS: Dad says you have to get up!
SPICOLI: Ugh.
SPICOLI: Leave me alone!
CURTIS: Dad says you're late again, you butthole!
SPICOLI: Leave me alone.
CURTIS: Dad says!
