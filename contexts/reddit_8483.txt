We're four political betting experts. It's been a volatile couple of years in the world of politics, and we spend our time trying to predict what will happen next. Ask us anything!
We are four political betting experts working for well-known bookmakers (Ladbrokes & Star Sports) and prediction markets (Smarkets & Betfair). We are holding an AMA now talking all things betting and politics - from how the odds are decided, to how often we get it right, and fundamentally how good of an indicator the markets are for what will happen in the future.
