CABLE: I'm flying back out to Pennsylvania Friday; I'll fill them in on things.
KLUTE: How is it back there?
CABLE: I think you're homesick. I'll be out at my camp over the weekend. Nice right now, that touch of fall in the air, that skim of frost in the early mornings, very peaceful. John, I'll be back here again Thursday; I'll be in touch. Lieutenant, thank you.
