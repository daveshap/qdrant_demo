LETTY: What else would you do?
MICHAEL: I'd like to drink a bottle of red wine with you and then make love to you and spend the whole night together. And we'd get up in the morning and spend hours lounging around and reading the paper.
LETTY: And we'd eat Spaghetti-O's in bed from the can.
MICHAEL: How can you even mention Spaghetti- O's after eating Grandma Rosa's dinner tonight?
LETTY: I have a terrible confession.
MICHAEL: Tell the doctor.
LETTY: I don't like lamb.
MICHAEL: Then it's over.
LETTY: Lie down.
MICHAEL: It's a good thing my family loves you.
LETTY: Your family just met me.
MICHAEL: You're right. I guess I was projecting. What I should have said is, It's a good thing I love you.""
LETTY: Do you?
MICHAEL: I do.
LETTY: Michael, I...
MICHAEL: It's OK. You don't have to say anything.
LETTY: But I do. I love you, too.
