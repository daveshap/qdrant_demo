JACK: You too? This holiday's about giving, Adelle. And I'm giving everything I've got to this deal, so in a way, I'm more Christmassy than anyone... Lifesaver?
ADELLE: You're a ray of sunshine, Jack.
ADELLE: Oh, and Oxxford called...
JACK: Ooh, my suits are ready...
JACK: Kate Reynolds...
ADELLE: Her assistant said you could call her at home after eight.
JACK: Her assistant?
ADELLE: Yeah Jack, her assistant...
JACK: Kate Reynolds was my girlfriend in college. I almost married her...
ADELLE: You? Married?
JACK: Almost married. And almost a junior broker at E.F. Hutton...
ADELLE: Excuse me?
JACK: She didn't want me to go to London. We're standing at the airport saying goodbye and she asks me to stay.
ADELLE: So you left her? Just like that?
JACK: God, no. I thought about it for practically the entire flight...
ADELLE: Stop Jack, I'm getting all weepy.
JACK: I took the road less traveled, Adelle.
ADELLE: And look where it's led you... I'm gonna get her on the phone...
JACK: No...
ADELLE: No?! You almost married this woman. Aren't you even curious what she wants?
JACK: She's probably just having a fit of nostalgia. You know, lonely Christmas Eve, call the one that got away, that kind of thing.
