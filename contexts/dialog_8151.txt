EXLEY: What's that for?
JACK: Bud White. He sees us and we're dead.
JACK: Jesus... Maybe White's not so dumb after all.
EXLEY: Rita Hayworth at the morgue and now Veronica Lake with White. What the hell's going on?
JACK: Movie star hookers. Whatever you desire... It's Fleur-fr-Lis again.
EXLEY: What's Fleur-de-Lis?
JACK: High line whores. With plastic surgery to look like movie stars. And who knows what else? It's run by this guy Pierce Patchett. You want to talk to him?
EXLEY: Yeah. But first I want to brace Stompanato.
