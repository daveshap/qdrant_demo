AL: Some agent you are.
JOE: Why don't you get out of my face.
AL: Bingo.
JOE: You found her.
AL: Better. I found Ryuji.
JOE: That's good. It's not better. Where?
AL: Osaka.
JOE: Osaka?

JOE: Don't you think I stand out like this.
AL: We are trying to stand out. Right near his address. Easier to get them to come to us, than to try and find them. ..now keep your eyes open, something might present itself.
JOE: I'm running in circles in the middle of some foreign country. I don't speak their language, they don't speak mine. I don't even know where I am. What's going to present itse........
JOE: What do I do?
AL: Follow her.
JOE: On what?
AL: Run, stupid!
AL: Come on, she's getting away.
JOE: I can't keep up.
