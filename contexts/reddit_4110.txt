Accepting the inevitable
Hey guys im new here. Im currently 31 years old, male. I can't remember the last time ive been on a dating or held hands with a girl. It just seems to me that i guess there isn't a soulmate for me. Anger and depression overwelmed me at times, and i feel like im on my end link... I tried and almost killed myself by wrecking my car into a wall. But i guess something still wants me here. I dont feel like it..
