Guys need to stop filtering themselves for girls that won't like them anyways.
I'm  a 30 year old man, and I can't even find enough fingers to count how many times I've  bit my tounge to the point where it looks like a dogs chew  toy in my early 20s. 

And for what? To please a girl into believing she knows you when youre just filtering  yourself? It's  not worth it. The woman that likes you will get your humor. She'll  laugh the fuck out of your jokes and she'll  vibe with you when the others think you're  obnoxious.

We're  not put on this earth to be a people pleaser. If someone  doesn't  like you. Simply and kindly say" take a number". Be yourself and whoever will come your way will be there.
