How do I tell my parents I have depression
I’m so scared to tell them, they can be difficult most of the time and they don’t really understand a lot of English. For about the past 5 months I’ve been depressed and having anxiety, I no longer feel like this but I don’t feel the same I’m not the same person, I’m not funny or witty anymore, it’s hard for me to find words, I can barely socialize normally now, my speech is a little impaired, my head has this weird feeling and whenever I shake my head I feel some sort of pain, and the most obvious sign is that I can easily get a song stuck in my head. 

I’ve mostly been depressed over a girl, yeah I know, but I’ve been feeling lonely and distancing myself from my friends cause of anxiety and the constant thought of not being the funny witty guy anymore and not having anything to talk about. I couldn’t even do my school work, I haven’t been watching any shows or youtubers that I used to watch when I was still in school. and to be honest I’m not even sure why I’m depressed and had anxiety anymore.
