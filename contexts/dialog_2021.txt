DR. BETTES: How long has he been having problems?
CAROL: Since forever.
DR. BETTES: Have they done blood tests on him?
CAROL: Yes.
DR. BETTES: Only in the emergency room or when he was well.
CAROL: Emergency room only.
DR. BETTES: Have they done skin testing for allergies?
CAROL: No.
DR. BETTES: They haven't done the standard scratch test. Where they make small injections into the skin?
CAROL: No. I asked. They said it's not covered under my plan. And it's not necessary anyway.
DR. BETTES: It's amazing these things weren't done.
CAROL: Fucking H.M.O. bastard piece of shit... I'm sorry... forgive me.
DR. BETTES: No. Actually, I think that's their technical name.
CAROL: Once the tests come back, is there someone I can reach in your office for the results?
DR. BETTES: Me. My home number is on this card.
CAROL: His home number.
CAROL: Do you want some juice or coffee or two female slaves?
DR. BETTES: Water... Nobody told you it might be a good idea to remove the carpeting and drapes in Spencer's room?
CAROL: No.
