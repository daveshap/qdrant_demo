MBA vs. MHA: Not sure what to do.
I am 26y/o, graduated with a BBA majoring in Management Information Systems and have been working as in the benefits administration field as an analyst for 3.5 years. Recently I moved from working as a third party administrator (Aon Hewitt & Willis Towers Watson) to a new job with a carrier (BCBS) in which I am doing Government Programs Strategy  analyst work (working with Medicare/Medicaid populations). 

My company is offering a special partnership program with a nearby university that would allow employees of my company to basically do a Masters of Health Administration (assuming we get accepted) through the university for at very little expense to the employee (16k for full program 15,75k in reimbursement ...plus fees/books for courses), which got me really excited because I’ve always wanted to get a Masters degree/MBA. 

Or 

I could start working on applying for an MBA program at another nearby university (mainly just prep and takef GRE/GMAT). The cost would be more (not sure the specific amount), but a good portion of the program would be covered by the company’s reimbursement policy. 

I’m conflicted in whether or not to go with the MHA or the MBA, as I am not as familiar with where my business background would be of an advantage if I tried to go down the path of a career in Healthcare Administration going forward OR going to get an MBA where I have a background in business and could go down a variety of paths if I decide to go elsewhere in the future. 

Any thoughts or ideas on what I could do with a business background and an MHA  or if it’s even worth considering would be super helpful! Thanks in advance. 

TL;DR - have a BBA in Management Information Systems. Have been working in benefits admin as analyst since college. New job offers **almost** free MHA but can also get MBA with reimbursement. Not sure what to do.
