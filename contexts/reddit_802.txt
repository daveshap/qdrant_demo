Does my tutor like me?
This guy (my age) has been tutoring me in math for a couple days. He’s really nice and he always helps me to understand the material, no matter how long it takes. Sometimes it feels like he’s flirting with me, but it could just be him trying to help me. What could be some signs that he’s interested?
