EMMA: You're late.
ALEXANDER: Got here as soon as I could.
EMMA: Dance with me...
ALEXANDER: You know I can't.
EMMA: Trust me...
EMMA: Alex, what is it?
ALEXANDER: Holding you... again.
EMMA: Darling.
ALEXANDER: I need... to talk to you.
EMMA: All right...
ALEXANDER: Not here... alone. Please.
EMMA: Let's walk through the park...
ALEXANDER: No... let's walk through the city.
EMMA: All right...
EMMA: Alex, what is it?
ALEXANDER: Nothing -- let's just get out of the park.
EMMA: Alex...?!
ALEXANDER: Shhh. Let's just hurry on here. We don't have to talk, all right?
EMMA: Why do we have to race for heaven's sake?!
ALEXANDER: I want to get into the light, that's all. Please...
