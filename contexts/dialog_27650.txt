PETE: I see you got the telegram.
ADELE: Pete, I'm so sorry about what they did to you. I didn't think you'd come back, I thought you'd want to write again...
PETE: Dell, I can't write unless I'm happy, and I can't be happy unless I'm here -- and with you. This is me, Delly. Pete Appleton. And I love you!
ADELE: And I love you, Pete!
