How much evidence is there linking Saudi funding for conservative Muslim schools and terrorist attacks against western countries?
Saudi Arabia may have spent more than [$100 billion](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-yousaf-butt-/saudi-wahhabism-islam-terrorism_b_6501916.html) promoting Wahabism throughout the Islamic world. Saudi textbooks promoting an Wahabist worldview were even [used in the Islamic state](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/26/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-islam.html) before they could write their own (though of course Saudi Arabia explicitly condemns the Islamic State). And of course Osama bin Laden was from a wealthy Saudi family.

So at least on a superficial level it seems like Saudi Arabia has strong connections to modern Islamic extremism, but I don't know if that is the whole story. How exactly is Saudi money spent internationally used? Are there consistent, provable ties to Saudi-funded mosques and terrorists? What is there online presence like--with so many terrorist attacks coming from homegrown "self-radicalized" Muslims living or born in the west, are they connecting somehow to Wahabist religious teachings online, or are online radical communities completely unrelated to the Saudis?
