yale released a podcast detailing their admissions process- "inside the yale admissions office"!
if anyone else is bored in quarantine and summer or yale is their dream school or want more transparency in the admissions process, they have a podcast! i've been listening and it seems fairly helpful to take a closer look at the admissions process during the upcoming admissions cycle
