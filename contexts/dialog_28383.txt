BOUDREAU: Twist! When did you get back in town?
TWIST: Coupla days ago. I'm workin' a big one with Gondorff on the North Side.
TWIST: Listen Duke, we're setting up a wire store. I need a twenty man boost right away.
BOUDREAU: I got twenty or so in here tonight. Take your pick.
TWIST: These guys have gotta be the quill, Duky. We can't afford to rank the joint.
BOUDREAU: Get me the sheet, Jake. Let's see who's in town.
BOUDREAU: Twist, you know this guy?
TWIST: No. Never saw him before. He's a dick, though.
