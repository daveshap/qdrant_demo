MELKONIS: These day and night cycles are totally disorienting. I feel like we've been here for days, but it's only been how long?
ROBY: About four hours.
STANDARD: I'm sorry to say it looks like you were right in the first place, Martin. We never should have landed here.
ROBY: Look, I'm not trying to rub anybody's nose in anything. The important thing is just to get away from here as fast as possible.
STANDARD: I can't lean on Faust any harder -- he's been working non-stop on the engines.
ROBY: If we knew exactly what happened to the beings on the other ship --
MELKONIS: We do know that.
ROBY: Yeah?
MELKONIS: They never made it off the planet. The parasites won.
ROBY: Where did the parasites come from?
STANDARD: They seem native to the planet. It's got an atmosphere and a dense gravity. It's dead now, but once it must have been fertile.
MELKONIS: No. It's just too small to support fauna as big as the parasites. If there were a native ecology, it would have to be microscopic.
ROBY: Couldn't the pyramid have been built here by space travellers?
STANDARD: Too primitive. It's a pre- technological construction. That slab was engineered by an Iron-Age culture at best.
MELKONIS: They're from a dead civilization; they're spores from a tomb. God knows how long they've been here.
