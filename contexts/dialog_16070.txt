RAY: One of the new kids said they're farming those acres just north of the swamp. He said he saw a crop duster flying around the place.
CLAUDE: I'm not in the mood right now, Ray.
RAY: He said they keep it parked out behind the barn. Can't be that hard to fly a plane. Lots of people do it.
CLAUDE: They're called pilots! I'm serious, Ray. I'm not in the mood for one of your stupid, fucked-up plans right now.
RAY: I don't see you coming up with any plans.
CLAUDE: My plan is on his way to Pittsburgh right now. That congenital idiot just got himself a pardon signed by the governor thanks to us, but we can't seem to do nothing for ourselves. Don't you feel a little disgusted right now?
RAY: Crop duster.
CLAUDE: I ain't getting in no airplane with you. I'm finally wrapping my mind around the concept. They threw us in this shithole for life. Don't you get it, Ray? We're gonna die here! Might as well head up to the cemetery, pick a plot and start digging.
RAY: My daddy died in prison. He gave up hope and hung himself. What you're talking about is the same damn thing. That ain't how I'm going.
CLAUDE: Maybe you're fooling yourself, Ray. Maybe you're just a chip off the old block.
RAY: Take that back or we ain't friends no more, Claude Banks.
CLAUDE: Here's a news flash, Ray. We never were friends. We've just been stuck together for 12 years. It's been nothing but bad luck since the moment I ran into you. Every time I look at you I get sick to my stomach thinking about what my life could have been if I'd never bumped into Ray Gibson.
RAY: Better watch yourself Claude, before you say something you regret.
CLAUDE: The only thing I regret is the day I met you.
RAY: Well, if that's the way it is...
CLAUDE: That's the way it is.
RAY: Then I have nothing left to say to you.
