Advice for following up with a recruiter
I am a mechanical engineer. I have been in contact with a recruiter from a company I am interested in. We have had a pretty steady back and forth email chain discussing potential opportunities with the company, and he has shown genuine interest in helping me find a position there. I haven't heard from him in about a week. I'm assuming he, and the company, are dealing with the fallout from coronavirus, quarantine, etc.

I want to send a follow up email to show I'm still interested, while still showing understanding about the situation we're all in. Below is the draft I have so far. I would appreciate any advice/feedback on how I might revise or rewrite this. Thank you in advance.

"Hi \[recruiter\],

I understand that this is a difficult time and that hiring processes may be disrupted due to the preventative measures taking place. In the meantime, please let me know if I can help in any way.

I hope all is well.

Sincerely,

\[me\]"
