Passion vs Personality
Which one of these is more important in deciding a career. For example I am passionate about economics and would love to be an economist. Now my personality is such where I don't really care about money, and so job security is important. 

Now this leads me to think of options that are less risky with decent job security like accounting. Is it wrong to say that deciding careers based on your personality is better, or pursuing your passion.
