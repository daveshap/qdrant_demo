What happens if I add a single quark to a system of hadrons? In pure QCD in the confinement phase what happens if I add to a system of baryons, which are quarks in the condensed phase, another quark? It doesn't have any quark or antiquark to form a baryon or a meson so how does confinement work in this case?
