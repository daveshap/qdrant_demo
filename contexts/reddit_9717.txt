Re-Opening A Search
I recently had a phone interview that I thought went fairly well. I was told I would hear if I was being invited to campus in around 2 weeks. About 3 days after my interview, the job posting was reactivated with a note saying the search was re-opened. 

Has anybody been involved in a search like this? Does it generally just mean they didnâ€™t find anyone they liked through phone interviews?
