Automator to get PDF Annotations and export to Excel I'm trying to make a macOS service using Automator to extract PDF annotations and get the information into an Excel file.I can successfully get the annotations from a PDF, and export them to a text file. But if I try to parse the same information to a new Excel file, all the information is pasted into a single cell.What would be the correct steps in Automator, to have each text line in separated Excel rows?
