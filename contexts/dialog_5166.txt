UGARTE: Thank you. Will you have a drink with me please?
RICK: No.
UGARTE: I forgot. You never drink with... I'll have another, please. You despise me, don't you?
RICK: If I gave you any thought, I probably would.
UGARTE: But why? Oh, you object to the kind of business I do, huh? But think of all those poor refugees who must rot in this place if I didn't help them. That's not so bad. Through ways of my own I provide them with exit visas.
RICK: For a price, Ugarte, for a price.
UGARTE: But think of all the poor devils who cannot meet Renault's price. I get it for them for half. Is that so parasitic?
RICK: I don't mind a parasite. I object to a cut-rate one.
UGARTE: Well, Rick, after tonight I'll be through with the whole business, and I am leaving finally this Casablanca.
RICK: Who did you bribe for your visa? Renault or yourself?
UGARTE: Myself. I found myself much more reasonable.
