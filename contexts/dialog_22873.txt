MILLER: Reiben, I want you to listen closely to Jackson. This is the way to gripe. Jackson, continue.
JACKSON: Yes, sir. It seems to me, sir, that the entire resources of the United States Army oughta be dedicated to one thing and one thing only, and that is to put me and this here weapon on a rooftop, smack-dab in the middle of Berlin, Germany. Now I ain't one to question decisions made up on high, sir, but it seems to me that saving one private, no matter how grievous the losses of his family, is a waste of my God-given talent.
MILLER: Wade?
WADE: Hell, I don't mind this mission, sir, as long as there's something up at Ramelle for...
REIBEN: ...for you to blow up, yeah, yeah, we heard that.
MILLER: Upham?
UPHAM: Pass.
MILLER: Sarge?
