Has anyone felt they've bombed an interview only to get the job? What happened, and how long did it take to get an offer?
Today, I feel I bombed a very important interview. I got thrown by a question, which set the course of the interview. I feel I rambled through some answers, but I did make sure to circle back and answer it briefly. I've done worse, but I wanted this job, and feel I didn't do as well as I could've. I'd be very interested to hear some stories of this that end in a successful offer. Also, if you accepted it, how did you like working there?
