NOVOGROD: The rank-and-file in the FBI feel he is FBI, but others feel he is a CIA man who knows how to destroy FBI files.
SKRAPINOV: That could be possible...
NOVOGROD: But we are quite certain, comrade, that this man Gardiner is a leading member of an American elitist faction planning a coup d'etat.
SKRAPINOV: A coup d'etat! Of course, that was foreseen by Lenin himself!
NOVOGROD: That is correct, Comrade Skrapinov. We have ascertained that Gardiner heads a big-business power group that will soon be taking over the American government.
SKRAPINOV: Big business. I could work with that faction quite nicely, Colonel Novogrod.
NOVOGROD: You have proven that already, Comrade Skrapinov, you are to be congratulated for recognizing the importance of this man and establishing an early friendship.
SKRAPINOV: Thank you, Colonel.
NOVOGROD: Let us toast to the success of the coup.
