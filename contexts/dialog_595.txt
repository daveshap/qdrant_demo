MARTHA: Sister Paul was in her eighties? Did she climb up here often?
AGNES: No, only when she felt like it. She brought me up here last winter and the next day she died.
MARTHA: No wonder... wait... Agnes... Agnes how do you feel about babies?
AGNES: Oh, they frighten me, I'm afraid I'll drop them. They have a soft spot on their heads and if you drop them so they land on their heads they become stupid. I was dropped on my head, that's why I don't understand things.
MARTHA: Like what?
AGNES: Numbers... you can spend your whole life counting and never reach the end.
MARTHA: I don't understand them either. Do you suppose I was dropped on my head?
AGNES: I hope not. It's a terrible thing to be dropped on your head.
MARTHA: Oh, I've got to give up smoking. Agnes ... wait a minute... Agnes slow down.
