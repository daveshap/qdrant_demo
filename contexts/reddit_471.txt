help me fellow depressed teens of reddit
I am a 16 year old teen thats turning 17 in two days. Ive changed schools 9 times since kindergarten. Due to some shitty circumstances my aunt(on father's side) and grandmother(mothers side) have joint custody of me. I used to live in Kentucky and went to a school where I got good grades, had good friends, and had relationships with the teachers (like a mentor/mentee) but my aunt had decided that I should go live with my grandmother and said if I didnt like it I could come back. Ive been down here for 4 months and am 2 weeks into school going onto 3rd and she has said that i cant come back. I have a past with depression and so far it's come back to kick my ass. Ive tried to make the best of it by going to school and trying to do what was needed. Now no offense to any florida natives but your schools make suicide prevention seem like a fucking heaven, the kids at the school are assholes and havn't even tried to communicate with me and despite my best efforts to communicate with them I'm left feeling that they just dont give 2 shits about me, the teachers here have a huge tendency to distance themselves from students and make having a mentor/mentee relationship feel like a kill yourself already relationship. I REALLY NEED ADVICE BECAUSE I AM DROWNING IN THIS SHIT and all my support is back in kentucky telling my aunt she is an idiot. Now before people say anything I want to point out, I dont do bad shit, neither of my parents can take care of me, there is a portion of the story that just can't be written down do to all the typing id have to do, and I dont need corny advice like just be yourself or give it time, ive had a shitty life and id like to keep the highschool part of it from being fucked into a gaping mess because I cant take the environment down here.
