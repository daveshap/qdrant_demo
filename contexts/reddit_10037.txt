MBTI and First-Year Pairings
We are having a student put together a proposal for our first-year pairing process that, on top of the necessary housing information (medical, quiet preference, etc) and typical roommate questions "do you like to stay up late?", would use the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) as a way to better match students as roommates. 

Do you feel that there is validity to using MBTI for this process? Do you use something similar? 

Edit: Here is the chart the student provided for me. I'm still working on the source. http://i.imgur.com/mDd6gPE.png
