LAURA: So, how are you?
ROB: Have you slept with him yet?
LAURA: I told you I slept with him.
ROB: No, not -- I mean have you, you know --
LAURA: Is that why you wanted to see me?
ROB: I guess.
LAURA: Oh, Rob. What do you want me to say?
ROB: I want you to say that you haven't, and I want it to be the truth.
