JIM: Nothing is going to happen to you. I won't let it.
LIZ: Leave us ALONE for God's sake! ...Oh, it's Lou.
FERRIE: I'm caught in the middle. They're after me. It's almost over.
LOU: Listen, Dave, why don't we order some room service, have a bite, relax. I'll stay as long as you want.
FERRIE: I don't know who to trust anymore. Yeah, sure I could use a pot of hot coffee and a few packs of Camels. You got anything new in the investigation?
JIM: You mean about the Cubans getting trained north of the lake?
FERRIE: Oh, you got that? Banister's pet project. Getting paid by the government to work against the government. Beautiful. What a mind he had, what a guy, Guy. He had all those files.
JIM: Who was paying you, Dave?
FERRIE: You think I was a getaway pilot for the assassination, don't you?
JIM: I don't know. Were you? Who you scared of, Dave?
FERRIE: Everybody! The Agency. The Mob. The Cubans. Yeah, follow the Cubans. Check them out. Here, in Dallas, Miami. Check out a guy named Eladio del Valle. My paymaster when I flew missions into Cuba - he's somewhere in Miami. You're on the right track.
