Please help me.(Suicide Scare)
My boyfriend is really not coping with the quarantine well at all and I am so terrified he is going to do something. We are not able to see each other at all during this. I’m really scared he is going to hurt himself. Our state just got extended to the thirtieth of may and he is just terrible after the news. What do I do? What can I do? I’m so worried.
