CHULO: Yeah, man. Let's throw a bachelor party with drugs, booze and broads.
O'NEILL: Yeah. Right. All the things that make life worth living.
RICK: Sounds swell... I'm really touched. And my getting married's not gonna change a thing between me and my pals. We're still gonna go bowling on Tuesdays, play cards on Fridays and wear women's clothes on Sunday night. I love you guys... I always will.
GARY: Let's have a toast.
