SAMI: You want the tapes for yourself. You're going to sell them.
AGENT HADLEY: I'm going to retire with a shit-load of money. Find me a small country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the States and live the good life.
SAMI: You didn't have to kill Sophie.
AGENT HADLEY: Yes I did. Lose ends are messy.
SAMI: What about me? Aren't I a loose end?
AGENT HADLEY: When this is over you can say whatever the hell you want. I'll be long gone. Besides, who's going to believe you? You're just a two-bit crook.
SAMI: And you're a dirty cop. At least I don't pretend to be something different than what I am.
