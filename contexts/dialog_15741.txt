CORA: Dear Duncan, my affection is as towards a closest friend. Alice and I depend on you and respect you immensely... I wish they did, but my feelings don't go beyond that. Do you see?
HEYWARD: Isn't respect and friendship, a reasonable basis for a man and woman to be joined? And all else may grow in time...?
CORA: Some say that's the way of it.
HEYWARD: Some"?"
CORA: Cousin Eugenie, my father, but...
HEYWARD: Cora, in my heart, I know once we're joined, we'll be the happiest couple in England. Let those whom you trust, your father, help settle what's best for you. In view of your indecision, why not rely on their advice and judgment as well as mine?
HEYWARD: Will you consider that?
CORA: Yes. Yes, I will.
