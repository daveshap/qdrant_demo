MARY: Yes?
FRANK: Hello, I'm Frank Pierce, from the ambulance last night. I brought your father into the hospital and I just learned some news.
MARY: I'll be right down.
MARY: He's better, isn't he?
FRANK: Well, the doctor says he's showing some movement. It's still early, it might mean nothing, but I thought you'd want to know.
MARY: I knew. I sensed it when I heard your voice.
FRANK: You look so different.
MARY: I know. It's awful, isn't it? Night of the Living Cheerleaders.
FRANK: I think it looks good.
MARY: I was going nuts in that waiting room so I came back to check on my mom.
FRANK: How is she?
MARY: Sleeping.
FRANK: I was just going to get some food. Pizza. Maybe we could.
MARY: You can't kill my father that easy. He'll fight forever. Like with me: hasn't talked to me in three years. But it's okay. Sometimes you have to put things behind you.
FRANK: Be tough to get a taxi here. We can give you a ride if you like.
MARY: Okay.
MARCUS: Who's that?
FRANK: She's the daughter of a cardiac arrest I brought in last night. I told her we'd give her a ride back to Misery. Her father's showing signs of improving.
MARCUS: Oh, Frank, you've got it bad, so much worse than I thought.
FRANK: I'm hungry too. We gotta get some food after this.
MARCUS: God help us, he's hungry too.
