CARTER: No thanks, I'm not thirsty.
BLAKE: It's for your cigarette. I prefer not to contaminate my crime scene with micropollutants.
CARTER: Why am I here?
BLAKE: They said on the phone you were assigned to the Meyers case.
CARTER: With all due respect, detective, you can't go blaming every brutal murder in Illinois on Michael Meyers.
BLAKE: Pamela Whittington was a long time associate of Dr. Loomis. Her home office was ransacked. It was chock full of Loomis' files on Meyers. It'd say that makes Meyers a suspect, wouldn't you?
CARTER: Well, when you put it that way.
BLAKE: Right. So why don't we get on with this investigation?
CARTER: I like a woman who takes control.
