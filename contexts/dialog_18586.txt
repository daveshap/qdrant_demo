NICK: That's what I thought.
ALEX: What?
NICK: It's not just the cable system. It's in the phone system as well, the electronic net. It's everywhere.
ALEX: Nick, what is it.
NICK: Maybe it is alive in a way...some sort of electronic intelligence. It's like a computer virus that developed a personality or something. It's self-replicating...it mimics life.
ALEX: Like the fractals?
NICK: It's growing. Getting stronger. Maybe it's only localized now...
ALEX: ...but then it hits the relay stations...
NICK: Right. And then communication satellites, and then anywhere.
ALEX: Anywhere. We have to stop it from getting out.
NICK: It's already out.
ALEX: The Police, then...
NICK: Give me a break, Alex. What are we going to tell them? Excuse me, officer, but there's some sort of electronic monster loose in the phone lines. I'd think twice about calling any of those 976 numbers...
ALEX: Then where do we go?!
NICK: I don't know.
ALEX: SLIP-STREAM.
NICK: What?
ALEX: They made ARCADE. It's still a game, right? It thinks like a game. Maybe it still has to play by the rules. Someone had to program it in the first place, didn't they?.
NICK: You mean we learn the rules...
ALEX: And beat it at it's own game.
NICK: You realize that in order to do that, we'd actually have to play the game.
ALEX: I was afraid you'd say that.
