26M in Michigan without health insurance, in desperate need of mental help
Intro: I'm unemployed 26M living in Metro Detroit, Michigan. I'm looking for mental help now because my mental health needs to be checked. I turned 26 years old in the state of Michigan which means I am no longer on my parent's insurance policies anymore.

**Goals: I'd like to receive help and cover the costs in the best way possible.**

Side Notes: My current diagnoses are ADHD, GAD, GDD. Those were given by a psychiatrist's office. I think it's in my best interest to be evaluated by a psychologist.
