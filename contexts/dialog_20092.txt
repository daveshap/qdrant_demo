BYRON: Who's that?
ZACK: Nobody. Just a girl I've been making it with the last couple of weekends.
BYRON: Great ass.
ZACK: Yeah, I sort of thought so myself.
BYRON: Better watch out for that kind, Zackie. You know what they call 'em, don't ya?
ZACK: Yeah, I know.
BYRON: Back east in Newport, Rhode Island, they call 'em the Fall River Debs. In Pensacola, the Mobile Debs. In Norfolk --
ZACK: That what she was... a Norfolk Deb?
BYRON: Who? Aw shit, Zackie, let's not get off on your mother again, please.
ZACK: What if I want to talk about her, pard? What then? You know, that's all I've ever heard from you, since I was a kid... you never want to talk about that, man, and it's important.
BYRON: There's nothing to talk about. Two goddamn times I made it with your old lady. We barely even talked.
ZACK: That's not how she told it. She said you wrote her every week you were away.
BYRON: I wrote. Not every week...
ZACK: She said you told her in every letter how much you loved her, how you wanted to marry her, have children with her...
BYRON: I never said any of that!
ZACK: I found them, pard, and read them myself, right after she did it!
BYRON: Okay, I wrote those things... and yeah, I had big thoughts of getting together with your mom... but when she hit me with being pregnant, I saw who she was. I'd had quiff lay that shit on me before!
ZACK: What did you call her? What did I hear you call her, you son of a bitch?
