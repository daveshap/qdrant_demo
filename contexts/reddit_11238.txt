My dad is trying his best to screw me over [update]
Hey all!

5 months ago I posted [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/whatsbotheringyou/comments/1ki6le/my_dad_is_trying_his_best_to_screw_me_over/) thread. The TL;DR version was that my parents billed a lot of stuff on credit cards I didn't know about and refused to pay it back. I paid it all off myself, and later went after them in court. My Mom and I settled out of court, and she's paid me back 5k/5.2k she owes me. 

My Dad didn't believe he owed me any, so I had to take him to court. The first court case I won, and received a judgement in the amount of $3,600 dollars. Unfortunately, I moved from California to Seattle 3 days after that judgement was entered for my job. He had 30 days to pay me in full, forge a payment plan with the court, or file an appeal. On the 30th day, he filed an appeal. 

That means I had to go back to California to represent my case all over again in front of another judge, in 4 months. Well, that court date was Jan 17th, and I just found out today I won again. The judge even comped me $127 for airfare. Now he once again has 30 days to pay me, and I don't think he can file another appeal. 

But who knows, he might try to find some new way to screw me over.
