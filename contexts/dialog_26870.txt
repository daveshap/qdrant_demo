BETSY: Well, that's not exactly what the Senator has proposed. You might not want to canvass, but there is plenty more other work we need done: Office work, filing, poster hanging.
TRAVIS: I'm a good worker, Betsy mam, a real good worker.
BETSY: If you talk to Tom, he'll assign you to something.
TRAVIS: If you don't mind, mam, I'd rather work for you.
BETSY: Well, we're all working tonight.
TRAVIS: Well, Betsy mam, I drive a taxi at night.
BETSY: Well, then, what is it you exactly want to do?
TRAVIS: If you don't mind, mam, I'd be mighty pleased if you'd go out and have some coffee and pie with me.
BETSY: Why?
TRAVIS: Well, Betsy mam, I drive by this place here in my taxi many times a day. And I watch you sitting here at this big long desk with these telephones, and I say to myself, that's a lonely girl. She needs a friend. And I'm gonna be her friend.
BETSY: I don't know...
TRAVIS: It's just to the corner, mam. In broad daytime. Nothing can happen. I'll be there to protect you.
BETSY: All right. All right. I'm taking a break at four o'clock. If you're here then we'll go to the corner and have some coffee and pie.
TRAVIS: Oh, I appreciate that, Betsy mam. I'll be here at four o'clock exactly. And... ah... Betsy...
BETSY: Yes?
TRAVIS: My name is Travis.
BETSY: Thank you, Travis.
