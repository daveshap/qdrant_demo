Wanted to share this with you guys - I asked out a girl today
(xpost from r/foreveraloneadating)

I was on the train to penn station and I saw a 10/10 girl reading a book and sat next to her. Along the way I asked "good book?" and she said yeah and told me about it. Then, when the train arrived, I said, "I'm sorry but I have to ask I'll hate myself if I don't - you are absolutely gorgeous and you seem really nice; if I gave you my number would you give me a call?" She said sure and took my number.
