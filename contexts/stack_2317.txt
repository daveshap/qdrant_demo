How to blow open secret hole in Brume Tower if I ran out of explosive carrying enemies? In Brume Tower, after the foyer bonfire, I was helping somebody as a phantom and I saw a hole in the wall after the first fume sorcerer that wasn't there in my world.My research seems to indicate that the only way to open this hole is by exploding a barrel-carrier near it.  But all my barrel-carriers are dead beyond their respawning limits.  Can anyone confirm if there is any/no other way to open this hole?   Am I wasting my time trying to get the big demon guy to break it open with his hammer?
