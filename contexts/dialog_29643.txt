REYNARD: Your client is guilty. Don't dick around with me.
REYNARD: Back in the Seventies I spent years putting away gangsters in a Colombian syndicate called the Ochoa". These guys are very dangerous
EDDIE: I'd have that checked, Mr. Reynard.
REYNARD: Now maybe you got this case reopened because you see yourself as a thorn in society's side, or you want to walk into any restaurant in Chinatown and get free dumplings...
EDDIE: Are you implying that my motives are less than sincere?
REYNARD: Yes, but that's not the issue. What's on your wish list, Ed? Pleading Kim out to first degree man on both homicides, with an agreed sentence of 15 to life running concurrent? Come on... What're you looking for here?

REYNARD: You're my only problem, Ed. What does it take to make you go away?
