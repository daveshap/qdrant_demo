SHAKE: I'm adjusting the decibels on the inbalance.
NORM: Clever. George.
NORM: Look after him.
RINGO: But...
NORM: Do I have to raise me voice?
RINGO: Oh, all right. Come here, Grandad.
GRANDFATHER: Will you ever look at him, sitting there wid his hooter scraping away at that book!
RINGO: Well ... what's the matter with that?
GRANDFATHER: Have you no natural resources of your own? Have they even robbed you of that?
RINGO: You can learn from books.
GRANDFATHER: Can you now? Aah ... sheeps' heads! You learn more by getting out there and living.
RINGO: Out where?
GRANDFATHER: Any old where ... but not our little Richard ... oh no! When you're not thumping them pagan skins, you're tormenting your eyes wid that rubbish!
RINGO: Books are good!
GRANDFATHER: Parading's better!
RINGO: Parading?
GRANDFATHER: That's it, parading the streets ... trailing your coat ... bowling along ... living!
RINGO: Well, I <U>am</U> living, aren't I?
GRANDFATHER: You're living, are you? When was the last time you gave a girl a pink-edged daisy? When did you last embarrass a sheila wid your cool appraising stare?
RINGO: Eh ... you're a bit old for that sort of chat, aren't you?
GRANDFATHER: At least I've a backlog of memories, but all you've got is that book!
RINGO: Aaah ... stop picking on me... you're as bad as the rest of them.
GRANDFATHER: So you <U>are</U> a man after all.
RINGO: What's that mean?
GRANDFATHER: Do you think I haven't noticed ... do you think I wasn't aware of the drift? Oh ... you poor unfortunate scuff, they've driven you into books by their cruel, unnatural treatment, exploiting your good nature.
RINGO: Oh ... I dunno.
GRANDFATHER: And that lot's never happier than when they're jeering at you ... and where would they be without the steady support of your drum beat, I'd like to know.
RINGO: Yeah ... that's right.
GRANDFATHER: And what's it all come to in the end?
RINGO: Yeah ... what's in it for me?
GRANDFATHER: A book!
RINGO: Yeah ... a bloomin' book!
GRANDFATHER: When you could be out there betraying a rich American widow or sipping palm wine in Tahiti before you're too old like me. A fine neat and trim lad the class of you should be helping himself to life's goodies before the sands run out. Being an old age pensioner's a terrible drag on a man and every second you waste is bringing you nearer the Friday queue at the Post Office.
RINGO: Yeah ... funny really, 'cos I'd never thought of it but being middle-aged and old takes up most of your time, doesn't it?
GRANDFATHER: You're only right.
RINGO: I'm not wrong.
GRANDFATHER: Where are you off to?
RINGO: I'm going parading before it's too late!
GEORGE: Eh, Ringo, do you know what happened to me?
RINGO: No. I don't.
