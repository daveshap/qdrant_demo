How to keep the anonymity of people attending a regular event taking place at the same location everytime? In my setting, a handful of characters have to attend a daily event (such as classes). They do so anonymously, as attending this event could endanger their civilian life if the wrong people were to discover their identities.Continuing with the example of classes, this event happens always at the same place, at the same time. On site, people are masked and use names different from their own. The location is adequately secured; the risk of intrusion is low. Thus, during the event, their identity is mostly safe.However, following one attendee before or after said event could lead someone to this person's home, endangering their anonymity.How could a group of people conceal their daily trip to a location with a predictable starting and ending time?The technological level is roughly the same as our own (near future).These people aren't criminal (though it could be a case where this question applies).People interested in their identities would work alone or in a small group, no larger than the attendees.People tracking the attendees can't do it openly, as it would ruin the value of the information.Attendees live in a big city, and their method of transportation is up to the answerer (public or private transports).Facilities for the event may include specifically designed installations (such as mazes, secret doors/access).Event hosts have access to moderately-sized human resources to ensure anonymity.
