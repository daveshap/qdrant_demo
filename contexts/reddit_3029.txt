I cry in the office bathroom everydqy. What can i do about the below situation at work?
Since January, my social life at work has been horrible. It is impacting my work and I cry in the bathroom at work almost twice daily.

I have tried to think a lot why my teammates are behaving in that manner with me.

Earlier the whole team used to go for lunch together and I was included too. For tea/snacks some groups went together. I would join 2 girls at work. Since past few months, they lied to me that they are not going for tea but they did. They used to spend 30 minutes for tea and lie to me about that. I was fine with it. I tried to ask them for tea myself but they did not include me anymore despite my attempts. 
This has not escalated to lunch. They have stopped calling me for lunch from this Monday. So I have to sit alone the whole day at work. From what I see, one girl did not like me and it seems everyone is supporting and believing what she is telling. I honest have no idea what I have done. I tried to recollect my behaviour and actions and can't seem to think any wrong doing.

Can someone please suggest what I can do? I dread going to work now.
