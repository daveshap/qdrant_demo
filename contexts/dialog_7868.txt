BELA: Shh! I'm coming! I will feed you!
ED: Well... I guess I should go. Perhaps we could get together again?
BELA: Certainly. But now the children of the night are calling me.
ED: Sweetie, you won't believe it! I've got the most incredible news!
DOLORES: You got the job?!!
ED: Huh?! Oh, uh, no, I didn't get the job. But something <u>better</u> happened!
DOLORES: Better than not getting a job?
ED: Yeah! I met a movie star! Somebody <u>really big</u>!
DOLORES: Who? Robert Taylor?!
ED: No! A horror movie star!
DOLORES: Boris Karloff!?
ED: Close! The <u>other</u> one!
DOLORES: You met Basil Rathbone!
ED: Oh, the hell with you. I met BELA LUGOSI!
DOLORES: I thought he was dead.
ED: No! He's very alive. Well... sort of. He's old, and frail -- but he's still Bela Lugosi! And he's really nice.
DOLORES: Boy, I can't even remember the last time he was in a picture.
ED: It's a shame. He's such a rest actor, and nobody uses him anymore.
DOLORES: So did you get his autograph?
