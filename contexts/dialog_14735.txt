BLATTIS: Alright, gentlemen, I'm gonna leave you. I got a couple of questions for the paper, Serg- eant? Mind if I swing by later, wring out a tea-bag with you?
BERLIN: My pleasure .. Who's Popeye?
BLATTIS: Your predecessor. He did- n't like to get outta bed. Catch you later, Freddy T ..
BERLIN: So what happened to the barbecues, and fishing?
ROSS: Watch my lips, coz you're not gonna believe this - <u>this</u> is a rare occurrence. We haven't had a body in eighteen months.
BERLIN: What about that kid, Ross?
ROSS: Oh, shit. Of course. The kid. <u>Travis</u>. Find that kid and get the knife off him. He's gonna lie to you - but he's got it - so <u>get</u> it. Well, go on, get on with it. Whatta you staring at?
TRAVIS: I think I found some- thing horrible, Sir
ROSS: Whatta you mean, horrible?""
TRAVIS: I think I've found a hand.
