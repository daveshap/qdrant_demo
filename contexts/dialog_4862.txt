AARON: He must have been great-looking, right?
JANE: Why do you say that?
AARON: Because nobody invites a bad- looking idiot to their bedroom.
AARON: Okay. Let's do me.
JANE: Sure.
AARON: Okay. I feel like I'm slipping but do people who are actually slipping feel that way or is it always the really good people who are moving up who invariably think they're slipping because their standards are so high?
JANE: This conversation is not worthy of you.
AARON: I'd give anything if that were true.
JANE: Good night.
AARON: Wouldn't this be a great world if insecurity and desperation made us more attractive? If needy were a turn-on?
JANE: Call if you get weird.
