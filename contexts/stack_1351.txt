Alternatives to pig-tailing ground wires in outlet box? I have an old house and there are ungrounded outlets set in the baseboards. I am currently working on rewiring them and was wondering what the best way to tie the ground wires to each other and the ground screw is. From looking online, it seems to be using a pig tail, but these boxes are very shallow and I don't think I can fit a deeper one in there. So are there any safe alternatives?
