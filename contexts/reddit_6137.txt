What do you think of shifting schedules? Iâ€™d like to hear your opinions.
(Is this the right flair?)

I applied for this position as an Investor Communications Specialist (ICS) for a multinational print and digital communications company. The pay is high, but it requires shifting schedules every 1/2/3 months; basically, there is a day shift, night shift, and graveyard shift. I am really inclined to work as an ICS because the responsibility as one interests me, and the company is dynamic and flexible. (They immediately bought laptops for their employees for them to work from home.) My only problem is the shifting schedules.

TL;DR: interesting role, high salary, generous company BUT shifting schedule.

What do you think?
