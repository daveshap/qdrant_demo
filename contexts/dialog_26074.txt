LENNY: No. I suppose not. I didn't know you were colorblind, Max.
MAX: Only way I could stand your ties.
MAX: I'll have that. Glock 22. Nice.
LENNY: Where's Faith?
MAX: I sent her to the party. I figured I'd wait up here until you killed Tran.
LENNY: What makes you think I'm gonna kill Tran?
MAX: You just did.
LENNY: Jesus!
MAX: You know, statistically that's the second most common word people say right before they die. Shit being number one.
LENNY: So... I killed Tran. Then you ran in, being on his payroll, and shot me.
MAX: That's pretty much the way it happened.
LENNY: Wait a minute. Now I'm remembering. I killed Iris too, didn't I?
MAX: That's right. They'll find the original of her snuff clip in your apartment. The one I left for you at the club was a copy.
LENNY: Was I a really busy guy? Did I do Tick too?
MAX: You bet. Did you like it?
