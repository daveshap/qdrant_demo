ELIZABETH: What a strange fellow.
FREDDY: Yes, he's a little bit... tilted. Harmless, though.
ELIZABETH: Why does he call you 'master'?
FREDDY: Are you suggesting I call him master???
ELIZABETH: No, of course not. I just meant...
FREDDY: All right then!
MAITRE D': Yes, sir, name, please?
MONSTER: Food!
MAITRE D': Do you have a reservation?
MONSTER: Food!!
MAITRE D': I'm sorry, sir. We only seat by reservation.
MONSTER: Drink!
MAITRE D': Oh, no sir-ee. If yo don't have a reservation you can skip to ma-loo.
MONSTER: Foooooood!
MAITRE D': Now just one moment. There's no need for roughhousing. Have you ever tried a tip?
MONSTER: GRRRHMMNNNJKJMMMNN!
MAITRE D': Franz! Help! Lunatic!
FREDDY: Poor Delbruck! There must be some way to reach him -- to control that body.
ELIZABETH: Darling, you mustn't worry so.
FREDDY: But there's a genius inside that body -- crying out for love and understanding and normal human relationships. I just have to find some way to re-establish his communications system.
ELIZABETH: But you can't do that at night. And even if you could -- it would cost a fortune. Come to bed, darling.
FREDDY: Oh, Delbruck, Delbruck. Was will dien tachlas von Dir?
ELIZABETH: You've done everything that's humanly possible, Frederick. Oh, darling, I'm so worried about you -- you need rest.
FREDDY: I suppose you're right.
ELIZABETH: Of course I am. Now come along like a good boy.
