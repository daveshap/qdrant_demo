How do I bring unique qualities and traits to the position to stand out?
I don't have any experience in tech, but that's where I want to work.

Is something like my personal outlook on life considered a unique quality or trait that would be beneficial to a position?

Let's say, I'm a very open minded person, so I enjoy reading many types of material and looking at both sides of stories. This type of thinking, I believe, is exceptionally beneficial for tech jobs like programming because programming is all about solving problems. The best way to solve a problem is by looking at it in as many ways as possible to see what could be the best way to solve it. Someone who lives in a bubble and doesn't explore many things in life wouldn't benefit from seeing a problem in many ways, as I would from the explorations that I experience. 

Or are unique qualities just the boring, I know Java and C++, and that makes me stand out. Or rather, I've built Pac-Man with c# in Unity kind of quality that would make me stand out?
