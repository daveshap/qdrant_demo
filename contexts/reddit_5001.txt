Need a friend
I’ve seen this sub for quite some time, but never posted before. I’ve been feeling very down lately. I feel worthless and unmotivated. I’m starting to hate my self, I fell like I’m a burden to the people I love. I’m feeling hopeless and alone. I used to have few close friends, but had become distant. And the friend I was closest to has stop talking to me. I feel alone and in need to talk to someone. To talk on how I feel and to take my mind off my problems. Thank for reading
