I'm under so much emotional stress.
I'm 16, I just started a new job, I was suspended from school and I have to go to court because I was scared for myself and ended up getting arrested. Meeting with a lawyer, school hearing, and my job are conflicting with each other. I met a sweet girl and she makes me so happy but I fucked up when we got on a certain subject and I told her a story that sorta shocked her and she later texted me that she thinks she doesn't want to date anybody at the moment but she really likes me. My dad and his girlfriend are constantly fighting whenever I visit him.

I've been having cluster headaches. I'm going to have a fucking aneurism. And don't ask why I got arrested, just help me from having a mental breakdown.
