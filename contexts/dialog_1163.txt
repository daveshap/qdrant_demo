LORL: Oh, thank you, sir.
SALIERI: Do any pupils come to the house?
LORL: Not that I've seen.
SALIERI: Then how does he pay for all this? Does he work at all?
LORL: Oh, yes, sir, all day long. He never leaves the house until evening. He just sits there, writing and writing. He doesn't even eat.
SALIERI: Really? What is it he's writing?
LORL: Oh, I wouldn't know that, sir.
SALIERI: Of course not. You're a good girl. You're very kind to do this. Next time you're sure they'll be out of the house, let me know, will you?
