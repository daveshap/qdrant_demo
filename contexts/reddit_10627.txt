I wish there was a 'stop existing' button
I was gonna cut down to an artery this easter but my dumbass thought that it would be a good idea to make a bunch of obvious noticeable self harm cuts on my hand and of course my parents found out and they somehow managed to find my suicide note in my geography copy and they never talked to me about it but my mom showed it to my new therapist when I wasn't in the room. Don't you ever wish you could just disappear without leaving any pain behind like you were never born because god I sure do/// or maybe I'm just being a dramatic attention seeking teenager i don't even know anymore
