PALANTINE: Travis, what single thing would you want the next President of this country to do most?
TRAVIS: I don't know, sir. I don't follow political issues much.
PALANTINE: There must be something...
TRAVIS: Well, he should clean up this city here. It's full of filth and scum. Scum and filth. It's like an open sewer. I can hardly take it. Some days I go out and smell it then I get headaches that just stay and never go away. We need a President that would clean up this whole mess. Flush it out.
PALANTINE: I know what you mean, Travis, and it's not going to be easy. We're going to have to make some radical changes.
TRAVIS: Damn straight.
PALANTINE: Nice talking to you, Travis.
TRAVIS: Thank you, sir. You're a good man, sir.
BETSY: You didn't have to spend your money -- ?
TRAVIS: He'll, what else can I do with it all?
BETSY: Travis, you haven't even played the record?
TRAVIS: Yeah, well my stereo player is broke. But I'm sure the record is OK.
BETSY: Your stereo broke? God, I could hardly stand that. I live on music.
TRAVIS: I don't follow music much. I'd like to though. Honest.
BETSY: So you haven't heard this record yet?
TRAVIS: No. I thought maybe you could play it for me on your player.
BETSY: What are you doing?
TRAVIS: I bought a couple of tickets.
BETSY: But this is a porno movie.
TRAVIS: No, these are the kind that couples go to. They're not like the other movies. All kinds of couples go. Honest. I've seen them.
TRAVIS: Damn.
BETSY: What's wrong?
TRAVIS: I forgot to get the Coca-Cola.
TRAVIS: Where are you going?
BETSY: I'm leaving.
TRAVIS: What do you mean?
BETSY: These are not the kind of movies I go to.
TRAVIS: Well, I don't follow movies too much...
BETSY: You mean these are the only kind of movies you go to?
TRAVIS: This is sort of high class...
BETSY: I mean porno movies.
TRAVIS: Well... mostly...
BETSY: My God!
TRAVIS: We can go to another movie if you like, I don't care. I got money. There's plenty...
