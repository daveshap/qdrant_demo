ROGER RABBIT: Hey, don't I get an encore?
VALIANT: Why, you crazy Toon... I've been out there riskin' my neck for you. I come back here and you're singin' and dancin'.
ROGER RABBIT: But that's my calling, my purpose, my raison d'etre. Toons are supposed to make people laugh... and believe me, those people needed a laugh.
VALIANT: And when they're done laughin' , they're gonna call the cops. That guy Angelo would rat on you for a nickel!
ROGER RABBIT: Angelo? He's a pal, a chum...
VALIANT: An arsonist and a kidnapper. He just got outta prison.
ROGER RABBIT: Well... I still don't think he'd turn me in.
VALIANT: Just because you got 'em to laugh?
ROGER RABBIT: A laugh can be a powerful thing, Eddie. Sometimes it's the only weapon we have in life.
VALIANT: I think I prefer the Smith and Wesson variety.
ROGER RABBIT: I've met some cynical and miserable humans in my time. But you, Edward Valiant, are positively funereal!
VALIANT: Well, right now it's gonna be your funereal.
