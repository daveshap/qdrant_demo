Switch careers to pay off loan?
just graduated with a degree in kinesiology and I got a 70k debt for it. I’m in a huge rut. Regardless of what mistakes I made, I need a plan to fix this. I don’t have a high enough GPA to do post grad near me and going abroad is out of the option. And the job opportunity and pay for kin is laughable. 

So I need advice on what career I should look into that I can learn relatively quickly to pay off my loan on a useless degree. I was thinking about learning code-getting into the computer field,  or go into a skilled labour trade. 

At the end of the day I love the health care field and helping people. I plan on going back to health care once I get my financial situation managed. But for now I need just money, I don’t care what type of job it is. Your advice and experience will be greatly appreciated.
