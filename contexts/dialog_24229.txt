ICHABOD: Only if I repeat them outside this room. And, I will if I must... Out there, for all to hear. Or... you may speak, as planned. But, you tell them you feel compelled to move on to greener pastures.
FATHER STEENWYCK: No. You will not run me out. No one will believe a word of what you say.
ICHABOD: Oh? Far as I can tell, a rumor does not travel alone for long here.
FATHER STEENWYCK: Are you a deist? Is that it? A free thinker who does not believe in divinity.
ICHABOD: It is only important what you are. An adulterer...
FATHER STEENWYCK: I am the Lord's voice in this town.
ICHABOD: Wallowing in sin and lust...
FATHER STEENWYCK: They need guidance.
ICHABOD: Wallowing quite literally in blood.
FATHER STEENWYCK: Damn you, sir! God damn you to hell!
ICHABOD: He may. But, not soon enough for you, and not on your behalf.
ICHABOD: You are so upset now... and yet, you seemed in such good spirits last night.
FATHER STEENWYCK: You cannot do this. I am a man of God!
ICHABOD: Climb to the top of the tallest ladder you can find, Father. That is the closest you ever come to God.
