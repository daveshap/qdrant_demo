TRAPPER: Don't you use olives?
DUKE: Where you think you are, boy? They probably never seen a olive in this country.
HAWKEYE: That's the front up the road a few miles. We have to get by without some of the comforts of home.
TRAPPER: I like an olive.
HAWKEYE: Jesus to Jesus and eight hands around! Duke, did I ever tell you how I beat Dartmouth by intercepting a pass?
DUKE: Sixteen times.
HAWKEYE: We didn't have a chance, little Androscoggin College against the Big Green, but there was this blizzard and we held then nothing nothing till the last twenty seconds. Then this great passer of theirs let one go, snow and all...
TRAPPER: Lucky you didn't have your mouth open or it would have gone down your throat.
HAWKEYE: He's Trapper John! Only man in history who ever found fulfillment in the ladies' can of a Boston and Maine Railroad car! When the Conductor caught him in there with his Winter Carnival date, she screamed: 'He trapped me!' What have you been doing since those days, Trapper?
