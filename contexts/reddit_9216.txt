Thankful for frozen pizzas
For context: I work 50+ hours a week so my pregnant wife can stay at home with our toddler. 

Money is tight, but one thing we always try to keep in a freezer is a frozen pizza. 

There have been so many times when I get off work and I'm tired, she's tired, neither of us have the energy to cook or shop.

That ~$5 frozen pizza has prevented us from spending $15-$20 on takeout SO many times. 

I know it isn't the healthiest option, and may not be even the cheapest option,  but some nights,  it's a lifesaver.
