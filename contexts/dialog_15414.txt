PETER: Hello.
CALLER: Last night was very exciting, wasn't it? Have you figured out what I'm doing?
PETER: You're playing the Tarakoss opening.
CALLER: Very good.
PETER: You're next move should have been e2- e3.
CALLER: I used a variation. You should have anticipated that. Have you figured out the message?
PETER: What word did you leave last night?
CALLER: The police haven't told you?
PETER: They think that you and I are doing this together.
CALLER: Interesting concept. I hadn't thought of that. If you think about how Anton Berger plays chess you might get it.
PETER: I'm beginning to think it doesn't mean anything. Remember eventually revenge- -
CALLER: --you're hopeless! You can't even read a sentence! Didn't they teach you punctuation in school? The game ends tonight!
KATHY: Remember eventually revenge is carefully... Have you tired juxtaposing the words?
ANDY: Oh, c'mon. We're not going to spend any more time on this crap, are we? It doesn't mean anything. It's Sanderson!
KATHY: It isn't him. Frank, you brought me in on this in the beginning because you wanted my opinion if he was capable of doing this.
ANDY: Jesus, you're sleeping with the guy. You've lost your perspective. You can't possibly be unbiased.
FRANK: He's right, Kathy.
KATHY: What are you saying? That I'm seeing what I want to see? That I'm protecting a murderer? What?
FRANK: We can't rely on your judgement anymore.
KATHY: What does that mean?
