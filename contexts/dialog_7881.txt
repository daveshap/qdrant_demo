MR. FELDMAN: Mr. Ward, it's a delight to meet you.
ED: It's Wood. Ed Wood.
MR. FELDMAN: Wood? Ward? Wood. Hey, what do you know. It <u>is</u> Wood. Dang secretaries, you can never get a good one. Right?
MR. FELDMAN: So what are you bringing me? Looks like you got some film cans.
ED: Well, Mr. Feldman, some people have resumes to show. I've got my own movie.
MR. FELDMAN: Really?! Well good for you.
ED: I just made this picture, over at Screen Classics. It opens next week.
MR. FELDMAN: Screen Classics? Hmm, don't know them.
ED: Nobody in town has seen it, so I'm givin' you first crack at my talents.
MR. FELDMAN: I can't wait to take a look. So what's up next?
ED: Well, Mr. Feldman, I don't believe in thinking small. So I've got a whole slate of pictures for you: The Vampire's Tomb
MR. FELDMAN: Doctor Acula? I don't get it.
ED: <u>Dr. Acula</u>!
MR. FELDMAN: Oh, Dr. Acula." I get it. I don't like it."
ED: But Bela Lugosi's in it!
MR. FELDMAN: Lugosi's washed-up. What else you got?
ED: Well... I've got another project I wasn't gonna tell you about. Lugosi's in it, but he's got a smaller part. The lead is an ingenue, a sterling young actress named Dolores Fuller. The title is Bride Of The Atom.""
MR. FELDMAN: Ah! Atomic Age stuff, huh? I like it. I'll tell you what, Mr. Ward. Why don't you leave those film cans, and my associates and I will take a look at your little opus. Maybe we can do business together.
