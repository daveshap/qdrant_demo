Offered job (written) in March. Still no start date and I haven't really been updated since. Is it time to give up?
Like the title says I was offered a job back in March, right before everything went downhill.

My training was scheduled April 1st, and I received a voicemail the weekend before saying it had been postponed. At the time I wasn't surprised and told them I understood, etc. 

But now, my status has hardly been updated since then. I've tried emailing the HR head, no one ever got back to me. I managed to get in touch with the receptionist a week ago and she said there was a hiring freeze and to hang tight, but at this point I'm losing hope.

I know I shouldn't be this attached to a job, but considering what is going on right now I'm really hoping this job comes around. What should I do? This is extremely frustrating because this wasn't just a second interview, I signed all of the paperwork, did the drug test and the whole nine yards. My state is entering phase 2 on Friday, should I call Monday or just send (yet another) email to the HR head? Or should I just give up entirely?
