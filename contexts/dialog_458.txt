CATFISH: Howdy, y'all. Hey, Lindsey! I'll be damned! You shouldn't be down here sweet thing, ya'll might run ya stockings.
LINDSEY: Couldn't stay away. You running mixture for us? Good. Couldn't ask for better.
CATFISH: Okay, here we go. Start equalizing, y'all.
LINDSEY: Get comfortable. The bad news is we got six hours in this can, blowing down. The worse news is it's gonna take us three weeks to decompress back to the surface later.
COFFEY: We've been fully briefed, Mrs. Brigman.
LINDSEY: Don't call me that, okay... I hate that. Alright, from now on we watch each other closely for signs of HPNS...
MONK: High-Pressure Nervous Syndrome. Muscle tremors, usually in the hands first. Nausea, increased excitability, disorientation.
LINDSEY: Very good. About one person in twenty just can't handle it. They go buggo. They're no way to predict who's susceptible, so stay alert.
COFFEY: Look, we've all made chamber runs to this depth. We're checked out.
LINDSEY: Oh... chamber runs. Uh huh, that's good. Well, hey... you guys know any songs?
CATFISH: Those guys ain't so tough. I fought plenty of guys tougher'n them.
HIPPY: Now we get to hear about how he used to be a contender.
