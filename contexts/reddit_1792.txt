Couldn’t submit APs rant megathread.
I’ll start: How in the ever-loving
#FUCK 
do you make a CompSci (read: programming) test with CSS *so* shit that you fuck up a submit button, not only so bad that one person can’t submit, but so bad that at least two people in my class alone can’t submit?  The ironic comedy of that is the only thing keeping me sane right now.  The College Board is a scam.

Edit: Okay, I get it.  CSS IsN’t PrOgRaMmInG.  The backend then.
