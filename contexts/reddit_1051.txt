Does anyone else here always feel like they’re in some sort of trouble or someone is upset with them?
I think one of the worse symptoms of my anxiety is that I often feel in “trouble” or like someone is upset with me. 

Usually this will happen after working a shift or leaving classes for the day. 

I end up questioning the things I did or said during the day and if I did everything correctly. Often times these anxieties come up when trying to go to sleep. 

Does anyone else get this? How do you combat the feelings?
