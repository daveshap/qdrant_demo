I've been told if I don't take this voluntary incentive program offered to everyone, I am likely to be laid off (short tenure and very high salary, staff level). Need advice.
I would receive a gross $20,815 over 8 weeks (plus 8 weeks of health benefits), and my PTO payout of approximately $6,500 (this would be paid out either) if I took the voluntary incentive program. Last day would be June 30th. I have attempted to negotiate but since the program is a flat offer for each person by seniority (0-3 years, 4-6 years etc.), they can't negotiate because it would leave them open to questions from those they didn't allow to negotiate (it's a law firm so I'm sure they have legal reasons for this).

If I did get laid off instead, the severence would instead be 3-4 weeks (one month medical) and I am not sure they'd negotiate this either. I have pretty good arguments having led a successful project that impacted each partners' bottom line this year (I am not exaggerating that I was integral and it was extremely important, and I came up with the solutions). They would want me to sign a severance agreement for the Voluntary Program. Unsure if I got laid off if they would want me to sign something or not.

4 weeks would be about $8,000 instead of the $20,815. Unemployment over the max 26 weeks would only pay $13,000-ish in my state and I'd have to deal with re-certifying and waiting.

Would having a layoff on my record be worse than having a resignation? I know the firm can't and won't really say anything either way, just that i was employed through July 1st.

Are there any other considerations I should make as far as how this might affect future salaries and savings ? I'm kind of annoyed that I have to make this decision at all.

I have $15,000 emergency fund and $375,000 in retirement. Age 37/F.
