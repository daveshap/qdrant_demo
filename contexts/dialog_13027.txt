GENERAL BIZIMUNGU: Where are my supplies?
PAUL: I'm sorry, General. The cellar is empty.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU: You have cockroaches dancing on tables and you tell me the cellar is empty? Did they drink my whiskey?
PAUL: No. We have no way of finding other stock but I have money for you from the guests.
