Cutting notch out of tile- least wasteful/ fastest option I have a piece of 12 inch square porcelain tile that I need to cut notch out of one side to fit around doorway. Notch is about 1/3 way down one side and is 4 inches wide by 2 inch deep towards center of tile. I've read where you can use oscillating tool,snap cutter, angle grinder, tile cutter, or tile saw. However, they all seem to have disadvantages- oscillating tool( very,very slow) snap cutter ( chance of breaking tile), angle grinder (very dusty),  tile cutter (hard to make this type cut), and tile saw( cost). Is tile saw really best option?
