MCKINNEY: Soon as I get that bracelet back I'm going to relax. Wish the guy that borrowed it would help me out--I got to win that fifty bucks.
SALLY: I've got a hunch you're going to win that bet, Inspector.
MCKINNEY: I hope so. Well, I guess you two can do without me. I'll be seeing you.
BRETT: I'm going to return the bracelet right now and face the consequences.
SALLY: Jimmy!
BRETT: Well, I'll be--!!!
SALLY: What's the matter?
