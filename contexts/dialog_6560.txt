CATHERINE: Minute flecks were spattered across the seat and steering wheel. The instrument panel was buckled inwards, cracking the clock and the speedometer dials. The cabin was deformed, and there was dust and glass and plastic flakes everywhere inside. The carpeting was damp and stank of blood and other body and machine fluids.
JAMES: You should have gone to the funeral.
CATHERINE: I wish I had. They bury the dead so quickly - they should leave them lying around for months.
JAMES: What about his wife? The woman doctor? Have you visited her yet?
CATHERINE: No, I couldn't. I feel too close to her.
CATHERINE: Renata tells me you're going to rent a car.
JAMES: I can't sit on this balcony forever. I'm beginning to feel like a potted plant.
CATHERINE: How can you drive? James... your legs. You can Barely walk.
JAMES: Is the traffic heavier now? There seem to be three times as many cars as there were before the accident.
CATHERINE: I've never really noticed. Is Renata going with you?
JAMES: I thought she might come along. Handling a car again might be more tiring than I imagine.
CATHERINE: I'm amazed that she'll let you drive her.
JAMES: You're not envious?
CATHERINE: Maybe I am a little. James, I've got to leave for the office. Are you going to be all right?
RENATA: Are we allowed to park here?
JAMES: No.
RENATA: I'm sure the police would make an exception in your case.
JAMES: There's still a patch of blood there on the road. Did you see it?
RENATA: I saw the blood. It looks like motor oil.
JAMES: You were the last one I saw just before the accident. Do you remember? We made love.
RENATA: Are you still involving me in your crash?
