Enjoy being a custodian, don’t enjoy not being able to save any money. Suggestions?
I’m a naturally quiet and reserved person, so after years of stress at work, I took a pay cut to become a custodian in hopes that I would be happier.  I was absolutely right.  I love having tasks to do all night while being left alone with my headphones.  On the flip side, I’m pretty driven and would still like to make decent money at some point.  What path can I take that is based on janitorial aspects but will result in better compensation? Being a lead custodian? Starting a janitorial business? Specializing in flooring? Other?
