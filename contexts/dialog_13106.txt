EVELYN: I gave you a goddamn guest list two pages long -- where the hell are they?
PRICE: Shredded. Sorry. Decided to whip up one of my own: a group so hungry for money that they'd be willing to do anything. I thought you'd be more comfortable with your peers.
EVELYN: I guess it was stupid of me not to expect something this twisted from you. Well, congratu-fucking-lations, Steven: Round One, you win.
PRICE: Well, not quite. See, those people down there: they aren't the ones I invited.
EVELYN: Then who are they?
PRICE: You tell me. I don't know how you managed to hack into my Mac, but: bravo.
EVELYN: What are you talking about? You think I invited them?
PRICE: Sure know it wasn't me. And if you say it wasn't you -- then who the hell did, Evelyn?
EVELYN: It you really loved me, Steven, you'd find a way to drop dead in the next three seconds.
PRICE: Finding ways for me to die at these things is really your deal, isn't it? The O.J." knife with the not-quite- retractable blade? Your "Jim Jones Kool- Aid" that was exactly that?"
EVELYN: All accidents until proven otherwise.
PRICE: You know how happy I'd be if that was really true, Evelyn? And how positively goddamn delirious if you weren't fucking every living thing in our area code at the same goddamn time!
EVELYN: Which part of that fantasy turns you on most: me with other men -- or just the other men?
PRICE: You know everything you do gets me hot.
PRICE: -- just not always in the sexual sense.
EVELYN: You're hurting me.
PRICE: I know.
PRICE: Now, there's the simple country gal I married. Let's go back down and greet your guests -- show them the real you: corny as Kansas on the Fourth of July.
EVELYN: My guests were shredded. It's your sick little scene now, Steven: enjoy. I'm going to go run scalding water on the places you just touched me, and then I'm calling a cab.
