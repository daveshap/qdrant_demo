Global water scarcity: How big a problem is it? What policies are effective at ameliorating it?
Concerns have arisen that ["the world may be running out of fresh water"](http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20170412-is-the-world-running-out-of-fresh-water). Growing populations, along with growing agricultural water usage (which already makes up [80% of used US fresh water](https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/farm-practices-management/irrigation-water-use/)) and supply issues [stemming from global warming](http://www.climatehotmap.org/global-warming-effects/water-supply.html). Overall, demand is expected to increase 50% globally between 2000 and 2050, [mainly](http://www.globalwaterforum.org/2012/05/21/water-outlook-to-2050-the-oecd-calls-for-early-and-strategic-action/) from manufacturing but from domestic and commercial sources as well.

Some regions have already been swamped by water problems: the American state of California has been going through [record drought conditions](https://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/californias-drought/) in recent years, while Australia endured a nearly [decade-long drought](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000s_Australian_drought) at the beginning of the millenium. Additionally,many areas that were historically densely populated have been enduring [desertification](http://www.millenniumassessment.org/documents/document.355.aspx.pdf), in some cases a long term trend exacerbated by human exploitation and climate change. This in turn has threatened existing populations, and at least some scholars believe that desertification may be a [long term cause](http://blogs.worldbank.org/arabvoices/climate-change-conflict-mena) of chronic conflict in regions like the Middle East. 

Many regions have already begun demand-side policies to address the issue: for example, has managed to reduce aggregate residential water use [by half](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-australia-can-teach-the-world-about-surviving-drought/) since their great drought. Other nations have addressed the supply side, some [turning to desalination](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/israel-proves-the-desalination-era-is-here/) while others have engaged in massive [water transfer schemes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South%E2%80%93North_Water_Transfer_Project) from more to less wet parts of their nation. 

Water scarcity seems to be [especially acute](https://publish.illinois.edu/sswpolicy/2015/09/18/the-water-scarcity-in-developing-countries-effects-on-women-and-children/) in developing nations unable to afford many solutions developed nations have implemented. This combined with massively growing populations in these regions suggests that problems may soon emerge.
