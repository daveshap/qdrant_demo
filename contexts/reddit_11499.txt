Because of my short temper, I pushed away the greatest person I have ever met.
My ex-girlfriend broke up with me two months ago. We have been together for 3 years. I feel guilty and sorry about it because I never treated her right. I would always scream at her, said awful things and never listen to her at all. She said it was a nightmare being with me through those years. 

I wanted to get back to her. But she refused and kept saying that the same thing will happen over again. Three years was too long and I didn't do anything to change myself. I still love her and I feel like crap because she doesn't feel the same. I begged for her to give me one more chance. All she remembered was the bad experiences she had with me. There were never any good memories according. I blame myself for being defective, unable to love and be loved. I'm an awful person and I believe that I deserve to be lonely.
