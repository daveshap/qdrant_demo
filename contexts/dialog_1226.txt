DAVID: I'm a werewolf.
ALEX: A werewolf?
ALEX: Are you better now?
DAVID: I'll let you know the next full moon.
ALEX: You're to be discharged tomorrow. Will you be all right?
DAVID: My friend Jack was just here.
ALEX: Your dead friend Jack?
DAVID: Yeah. He says that I will become a monster in two days. What do you think?
ALEX: What do I think? You mean about the possibility of your becoming a monster in two days or about visits from dead friends?
DAVID: I was dreaming again?
ALEX: I would think so.
DAVID: Yeah, I would think so, too.
