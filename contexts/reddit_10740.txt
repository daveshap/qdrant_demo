I wish I could trade places with someone who is dying and wants to live
I feel like this is a super shitty thing to say and probably insensitive... I don’t have anyone to talk to that I can trust and I need to say it somewhere. I desperately want to trade places with someone who has COVID-19 or even like cancer or anything else, so they could get a second chance at life and my suffering could finally be over. I don’t want to be alive and haven’t since I was 11 or 12. It’s not fair that some people who are so full of life and happiness have to die while miserable people like me still exist. I’m a waste of resources and a drain on society. If I was given the opportunity to die in someone’s place I would jump at the chance. Not really looking for responses or anything... just had to put this out there and nobody in my life gives a shit how I feel.
