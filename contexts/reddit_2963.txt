What kind of career can I have despite my criminal record?
I have felony grand theft and grand theft auto. Right now I still have 7 months of probation and I am in college studying animal science. I wanted to be a vet tech but thinking about it I'm not sure any vets office will hire me after a background check. I also wanted to go to school to become a veterinarian.
