BOUNCER: Oh, no, Ray. Not tonight. Spanky's not happy with you.
RAY: Is Spanky here?
BOUNCER: No, but...
RAY: Then what's the problem?
BOUNCER: Do yourself a favor and find another place where they let you in the front door.
RAY: But this is where the action is and I have to be where the action is. Look, when your old lady wanted those alligator shoes, didn't I come through for you? Ain't she stepping in style now?
BOUNCER: Yeah...
RAY: Well, alright then. What do you think about this new tie?
BOUNCER: Sharp.
RAY: I look good tonight. And I feel lucky, too.
