Lawyers: Do you guys like your job? Should I do it?
I’m about to graduate from college with a degree in communications and philosophy and I have no idea what I want to do with my life. I’m just filled with anxiety.

I’ve got an Asian tiger mom pushing me to go into the direction of law because she thinks I’ll not only be good at it, but it’s a reputable and stable career. On the other hand, I’ve got a White cowboy dad who wants me to work in the family businesses he built. They totally hate each other. 

Now I don’t know if any of this is true, but my dad told me that I wouldn’t make enough to support myself comfortably as a lawyer. It’s not guaranteed a high paying job, where as the family business would. Not to mention, the cost of law school. I know this is wrong, but I don’t want to disappoint my mom either. She’s done everything for me and provided me with everything. 

So now I’m thinking law school would be a great educational venture, but idk if I want to be a lawyer. 
Every lawyer I’ve met has said “how can I talk you out of it?”

What does a normal week look like for a lawyer? What do you spend most of your time doing? Do you feel you make an adequate to support a comfortable lifestyle? I’m really open to any advice and thoughts.
