E-Mail Web Client: How to handle credentials I am thinking about building an e-mail web client that I can run on my server as a side project. The server addresses should be configured on the server side.Multiple Accounts should be able to access their emails through the client.As I see it, for POP/IMAP/SMTP the credentials have to be sent with every request, so I need to store them somewhere. What is the most secure way to do this?
