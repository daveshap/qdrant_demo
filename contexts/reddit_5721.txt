Finding a job in my field
Well I’ve been job searching for a while now and I cannot find anything in my field or anything career worthy. I have a bachelors degree in both sports management and business administration. And next may I will have my MBA. I am doing the MBA online so I wanted to get started on something in the event management area. I am having a very hard time finding anything. I’ve been mainly using indeed to job search. What do I need to do to land a job in this area? I feel like I wasted my time getting a degree.
