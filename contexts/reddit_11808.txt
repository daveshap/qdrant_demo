SO starting meds
My SO is starting antidepressants today and I don't really know how to feel about it. I know that it might help them and I support them on whatever helps their depression but I'm scared that it will drastically change their personality. I'm scared they might get addicted or misuse them or even overdose. They told me about it and they're starting on a low dosage and we won't see reactions for a few weeks. If anybody has experienced similar situations, I'd greatly appreciate any advice on coping and adapting to this.
