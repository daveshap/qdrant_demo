STANDARD: What'd he say?
MELKONIS: I couldn't make it out -- too much interference.
HUNTER: I'm getting nowhere. The whole area around the pyramid is dead to transmission. I think we should go after them.
ROBY: No.
HUNTER: What do you mean, no?
ROBY: We're not going anywhere.
HUNTER: But they don't know about the translation! They could be in danger right now.
ROBY: We can't spare the personnel. We've got minimum takeoff capability right now. That's why Chaz left us on board.
HUNTER: Why, you chickenshit bastard --
ROBY: Just can that crap! I'm in command here till Chaz returns! And nobody's leaving this ship!
