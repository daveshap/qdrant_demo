Do you ever have a week or two without symptoms and then start to think maybe you're finally getting better, but then you're hit with a day which is worse than you'd remembered?
Literally haven't had a problem with ibs symptoms for way over a week now, I finally thought maybe my body is healing and getting back to normal, and then I get hit with the worst stomach cramps on and off all day, my stomach is just in pieces at the moment and it's getting me so down. It's like doing hurdles. Every time I jump one successfully, I end up tripping over the next 7.
