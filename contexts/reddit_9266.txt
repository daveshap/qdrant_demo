I paid my bills this month. Like, all of them.
I literally just stood up from writing eleven checks to pay utilities, mortgage, AND the medical bills that have been sitting on my counter staring at me with my tax return.   I have just enough left to get through the month (I hope) BUT FUCK IT I DID IT!  I feel like celebrating with you wonderful people.  I dont have big news like im out of debt or i have a great credit score but shit I feel great anyway.  Hang in there fellow strugglers.  And enjoy your victories!

Holy crap platinum!  Ill prepare my speech. This was edit one.
Edit 2: im a girl but I totally answer to bro or dude:)
