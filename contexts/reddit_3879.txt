Dating fuckin sucks
So I’ve been dumped recently by this guy that rocked my world for a month straight. This is the first time I felt this way in a long time. The dates he took me on were magic from nice dinners to dancing under the stars by the lake. Fed me a line that he wouldn’t have unprotected sex until he said he “I love you”, then one night before fully entering me he says I love you and I received him bare. I haven’t done that in forever but he made me so comfortable. Things were great until he decide he couldn’t continue in fears of hurting me which in turns would hurt him. Finally I did an extremely lame attempt to chase after him by showing up at his apartment but he would even out and told to go home. Like literally just stopped everything! I’ve struggled with this for two weeks thinking I did something, which he says I haven’t, but it just doesn’t make sense. I can’t stop think about him though I try. I keep thinking he’ll back come or reach out to me but I doubt he will. Idk just sucks and I’m not sure what I hoped to achieve by posting this but yea.
