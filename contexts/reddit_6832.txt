Been laid off and covid 19 is making it hard to get employed.
I’ve been laid off since June 1. At first I was enjoying the break but now I am worried because i don’t know when I will be employed again. ESPECIALLY Since this pandemic has basically ... ruined the economy. 

I just want to know if anyone feels my pain.... I’m currently dealing with unemployment and now trying to find a job is painful. It seems like there’s less out there I want to apply too....
