CHARLIE: You weren't gonna say goodbye?
MAVERICK: I was, later.
CHARLIE: Long distance? I wouldn't do that to you. I'd at least talk to you.
MAVERICK: I didn't want to see you. I mean, I did...but I didn't..
CHARLIE: I know exactly what you mean.
MAVERICK: How could you?
CHARLIE: I've got a gift just like you do. My gift is I just know what people mean, even if they can't say it. It helps when you're trying to communicate with fighter pilots. Like what you just said was I'm embarrassed
MAVERICK: ...Something like that.
CHARLIE: And I'm gonna sneak off, and be by myself for awhile, like until I can think of a new career...hotel management or something...
MAVERICK: Big talk for someone who's never been shot off her computer.
CHARLIE: Hey, I never said I was a fighter pilot...I never claimed to think it was fun to be shot off the end of a ship in a storm. I can find contentment in a good book. I don't have to roar by someone at Mach two with my hair on fire. Sometimes...I just get happy being with the right man.
MAVERICK: I hope you find him.
CHARLIE: I think I have... I could be wrong. I have been before. Just remember one thing. If you're not Top Gun, if you're not fighting jets, you're not gonna be able to act like a fighter pilot... You're gonna have to act like the rest of us. You're gonna have to master humility. For you guys, that's the toughest maneuver of all.
