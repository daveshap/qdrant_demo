JUNO: Either I just pissed my pants or...
MAC: Or...
JUNO: Thundercats are go!
JUNO: Ow, ow, fuckity-ow. Bren, when do I get that Spinal Tap thing?
BREN: It's called a spinal block, and you can't have it yet, honey. The doctor said you're not dilated enough.
JUNO: You mean I have to wait for it to get even worse? Why can't they just give it to me now?
BREN: Well, honey, doctors are sadists who like to play God and watch lesser people scream.
BREN: Shit. Hey, can we give my kid the damn spinal tap already?
JUNO: It really didn't hurt that bad having him.
