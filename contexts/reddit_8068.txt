"You will not be eligible to apply for financial aid until you are registered for coursework."
Hey all,
I'm like 99% sure I'm going accept my admissions offer to go to grad school at my alma mater, UIUC.

They offered me a tuition waiver, which is amazing. However, I still need to find a way to cover the costs of food/housing. I obviously filed the FAFSA months ago, but I guess they can't tell me what financial aid I'm getting until I enroll for courses (according to their acceptance email)

The only problem is, I can't register for courses until their new student welcome event in June.

How am I supposed to sign a lease for an apartment next year if I don't even know what aid I'm getting? ðŸ˜¢ I'd rather not wait until June to sign a lease, but I also don't think it would be the smartest idea to sign a lease before I find out what my financial aid is. My family's EFC is 0, so I'm dirt poor.

Even if I somehow don't get any need-based financial aid, I would only need about $7000-$10000 to afford the cost of food/housing/textbooks for the one year that I'd be in grad school. I was offered good aid from UIUC (tuition grants) during my undergrad and I only have about $8000 in student loans right now. 

I was offered about $20,000 in loans by another grad school (that I'm not attending), so if I was offered that by another school, do you all think it would be likely that I would be offered a similar amount by UIUC?

Sorry, I know this post was a hot mess, but if anyone can address any of the points I made in the post then that would be greatly appreciated. Also, please don't say "talk to the office of financial aid", because I'll be talking to them this Sunday :) just thinking about this is giving me massive anxiety so it would be helpful if someone could help me with this asap lol
