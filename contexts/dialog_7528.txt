SONNY: Now, you -- what's your name?
MULVANEY: Mulvaney...
SONNY: You and me are checking the other ways in and out.
SONNY: Let's go to the back door. How'd that guy get to be a guard?
MULVANEY: Well, they go to guard school.
SONNY: To what ... learn how to shoot? They don't get a gun.
MULVANEY: They make $105 a week to start. They fold the flag, check the place out in the morning. I don't know what they learn, Sonny.
