What are the pros and cons of Nevada's "Medicaid buy in" Bill?
Nevada recently passed a [bill](https://www.leg.state.nv.us/Session/79th2017/Bills/AB/AB374_R1.pdf) that would allow anyone to buy into Nevada's Medicaid program. The pricing has not yet been set. The Governor must sign the bill and the federal gov't must give permission.

State-based universal healthcare plans in California, New York, [Vermont](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1501050#t=article) and Colorado have been criticized for being overly expensive.

This proposal seems to differ from those in that it's a buy-in, meaning that premiums would cover the costs of expansion. What advantages and disadvantages does that pose?
