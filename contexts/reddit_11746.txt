A scientist dreaming of candy...
I'm a graduate student studying neuroscience right now and I'm not overly thrilled with life. I like my boss and the work is okay, but I just can't see doing it long term. The idea of writing grants makes me want to stab myself repeatedly. Although I like teaching a lot, I received poor (and partially unjustified/untrue) evaluations for my first two semesters. I may not be able to get a teaching job because of those evals.

I've always liked to bake and cook. I'm a better baker than I am a cook, but most of all, I make fantastic candy. I can make your eyes roll back in your head with just one perfect bite and I can make an ancient professor and an young overworked assistant professor go giddy and do a happy dance when I bring in treats. Most of all, I love doing it. I love seeing people get excited over what is decidedly not low-carb or low-fat.

I've always wanted to open a bakery, but it's very consistently been a retirement goal. Tonight, I saw (yet again) an etsy seller selling homemade fudge for 18+ bucks a pound. I currently make 20k a year working 50-60 hours on a good week. Yes, it's for school, but it's still a very rough number. It's been suggested to me before to sell candy on the side, but I know my boss and the department would look down on me for it. Grad students aren't allowed to have other jobs and are usually frowned on for having hobbies. On top of that, my parents who are putting me through grad school, would not approve.

Honestly, reddit, I'm just depressed. I wish to be frolicking in a kitchen with sugar and chocolate. I want to be trying out new candy apple creations and thinking up new fudge confections. Instead, I'm in a lab supervising E. coli while it makes my protein of interest and sitting at a computer exporting files for hours a day. Thanks for listening.
