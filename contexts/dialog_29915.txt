DARRELL: You want somethin'?
JOHN: You Harlin?
DARRELL: Nope. Darrell.
JOHN: Harlin around?
DARRELL: He's up at the Look Out.
JOHN: Will he be back soon?
DARRELL: Doubt it. He's dead. The Look Out's a cemetery.
JOHN: You own this place?
DARRELL: Yep.
JOHN: Then why do you call it Harlin's?
DARRELL: 'Cause Harlin used to own it.
JOHN: But he's dead.
DARRELL: So?
JOHN: You want to take a look at my car? I think the radiator hose is--
DARRELL: Damn. Gonna be another hot one today.
DARRELL: That'll make five in a row. Never seen it so hot. Sometimes I don't even want to get out of bed. I'd rather just lay there and try to catch a breeze. I was in Mexico this one time--
JOHN: Look, pal, I've got places to be. Could you just take a look at my radiator hose. It's busted.
DARRELL: It's your radiator hose. It's busted.
JOHN: I know it's busted. What did I just tell you?
DARRELL: Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?
JOHN: If I could do you think I'd be standing here wasting my time. Can you fix it, or do I have to go somewhere else?
DARRELL: Somewhere else? Mister somewhere else is fifty miles from here. How you planning on getting it there? You gonna push this heap yourself?
JOHN: Okay, I'm stuck. You happy? Now can you fix it, or not?
JOHN: Hey!
DARRELL: Yeah, I can fix it. Gotta run over to the yard and see if I can find a hose like this one, or close enough. Gonna take time.
JOHN: How much time?
DARRELL: Time.
JOHN: What time is it now?
DARRELL: Twenty-after-ten.
JOHN: Jesus. Twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already.
DARRELL: Ninety-two. Only gonna get hotter. I remember one time . . .
