Anyone else distract themselves by going on the internet?
Every time I think about how shit my life is, I canâ€™t help but fall into a wormhole which will probably end up in me cutting myself. The impending anxiety over everything wrong in my life is just too much

Instead I just try to escape everything by going on the internet, watching YouTube, video games, reddit. I just repress everything and try to find immediate satisfaction. Anyone else feel the same?
