On Super Tuesday, no incumbent House congressmen lost their primaries and many seats were uncontested.
On Super Tuesday, in addition to the presidential primaries, [Texas, Arkansas, and Alabama also had primaries for House of Representative seats](http://www.politico.com/tipsheets/morning-score/2016/03/house-incumbents-in-texas-arkansas-alabama-nervously-await-super-tuesday-senate-republicans-fiddle-as-trump-rises-212959) that will be contested in the general election on November 8th, 2016. 

Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on your perspective), no incumbent lost their primary in any of these three states. 47 districts/seats in total were up for grabs.

By my count, no Democratic candidate filed to run in 13 districts, and no Republican filed to run in 4 districts.

In addition, in 21 districts only one Democrat was on the ballot (uncontested), and in 19 districts only one Republican was on the ballot (uncontested). By the other way of looking at it, there were competitive primary races in only 13 Democratic districts (28%), and 24 Republican Districts (51%).

Come November, seven districts will be entirely uncontested because only one candidate will be on the general election ballot (three districts had candidates who waltz into the House with no opposition at any point whatsoever).

**What does this say about the anti-establishment sentiment that is pervasive on the national/presidential election scale? Is the #PoliticalRevolution happening (whether Bernie's or Trump's anti-establishment wave)? Will it ever happen or is it likely to happen?**
