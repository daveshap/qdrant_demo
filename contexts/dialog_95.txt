COLUMBUS: No...
SANCHEZ: No?
COLUMBUS: NO...! I have waited too long, fought too hard. Now you expect me to take all the risks while you take the profit! No... I will not be your servant!
SANCHEZ: I remind you, Senor Colon, that you are in no position to bargain with me.
COLUMBUS: I'm not bargaining!
SANCHEZ: Then you are too ambitious.
COLUMBUS: And were you never ambitious, Excellency? Or is ambition only a virtue among the nobles, a fault for the rest of us?
SANCHEZ: If you won't accept our proposal, we'll simply find someone who will.
