All day vs street parking in Edinburgh and Glasgow We're planning a road trip through England and Scotland next month and we'll have a car rental.While the plan is to focus on the rural parts, we do want to spend a day in Edinburgh and Glasgow. Is daily street parking in those two cities available and safe or will we need to find a parking garage to leave the car all day?
