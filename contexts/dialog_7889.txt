ED: Bela, don't worry. You're better than all this crap.
BELA: I never said I could ad-lib...
ED: Forget about it. We'll make our new movie, and you'll be a star again.
CRISWELL: Mr. <u>Lugosi</u>! It is an unparalleled privilege to meet you. Allow me to introduce myself... I am CRISWELL!
BELA: It's a pleasure...
CRISWELL: Ah, cheer up! Don't lose heart over what happened tonight. I predict that your next project will be an outstanding success!
ED: Wow.
CRISWELL: And who may you be?
ED: Edward Wood, Sir.
CRISWELL: Ah. The director of Glen Or Glenda.""
ED: H-how'd you know?!
CRISWELL: I'm Criswell. I know all.
CRISWELL: Bring me two more Beefeater martinis. Eddie will have another whiskey, Dagmar's a Rum-and-coke, Moustapha and King are chablis -- hey Bela, would you like a wine?
BELA: No. I never drink -- wine.
ED: Hey Cris, how'd you know we'd be living on Mars by 1970? How'd you know it wouldn't be 1975, or even 1980?
CRISWELL: I guessed.
ED: I don't understand.
CRISWELL: I made it up. It's horseshit!
CRISWELL: There's no such thing as a psychic. People believe my folderol because I wear a turban and a black tuxedo.
ED: It's that easy?
CRISWELL: Eddie, we're in show biz! It's all about razzle-dazzle. Appearances. If you dress nice and talk well, people will swallow anything.
