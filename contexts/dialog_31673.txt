PETRA: They left. To a fortress in the mountains.
XANDER: We'll have to go after them.
PETRA: Aren't you afraid?
XANDER: A long time ago I learned how to put fear away in a little place in my head. Maybe that's my problem. If you don't feel fear you can do some amazing things, but you can also screw your life up in ways you can't imagine.
PETRA: I must be healthy, then, because I'm scared to death. I guess I'd better get back to Yorgi.
XANDER: You don't have to do that.
PETRA: Yes, I do. You're right. I can't just let him go free. Besides, I can help you from the inside.
XANDER: Aren't they gonna wonder were you've been?
PETRA: I was supposed to wait for the cop to kill you and then kill the cop. They'll believe me. I've been lying for so long, one more time won't hurt.
XANDER: When this is over, we're just gonna take off, the two of us. Take a vacation.
PETRA: What the hell are we doing? We're doing all this together, trusting each other, making plans, and we haven't even slept together yet.
