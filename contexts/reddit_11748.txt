Going back to college is stressing me out.
I will be a sophomore in college, and I feel much more anxious and worried about going back to school than I did last year. Now I know exactly how hard it is to be away from my best friends, family, and pets, and I am dreading having to leave them after only having a few short months with them. I don't adapt well to change, and for some reason college seems to be a hurdle I simply cannot overcome. Other people act so nonchalant about it, and I wish I could be like them.

I do have friends in college, but we're not as close and I think my sadness at being away from my best friends is causing me to have difficulty making and maintaining new friendships. I worry that my friends and I will grow apart, that we will all meet better friends and go our separate ways, and it's tearing me up inside. 

On top of this, I have strong feelings for a friend, and had many opportunities to express those feelings, but chickened out every time. In two days he will be moving ~1000 miles away to go to college. I know that ship has sailed, but it doesn't stop me from feeling deeply regretful.

I feel so overwhelmed. I wish I could just stop time. When I'm away at school I feel like I'm underwater-apathetically letting myself be carried any which way by the current, experiencing a muted, unhappy life and keeping myself going by thinking ahead to breaks and other times I'll see my friends. It's like I can't be fully happy without them, like I don't want to be.

Edit: forgot to add that my dad is taking my impending going away really hard. I hate seeing him so upset.
