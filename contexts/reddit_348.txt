HELP
okay so maybe like three months ago i left my ex that i've been with for a year and a half because he wasn't mature enough and felt like we weren't on the same page relationship wise. He also had some toxic behaviour. So now, iv'e started to date this other guy who is actually my roomate. Iv'e told him that i wanted to take it easy and wait before i talk about it to my family because i don't want to give the impression to them that im the kind of girl to just jump relationship to relationship naively looking for "true love". Im frustraded because we have a really good chemistry that ive never had with someone before and we genuinely get along so well. ive been living with him for the past 6 months and it feels like we've always been friends. Am i going to fast into another relationship? Am i doing the right thing by taking it slow and hiding him from my family for a while ( just so you know he was completly fine with this and really understands)
