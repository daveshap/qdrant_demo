NEIL: But father, I'm assistant editor.
MR. PERRY: I'm sorry, Neil.
NEIL: But father, it's not fair.
MR. PERRY: Fellows, would you excuse us a minute?
MR. PERRY: I will not be disputed in public, do you understand me?
NEIL: Father, I wasn't disputing you.
MR. PERRY: When you've finished medical school and you're on your own, you can do as you please. Until then, you will listen to me.
NEIL: Yes sir. I'm sorry.
MR. PERRY: You know what this means to your mother, don't you?
NEIL: Yes sir.
NEIL: You know me, always taking on too much.
MR. PERRY: Good boy. Call us if you need anything.
CHARLIE: Why doesn't he let you do what you want?
KNOX: Yeah! Tell him off! It couldn't get any worse.
