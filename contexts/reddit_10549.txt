My dad hanged himself today
I'm in bed now and I just need to write down my thoughts. He was a difficult man, in the sense that his upbringing didn't allow him to believe that he was worthy of love if he wasn't succesful. I just found out that for the past year he'd been covering up the fact that his second company (he lost the first one, worth millions, during the housing crisis) was failing. He'd been getting in with some bad people to stay afloat apparently and he was getting in debt with them too. He just took his life, leaving only a note saying he had a lot of debt and he couldn't deal with it anymore. Not so much as a 'I love all of you'.

My mother is devastated. Me and my sister are just trying to be there for her...

But to be honest. I've also been struggling with depression my entire life. Me and my dad were very much alike and related so much on that level. I thought he was the strongest person I knew. He was literally my hero.

And now I'm just wondering what this all means. How could he have done this? My mom is feeling guilty about being angry but... we are all literally heading for immanent financial ruin. We will lose everything. He was the breadwinner.

I just wish he would have talked to us. I miss him so much already. He was my best friend. Where do I go from here...
