Any job ideas for an easily overwhelmed introvert?
I feel like I have struck out at every job I've ever had. Working as a financial analyst was too overwhelming; the deadlines were too stressful, and being in a bright office full of people drained my energy.

Working in a warehouse was too loud, boring, and didn't pay enough to survive.

Now I'm working in nonprofit admin. I can't deal with spending 8 hours a day in an office full of people, just physically being present at work takes all the energy I have. I continually miss grant application deadlines and take way to long to respond to emails because I am so mentally exhausted that I often can't type cohesive sentences.

I will likely be out of a job soon and I just don't know what to try next. I have not seen any jobs I feel well suited to, and I'm curious if anybody has any recommendations for someone who hates being around other people and falls to pieces when confronted with any stressful situation.

I have two bachelors degrees and did very well in school, however I have performed very poorly in every job I've had so far. I'm not interested in programming as I am not capable of coding proficiently.

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!
