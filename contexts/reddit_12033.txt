Why can't I do it?
She gave me the ultimatum: open relationship or break up. I love her. But for the past 3 years she has been changing from artist to hippy and she needs to "be herself". She doesn't want to break up but she's miserable not being able to have sex with other people.

Why does it bother me so much? Why can't I get over it? I'm an engineer, as logical as they come. But I can't get over this, despite the lack of logical rationale. 

I love every moment we spend together and I don't want to jeopardize that. But why does it make me so bitter? Why do I think things like  "she just can't shut her legs" and terrible slut shaming vocabulary?

Why can't I accept it. Why can't I be who I want to be.
