Just can't make myself care..
I'm sitting here at work.. Once again. Just like every weekday from 8am to 5pm and I simply cannot make myself give half a shit about anything I'm supposed to be doing.

It's not difficult, it's not a lot of work. It's just pointless. I don't give a flying rat's ass if this or that email is up to date in these accounts. Why make us do this manually when a programmer could write something to get it done and keep it up to date continually? This whole department is a half baked pile of shit and I'm definitely over it.

This is probably the umpteenth time I've posted here about my job, I know. But it is always what's bothering me. I may be able to lift myself out of my depression on the weekends but this job just pulls me right back down.

Also, why the fuck does it have to cost so much money just to exist in society? Ridiculous.
