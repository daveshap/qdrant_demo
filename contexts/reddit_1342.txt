I tackled my greatest fear and accepted a job!
I have had 5 jobs in the last 4 years. I quit every single one of them, usually within a week of commencing. The longest I’ve stayed in a job has been 6 weeks. Employment has been my biggest hurdle in my adult life. I become so anxious at work, I start to panic and lose the ability to concentrate. My body goes into fight or flight and I just simply run away and don’t look back. Then the guilt, and depression hits me hard. 

After a good two years of no employment and being on horrible government benefits that constantly threatened to cut and suspended my payments due to not being seen as disabled enough to not work due to my mental health.... I’ve finally had enough. I took my own steps, I went out of my way and I applied for a job in a hospital. 
I got an interview and have been accepted and started just today! 

I have a week of training and then it’s all me looking after a ward. I’ll be doing the afternoon/night shift 3 days a week as an administrator maintaining paper work and discharging/admitting patients. 
My employer is well aware of my hurdles with my mental health and said she is very supportive so fingers crossed I can keep at this and build my confidence up! 
I know i will have my ups and downs, the anxiety will hit me hard some days more than others but I just have to remember how good working is for my mind and how we all start somewhere.

I am proud of myself, It’s so good to be able to say that for the first time in a long time. 

Thank you everyone on this subreddit for being so supportive. 
I hope to read lots of progress stories on here :)
