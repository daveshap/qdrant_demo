Didn't get promoted due to nepotism, or favoritism at work. How should I adress the issue?
I migrated to Canada last year from India. After submitting my resume to about 25 different places, I was finally able to land a job 6 months ago. I work at a Gas station/Travel centre as a cashier. Fast-forwading to last month my supervisor employed a new cashier, and this new employee is her sister. I did'nt have any problem with that, infact I am helping her to learn about the job. However, yesterday I was informed that the new girl would be taking position of the night shift supervisor(I usually work night shift) and she is undergoing training for this. I was in shock as I was the person who deserved this place as, I was the one managing the night shifts and doing most of the work. Please help me how can I address this issue to my manager so that I can be the one to get the promotion?

The manager have no relation with the new girl, but one of the supervisor do
