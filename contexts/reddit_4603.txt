Waking up sad
Updating. Today has not been as horrible. ( I still got nothing accomplished though) It’s night now and I want to share something that I’m currently listen to and it’s soothing. On Pandora, Ragamuffin radio. Found it by accident. It’s all instrumental, mostly acoustic guitar. It’s raining here and it fits together nicely. Hoping I get a good nights sleep. Peace to all. 

I hate waking up like this. Day after day. It’s afternoon and I’m still on the brink of tears constantly. Nothing is really wrong , it’s just that nothing is right. I’m very alone. I have many things to get done, but nothing to look forward to. Another day of bleakness. The sound of my neighbors lawnmower annoys me all to hell. I do t like where I live, I’m too undecided to pack up and move. And just lacking strength.  I’m slightly disabled. 

I make casual searches on places I’d like to go. But I hear it’s bad to make major life decisions when depressed. I could end up in a beautiful new location, but the bleakness inside me is still there. I still don’t connect with other human beings.  Still alone.  Sigh. 

I’m not on any antidepressants. I’ve tried many and none helped. I wish I could just make this feeling go away.
