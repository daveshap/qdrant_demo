I can't enjoy reading anymore.
I used to be really into reading. Mostly books, but also comics and video games that involved a lot of talking/text to read, such as RPGs. But ever since I've been in college, reading has turned into this giant chore. All the reading required for classes, with such boring writing, it just makes me so sick of seeing letters. 

When I'm even in a mood to read, and I open up a book, I think to myself "shouldn't you be reading your school books?" So I feel too guilty to continue. And if I have the freedom to read for leisure, it just feels like work. I want to slam the book shut after a chapter, even when I have nothing else to do.

And with video games, it's worse. I can't stand conversations in games now, so I've limited myself to playing shooters or games that don't require reading. Games where you can just get into action and not worry about the story. 

I'm worried that I won't ever enjoy it again. Like college has irreparably damaged part of me that liked to read.
