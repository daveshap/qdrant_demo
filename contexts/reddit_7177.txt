Learning programming, how can I include this in CV?
Hi there,

I am currently teaching myself Python and I want to be able to put it down on my CV.
I am not currently employed in anything that would have me use Python, but I want to be abls to prove I can compentently use Python.

Is there anything I can do to show employers I can use this new programming language? 

Ideally not paying out for a course or something I would have to pay for.
