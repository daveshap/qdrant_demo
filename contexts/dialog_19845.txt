WELLS: We don't have to do this. I'm a daytrader. I could just go home.
CHIGURH: Why would I let you do that?
WELLS: I know where the money is.
CHIGURH: If you knew, you would have it with you.
WELLS: I need dark. To get it. I know where it is.
CHIGURH: I know something better.
WELLS: What's that.
CHIGURH: I know where it's going to be.
WELLS: And where is that.
CHIGURH: It will be brought to me and placed at my feet.
WELLS: You don't know to a certainty. Twenty minutes it could be here.
CHIGURH: I do know to a certainty. And you know what's going to happen now. You should admit your situation. There would be more dignity in it.
WELLS: You go to hell.
