SHELLY: Yes, Vada I think you're very pretty. You've got these great big sparkling eyes, the cutest little nose, an amazing mouth.
VADA: The boys at school don't think I am.
SHELLY: They'll come around. Close your eyes, I wanna bring out the gorgeous color in them. The first rule in applying eye makeup, is you can never wear enough blue eye shadow.
VADA: Do you like putting makeup on people?
SHELLY: Uh huh, i've been trying to get out to Hollywood for years to do makeup for all the stars, I haven't gotten there yet. All right, open your eyes.
