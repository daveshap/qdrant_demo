JACK: Where? Where?
HECTOR: Thirty meters or so. Moving slow, but straight toward Elsie.
JACK: Can you confirm visually or just radar?
HECTOR: Radar, he's underwater. But he's definitely coming.
JACK: Okay. Lead him in. Okay, everybody up on the trucks. We aim for the stomach or side... there's little chance the darts will pierce his hide. <u>Everybody</u> <u>up</u> <u>on</u> <u>the</u> <u>trucks</u>.
