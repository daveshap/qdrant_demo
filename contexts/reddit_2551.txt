When you're unemployed, what are you supposed to do with all your free time?
When you're unemployed, what are you supposed to do with all your free time?

I just recently became unemployed. I filed for unemployment, so I'm waiting for them to approve or deny my request. But I still just can't shake it.

Prior to that, I had a 40-hour work week. Now that I'm not in that world anymore, am I just supposed to sit in front of a computer, and apply to jobs 24/7. It just seems mundane, and I don't know what to do.

I still have to wait for them to get back to me, but why is finding a job, such a job in of itself. 

I've been applying for the eight last hours, woke up at 5 AM, and I'm feeling super discouraged.

I feel like giving up, I'll never find a new job. What is the point of even trying? 

Why is being unemployed giving me such anxiety and pressure nerves? I don't feel good.
