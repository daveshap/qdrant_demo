PSA: Withdraw your apps
Have you been admitted ED1 or ED2? Do you have no intention to go, even if offered admission? 

PLEASE consider withdrawing your applications now, if so. Yes, we do build the admissions model to take these things into account, but we have students who are literally next on the list to get a “yes” from us if you withdraw now.  And these are also very, very deserving candidates.  First generation, low-income, wonderful musicians, talented humanists, etc, etc, etc.

So please, do your friends and classmates a favor and email the admissions office to withdraw if there’s no way you’re going to that college.  Thank you!
