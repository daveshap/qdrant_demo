Should I rickroll Caltech
they have an essay, â€œCaltech students are known for their humor and pranks, what do you do for fun"

I have already written a proper response, but I am international, and they take only \~30 so unless they blacklist me forever, there is really no downsides to it. (my SAT is 1530, so not too great with scores).

so. ShOuLd I rIcKrOlL CaLtEcH

EDIT: 1530 is good for ivies. But not for caltech. Also for the TGID folks, i am too lazy to make innovative handles. Also, i do have a proper response. Will just add it towards the end haha
