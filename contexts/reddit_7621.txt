Question for Lab Visits as an Undergrad
As an undergraduate in an honours thesis program, I am having some problems with arranging interesting labs for grad studies.

First of all, I really wish to stay in my current lab but want to expand my views on various experimental models and techniques used in other labs. Therefore, I wish to visit other labs.

However, my current honours thesis supervisor appears to question my visits to other places (3 in total) as it seems I do not wish to stay. Thus I have the following questions:

1) Does visiting labs for potential graduate study different than an undergraduate open house?
2) is it a waste of time for the professor to meet with me in this case where I might entirely be entering the lab in the upcoming year but has a general interest in their research?
3) Does the reputation of the school (note not the lab) matter for ones academic journey?

Thank you for answering my question.
