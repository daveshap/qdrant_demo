SERA: Do you want to fuck now?
BEN: Maybe another drink first. More tequila?
SERA: OK... whatever.
SERA: What's the story? Are you too drunk to come?
BEN: I don't care about that. There's time left. You can have more money. You can drink all you want. You can talk or listen. Just stay, that's all I want.
