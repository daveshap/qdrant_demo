I WANT TO GO TO SLEEP AND NEVER WAKE UP. I WANT TO GO TO SLEEP AND NEVER WAKE UP. I WANT TO GO TO SLEEP AND NEVER WAKE UP. I WANT TO GO TO SLEEP AND NEVER WAKE UP. I WANT TO GO TO SLEEP AND NEVER WAKE UP. I WANT TO GO TO SLEEP AND NEVER WAKE UP.
I am useless. Ugly. Lazy. Fat. Stupid. Angry. Guilty. Bitter. Resentful. Jaded. Ignorant. Worthless. An addict. Selfish. Self-righteous. Gluttonous. Hopeless. 

I am dead inside.
