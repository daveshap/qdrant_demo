GALLAGHER: Don't pay attention to him, Stew. He doesn't know what he's talking about.
STEW: Pay attention? I'm not paying any attention to him. You think that guy could get me upset? Hah! Not that mug. He's a tough mug - hard, cynical. He doesn't know the fine things in life - that guy. A bird in a gilded cage, huh? It's getting so a guy can't step out without being called a magnolia. Stew Smith, a magnolia! Not me. Say, I'm not going to hang around and be a speakeasy rat all my life! I'll tell you that. Not me, not me. I'm going to step out and mean something in this world. You watch me. Say, am I a lucky guy to be near Anne Schuyler? I've been hit with a carload of horseshoes, and believe me I know it. Lucky, I'll say I'm lucky! Don't you think I'm lucky, Gallagher?
GALLAGHER: Sure - I think so, Stew.
STEW: I knew you would, pal. A bird in a gilded cage, eh?
GALLAGHER: How is her family going to feel about it?
STEW: Her family? Oh, they'll be all right. I'll bring them around. Gilded cage?! Besides, I'm not marrying her family. Stew Smith in a gilded cage! Stew Smith? Ha! That mug. What does he know?
