BIG CHRIS: Son?
DOG: Made a few quid, did ya? Now where is it?
BIG CHRIS: You all right back there, mate?
DOG: Very fucking funny. Where's what I want?
BIG CHRIS: It's in an office; I have just left it in the office. 137
DOG: Well, you had better go and get it from the office. That's if you want to see your son reach his next birthday. Now chop-fuckin'-chop.
BIG CHRIS: All right, furry muff.
DOG: What are you doing?
BIG CHRIS: Well, it's a five minute walk or a thirty second drive.
DOG: You had better be careful.
SOAP: Well, what's going on?
EDDY: I don't know, but what I do know is that there's no more Harry, which means there's no more debt, and if there's no more debt there's no more problem, and there's no more problem with our neighbours because they are all dead. I think, if I get this right, we haven't done anything wrong anyway, which means we are in the clear.
