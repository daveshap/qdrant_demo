BRODY: How come the sun didn't used to shine in here?
ELLEN: 'cause when we bought the house it was Autumn. This is summer. Feed the dogs.
BRODY: Right.
ELLEN: Do you see the kids?
BRODY: Probably out in the back yard.
ELLEN: In Amity, you say 'Yahd.'
BRODY: The kids are in the yahd, playing near the cah. How's that sound?
ELLEN: Like you're from N'Yawk.
BRODY: Give me 30 years, I'll get it.
BRODY: Did you burn another kettle? Y'know you're a fire hazard? This is the third one!
ELLEN: I never hear the whistle.
BRODY: Feed the dogs.
ELLEN: You want to go through those? I'm taking them to the Thrift Shop. It's Marcia Vaughn's pet charity. Pick out what you want to keep -- it's mostly your city clothes.
BRODY: I used to wear this to the Garden. Garbage strikes. Dog shit. Muggers. Ship it.
ELLEN: Don't be silly -â€“ You're going to make summer better for them...
MICHAEL: Cut my hand. Hit by a vampire.
BRODY: On the swing? I told you not to play near there until I sanded it down. See what your son did?
