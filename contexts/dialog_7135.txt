BOB: Choices???
DAVE: Yes, Bob. Choices... Now the Commerce Department..,
SECRETARY OF COMMERCE: Yes, Mr. President?
DAVE: You're spending forty-three million dollars on an ad campaign to... 'Boost consumer confidence in the American auto industry.'
SECRETARY OF COMMERCE: And it's proving quite effective...
DAVE: Does it make the cars any better?
SECRETARY OF COMMERCE: No, sir. It's more of a perceptual issue.
DAVE: Perceptual?
SECRETARY OF COMMERCE: Yes, it's designed to bolster individual confidence in a previous domestic automotive purchase.
DAVE: Why?
SECRETARY OF COMMERCE: Well... to shore up product identification and preserve market share.
DAVE: So we're spending forty-seven million dollars to make people feel better about a car they've already bought?
SECRETARY OF COMMERCE: Yes, but I wouldn't...
DAVE: Well I'm sure that's really important, but I don't want to tell some eight- year-old kid he has to sleep in the street because we want people to feel better about their cars. Do you want to tell him that?
