Will i ever be enough for someone?
Hello my fellow redditors

I'm new to this sub and I've recently had my heart broken by someone who i thought was the one, but at least she was civil enough to tell me now instead of 3 years down the line.

A bit about me; 

I'm a 23 year old male father of one and  i suffer quite badly with depression and anxiety, prior to these events I've been feeling lost and the occasional thought of suicide or self harm wasn't out of the ordinary, i struggle as it is on a day to day basis I'm currently under the mental health team here in the UK.

I'm reaching out for help from anyone who will listen, this is my last cry for help.
