Become the person you want to date
I realised today that you have to become the person you want to date which usually means you have to upgrade yourself.

You can't date a person of a high standard if you aren't of a high standard yourself.

You can't date an intelligent person if you're not intelligent yourself.

You can't date a smart and fashionable person if you're not smart and fashionable yourself.

You can't date a fit person if you're not fit yourself. 

I stepped back and asked myself whether I would date myself and I straight up said no because I am not stylish, super fun, adventurous or really intelligent; all the qualities I want in a partner. And sadly, I am not attracting that calibre of a partner right now.

However, I have committed myself to improving my style by dressing well and mixing with people of the same calibre in their environments.

I have committed to developing my knowledge and skills though learning languages - currently learning Spanish and have a teacher, structure and infrastructure in place to succeed.

I have committed to exploring the world and having stories to tell about the wonderful people I have met and connected with along my journey.

And none of what I have said is easy but it's definitely worth it in the end.
