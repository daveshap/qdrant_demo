RAMÓN: Where's your mama?
LUIS: She's coming. Charley Vidal gave her a lift.
LUIS: Boy! Did you see the way Mama whopped that deputy with her shoe? Knocked the gun right out ...
RAMÓN: I don't want you hanging around there, hear?
RAMÓN: You all right?
ESPERANZA: Sure.
RAMÓN: Must've been some experience for you, huh?
ESPERANZA: Yes.
RAMÓN: I guess you got enough today to last a lifetime, huh?
ESPERANZA: I'm going back tomorrow.
RAMÓN: You might get hurt. Listen, if you think I'm gonna play nursemaid from now on, you're crazy ... I've had these kids all day!
ESPERANZA: I've had them since the day they were born.
RAMÓN: I'm telling you. I don't stay home with these kids tomorrow.
ESPERANZA: Okay. Then, tomorrow, I take the kids with me to the picket line.
