SHELDRAKE: All right, Gillis. You've got five minutes. What's your story about?
GILLIS: It's about a ball player, a rookie shortstop that's batting 347. The poor kid was once mixed up in a hold- up. But he's trying to go straight -- except there's a bunch of gamblers who won't let him.
SHELDRAKE: So they tell the kid to throw the World Series, or else, huh?
GILLIS: More or less. Only for the end I've got a gimmick that's real good.
SHELDRAKE: Got a title?
GILLIS: Bases Loaded. There's a 4O-page outline.
SHELDRAKE: Get the Readers' Department and see what they have on Bases Loaded.
