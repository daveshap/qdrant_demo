LYNN: It was Grandma's. It's not for playing. What if it broke? You know how sad I'd be.
COLE: You'd cry. Cause you miss grandma so much.
LYNN: That's right. So why do you take it, sweetheart?
COLE: Sometimes people think they lose things and they didn't really lose them. It just gets moved.
LYNN: Did you move the bumble bee pendant?
LYNN: You didn't take it before. You didn't take it the time after that. And now, you didn't take it again?
COLE: Don't get mad.
LYNN: So who moved it?
LYNN: There's only two of us. Maybe someone came in our house -- took the bumble bee pendant out of my closet, and then laid it nicely in your drawer? Is that what happened?
COLE: Maybe.
