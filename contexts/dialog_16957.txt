MANZANO: Pollo Pibil. Chicken and chorizo sausage. Hmmmh. They marinate it in lemon and orange juice. It's a stew really.
RAYBURN: I already ate.
MANZANO: Tell me about your friend Creasy.
RAYBURN: You just said it. He's my friend. Nothing else to say.
MANZANO: I read the file. You and Creasy have been seen quite a bit together.
RAYBURN: Two tourists who never went home.
MANZANO: You helped him get this job.
RAYBURN: That's what friends do.
MANZANO: Yes. But if I traced Creasy to you, others will do it as well. Their facilities are as good as my own, if not better.
RAYBURN: I can take care of myself.
MANZANO: You and Creasy both. A two man army according to Interpol. Panama. Lebanon with the Druze. Desert Storm. Where you were contracted by the U.S. Army to hunt down elite Iraqi military commanders. You two were a married couple.
RAYBURN: The kind that gets divorced, but still stay friends.
MANZANO: What happened to him? What happened to Creasy?
RAYBURN: None of your business. Or mine for that matter. I got nothing more to say.
MANZANO: This is my jurisdiction. I want these men as much as Creasy does.
RAYBURN: He'll deliver more justice in a weekend, than ten years of your courts and tribunals. So stay out of his way.
MANZANO: I plan to. I'll even help him if I can. He's going to lead me to the 'The Dreamer'. Someone I want very badly. But I'd like to understand him. Give me that.
RAYBURN: Pinta Martin Ramos is just a number to you. Tragic, a public outcry, but a number. One more dead.
MANZANO: What was she to Creasy then?
RAYBURN: Light. At the end of a long, dark tunnel. Somehow, she showed him it was alright to live again.
MANZANO: And they took that away.
RAYBURN: A man can be an artist in anything. Stone, paint, words. Food. Anything if his soul is true to it. Creasy's art is death. And he's about to paint his masterpiece.
