On the Use of \"nothing\" the statement 'nothing can be known' seems straightforward, right? 'nothing' is the subject, in which case the statement can be taken to mean that not a single thing can be known.  and yet, is there a way of taking the 'nothing' as adverbial, to qualify the ability to know, such that the statement negatively qualifies the ability to know?
