Do you ever want to just not exist?
 Not kill yourself, but not ever exist ever again.

I have 0 friends. My family just doesn’t quite understand, and I’m too different to even want to explain it to them. My dad is financially depressed and doesn’t see the point in proceeding, and I’m feeling the same feeling he is. I just want someone to talk to who isn’t a therapist for once. I wish I wasn’t so alone all the time.
