Is anyone else having major depressive feelings & anxiety about all that’s going on right now?
My routine is completely fucked. No school, no work, no friends, no gym. I’m terrified for the next couple of weeks because I don’t want to (and quite frankly, can’t) live like this. Is anyone else having these same fears/anxieties?
