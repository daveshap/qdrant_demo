DULANEY: Miss Sellers, do you know Dr. Alan Paley?
MISS SELLERS: Yes.
DULANEY: Where did you meet him?
MISS SELLERS: I'm a nurse. I used to work at Roseburg Memorial Hospital. Dr. Paley's on staff there.
DULANEY: What was the nature of your relationship with Dr. Paley.
MISS SELLERS: We dated for about a month last year.
DULANEY: Then what happened?
MISS SELLERS: I realized he wasn't serious. He was seeing other women -- asking other nurses at the hospital out, so I ended it.
DULANEY: -- And what did Dr. Paley do after you stopped seeing him?
MISS SELLERS: He used to call me -- tell me that I couldn't just walk out on him. He said that if I didn't come back he'd make my life miserable.
DULANEY: Did he make your life miserable?
MISS SELLERS: Yes -- he did.
DULANEY: How?
CARDENAS: Objection! May I remind Mr. Dulaney that the person on trial here is Miss Lawson -- not Dr. Paley.
DULANEY: Your Honor, I'm trying to establish a pattern in Dr. Paley's behavior with women.
