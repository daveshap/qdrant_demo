what purpose does the world have for an ugly, awkward girl?
Have finally learned my place in life during these times of self-isolation. No one cares what you're doing. No one cares if you're okay. No one cares about whether you are dead or alive. Stay in your lane, you will never be good enough for anyone else. Shut up and just keep to yourself. I can't take this anymore.
