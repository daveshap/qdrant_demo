JENNIFER: My name is Jennifer Hillman. I was at the police station earlier today--
MCCLEOD: I remember you.
JENNIFER: I was wondering if I could talk to you?
MCCLEOD: Are you a cop?
JENNIFER: No. I'm an archaeologist.
MCCLEOD: What do you want?
JENNIFER: To talk to you.
MCCLEOD: I don't think we have anything to talk about, Miss Hillman.
