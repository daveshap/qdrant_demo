Draw a mask on a TIFF file I have a raster (TIFF file) and I would like to draw a mask on it.So, I basically create a shapefile and draw polygons on the area I wanted to mask.Then, I would like to rasterize this shapefile by creating a raster with the same extent than the raster file. This new raster must have only 0 and 1 values (1 for accepting value, 0 for not accepting).The problem is that with the common Vector to Raster on the default plugin of QGIS, if I select the raster to get the extent (on the options), it's creating a TIFF with the initial raster value and change only the value on the polygon.I can't draw these kind of mask on PhotoShop because the TIFF is on int16 and so, if I open it on PhotoShop I have a black image.At this stage, the image isn't referenced. I just want to overlay a mask of 0-1 value upside the initial raster.Is there a simple way to do tha? I can't find anything on the web... Plugin \"Mask\" don't do what I want.
