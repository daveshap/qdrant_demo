My best friend from back in highschool is moving tomorrow to university in another city.
It just feels really sad. Im gonna miss him alot. I dont deal with negative emotions very well and have trouble articulating them. Hes been around through my darkest days. When I got cheated on, when people I loved died, when I lost my job girlfriend and home in the same week. he was always there for me. He always let me sleepnover if i didnt have anywhere to spend the night and took care of me like his own brother. I just dont know how to feel now that hes leaving. I only have two other friends besides him and one of them is moving to california pretty soon. One by one im being left very alone and its just getting to me.
