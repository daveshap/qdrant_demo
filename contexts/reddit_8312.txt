Do Putin's communications generally push a legitimate alternative worldview or is he often simply dishonest?
I was curious what amount of credibility statements by Putin's administration have.  Has he been caught repeatedly lying brazenly?  If so what are the clearest examples? Does he appear to have regard for the truth, or is he instead simply using a state propoganda machine to "muddy the water", making it difficult to disprove falsehoods?  Or is he promoting a largely consistent worldview based on reality and facts?

I've seen a lot of skepticism about his [claims](http://www.businessinsider.com/putin-read-my-lips-no-russia-hack-us-election-trump-2017-3-2) on things like the role of Russia in our elections, as well as their stated [objectives in Syria](http://time.com/4054941/putin-russia-syria/).  Should he be trusted less than any other politician?
