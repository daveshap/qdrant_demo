How important is the recently banned North Korean coal exports to China in the North Korean economy?
China has announced it is banning all coal imports from North Korea.

The article claims that between 30%-40% of all of North Korea's exports are coal and a majority of that goes to China. How important is coal in the North Korean economy? Do they have other major exports that they can fill this gap with?


Thanks in advance for any answers!
