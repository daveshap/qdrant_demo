Every time someone is aggresssive with me it entirely ruins my day
For instance, last night with friends I made the mistake of laughing at something someone said that wasn't supposed to be funny (that was truly my fault, laughing at this was disrespectful from me, I only realized it later), and the person talking replied quite angrily to me something like "get out if you don't want to listen".

And I'm still anxious about it, it's still stuck in my brain and ruining my day. The problem is that it happens even when I haven't done anything wrong and someone is just being completely mean to me.

I just can't get past it before a long time and it's annoying to not to be able to think properly because of that. I used to suffer from severe social anxiety in the past (that 'solved itself' progressively when I was a teenager) but that problem I described never disappeared, and I have no idea how to solve it.
Thanks for reading !

edit : I definitely need to check the titles for mistakes too
