Wonder Boy: The Dragon's Trap PS4 Hard Mode Trophy? What is actually required to clear Hard Mode for the trophy? I have beaten all the bosses including the final one.I didn't get the stones so is that required? I already did a playthrough on normal and got all the stones there and bought all the weapons. I don't feel like doing that again for Hard but no matter how many times I beat the final boss and watch the credits the trophy just doesn't pop.
