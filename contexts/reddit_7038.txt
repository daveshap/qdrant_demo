Is it possible to start a job with 80k?
My best friend who lives in Tampa said once she is done with nursing program she hope to start 60k+

Then she said that her bf can start with 80k in Atlanta because he is doing cyber security and have certification 

Like I don’t doubt they will eventually make this much but I don’t think you can start a job after school with that amount of money
