Does anyone think that networking has not been helpful to you at all?
I am an introvert but I still network occasionally. I have some very niche hardskill and work in a super niche industry. I hate meeting people but I still make friends and go out to network. That say, I never think that networking has been pretty useful and it has never landed me a job. On top of that, I think the idea of networking is pretty disgusting as you can assume or feel most are networking to their own monetary benefit.

Either it is niche or it is 'still some endless entry job' dont really matter, nobody really look up at me, and somehow I am coming to the conclusion that networking is likely doing nothing to my 'career', if such career concept still matters.

I am growingly introvert as I become older, and most of the time I just want to be alone, despite I am talkative and very knowledgeable given the topic.
