KATHY: Can you go fifteen minutes without thinking about it?
PETER: No. But I'm open to distractions.
KATHY: I'm sure you are.
PETER: You know, you're not the easiest person in the world to get close to.
KATHY: You always want to talk about me. What about you?
PETER: Wasn't I just talking about me?
KATHY: No. You were talking about chess.
PETER: Alright. What about me?
KATHY: I dunno. Where's Erica mother?
PETER: She died in a car accident.
KATHY: I'm sorry.
PETER: It's alright. It was a long time ago.
KATHY: It must've been very hard on Erica?
PETER: It was.
KATHY: And you?
