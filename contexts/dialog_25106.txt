SEFTON: Here's the knife to do it with. Only make sure you got the right throat.
DUKE: We're looking at it.
HOFFY: Hurry up on that trap. What are you trying to do, Sefton? Gum up the works?
SEFTON: That's right. Or would you rather see Dunbar lying out there in the mud tomorrow morning like Manfredi and Johnson?
HOFFY: Look, Sefton, I had my hands full so they wouldn't tear you apart --
SEFTON: I called it the last time, didn't I?
PRICE: Are we going to stand around here and listen to him until the Germans find out where Dunbar is?
SEFTON: The Germans know where Dunbar is.
HOFFY: How do they know?
SEFTON: You told them, Hoffy.
HOFFY: Who did?
SEFTON: You did!
HOFFY: You off your rocker?
SEFTON: Uh-huh. Fell right on my head. Sprechen sie deutsch?
PRICE: No. I don't sprechen sie deutsch.
SEFTON: Maybe just one word? Kaput? Because you're kaput, Price.
PRICE: Will you get this guy out of my hair so I can go?
SEFTON: Go where? To the Kommandant's office and tell him where Dunbar is?
PRICE: I'll kill you for that!
SEFTON: Shut up! Security Officer, eh? Screening everybody, only who screened you? Great American hero. From Cleveland, Ohio! Enlisted right after Pearl Harbor! When was Pearl Harbor, Price? Or, don't you know?
PRICE: December seventh, forty-one.
SEFTON: What time?
PRICE: Six o'clock. I was having dinner.
SEFTON: Six o'clock in Berlin. They were having lunch in Cleveland. Am I boring you, boys?
HOFFY: Go on.
SEFTON: He's a Nazi, Price is. For all I know, his name is Preismaier or Preissinger. Sure, he lived in Cleveland, but when the war broke out he came back to the Fatherland like a good little Bundist. He spoke our lingo so they put him through spy school, gave him phony dogtags --
