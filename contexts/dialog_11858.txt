LOOMIS: Sheriff? I'm Doctor Sam Loomis.
BRACKETT: Lee Brackett.
LOOMIS: I'd like to talk to you, if I could.
BRACKETT: May be a few minutes. I gotta stick around here...
LOOMIS: It's important.
BRACKETT: Ten minutes.
LOOMIS: I'll be here.
LOOMIS: Anybody live here?
BRACKETT: Not since 1963, since it happened. Every kid in Haddonfield thinks this place is haunted.
LOOMIS: They may be right.
