PERRY: If one of you can get that -- I mean, I want the real Superman. Who is he? Where's he from? What's his favorite ball team? What's up?
LOIS: He is. Usually.
PERRY: Whoever comes up with that will make Woodward and Bernstein look like Abbot and Costello.
LOIS: Oh, what a chance! If I could just -- get to him.
CLARK: You're not the only one.
LOIS: Yes, but I'm the only one who knows him. I -- I really like the guy. And he likes me. I think. I mean, I could talk to him, you know? And he could talk to me. Anytime...
LOIS: With my luck, now it'll rain.
SUPERMAN: Not a chance. It's too nice a night.
LOIS: Superman???
SUPERMAN: Right on the first guess.
LOIS: Wha'...what are you doing here?
SUPERMAN: I came to talk to you.
LOIS: The answer is yes. Now what's the question?
SUPERMAN: There's been a lot of confusion in the media about who I am and what I'm up to and all that. I'd like to set the record straight. With your help.
LOIS: This is incredible. I was just sitting here trying to figure out how to contact you. I mean, you don't have an answering service, right?
SUPERMAN: Unlisted number, Shall we proceed?
