Legally Blonde
At least one upvote and I'll make my Brown video portfolio a recreation of the video Elle Woods submitted to Harvard in Legally Blonde.

Edit: Wow! Got the upvote! Guess I'm doing it

Edit 2: so I meant this as a joke but now I think I'm actually gonna film it and post it within the next 2 weeks... if anyone has suggestions on how to do this pls let me know
