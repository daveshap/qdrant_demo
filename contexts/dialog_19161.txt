MOVIE MALLORY: I can't go. I'm too fucked up.
MOVIE MICKEY: I'm not saying it's not gonna hurt, but--
MOVIE MALLORY: I can't run with you, Mickey! I really want to. If I could, I would, but I can't. I gotta stay here. But you can still get out of here.
MOVIE MICKEY: No fuckin' way! No fuckin' way!
MOVIE MALLORY: If they stay, they'll catch you, and they don't have to catch you---
MOVIE MICKEY: No fuckin' way!
MOVIE MALLORY: Mickey, you're wasting time!
MOVIE MICKEY: I don't give a damn if a million United States marines, all whistling the halls of Montezuma, are gonna come marchin' down this alley any second. There ain't not fuckin' way in hell I'm leaving you. And that's that!
