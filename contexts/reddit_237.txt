I don’t know if I should transfer schools
My school is... really... bad. They have told me multiple times they can’t support my mental health issues and the vice principal goes as far as to try to deny me of my accommodations. I was given the option to transfer to another school, with a program that would be good for me. They would be able to support me. But, there’s one issue. I would have to leave my friends that I have been with since elementary school. I broke the news that it might be happening to them last night, and they all seemed so sad. I felt so bad that I told them I’d make sure that I wouldn’t be transferred. I would still live in the same area, just not go to school with them anymore. I have friends at my new school, but I don’t know what to do. Ultimately, the decision is mine to make and it’s so much pressure. I want to stay with my friends, but maybe this new school could help me? And what if the new school doesn’t help? I’m just all alone without my best friends since elementary school?
