Help deciphering abbreviated terms in technical manual I'm having trouble deciphering some abbreviations in a parts list of capacitors from a technical manual for an old (80s-90s) computer.  I've managed to work out that \"CPCTR\" stands for \"Capacitor\however I'm not sure about the abbreviations after that.  I guess they describe the type of capacitor? Here's the different types listed:CPCTR CPLTCPCTR CER (\"Ceramic\" maybe?)CPCTR TANTCPCTR DCPLR (\"DC Polarized\" maybe?)CPCTR ALECThe one I really need to translate is CPCTR DCPLR.  The others are provided mainly for context.  Google has been no help I'm afraid.
