I tried to hang myself and I’m not handling it well
Yesterday I tried to hang myself from a bridge with a belt and when I jumped I instantly regretted it. I fought with all my strength to hold on to the rail, but the belt was chocking me. I tried screaming for help but my voice was too hoarse for anyone to hear me. Eventually my arms gave out and I started to dangle and suffocate. I saw people in my life that had died and I saw all the great memories of my life flash before my eyes. Right as I was about to “go out” my leg began to swing up and reached a ledge. It was my last strength. I pulled myself up with my remaining core strength and leg strength so that I was parallel with the bridge. This gave me room to breath again. I swung my arm up and around the rail so that I could attempt to take the belt off and I knew I only had one shot at this. I was successful, but my body gave out after the belt was free and I dropped into the water. The next day (or today) I have been reliving the moments that seemed to be my final moments and other PTSD symptoms and I’m not sure how I can deal with it. Anyone have anything that could help?
