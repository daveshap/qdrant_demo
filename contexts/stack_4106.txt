Can I use an Oyster card to travel to Welwyn Garden City? I\u2019ll be taking the Great Northern train from London\u2019s King\u2019s Cross station to Welwyn Garden City. Can I use an Oyster card for this? Is there a weekly pass that I can use? I\u2019ll be traveling this route all weekdays for 2 weeks.
