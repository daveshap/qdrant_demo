Cliff's Delta in R? I've been playing around in R quite a bit and am looking for a way to compute Cliff's Delta on a set of items from a personality questionnaire between two groups of students (control and experimental)I'm wondering what I would need to do to set up the data. For instance, would it be just a matter of having a set of questions across columns for each group (e.g., Q1_control, Q1_experiment, and so on), and having the id's in the first row, or is it slightly more involved?Any guidance would be greatly appreciated!D.
