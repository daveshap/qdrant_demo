JACK: I'm sorry...
KATE: Don’t worry about it, Jack...
JACK: What’s going on?
KATE: I’m moving to Paris...it was right here... It’s a box marked “Jack.” I put it in the stack for the Salvation Army...
JACK: Paris?
LORI: Do you want me to look for the box or call the airline?
KATE: Hey, kind of under a little pressure here.
LORI: Hey, kind of giving up Christmas day for my ex-boss here.
KATE: You didn’t seem to mind offering to help me on Christmas day when you were unwrapping that Prada bag I gave you.
LORI: Maybe it’s by the wardrobe boxes...
JACK: You’re moving...
KATE: Uh huh. To Paris. My firm has an office there and I’m going to be heading it up.
JACK: To Paris. Paris, France.
KATE: That’s the one...
JACK: So you’re not at a non- profit firm?
KATE: Not with what they pay me...
JACK: You’re not married, are you?
KATE: No, Jack, I never got married. You?
JACK: Not exactly... Can we just take a minute here? Maybe get a cup of coffee or something...?
LORI: I’ll go for a cup of coffee!
KATE: Yes!
KATE: I found it!
LORI: Congratulations. The La Guardia flight’s canceled but I got you out of Kennedy on United at nine. Am I good or what?
