Entitled aunt could have potentially given my grandfather COVID-19
I’m making a second post about the same person. The link to the first post is right below.

Last Monday, I woke up and had a pretty bad mood already, from the fact I had to do homeschool that day and I had quite the headache. My grandparents live across the street. I go look out the window to see my aunt’s massive Toyota van there. I was rather disgruntled, because my aunt is incredibly entitled. She hasn’t been following any of the measures meant to slow the spread of coronavirus. She hasn’t been wearing a mask in public, and she didn’t self-quarantine for the mandatory 14 days, and she both came from and showed in up hot spot states (Massachusetts and New York, respectively). Her local Walmart had 41 employees test positive for COVID-19, and she definitely didn’t wear a mask. This would’ve been just a coincidence, albeit a rather bad one, if not for the events I’m about to mention. My grandparents both came home from the hospital last weekend (grandfather for a urinary tract infection, and grandmother for rather extreme constipation). On Friday morning, an ambulance showed up over there. My mom went over there and found out why the ambulance was over there and also my entitled aunt mentioned that she had noticed a cough. As of right now, we aren’t sure if he has COVID, because he often coughs while eating and other times to clear his throat. And did I mention that he is a VERY high risk person, as he is going to be 87 in June, and relies on others for his most basic needs.  
Tl;dr: Entitled aunt may have given my grandfather coronavirus.
