FRANCESCA: I don't know. Please...
ROBERT: I'm going to be here a few more days. I'll be at the Inn. We have some time. Let's not say any more now.
FRANCESCA: No. Don't do this.
ROBERT: I CAN'T SAY GOODBYE YET! We'll leave it for now. We're not saying goodbye. We're not making any decision. Maybe you'll change your mind. Maybe we'll accidentally run into each other and ... and you'll change your mind.
FRANCESCA: Robert, if that happens, you'll have to decide. I won't be able to.
