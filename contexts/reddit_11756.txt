im just really sad
i’m currently really busy with working towards uni and my exams are in may. everyone says that this time is absolutely crucial to doing well but nowadays i just find that i can’t be bothered. 

it’s not that i don’t want to do well, ive got a place i really want to go to, but i just don’t think i can do it anymore. it’s just a little bit out of reach i think, and at this rate if i don’t pick up the pace i really don’t think i’ll get there. 

which is another layer of stress altogether; the voice in my head is telling me to pull it together but even i know that’s not possible. i feel really lonely, don’t think anyone else should resort themselves to spending time with me, i’m boring and stupid, etc etc 

i want to make more friends but i can’t seem to apply myself into my own life. does that make sense???? i don’t even know
