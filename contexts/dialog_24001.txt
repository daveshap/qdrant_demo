VIKTOR: The premiere was the first time I've convinced her to venture out and it just confirmed her worst nightmares.
ELAINE: Viktor, you should have said something.
VIKTOR: She doesn't want pity.
ELAINE: You're so good to protect her like this.
VIKTOR: I'll tell you what. I know how much this means to you. I'll try to get her to plug the film. I'm not promising anything but maybe she'll do a talk show -- taped.
ELAINE: Oh, make it live -- please, Viktor.
VIKTOR: I'll try. Maybe live but remote. She'll never go to them.
