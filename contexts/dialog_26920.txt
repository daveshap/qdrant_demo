SARAH: What's that?
REESE: Nitroglycerin, basically. Bit more stable. I learned howto make it when I was a kid.
REESE: Make sure there's none on the threads, like this. Now screw the end-cap on...very gently.
SARAH: You must have had a fun child-
REESE: That's good. Now, seven more like that while I make fuses.
SARAH: I was thinking, there's so much I've got to show you when we get through this. It's mind boggling, the pos- sibilities...Disneyland, the beach, movies...matinees with popcorn and foot-long hot dogs...
REESE: Hot dogs?
SARAH: I want to buy you a hot dog so bad,Kyle...all the things you've never seen and done. You're here, but wherever you go, and whatever you touch, you bring the war with you.
REESE: My whole life has been combat.
SARAH: I want it to be over for you.
REESE: Not possible.
SARAH: I want it to be over for me too. I feel like I slipped over some invisible line, that I'm in your world now. Everything's the same, but I see it differently. It's like, there's you and me, and him...but nobody else can understand or help or even touch us.
