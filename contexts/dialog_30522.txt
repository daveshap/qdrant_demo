DEANE: Barnes, where the hell have you been?!
PARKER: Trying to find out where the bomb is. Where the hell have you been?
DEANE: What did you find out?
PARKER: Call off the manhunt looking for me. I didn't kill the transport guards.
DEANE: It's already been called off. Witnesses confirmed you weren't the shooter. Did you find out where the bomb is?
PARKER: No, but I've confirmed the reelection rally is the target. How much C-4 is missing?
DEANE: Enough to level an entire city block.
PARKER: If I were you, I'd get every demolition team in the city searching in and around the Biltmore Hotel.
DEANE: Demolition teams have searched everywhere in and around the hotel. I don't know where...
PARKER: Sid is smart enough to know you'd check everywhere in the immediate area. Whatever the device is, he's probably got it timed to move into position just before it detonates. Have the demo teams check every subway tunnel, water pipe, gas pipe, and sewer pipe that goes under, over, or into the arena.
DEANE: You know how much man power you're talking about?
PARKER: You're the highest law enforcement official in the country. Use the fucking army if you need to.
DEANE: This better not be a wild goose chase.
PARKER: Or what, you'll authorize my death a second time today?
DEANE: Don't forget, convict, if this psycho isn't stopped, you go right back to rotting in a prison cell.
