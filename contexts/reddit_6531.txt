Managers or recruiters, why do you question someone’s “loyalty to the company” or bring up the “experience” card when they ask about pay?
I hear this all the time. Someone says hey I’m asking this much. Then the recruiter says “oh well I mean we can’t pay you this much but you’ll get experience or exposure”. I also hear about how when someone talks about their pay, their managers question whether that employee really care about the company or the loyalty.

Don’t get me wrong, exposure is definitely important for entry level positions. For fresh out of college especially. Maybe they DO need to take a lower paying job to get experience.

But for associate, mid level and higher, like why?

What do you think people come to work for? MAJORITY of the people don’t actually “care about the company”. They come to the work place for one reason and one reason only. To get paid. To make a living. That’s it. This isn’t some saving the whales or rain forest or Africa humanitarian job. People come to work and grind away for that $$$.

And for recruiters that use that “experience card”, experience doesn’t pay bills.

So why do you always ask these questions to try and guilt trip your employees or candidates?
