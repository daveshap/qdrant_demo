TUCKER: I think you'd better sit down.
MARY: Tucker, I appreciate you doing all this, but I'm really strapped for time here and --
TUCKER: Mary, the man's a killer.
MARY: What...?
TUCKER: I've got a friend in the Boston police department. He faxed me this this morning. I'll just give you the highlights. After a short stint as a petty thief, Patrick R. Healy graduated to armed robbery by the age of fourteen. At sixteen he committed his first murder -- a pretty teacher's aid named Molly Pettygrove. He was incarcerated until age twenty-two when, despite a grim psychological profile, the state was forced to release him. In his mid- twenties and again in his early thirties he was suspected of homicides in the states of Utah and Washington. Unfortunately, the bodies were so badly decomposed that there wasn't enough evidence to hold him, and on and on and so forth and so on.
MARY: Holy shit...
MAGDA: Puffy, get over here.
MARY: Magda!
MAGDA: The little shit lied to me about that guy!
MARY: I can't believe this is happening. I'm supposed to be meeting him in an hour.
TUCKER: Okay, just calm down. It's going to be okay.
