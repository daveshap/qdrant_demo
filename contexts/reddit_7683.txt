Citation and Common Knowledge Advice
Hello World!

I am working on a cumulative/ e-portfolio project and I am wanting to include some “research” or “detailed notes” excerpts from my archive into a section displaying some of my previous projects. 

The majority of what I want to display doesn’t include traditional references but are from a professional online “course/training” from work as an intern.  

Though they are notes, they are delivered in a way that is highly detailed and formatted including diagrams and drawings that differ slightly from the original source, but the information is the same. 

TLDR: 

What I am stumped on is that in the field this would be common knowledge and I don’t want to professionally put out work that isn’t “mine”. However, the information obtained from the source is very concise, and I don’t want to muddle the work to claim it as my own. 


Question: How do I go about this?
