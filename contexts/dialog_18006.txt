PAUL: An old friend. I was rummaging through a closet and it was just sitting there. Like it was waiting for me.
SINDELL: It's... it's nice, Paul. It's got... character.
PAUL: When I wrote my first book, I used to carry it around in this while I was looking for a publisher. That was a good book, Marcia. I was a writer then.
SINDELL: You're still a writer.
PAUL: I haven't been a writer since I got into the Misery business--
SINDELL: Not a bad business. This thing would still be growing, too. The first printing order on Misery's Child was the most ever--over a million.
PAUL: Marcia, please.
SINDELL: No, no. Misery Chastain put braces on your daughter's teeth and is putting her through college, bought you two houses and floor seats to the Knick games and what thanks does she get? You go and kill her.
PAUL: Marcia, you know I started Misery" on a lark. Do I look like a guy who writes romance novels? Do I sound like Danielle Steel? It was a one- time shot and we got lucky. I never meant it to become my life. And if I hadn't gotten rid of her now
SINDELL: I'm glad to hear that, Paul, I really am. But you have to know--when your fans find out that you killed off their favorite heroine, they're not going to say, Ooh
PAUL: Marcia, why are you doing this to me? Don't you know I'm scared enough? Don't you think I remember how nobody gave a shit about my first books? You think I'm dying to go back to shouting in the wilderness? I'm doing this because I have to. Now, I'm leaving for Colorado to try to finish this and I want your good thoughts--because if I can make it work ... I might just have something that I want on my tombstone.
