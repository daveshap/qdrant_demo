TRAFFIC WARDEN: You got a ticket already and, if you don't move it now, sir, we will move it for you.
PAUL: I'll only be a minute.
TRAFFIC WARDEN: You've already been fifteen.
PAUL: Look. Go on, look.
TRAFFIC WARDEN: At what, exactly?
PAUL: My van is half full.
TRAFFIC WARDEN: So?
PAUL: So I've just got to put you in, and I am off.
PLANK: My neck, Dog. That's the last bag?
DOG: How about you? All right?
