I bought a MacBook! And got a scholarship from work!
It was 300 (used) from the Facebook marketplace, but I really needed a new laptop for college next semester and since I was going to community college my job at KFC covered 2000 from the 3500 cost AND I got a state scholarship of 850!! I’m so happy I’ve never owned a laptop so nice and you can’t even tell it’s used, I prayed for this scholarship I’m so happy I got it 😁
