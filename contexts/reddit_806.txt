Girlfriend Trouble (Real Advice pls)
So I have a gf that I just got and broke up with.  She said she’s taking a break from dating and that she’s not good at it and says sorry to me.  I do t know what to do and school is tomorrow. One of my friends knows we like each other but doesn’t know we got together and broke up over the weekend. What do we do when she starts badgering and won’t listen. (Me and gf are still friends.) also do you think it’s a break from dating me or from dating in  general and might get back together with me. Please respond soon I need help.
