GEORGE: Immortality.
SKIPPER: Spirits have a way of bringing that out.
GEORGE: And being sixteen.
SKIPPER: They're in a hurry to grow up. They don't know about consequences or responsibility. That's being sixteen too. I promise you one thing...
GEORGE: What's that?
SKIPPER: They'll know about it in the morning.
