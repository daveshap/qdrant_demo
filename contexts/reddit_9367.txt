Something no one has mentioned...Covid-19, the poors, and social distancing.
 

Stay  at home, but the working class can't afford to miss work. Few have  emergency funds, even some of the more higher earners have no savings.

A  lot of jobs are offering to let you stay home, totally unpaid of  course. You might get unemployment, but that's only a fraction of your  regular pay.

Buy 2-3 weeks worth of groceries, again, some people can't afford to do so.

Some people downright refuse to get tested or get hospitalized for it because they can't afford to.

Covid-19  has struck some countries with very good "safety nets" and wreaked  havoc. It's very scary that a lot of damage in being done in the USA due  to income inequality.
