Why is correlation not used while splitting in Decision Trees? Say we have data where we have temperature, humidity, wind and rain for deciding whether we go and play tennis or not.While selecting best feature to split upon initially, we use ID3 or Gini index. My question is why not use correlation ie when the features have maximum correlation with the output, split on that feature.It seems obvious, but I can't find spit using correlation anywhere.
