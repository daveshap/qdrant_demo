WINNER: Uh, I have a plane to catch to Cleveland... Can I get my winnings?
SIGNALER: Look what they did to my hand, man!
ACE: All right, I'm gonna give you a choice. You can either have the money and the hammer or you can walk out of here. You can't have both. What do you want?
WINNER: I just wanna get out of here.
ACE: And don't forget to tell your friends what happens if they fuck around in here. You understand?
WINNER: I'm sorry. I made a bad mistake.
ACE: You're fuckin' right, you made a bad mistake. 'Cause if you come back here - we catch either one of you - we're gonna break your fuckin' heads and you won't walk out of here. You see that fuckin' saw? We're gonna use it. You don't fuck around in this place. You got it?
WINNER: Yeah.
ACE: Get out of here.
WINNER: Thank you.
