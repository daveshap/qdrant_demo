Stimulus success! What I did with my $1200 check. How are you spending yours? Having a spreadsheet of all of my expenses made these choices a no brainer. Planning ahead will save you money!
As someone with a disability, my income is very low. I have bills that often exceed my income. The stimulus relief has actually been a relief for me. After years of impulse spending, no planning etc, I made changes in the past year that have put me in a better place financially. However, I still struggle. I took this money very seriously. I'm sharing a huge success.

This is what I used it for:

&#x200B;

* Paid several hundred dollars to my partner who has, over time, loaned me money.
* Saved money for deposit on new apartment.
* Paid my share of rent.
* Paid phone bill & other utilities including laundry for the month.
* Saved money for nutrition program that has been highly effective in addressing my current obesity.
* Bought groceries.
* And treated myself to a few nice things on Amazon!

I have money left because of my regular income and I no longer owe anyone anything. THE FEELING IS AMAZING. I'm fully aware that others have larger debts, but that's totally not the point. I just feel... lighter. Ya know?

SO, hey! What'd you do/what are you going to do with your stimulus check?
