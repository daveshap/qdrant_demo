Am I wrong?
So I work at a restaurant, tonight I was scheduled to get off at ten, but the manager who was suppose to close called in like he always does. 


I was suppose to leave on a trip with my family after I got off work. They scheduled the trip around the time I got off so I wouldn’t get left behind. 


So I called the Gm in a panic because it wasn’t my day to close and no one let me know ahead of time to ask if it was going to be OK with me. I felt bad for my family because they specifically planned the trip around my time. 


After I called the GM he told me that the reason he called in was because the closing manager’s grandma is in the hospital having surgery. 


The manager who was suppose to close had a family emergency so they resorted to me closing because I was already there.


In the end, they got the other guy to come in and finish the shift, like he was suppose to do. He was upset at me for not closing for him. 


But we each have our own individual lives. No one asked me if I had anything going on to see if I was okay with closing. So now I’m on my way to the visit my family up north. 


Should I feel bad for not closing for the manager?
