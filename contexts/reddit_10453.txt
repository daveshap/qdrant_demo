I’m losing everything
Due to severe depression, I lost my job and have absolutely no money. I have bills to pay and no way to pay them. My lease is up in less than two weeks and I have no money for a new place and I haven’t even started packing yet. I’ve filled out countless applications and haven’t heard anything. I’m so scared and I don’t know what to do!!!
