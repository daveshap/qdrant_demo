What would you do if on your first date your date calls you at the time you were supposed to meet and told you they would be 30 minutes late, then 30 minutes later texted you and said they would be even more late?
This happened to me over the weekend, after the first call I jokingly told her she was paying for dinner because we were going to dinner and movies. Then after the next time she texted me she’d be late I told told her again and she said “if you’re serious I don’t have to come.” I then told her I’m serious and she hung up on me. She then texted me paragraphs telling me how I was being a dick for disrespecting her for being a little late
