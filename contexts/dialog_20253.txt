PETER: So. You found him.
FAITH: You found him. I don't know how to thank you.
PETER: Well, it looks like we both lucked out. I just met somebody myself. Somebody my aunt introduced me to.
FAITH: Oh. That's nice.
PETER: Yeah.
PETER: And she's a knock-out, too.
FAITH: Well, good. Good for you.
PETER: Anyway, that's why I came by. I need to fix this button. Do you have a needle and thread?
