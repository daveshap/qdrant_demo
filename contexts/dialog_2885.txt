NICK: But you said you liked men to use their hands.
CATHERINE: No. I said I liked Johnny to use his hands. I don't give any rules, Nick. I go with the flow.
CORRIGAN: Did you kill Mr. Boz, Ms. Tramell?
CATHERINE: I'd have to be pretty stupid to write a book about a killing and then kill him the way I described in my book. I'd be announcing myself as the killer. I'm not stupid.
TALCOTT: We know you're not stupid, Ms. Tramell.
LT. WALKER: Maybe that's what you're counting on to get you off the hook.
NICK: Writing a book about it gives you an alibi for not killing him.
CATHERINE: Yes it does, doesn't it?
CATHERINE: The answer is no. I didn't kill him.
GUS: Do you use drugs, Ms. Tramell?
CATHERINE: Sometimes.
