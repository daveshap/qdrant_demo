Is it possible to remove the link to the Support-a-Creator feature? A few days ago, I entered a Creator ID for the Fortnite Share the Love event and bought an item to get the free wrap in the 7.40 patch update.Now, I don't want to support a creator anymore. I tried blanking out the creator name, then submit but it was telling me \"Connection error. Please try again later\" on Switch and PC.Looking into the Support-a-Creator FAQ, I cannot find any information concerning removing the supported creator. Changing the supported creator works just fine. Do I really have to keep supporting a creator?
