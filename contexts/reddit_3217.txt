How do I give my 2 week notice?
I started my current job about 5 months ago. While I don’t like the job, the people are wonderful and it’s tearing me up thinking about leaving them. However, I got the opportunity for a once in a lifetime 3 month tour of Europe and I can’t pass it up. What is the best thing to say in this situation when I give my 2 weeks to keep a positive relationship and let me know I appreciate everything they’ve taught me over the last 5 months. I’ve asked the people around me and have received many different answers (ex. Overly honest, lie, don’t give notice).
