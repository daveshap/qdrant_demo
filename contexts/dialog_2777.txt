AUDREY: Barton, I'm afraid it's not a good time-
MAYHEW: Drown all those rascals...
BARTON: I'm sorry, I just feel like –I know I shouldn't ask, I just need some kind of help, I just, I have a deadline tomorrow-
MAYHEW: I said drown 'em all! Who is that?
AUDREY: All right Barton, I'll see if I can slip away-
MAYHEW: Who is that?! Gaddamn voices come into the house... sons of bitches...
BARTON: If you could, I'd –
AUDREY: If I can. He gets jealous; he-
MAYHEW: Goddamn voices... DROWN 'EM!
BARTON: I need help, Audrey.
AUDREY: I'll try to slip out. If he quiets down, passes out... I'm afraid he thinks – well, he said you were a buffoon, Barton. He becomes irrational–
MAYHEW: Hesh up! Be still now! DROWN 'EM! DROWN 'EM! DROWN –
AUDREY: Hello, Barton.
BARTON: Audrey, thank you for coming. Thank you. I'm sorry to be such a... such a... Thank you.
AUDREY: Now that's all right, Barton. Everything'll be all right.
BARTON: Yes. Thank you. How's Bill?
AUDREY: Oh, he's... he drifted off. He'll sleep for a while now. What is it you have to do, exactly?
BARTON: Well I have to come up with – an outline, I'd guess you call it. The story. The whole goddamn story. Soup to nuts. Three acts. The whole goddamn-
AUDREY: It's alright, Barton. You don't have to write actual scenes?
BARTON: No, but the whole goddamn – Audrey? Have you ever had to read any of Bill's wrestling scenarios?
AUDREY: Yes, I'm afraid I have.
BARTON: What are they like? What are they about?
AUDREY: Well, usually, they're... simply morality tales. There's a good wrestler, and a bad wrestler whom he confronts at the end. In between, the good wrestler has a love interest or a child he has to protect. Bill would usually make the good wrestler a backwoods type, or a convict. And sometimes, instead of a waif, he'd have the wrestler protecting an idiot manchild. The studio always hated that. Oh, some of the scripts were so... spirited!
