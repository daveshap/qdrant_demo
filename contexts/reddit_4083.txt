One of my most beautiful, kindest friends recently said "I'm just not the kind of girl that gets approached, and that's ok" and my heart fucking BROKE. Fuck every person that made her believe she's not X or Y "enough" for people to want to know her. You're not worthy of her.
This is a post I saw from a female (Girl A) I follow on Twitter. I wholeheartedly disagreed that guys where *actively* making her friend (Girl B) feel this way and told her so. I asked for more context and she (Girl A) responded "(Girl B) has to be proactive & go out of her way to "chase" more than she should bc no one will "chase" her.

This is where I almost lost my shit because the reality for tons of guys is a lot worse including a few of my best friends. A lot of my friends are basically invisible to women to the point there they've stopped trying all together. Lets just say some of these guys aren't what society deem as attractive and I'm assuming Girl B also falls into this category. The difference is I wouldn't blame all the women for not being attractive to me or my mates. You can't be angry at people who aren't attract to you.

A lot of females agreed with the Girl A initial post and my male friends agreed with me. So what do the men and women of reddit think? I sincerely do feel for Girl B but it's not right to blame all men in my opinion.

TL:DR - Girl blames society/men for not hitting on her friend enough
