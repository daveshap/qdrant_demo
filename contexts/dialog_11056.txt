SENATOR GEARY: There's thirty grand worth of paid off markers -- I never owed that much.
HAGEN: Our mistake. But what does it matter; it was our money. We don't even expect thanks.
SENATOR GEARY: You paid off thirty grand I never owed.
HAGEN: We'll keep it quiet; the people who know are trustworthy...the Committee needn't find out.
SENATOR GEARY: And what's the price of their not finding out.
HAGEN: Simple. Be friendly like us. Not hostile.
SENATOR GEARY: Thanks...friend.
KAY: Yes.
MAN: I'm sorry, Mrs. Corleone. We're not to let you through.
KAY: I'm going to the market.
MAN: If you could just give us a list, we'll pick up anything you want.
KAY: Whose orders are these?
MAN: Mr. Hagen's, ma'am.
