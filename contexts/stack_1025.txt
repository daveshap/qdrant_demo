How do I change my DNS on Ubuntu 18.04? Which DNS should I use? I'm recently interested in DNS for a cleaner, faster &amp; more secure Internet surfing. In my country many websites are obscured and I was told that changing DNS may allow me to use them as I did before. I also don't like to share my metadata with others and some DNSs, such as the ones provided by OpenDNS, seem to provide more privacy to the user.Is it true that changing DNS results in a more secure web experience? How do I change DNS on Ubuntu 18.04, and most importantly, which DNS should I switch to?
