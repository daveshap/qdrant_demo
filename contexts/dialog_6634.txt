LETTY: I love you so much.
MICHAEL: I love you too, Letty. I love you, too.
LETTY: Maybe we could just run away to Tahiti and live on the beach.
MICHAEL: That's the best idea I've heard in a long time.
LETTY: Don't you have a magic trick or something to make this easier?
MICHAEL: How about something better? Like a kiss.
MICHAEL: Would that really be such a good idea for either of us?
LETTY: Just promise me you'll be OK, OK?
MICHAEL: I will. And you make sure you take care of yourself.
