AUGGIE: Hey, man, how's it going?
PAUL: Hi, Auggie.
AUGGIE: Two, right?
PAUL: Uh, better make it one.
AUGGIE: You usually get two.
PAUL: Yeah, I know, but I'm trying to cut down. Somebody's worried about my health.
AUGGIE: Ah-hah.
PAUL: Fine. Or it was until a couple of days ago. A guy from The New York Times called and asked me to write a Christmas story. They want to publish it on Christmas Day.
AUGGIE: That's a feather in your cap, man. The paper of record.
PAUL: Yeah, great. The problem is, I have four days to come up with something, and I don't have a single idea. You know anything about Christmas stories?
AUGGIE: Christmas stories? Sure, I know a ton of 'em.
PAUL: Anything good?
AUGGIE: Good? Of course. Are you kidding? I'll tell you what. Buy me lunch, my friend, and I'll tell you the best Christmas story you ever heard. How's that? And I guarantee every word of it is true.
PAUL: It doesn't have to be true. It just has to be good.
AUGGIE: Take over the register while I'm gone, okay, Jimmy?
