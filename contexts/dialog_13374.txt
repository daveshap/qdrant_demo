SARAH: Why did you do that?
EDDIE: I wanted to see what kind of a day it is.
SARAH: A day like any other. People come, people go.
EDDIE: Give me a drag.
SARAH: What time is it?
EDDIE: Eleven o'clock... I'll be back later.
SARAH: Why?
EDDIE: Come here.
SARAH: Oh, you need a shave. You mustn't go looking like that. There's a razor and shaving cream in the bathroom. Compliments of the house.
EDDIE: What did you say that for, Sarah?
SARAH: How did you know my name was Sarah?
EDDIE: You told me.
SARAH: I lied. When I'm drunk I lie.
EDDIE: Okay. So what's your name today?
SARAH: Sarah. Eddie, look. I've got troubles, and I think maybe you've got troubles. Maybe it'd be better if we just leave each other alone.
EDDIE: I got my things over at the hotel. I'll bring them over later... Come here.
SARAH: I'm not sure... I don't know.
EDDIE: Well, what do you want to know? And why?
