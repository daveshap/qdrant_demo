I don’t know who needs to hear this, but it’s okay to not be okay right now.
We’re living in insane times. The world is changing rapidly. There’s a pandemic killing thousands of people a day. Many of us may have been laid off recently or have reduced hours or wages. Many have lost loved ones and don’t have the space to process their grief. The world is a mess and just getting through the day is enough. You don’t need to be perfect. You just need to do what you need to survive. 

Stay safe out there, friends. We’ll get through this.
