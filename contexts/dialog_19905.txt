ANNA: I'm really sorry about last time. He just flew in -- I had no idea -- in fact, I had no idea if he'd ever fly in again.
WILLIAM: No, that's fine. It's not often one has the opportunity to adios the plates of a major Hollywood star. It was a thrill for me. How is he?
ANNA: I don't know. It got to the point where I couldn't remember any of the reasons I loved him. And you... and love?
WILLIAM: Well, there's a question -- without an interesting answer.
ANNA: I have thought about you.
WILLIAM: Oh no no -- no.
ANNA: Just anytime I've tried to keep things normal with anyone normal -- it's been a disaster.
WILLIAM: I appreciate that absolutely. Is that the film you're doing?
ANNA: Yes -- start in L.A. on Tuesday.
WILLIAM: Would you like me to take you through your lines?
ANNA: Would you? It's all talk, talk, talk.
WILLIAM: Hand it over. Basic plot?
ANNA: I'm a difficult but brilliant junior officer who in about twenty minutes will save the world from nuclear disaster.
WILLIAM: Well done you.
WILLIAM: 'Message from command. Would you like them to send in the HKs?'
ANNA: 'No, turn over 4 TRS's and tell them we need radar feedback before the KFT's return at 19 hundred -- then inform the Pentagon that we'll be needing black star cover from ten hundred through 12.15' -- and don't you dare say one word about how many mistakes I made in that speech or I'll pelt you with olives.
WILLIAM: 'Very well, captain -- I'll pass that on straightaway.'
ANNA: 'Thank you.' How many mistake did I make?
WILLIAM: Eleven.
ANNA: Damn. 'And Wainwright...'
WILLIAM: Cartwright.
ANNA: 'Cartwright, Wainwright, whatever your name is, I promised little Jimmy I'd be home for his birthday -- could you get a message through that I may be a little late.'
WILLIAM: 'Certainly. And little Johnny?'
ANNA: My son's name is Johnny?
WILLIAM: Yup.
ANNA: Well, get a message through to him too.
WILLIAM: Brilliant. Word perfect I'd say.
ANNA: What do you think?
WILLIAM: Gripping. It's not Jane Austen, it's not Henry James, but it's gripping.
ANNA: You think I should do Henry James instead?
WILLIAM: I'm sure you'd be great in Henry James. But, you know -- this writer's pretty damn good too.
ANNA: Yes -- I mean -- you never get anyone in 'Wings of a Dove' having the nerve to say 'inform the Pentagon that we need black star cover.'
WILLIAM: And I think the book is the poorer for it.
