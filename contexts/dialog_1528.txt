SERAFINE: What makes you so sure this will work?
ANDY: I told you. He already tried to contact me once. If you saw his face... He was desperate to tell me something. I owe him this.
SERAFINE: I don't know...
ANDY: Listen, either he wastes away as a pathetic vegetable or he can give what's left of his life to save hundreds of potential victims. He's a McDermott. I know what his choice would be.
SERAFINE: I suppose you're right. But I still don't like it.
