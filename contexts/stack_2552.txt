QGis 3.0 Multiuser Access How does multiuser access work in QGis 3.0?Can multiple people open and edit the same object in a layer and save it at the same time? (Edit: Yes, but it may cause loss of data) <br>Does it warn you before overwriting or does it update automatically after someone edits it? (Edit: No) <br>I am using shapefile data at the moment.<br>Does it work with that or do I have to set up a database-server? <br>If yes, how can I do so?Main goals of the database:all users have read/wirite accessdata edited by multiple users at the same time gives the second user a notification/warning before saving
