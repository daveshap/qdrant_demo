Applying to a highly rank school that has a brand new PhD program?
Hi all! I’m not sure if I should cross-reference with other subs, but figured I should try here first. 
So I need a bit of advice. I’m applying to Sociology programs for 2020 and had been fine-tuning my list before application season starts. 

A school (WashU in St. Louis) previously was on my list for public health. Seeing how high ranked I emailed the program and was kind of given a “nice” can’t wait for you to apply, but your stats aren’t probably good enough to get in email. So it stood on my list with a doubt on applying. 

That being said I just found out that the school will be rolling out a new sociology program. I emailed them and I guess since it’s new the program has a bit more “relaxed” that I meet the requirement. Also, I asked and was told I could work closely with the universities other research centers if my interests are close to them. 

So I guess the question is will it being a new program hurt me later on when it comes to finding a job. Or the school’s rep help?
