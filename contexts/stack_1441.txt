Qi charging multiple devices with single transmitter I am looking for a Qi charging compliant transmitter and have found kits from different manufacturers like ST/TI/Microchip. These kits have one receiver and are tuned to work together.How can I build a transmitter (chip+coil) such that I can transmit power to multiple lower power devices with one transmitter? I haven't been able to get much information on how that can be done.For example, to use a 15W transmitter to power four 3W receivers. Can the transmitter communicate with all devices under the Qi protocol? Will this boil down to designing the coil appropriately or there needs to be support from the transmitter chip as well?
