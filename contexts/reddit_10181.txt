My sister committed suicide last night.
The pain is so heavy in my heart right now. This whole time I thought i was alone, when my sister was feeling the exact same way i am right now. She was only 27. She lives four hours away so we are going to her house now. It’s currently 4:11am in new zealand and all i want to do is cry. We have different dads and we don’t really look a like at all but she was always my number one supporter. She was always there for me and always babysat me when i was little. I have a scar on my pinky from the day she jammed my finger in the door lol. We have so many photos together. She always used to come over for christmas and for my birthdays. I can’t even type right now i’m in so much pain. I still can’t and don’t want to believe this. Someone I knew so well gone just like that.
