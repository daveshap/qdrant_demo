WADE: Looks like you did more than jackoff while I was gone.
GALLAGHER: Maybe re-animating you wasn't such a bright idea. You look like shit.
WADE: Shucks, and I got all dressed up.
GALLAGHER: Twenty years have passed, Wade. Lay it to rest.
WADE: I was set up and you know it... but you swore under oath I was dirty. You helped bury me.
GALLAGHER: Jury found you guilty, not me. I just called it as I saw it. Fuck that. You were brought here for a reason. Doucet's escaped. Re-animated for his parole hearing. Killed a lot of people. Most of them cops.
WADE: I'm not on the force anymore.
GALLAGHER: Well, you've just been taken off the bench.
WADE: I want to see my wife and kid.
GALLAGHER: Later. I want Doucet first.
WADE: I told you. I'm out of the cops and robbers business. Retired twenty years ago. I've been trained as a bus driver. Got a whole route planned and everything. Even nailed down the lingo - '<u>Exact change, please</u>'.
GALLAGHER: I'm going to bring this down hard. I've got an A-1 badass killer loose, an election day after tomorrow, and I'm risking everything on you. You're going to bring him in. I don't care how. If you do, you'll get your freedom. An official pardon from me. A clean slate. A good job. A chance to get back with your family. If you don't want to, I'll put your ass back in the freezer so fast, you'll forget you were ever defrosted.
