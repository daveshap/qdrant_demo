JAEGER: What do you make of them?
EPPS: Shi'ites, I think.
JAEGER: Is that good, or bad?
EPPS: I don't know. They killed Wes.
JAEGER: Why haven't they killed us!?
EPPS: I don't know!
JAEGER: ...Maybe...maybe we can fight our way out.
EPPS: With what? Against how many?
JAEGER: We can't just sit here waiting to die.
EPPS: You come up with a better plan, let me know.
JAEGER: Maybe...maybe if we traded them the gold. If we gave it to them they might let us live; they might not kill us.
