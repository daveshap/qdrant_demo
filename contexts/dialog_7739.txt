CHICO: That was for you.
GROUCHO: I'm sorry I'm not in. I wanted to have a long talk with you... Now look here, my good man, you've got to stop yelling peanuts" in front of the House of Representatives."
CHICO: Oh no, I can't do it.
GROUCHO: You don't want to be a public nuisance, do you?
CHICO: Sure. How much does the job pay? Sure, if there's a chance for advancement.
GROUCHO: You wouldn't consider going over Niagara Falls without a barrel?
CHICO: 'At's-a no good. I went to Niagara Falls once.
GROUCHO: Did you shoot the rapids?
CHICO: No, but I shot some ducks.
GROUCHO: If there was an open season for fellows like you, I'd get myself a hunting license. Anyway, I'm going to make you a sporting proposition. You give up the peanut stand and I'll make you vice-president of the country.
CHICO: Oh, no -- nothing doing. I had a brother who was a vice-president once and that's the last we ever heard of him.
GROUCHO: Well, maybe he's still the vice- president. Now if I were to offer you --
CHICO: Hello... Yes... No, not yet... All right... Goodbye. That was for you again. He wants you to call him up as soon as you get back.
GROUCHO: I don't know what's keeping me. I should've been here a long time ago. Now how about my proposition?
CHICO: What other job you got?
GROUCHO: Let's see -- What've I got in my cabinet besides mice -- I've got it -- how would you like to be Secretary of the Interior?
CHICO: That's no good. I like to work on the outside. I must have something easy.
GROUCHO: Then you don't wanna work hard?
CHICO: I don't wanna work at all.
GROUCHO: In that case you'll have to take a civil service examination -- if you pass I'll put you in the post-office -- stick out your tongue.
CHICO: I don't wanna stick out my tongue.
GROUCHO: Well, if you wanna work in the post- office you'll have to stick out your tongue.
CHICO: Look, I'm a very nervous man. I gotta have a job where I come to work at eleven -- go to lunch at twelve -- and quit at one. And twice a year I gotta have a six month vacation.
GROUCHO: I've got just the job for you -- Secretary of War.
CHICO: 'At's-a fine.
GROUCHO: You know, I'd be lost without a telephone. Now - where were we? Oh, yes - I just made you Secretary of War. The first thing you do is buy ammunition -- you buy it from me and I get 10% commission.
CHICO: What do I get?
GROUCHO: You get half mine and I get half yours.
CHICO: I don't want to buy ammunition -- we no gotta war.
GROUCHO: Then we've gotta start one. Do you know how to start a war?
CHICO: Sure, that's easy. You gotta insult somebody.
GROUCHO: My card.
CHICO: That's a-no good. You gotta insult somebody from another country. Look -- I come from one country. You come from another country. I say something you don't like. You say something I don't like - and I'm insulted.
GROUCHO: Why wasn't I insulted?
CHICO: You was insulted, but you don't know it.
GROUCHO: Then I demand an apology!
CHICO: That's a-no good. If I apologize we no got a war. Look -- I send you a scrap of paper. You send me a scrap of paper -- and we have a scrap.
GROUCHO: You've got a brain after all - and how you get along without it is amazing to me -- Now, who can I insult?... Who do we owe money to?... AMBASSADOR TRENTINO! How about him?
CHICO: He's-a very easy to insult -- I say something to his niece once, and he slapped my face.
GROUCHO: Why didn't his niece slap your face?
CHICO: She did.
GROUCHO: What did you say to her?
GROUCHO: You're lucky I don't slap your face -- you oughtta be ashamed of yourself. Where did you hear that story?
CHICO: You told it to me.
GROUCHO: Oh, yes, I remember -- and I should have slapped Mrs. Teasdale's face when she told it to me... I'm going right out and find Trentino. You go right out and get yourself an army.
GROUCHO: Wait a minute. What kind of an army do you think we oughtta have?
CHICO: I think we oughtta have a standing army, so we can save money on chairs.
