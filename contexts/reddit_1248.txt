Does anyone else feel completely disconnected from who they used to be?
I’ve been experiencing the beginnings of an attack for the past hour or so and all I can think of is that I’m not “me” anymore. Like I’ve left home before I was ready. I keep remembering that I used to like playing music in bands, I used to like to have fun with friends, I used to have hope and make plans, I used to laugh and joke a lot...

I used to be someone else. 

Now, Im somewhere else and I feel like an empty vessel who’s only purpose is to dwell on what used to be, but seemingly can never be again. Nothing seems to matter, and simultaneously, nothing makes any sense. 

It’s so hard to put into words how I’m feeling. It’s like... everything is blank. Empty. And nothing feels real at all. Like, I’m living someone else’s life. And what I do, what I say, what I feel- is irrelevant and pointless. I just want to go home and be who I used to be. But I know I can’t. That person is forever gone. Changed by this disgusting horror that’s consumed me. 

And finding out the cause of this is impossible. There’s no trigger. There’s not single thing that starts it, because it’s a constant. It doesn’t ever stop. I’m currently seeing two therapists, and on two meds, (anxiety and depression) and I think I’m getting worse by the day. It’s like- every day I lose more of me- in the process of becoming something else. I just want it all to stop. 

I miss me so much. 

EDIT: WOW! I’m almost speechless! Thank you ALL for responding to this. I wouldn’t have known that so many of you felt this way too. I kind of feel like that little bumble bee in the No Rain video by Blind Melon. I’ve found my people! And though I’m saddened that there is anyone that feels the way I do- I feel a bit more fortified that I’m part of a larger whole- and army if you will, that is willing to not give in to this problem. Let’s do our best to take the opportunity to become someone else- to become someone better! 

We got this!
