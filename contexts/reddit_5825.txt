Teaching Degree and thinking of getting an MBA for Career Change
Hi there! I'm a 30-year-old who has a teaching degree and has been teaching for the past 5 years. I am thinking of changing my career, and I can't help but feel that if I want to make changes to my professional life, I have to get the ball rolling now. I want to change to a non-teaching job.

I am currently saving up to study for Master of Educational Studies in Belgium. I need about 2 years to save up enough. This was my initial goal up to a few weeks ago. Then I read comments on Reddit and also other websites that if I study for MBA, I will find many doors open to me. I did some research, and one of the top universities in my country that offers MBA program is AACSB-accredited, and I really like how they include a lot of practical stuff like projects instead of just theory-based. I can opt for part-time and attend alternate weekend classes for 2 years. 

My question is:

1) Do my initial teaching degree and a future MBA mesh well together and appeal to employers? Is getting an MBA worth it?

2) Also, I am still thinking of pursuing my Master of Educational Studies after the MBA program. Do you think it's redundant in a way? It's been my dream to study in Belgium, and for so long this has been my goal.
