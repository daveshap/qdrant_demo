Do online courses matter when applying to a job?
Hi, i just graduated this year with a GPA of 3.2 (chemistry major), i've been trying to find any courses that would make my CV better such as "lean six sigma" but it's kinda expensive for me as i don't have a constant income yet (costs around 2k), so i turned to online courses and i'm okay with just gaining the knowledge i need from these courses but I'm curious if employers would actually take them seriously.
