Finally saved up my first $1000
I make about $150/week as a bartender, and man does that comma look good! Don't really have anyone to share it with so i thought i'd post it here.

Unfortunately, I'm about to spend most of it to start a small gardening business, and that's a little bit scary, but also really exciting!

Hopefully I'll see 5 figures in my bank account one day and thanks to all the great advice in this sub that helped me to get to the point in my life where I can actually decide my own future!
