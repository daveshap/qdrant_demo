How are "Basic Human Rights" defined legally? What items currently fall under that category, and why? And what are the arguments for and against including certain items as basic rights? e.g.: Water, food, housing, health care, education, speech, guns, internet access, etc.
I really want to understand [what is legally considered a Basic Human Right, from a U.S. perspective](https://www.theadvocatesforhumanrights.org/human_rights_and_the_united_states/#HR%20and%20US%20Law). Please be specific.

What items are included in Basic Human Rights and what's the basis for including them?

For example, [Elizabeth Warren promotes health care as a basic human right](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/06/27/warren-made-fateful-choice/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.75c54effb748). Conversely, [Rand Paul speaks against that idea](https://www.politico.com/story/2011/05/paul-right-to-health-care-is-slavery-054769), as that would fall under slavery by forcing doctors/nurses/staff to provide their services and labor. This is just one example. 

I really want to pin down the meaning of "Basic Human Rights". I'm posting this in a few different subreddits to get different viewpoints. 

1. What does "Basic Human Rights" mean?
2. What are some items that fall under "Basic Human Rights", from a legal standpoint in the U.S.?
3. What are the arguments for and against including certain items as basic rights?

Water, food, housing, health care, education, speech, guns, internet access, etc. 

Thanks!
