SSH - Remote Login without port forwarding My friends use Ubuntu 16.04 and I use Fedora 27. They're new to Linux, and they ask me for help now and then. Rather than helping them over video calls and stuff, I find it easier to have remote access to their systems via SSH (I've performed this few times when we were connected on the same network, but never when we've been apart). I don't have an internet connection at home. Instead, I turn on my mobile hotspot, and connect my laptop to that. Keeping this in mind, how can I use SSH to login to their systems when we're in two different locations and connected to different networks? (I know I should probably be asking this on the Fedora forums, but I assume that the instructions for Ubuntu and Fedora in this matter will be the same).
