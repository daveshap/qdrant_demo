My life is heading no where fast and i have no idea how to fix it...
Recently I quit my job at this shitty place because i hated it and I can't go back to college because I can't afford the classes. My parents are increasingly annoyed of my presence because im not contributing as much into helping them pay off their debts and bills, note I got my own debt and bills i have to focus on. They basically are telling me to get a job or in a few months start looking for your own place. 




At this point of my life everything is spiraling out of control with new problems arriving into my life mixing with the existing issues i have to deal with. I have no idea how to get out of this jam.
