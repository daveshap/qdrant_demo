Short story where a scientist uses a time-machine to evolve mice with wings A scientist encloses a community of mice inside a machine that makes time go much faster inside the machine. Thus he can breed successive generations of mice incredibly quickly. He breeds the population to have wings and to be intelligent.After innumerable generations he produces the required creatures. He is able to communicate with them but discovers they are curious about their heritage. He invents a mythology that their race comes from the planet Venus.They somehow obtain a space-craft and take off in search of what they believe to be their 'home' planet.I believe it might have been part of an anthology and was probably written before 1970 although that's not certain. The language was English but I can't remember if American or British. There were no characters apart from the scientist and the mice as far as I can remember.
