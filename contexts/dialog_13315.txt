LILA: Did you see that?
NATHAN: What?
LILA: I don't know. Something.
NATHAN: A deer?
LILA: No. Too... upright. Might've been a person.
NATHAN: It might behoove us to turn back at this point.
LILA: Come on.
NATHAN: If it's a person, why should we go see it? It's not like it's nature or anything. It's just a person. Sometimes people who live in the woods don't want to be seen. They live in the woods because they're anti-social, Lila. We have to respect that.
