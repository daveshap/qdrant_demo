Support Vector Machine and Regularization I know that Support Vector Machines are very well suited for high-dimensional data, and I have read that one reason is that they have an \"inbuilt feature selection\". I assume this is due to the fact that Support Vectors are used to build the decision boundary, and other weights could be regularized, i.e. set close to zero. Is this correct, and if so does anyone have this formally or helpful sources?
