JANE: Another thing I can't stand is ...when White House reporters bullshit with each other after a briefing and then one of them has a theory and the other quotes it in his story as White House" sources say..."
TOM: That actually goes on...
JANE: Yes. My room is down here -- I'm not tired. Do you want to keep talking?
TOM: Yes, sure.
JANE: Come on...Even I'm not that hard on myself.
TOM: No, I really got this job on a fluke and wait till you hear where it ends up.
JANE: I was doing sports at the station. The newspaper ran this untrue story that I was leaving and they got all these tons of protest mail. So they made me anchor.
JANE: So great -- right?
TOM: Except I'm no good at what I'm being a success at.
JANE: How are you at back rubs?
