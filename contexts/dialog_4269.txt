REBECCA: Something wrong?
DULANEY: Paley could be a problem tomorrow.
REBECCA: I'm sure you'll be able to handle him.
DULANEY: I'm glad you have such confidence in me.
REBECCA: Don't worry about Paley. He can't touch me. No one can. I've thought it all out.
DULANEY: What does that mean? You've been thinking about the case? Or you thought everything out before you killed Marsh?
