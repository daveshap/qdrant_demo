M.J.: Don't swear at me because we got problems. I'm just giving you the news. I went to a Catholic school; I'll tell you what they teach. On the knuckles they teach.
QUINN: Who've I got to beat up except the messenger? Does this give us anything to go on?
M.J.: I'm checking out anybody who lives like DeSalvo. Records of arrests for rape, especially by a man wearing green. Checking out psychiatric hospitals for his personality profile. Cross check- ing names from arrests for sexual offenses, public fondling. If they've got a German wife. We can keep cops working on this kind of junk for years, and this guy's going to hit again, soon.
QUINN: I know. Get out here.
M.J.: So. Do we tell the media and hope for somebody to come forward with information?
QUINN: Or for some new nutcase to copycat the copycat.
