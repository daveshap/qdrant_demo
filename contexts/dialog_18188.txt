MARANZANO: Even the beasts of the earth know who rightfully reigns.
LUCIANO: They do what I tell 'em.
MARANZANO: Salvatore. Always holding himself above.
LUCIANO: You and me both. Sal-va-to-re.
MARANZANO: We must be friends, Charlie.
LUCIANO: Keep my terms and I won't be your enemy.
MARANZANO: The terms will be mine.
LUCIANO: The guy doin' the job names the price. If you don't like it, you can kill Masseria yourself.
MARANZANO: I will be the Boss of All Bosses.
LUCIANO: What makes you think I give a damn about that Sicilian crap?
LUCIANO: Tell it to the Calabrian. Tell it to the Jews.
MARANZANO: You disrespect our tradition.
LUCIANO: Boss, we got our own tradition. We call it treatin' your friends right, and not bein' a pig for every scrap of glory.
JOE PROFACI: Charlie!
LUCIANO: I do this for you, and you'll leave me and my guys alone. Be the fuckin' Boss of all the other Bosses, but we are gonna be our own Bosses.
