DAVID: This planet is aging in surges.
SAAVIK: And Spock with it. They are joined together.
DAVID: The Genesis wave started a life clock ticking for him and the planet. But at the rate things are going now...
SAAVIK: ... How long?
DAVID: Days... Maybe hours... Protomatter has made the situation unpredictable. I'm sorry.
SAAVIK: It will be hardest on Spock. Soon he will feel the burning of his Vulcan blood.
DAVID: I don't understand.
SAAVIK: Pon Farr. Vulcan males must endure it every seventh year of their adult life.
DAVID: I still don't...
DAVID: Whoever they are, they're getting closer.
SAAVIK: I'll go...
DAVID: No!... I'll do it. Give me your phaser.
SULU: Estimating Genesis 2.9 hours, present speed.
KIRK: Can we hold speed, Mr. Scott?
SCOTTY: Aye, sir, she's got her second wind now.
KIRK: Scan for vessels in pursuit!
