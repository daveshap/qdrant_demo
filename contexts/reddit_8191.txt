Paul Manafort and Donald Trump Jr. met with a Russian lawyer linked to the Kremlin during the election campaign season. Is there precedent for such a meeting, and is it legal?
*EDIT: There's a new wrinkle in the story that I missed when I originally posted this. From the New York Times: "[Trump’s Son Met With Russian Lawyer After Being Promised Damaging Information on Clinton.](https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/07/09/us/politics/trump-russia-kushner-manafort.html?referer=)*

>*President Trump’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., was promised damaging information about Hillary Clinton before agreeing to meet with a Kremlin-connected Russian lawyer during the 2016 campaign, according to three advisers to the White House briefed on the meeting and two others with knowledge of it.*

*I'll add at least one new question based on this story. It will be in italics.*

The source is the *New York Times* story ["Trump Team Met With Lawyer Linked to Kremlin During Campaign."](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/08/us/politics/trump-russia-kushner-manafort.html) This story was also independently confirmed by [ABC News](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-jr-jared-kushner-met-russian-lawyer/story?id=48525401)

Some details:

- The meeting took place at Trump Tower.

- The meeting was confirmed by representatives of Trump Jr. and Jared Kushner.

- The lawyer they met with:

>The Russian lawyer invited to the Trump Tower meeting, Natalia Veselnitskaya, is best known for mounting a multipronged attack against the Magnitsky Act, an American law that blacklists suspected Russian human rights abusers. The law so enraged Mr. Putin that he retaliated by halting American adoptions of Russian children.

- The lawyer's ties:

>Ms. Veselnitskaya was formerly married to a former deputy transportation minister of the Moscow region, and her clients include state-owned businesses and a senior government official’s son, whose company was under investigation in the United States at the time of the meeting. Her activities and associations had previously drawn the attention of the F.B.I., according to a former senior law enforcement official.

- The topic of discussion:

>In his statement, Donald Trump Jr. said: 'It was a short introductory meeting. I asked Jared and Paul to stop by. We primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children that was active and popular with American families years ago and was since ended by the Russian government, but it was not a campaign issue at the time and there was no follow up.' He added: 'I was asked to attend the meeting by an acquaintance, but was not told the name of the person I would be meeting with beforehand.'”
 
- The nature of the meeting's disclosure: 

>The Trump Tower meeting was not disclosed to government officials until recently, when Mr. Kushner, who is also a senior White House aide, filed a revised version of a form required to obtain a security clearance." 

My questions are:

1) Is there any precedent for such a meeting? Are there any indications that this meeting is usual or unusual?

2) Does the meeting violate any law?

3) *Does the new revelation about the possible motivation for the meeting impact its legality?*
