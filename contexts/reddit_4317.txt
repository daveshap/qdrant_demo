Me: “So I guess I’m your gf now? :)” Him: “We don’t need to worry about labels”
So I’ve been seeing a man several times a week for the last 5 months. He’s awesome, I’m awesome. We stay up many nights chatting for hours. We have met each other’s friends. Our goals seem to align. He always tells me I’m the hottest woman he’s ever dated.

Upfront, he told me he was looking for a serious, monogamous, committed relationship. But we had never defined the relationship before.

Well, we were talking about holiday plans this year and meeting each other’s family. He was open to meeting mine but a little hesitant about me meeting his because his family lives farther away and isn’t that close with the ones still living. But I thought to myself “wow we made it this far, I’m just going to confirm I’m his girlfriend :)”

So I say “haha I guess I’m your girlfriend now!” after talking about these travel plans. Totally expecting him to say “of course :)” or something like that.

Instead, he replies with “We don’t really need labels. I mean I would never want to put this on Facebook or anything. I like to keep my dating life completely separate from any of my social media or anything public like that. That’s just how I am.” I did think it was a little fishy because he had never posted a photo of me/us on social media before either.

Is this a red flag after 5 months? 

Should I be walking away? Or is this normal these days?
