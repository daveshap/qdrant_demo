RAMÓN: Did you have to sign a pledge? Not to go back to the line?
ESPERANZA: No, no ... we wouldn't do it.
RAMÓN: But if you go back they'll lock you up again.
ESPERANZA: No, no ... the Sheriff had enough of us. We drove him crazy.
TERESA: It's all set. Consuelo's squad can take they day off tomorrow. We're taking over.
ESPERANZA: Good. Come in, we'll work it out. Sit down, sit down.
RAMÓN: We've got to have a talk, you and me.
ESPERANZA: All right, but later. I've got a meeting now.
RAMÓN: A meeting?
ESPERANZA: Yes. To plan for the picket line tomorrow.
