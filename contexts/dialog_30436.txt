VIRIDIANA: No, Uncle; ashes mean penance and death.
DON JAIME: Then it's penance for you who are going to be a nun; and for me, who am old, it's death ...
DON JAIME: If you like, I will come with you tomorrow to the village when you leave.
VIRIDIANA: Thank you, Uncle.
DON JAIME: This evening we must do something special by way of a farewell.
VIRIDIANA: Whatever you like.
DON JAIME: I should like you to do something for me. It's an innocent sort of thing but I'm very set on it.
VIRIDIANA: Today I can refuse you nothing.
