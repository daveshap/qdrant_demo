LPT: Drink more water
This tip is so obvious, but I know so many people who don't follow it, even when they are complaining about being broke. 

When you eat out, order water to drink. I love this tip, because nobody thinks your doing it to be cheap, they think your doing it to be healthy. BONUS: It is a healthier choice.  

Drink water at home too. Prices aren't nearly as bad for a soft drink or glass of wine when you buy for home, but they are still a lot more than water.  Invest in a filter of some type. I'm using a brita pitcher until I can install a filtration system. Shoot, depending on where you live you might be totally fine with tap water. 

I started doing this in college when I had to scrape by on minimal hours $100 a week via part time hours, plasma donations, and overage checks and still do it most of the time today (15 years later). Small, but easy habit to build and the savings add up pretty quickly.
