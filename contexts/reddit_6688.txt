Should I tell my recruiter?
Tl;dr: Should I tell my recruiter about a (high paying) job that I was pursuing even though I didn't get it? Will the recruiter relay that information to the company to hopefully help with a better offer?

I have been working a job through a staffing agency for 2 months. The pay is really low for me but I needed something, as I told my recruiter, and that I wasn't planning on staying longer than 3 months without a good job offer in the company. He checked in with me every week and I could hear him typing notes as he feigned interest. I always said that the company is good but at the end of the day, I have to have something better. He always replied with there isnt anything (which before all this, I dont know how much I could believe) and to tell him if I had any opportunities come up. 

I came close to a job but didn't get it due to another candidate having more experience in the field. I never told him because I thought it would make it weird at my job knowing that I was trying to go elsewhere or that it would affect his commission so he'd try to keep me where I am. This is my first time dealing with a recruiter. 

Today, I had a chance to talk to my boss at the company saying despite all this going on in the world, that I was wondering if there was discussion of bringing me on board. He said yes but we just haven't had time to sit down with you yet, which I understood. I followed that up with the fact that I need a big bump in pay for me to consider it. We left it at that.
