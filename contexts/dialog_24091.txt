VINCE: Babe, what happened here? Look at you.
CHRISTY: Good evening, Vincent.
VINCE: What, Vincent? This is me, doll. I know you. What did you think you were doing? Running to the cops. Hiding out. No, no. You're sorry now, aren't you?
CHRISTY: I am sorry for all my sins. And yours.
WILLY: She's a nun, Vince.
VINCE: I love you, Chris. I always will. I gave you so much. My time. My affection. A big-time career. And how do you repay me? What's the thanks I get? Where's the loyalty, huh? Where's the love?
