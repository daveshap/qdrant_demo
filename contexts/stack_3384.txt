Japanese anime movie, includes a sword and some gems, and a dragon-like friend I watched this movie when I was a kid and never discovered it again.It\u2019s about a boy whose father left him after his divorce from the mother, the kid enters a world somehow where he has a big sword he needs to keep searching for precious stones to fill it with. it has certain holes that look like each stone shape! I also remember the kid going to eat with his mythical (dragon-like friend), and he gets stuck in the restaurant because the crazy restaurant lady won\u2019t let him leave without finishing huge amounts of food!The kid also gets bullied so I\u2019m guessing the the swords journey is to teach the kid how to deal with all of this...
