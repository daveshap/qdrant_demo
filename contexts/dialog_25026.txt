OCK: Myâ€¦ self. I don't matter. This human life, all life- insignificant. Bodies-- bags of sleepy, sluggish flesh.
ROZ: All right, we may be insignificant, imperfect creatures-- but we're all we've got.
OCK: You're wrong. Just for a moment, I heard, saw, felt-- I became Creation.
ROZ: Creation? Or its opposite?
OCK: Truth. Pure, eternal. Beyond the boundaries of mere mortality.
ROZ: Otto, we are mere mortals. You must never forget your own limits--
OCK: I'll repeat the experiment. I will hold the truth. That's the only thing that matters.
ROZ: No. It isn't.
ROZ: Life and death matter. Yours-- everyone's. By comparison, our search for truth is only a product of curiosity, a game--
OCK: Oh, Roz. My mind is so far beyond yours now. I could beat you at chess now.
