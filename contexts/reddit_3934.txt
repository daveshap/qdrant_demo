To all those that feel lonely or depressed about being single.
As someone who is 33 and has never been on a date or ever dated anyone before I Just wanted to let those of you out there that feel lonely or depressed about being single that it's ok. Just because you don't have someone else special in your life doesn't make you unlovable. There are people that do care for you. Some days being single are going to be tougher than other days, some days you'll feel incredibly more lonely than others, and some days you'll feel more broken than any other day you've felt. The important thing is to feel what You're feeling and to move past it. Don't try to bottle up your emotions just for the sake of convenience. They will build up, fester, and come out when You're at your most vulnerable state. Remember that we're only here for a short time so please do yourself a favor and enjoy as much of it as you can.
