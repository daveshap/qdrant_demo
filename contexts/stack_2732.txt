If the axion is discovered would it be an add on to the Standard Model? Just curious to know if the axion was ever discovered would it contradict the Standard Model?  Or is it just the case that it would be add on? Which leads one to wonder ...how do physicists decide if an add on is  worthy to be an add on since it may lead to a contradiction if the original theory does not predict it?  Just curious.
