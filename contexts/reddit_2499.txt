Tips for getting around being a nervous wreck during interviews?
In the past 6 months I have screwed up two interviews to potential dream jobs. The story is always the same - I get past the screening stage but when it gets to the interview I panic if I get asked a question I’m unprepared for. I think it comes down to anxiety and my inability to really “think on my feet” during a high stress interview situation.

What can I potentially do to get better at this? I’ve read improv classes are great to learn to “think on your feet - can someone vouch for this?

Edit: I practice like crazy before my interviews! Im an anxious over-prepper! What catches me is if I get asked a question that I haven’t really prepared for - I.e. I’m struggling to think on my feet in those situations. 

Background: I’m in my late 20s, speak 2.5 languages, have two degrees, am finishing my masters part time and I’m currently employed in a big Government Department.
