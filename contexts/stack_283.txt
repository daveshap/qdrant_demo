Is my keyboard compatible with MacBook Pro I have ordered a Hyperx alloy elite RGB, but I was wondering whether it would be compatible with my MacBook Pro [Mojave 10.14.] In some forums I read it might not be compatible. If it is not compatible is there any possible way that I can make it work with my MacBook Pro?
