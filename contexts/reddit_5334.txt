I got a job with a company I really really wanted to work for and I haven’t told anyone except my family
I’m a student and I got hired through my co-op program at school but I have struggled for SO LONG trying to get hired. It’s taken me 4 years, Hundreds of resumes and cover letters, sleepless nights, and interviews that were horrible. I use to brag about interviews and then when nothing happened I would just feel like shit. Now that I finally did get hired, I don’t want to fucking tell anyone. In reality, it’s no one’s business to know anything. Right now I’m just mostly excited and trying to humble myself because I can lose shit with a snap of a finger. It’s a temporary contract but it’s better than nothing.
