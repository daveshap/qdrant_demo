Suicidal people don’t want to die, they just want the pain to stop.
I hate this quote. I want to die. No one can tell me about my own feelings because I live through my own personal hell every single day. 
Edit. I’d meant that I hate this quote. I am not saying this to any of you all. I am not invalidating your experience or telling you you feel a certain way.
