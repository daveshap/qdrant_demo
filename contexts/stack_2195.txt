Which Windows Apps are required to run Windows Games (XBox crossplay) Setting up my PC I used Powershell to permanently delete all the unnecessary bloat from my PC, and this included apps such as:XboxAppXboxGameOverlay XboxIdentityProviderXboxSpeechToTextOverlayI Am wondering if anyone knows which of these I need to reinstall from an ISO to enable sufficient functionality for Crossplay with a friend (XB user)? No rush, I just want to get myself sorted out for when State of Decay 2 hits.Bonus question: Is it absolutely necessary to be signed into a Microsoft account (rather than a basic user account) to make app purchases from the Windows Store, and further to enjoy XBLA?
