It just costs too much to live
I can’t handle poverty any more. Everything is too expensive. I’m afraid to use my heat this winter because the electric bill would be too much. I have a radiator and a pile of blankets, but if I don’t run the heat the pipes will freeze and I can’t pay to fix that if they burst. 

I don’t wanna live because all I do is pay bills. There’s no enjoyment in my life, just constant stress and worry and fear that I’ll end up homeless. 

Everything is a struggle. I have to strategically be late on certain bills so the service doesn’t get shut off but I can pay one thing while I neglect another. Interest on my loans and credit cards makes it so I don’t seem to make progress paying anything back. 

I just can’t take it anymore.
