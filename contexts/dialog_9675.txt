JACK: Parry, it's Lydia Sinclair - our membership winner.
PARRY: I know!
ANNE: What are you two up to?
JACK: Well..everything's closed up. We thought we'd get some dinner. Say!....Anybody up for Chinese? Have you eaten? Would you like to come along?
LYDIA: Oh, no..I have to get home...
ANNE: The nails!! Watch the nails!!... Listen, you still have to eat.
LYDIA: No really..I can't.
ANNE: Hey? What did I tell you? Why don't you come? It's just dinner. You'll have something to tell your mother next time she calls.
