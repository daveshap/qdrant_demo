Ho should I skip a class and is it acceptable?
So on the next upcoming school day which is Monday since I'm on spring break me and my friend are going to skip a class to hangout in the library. I get good grades and I never have to worry about studying because learning comes easy to me. I am in all honors classes. The reason I am skipping is simply because I am bored with my life. I want some excitement. I was an introvert and socially awkward. Now I have mostly gotten rid of my constant blushing and awkwardness. Now onto my friend. He is always skipping class and school I guess because he would rather have a good time. He doesn't like his parents checking on him and is failing school. He is most likely staying back. Don't get me wrong, he a great person but simply doesn't care about school.  
My plan is to get an appointment with my guidance counselor so I can get a pass. Once I have said pass, I will calmy walk to the library which is en route to the guidance office. I have never been in major trouble before and have never broken any big rules. 
TL;DR What are some tips to skip class? What's the worst that could happen? Why should I not skip class?
