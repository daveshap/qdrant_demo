Worked at corporate research lab, now doing PhD. Most academic research in my area seems meaningless. What to do?
 Full  disclosure: I am not a typical EE PhD student.  I worked in industry  for 15 years while getting a MSEE along the way. I am faculty at an R1  school without a PhD.  It may sound strange, but its really not.

Anyways,  I advise the group i run to stay away from producing cockroach papers,  papers that incrementally build on the state of the art in the most  minimal way possible.  My advisor's group on the other hand seems to  thrive on these papers.  Its \*very\* frustrating and I'm not sure what to  do.  Although he is well known in the field and has published hundreds  of more papers than I have, I generally am always well funded and  sponsors like working with our group.

I  am about to begin my second project for my PhD doing segmentation. The  imagery i am using is from a very uncommon phenomenology but effectively  looks like a speckled photograph. I have been spending weeks  characterizing my data trying to apply a domain prior to it to improve  segmentation.  There is currently nothing in the literature that comes  even close to a off the shelf deep learning network.  My advisor wants  me to take Haralick features and initialize them as the conv weights (im  skipping a lot of detail here but i hope you get the idea) and publish  that.  This seems trivial and if i reviewed this paper, i would clearly  reject it.  However, many ppl from my advisors lab are doing this and  getting papers through.  It makes no sense and I am clearly frustrated  with this whole process.  Such efforts seem obvious and like a complete  waste of time thinking about and going through the pains of writing up.
