CARTER: There'll be a team of Surgeons standing by. We're prepared to remove you immediately, should anything go wrong. In any event, you must be out within sixty minutes. After that, you'll be in danger of attack.
GRANT: Attack? Who -- or should I say what from?
REID: Benes' natural defenses. White Corpuscles -- Antibodies. Once you begin to grow -- and become a menace to the body -- you'll trigger them off... MICHAELS With all the unknown factors in the body, I still say risking five lives for one is something we should reconsider --
CARTER: We understand your concern, but we've made our decision, Doctor. Any questions? Anybody?
GRANT: Just one, General...
CARTER: Yes?
GRANT: Where can I get a cab back to town?
