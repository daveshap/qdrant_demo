PIMENOV: Good evening -- my key -- one sixty- eight.
BARON: Good evening, Mr. Pimenov.
PIMENOV: Oh -- good evening, Baron.
BARON: How's the beautiful lady?
PIMENOV: Grusinskaya -- well, to tell the truth, Baron -- tonight we are a little bit nervous. Were you at the theatre last night?
BARON: Certainly -- always when Grusinskaya dances.
PIMENOV: Well -- last night was not so good.
BARON: I thought she was splendid!
PIMENOV: Yes -- but the audience.
