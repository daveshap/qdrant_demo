BOURNE: How do they know that? How can they know any of that?
NICKY: What is this, a game?
BOURNE: I want to hear it from you.
BOURNE: Say it.
NICKY: Last week an Agency field officer went to make a buy from a Russian national.
BOURNE: A Russian?
NICKY: It was Pamela Landy's op. The guy was going to sell-out a mole or something. I haven't been debriefed on exactly what it was.
BOURNE: Last week? When?
NICKY: And you got to him before we could.
BOURNE: I killed him???
NICKY: You left a print! There was Kel that didn't go off! There was a partial print, they tracked it back to Treadstone! They know it's you!
BOURNE: I left a fingerprint! You fucking people.
