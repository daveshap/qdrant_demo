Question about Loans for grad school
I’m starting grad school for the first time in the fall and will be attending full time. I’m hoping to revive an assistantship position which will cover nearly all of my tuition and a stipend. I don’t know how much this stipend will be. In your experiences, have stipends been enough to live on or would I need to take out student loans? If I need to take out federal loans, how do I go about doing that? In undergrad the financial aid office basically just did it for me so I have no clue how to go about it or how much I’ll need. I’m hs I g a hard time finding an apartment not knowing how much money I’ll have!
