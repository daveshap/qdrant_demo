SUE: Didn't you girls say you went to a conservatory?
JERRY: Yes. For a whole year.
SUE: I thought you said three years.
JOE: We got time off for good behavior.
SUE: There are two things I will not put up with during working hours. One is liquor - and the other one is men.
JERRY: Men?
JOE: Oh, you don't have to worry about that.
JERRY: We would be caught dead with men. Those rough, hairy beasts with eight hands - They all want just one thing from a girl.
BIENSTOCK: I beg your pardon.
SUE: All right, girls - from the top again.
