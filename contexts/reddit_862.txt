I always want to post in this subreddit but I know I’ll feel like a failure if I don’t get upvotes.
Does this happen to anyone else? I actually think this sub is a great tool for cathartic sharing among people with anxiety, and I know I could derive some benefit in allowing myself to post more. But there’s some silly irony in me thinking “Well what if this gets ignored? What if people think this is dumb or invalid?”. Even right now as I type this I think “Oh yeah this is so witty and meta, this will definitely get me to the top of the sub” which is so in line with every obsession I have about being special, being great, being loved, etc — and my inability to just do or enjoy the small things for what they are without some greater sense of meaning. 

EDIT: Ha, this blew up, how poetic. The joy or validation I feel from the upvotes doesn’t match the negativity I would have felt if it went unnoticed, which is good to know! You all are wonderful and this is a great community. I’ve come a long way with my anxiety and I’m working on a project to help and give back to those struggling and those who have helped me, so I hope to see you all here again. ❤️❤️❤️
