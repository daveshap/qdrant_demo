I asked a guy out. I did it guys.
I asked a guy out for drinks. We met up. He paid even tho I asked him out, totally prepared to pay for everything. And now we are officially dating. I took a chance. I went ham. I said fuck my insecurities. 

I landed a unicorn. He has respected all of my boundaries. He asks questions. He does not judge me for my past. Its incredible. 

Just go for it. Ask that guy out. Ask that girl out. The worst thing is they say no and you move on. Do it. You should be happy. But you will never know until you try.

Edit: I am a girl. An over weight girl at that.

Edit 2: I appreciate every single one of you. And it's so uplifting and moving to see that I could inspire even a few people. You are all worth more than you believe you are. Even just pretending that you feel that way can inspire change inside of you. That's what I did and it worked. Good luck my loves!
