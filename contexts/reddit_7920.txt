At what point do you decide that you've researched enough?
I'm only in the first semester of my master's program, so I haven't gotten too heavy into research, but I do enjoy researching for my papers, even when it doesn't need to be that much

As I work on a couple of papers, I've been wondering if I'm overdoing it, or if I've researched enough to the point where any extra research produces marginal gains

How do you figure out that you've researched enough and it's time to actually start writing?
