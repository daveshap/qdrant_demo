COREY: Then what's love?
LLOYD: I'm gonna call her.
COREY: Diane Court doesn't go out with guys like you. She's a brain.
DC: Trapped in the body of a gameshow hostess.
COREY: Diane Court does not realise how good-looking she is.
LLOYD: Sounds great to me, I'm going to call her, that's what's cool about her.
COREY: Brains stay with brains. The bomb could go off and their mutant genes would form the same cliques.
DC: I wouldn't get my hopes up Lloyd.
COREY: I'm sorry. It's just you're a really nice guy, and we don't want to see you get hurt.
