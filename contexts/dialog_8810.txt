ARTHUR: Quiet. You'll wake the men, and they must fight tomorrow for their very lives.
MERLIN: I know. I have heard noises and echoes through the stones...
ARTHUR: What is this place, Merlin?
MERLIN: It is like a tree. The roots of the stones spread out across the land and they draw on the thoughts and actions of men. Like sap those human matters course through the stones feeding the stars that are the leaves of the tree. And the stars whisper back to men the future course of events. But the earth is being torn apart, its metals stolen, and the balance is broken and the lines of power no longer converge. In fact, I nearly didn't make it in one piece.
MERLIN: But, I'm here.
ARTHUR: Where have you been these many years? Is it true that Morgana--
MERLIN: --Stories... You brought me back. Your love brought me back. Back to where you are now, in the land of dreams...
ARTHUR: Is this a dream? Tell me, Merlin!
