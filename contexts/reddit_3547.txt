Are we a load of single people giving each other advice on how to date...
I love this sub and the advice, discussions and opinions on here. 
But I’m wondering if most the people on thus sub are single? 
I can’t help but think if you’re good at dating and successful you’re probably not going to be too interested in this sub. So are we just a load of single people who aren’t very good at dating giving each other advice?
