HANOVER: You remember the first time we met Finnegan? I think you were just starting out...smuggling gold off Sumatra for those two Chinese...what did we use to call them?
FINNEGAN: Fok Yu and Fok Yu Two...are we strolling down memory lane for any particular reason?
HANOVER: No, it just struck me as odd...I don't see you for all these years and you've still got the same tape stuck in the box.
FINNEGAN: You know what they say...the classics are eternal.
