Stop assuming we have people who care about us
It's so annoying to here the "think about the people who care about you" line. A lot of us don't have those people. This isn't me being mellow dramatic or delusional, this is just my life. It also implies that youre life is only worth living because other people care about you, which is bullshit even if you do have people who care about you.

I can't make a list if all the annoying shit people say to suicidal people but this is by far the worst because they make assumptions about your life. People don't realize the privilege of having friends and a loving family so they assume we all do.
