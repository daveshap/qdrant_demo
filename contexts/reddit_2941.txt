Should I leave a toxic work environment after only 3 months of working there? I was previously unemployed for 8 months prior to taking this job.
About a year ago, I left a terrible job. I had stayed for a year and it was the longest year of my life. The job was 100% travel, I was frequently required to work 60+ hour weeks, management was unsupportive, and there was a severe lack of training, resources, and staff. I took 4 months off to recover from health issues related to my job, then 4 months later I landed another position.

I have been with my new company for about 3 months now, and unfortunately, it shares many of the same problems as my old company. Though the work itself is ideal for this stage in my career, the company culture is extemely toxic, and I am miserable. Here are some things other people have said about my new company (which I can agree with, from my short time there):

* "HIGH turnover."
* "Terrible work culture."
* "Unrealistic expectations."
* "Stifling company culture adds to low morale." 
* "Lack of resources from excessive penny pinching - both manpower and equipment - to do efficient work."
* "Severe lack in manpower due to high turnover, which results in other employees being overloaded."
*  "You will not be treated like you are human, they do not value or respect their employees."

Shortly before I accepted this position, 4 out of 5 team members all left within the same month. Then I was hired, and now the 5th team member is leaving, meaning I will be the only person left working under my manager (who is the cause of the mass exdous). Things are unlikely to change and I have to go. 

At this point I have 3 options:

1. Submit my 2 weeks notice immediately. If I do this I will have 5 months of experience on my resume (May-Sept).
2. Submit my 2 weeks notice in a month. If I do this I will have 6 months of experience on my resume (May-Oct).
3. Wait until I have something else lined up.

I understand that it is always ideal to have another job lined up before quitting, but I really want to leave ASAP. Every day at this place feels like a week, and I have constant anxiety. I don't sleep well, and a lot of my time outside of work is consumed by thinking about work, and trying to figure out how to get out of this situation. I also want to add that I have money saved up for maybe about 6 months of unemployment.

My biggest concern is how this will look on a resume. Is 5 months enough time to leverage my experience to help me land a similar position with a different company? Is there any difference between staying 5 months versus staying 6 months? If I have 8 months of unemployment followed by 5 months at a job and another period of unemployment, will that make me look "unhireable"? What is everyone's thoughts on my best option?
