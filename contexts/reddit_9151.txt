It's possible to make an extra $1,000 a month working online. A basic beginners guide.
Update: I posted a [follow-up](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/8c9in2/last_week_i_posted_a_guide_on_making_1000mo/?ref=share&ref_source=link) to this post with more info and added revenue streams. You can also check out my post on [using apps to save money and earn cash back](https://www.reddit.com/user/SuperSecretSpare/comments/au5am7/saving_money_online_in_2019/).

I put all of this info into an e-book, plus another 80 pages of content. I tried to make it free, but Amazon requires a $0.99 minimum (still free with Kindle Unlimited). So, if you're interested, it can be found [here](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07HT46CQR?pf_rd_p=d1f45e03-8b73-4c9a-9beb-4819111bef9a&pf_rd_r=RFDQ1E7D2RN3X26A3126).

Time investment required for these numbers: 30-40 hours a week. Feel free to work less or more. 40 hours a week is only a requirement if you want to make over $1,000 following this guide.

Tech required for these numbers: A working laptop, a cellphone (in some cases), and an internet connection. Alternatively, just go to the library a few hours a day.

This is a slightly modified and edited post that I made on another sub. I know that when I was trying to improve my life, working online opened a lot of additional doors for me. I was able to eat when I wanted instead of when I could afford it, I have been able to get my car paid off a little sooner, and have been able to afford more luxuries like taking the wife out on weekly dates.

Working online is something that pretty much anyone can do. If you are already browsing Reddit, you have the tools to make additional income. I am including payment proof as well as direct links to all of the sites, so everyone can see that it is actually possible and get started today. These are all legit sites and I have not been scammed or jipped by any of them for any amount. Feel free to do your own research about their trustworthiness if need be. 

This is by no means a comprehensive guide to everything you can do online to make extra cash, nor is this really that impressive a number to make. This does not include some of the more well known sites like swagbucks or earnhoney, as I just do not like them that much. It does not include sites like Rat Race or Appen. It also does not include tutoring Chinese kids with some of the well known sites. This is more a quick overview of how I personally boosted my monthly income by almost $1,000 a month working with six different websites. While I am in America, many of these sites can be used worldwide. Hopefully someone can find a new revenue stream through this write-up.

The times I have invested vary greatly, from one or two hours a day to well over 12 hours a day. I average somewhere around $6.25 an hour (admittedly never giving it 100% attention),  but to me that is better than making nothing an hour. While it may seem excessive some days, I actually enjoy making money and I do some of it while I am at my day job, so it has become more of a time filler than actual work. Everyone will have their own experience but these are what have worked the best for me, either in time investment or having a little fun along the way.

**SwagBucks** ($225) Surveys – Majority of countries– This is more of a catch-all for stuff to do when you want to make and save money. You can do surveys, play games, and watch videos to earn points. You can also get cash back from using SB to visit and buy from different stores. You get paid in points which can be used to purchase gift cards or sent directly to PayPal. Each point is the equivalent of $0.01. Usually, SB will have deals where you can get certain gift cards for less. For example, a $20 Amazon gift card for 1800 SB points. The payout can be slow, but if you don’t mind running ads in the background, using a plug-in to save money while you shop, or killing time playing a game, SwagBucks can be a great way to earn $20 a month.

**Mturk** ([$2,400](https://imgur.com/1EPHq64)): This is by far the one I spend the most time on and has been the best earner. This site lets humans perform small tasks that robots still cannot do well. It is owned by Amazon. Downside is there are slim pickings on weekends and when colleges are out on vacation. I typically stick to surveys, but once in a while do batch jobs which there are more of. You have to wait a week for your first payout, which will go to an Amazon payment account. You can the get payouts one time per day after that. Approval for mturk can sometimes be a pain in the ass, almost impossible if you are not from the US, but is definitely worth it in my opinion if you can get approved. www.mturk.com

**Respondent.io** ([$1,300](https://imgur.com/a/ITb6G)): This site allows users to screen for online or in-person surveys and focus groups. The pay is amazing, easily averaging $125 per test. I only average getting approved for the groups about 10% of the time (I have filled out about 200 screeners and have been selected for 20 studies). Thankfully, each screener only takes me a few minutes to fill out. I have made up to $200 with one hour of work doing an in person focus group. Most focus groups are done through webcam, so you don't even have to leave your house. They payout via PayPal 7 days after the activity is complete.

**Usertesting** ([$600](https://imgur.com/sxUwXW8)): This site allows you to review new websites and apps. The pay is usually $10 per recorded test lasting 10-15 minutes. Sometimes the pay is more, but never less. I average a few tests a week. Some weeks I will get a dozen tests, other weeks nothing. This one is great to practice your feedback skills, which open up a lot of other doors. Pay is through PayPal, one week (to the minute) after the test is complete. www.usertesting.com

**Redbubble** ([$60](https://imgur.com/wobuyuz)): [My store](https://www.redbubble.com/people/7secondman). After getting rejected by merch by Amazon, I came here. You design and publish t-shirts, clocks, mugs, phone cases, and about 20 other mixed products, with each sell netting you a few bucks. They are based in Australia, and do pay-outs once a month on the 15th via PayPal. I have only been at this one for about two months, but see the potential it has. It also takes a good amount of upfront work before you see any dividends. You do all of the uploading and just wait for people to find it with keywords or searches. Great if you are artistic or know how to use any creative software. www.redbubble.com

**PlaytestCloud** ($150): This is just simple game testing. It is super fun, very quick, and you get to test new games before anyone else. They send you tests for different listed devices, you download the game file, and they record your screen. The only issue I have with this one is that you are only able to test 3-4 games per month, at $9-$11 each. Paid almost immediately after each test via PayPal. No payment proof available as it is not all saved in one place. www.playtestcloud.com

**Reddit subs**($400): From test driving cars, to doing homework, to rating businesses, these subs have been a catch all for when I have any extra time to go through them. Honestly, this has probably been the third best pay per hour of work out of everything, after Respondent and Prolific. I just wish there were gigs to find all day. Be careful not to get scammed here. Some people are just... something else.

Well, that is all I have for now. I hope someone can get something from this. Feel free to share any other revenue streams you may have and feel free to ask any questions you may have. I will answer the best I can.

Edit: This isn't a get rich quick scheme. And it isn't a way to make anywhere near minimum wage online. This post if for people willing to sacrifice free time to make a few extra bucks.

Edit II: Holy fuck, I get it. A second job would pay better. This is for people who want extra money without having to get a second job, are confined to their house for whatever reason, have unusual hours free, or for people (like me) that prefer making a bit extra sitting around in their underwear eating cereal not having to deal with other people.

Edit III: I still understand a part time job will pay way more than this. If you would rather have a part time job, or deal with the stress of deliverables and bosses, have at it. Please stop.

Edit IV: u/gordigor did an [excellent write-up](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/8asxdk/its_possible_to_make_an_extra_1000_a_month/dx25udg?utm_source=reddit-android) on a more passive way to earn around $50 a month.
