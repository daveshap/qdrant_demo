How do I meet men when I have no social circle?
This is currently my life: go to work and come home. Before that it was go to school and come home. I have never had a social circle, my two closest friends were online that I no longer talk to. Other than meeting people online, how can a mid 20s girl find some potential partners? I understand that I am not social enough, but very rarely do guys wanna talk to me or even be friends with me in real life. Online I feel like it’s easier to meet people because 1) you’re just typing on a screen 2) you know wherever you are online, there are similar people similar to how this subreddit is. As someone in my mid 20s is it possible 1) to create a social circle or is it too late since most people already have established social circles at this age? 2) is it possible to find potential partners in real life without having to look online in this day and age with online dating so prevalent?
