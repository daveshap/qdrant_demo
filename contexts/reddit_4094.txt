Ladies mostly, does anyone else refrain from being the one to text first to seem like you’re playing it cool? Guys weigh in too.
I’ve realized that I avoid texting guys I like first as an attempt to not seem clingy. I feel like women are conditioned now to play down their feelings because the worst thing we could be seen as is being clingy or needy, or showing that we’re interested because men like “a chase”. I realize I have possibly sabotaged many texting stages with men in the past who may have been more interested than I assumed because I wanted to seem cool and carefree, but probably came off as uninterested. I’ll be the one to text first now, but I still like when a guy is mostly the first one to reach out. 

Maybe I am overthinking, but I’m just wondering if anyone else relates?
