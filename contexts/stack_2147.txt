Uplay Games not Launching I have 2 Ubisoft games on Steam, Assassin's Creed III and Valiant Hearts. I've bought them a while ago, and they seemed to work, I've played them a lot.But now, when I try to run them, the mouse icon loads for a few seconds and nothing. Nothing happens. I checked my computer processes and there is no \"Valiant Hearts\" or \"Assassin's Creed III\" process running. I can't launch the game from the shortcut, nor steam, nor the Uplay launcher.What I have tried:Reinstalling Uplay: This seemed to work in the first place (before I did that, the uplay launcher wouldn't launch as well). After reinstalling, the uplay launcher started to launch, and I was able to play the games once, and then the problem returned. Now, I can open the uplay launcher, but can't launch any games.Going Offline: I've read in some internet forums that going offline could help me. I tried. Nothing.Update: Tried running all as administrator, didn't work.I don't have anymore ideas. I don't think that this is an installation problem because I was able to play the games, the problem appeared out of nowhere.Here are my device's specifications:Windows 10AMD FX Quad-Core ProcessorNVIDIA GForce GT6808GB of RAM. UPDATEI don't know what happened. I didn't did anything, but today i just tried to start the games and they worked. It seems that uplay is pretty unstable. However, i'll leave the question (and bounty) open, if someone appears with a permanent solution (i don't know how long my games will be working).
