Master’s programs?
Hi everyone!

I’m at a loss right now as to what direction I should go in for grad school. I have a BA in Psychology, and considering going into school psychology. But also considering moving away from this field all entirely, as I want to pursue a more lucrative field. So I’m trying to learn more about what’s out there! 

What type of master programs have you found lead to pretty lucrative careers... or masters you just overall happy that you pursued/are pursing?
