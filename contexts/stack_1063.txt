How do I connect my NextCloud account to Ubuntu using a self-signed certificate? I'm trying to connect my NextCloud account to Ubuntu, so that I can take advantage of the calendar integration and other features. Right now I'm running my own NextCloud server with a self-signed certificate, as I'm trying to avoid relying on any outside authority.I can access the server from my browser without issues, and I don't mind having to go through the 'untrusted' certificate exception dialog since I'm the one who signed it.But when I try to connect my NextCloud account to Ubuntu using the \"Online Accounts\" feature in system Settings, the connection fails with an error message due to \"Invalid Certificate.\"Is there a way to force Ubuntu to accept my NextCloud server and credentials, even if the certificate is invalid? Is there a way to add the certificate so that Ubuntu will accept it and connect to my server?
