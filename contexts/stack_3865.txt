Paired t-test or repeated measurement I am designing RCT in the same patient (treatment on one side of the face and control on the contralateral side of the face)The RCT will be 1 month long with measurements happening at 2 and 4 week postoperatively. I am interested in differences between treatment and control sides at each time follow up.I am not sure whether a simple paired t-test for or a repeated measure ANOVA would be more appropriate.Thankyou
