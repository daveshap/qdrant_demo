SONNY: I want somebody very good, very safe to plant that gun. I don't want my brother coming out of that toilet with just his dick in his hand.
CLEMENZA: The gun will be there.
SONNY: You're on, kid...I'll square it with Mom your not seeing her before you left. And I'll get a message to your girl friend when I think the time is right.
CLEMENZA: We gotta move...
MICHAEL: O.K. How long do you think before I can come back?
SONNY: Probably a year...
HAGEN: Jesus, I don't know...
SONNY: Can you do it Mike?
