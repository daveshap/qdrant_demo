DONNIE: Whoa. That's OK, Dr. Thurman, it's nothing to be embarrassed about. I have sexual fantasies all the time too.
DR. THURMAN: I know.
DONNIE: I mean... Gretchen... She won't even let me kiss her. She says because it's our first kiss... she's, like, waiting for this big... moment or something. I just don't get it. I just want to get it over with so we can move on to the good stuff.
DR. THURMAN: The good stuff.
DONNIE: Yeah... you know... Fucking.
DR. THURMAN: Have you ever made love, Donald?
