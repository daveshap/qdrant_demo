BRET: Trevor what is the metric probability of you getting any work done at all today?
TREVOR: Hey Bret. Christ, my head feels like a split coconut.
BRET: Dude there is a track on the carpet between here and the bathroom. It was made by your ass. You've been dragging it all fucking week. What happened to you yesterday?
TREVOR: Give me a break. I checked back into the hospital- amongst other things.
BRET: Hospital? You haven't been to the hospital since uh...
TREVOR: Since what?
BRET: Look never mind. Just get some numbers going- any numbers at all will due. The hills have eyes remember?
