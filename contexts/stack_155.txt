Install older OSX a dual boot on a computer with OSX High sierra I need to install a secondary OSX, older one, like yosemite or something, on a computer, which has High sierra installed. The problem is it has the crazy APFS file system, which doesn't seem to allow normal partitions (at least the Disk utility doesn't seem to do that) and it also says that it cannot run Yosemite installer, because it's too old for this computer... Any ideas?I'm also trying to download the OSX High sierra installer and the damn App Store is saying \"downloading\but that's it, no clue how far it is or if it is actually downloading...
