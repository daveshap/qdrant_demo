Starting a new job - advice please!
Hi all! I just got offered a job at a large and pretty reputable marketing agency. I had been looking for a job for 7 months prior to getting the offer... So I am pretty relived and excited. They hired me on as an intern with possibility to hire when it’s done. This is my first real job out of school. I have worked a couple other internships at companies I wasn’t too excited about and wasn’t really the area I was looking for.

I’m seeking some advice and tips on starting a new gig. How do you keep yourself organized when starting a new job. Best advice on making new friends at work? If you can offer me any insight I would really appreciate it! I would like to work really hard at this job to prove myself and hopefully get hired on full time when it’s done. 

Thanks everyone!
