JEZZIE: Jake, is that you?
JACOB: What the hell did you do, move all the furniture?
JEZZIE: Why didn't you turn on the light?
JACOB: I didn't want to wake you.
JEZZIE: Gee, thanks a lot.
JACOB: Where is the lamp?
JEZZIE: Where are you?
JACOB: If I knew I wouldn't have to ask. What did you do? I was happy the way it was.
JEZZIE: I moved the couch. That's all.
JACOB: Where to?
JEZZIE: That help?
JACOB: Thanks.
JEZZIE: What do you think?
JACOB: What do you mean?
JEZZIE: The room!
JACOB: Oh God, Jezzie, ask me tomorrow.
JEZZIE: It is tomorrow. Four A.M. How come you're so late?
JACOB: Roberts didn't show up. What could I say? Besides, it's double time.
JEZZIE: What happened to you?
JACOB: Don't ask.
