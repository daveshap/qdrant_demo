This world is literally just as bad or worse as my depression makes it out to be.
You have to be out of touch with reality to deny what's going on. People say that those with depression see the world with pessimism, but life sucks for everyone. I have no hope for the future, people die all the time in awful ways, it's hard to get out of poverty, it's hard to live with mental health issues. It just seems so much more ethical to stop all of this madness and leave. I want to peace out of this whole thing. I'm going insane being here and it just gets worse all the time.
