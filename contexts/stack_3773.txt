Lack of understanding of LOOCV I am trying to utilize LOOCV in the data partition in R. The idea of LOOCV is to train the model on n-1 set and test the model on the only remaining one set. Then, is to repeat this process n timesNow suppose that I am dealing with KNN. That means on each repetition of LOOCV, I will get the Confusion Matrix to assess my model, which I want.Since the dimension of my dataset is (569) (32). It means by using LOOCV, I will have 569 the confusion matrix as a total. The reason for calculating the confusion matrix is to find the number of correct class.Am I right or I have something wrong? If I am right. How to assess the model?
