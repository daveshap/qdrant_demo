DENNIS: I mean, if I went around saying I was an Emperor because some moistened bint had lobbed a scimitar at me, people would put me away!

DENNIS: Ah! NOW ... we see the violence inherent in the system.
ARTHUR: Shut up!
DENNIS: Come and see the violence inherent in the system. Help, help, I'm being repressed!
ARTHUR: Bloody peasant!
DENNIS: Oh, Did you hear that! What a give-away.
ARTHUR: Come on, patsy.
