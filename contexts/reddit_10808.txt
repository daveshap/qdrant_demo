Warning:  "Suicide methods" PM Troll is active at SW.  

##Edit:  June 11, 2012:  We're getting reports of reddit user loosepanda22 sending PMs inviting people to his pro-suicide subreddit.  Please report any occurrences to us using the link at right.  Thanks!##

If you get a PM that looks "official", encourages you to avoid suicide hotlines, and links to "painless" suicide methods, please use the link at right or **[click here to message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch)**.  Please **include the reddit account** that the PM came from.  

This person is trying to undermine our mission by **randomly and indiscriminately** targeting our OPs with PMs that appear to come from us at SW,  sound compassionate, and seem factual on the surface.  Their true goal is to make suicide seem safe and painless, and make seeking help seem difficult and dangerous.

**If you get one of these PMs, remember that the troll has no interest in helping you.       
He's** ***using you*** **to target /r/SuicideWatch.**

Despite what the PMs claim, please be assured of the following:

* The SW moderators truly cannot trace the source of any post.  We more than anyone else desperately wish we could sometimes.   The troll claims that this has happened in the past, but in all cases the OPs were either located by the resourceful use of standard internet search methods, or were traced by someone other than the SW moderators.

* Calls to suicide hotlines do not regularly result in involuntary psych holds and expensive ambulance bills.   It's possible, but it's rare and is  unlikely unless you are uncooperative with the hotline responders.  The troll claims that a simple admission of suicidal feelings is enough to trigger police intervention and involuntary confinement.  This is completely false.   A rescue will only be initiated when the caller is at *immediate* risk for suicide, and is either unable or unwilling to agree to a safety plan.   Suicide hotlines are the best help that's out there, and they understand that anonymity helps callers feel safe to speak openly.  They only betray confidentiality as an absolute last resort.  

* In almost all jurisdictions, the doctrine of *informed consent* applies to suicide hotline callers.  That means that callers have a right to know the hotline's policy regarding confidentiality, and their criteria for breaking confidentiality.    Callers are entitled to know this information before they disclose anything.  However, the onus is on the caller to ask the question.  If you're concerned about confidentiality when calling a hotline, you are entitled to ask them what their disclosure policy is before you tell them anything about yourself or answer any questions.  (And it's always best to ask as politely as you can, understanding that you're probably feeling pretty rotten or you wouldn't be calling.)

* The PM claims that you can help your loved ones avoid suffering by killing yourself by one of the "painless" methods.   This is an extremely dirty trick of psychological manipulation, as one of the highest risk factors for suicide is a sense of being a burden.  Please be assured that according to the [actual experts](http://books.google.com/books?id=RSt4hnnKoWkC), the only thing a person struggling with suicidal thoughts can do to significantly reduce their loved ones' suffering is to get some real help.

*  The troll is also subverting the mission and intent of Exit International.  Their Peaceful Pill handbook, which the PM links to, explicitly states that **anyone struggling with depression should not be exposed to this material**.  

It's very important that you report any PMs of this nature.  Please also report and downvote any comments which claim responsibility for the PMs, or defend the troll's actions.
