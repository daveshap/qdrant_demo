QUINT: This is Quint, Missus.
ELLEN'S VOICE: I just wanted to know if you were all right... the Coast Guard let me use their radio. Is Chief Brody there?
QUINT: He's busy.
ELLEN'S VOICE: Well... is everything all right?
QUINT: Just fine, Missus. We'll be back soon. Everything's fine. We haven't seen anything yet. Orca out.
