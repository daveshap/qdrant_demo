BETTY: Get some sleep.
MALCOLM: You have to sleep for three.
MALCOLM: I'm sorry. I haven't been the best husband or father.
BETTY: Shhh!
MALCOLM: Families shouldn't be separated. I'll never make another long trip without you and the kids. We'll all be together.
BETTY: Dear heart, I love you.
MALCOLM: We had the best organization that black people ever had and niggers ruined it.
