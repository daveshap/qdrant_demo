IGOR: If my curiosity is not too great, would you mind telling me what manner of animal this is you are designing?
RALPH: One of the maids-in-waiting for that Elizabethan group.
IGOR: And he isn't struck dead! This man, he lives! It would be interesting to know, young man, where and when you studied anatomy.
RALPH: That doesn't seem so bad to me. What is wrong with it?
IGOR: Everything, my friend. And you hope to be a great sculptor -- A great sculptor. Look -- this forearm is at least two inches too long.
RALPH: But the composition as a whole -- I've tried to keep a sketchy freedom.
IGOR: If it is freedom to represent people with limbs that don't match -- cripples -- you have achieved your purpose. Anatomy! Heaven forgive you. You must have studied with a sideshow of freaks!
