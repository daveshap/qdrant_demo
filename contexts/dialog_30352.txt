SCOTTIE: Judy, it can't make much difference to you. I just want to see how you'd look and I know it won't be the same, but --
JUDY: No, I don't want any clothes! I don't want anything! I want to get out of here!
SCOTTIE: Judy, you've got to do this for me! Please!
SCOTTIE: Yes! That's it!
SALESWOMAN: I thought so!
JUDY: I don't like it!
SCOTTIE: We'll take it! Will it fit?
SALESWOMAN: Oh, yes! It may need some slight alterations, but it is madam's size. All right, dear. We'll have it for you to try in a moment.
SCOTTIE: How soon can it be altered?
SALESWOMAN: Well...
SCOTTIE: Can we have it by tonight?
SALESWOMAN: Well, if it's absolutely necessary...
SCOTTIE: Yes, it is. Now, I want to look at an evening dress, a dinner dress, black -- short -- long sleeves -- with a neck cut this... ...and the skirt out.
