MARK: OUCH that stings! Damn, what am I going to do with my back like this?
FRIDA: Worried about what all your girlfriends might think?
MARK: Frida, you know you're it for me.
FRIDA: Yeah right... You better go.
MARK: Hey wait, I paid three bucks for that burger. You owe me...
FRIDA: You haven't even paid me back the thousand bucks you owe me!
MARK: I'm working on it...
FRIDA: Why did Gregory ask me out? I mean he's cute -- he probably just wants to pitch his screenplay idea.
JENNIFER: Maybe he likes you, ever think of that? It's good for you to go out -- get your mind off Mark.
FRIDA: You're so lucky you have George and don't need to go on dates anymore.
JENNIFER: What I really hated about dating was the lines guys used to get into my apartment. Can I use your phone?" "How about a nightcap?" "I want to meet your cat." And my all-time favorite
FRIDA: Maybe they have to pee.
JENNIFER: Are you kidding? He might as well say, Can I date rape you?""
FRIDA: I never thought of it like that. I never know what to do on dates. Do guys still pay?
JENNIFER: They better. Of course, trouble is, you never know what they'll expect for it. You gotta know what to order, and what you're willing to do. Like if a guy spends a fortune on you, he's gonna feel like you owe him something.
