It never hurts to ask....even if you don't know you are asking.
I am trying to make my home more energy efficient and had looked into having foam insulation blown into my attic. I had a couple of estimates but they were out of my budget. (House built in 1952, literally no insulation in my attic, just dust) I was looking on my city's website and saw that they offered a weatherization program for low income families. I printed off everything, filled out the forms, made copies of the required information (i.e.: ID, birth certificate, utility bills) and mailed it last week. 

I just got a call from the city and the lady I spoke with said she had received my application and asked if I was just needing help with my electric bill. I explained that my bill isn't high, yet....summer is coming and this is Texas....lol, but that I was actually trying to get assistance for having insulation blown in my attic and just weatherizing my house in general. She said that she saw that I signed that form and that she would be sending it to that department as well....but, that I would also receive assistance with my electric bill and they would send me a letter to let me know what months they will pay and how much they will help pay!!!! 

I was BLOWN away....I had to confirm with her that not only was someone from the electric company going to come out and do an energy review for weatherization but that I was ALSO going to receive some help with my electric bill!!
She said yes and also wanted to let me know that the weatherization appointments can be as long as 8 months out because of how backed up they are. I told her I understood and thanked her profusely.

Just wanted to put this out there for people. I've been in my house for almost 20 years and had no idea that this program existed in my city. :)
