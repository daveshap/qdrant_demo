BOND: Two. Shaken not stirred.
BOND: What the hell are you doing here?
ELEKTRA: Someone wants to kill me, I’d rather die looking him straight in the eye. What are you doing here? Looking for a woman a little more your type? How about that one?
BOND: If this little show is for my benefit, I’ll take you home right now.
ELEKTRA: You had your chance, James. Now I’m looking for a bigger thrill.
