BOSS MAN: Jesus Christ on the cross... Someone make sense.
HEROINE: Easy. We're surrounded by something the likes none of you have ever seen before. Some kind of animals. Real fast, volatile, predators. ONE went through three of your patrons like they were Kleenex.
BOSS MAN: So, your dead hubby shot me twice, three of my customers have been eaten, and there are angry creatures outside?
HEROINE: He only shot you once.
BOSS MAN: Huh?
HEROINE: He shot you the other time.
