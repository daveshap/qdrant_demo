Had anxiety about going to the post office to ship a package, forced myself to go and realized anxiety just makes everything sound worse than it really is and I’m proud of myself for going!
I know this sounds so like something so basic but lately my anxiety has been really bad preventing me from doing things 

I had to ship an item that someone bought off me online and I kept putting it off this week because I was too anxious to go to the post office and wasn’t sure what I would do once I got there.

My boyfriend told me that I should try to go because this was something I needed to do since I already got paid for the item. Sometimes all you need is some support from one person to tell you that you’ll be fine about a certain situation

Once I got back I felt so relieved, it was something so easy to do and I was just overthinking it and making myself more anxious but in reality there was nothing to be anxious about! 

I just personally felt proud of myself and wanted to write this in case anyone has been dealing with similar anxiety, we always tend to make out situations to be worse than they actually are, and you won’t know the outcome and that most of the time your anxiety is wrong unless you try!
