Lost my job and my gf broke with me
I'm destroyed. A couple days ago i lost my job because covid and a few hours ago my gf broke up with me, because she says that she doesnt love me like before since a time and now she realized it.

I don't know what to do, i suffered depression before and i know that if i fall again i'll won't stand up again
