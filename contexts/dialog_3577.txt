JOHN: Oh, I don't know. In my job as Deputy Assistant of New Business at the bank would have to listen to the problems of a great many individuals. This took a lot of understanding and sympathy, to try to work out solutions to their problems. But, you see, I'm not in that line of work anymore. Nowadays I'm a bank robber.
NADIA: You don't understand anything.
JOHN: I think that about covers it. I think I have grasped the part about you being dumped though. That's got to hurt, I imagine. That's got to smart a bit. I mean strictly in my observer's capacity it seemed you two were getting on Pretty Fucking Famously.
JOHN: Unless. Unless this is part of the routine. You get tied up, stick around, distract me, they both bust in and Steal My Cup Of Coffee.
NADIA: It's makes it easier. Okay.
JOHN: I don't want to know.
NADIA: It makes it faster. If I don't speak to the men, they fall faster. It's pretty obvious why.
JOHN: That's a relief. It's nice to know I'm a regular guy.
NADIA: So what are you going to do?
JOHN: I'm going to drink my coffee. Then, we're going to the police station. Where there will be lawyers, loss of job, house, humiliation, gutter press, and probably prison.
NADIA: They don't blame you. When a bank employee does this they understand. You get your life back. Anyway I bet you hated that bank.
JOHN: Even so I always felt the decision to burst in and rob it very much remained with me.
NADIA: Why else would you send off for me? If you just wanted sex just go to a prostitute.
JOHN: Well as it turns out I did.
