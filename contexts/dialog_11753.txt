DIANE: Mm-mm. I never knew him. He died before Frank and I met. This here's... Frank and Tom's mother and father... there's little Frank and Tom...
ANNIE: She calls him Tommy...
DIANE: Always did. I think she favored him a little. You tend to when you have more than one, even though you love 'em all the same.
DIANE: Ha, she loves telling this story about how when he was two years old, he ran off. They found him in the barn, sleeping between two giant hooves of a Percheron stallion. She said that horse was protecting him and nobody could convince her otherwise.
ANNIE: I got a little confused though. The ranch Ellen was talking about -- that's not this one?
