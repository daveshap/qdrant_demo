FREDDY: Oh, do you like it? I'm not partial to desserts, but this is excellent.
IGOR: Who are you talking to?
FREDDY: To you! You just made a 'yummy' sound, so I thought you liked the dessert.
IGOR: I didn't make a 'yummy' sound -- I just asked what it was.
FREDDY: But you did -- I just heard it.
IGOR: It wasn't me.
INGA: It wasn't me.
FREDDY: Look here - if it wasn't you, and it wasn't you, and it wasn't me...
MONSTER: MMMMMMMMMMMMMNNNNNNmmmmmmmm?!?
FREDDY: It's alive!
INGA: Oh, Doctor!
INGA: I think you've done it, master.
FREDDY: Alive! Look at it. I have defeated death!
IGOR: Better not get too close, master. This guy could kill you.
FREDDY: I suppose you're right. Inga! Prepare a sedative, just in case.
FREDDY: It's trying to talk. it wants us to take off the straps.
IGOR: Don't fall for that one.
FREDDY: But don't you see...the brain of Hans Delbruck is inside this grotesque hulk -- pleading with us. I've got to untie it.
IGOR: careful, master -- you never can tell with these chaps.
