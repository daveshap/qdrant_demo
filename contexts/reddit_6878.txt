Is it smart for the boss to fire someone simply because they believe someone isn’t happy?
What would your boss think if they’re told you’re not happy with your salary and will be gone within a year? (They are unable to give you more because of the economic decline during the coronavirus)

Would they...:
1. Fire you the first chance they get
2. Resent you but not do anything 
3. Nothing will happen- they don’t care how you feel
4. Give you more money to try to keep you
5. Push you out
6. Not believe what they hear 100%
