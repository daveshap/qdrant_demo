SUSAN: A chicken?
KANE: No. But you're close.
SUSAN: A rooster?
KANE: You're getting farther away all the time. It's a duck.
SUSAN: Excuse me, Mr. Kane. I know this takes a lot of nerve, but - who are you? I mean - I'm pretty ignorant, I guess you caught on to that -
KANE: You really don't know who I am?
SUSAN: No. That is, I bet it turns out I've heard your name a million times, only you know how it is -
KANE: But you like me, don't you? Even though you don't know who I am?
SUSAN: You've been wonderful! I can't tell you how glad I am you're here, I don't know many people and -
KANE: And I know too many people. Obviously, we're both lonely. Would you like to know where I was going tonight - when you ran into me and ruined my Sunday clothes?
SUSAN: I didn't run into you and I bet they're not your Sunday clothes. You've probably got a lot of clothes.
KANE: I was only joking! This evening I was on my way to the Western Manhattan Warehouses - in search of my youth.
