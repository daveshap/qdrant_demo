How do i include the current pandemic into my thesis? and where?
Hello,

i am currently writing my bachelor thesis. APA Style. 

I read that its important that i give a context to extreme situations that could influence my study. Since i am researching relationships the corona pandemic should be important. 

Under which part in my bachelorthesis am i supposed to describe the pandemic and it influences on my study? 

&#x200B;

Does it belong into the method part or do i only mention it in the discussion?
