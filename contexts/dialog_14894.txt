FERRIE: You know damn well who it is.
LOU: Dave?
FERRIE: Yeah, you got it. Since you're the only straight shooter in that fuckin' office, I'd like an answer from you. Did you plant it?
LOU: Dave, do you think we're out of our minds? The whole building's been a zoo since that broke. We can't get a thing done. Reporters crawling everywhere. You think we want that?
FERRIE: Somebody planted that fucking story! And somebody tipped off the press I'm one of Garrison's fucking suspects. I can't go home. I'm out on the street. The maggots are everywhere! Do you know what you've done to me? It's all over the national news now. You know what you've done to me?
LOU: Calm down, Dave, what?
FERRIE: I'm a dead man! From here on, believe me, I'm a dead man.
LOU: What are you talking about, Dave? You weren't mentioned in the story. Don't jump to conclusions.
FERRIE: You think your investigation's been all that secret? You know, when you talk to people, they talk to other people.
LOU: What did they...
FERRIE: You still questioning any Cubans?
LOU: Dave, you know that's where this road leads.
FERRIE: It leads farther than that.
LOU: Dave, just calm down. Meet me in the lobby of the Fontainbleau in 20 minutes. I'll have a suite reserved for you under an assumed name.
FERRIE: The Fontainbleau? 20 minutes?
LOU: Yeah. Come on, Dave, come on our side. I guarantee you the boss'll protect you... Dave?
FERRIE: ...give me protection?
LOU: Yeah! He'd kill for you Dave. He likes you. Your mind.
FERRIE: I got no place to sleep. I'll meet you in 20 minutes.
