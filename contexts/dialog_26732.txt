MIKE: Charles! What's up, man?
CHARLES: Oh. You know.
MIKE: Did you, um, did you get that pilot?
CHARLES: No, man. I know you didn't get it 'cause you wouldn't've asked me. It wasn't that funny anyway...
MIKE: ...piece of shit. Listen, Charles, this is my friend Rob from Back East.
CHARLES: Hi.
ROB: My pleasure.
MIKE: Charles and me went to network on this pilot together.
ROB: I just tested for one...
MIKE: ...yeah, a month ago.
CHARLES: Oh, I'm sorry. How'd your folks take it?
ROB: I haven't heard an official no" yet."
CHARLES: You haven't told then, huh?
ROB: No.
CHARLES: I still haven't told my folks I didn't get Deepspace 9". You'd think they'd'a figured it out by now
MIKE: ...and boy does it hurt when they ask.
CHARLES: I don't even tell them about anything I'm close on anymore...
MIKE: ...not until you book it...
CHARLES: ...and even then...
MIKE: ...you might get cut out.
ROB: I'm considering taking a job as a Goofy"."
CHARLES: Hey, man. At least it's Disney.
MIKE: You want to come with us to a party at the Chateau Marmont? They got a bungalow and lots of beautiful babies.
CHARLES: Why not? This place is dead anyway.
