My partner self harms in front of me during arguments
Myself (F22) and my partner (M22) have only been dating around 7 months. We have been living together with his family due to the current situation in the U.K.  

Whenever we will get into a disagreement or an argument (or even if I am being quiet because I’m tired or grumpy) they will get very upset and get very stressed. This usually leads to them banging their head off doors or cutting their wrists or hands until they bleed. 

I have no idea how to help them and I am feeling very alone in this. I don’t want to tell my friends or family incase they worry for me. I have discussed this with my partner and they have downloaded some mental health apps on their phone but I know that they won’t stop. I don’t think they know how much this is hurting me and making me feel so low.

EDIT: I used the term ‘they’ when referring to my boyfriend and I don’t really know why, probably because I typed this in a hurry. I’m sorry for any confusion caused. 

EDIT2: I have told my boyfriends mother about what has happened and she has had a very firm talk with him and told him to increase his exercise as a distraction right now and call up a counsellor. I have had a big talk with him about how this is unhealthy and almost toxic, he said he will go to counselling once everything settles down but for now is using mental health apps. I also don’t think he is doing this for attention as he is very embarrassed about it and wears long sleeves and only myself, his close family and friends know. He understands this is not healthy and is working to better himself. Thanks everyone for replying and offering advice x
