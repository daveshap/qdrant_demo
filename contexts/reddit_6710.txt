Acceptable forms of contact
I have a question for recruiters. My resume is posted on several job boards as well as my LinkedIn. I get several calls a week from recruiters about positions that they are trying to fill. I would appreciate if I got an email first with a brief summary of how they found me, the position and industry of the job they have in mind, and asking to schedule a time to talk. Some of the opportunities they call about are not relevant to my skills/experience/career interests and it would save my time, as well as theirs if I could simply respond to an email stating that the position is not a good fit. My question is, what is a professional way to convey to recruiters that I wish to be contacted by email first?
