New Job, some concerning policies
Hey all.


Started a new job recently. It's working for a community action group (don't want to say the name, its a small-ish company)

So, the job includes door knocking on high rise, generally low income apartment buildings to talk to residents, which is fine. 

However I was led to believe that this was being done in pairs (it is not)

So for 5 hours a day, I'm alone and being explicitly told my first goal is to 'Get in the Door' of strangers apartments (with quotas). Am I right to be concerned about safety, particularly as a woman? 

I was told there was alot of training, but after about two hours of some situational bits yesterday, I started door knocking, alone. 

Other 'yellow flags' include:

-There is no contract, or clear definition of the role. 

-Pay is ambiguous "it's salaried, works out to 15 an hour" but I haven't seen that in writing anywhere, and 32k-something works out to under 15 an hour (what they pay part time workers) 

- I'm worried about the cops being called on me for soliciting in a building. We don't have permission to be in there, and are instructed to just follow a resident when they open the main door. I asked the main organizer if they had ever been arrested or had the the cops called on him while doing the job, and the question wasn't answered. (Particularly anyone with Ontario Law knowledge know the answer to this one?)

- I would learn to deal with this one, but basically the hours are different than advertised. 12-9pm, with some weekends. (I have a much better paying weekend job, with a contract) 

-It is a preformance based job with quotas. (Re they can fire me if I don't meet those quotas) I have worked with quotas before. But I've know what was expected and what was the threshold I needed to meet. That's not the case here, after asking multiple times. 

-Women who work mobile jobs- how do you use the bathroom, or change tampons? These buildings aren't always around a coffee shop or Macdonald, and we aren't technically allowed to leave the building incase we can't get back in. 

Really I'm thankful to have something full-time after 4 months of apply and just scrapping by on other gigs, but the above really worry me. 

Thoughts? Has anyone had a job like this before?
