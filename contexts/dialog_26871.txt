BETSY: We've signed up 15,000 Palantine volunteers in New York so far. The organizational problems are becoming just staggering.
TRAVIS: I know what you mean. I've got the same problems. I just can't get things organized. Little things, I mean. Like my room, my possessions. I should get one of those signs that says, One of these days I'm gonna get organezizied""
BETSY: Travis, I never ever met anybody like you before.
TRAVIS: I can believe that.
BETSY: Where do you live?
TRAVIS: Oh, uptown. You know. Some joint. It ain't much.
BETSY: So why did you decide to drive a taxi at night?
TRAVIS: I had a regular job for a while, days. You know, doin' this, doin' that. But I didn't have anything to do at night. I got kinda lonely, you know, just wandering around. So I decided to works nights. It ain't good to be alone, you know.
BETSY: After this job, I'm looking forward to being alone for a while.
TRAVIS: Yeah, well... In a cab you get to meet people. You meet lotsa people. It's good for you.
BETSY: What kind of people?
TRAVIS: Just people people, you know. Just people. Had a dead man once.
BETSY: Really?
TRAVIS: He'd been shot. I didn't know that. He just crawled into the back seat, said West 45th Street" and conked out."
BETSY: What did you do?
TRAVIS: I shut the meter off, for one thing. I knew I wasn't going to get paid. Then I dropped him off at the cop shop. They took him.
BETSY: That's really something.
TRAVIS: Oh, you see lots of freaky stuff in a cab. Especially when the moon's out.
BETSY: The moon?
TRAVIS: The full moon. One night I had three or four weirdos in a row and I looked up and, sure enough, there it was -- the full moon.
