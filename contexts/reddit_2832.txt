I recently applied for a job that requested salary expectations before the interview, and they just emailed me asking if I were flexible with that number... I made a mistake and I see it now, how do I correct it?
NikiI received an email earlier today, as the title suggests. It goes something like this:

>Hi toxic_badgers,

>We are very interested in your resume. Before we continue conversations, I always like to make sure that we are on the same page as far as annual salary is concerned. When you applied, you indicated a salary expectation, yet I wanted to know if there was any flexibility there. (some other unimportant information follows.) blah blah blah, thank you.

My problem is that I honestly low-balled my self and only submitted an expectation like... 2000 dollars more than what I make now...because I didn't expect them to be interested in me... and I am willing to laterally move as far as pay because it moves me somewhere, with a title increase and there is upward mobility (unlike my current position)... But I would prefer not to have to make the same or less money. What would be the best way to approach this?

Edit: i responded with a comment from below and they told me they could not afford me.
