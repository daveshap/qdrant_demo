LUCAS: Too much sun.
WALTER: What?
LUCAS: Your ivy. Too much direct sunlight. These plants don't like a lot of sun.
WALTER: They grow outside, don't they?
LUCAS: Sure they do. But outside they've got trees around them. The trees shade them from the sun. Of course, the plants enrich the soil around the trees. One of nature's symbiotic relationships.
WALTER: You going to take me on a nature walk?
LUCAS: Don't be witty. Yesterday you took the number twelve bus from work, but instead of getting off at your normal stop, for some reason you stayed on. Why did you stay on the bus, Walter?
WALTER: I fell asleep.
