GASTON: Madame Colet, I think you deserve a scolding. First, you lose your bag--
MARIETTE: Then I mislay my checkbook--
GASTON: Then you use the wrong lipstick--
MARIETTE: And how I handle my <u>money</u>!
GASTON: It's disgraceful!
MARIETTE: Tell me, M'sieu Laval, what else is wrong?
GASTON: Everything! ... Madame Colet, if I were your father-- which, fortunately, I am not--
MARIETTE: Ye-es?
GASTON: And you made any attempt to handle your own business affairs, I would give you a good spanking--in a business way, of course.
MARIETTE: What would you do if you were my <u>secretary</u>?
GASTON: The same thing.
MARIETTE: You're hired!
