On standby and just found job listing for my position
I've been on standby since the start of March. I don't mind it, I'm actually making more on unemployment then I usually earn (thanks to behind grossly underpaid for my field). But that's okay, I like my job!

I checked in with my employer yesterday to see if I can return to work, part time, later this month. I was told it's uncertain, things are slow. I told them not to worry, I'm doing fine, I hope things look up! I have been promised several times that I will have a job when this is over, "no matter what." 

Today I found a job listing from my company for my position. They are trying to hire someone to do my job, with a year experience mind you, for $12.25/hr... I guess no one told them minimum wage in my state is $13.50. I make 14 bucks an hour. 

I feel like sending a friendly text that says " FYI, minimum wage is $13.50! :-)" but really I'm offended and hurt. I could have found a better paying job a year ago, but I *liked* working here. I chose familiarity and what I perceived to be appreciation, over money. But I guess they decided I was too expensive. 

Not sure how to approach them about this, or if I should act like I never saw it and just aggressively jump into a search for a new job. It's a very small company (less than 5 people) so this really hurts me on a personal level. I felt like these guys were my friends. 

 Advice?
