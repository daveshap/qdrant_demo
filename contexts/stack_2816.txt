If you make an effort to escape a black hole, would your free fall velocity be slowing down? If you make an effort to escape a black hole, would your free fall velocity be slowing down? It is known that you can't escape once you passed event horizon. But is it possible to slow down? Or should I make a sample numbers. The escape velocity where you stand is $1,5 c$, your free fall speed at the moment is $0,75 c$. If the pilot start to begin escape attempt with $0,6 c$ in the normal world, how much is the free fall speed now? Or perhaps instead of slowing down, the free fall become faster now, because it turns out that there is only one direction in the black hole??
