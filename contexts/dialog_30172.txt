KOVASH: &lt;&lt;It was smaller than that. Sharper.&gt;&gt;
BODI: + The nose is sharper. Smaller too. + &lt;&lt;And what about the hair? You said something earlier about it.&gt;&gt;
KOVASH: &lt;&lt;It is longer than that. And not so dark. &gt;&gt;
BODI: &lt;&lt;Are you sure?&gt;&gt;
KOVASH: &lt;&lt;Don't be stupid.&gt;&gt;
BODI: He says the hair is longer and lighter.
VERBAL: That was how I ended up in a barber shop quartet in Skokie, Illinois.
KUJAN: This is totally irrelevant.
VERBAL: Oh, but it's not. If I hadn't been nailed in Illinois for running a three card monte in between sets, I never would have took off for New York. I never would have met Keaton, see. That barber shop quartet was the reason for everything.
KUJAN: Can we just get back to Kobayashi?
VERBAL: The quartet is part of the bit about Kobayashi. The quartet was in my file, along with every other thing I had done since high school, see? Aliases, middle- men. They knew me better than I did. They knew all of us.
KUJAN: You're stalling, Verbal.
VERBAL: Give a guy a break, huh?
KUJAN: What happened?
