I was rejected from a position that required a high school diploma when I have a bachelor's. How am I supposed to properly handle how pathetic I feel right now?
There was a lab job I applied for that only required a high school diploma and practically no experience was required. Being that I have a bachelor's degree and some lab experience, I figured I might have a shot. Turns out my application was about as worthless as a used candy wrapper.

I was sent a rejection email within a few days saying how I wasn't a "good fit" and how they decided to move on with another candidate (probably the hiring manager's friend/family member). I feel like absolute garbage right now. Even jobs with the most basic requirements don't want anything to do with me. I keep getting told to stay positive and keep tricking through, but how am I supposed to keep going when I have all of these rejections and failures punching me in the stomach and kicking me while I'm down.

I hate job hunting so much. The whole process is stupid and I wish it wouldn't be so stressful. I feel incredibly pathetic and I don't know what to do about it.
