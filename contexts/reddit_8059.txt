Is My Covered Tuition Considered Income?
Hello everyone. I am pursuing a PhD and my department covers tuition and pays me a $25000 yearly stipend. Does the tuition being covered (15k a year) count as income? I am looking to refinance some student loans and 40k would increase my chances of approval. If this has been answered before could you point me in the right direction? Thank you.
