Should I accept a job offer where I can make a years salary in 75 days?
Some background information - I’m 19 years old currently work on night crew at a grocery store making $12.20 an hour and make around $25,000 a year. I still live with my parents and am saving up to try and get my own place and eventually want to acquire some rental properties. At the rate I am currently making money it just isn’t cutting it and I need something to speed up the process. 

I was recently offered a position on a fishing trawler boat as a processor where I stand to make $30,000 for 75 days of work. I’d be working 16 and a half hour days, 7 days a week. I have never worked nearly that hard in my entire life it’s hard for me to imagine that kind of work. 

Financially, the smartest thing to do would be accept the position and just try to muscle out those 75 days, but I’m just not sure if I am capable. I want to do the job but it’s hard to imagine myself working 16 hour days when I struggle some days just working 8. Yet another part of me wants to push myself and if I were finish those 75 days it would launch me so much further financially. I know if I can just suffer through that time it would be a big step in my life. I’m just not sure what to do and would appreciate any advice
