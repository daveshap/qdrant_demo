I tried to kill myself.
Not today, not yesterday, 9 years ago. No one knows. No one noticed. I took a bunch of pills out of various bottles my family had lying around. Adderal, percocet, sleeping pills, and allergy meds were among them. I don’t know what else. There were more than four bottles. It was just whatever I could find. I swallowed some of each, chasing them with a wine cooler. Let a few dissolve on my tongue because I liked the sickening feeling they induced. I thought that would be enough. After a few minutes of nothing happening, I swallowed more. Got dizzy. Struggled to make it to the couch. Passed out. I was passed out in the living room and my family didn’t notice. They walked by me and didn’t notice. I still remember it all vividly and think of it often. I had no regrets. I wanted to die. Waking up, realizing I was still alive, that was the worst feeling I’ve ever felt. It put me in a daze. I’ve felt on pause ever since. I often regret not dying. I feel like I should be dead. I feel like a large part of me did die that day. The only reason I didn’t immediately try again was fear of not fully dying. I knew I couldn’t go through that again and didn’t have other resources I felt were adequate. I dropped out of school shortly after. I stopped leaving my house. I see all these stories of people living and being ecstatic over it. I don’t have that. Life hasn’t gotten better. I just wanted to tell someone.
