MRS. PILLETTI: Hey, I come home from your house last night, Marty was here with a girl.
CATHERINE: Who?
MRS. PILLETTI: Marty.
CATHERINE: Your son Marty?
MRS. PILLETTI: Well, what Marty you think is gonna be here in this house with a girl?
CATHERINE: Were the lights on?
MRS. PILLETTI: Oh sure. This girl is a college graduate.
CATHERINE: They're the worst. College girls are one step from the streets. They smoke like men inna saloon. My son Joseph, his wife, you know, she types onna typewriter. One step from the streets, I tell you. Mrs. Pilletti ponders this philosophy for a moment.
MRS. PILLETTI: That's the first time Marty ever brought a girl to this house. She seems like a nice girl. I think he has a feeling for this girl. You heard him sing. He been singing like that all morning.
CATHERINE: Well, that's all. You will see. Today, tomorrow, inna week, he's gonna say to you, Hey
MRS. PILLETTI: I don't sell this house, I tell you that. This is my husband's house. I had six children in this house.
CATHERINE: You will see. A coupla months, you gonna be an old lady, sleeping onna couch in her daughter-in-law's house.
MRS. PILLETTI: Catherine, you are a blanket of gloom. Wherever you are, the rain follows. Someday, you gonna smile, and we gonna declare a holiday.
MARTY: Hello, Ma, waddaya say, it's getting a little late.
MRS. PILLETTI: Sure.
