ELAINE: What's so funny?
RACHEL: Fred. The way he looked when you screamed at him.
ELAINE: God, Fred...
RACHEL: At home you'd never hear a woman scream at a man that way.
ELAINE: No? Why not?
RACHEL: You just wouldn't. It's not the Amish way. But I think it would have done me good if I could have screamed at your brother last night.
ELAINE: Listen, I don't know what's going on or how you got mixed up with him, but don't you let that self-righteous son of a bitch push you around, okay?
