TOM: I'd really like to see you.
LINNEA: Or course. You should come over to the house. The boys would love to meet you.
TOM: That's not quite what I had in mind.
LINNEA: Well...How have you been?
TOM: Well, they removed my heart last week, but I'm doing fine except my nose fell off. Looks a little funny.
