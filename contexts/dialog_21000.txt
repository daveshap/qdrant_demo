O'BRIEN: What's that?
SUSAN: It's a crime fighting costume, what do you think? It's underwear, so if you lose your clothes you'll still be decent.
O'BRIEN: That's going to fit me?
SUSAN: Like a glove.
O'BRIEN: You made this out of my hair?
SUSAN: Sort of. We used a process similar to the vulcanization of rubber and added bulk with a chain of chloroprene elastomers.
