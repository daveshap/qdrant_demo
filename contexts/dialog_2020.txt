CAROL: What? Please? Now? Tell me?!
DR. BETTES: Mrs. Connelly. I'm Martin Bettes ... Dr. Bettes.
CAROL: Not your name... what are you telling me your name for!! Where is he?
DR. BETTES: He's in the bathroom... He's fine.
CAROL: Tell me how bad it is. I let him go out last night when it was so cool without an overshirt -- just and underone with just the straps and I know better... and I let him talk me into it. He was whining and... you don't need this. Give me a second to catch hold.
SPENCER: Hi... Did you know there are doctors who come to your house?
CAROL: No, I didn't. So why are you h...
BEVERLY: I didn't know you had a secret admire.
CAROL: Huh?
BEVERLY: You met the gift.
SPENCER: He's good... And I'm an expert on doctors.
CAROL: Stay out of this... Doctor?
DR. BETTES: My wife is Melvin Udall's publisher. She says I have to take great care of this guy because you're urgently needed back at work. What work do you do?
CAROL: I'm a waitress.
