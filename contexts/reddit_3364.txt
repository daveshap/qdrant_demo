Is this r/dating or r/Rant?
Jesus. What is wrong with this subreddit? All the time I see posts about OLD, how men want only sex, how women have it easy on OLD, how unhappy you are that you are single.. will you cut it out?

No, posting here for the 1001th that ghosting sucks will not make people stop ghosting. Its part of the package of OLD and it will never stop. EVER. Same goes for hookups and ego boosters.

Here's one tip of advice for you: If you are not ready to be ghosted or have people wanting only sex, then you are not ready to use OLD. It is ok to not use OLD. But if you want to play the game, those are part of it.

Also, honest piece of advice for so many people here complaining that they are so unhappy single. If you are unhappy alone, chances are you will be unhappy with someone too. Your happiness is not the responsibility of anyone else but yourself. Get your shit together instead of hoping someone will fix you.
