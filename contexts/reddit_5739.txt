I got fired from my office job today
Last month I wrote this [thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/br9q07/i_feel_like_a_broken_adult_because_i_cant/) caterwauling about how much I hated my office job. Today I was officially let go due to unsatisfactory performance.

Remember that scene from *The Office* where Jan gets fired and is stuck between trying to be elated, and unstoppable hysteria? I don't know if that's how I'm feeling right now. Because I *hated* my office job. It was soul-sucking and killing me. Every day I tried to think of positives but as soon as I stepped foot in that building it was like waves of despair and grief breaking down on my neck.

So now without my job I feel free, cliche but like the entire world is my oyster. I have time to do whatever I want. I can get a part-time job and write on the side. I can eat when I want. I can go for runs, I can sit outside on my balcony with a cup of coffee and watch the sunrise! I can take free online courses to better my skillset.

And so I need advice again. Everything right now is incredibly loud and I can' seem to organize my thoughts on what to do. I planned on taking today to just kind of settle down and accept this reality; clean my apartment, prepare lunches for my boyfriend, decide what of my office crap to keep.

Those of you who have been in this position before, what did you do first? What was most important?

Here's some info:

* I currently have about $5,000 in savings. I unfortunately do not receive severance under these circumstances but I get one last $1,000ish paycheck and a cash out of my vacation time which might equal another $1,000ish. My debts are about $1,000 per month.

* I plan on filing for unemployment asap.

* I have a wonderful boyfriend with a stable job, of whom I already owe a substantial amount of money. I don't want to rely on him but I know he will be there for me.

* I think I have a money market fund so at worse I can tap into that.

* I live in a large city rife with opportunity!

So any words of caution, advice, good fortune, are appreciated here. Right now I feel sort of numb. Don't know how tomorrow will be, but this is a sink or swim time in my life. I don't want to return to a 9-5 office job.
