Linear Regression Approach For Trends I'm working on a project with genetics but I think my problem is applicable to general statistics. I want to test frequency (Minor Allele Frequency) of a SNP/variant across 5 age categories to see if there is any change. I am expecting either linear or a 'U' shaped curve if such an association exists. I have about 1000 individuals within each age group and have calculated the allele frequency for each age group (ranging from 0.001-0.5), hence I only have 5 frequencies in total. Now the problem is that I have 2 million variants/SNPs and so I can't plot each SNP to see the trend before I commence the regression. Currently I propose a linear model with Frequency ~ Age to see if there is a linear trend and Frequency ~ Age + I(Age^2) to see if there is a quadratic curve. Then using a likelihood ratio test to see whether the quadratic term is significant and deducing whether there is a curve. My question is whether this is the best approach, statistically speaking?
