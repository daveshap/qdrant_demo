ROSS: You know what, Erin? I got nothing but time here. Why don't you let me do that for you, and you can get your kids some dinner.
ERIN: Ross -- you are an absolute angel.
ED: Fax these to this number, okay?
BRENDA: All of 'em?
ED: All of them.
DONNA: An on-site monitoring well? That means --
ERIN: It was right up on the PG&E property over there.
DONNA: And you say this stuff, this hexavalent chromium -- it's poisonous?
ERIN: Yeah.
DONNA: Well -- then it's gotta be a different than what's in our water, cause ours is okay. The guys from PG&E told me. They sat right in the kitchen and said it was fine.
ERIN: I know. But the toxicologist I been talking to? He gave me a list of problems that can come from hexavalent chromium exposure. And everything you all have is on that list.
DONNA: No. Hunh-uh, see, that's not what the doctor said. He said one's got absolutely nothing to do with the other.
ERIN: Right, but -- didn't you say he was paid by PG&E?
