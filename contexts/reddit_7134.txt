How to get a student placement in IT
So I am on a 4-year bachelor's course in Computer Science and I have finished the first 2.5 years, the other half of the 3rd year is a 6+ month placement in industry. So I am required to get a job for 6 months or more before I can continue on to the 4th year.


I have been looking for and applying to jobs for over a year but no luck. First I was told that what I learned in the university was not enough and I did not simply have the knowledge required for the job.


So I decided  to go full-time learning and I spent months working 8-hours a day, just practicing programming. Taking online courses, making my own projects. After that I finally started getting more interview offers and more positive responses during the interviews. I know a lot of things now (for entry-level positions at least) and I often would correctly answer almost all or all questions I would be asked. However, I was already rejected a dream internship twice simply because they would expect me to possibly stay for a full-time junior position after the internship. However I would like to return to the university to at least finish my bachelor's degree.


Now I can't find any positions that would offer the opportunity to return to the university afterwards. I can RARELY find entry level jobs, graduate jobs, junior jobs, or internships. And if I do, they simply want someone who stays for longer.


What am I supposed to do? This has been going on for over a year. I am incredibly frustrated at this point. I can't carry on with the university, I can't get a job. How does one find a work placement without a mental breakdown along the way?
