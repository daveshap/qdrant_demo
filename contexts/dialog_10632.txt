ALBERT: I didn't know who Doreen was. Thought she was just another bird.
CARTER: Did Eric Pake pull her?
ALBERT: Yes.
CARTER: How?
ALBERT: I dunno. He's got his ways. He knows Margaret.
CARTER: When did you find out?
ALBERT: A couple of weeks back.
CARTER: How?
ALBERT: No choice. I had a visit from somebody.
CARTER: Who?
ALBERT: Cliff Brumby. He'd seen the film. He wanted to meet Doreen.
CARTER: And you told Brumby?
