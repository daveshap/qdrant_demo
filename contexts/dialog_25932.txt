LUKE: It's going to be hard for the kids when I tell them...I'd like you to be there.
JACKIE: To make it easier for them or you?
LUKE: It's a huge moment in their life --
JACKIE: You can't be an 'us' just when you want to. You can't play that card when it's convenient.
LUKE: We...
JACKIE: WE are over.
LUKE: WE'RE still their parents for the next hundred years.
LUKE: You're still going to have to be dealing with me -- with us. We should tell them together.
JACKIE: No. You think this is going to help the kids then you do it. You're on your own.
JACKIE: The great thing about life is that things keep changing.
LUKE: Remember when Mommy and Daddy got divorced?
JACKIE: And we all went through that together?
