In NMS, if I join a random session with my existing save, do I load in where I last logged off? I've been playing NMS on Xbox using the \"Play Game (other players may join your session)\" option.I'm curious to try the \"Join Game (join a session with friends or random explorers)\" option. I'd be joining a random session; not joining with known friends.If I choose the Join Game option with my existing save, will I load in at my last save location? Or will it port me to the random player whose session I've joined?
