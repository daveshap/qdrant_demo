ERIN: If you tell me to relax, I'm gonna kick your fucking head off --
ED: Erin, it's just a meeting.
ERIN: People don't fly down in their own god damn plane for just a meeting" --"
ED: Look, you said you weren't feeling great. I thought you should rest.
ERIN: Bullshit. You'd drag me off my deathbed if it suited you.
ED: Okay, look. It's an important meeting. Kurt thought, if it was just lawyers --
ERIN: Kurt thought? What about you? Do you think anymore?
ED: Look, this is serious now. They're talking serious money --
ERIN: And, what, I'm not serious?
ED: You're emotional. You're erratic. You say any God damn thing that comes into your head. And I'm not saying that's bad. That can be great; that can be a lot of fun --
ERIN: Fun?" Jesus
ED: Okay, now you're making this personal, and it isn't --
ERIN: <u>Not personal</u>? That's my <u>work</u> in there, Ed. My sweat, my labor, my time. If that's not personal, I don't know what is.
ERIN: How dare you take that away from me.
ED: No one's taking anything --
ERIN: Bullshit. You stuck me in Siberia dictating to some God damn steno clerk so you could finish this thing without me. After all I've done for you, that's the thanks I get.
ED: Don't give me that. You've gotten plenty. You've been well-paid; you've gotten lots of perks ...
ERIN: Perks? Jesus -- <u>perks</u>?
