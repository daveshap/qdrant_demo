CHIEF: Ed, your observations have been astute. What's your assessment of this situation?
EXLEY: The public demands justice, sir. This was a full-fledged riot of policemen. Shift the guilt to men whose pensions are secured. Force them to retire. But someone has to swing. Indict, try and convict Stensland and Bud White. Secure them jail time. Feed them to the sharks, sir. Protect yourself; protect the department.
DUDLEY: Stensland's a disgrace. Straight D fitness reports from every C.O. he ever served under. But White is a valuable officer.
EXLEY: White's a mindless thug.
DUDLEY: No, Edmund. He's a man who can answer yes to those questions I ask you from time to time.
CHIEF: I want to know who we give the public in contrast? The department needs role models. Clean-cut, <u>forthright</u> men the public can admire.
EXLEY: I'll testify, sir. I'm not afraid to do what's right.
CHIEF: And I'll promote you. You'll be a lieutenant immediately.
