Should I go to a company’s hiring event after they’ve rejected my application?
A company is having a hiring event two weeks from now but they’ve encouraged to sign their online application for a easier process. I signed their application yesterday and today they said they won’t be moving forward with my application. 

Just wondering if I should still attend the hiring event in order to try again or would that be inappropriate?

Thank you :)
