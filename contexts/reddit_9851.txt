Grad School Advice
I'm looking for a student affairs grad school program, preferable at a large college or university. Right now I am a junior history major at a mid-major college in Illinois well involved in Greek Life, Campus Rec, and Res Life. I would like to work in any of these fields and am beginning to look at grad schools. Is there anyone out there who could give me advice or personal experience on where they went to grad school and how it was? PM me if you want more info.
