ELLEN: Be careful.
BRODY: Here? You gotta be kiddin'.
BRODY: Love ya.
ELLEN: Hey Chief. Bring my cup back.
BRODY: Christine what?
CASSIDY: Worthingsly... Worthington -- no one ever died on me before.
BRODY: You picked her up on the ferry.
CASSIDY: I didn't know her.
BRODY: And nobody else saw her in the water?
CASSIDY: Somebody could've -- I was sort of passed out.
BRODY: Think she might've run out on you?
CASSIDY: Oh, no, sir. I've never had a woman do that. I'm sure she drowned.
BRODY: You from around here?
CASSIDY: No. Cambridge. Harvard. My family's in Tuxedo, New York, though.
BRODY: You here for the summer?
CASSIDY: Some friends and me took a house.
BRODY: What d'you pay for a place just for the summer?
CASSIDY: A thousand apiece, something like that. There's five of us. And we each kick in a hundred a week for beer and cleaning, stuff like that.
BRODY: Pretty stiff.
