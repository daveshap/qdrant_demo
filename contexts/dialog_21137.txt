MITCHELL: I hoped to get enough to cover them before they cleared. I wasn't lucky.
MARGO: You know what would happen to you if I turned these over to the police?
MITCHELL: I have a rough idea.
MARGO: You'd go to jail. For a long term.
MITCHELL: Correct. I couldn't even afford to pay a lawyer to defend me.
MITCHELL: What'll we do about it, Margo?
MARGO: She is much younger than I am. That's something I'm going to have to get used to. Isn't it, Larry? They'll all be much younger than I am. Here. Tear them up.
