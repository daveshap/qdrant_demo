RODERICK: Where's the beauty you promised me?
CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN: It was my joke. I was tired, and did not care to go farther. There's not prettier woman here than that. If she won't suit your fancy, my friend, then you must wait awhile.
RODERICK: Upon my word, sir, I think you have acted very coolly.
CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN: I have acted as I think fit.
RODERICK: Sir, I'm a British officer.
CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN: It's a lie! You're a deserter! You're an impostor, sir; Your lies and folly have confirmed this to me. You pretend to carry dispatches to a general who has been dead these ten months; you have an uncle who is an ambassador and whose name you don't know. Will you join and take the bounty, sir, or will you be given up?
RODERICK: Neither!
