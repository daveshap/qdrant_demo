My SO...
Let me explain. I like her. A lot. She's amazing, kind, beautiful, all that. She's wonderful. But, she recently had an experience where a guy would blackmail her. He said he loved her, he was depressed, claimed she was the only one who could help him. This went on, she got depressed. She cuts now. And MY darling thinks she's doing something similar to me. She doesn't believe me when i compliment her.
**EDIT: Hey guys, here's whats going on. I'm done listening to other people, she's my girl, we'll keep our relationship to ourselves, do what we think is right, and we'll sure as hell not break up because other people tell us to.**
