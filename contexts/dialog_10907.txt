BLONDELL: They take you away to San Clemente Island. Half the guys quit when they come back. Supposed to be just hell-and-a-half.
JORDAN: That's what I hear.
BLONDELL: Can I ask you somethin', lieutenant? How come you're doing this? I mean, we're kinda curious.
JORDAN: Who's we"?"
BLONDELL: Just some of the women.
JORDAN: I don't know if there's any single reason. But my father was Navy. And he had this old-time recruiting poster in his den. It showed a girl trying on a sailor's uniform while saying, Gee
BLONDELL: I've been accused of that wish.
JORDAN: The woman I saw you with...
BLONDELL: Just a friend. We have friends, too, you know.
JORDAN: But are there... I mean, how many...
BLONDELL: More than you'd guess. It's just that we don't hold coffee klatches. If more then three of us get together at any one time, the guys think it's some kind of uprising.
