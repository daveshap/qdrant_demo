If a person tells you they aren’t ready to be exclusive take the cue and start dating around.
I’ve been with a guy for about 5~ months now and even though he is awesome and fun to hang out with (the sex is incredible) he just isn’t ready to be in an exclusive relationship. Not even boyfriend/girlfriend, I’m just asking for him and I to only see each other.

Nope. Not ready. 

So I took the cue and have started dating around while still seeing this main guy. And honestly it has shown me what I like and don’t like.

Went out with one guy. Non communicative and extremely “meme” based. (All he talked about) 
Went out with one girl. Boring as hell with no ambition to change her current situation. (No job. New to the city. Poly but has never kept a relationship over a year) 

Nah not for me. 

So this week I have a date on Friday with a guy and he is taking me into the city for some show and I’m excited for it. We’ve text over the past week and he seems pretty rad. 

But I am still seeing the 5~ month guy. He took me on a date this past weekend and honestly it was so much fun and just normal. But still no exclusivity. 

All in all. Keep your options open while dating. Hell 5~ months guy might change his mind and he might not but either way don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Shop around. Find some really good eggs.
