I don't know why, but I keep thinking about how I'll react when my parents die.
I'm not sure if I'm the only one that does this. I love my parents and my life would be pretty fucked if one of them died. I feel like I would get depressed for the rest of my life. This also happens when I get them mad at me or some shit and I think "What if they die today?" and go apologize. That's nice I guess but then it gets me thinking what I would do when they do die. Or when a friend's parent dies and I think what'd it be like to be him and get sorta depressed.

Wtf brain?
