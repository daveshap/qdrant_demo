ELAINE: Will you take me home now?
BEN: I'm sorry I took you in there.
ELAINE: I think I'd better go home now please.
BEN: But, Elaine --
ELAINE: Where is the car?
BEN: I just want to tell you something.
ELAINE: I want to go home.
BEN: But could I just tell you this one thing?
ELAINE: What?
BEN: This whole idea -- this date and everything. It was my parents' idea. They forced me into it.
ELAINE: Oh -- that's very nice of you to tell me.
BEN: No. What I mean is -- that's why I've been acting this way. I'm not like this. I hate myself like this.
BEN: Listen -- could you stop crying, please?
ELAINE: No, I couldn't.
BEN: But could you try?
ELAINE: No.
