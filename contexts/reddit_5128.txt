Advice on Recovering from 2 Years of Underemployment
Hello everyone,

I have a Bachelor's in Environmental Science and Master's in Climate Science and Solutions. I graduated in December 2017. Since then, I've had two internships in the environmental field since August 2018. An internship with the local government until just a week ago, and an internship with a private company that started this Monday. I've applied to hundreds of jobs in my city in Southern California.  Due to my wife's career, I've only been able to apply for jobs here. My internship hosts in the local government wanted to hire me but were unable to. I've gone to networking events, taken extra classes, and cold called several companies in addition to applications. Can anyone please offer advice? I need serious help and I'm worried it might already be too late to get a full time job. My current internship ends in July and I might have to go back to retail if I don't get something before then.
