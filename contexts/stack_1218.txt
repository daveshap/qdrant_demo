Quorum question for SQL Cluster (Always On) We are looking at setting up an SQL Always On High Availability environment at our organisation.Our organisation has two datacenters of with one much smaller one but this one's being created to create some high availability.At our primary site we are looking at installing three servers and one at the secondary site. These server will then be added to a cluster (and we'll add the DB's in some Availability Groups accross these servers)But here comes the problem. When the primary site is down due to a power outage for example, the whole cluster will be down because the one server doesn't have a majority even with a default quorum. We did also look at adding a quorum to cloud-storage (disk-only quorum setup) but when the internet connection is down (happens sometimes here in Belgium) we also loose the entire cluster.Does anyone have any experience or a solution for this?Thanks in advance!
