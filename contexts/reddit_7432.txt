American vs European PhD research programs
I'm a PhD chemistry student (just started back in October 2019) and I moved from the US to Czechia for my PhD. Something that I was considering when I made that decision, and which keeps coming to mind now, is the difference in program set-up between PhD study in the US and in Europe. I also had an offer at an American university, and when I thought about that program, I felt confident because I knew exactly how my five years there would look - how many courses I would be taking, what my qualifying exams would entail, etc - whereas here, the PhD system is much more independent. I'll be doing a handful of courses towards the end goal of passing a state exam on 'Inorganic Chemistry' (as broad a topic as that is), and my courses are \*much\* more independent than what I've done in the past. Plus, what with coronavirus and all, exams for this semester have been postponed and I just get more and more nervous about the oral exams I'll be doing for two courses when exams do take place for this term. 

I'm wondering whether anyone else has had a similar experience in transitioning to the European PhD study system, and I'm also looking for advice I suppose, on maintaining my self-motivation to study on my own, and to in fact spend time studying, rather than doing what I would prefer to, which is 40+hrs a week of hands-on lab research. (The last time I did such an independent study course was back in high school when I was 17 and it did \*not\* go well...) Also, any thoughts on oral exams would be greatly appreciated - we never used those back at my university for my BS or MSc.
