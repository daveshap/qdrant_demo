FRANCES: That's me, Clifford.
ODETS: I know, but I'm not seeing it. It's there, Frances, the fire is there, but it's not coming through. You're lazy --
FRANCES: I'm not!
ODETS: Yes, you win them, you bring them into your heart, touch them, but you don't set them on fire!
FRANCES: But I want to. I'm trying!
ODETS: I need an incendiary! An arsonist!
FRANCES: Then show me! That's what I'm here for, to learn, to grow!
ODETS: Good. Then it's very simple. You have to stop being afraid, Frances. It's in you.
