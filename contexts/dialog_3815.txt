BLADE: How could you be a part of this?
VANESSA: These are my people now. I'm one of them.
BLADE: You don't have to be.
VANESSA: You don't understand. I've killed, I've hunted, and I've enjoyed it.
VANESSA: I wish you could see the world as I do. Deacon opened my eyes. There's no turning back from that.
BLADE: I don't believe that.
VANESSA: You will. Time is on our side. Sooner or later, the Thirst always wins.
