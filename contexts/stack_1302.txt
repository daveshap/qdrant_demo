Is \"unstructural plywood\" suitable for shelving carrying a microwave oven? I want to put up a shelf for a microwave, which I guess weighs around 10 kg.In the UK plywood is marketed as either \"structural\" or \"unstructural\".  Is \"unstructural\" a good choice for this application, or should I use structural plywood?The microwave is I'd say typical microwave size in the UK: about 48 cm side by 36 cm deep.  The shelf will be the size of the microwave.  I'm guessing I'd use 18 mm thick ply, but I imagine that might depend on the type of ply.The shelf will be supported by two metal brackets (which have bracing struts that form a triangle).  The brackets will be positioned at or within a cm or two from the location of the feet on which the microwave stands, so as to minimize the bending moment on the shelf.
