DR. EVIL: Scott my boy, come here. How was your day?
SCOTT EVIL: Well, me and a buddy went to the video arcade in town and, like, they don't speak English right, and so my buddy gets into a fight, and he goes 'hey, quit hassling me cause I don't speak French or whatever', and the other guy goes something in Paris talk, and I go 'um, just back off' and he goes 'get out' and I go 'make me'.
DR. EVIL: Fascinating. What are your plans for this evening?
SCOTT EVIL: Thought I'd stay in. There's a good tittie movie on Skinemax.
DR. EVIL: And that's how you want to live your life, is it?
SCOTT EVIL: Yeah. What?
DR. EVIL: Scott, I want you to meet Daddy's nemesis, Austin Powers.
SCOTT EVIL: Why are you feeding him? Why don't you just kill him?
DR. EVIL: In due time.
SCOTT EVIL: But what if he escapes? Why don't you just shoot him? What are you waiting for?
DR. EVIL: I have a better idea. I'm going to put him in an easily-escapable situation involving an overly- elaborate and exotic death.
SCOTT EVIL: Why don't you just shoot him now? Here, I'll get a gun. We'll just shoot him. Bang! Dead. Done.
DR. EVIL: One more peep out of you and you're grounded. Let's begin.
