ABBOTT: She say what time I should call?
ZORN: The sooner the better.
ZORN: I did my box work, but I wanted to show you before I showed Landy. I came out here last night because none of this was making any sense. I mean, I'm with you on this, Conklin was a nut, but a traitor? I just can't get there.
ABBOTT: What do you have, Danny?
ZORN: You put a four-gam Kel on here and it's gonna take out power to the building. You know that. What you can't know, is if it's gonna blow the room with it.
ABBOTT: And?
ZORN: There were two charges, they were supposed to go off simultaneously. The second one, the one that didn't go off, was down here... First of all, this is nothing, it's a sub-line for the breaker above. Second, why put the charge all the way down here? If you're good enough to get in here and handle the gear, you're good enough to know you don't need this. Bourne would know.
ABBOTT: It was staged?
ZORN: Is it a slam dunk? No, but...
ABBOTT: Jesus...
ZORN: Okay. What if someone decided to cover their tracks by blaming Conklin and Bourne. What if Bourne didn't have anything to do with this?
ABBOTT: Keep going...
ZORN: Something's been going on here in Europe. And it's still going on. Post Conklin. Who's been in Berlin?
ABBOTT: Lots of people...
ZORN: Including Landy... She had access to the archives.
ABBOTT: Who else knows about this?
ZORN: Nobody. You. I had to tell you, right?
ABBOTT: Show me again...
ZORN: Okay...
