I was told today my job doesn’t exist anymore. I had no indication that this would happen to anyone let alone me and I dont know what to do.
Was told at 9am that today was my last day. Found out later some real trash stuff on when my supervisor found out/how long they waited to tell me/how they told me. Just some bad juju in there. So I’m still salty and mourning and coping and it’s not going well so I need to focus on what’s next. 

I’ve filed for unemployment, but with COVID-19 I really just don’t think I’ll find a job for months. At least. Unemployment is half of what I have been making and living okay with. Not spending a ton, but spending 3/4 of my income each month on living. I’m scared that I won’t be able to cover my cost of living if I don’t get a job in the next month or so. 

I’m trying to look at this as a sign to make a move like I have been wanting to do and trying to rationalize doing; but will unemployment transfer states? It doesn’t feel financially smart to move states when I don’t have a job and the world is sick. But if I don’t move now, I’ll start a new job and then really not be able to move for years.

Any advise? What are you all doing to stay sane, or positive. I just want to wallow. I’m a pessimist and this is not going to go well from what I can see. What are y’all doing to stay busy? How can I find a job in this climate? Any experience with moving states like this? Anything would be really great. 

TL DR: lost my job and I’m salty, pessimistic, and lost. Help? Suggestions?
