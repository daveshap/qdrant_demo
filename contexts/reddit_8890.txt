What are the costs and benefits of means-testing college funding vs. universal higher education for students?
Recently, [AOC and Pete Buttigieg have clashed over the implementation of funding higher education for students](https://mobile.twitter.com/AOC/status/1200261361391017984), with AOC advocating for universal higher education, while Buttigieg has argued for means-testing to fund college for families under a certain income. 

That said, my question is simply what are the costs and benefits of means-tested (as in a plan like [Buttigieg's](https://peteforamerica.com/policies/higher-education/)) vs. universal (like [Sanders' plan](https://berniesanders.com/en/issues/free-college-cancel-debt/)) tuition-free college?
