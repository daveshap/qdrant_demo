Where does the gravitational energy come from We know that when a mass is pulled by gravitation it's kinetic energy increases.This is also the case when a photon is being radiated towards a massive body,its wave length decreases and it's energy increases. Since I know that energy is conserved,my question is,where does this extra energy come from?
