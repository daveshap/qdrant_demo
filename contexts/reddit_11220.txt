Update: at dinner mom said she was thankful for my sisters and brother and did not mention me in from of my entire family and aunt and cousin
Aunt is giving me dirty looks and I suspect that my parents complained about me to her. We’re eating at home, a meal of rice and chicken, after grocery shopping to save money on food. I spent the day writing and doing lsat problems. I haven’t left the hotel suite at all. I have not tried to talk to them about how they make me feel. I have just been miserably counting down until this will be over. 

If we cant afford to eat out on vacation why the fuck did we go on vacation?
