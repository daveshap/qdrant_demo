BRUCE: Somewhat like the lonesome secretary syndrome, I'd suppose.
SELINA: Executive Assistant. Secretary. Girlfriend?
BRUCE: Had one. Didn't work.
SELINA: What went wrong? Hang on, I think I know ... You kept things from her.
BRUCE: Nope, I told her everything.
SELINA: And the truth frightened her?
BRUCE: Well ... How can I put this. There were two truths ... and she had trouble reconciling them. Because <u>I</u> had trouble reconciling them. Vicki said.
SELINA: Vicki." Ice-skater
BRUCE: Photojournalist.
SELINA: Sure.
SELINA: Well? Was Vicki" right? About your difficulty with duality?"
BRUCE: If I said yes, then you might think me a Norman Bates, or a Ted Bundy type ... and then you might not let me kiss you.
SELINA: It's the so-called normal" guys who always let you down. Sickos never scare me. At least they're commited."
BRUCE: Ah ... then you've come to the right lonely mansion.
BRUCE: I, ah ... never fool around on the first date.
SELINA: Nor I, on the second.
BRUCE: What're you doing three dates from now?
