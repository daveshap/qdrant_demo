LLOYD: I didn't think you would! It seems to me, Karen, that for some tine, now, you've been developing a deep unconcern for the feeling of human being in general-
KAREN: I'm a human being, I've got some!
LLOYD: - and for my feelings in particular! For my play, my career - and now for a frightened, hysterical girl on the eve of her first night in the Theater!
KAREN: Have you forgotten about Eve? What she is, what she's done?
LLOYD: Old wives' tales, born of envy and jealousy! And a phobia against truth!
KAREN: Then tell me this isn't true! That your concern for your play and career is one thing - and that poor frightened hysterical girl another - and that your concern for her has nothing to do with either your play or your career!
