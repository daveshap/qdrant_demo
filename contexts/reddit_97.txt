so me and my girlfriend are 14 (we are both about to be 15) and we are in a long distance relationship, and the age of consent here in kansas in 16, so will it be okay for us to engage in phone sex when we are 16?
we’ve done it twice before but on the second time we got caught by my mom about a week ago, I didn’t get punish, but if we do do it again we won’t really be able to talk again and I don’t want that to happen because I love her very, very much. My mom said that because she doesn’t want us to take the path she did and since 16 is the age of consent I’m not exactly sure if it would be okay then
