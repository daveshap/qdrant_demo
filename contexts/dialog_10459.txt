BILLY LEE: You, you just need a new flint, General.
WASHINGTON: You are never, never to touch my guns! Do you understand!?
BILLY LEE: Yes, General. But if you have to shoot somebody, you can't.
WASHINGTON: None of the servants is to touch a gun! You know that!
BILLY LEE: Well... I misunderstood, then.
WASHINGTON: Misunderstood what!?
BILLY LEE: A lot of years have gone by.
WASHINGTON: What? What are you talking about?
BILLY LEE: That you would have known you can trust me.
