Steam account hacked! My steam account got hacked by visiting a phising website via my phone. My account details including my phone number and email account that has been linked to my steam account is changed. I have contacted steam support and provided screenshot of the message that I got in my mail regarding the changing of my account details. I have also provided them the payment details that I usually use to purchase games from steam. Can my steam account  still be recovered?
