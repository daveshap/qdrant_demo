Is it really worth it to take a low paying job in a field I think I might actually enjoy?
E: wow, can’t believe the amount of responses this has gotten. Thank you all for taking your time to try and offer help. I’ve been give a lot to think about and consider and can’t thank you folks enough.

I’ve applied to a job in a field I’d likely love (pro baseball) but it only pays $30k salary and it’s 2,000 miles away, where I know nobody. I went to school for sport management and haven’t found a full time job in the industry since I graduated in ‘17. I work a shitty job I don’t like that I consider to be a “fill-in” job, where I also make 30k and live in an area that has a much lower cost of living while I search elsewhere. I’m just floating along with no purpose or direction really, applying to jobs here and there in all sorts of different fields...though they all pay more than in sports. And student debt is a mother.

I literally have no idea what I’m doing or want to do with my life! I hope you folks have a good Saturday. 

Oh, and just for clarification: I am well aware and have been since I starting pursuing a career in sports that it’s a terribly low-paying field, especially at entry level. But then I became an adult and found myself actually having shit to pay for, so it all just adds to the uncertainty and indecision about working in sports. Pretending that my dumb ass could even land a full time job in the field (no pun intended), of course.
