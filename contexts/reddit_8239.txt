Why is the US recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and what are the political & social implications of this decision?
Today, President Trump is expected to [formally recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/06/world/middleeast/trump-jerusalem-israel-capital.html). This decision seemingly came out of nowhere, and I have a fairly limited understanding of what this means for the middle east. Could anybody please provide some clarity on this in context to what it means for the future of the middle eastern political landscape

To summarize, I have a 2 main questions:

- What are the factors that led to this decision?
- What are the political implications of this decision?
