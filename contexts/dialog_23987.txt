MAX: She sounds like a prisoner, Taransky. Are you holding her hostage? Are you some kind of Svengali?
VIKTOR: Who's the hostage, Sayer, her or you? You look kind of captive" yourself. While you're spending every waking hour obsessing over Simone
MAX: The cops? The cops read my column to know who to bust. We're the only watchdog the public has. None of this is going away. We'll be here tomorrow and the day after that. Until you slip up. And you will. You are looking at your shadow. Because all these elaborate precautions with Simone -- every instinct in my body tells me, it's not natural.
VIKTOR: I'm just trying to help you, Sayer. I don't want you to be disappointed. It gets cold out here at night.
MAX: Nice try. If we can't get to her through you, maybe your family will be more co-operative. I can guarantee you, Taransky, one way or another, Miss Simone and I are going to get acquainted.
VIKTOR: I'd like to see that, Sayer. Invite me.
