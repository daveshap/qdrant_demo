How to build the database for subdomain multisite? I'm building a kind of \"multi site application\" based on wildcard subdomain. And every site will of course have the same files but also the same database structure. But it's not necessary for each and other to share tables. They will never use each other's datas.So the best would be if they had their own tables, in their own databases. But then it's more difficult to develop the service since I have to do all the changes to all the databases when I change something.So the best would be if every database could mirror each other in the terms of structure.Is this possible? Or what is the most recommended solution for this situation?
