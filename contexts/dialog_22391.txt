JEAN-PIERRE: He sees this differently, as you well know.
SAM: I didn't expect that he would.
JEAN-PIERRE: You suffered through an agonizing pain last night, pain you could have avoided by declaring yourself an agent of the law.
SAM: Vincent told you that I'm a cop?
JEAN-PIERRE: Not a word. But no ordinary criminal would have the extensive military and medical expertise you do. And so I place the pieces of the puzzle together in a way that makes sense to me. You work for some government agency and you carry a gun, and in my world, that makes you a cop.
SAM: So this is what, a test?
JEAN-PIERRE: Call it a reckoning of character.
SAM: If I was healthy, I could take that away from you.
JEAN-PIERRE: Perhaps. But you are not healthy, and if you try I'll kill you.
SAM: So what is it you want to know?
JEAN-PIERRE: I suppose I want to know how a man like you is created.
SAM: Created?
JEAN-PIERRE: Perhaps forged is a better word. Like steel. Like a sword. You're a modern Samurai. I've spent my life around extraordinary men -- men like Vincent. But I've never seen anyone like you. I'm afraid Vincent will die if he goes with you.
SAM: Vincent's life is his own burden; he'll have to carry it for himself. And I'm not any kind of Samurai.
JEAN-PIERRE: You seem one to me.
SAM: A Samurai has honor, a Samurai live by the code of Bushido, the way of the warrior. I'm just a killer for hire. The world isn't about honor, anymore. It's about survival.
