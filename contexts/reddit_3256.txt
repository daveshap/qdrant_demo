I lied and it got me in a stupid career pickle, any suggestions?
**Backstory:** I started my career about 2 years ago in a junior IT position, and a salary to match. Well, I've grown professionally a lot since then and thought I'd start looking around for an opportunity that might pay more. I got 3 offers, all in the +10% range, and chose one of them that I liked.

Well, when I told my current company that I'd be moving on, they wanted to know how much the new place was offering, and what it'd take for me to stay. I gave them a number that seemed astronomical to me, and I thought they'd never accept. Well, they did. Today they offered me an annual salary just shy of twice my current, a position as lead engineer, and a relocation package to move to the company headquarters. Basically my dream job.

**The problem:** When they initially asked me how much the other place's offer was, I gave them a number a bit higher than it actually was. I don't know why, but it was really stupid. I guess I said that out of spite since I felt they had been underpaying me. The manager that talked with me about this (upper management actually, not my regular manager) requested a copy of that offer letter as part of whatever processing they do to get me into the new position. I said I'd get it to him....

What should I do??? I'm someone who values honesty, and this just makes me feel really really bad. If I confess, it makes me look stupid and dishonest. I have no logical reason to not send it over. I thought about "correcting" the letter, but I'm sure they will call to verify, and then I'm really screwed (with both companies).

I'm not going to do that again for sure.
