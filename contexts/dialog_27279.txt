WELL-MANICURED MAN: Mr. Mulder.
MULDER: What happened to Kurtzweil?
WELL-MANICURED MAN: He's come and gone.
MULDER: Where's Scully?
WELL-MANICURED MAN: I have answers for you.
MULDER: Is she alive?
WELL-MANICURED MAN: Yes.
WELL-MANICURED MAN: I'm quite prepared to tell you everything, though there isn't much you haven't guessed.
MULDER: About the conspiracy?
WELL-MANICURED MAN: I think of it as an agreement. A word your father liked to use.
MULDER: I want to know where Scully is.
