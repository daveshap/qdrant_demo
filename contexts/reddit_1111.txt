Anyone else get irrationally anxious to the point where they just clear notifications instead of reading them?
Lately I've noticed I've been putting more off than usual, including even looking at my phone. I can't explain it. I know for a fact that when I open noticifications I receive, I'm the only one I can tell that they were seen. That still doesn't stop the feeling I get when I think about looking them. Panic, i feel like I'm gonna disappoint whoever the sender is with whatever I come up with as a response. It's ridiculous, I feel ridiculous. Anyone have any solutions to anything like this? Not currently on medication, working on getting on it (I'm canadian and need to apply for a physician because my childhood one is no longer my family's provider), I'm 23 year old male if that matters.
