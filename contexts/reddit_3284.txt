Should I remove my photo on Linkedin?
I have been having such a difficult time with finding getting interviews and finding jobs. I apply mainly on indeed and linkedin. Basically, I belong to a religion which is often stereotyped and I dont want a negative bias to happen before the interviewer meets me at least. I wear the hijab and will also be wearing it at work. 

I was just wondering whether I should:
1. Keep the picture and keep applying 
2. Upload a new picture, maybe so zoomed in that they cant see my hijab? 
3. Remove the pic completely 

What do you guys think? Tired of not getting interviews and I just want a chance.
