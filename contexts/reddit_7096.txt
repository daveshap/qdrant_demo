Leaving the corporate rat race behind: who has left the job market to start a business and succeeded?
So my wife and I were doing our finances over the holiday period, and thankfully we are doing well and on the right track. As part of our financial independence and retirement strategy we want to move away from corporate jobs and into something that we can call “our own”. 

Business wise, we consider that there is a certain level of investment required, and that we have the finances and capital enough to loan against and maybe buy something freehold with a business.

So I just wanted to ask, has anyone left the traditional work force to start a business? What were your reasons? How did it go? 

I’m well aware of the statistics that show that a large number of businesses fail, and probably a large number barely make enough money to be profitable. I even remember reading somewhere about someone who started their own business and found they worked double the hours of their employees for half of what they paid their employees!

So please, post your stories, thoughts, experiences and opinions.
