LOUIS: Should we go?
JANINE: I don't think we should leave her alone.
LOUIS: You're right. We should stay.
VIGO: I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia --
JANOSZ: Yes, the scourge --
VIGO: -- the sorrow of Moldavia --
JANOSZ: -- the sorrow --
VIGO: I command you.
JANOSZ: I await the word of Vigo.
VIGO: The season of evil begins with the birth of the new year. Bring me the child that I might live again.
JANOSZ: Lord Vigo, the mother, Dana, is fine and strong. I was wondering -- well, would it be possible -- if I bring the baby, could I have the woman?
VIGO: So be it. On this the day of darkness, she will be ours, wife to you and mother to me.
