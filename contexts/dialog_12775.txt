MURPHY: Hello, Harvard! Got anything new on the hanging?
BENSINGER: Why don't you fellows get your own news?
HILDY: Can't you say 'hello' to a fellow?
BENSINGER: Hildy!
BENSINGER: Are you back?
HILDY: No, just a farewell appearance, batting for Sweeney. I'm going into business for myself.
BENSINGER: What doing?
HILDY: I'm getting married tomorrow.
BENSINGER: Well, congratulations! Good luck!
