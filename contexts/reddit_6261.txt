Finally found a job, starting Monday.. but just realized I don't have two forms of ID. Will this bar me from starting?
Title. I spoke with my manager-to-be on Wednesday and he told me I needed to bring two forms of ID when I start on Monday, presumably for HR stuff. I went to get my social security card from my safe and realized my social security card and birth certificate were destroyed a few months ago.. don't really want to get into how, but yeah. 

I've looked into getting them replaced and won't be able to until mid-late next week at the earliest. So I'll only have my driver's license as a form of ID on Monday, and now I'm pretty much freaking out. I don't have a passport..

Will this likely disallow me from starting on Monday? What are my options here? I thought about calling my manager but the office is closed for Good Friday.
