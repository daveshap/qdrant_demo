What is the way to represent a Lorentz tensor field? For a vector field one can represent this with an array of arrows.There is a standard sort of way to represent tensors in Euclidean space as small ellipses.Is there any standard way of representing tensors with (+-) signature? For example, perhaps small light cones? One could use ellipses as well, but this would not really give an idea of where time-like and space-like directions are at each point. Maybe an ellipse with a cross in it?Is there a common way of representing this on a 2D plane?
