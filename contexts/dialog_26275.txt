GILLIS: Sorry, Miss Schaefer, but I've given up writing on spec.
BETTY: I tell you this is half sold.
GILLIS: As a matter of fact. I've given up writing altogether.
MAX: Mr. Gillis, if you please.
GILLIS: Right with you.
ARTIE: The accent! I've got it: this guy is in the pay of a foreign government. Get those studs. Get those cuff-links.
GILLIS: I've got to run along. Thanks any- way for your interest in my career.
BETTY: It's not your career -- it's mine. I kind of hoped to get in on this deal. I don't want to be a reader all my life. I want to write.
GILLIS: Sorry if I crossed you up.
BETTY: You sure have.
GILLIS: So long.
