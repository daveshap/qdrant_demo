After a 7-month long emotionally abusive relationship, I went on my first date with someone new last night and it was unbelievably wholesome.
So as the title says I was in an emotionally abusive relationship from late last year to earlier this year. My self-esteem and self-worth were extremely compromised and I was manipulated into believing that I’d never find anyone better who could “put up with me.” We broke up and I did a lot of work on myself. Started going to the gym more, eating better, went to therapy for a bit, developed a clearer vision for my future, etc. I put off dating until I started to love myself and value myself more. 

Fast forward to a week ago when I redownloaded some dating apps and matched with someone who I really felt I connected with. We went on our first date yesterday and had an amazing time. He was super respectful and we shared many laughs together. Although my self-confidence now comes from within and doesn’t depend on the opinions of others, he really boosted it. I have a good feeling about this and I just wanted a place to share how happy I am with my personal accomplishments and successes!
