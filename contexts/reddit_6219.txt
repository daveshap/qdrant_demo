New Employee Onboarding before interview?
Hi, so I applied to a position that seems to be a part of a personnel services thing(they have a bunch of positions for random things that are temp to hire) and I received a call for an interview with these people. After I said I was still looking they sent me onboarding stuff(background check, I-9, W-4, Bank Account) to fill out prior to the interview. Is this normal?
I've only ever had to do this stuff from the National Park Service and that was after the interview and after being hired, but before actually showing up.

Thanks!
