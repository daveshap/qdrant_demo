How do I go about asking my supervisor that I want to take on more responsibilities?
I currently work at a radio station that only has about 10 employees. Most of the employees are much older than me, with the exception of the part-time employees. 

Currently my title is “data entry specialist” so I do minimal office work. My work is starting to become monotonous and I want more responsibilities. 

I’m going back to school now in an unrelated field, but I’d like to have a backup plan. Maybe working in the office more, or at least seek out a job that’s in an office setting.

What’s the proper way to ask my supervisor that I want more responsibilities?
