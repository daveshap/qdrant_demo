Tips for making an employee training program?
So I have the opportunity to basically design the training program for my job position (we have about 6 technicians nationally and will probably increase to 10, plus the constant turnover anyways), and I have some ideas. However, i dont really know how to design an effective program and wondering if anyone has tips and/or useful reading on designing them? This is a technical job with several skills/knowledge topics (electrical theory, networking, mechanical design, hydraulics/pneumatics, etc.), several equipment, and a couple softwares to learn, just to give an idea what kind of training program.
