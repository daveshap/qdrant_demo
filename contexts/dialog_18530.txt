LADY ELY: It's Mr Brown, ma'am.
VICTORIA: What is he doing there?
LADY ELY: He appears to be ... standing by his horse.
VICTORIA: I made no request to go out riding today. How long has he been there?
LADY ELY: I don't know, ma'am. He was observed earlier, I believe.
VICTORIA: Sir Henry, Mr Brown is standing in the courtyard. I have no wish to go riding.
PONSONBY: I'm very sorry, ma'am. I can't imagine -- he was certainly given no instructions.
VICTORIA: Please make sure it does not happen again.
PONSONBY: Of course, at once.
