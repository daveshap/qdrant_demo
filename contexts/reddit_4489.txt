Can someone maybe help give me a little encouragement to get out of bed?
I need to shower, its been 4 days. My hair is greasy and I probably smell.  Im seeing a tattoo artist in the afternoon and I should be happy but I cant get out of this bed. I know I need to, I know I should, but it just feels like a weight on my chest. I just cant bring myself to get up and put effort into looking presentable. 

I have to shower then I have to dry my hair and get dressed and put on makeup and eat something and go outside. It just seems like too much. 

I feel guilty because I blame myself for being lazy. My depressions been worse recently because I lost what I would call my ESA last week. I had him for almost 11 years and he kept me alive. I adopted a new cat but its not the same. He hasnt been around long enough to have the same connection. It does help ease the grief a little though. I was told I was too dramatic for heavily grieving for my cat so Ive been holding it all in. I dont want to bother anyone. 

Honestly I could just use some encouragement. Some motivation maybe. Thank you for just reading this even if you don't respond.
