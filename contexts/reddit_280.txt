Parents bought personal lubricant and when I asked what it was they refused to tell me
So a package came into the mail and I assumed it was my father’s books or something (it was a heavy package) so I opened it up.  I asked my dad about it when I saw it was lubricant but he told me to just forget it and not tell my mom.  

Originally I thought the lubricant was like for my dad’s car since he like to work on his cars until I read the directions. I always viewed my parents as sort of very conservative but I guess I’m wrong about that.  

What can lubricant be used for?
