[Update] I Quit Dating In Virtual World
Quick Recap: Cute guy on  NY Subway approached me we had a date and sparks were flying!! I had to tell him that he needed to have his “fun” because it’s a natural process for him but I had gotten out of a relationship prior to meeting him and I had to be mature about the sparks but that I didn’t want to be part of his “fun” process. Because of him that’s how I found out I want to meet my significant other in the real world n not virtually.

2019!!! not even two hours in he bumps into me at a random Subway Station in Manhattan crowded with people. We took the train together and he kept saying to ppl he was with, I just keep meeting her in the subway this must mean something. We talked about music mostly and how we where doing. He asked me out for a date. Wish Me Luck Internet!!! 

Happy New Year!
