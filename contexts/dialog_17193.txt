CLARA: I'm afraid of being lonely.
MARTY: Oh, you won't be so lonely. You'll make friends right away.
CLARA: Actually, I don't make friends easily.
MARTY: What're you talking about? You're a real likeable person. You'll make friends out there in Portchester one, two, three. You'll have people visiting you alla time. I'll come visit you.
