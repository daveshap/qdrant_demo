Is it normal to "think" you're overcoming depression when everything you do shows otherwise?
I've had depression and anxiety for over 8 years. I feel like I'm way better than I was before but sometimes it feels I'm just lying to myself. Is it normal?

I feel I'm pretending I don't see this dark monster looming over me everytime I say I'm getting better. I'm on antidepressants and they help but it feels I'm going to take them forever. I tell myself I'm more social now! But I know for a fact I only talk to two friends and more often than not ignore them when they want to hang out. I feel like I care about my appearance now, but I'm heavier than ever. I feel like I care about my future but I keep missing classes because I simply cannot find the will to go. I want to have a relationship but everytime someone interested approaches me, I panic that they'll know there's something wrong with me and leave me.

I'm usually very bubbly and positive on my daily life but when I stay quiet for a moment, I feel as if I have this mask that threatens to fall off and show everyone how I really am.
At night I refuse to aknowledge my intrusive thoughts so I fall asleep while reading, listening to music or watching videos. Am I avoiding reality? Is it a good coping technique? What is it?

I just can't trust my own thoughts because they were the ones that led me here so I never know if I'm taking the necessary steps towards recovery and this is a normal setback or if I'm lying to myself and pretending everything's getting better  because I can't deal with the fact I'm never going to get out of this hellhole.

(.....And now I'm thinking I'm being dramatic and I need to get over it and I should not post it because maybe I'm enabling my depression every time I try to aknowledge it. Damn. Sorry for my english btw.)
