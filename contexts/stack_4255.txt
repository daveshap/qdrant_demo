Why is my Dark World so dark? My hero has to journey into a mirror world. This world is much like our own except evil. Almost everything there is an enemy and there will be very little kindness. On top of that the world is visibly DARK.It isn't just a metaphor and the sun hasn't gone away. It isn't just cloudy/stormy all the time. Somehow in this other world the light is just less shiny. Colors are dimmer. Shades are more monochrome and grey. What could be causing this?  What are some of the hidden ramifications of this?It is reached through a breach made by magic. It's a mirror world or another dimension but otherwise almost exactly like our earth. Trees are shaped the same and behave the same way. People are people shaped, just meaner. Temperatures are comparable. There may be some anachronisms but not many. Possibly in the form of demons or fantastical beasts. Houses will mostly be in the same places, except where The Big Bad Evil Guy lives. Changes to one world should not necessarily effect the other, but they can if it benefits the answer or the logic behind the answer.Criteria:Although these worlds have magic the less that it is used for theanswer the better.Preferably it can be reverted at the end of the story.Bonus Points: If it is something the Big Bad Evil Guy made happen.
