Everyone wants YOU to do something, but noone wants to help YOU in person.
That's how it is. It's all a lie, all pretending, all fake.

If you'll ever go to a psychiatrist...

If you'll ever go to a therapist...

If you'll ever go to a psychologist...

Or even if you ever come across some random on the internet, or in real life...

They are all smart asses, all knowing, but not even one of them will ever give you a hand. It's like coaching. Giving worthless advice.

Poor? Get a job.

Sad? Find happiness.

Lonely? Meet people.

Wow, really? Wow, thank you so much, I didn't know it's that simple! Wow! Thank you my savior. I'll be rich now, happy, and have plenty of friends. I was so stupid, thank you for showing me the way.

That's the point, that's the key. 32 fucking years, and you dare to say me, do something?!

"A drowning man will clutch at a straw", but you first need to give them one.

A lot of people could be saved if they had ANYONE by their side, cut the bullshit, and chit chat. If you're not here with me, then just fuck off. I don't need no imaginary fake friends. I wouldn't mind friends with benefits though, at least there would be benefits, obviously.
