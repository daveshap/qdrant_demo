Just delete Tinder
I will admit since joining Tinder I have;

Lost 60 pounds  

Re-Enrolled in school (I'm now a Dean's list student)  

Quit smoking  

Got a therapist  

Cut my hair  

Finished my first album  

Moved into my own place (no roommates)  

At first, it was the idea of making myself have a broader appeal to women that encouraged me to make these changes. Suddenly, I started getting matches...

Sometimes a ton!  

But it never mattered. I've been on 4 tinder dates in the past 3 years.  

However, I love my life now... and I've realized a couple things;  

Not everyone has to like you, so don't make people pleasing a priority  

And,  

Sometimes you outgrow the things you thought you wanted.  

Yeah, that girl with the Venmo account on her profile may match with me now.  

But she still just wants my money.  

And to be frank, I don't deserve to feel unwanted. Most people are on that app to kill time, fool around, and scam fools.  

So delete the app if it makes you feel shitty.
