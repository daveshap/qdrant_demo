Close a game/app on Xbox One Is there a way of closing games/apps open on Xbox One?It seems every time after you press the Home button, go out navigate through Home/the main system, and then come back to the game, it is still open, which is good. However, it seems that it only closes and frees up memory only after you open another game/app.Does anyone have more information on this?
