INTERVIEWER: Do you think that the government is winning the battle against terrorists?
HELPMANN: On yes. Our morale is much higher than theirs, we're fielding all their strokes, running a lot of them out, and pretty consistently knocking them for six. I'd say they're nearly out of the game.
INTERVIEWER: But the bombing campaign is now in its thirteenth year ...
HELPMANN: Beginner's luck.
INTERVIEWER: Thank you very much, Deputy Minister.
HELPMANN: Thank you, David ... and a very merry Christmas to you all.
