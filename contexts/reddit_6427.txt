What do people do in office jobs?
I know there’s probably a super obvious answer here, but all the people who sit in a cubicle all day, what exactly are you doing? And how do these activities profit the company to the point that they pay you a salary?

Be nice, I’m just wondering because I’ve always worked in the blue collar and am ignorant as to what happens in the big corporate offices.

Edit: sorry the flair doesn’t fit but I had to pick one and couldn’t find any that applied

Edit 2: Thank you to everyone who was contributed. Since this has gotten a lot of comments I won’t be replying to everyone, but I am reading all of the comments and appreciate what everyone is saying. Thanks for helping me understand!
