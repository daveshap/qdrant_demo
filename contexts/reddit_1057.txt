I got my drivers license.. at 29
I finally did it.. It took me until early this year to start working on my license (first aid, theory, driving hours)  
My 1st attempt I ended up having my exam hour on the one day when it was raining so hard I could barely see out of the car (I'd never driven in rain before)... I completely panicked and froze and, of course, didn't pass

  
I had my 2nd attempt yesterday, and even though I was shaking/sweating and (as the instructor later pointed out) made a couple of mistakes - I passed  
About 11 years late compared to everyone else my age, but I finally have my license
