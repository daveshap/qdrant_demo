How often are you expected to work outside of working hours?
Curious to see how much other employers expect their employees to work evenings or weekends.  Is this something that is expected with a certain salary?  I have a salary of 75k and often have to work over the weekend from home and Iâ€™m getting kinda tired of it but I wonder if this is kind of the norm these days.
