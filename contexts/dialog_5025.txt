ZEPH: What nasty bug crawled up your bungus and where the hell are you going?
PIKE: I'm leaving, man. I'm bailing town. This place has gotten way too hairy.
ZEPH: Where am I gonna find another mechanic stupid enough to work for my money?
PIKE: Hey, have you seen Benny lately?
ZEPH: No... You want me to give him a message?
PIKE: You should think about leaving, too, man. Sell this place... Something's going on here. I don't know. Something real weird.
ZEPH: Ah, you'll be coming back.
PIKE: I don't think so.
ZEPH: All right. Take care of yourself.
PIKE: I am.
ZEPH: Hey. What should I do if I see Benny?
PIKE: Run.
