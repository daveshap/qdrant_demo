There's a girl.
I met this girl, Hannah, from a mutual friend of ours. She is stunning. We have a lot in common and the same interests. What bothers me is that she has a boyfriend. Hannah and I like each other but yeah her having a boyfriend. She told me one day when she came over that he broke up with her. Over some stupid reason "I'm not getting enough sleep." We spent the day together talking and cuddling. Friday night I was going to ask her out. I went on her phone for a second to do something for her. As I'm doing it she gets a message from her ex. "I can't stop thinking about you. I'm glad were together again <3" I just wanted to go home at that point. I've been up in my room since I got home, only coming out for restroom and food. 

I stopped answering her calls and texts. I don't want to talk to her at this time.
