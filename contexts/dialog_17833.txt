BILLY: No, I'm not afraid.
DETECTIVE: Good. There's nothing to be afraid of. If you co-operate with us, you will be on the plane for New York tomorrow... yes?
BILLY: Yes...?
DETECTIVE: Good. Now, where did you get the hashish?
BILLY: A cabdriver. He picked me up in the Pudding Shoppe in the bazaar.
DETECTIVE: Would you recognize him again?
BILLY: Yes. I think so.
DETECTIVE: Good. Would you go back to the Pudding Shoppe now and point him out to my men if you see him?
