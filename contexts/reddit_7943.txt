A bit of a garble about advisors after graduation and a small FYI
I am 10 months out of grad school. I got out by fighting and clawing against a pretty rough advisor (fighting over edits (that he forgot he did) sabotage (his employees were told to do it) and poor understanding of the data and what we were trying to show (I’d say equal parts naughty here)).  

But I finally did it. It was bad enough that I left my field (but not science!) to find a job. He emailed me several times asking when I was going to publish, but I didn’t answer back. I hate his editing (he doesn’t actually read and then gets made later and makes you rewrite months of work on a whim), he made tons of promises he didn’t even come close to keeping, and then let others sabotage my lab space (not that it was secure enough for micro work in the first place...but that’s my mistake for not fighting it earlier).  He didn’t agree to let me graduate. That was another fight on its own. Luckily for me, every one signed off and I was able to get free. So like I said, rough but done. I did it. (Sorry for the rant, it’s things I can’t quite say to him yet haha)

10 months. Several emails “just checking in” on me unanswered because I am still dealing from the damage done. I have a job in a lab doing things completely unrelated to my field, but damn, money in the bank (seriously it’s still a bit lower then middle class but it’s more then grad school Hahahaha)! 

And then he sends an email letting me know if he doesn’t hear back he’s gonna publish my work (copy/ paste from my thesis) and add me as co-author.... with out input for how my work and data are used?!!

Whaaattt we didn’t even agree on what my data said and now were all the sudden publishing?!? 
Can he do that?!? 

How do I respond? He’s copied two people from my committee as well??? What the heck is going on here? I start to spiral back into the ridiculous unhealthy mindset that I had been healing from away from grad school. Freaking out- typing up really angry responses and deleting them- like over and over seriously not even sure what I am saying.

Then I remembered - I’m not alone!!! I called my undergrad advisor (super great full for ‘em) and said how the heck do I respond????

 He gave me some great advice- 
1. Unless you signed a contract saying he owns your work- he can’t publish your work with out proving he “couldn’t find you”. (I am certain this was his plan since I didn’t respond to his more buddy buddy emails). 
2. Don’t email back in the chain. The other people have a stake in getting the data published- they need to know that you can no longer work with your former advisor due to personal reasons. You can explain what happened to your data with out going into detail. (I didn’t find out about the sabotage until after I graduated when an employee told me about what they were told to do)
3. Call the other people publishing on this paper and ask them what they want to do about it. (Like, do they want to do the edits maybe so I can continue to write? Do they want to be the bridge?) 

I haven’t gotten to call the others yet. And honestly, my husband saw me pacing on the phone and handed me a drink...so I will do that first thing tomorrow. 

I just wanted to remind any one who might be in a similar bad advisor place that your not stuck, they don’t OWN you, and sometimes you might remember you have places you can go to for advice. (Even if it’s just reddit) just get thru the spiral. 

I know this was a bit rant-y, and it seems like it was all rough, but honestly the work was amazing, and I’m so damned proud of it :) I would love to do it forever, and some day I will find something in my field - so keep your head up! 

Long story short- grad school was f’ed up yo. But they don’t own you. Make sure you own your work- respond to emails- and work around the problems. Your not alone, enjoy the journey when you can. 

 Thanks for listening :)  enjoy your banana you filthy heathens 🍌🍌🍌
