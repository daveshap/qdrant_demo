KILLIAN: The Widow Windsor.
ICHABOD: Is that all you say? Look at her.
KILLIAN: It's not something people speak of openly. She did not remarry.
ICHABOD: What is the common thread between these victims?
YOUNG MASBATH: I'm sure I don't know.
ICHABOD: We must discover it. The reason the murderer chose these persons.
ICHABOD: The wounds are the same. Cauterized. No chopping or half-measures either. One stroke took the head. Have you seen, doctor... ? Even the spinal bone... sliced as smooth as butter.
DOCTOR LANCASTER: I do not care. You are welcome to use my work area, but I beg you... return her to her resting place.
ICHABOD: In time, doctor. Soon as I finish.
