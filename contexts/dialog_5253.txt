ACE: But nobody had to take care of Nicky.
NICKY: You find any cash in there, we'll whack it up with you.
ACE: I mean, he took care of himself only too well. And that's why every badge back home wanted to nail him.
JENNIFER: Excuse me, but I folded these things beautifully and I would appreciate a little respect. Jesus Christ!
NICKY: Don't look at me, pal. I gotta live with her.
ACE: Even after a little vacation, they hassled him at the airport.
COP #1: Excuse me.
ACE: I mean, Frank Marino was there to meet him, but so were the cops. This time they wanted to pinch him for some diamond burglary in Antwerp.
JENNIFER: Oh, yes. Will you help me fold these, please?
ACE: They were ready to blame him for anything, no matter where it happened.
JENNIFER: You go and put your things away.
ACE: And they were usually right.
MARINO: Whoa, whoa, whoa.
NICKY: Hold it, hold it. Here.
ACE: Because Nicky enjoyed being a gangster, and he didn't give a damn who knew it.
JENNIFER: Come on. There we go. Look at that. Beautiful.
ACE: I mean, that's what worried me, 'cause it turns out Nicky was about to be sent to Vegas.
JENNIFER: All right, we're clear.
NICKY: There's more!
JENNIFER: I think that's it.
NICKY: There's more! There's a couple stuck in there. I know there's more.
JENNIFER: God, I'm telling you, they're out!
NICKY: Come on, damn it. Don't get so defensive. It could be stuck in your hair, you know.
JENNIFER: Look, there aren't... There aren't but...
NICKY: Oh, there aren't? What's that? Huh? What's that. There's no more. Thanks, hon.
