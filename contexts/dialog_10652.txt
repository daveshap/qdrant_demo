MURPHY: Obviously it's some kind of screw up. The shipping records aren't a hundred percent accurate.
DODGE: Man, it gives me the creeps. We got no business towing a ship that size anyway. I say we fix the turbines and hit the highway.
GREER: Are you crazy? Do you realize we got ourselves a ship? We own a ship, Dodge.
DODGE: Yeah, a ship that's supposed to have been lost at sea fifty years ago. You don't think that's just a little freaky?
EPPS: If this thing turns out to be a ship everybody thought sank a long time ago, we just hit the jackpot.
DODGE: Yeah, well how the hell you get something like that wrong? That's a damn big boat. It's either sunk or it ain't.
