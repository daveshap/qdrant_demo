CHARLIE: What do your instincts tell you to do now, kid?
WESLEY: Leave. Take this shit back to Detroit and get the rest of our money.
CHARLIE: We could do that. I could be on my way to Florida, and you could go to Thailand and fuck your brains out.
WESLEY: ...but that's not what we're gonna do, is it?
CHARLIE: No... if we don't finish this job, how are we gonna look at ourselves in the mirror? This is it for me, Wesley, she's the last one. My instinct says I gotta see this through with her, and if there's one thing I've tried to teach you here --
WESLEY: It's to follow my instincts. And my instincts say get the fuck out of Dodge.
CHARLIE: No, I said to follow 'my' instincts. Now, we go up there and conclude our business. Case closed.
