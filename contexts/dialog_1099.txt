SLOAN: I'd like to talk to you, I really would, but my lawyers say I shouldn't until after the Watergate trial.
WOODWARD: You handed out the money. Maybe there's a legitimate explanation for the way it was done--
BERNSTEIN: --then again, maybe things are even worse than we've written--
SLOAN: --they're worse. That's why I quit.
SLOAN: Try and understand this. I'm a decent Republican. I believe in Richard Nixon. I worked in the White House four years--so did my wife. What happened on June 17 I don't think the President knew anything about. Some of his men I'm not so sure of.
BERNSTEIN: Do you think the truth will come out at the trial?
SLOAN: That's another of the things I'm not so sure of.
BERNSTEIN: Because people at the Committee were told to lie to the prosecutors?
SLOAN: We were never told flat out Don't talk." But the message was clear."
BERNSTEIN: To cover up?
SLOAN: Well, they sure didn't ask us to come forward and tell the truth.
WOODWARD: Does they" mean the White House?"
SLOAN: As opposed to the Committee? The Committee's not an independent operation. Everything is cleared with the White House. I don't think that the FBI or the prosecutors understand that.
WOODWARD: The report on the cash in Maurice Stans' safe, the three hundred fifty thousand, that's true?
SLOAN: No. It was closer to seven hundred thousand.
WOODWARD: And as treasurer, you could release those funds?
SLOAN: When so ordered.
WOODWARD: We're not sure we've got all the guys who could order you, but we know there were five.
