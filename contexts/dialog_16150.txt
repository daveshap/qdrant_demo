GEORGE: Can you keep Sam straight?
ALYSSA: He's not gay. I found out purely by accident, believe me.
GEORGE: I mean drugs. I thought you said he was?
ALYSSA: He wouldn't use around me. I don't like any of it.
GEORGE: You're a good girl.
ALYSSA: I need to ask you something, Mr. Nelson.
GEORGE: You have to ask like that?
ALYSSA: I want you to try something with me, okay?
GEORGE: I've taken a lot of morphine. Oral morphine...for my back. Can I wait till I can say no and sound convincing?
ALYSSA: Did you feel anything?
GEORGE: Maybe your tongue...I don't know, my mouth is numb. Why did you do that?
