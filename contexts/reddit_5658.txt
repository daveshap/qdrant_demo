Laid off mid March due to COVID-19, receiving unemployment in KY, offered temporary position for low pay.
Seeking advice here as I want to get back in the workforce but the position I was offered is temporary 80-100 hours selling office supplies on EBay for $15 an hour. They reached out to me because I interviewed for a sales position that pays $60,000 plus commission at their company (similar compensation to my previous position). The employer is waiting to pull the trigger on full time role until COVID clears up. I think they want to hire me for the full time role and this may be a way of locking me in for the short term. But I’m concerned that I won’t be able to refile for unemployment if they don’t end up hiring me for the full time role. Does anyone have any advice as what I should do? 

I want to start working so there isn’t a big gap on my resume. I was laid off from my first job out of school, I started as an intern at the company and was completely shocked when they told me my position was eliminated March 13th. This was a sales role and I have degrees in Finance and Economics. I really want to be a financial advisor but all the testing centers are closed so I can’t get my certifications to start.
