I, a software engineer, was recently got laid off because of the pandemic. What can I learn to improve myself in the meantime and when should I start to apply again?
Hi all,

For the past 3 years, I was working as a software engineer for an aerospace company (not the big ones like Boeing, Raytheon, NG). At this company, they have their own coding language but it was very similar to Python and I'm sure not a lot of people outside of this company will recognize this language. Now that I'm looking for work again, should I stay in the aerospace industry and hope to apply my aviation knowledge or should I brush up my coding and apply for a role at a non-aviation company?

I'm sure I'm not the only one that is laid off during this time and I hope everyone is taking care of themselves.

Thank you for your time!
