I have applied to 668 jobs since I joined Linkedin Premium in 2017 and the best interview I got was for $60k but no offer, what can I do to improve my marketability?
Current job: Clinical Research Coordinator (Public University) 

Salary: $50k 

Benefits: Ok 

Education: Bachelors of Arts in Sociology (2.8 GPA)

I got accepted to a data analytics certificate program but had to drop out because of my workload at work got too crazy and feel behind. Ideally, I'd like to go back to school, but income is most important right now and finding a decent work-life balance seems to be hard. Our department is grossly understaffed and I am constantly swamped.... right now I am doing the bare minimum and applying to jobs like crazy, but what am I doing wrong here or what is wrong with me?

Any suggestions?
