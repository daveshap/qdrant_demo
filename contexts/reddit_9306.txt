Just a friendly reminder to stop eating out/buying junk food at convenient stores (-85.00).
I added up the past couple weeks of chinese Food, Dominoes, cheetos, jalapeno chips, Wawa brownies, etc, and I am shocked. 

Poverty financiers, please, stop eating out or buying random junk food. It is not worth it. I am redoing my budget, pulling from my savings to cover my monthly expenses deficient this month(sadly) and it is a sad feeling. I had a goal to save $100.00 month. It is not clear if I can make it. 

My problem is that I am under a lot of stress (first year teacher, every day is hell), and I am a huge emotional eater. I will have to find another way to get the stress out (I'm maxed out at the gym, going 6 days a week of heavy weight training and swimming. Maybe more video games? Post workout after teaching?)

Slamming my forehead against the wall on this one. 

Edit: Thanks for the silver! My first!
