SAM: This sort of takes the sting out of being occupied, doesn't it, Mr. Richard?
RICK: You said it! Here's looking at you, kid.
RICK: My German's a little rusty.
ILSA: It's the Gestapo. They say they expect to be in Paris tomorrow.
ILSA: With the whole world crumbling, we pick this time to fall in love.
RICK: Yeah. It's pretty bad timing. Where were you, say, ten years ago?
ILSA: Ten years ago? Let's see... ...Yes. I was having a brace put on my teeth. Where were you?
RICK: Looking for a job.
ILSA: Was that cannon fire, or is it my heart pounding?
RICK: Ah, that's the new German 77. And judging by the sound, only about thirty-five miles away.
RICK: And getting closer every minute. Here. Drink up. We'll never finish the other three.
SAM: The Germans'll be here pretty soon now, and they'll come looking for you. And don't forget there's a price on your head.
