Being single and in your 30's is financially amazing. Anyone else agree?
I've never really thought about this until the virus. I have friends with kids, and they are just getting by. Barely floating above water. 

I am currently working, and it's incredible how much money I have been able to save up. After all of my bills, I am paying approximately $2200 CAD a month. Since everything is closed now, I'm spending around $1800. I have my own car and live alone in an apartment. 

Right now I'm just investing lots of my extra money into stocks. 

Sometimes it pays to be undesirable!
