Figured out too late I hate my major
I'm 24 and graduating with my BA this December. I don't like my major but by time I figured that out I felt like it was too late to switch. I don't like any potentional careers in my chosen field and can't see myself happy doing any of them. I've been thinking about going to a trade school once I graduated because my other great fear is that I'll have a degree and still be serving tables. I figure if I have a trade at least I will have something while I figure out if I want to get a Masters or go for another bachelors. No matter what it's more time and money and student loan debt for me. So that's what's bothering me.
