SENATOR KANE: I'm sure we all agree with our esteemed colleague. Now, Mr. Corleone, you have been advised as to your legal rights. We have had testimony from a preceding witness who states you are head of the most powerful Mafia family in this country. Are you?
MICHAEL: No.
SENATOR KANE: This witness has testified that you are personally responsible for the murder of a New York Police Captain in the year 1947 and with him a man named Virgil Sollozzo. Do you deny this?
MICHAEL: I deny his every charge.
SENATOR KANE: Is it true that in the year 1950 you devised the murder of the heads of the Five Families in New York, to assume and consolidate your nefarious power?
MICHAEL: That is a complete falsehood.
SENATOR KANE: Is it true that you own a controlling interest in three of the major hotels in Las Vegas?
MICHAEL: That is not true. I own some stock in some of the hotels, but only very small amounts. I also own some American Telephone and IBM stock.
