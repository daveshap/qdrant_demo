SISSY: What was that?
CHINK: Clockworks.
SISSY: Clockworks?
CHINK: The Clockworks is one reason that I am here on Siwash Ridge. I accepted the invitation to be initiated as a shaman by an aged Siwash chief who was the principle outside confederate of the Clock People.
SISSY: Siwash, huh?
CHINK: He was a degenerated warlock who could turn urine into beer, and the honor that he extended me gave me rights of occupancy in this sacred cave on this far-away Siwash Ridge. I came to the Dakota hills to construct a clockworks of my own.
CHINK: But unlike the clockworks of the Clock People, my ticks more accurately echo the ticks of the universe.... ......ha ha ho ho and hee hee.
SISSY: The Clock People?
CHINK: During the Second World War I busted out of Tule Lake detention camp; as a Japanese-American, I had been put there and watched over. I found refuge with the Clock People, who discovered me in a snow bank, near dead, I had been climbing across the Sierra Nevada mountains.
SISSY: Then if you are Japanese, then why are you called the Chink?
CHINK: The Clock People mistook me for Chinese. And the name stuck. In the same way that all Indian tribes came to be labeled Indians" through the ignorance of an Italian sailor with a taste for oranges
