DR. TOWLER: Thank you. When Debby...
CONCANNON: Dr. Towler, who was in the operating room with you?
DR. TOWLER: Ms. Nevins, nurse-anesthetist; Dr. Marx, of course...
DR. TOWLER: Mary Rooney, the obstetrical nurse...
CONCANNON: What did these people do when her heart stopped?
DR. TOWLER: We went to Code Blue...
CONCANNON: 'Code Blue,' what does that mean...?
DR. TOWLER: It's a common medical expression, it's a crash program to restore the heartbeat. Dr. Marx cut an airway in her trachea, to get her oxygen, her and the baby... Ms. Nevins...
CONCANNON: Why wasn't she getting oxygen...?
DR. TOWLER: Well, many reasons, actually...
CONCANNON: Tell me one?
DR. TOWLER: She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask...
CONCANNON: She THREW UP IN HER MASK. Let's cut the bullshit. Say it: She THREW UP IN HER MASK.
