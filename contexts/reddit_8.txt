If you need advice I’ve got some for you
If your a teen and want some key advice about young I’ve got you covered 

Life is way too short and being a teenager doesn’t last long in life and you only have only life to live,so live it your best don’t make regrets with your life and do what you want in life because your on this planet for a reason and nothing can stop that.go with what you think is right and go follow your dreams cause literally anything is possible if you try hard enough 

LOVE:
If you fancy someone but your afraid/shy to tell them 
The best advice I can give you is tell them how you feel and go with your gut,because chances are they might truly like you too and is in the same boat as you they might be thinking “how do I tell him how I feel?”
And if it does go wrong which it probably wont but if it does I do too know how it feels to be rejected or if the person doesn’t feel the same way about you it hurts and there nothing you can do and you can’t make people like you or love you and I wish it did too but love isn’t about grand gestures or destiny it’s dumb luck and sometimes you find someone who feels the same about you and sometimes your unlucky but someday it could be tomorrow or next week or next month but when that tome comes your gonna find someone who feels the same way and appreciates who you are there’s like 7 billion people on this planet there’s so many opportunities out there you’ve just got to go get it.LOVE FINDS A WAY AND ITS WORTH THE WAIT IF IT TAKES LONG

FAMILY:
Family Is all you’ve got,there your blood and they’d do anything for you they’d be there at your best and worst times they’d been there since the day were born. Appreciate every second your with them because you never know when there gonna go.spend every second like it’s the last and family is one of the most important things you will want in life because they’re always there when you need. 


KINDNESS:
Always be kind because It does make the world go round. If your nice to someone the chances are you’d put them in a happy mood and might encourage them to be kind to someone else. There’s already too much hatred in this world and there’s no need for your anger and hatred too because you’d be making this world corrupt.Being kind to someone comes along way even just a small compliment to someone can the world a better place
