YU: You write gracefully. Calligraphy is so similar to fencing.
JEN: Maybe it is. I wouldn't know.
JEN: Please.
YU: Thank you for seeing me. I hear your wedding day is near. You must be overwhelmed by the preparations.
JEN: I'm hardly doing a thing. The less I think of it the better. My parents are arranging everything. The Gous are a very powerful family. My marrying one will be good for my father's career.
YU: You are fornuate to marry into such a noble family.
JEN: Am I? I wish I were like the heroes in the books I read. Like you and Li Mu Bai. I guess I'm happy to be marrying. But to be free to live my own life, to choose whom I love... That is true happiness.
YU: Do you think so? Let me tell you a story.
JEN: About you and Li Mu Bai?
YU: Yes. Did you know I was once engaged to be married?
JEN: No, really?
YU: His name was Meng Si Zhao. He was a brother to Li Mu Bai by oath. One day, while in battle, he was killed by the sword of Li Mu Bai's enemy. After, Li Mu Bai and I went through a lot together. Our feelings for each other grew stronger. But how could we dishonor Meng's memory? So the freedom you talk about, I too desire it. But I have never tasted it.
JEN: Too bad for Meng, but it's not your fault, or Li Mu Bai's.
YU: I am not an aristocrat, as you are... but I must still respect a woman's duties.
JEN: Don't distance us. From now on, let's be like sisters.
YU: Then as a sister, let me wish you happiness in your marriage.
