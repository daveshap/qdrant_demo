I can’t be the only one struggling to title my thesis, right??
I know this is a relatively mundane issue in the grand scheme of things but I dunno man. Just wondering how other people picked their titles. 

My thesis is mixed methods, and also interdisciplinary. I use topics in linguistics, psychology, sociology, public health and identity studies to inform my research. It’s split into two parts, one where I propose a theoretical framework, and a second where I conduct a study to address the first problem the framework recognizes as needing to be addressed. 

And none of the title I come up with feel like they’re good. Either they’re too long, too short, don’t emphasize linguistics enough, don’t emphasize my framework enough. Just a headache!! 

Please tell me I’m not alone.
