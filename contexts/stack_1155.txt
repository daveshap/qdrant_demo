Does Azure SQL Data Sync support MySQL or SQLExpress? I did see that it supports SQL Server (2005 and later) but does it support syncing between a SQLExpress server or MySQL server and an Azure Server?I'm trying to use it with a SQLExpress server but it isn't connecting. Is this because it's not supported?The error I'm getting when trying to connect with SQL Data Sync 2.0 on my server computer is: Unable to connect to the Database. Please check if service account has connectivity, credentials, and permissions to connect.I've opened up port 1433 in the firewall and can connect to the server via SSMS. However, the SQL Data Sync 2.0 application won't connect.I'll be trying this with a MySQL server later as well so I just wanted to know if it's supported or not as well.
