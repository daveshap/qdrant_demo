I just got a job and would like to give back.
So I was recently hired for a position utilizing my sciencey background, engineering and math and I graduated last year, but it took until now for me to find a job.

Here are some of the facts that I learned while adventuring as I see it.

* Being unemployed does not mean you do not have a job. To the contrary, your job is to find a job, three applications a day is more than enough. While on this train of thought, it is important to apply to jobs that you want to do, if you think you will be unhappy and you get an interview it will likely show through. If you are in dire need of a job, take anything, help neighbors (not necessarily for pay because it is a good thing), and stay positive.

* If you can still rely upon your parents for support do so. This allows you to focus more time on your job search because well you want to get out and be on your own. For me, I was living with my mother in section 8 housing and she didn't have internet but the local library had free wifi and it was a seven minute walk. Thus, I would go to the library for work and keeping tabs on news, not for videos or other things.

* Network. Yes I know that this is beaten in your head, but my concept of networking involves using friends and family as well as personal connections, but not to acquire a job, but to ask them if they know anyone who might know anything. This does several things, it avoids placing them into an awkward situation for them to say no if you were to ask them for a job, it informs them that you are seeking and the field in which you are seeking, it casts your net wider.

* Resumes ideally should be at most one page. As always there are exceptions, but in my instance I kept mine at a page until last October when my article was published which meant adding three lines to a full, not stuffed, page. Prior to this I had messed with formatting, awards were in two columns, and font size was 11. With the publication, I changed the font size to 12 and made the award list into a single column. I also lead with my education and grade point, I am proud of mine so I display it, followed by experience and I believe that 3 is ideal and you do not need to show continuous employment. When it comes to an objective, I am a little torn it really depends on your experience and what you are looking for, some of my resumes had it some did not, this was the only piece of my resume which was customized but only by field.

* Cover Letters: I originally started off with one generic cover letter for engineering and this got me one or two nibbles but was not the way to go. My cover letters were far more effective when I had them targeted toward field, such as engineering, modeling, analyst. One page is again what I strove for, the HR person or recruiter does not have that much time on his hands so shorter is better. Also I was never good at plugging in keywords, there is an art to this that I did not master.

* Preparation. Should you have an interview there are a few tips that saved me. When the recruiter/HR gives you a call out of the blue they will usually announce whom they are and the company, this is a great time to say, "Hey, now is not a great time to talk can we talk tomorrow at 3?" A recruiter would love nothing better than to catch you unawares, this gives you time to prepare while also demonstrating that you can think on your feet. For your interviews, I know we all spend far too much time on Reddit/Internet... Interviews are like final exams, there are people who can ace them without studying but the vast majority of us plebians need to study and prepare. Each interview is different but first ones are usually screening interviews, don't close any doors like relocating, and know details about company and position. Second interviews can be behavioral/situational, this means much more preparation, I probably prepared for about twelve hours the week prior for the job I was just offered. In person interviews can be an entirely separate can of worms, prepare some more. At the end of my interview process I probably had 7 pages of situational questions and responses and 2 pages of questions that I was ready to ask. A good tactic is to ask about their experiences and get them to talk about their life. Everyone's favorite topic is yours truly.

* How I was hired... I networked. A friend's parent is an executive at the company, but this only got me past the first screening stage, and even then I had to stay flexible in my responses, no closing doors. I remember seeing stats about referrals that those who are referred have a 50x higher chance of being hired, this is where the network comes in, they can't help you if they don't know you are looking or what you are looking for. For the final interview, I was able to have a conversation, not an interrogation, and I asked more questions of the interviewer than they did of me. I asked about what they enjoyed and how they adapted and got them to talk about their experiences.
