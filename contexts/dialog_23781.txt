JACK: Shut up. Here's to a great week.
MILES: Yes. Absolutely. Despite your crass behavior, I'm really glad we're finally getting this time together.
JACK: Yeah.
MILES: You know how long I've been begging to take you on the wine tour. I was beginning to think it was never going to happen.
JACK: Oh, that's tasty.
MILES: 100% Pinot Noir. Single vineyard. They don't even make it anymore.
JACK: Pinot Noir? How come it's white? Doesn't noir mean dark?
MILES: Jesus. Don't ask questions like that up in the wine country. They'll think you're a moron.
JACK: Just tell me.
MILES: Color in the red wines comes from the skins. This juice is free run, so there's no skin contact in the fermentation, ergo no color.
JACK: Sure is tasty.
MILES: Did you read the latest draft, by the way?
JACK: Oh, yeah. Yeah.
MILES: And?
JACK: I liked it a lot. A lot of improvements. It just seemed overall, I don't know, tighter, more... congealed or something.
MILES: How about the new ending? Did you like that?
JACK: Oh yeah. Much better.
MILES: There is no new ending. Page 750 on is exactly the same.
JACK: Well, then I guess it must have felt new because everything leading up to it was so different.
JACK: It's Christine. Hey you.
CHRISTINE: You guys having fun?
JACK: Yeah. All twenty minutes so far have been a blast.
CHRISTINE: Good. That's good.
JACK: So what's up?
CHRISTINE: Just seeing how you're doing. And, um, Mom and I were starting to look over the seating charts again, and we're wondering if you wanted Tony Levin to sit next to the Feldmans, or should he be at one of the singles tables?
