I can’t enjoy the things I used to like
I don’t know what happened. I’m 17f and I suddenly stopped liking music and watching movies and TV shows recently. I don’t really have any motivation to do anything. Before, I would try to finish all my schoolwork so that I could listen to music and watch stuff without any stress. I never felt this way until my senior year in high school. 

I don’t know if this was built up due to stress, fatigue, and my age or if this change was just sudden. The reason I mentioned my age and gender was because I think these things played a role in how I feel right now. I don’t mean to be TMI but ever since I had my period, I’ve felt some type of depression. I thought it was some hormonal imbalance and that it would go away but I’m not sure. Right now, it’s hard to recover. I’m still always tired and unmotivated. I want to rest still but I can’t due to school. I haven’t had the healthiest lifestyle. I think I was sleep deprived, my diet didn’t have a lot of protein, and I rarely exercise.  

The only thing I want is to feel the way I used to before. I don’t know if how I feel right now is temporary or permanent. I hope I don’t need medication. Thank you to anyone who reads this.
