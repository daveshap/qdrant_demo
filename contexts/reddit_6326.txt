Feedback at new jobs?
I've been at my new job for about a month and have barely gotten any feedback besides my boss telling me she really likes how autonomous I am, and occasionally saying "good job" when I complete a task (maybe 2-3 times). Is that level of feedback normal for this stage of the game or should I be worried because she's not saying more? I am about to go on a trip overseas for 2 weeks (it was already planned before I got this job and I disclosed it in the interview so it's not a problem) and plan to ask her about my performance so far when I return, but in the meantime I'd really like to know what the norm for the first month is.

(Edit: I don't have any reason to think I'm in trouble or have done anything badly (other than taking longer than I would have liked to complete a task one day, but she didn't say anything about it), but at my last job I was told I was doing well for a while until the story very suddenly changed, so I'm paranoid for any sign that I may need to be concerned.)
