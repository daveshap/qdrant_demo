I quit my job last week and now I’m regretting it. Advice?

I’ve been a Medical Assistant for 10 years. Just moved to another state with my husband after a lifetime of living in CA. It’s been a difficult adjustment especially with Covid going on and to top it off, my mom was diagnosed with cancer and started chemo in the midst of us moving. 

I began my new job at an Internal Medicine office 2 weeks after arriving to our new place and long story short, the job wasn’t what I expected. I hated it. I remember I would cry almost everyday due to the stress and anxiety I felt just thinking about going to work. Not to mention the constant worry I felt for my mom. So last week, I decided to quit. Luckily my husband is working so I know we’ll have a roof over our head these upcoming months but, I feel so guilty for leaving a well-paying job while people are losing their jobs left and right. 

To be honest, the medical field was never something I wanted to do. I quit this job hoping to change careers completely. The downside is, the future doesn’t look too bright as far as the economy goes. Although I absolutely hated that job, I feel like a should’ve stuck to it even if it meant putting my mental health in the back burner for a while. Everything just happened so fast. Any advice?
