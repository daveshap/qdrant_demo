JACK: Don't worry.
BELLA: Jack. Do you need a ride?
JACK: No. Thanks.
BELLA: My car's in the garage.
JACK: Maybe another time.
BELLA: I'll take you up on that.
JACK: Goodnight.
MAN: You don't recognise me? You had me barred. You fucking little worm.
JACK: Wait a minute. You got yourself barred.
MAN: It was you, you shit.
