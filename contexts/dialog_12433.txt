FRANK: A long time.
JULIA: You promised me an explanation.
FRANK: This is what began it.
JULIA: A box?
FRANK: It's not any box. It's called the Lament Configuration. It's a puzzle.
JULIA: Let me see.
FRANK: Don't touch it. It's dangerous. It opens doors.
JULIA: What kind of doors?
FRANK: To experience beyond anything ever known. At least that's what I was promised when I bought it. Pleasure from Heaven or Hell. I didn't much care which.
JULIA: Hell...
FRANK: I was bored. I'd done everything. I'd gone to the limits. There was nothing left to experience. At least nothing I could buy on earth.
JULIA: And you came back here to solve the puzzle --
FRANK: Sure. Somewhere safe. Safe. Christ! They tortured me here. In this room.
JULIA: Who did?
FRANK: The Cenobites. The creatures the box set free. Sometimes I think they're still here. Just behind the walls. Them and their hooks and their beasts. Just waiting to break out again. Except that I've got the box.
JULIA: You're still afraid.
FRANK: You would be. They tore me apart.
JULIA: So you were cheated.
FRANK: No. They gave me experiences beyond the limits. Pain and pleasure, indivisible.
FRANK: They took my body, but my spirit... they left that here. In the boards, in the walls. Watching the world, but not able to TOUCH it.
JULIA: And the blood let you out?
FRANK: It gave me a little chance, and I took it. They won't get me back. I'm going to live, and you're going to help me. Yes?
JULIA: Yes. They'll never find us.
