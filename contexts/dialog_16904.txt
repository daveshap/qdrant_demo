RAYBURN: You got a secondary search and you had a gun.
CREASY: Listen it was a calculated risk. I've done it a million times and never got caught.
RAYBURN: Everything happens once if you live long enough.
CREASY: It doesn't make sense to x-ray your bags coming off the plane.
RAYBURN: This is Mexico, they do everything backwards.
RAYBURN: So what's wrong?
CREASY: Nothing wrong.
RAYBURN: Don't give me that bullshit.
CREASY: So how's business?
RAYBURN: Japanese are here in a big way. Cheap labor. Factory space. But they feel a lot safer living over the border in El Paso. I ferry 'em back and forth. They think I'm John-fucking- Wayne.
CREASY: But don't you stay in El Paso?
RAYBURN: Fuck, I love Mexico. I live like a king down here.
CREASY: Yeah, right...
RAYBURN: Oh, like you haven't been in worse places.
CREASY: And a level five shithole is better than a level six. Your logic's inescapable.
RAYBURN: You been working?
CREASY: Not for eight months. I was in Columbia looking around, but, nothing seemed interesting.
RAYBURN: How long you staying, Crease?
CREASY: Got no plans, Rayburn, Nothing on. Just wanted to see you, how you were. Came by on impulse.
RAYBURN: You did something on impulse?
CREASY: Everything happens once if you live long enough.
