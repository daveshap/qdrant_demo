Difficult Sports Decision
I'm a sophomore in high school and I've been struggling with a tough decision for a few months now.

I haven't played school sports until this year, and I picked up running cross country and track and field. Since I started in late August, I have progressed from pretty awful, to the point where I am competing at varsity meets. I show lots of future potential (I seriously have improved a lot, which I am happy with). The high school I go to is top 3 for running in the entire state, which is already a competitive one, and I just made varsity. At this particular school, those who run are *somewhat* obligated to run all three seasons, meaning cross country and both track seasons. My coach is quite pleased with how I've improved, and my parents are off the walls about running this and running that since I have gotten pretty good, and no one ever really thought of me as that great of an athlete. So, physically speaking, my life is dedicated at the moment to continue improving as a runner.

Additionally, I have high hopes for the future which aren't running related, and involve me showing that I can be a good athlete. Hence, I need one or more varsity letters to apply to specific colleges.

So the thing is, over the course of this year I have gotten to the point where I just about hate running. I've lost 10 pounds while trying to maintain my weight (I didn't really have any weight to lose and I wasn't half-assing my effort to stay the same size, either), I have gotten weaker, and I feel like a pussy for it. It sounds stupid, but for the longest time I have absolutely loved lifting weights and training my physique. At this point, I know for a fact that I could continue where I am going, but I will genuinely hate the way I am; a sacrifice to be an elite-level runner. I have decided personally that it's just not worth it, and I want to finish this outdoor track season, but I don't want to run cross country. And after that: I would like to do wrestling in the winter.

My school has a great wrestling program, and I have always wanted to try wrestling, but I haven't done it before. The coach is notorious for being a tough guy with tougher workouts, and that's what I would want to do more than anything: a combative sport where I can get stronger, instead of a sport that I am good at but hate doing. I have spoken to people on the team and they all said, for what word of mouth is worth, that I would make the team since I'm a pretty small guy (118 lbs and 5'6) but am strong and lean.

&#x200B;

I have no idea how to really tell my parents that running isn't something that I am invested in anymore, and on top of that, I want to start something brand new. I think I want to wait until after the track season to tell them (so in mid-may). 

&#x200B;

Any advice on, if you can tell, I made the right decision: Do what I want to do, not what I am good at but dislike? And any advice on how to break it to my parents who won't shut up about my future in running? P.S. they are pretty supportive of any decisions, but I have never dropped a bomb like this before.
