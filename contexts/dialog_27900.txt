ESTHER: Mordechai?
HAMMER: Yes Esther.
ESTHER: I want you to talk dirty to me.
HAMMER: Oh. Okay.
HAMMER: I want for our children to go to private schools and take music lessons. Little Abraham will go to Stanford for college, Batya will go Ivy League, maybe Vassar.
ESTHER: Keep going.
HAMMER: Afterwards they'll make the decision as to whether or not they'd like to continue their religious studies in Israel. Because, hey, after all we'll have practiced the highly effective assertive democratic style of child rearing, sprinkled with a healthy dose of liberalism.
