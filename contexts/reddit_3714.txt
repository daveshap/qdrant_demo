The height thing
The general thing on reddit seems to be that a lot of men have issues when women ask about their height, because apparently that's a selection criteria for some women and they only want tall men.

I can imagine it being frustrating. 

But men seem to portray it as if height 'discrimination' is a thing only women do.

I'm 180cm, so I'm a tall woman. I don't discriminate in height, most of my boyfriends were shorter than me. 

But I lost count of how many men in OLD have told me that I'm just good to fuck because of my height, but not relationship material. That I'm a really interesting person and attractive but they can't have a girlfriend who is taller than them or would be taller than them with high heels on. Then they wouldn't look 'man' enough.. 

So, if it could be of any consolation, the discrimination goes both ways. :) 

And to be honest, I don't even care that much. I want a confident boyfriend, someone who isn't superficial or has a fragile ego. So my height is already a good filter to help filter part of the fragile egos out. And I assume it's also the other way around. Why, as a man, would you want a women who places so much value on something as your height?
