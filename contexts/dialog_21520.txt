BIALYSTOCK: Assume away!
BLOOM: Well, it's very easy. You simply raise more money than you really need.
BIALYSTOCK: What do you mean?
BLOOM: You've done it yourself, only you did it on a very small scale.
BIALYSTOCK: What did I do?
BLOOM: You raised two thousand more than you needed to produce your last play.
BIALYSTOCK: So what? What did it get me? I'm wearing a cardboard belt.
BLOOM: Ahhhhhh! But that's where you made your error. You didn't go all the way. You see, if you were really a bold criminal, you could have raised a million.
BIALYSTOCK: But the play only cost $60,000 to produce.
BLOOM: Exactly. And how long did it run?
BIALYSTOCK: One night.
BLOOM: See? You could have raised a million dollars, put on a sixty thousand dollar flop and kept the rest.
BIALYSTOCK: But what if the play was a hit?
BLOOM: Oh, you'd go to jail. If the play were a hit, you'd have to pay off the backers, and with so many backers there could never be enough profits to go around, get it?
BIALYSTOCK: Aha, aha, aha, aha, aha, aha!! So, in order for the scheme to work, we'd have to find a sure fire flop.
BLOOM: What scheme?
BIALYSTOCK: What scheme? Your scheme, you bloody little genius.
BLOOM: Oh, no. No. No. I meant no scheme. I merely posed a little, academic accounting theory. It's just a thought.
BIALYSTOCK: Bloom, worlds are turned on such thoughts!
