Canada Election Night Megathread
*Omnes una manet nox - The same night awaits us all.*

**Liberal minority projected**

Happy election day!

Today is election day in Canada, with voters going to the polls to elect 338 members of Parliament across the country.  Each member is elected in a first past the post election from a single district called a "riding."^1

Incumbent Prime Minister Justin Trudeau (Liberal) faces Conservative leader Andrew Scheer, as well as NDP leader Jagmeet Singh, Green leader Elizabeth May, Bloc Québécois leader Yves-François Blanchet, and the new People's Party leader Maxime Bernier.

Polls have now closed across Canada.

For those not up on Canadian geography and wondering "Does Canada really span 6 time zones?" Yes, [Canada is really big.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhiDILWFXBE)


[Polls have forecast that it is most likely no party will win a majority of the seats in Parliament.](https://newsinteractives.cbc.ca/elections/poll-tracker/canada/)  

In that event, there may be significant political jockeying over who can successfully hold the Prime Minister's office.

If you want a very detailed view of the law around forming government,^2 [this article from Professor Philippe Lagassé is an excellent overview.](https://journals.library.ualberta.ca/constitutional_forum/index.php/constitutional_forum/article/view/29384/21386)

As the night goes on, I may refer back to that piece in discussing government formation and minority or coalition government scenarios.

Once polls start closing I will begin a tick tock with results and other relevant news.

**4:32 PM EDT** Re: some questions in the comments, I am gonna talk a little bit about how things work in a minority government situation.

* As incumbent Prime Minister, Trudeau remains in office until and unless he resigns or is dismissed by the Governor General (GG) (Lagassé p. 6).

* There is a custom, not rule, that the party with the most seats will usually serve as the government.  If Trudeau's Liberals do not have the most seats, and he follows this custom, he would resign to allow the party with the most seats to form government. (Lagassé p. 11)

* If Trudeau does not resign as PM, when Parliament reconvenes, he will face a vote to test [whether he has the confidence of the Commons](https://www.ourcommons.ca/About/ProcedureAndPractice3rdEdition/ch_02_2-e.html) (the vote on the address in reply to the speech from the throne).

* If Trudeau passes that vote, he stays as PM.

* If Trudeau fails that vote, he could either resign, or advise the Governor General to call a snap election.

* If Trudeau resigned after losing confidence, the GG would choose the person the GG thought most likely to hold the confidence of the Commons, by practice the leader of the opposition is that person. (Lagassé p. 8)

* If Trudeau advised a snap election after losing confidence, the GG would decide whether she thought there was another viable government.  

 * If she thinks another viable government exists, she would refuse Trudeau's advice, and appoint an alternate government.  Trudeau would be forced to resign, or be formally dismissed if he did not resign. (Lagassé p. 6)

 * If she thinks another viable government does not exist, she would agree to the advice, dissolve Parliament, and call a snap election.  Trudeau would remain PM through such a snap election. (Lagassé p. 8)

**6:35 PM EDT** Added some live stream links up top.

**7:00 PM EDT** Polls are now closed in Newfoundland and Labrador.

**7:20 PM EDT**  Liberals leading in 3 ridings that have results so far - all ridings they are expected to win.

**7:30 PM EDT** Polls closed in the maritime provinces now.  Will have a 2 hour wait from now until we get the big poll closing for QC/ON/MB/SK/AB/Territories.

**7:44 PM EDT Lib:2** Two seats called in Newfoundland for the Liberals, in seats they were pretty comfortably expected to hold.  Conservatives not leading in many seats but seem to be improving on 2015 in raw vote counts so far.

**8:00 PM EDT Lib: 5**  Lot of seats in NS and NB where conservatives are looking good, but very few votes in so far.  NDP looks likely to get a flip in Saint John's East.

**8:23 PM EDT Lib: 8; NDP: 1** First flip of the night.  NDP has taken Saint John's East from the Liberals.  Conservatives are leading in 6 seats (all previously Liberal) but have not gotten any of them called for them.  About an hour still until we get the giant polls close from all of Canada except BC, so will be lots more parsing Atlantic Canada for a while yet.

**8:41 PM EDT Lib 12; Con 2; NDP 1**  Conservatives have their first flips of the night, both in New Brunswick along the Maine border.  Leading in a few more in NB, lots of very close races there, as well as a few close ones in NS.

**8:45 PM EDT Lib 14; Con 2; NDP 1** Greens are now leading in Fredericton but not elected there yet.  Conservatives in 2nd there right now. 

**9:06 PM EDT Lib 18; Con 3; NDP 1** Added a French stream from TVA above.  Also interesting we have some votes from Gaspe area because of the time zone.  Liberal incumbent leading the Bloc candidate by a little bit, but not much in yet.

**9:26 PM EDT Lib 19; Con 3; NDP 1**  Ok just before the huge polls close, looks like the Liberals are decently positioned to hold a plurality.  Will be interesting how much the Bloc can take both from the other 3 parties with QC seats in the overall balance of power.  They are now leading in the Gaspe seat.  This will be a long night.

**9:30 PM EDT Lib 20; Con 3; NDP 1**  Okay, here we go!  Big poll close time.

**9:40 PM EDT Lib 20; Con 4; NDP 1** I'm only saying called seats, but Liberals are leading in a lot of spots.  Bloc not getting too many leads.  Bernier of the People's Party looks to be getting his seat. 

**9:44 PM EDT Lib 21; Con 4; NDP 1**  One GTA suburbs seat with meaningful vote in, going well for the Liberals.  If they perform like this in the rest of the Toronto area, Justin Trudeau will have a very good night.

**9:47 PM EDT Lib 21; Con 4; NDP 1** And now they're behind in that seat... so things are swinging a lot.  Bernier is also now behind in his seat.

**9:53 PM EDT Lib 21; Con 4; NDP 1** Looks like the Bloc and Liberals are cutting up Quebec between them, which is pretty good for the Liberals, and a (mostly expected) disaster for the NDP.

**9:58 PM EDT Lib 22; Con 4; NDP 1**  Liberals are leading in 94 seats and are only seeing a net swing of -6 so far, which is really strong for them, since they could lose about 16 and still have a majority.

**10:00 PM EDT Lib 22; Con 4; NDP 1**  Polls are now closed across Canada.

**10:05 PM EDT Lib 22; Con 4; NDP 1** Looks like the Liberals are leading in a lot of GTA seats, seems like all of the seats in Mississauga and Brampton so far are red, as well as the center Toronto seats.  Couple of seats up by Vaughan with a Conservative lead.

**10:10 PM EDT**  **CBC is projecting a Liberal government** (though probably more fair to say Liberal plurality).

**10:15 PM EDT Lib 23; Con 8; NDP 1**  Based on leads, Liberals are losing about net 20 seats, and probably on track to lose some more which would put them into minority government territory.

**10:23 PM EDT  Lib 26; Con 19; BQ 2; NDP 1**  Liberal minority government projected, big question will be whether Liberal+NDP will make it to 170.  Right now they are just at that line with leading + elected.  150 Liberal leading+elected, 20 NDP leading+ elected.

**10:39 PM EDT Lib 52; Con 58; BQ 10; NDP 1** Despite Conservative lead in locked-up seats, Liberals still leading in plenty more.  Looks like all the party leaders on track to hold their seats.

**10:50 PM EDT Lib 77; Con 73; BQ 18; NDP 2** I was mistaken about all the leaders keeping their seats.  Bernier is defeated, and the PPC is getting very little traction.  Trudeau and Scheer have won their seats.  May is leading in her seat, as is Singh (though Singh is only up by a few percent).

**11:02 PM EDT Lib 100; Con 85; BQ 22; NDP 6; Grn 1** Interestingly, the Liberals are likely to be in government despite getting less popular vote than the Conservatives, though extremely close right now.  33.8% Liberal, 33.9% Conservative.  Definitely the Liberals are seeing big vote efficiency advantages, with Alberta especially having some huge blowout ridings where the Conservatives do not get much of any advantage by winning by 50+%.

**11:15 PM EDT Lib 110; Con 95; BQ 25; NDP 9; Grn 1**  Looks like based on leading+elected that the Liberals would only need the support of one of the NDP or Bloc to have a working majority, so that gives them several paths to keeping confidence of the Commons (seems by far most likely they'd do that through the NDP).

**11:24 PM EDT Lib 114; Con 97; BQ 26; NDP 9; Grn 2** Greens look to be getting about 4 seats tonight, which would be by far their best haul ever.  

We also are looking at a pretty definite popular vote / seat count split, with the Liberals now 0.6% behind the Conservatives in raw vote, but far ahead in seat count.

**11:28 PM EDT Lib 115; Con 100; BQ 26; NDP 9; Grn 2**  Liberals are going to be locked out of having any seats in Alberta and probably Saskatchewan, which could be a problem for regional divisions.

**11:40 PM EDT  Lib 120; Con 106; BQ 26; NDP 11; Grn 2**  Going to end the tick tock here.  Results of the night seem pretty clear.  Biggest remaining question seems to be whether Scheer remains conservative leader.

^1 I do not know why Canadian electoral districts are called "ridings" in English.  Anyone have a good source on that?

^2 For readers not used to Westminster-style systems, "government" is used in the way "administration" would be used in the American context.  So the "Trudeau government" is the current administration in charge of Canada, consisting of PM Trudeau, his cabinet, and other senior political officials.  The term is not used here to mean the whole apparatus of the state, as it often would be in the US.
