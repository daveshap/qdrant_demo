GERSTENKORN: Goodbye, Preysing, I hope you pull through. This is a very bad time to be in such a crisis. We've...
PREYSING: Why talk -- it's over -- it's over -- it's finished. You've broken off negotiations. You did it. You're calling them off. You had nothing on your mind all day, but Manchester, -- Manchester -- Manchester. You don't suppose for one moment that I'm such a fool as not to have something that I could say definitely about Manchester.
GERSTENKORN: What?
PREYSING: Oh no -- no -- the session is over. Let's go, it's off. Thank you, gentlemen.
GERSTENKORN: If you actually have news from Manchester then...
PREYSING: Gentlemen, I am now free to announce... ...that the deal between my firm and the Manchester Cotton Company has been successfully negotiated.
GERSTENKORN: Preysing, you're joking with us.
SCHWEIMANN: You're a deep one.
GERSTENKORN: In that case give us the articles. We'll sign at once. We know all the details...
PREYSING: I thought we'd suspended negotiations, gentlemen.
GERSTENKORN: Under these circumstances it's quite a different matter.
PREYSING: Under these circumstances we might refuse to sign.
