How to match my skills with a job?
My skillset doesn't translate as well as I wish it did. I feel like I have a good range of experience, time in the military (enlisted) and a master's in international policy. Is there a place that can help me match jobs with my skillset, and find the entry level jobs I am qualified for?

I know networking is a lot of this, but having a better idea on what I am qualified for would at least be a step in the right direction and help me start a conversation.
