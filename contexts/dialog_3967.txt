ADAM: Okay, Troy! Let's get those all-beef frozen patties!
TROY: How 'bout we check with Eve first?
ADAM: You bet!
TROY: So, did you buy a movie?
ADAM: What?
TROY: A magazine? A toy perhaps? In the bookstore.
ADAM: No, I wouldn't go in one of those places with a gas mask on.
TROY: I know what you mean! I usually wear a big hat and dark glasses.
ADAM: Does that work?
TROY: Yeah...Seems to.
ADAM: Hi, Eve!
EVE: Hi, Adam. This is, uh....
ARON: I'm Nina Aron, Adam.
ADAM: How do you do?
ARON: Very well, thank you. I'm with the County Family Services Department. Eve tells me you've been living in a bomb shelter most of your life.
ADAM: Fallout shelter. There's a difference.
ARON: Adam, I'd like to introduce you to my associate -- Mr. Brown.
