Is leaving a job without another position lined up a death sentence to my career as a working professional?
I’m seriously considering quitting my job in the legal field without another lined up due to stress and its effect on my overall health. I’ve been hospitalized three times in the past year due to suicide attempts and ideation. There are a few things keeping me from quitting, however: 

1. I need the health insurance. My boss is a very nice person, and I think she would consider keeping me on the health insurance plan even if I quit as long as I pay the premium. There’s no guarantee though. I meet with her on Monday to discuss my employment and if I plan to come back. I might qualify for MA, but I’m not entirely sure how that process works. I’m unmarried and don’t really have any assets, just a car and $2500 in the bank. My boyfriend and I figured as a last resort, we could get married so I can be added to his health insurance plan. He’s definitely Mr. Right for me, we would just be doing things earlier than we might have wanted to.

2. I’m worried that not having a job while searching for a new one with severely impact the hunt in a negative way. My aunt thinks that this isn’t such a big deal since unemployment is low, but I’m not convinced. I might also continue my college education (a class or two, not full time) if I drop to full time. I’m halfway to my BA right now. 

3. I’m worried I will run out of savings before I can find anything. I have enough to cover 3 months of expenses. I have family that will ensure I don’t end up on the street, but I don’t want to take advantage of them.

Advice? Comments? Suggestions? Thanks in advance. I’m just tired of wanting to die. I’m not try to avoid work, honestly. I just want less stress, and I’d like to finish ElectroConvulsive Therapy and the day hospital before returning to work.
