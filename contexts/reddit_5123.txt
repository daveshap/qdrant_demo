Is it wrong to not respond to a rejection email?
I recently applied for a position and completed rounds of interviews for the position. I received an email from a recruiter with the company stating that I was not selected for the position.  Most rejections that I've received from companies were automated responses and weren't attached to a direct person, always signed "Company A HR". In this case, I interviewed with the recruiter and the same recruiter stuck with me throughout the entire process. FWIW, the email had the common speech given when rejecting a candidate, but it was signed by the recruiter. I'm really not sure if I should reply to the email. I honestly don't see a point in responding since my time with them is done, but I don't want to seem like an entitled brat for ghosting them after a rejection. I also don't see myself applying to the company in the future, if that has anything to do with it. What should I do?
