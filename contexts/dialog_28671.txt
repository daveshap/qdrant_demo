JAEGER: Oh, God! Oh God!
EPPS: Just be cool.
JAEGER: It's a mine, isn't it?
EPPS: Just relax.
JAEGER: How'm I gonna relax standing on a mine!?
EPPS: We're going to get off, all right. We'll get you off of there. Just...be cool.
JAEGER: Where you going?
EPPS: Me and Wes are just going to talk.
JAEGER: Why you got to move away to talk!?
EPPS: We're going to be right over here.
JAEGER: You're moving away because it's going to blow up, isn't it!? It's going to blow up!
EPPS: I said be cool, all right? Now be cool!
WES: What kind of mine?
EPPS: I don't know, and I wasn't about to mess with it.
WES: Should have blown already. Delayed fuse, that's Vietnam stuff.
EPPS: Maybe that's all the Iraqis could afford, okay? Maybe they got it on discount. Maybe the fuse is messed up. Or maybe it's going to go off in two seconds, and we won't have to worry about getting Jaeger down off there, all we'll have to worry about is finding the pieces.
JAEGER: Epps...
WES: Doesn't matter. We're not going to be able to get him off it anyway.
EPPS: There's a way.
JAEGER: Epps...
