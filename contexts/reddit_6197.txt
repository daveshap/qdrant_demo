Imposter Syndrome in new job
So I've recently gotten a management job despite not having much experience in the field (my boss is well aware of it). I've attempted to make a post on that industry's subreddit on how to train myself outside of work to supplement my boss's training and I've received 90% criticism on how I'd even gotten that job and how I should have at least 5 years experience to even try to apply for such job, and it has really demotivated me. Of course I'm going to make advances to try to better myself but that experience definitely gave me some form of imposter syndrome. I'm usually not one to succumb to stress or adversity, but what are y'alls advice/experiences of other people bringing your accomplishments down or people saying you don't deserve what you have?
