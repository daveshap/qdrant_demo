A quick note on phone use
This past weekend, my (23F) boyfriend (23M) of a few months and I went for a little getaway at my family's cabin, just the two of us. It was all wonderful, but what I want to point out as oddly amazing to me was how little he used his phone.
We got there and I grabbed his phone to take a picture, and I asked why his brightness was so low. He said it was because he forgot his charger, and I told him he should have said something when we swung by my place on our way out (our phones have different chargers, but I do have one that would have worked for him). He shrugged it off very casually and said "I don't plan on using it anyways, I'm here with you."
I didn't realize how sweet of a gesture it was until he said it. For the rest of the weekend we would go on a walk, for example, and he would never take his phone. He focused on me and us.

Just thought I'd share that those little things really prove you're paying attention and show where your priorities are!
