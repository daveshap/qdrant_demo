SAM: The point remains: we could be working for different people. There's a chance for one of us... Maybe more than one of us -- has been paid to cross the others. I don't know about you guys, but I like to know who I'm working for. It can help prevent a great deal of... ...unpleasantness.
LARRY: Anybody tries to unpleasant me I'll put two between his eyes -- one to do the job and the other to make sure it takes.
DEIRDRE: It's good to see you've all got such faith in our little undertaking.
LARRY: Who the fuck are you?
DEIRDRE: The name is Deirdre, and I'm running this show.
GREGOR: Who are you? IRA?
DEIRDRE: Not likely. Once, yeah, I was -- but there wasn't an inch of profit in it, and I'm a cash oriented girl, if you take my meaning. I'm a hired gun, same as the rest of you, and that's all any of us needs to know about the other.
DEIRDRE: From here on in you want something you pay cash for it: no credit cards, no bank accounts are in place: ten percent up front, the rest when the job is done. You. What do you do and what should we call you?
GREGOR: These days they they call me Gregor -- and I'm a tech. I do electronic work, surveillance, computer runs.
SAM: Sam. I'm a weapons guy.
DEIRDRE: You were a soldier, were you?
SAM: Once.
LARRY: I drive -- and my name is Larry. Larry from the States.
DEIRDRE: And who are you?
VINCENT: I'm Vincent. And I coordinate.
SAM: Coordinate what?
VINCENT: Things. This is my country, you know.
DEIRDRE: Coordinate all you want, but make sure whatever you do gets cleared through me. Are we in sync on this, Vincent?
VINCENT: Of course.
SWEDE: They call me Swede.
LARRY: Who's they?
SWEDE: Everybody.
