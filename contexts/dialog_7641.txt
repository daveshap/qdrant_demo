DR. THURMAN: Your medication. They're placebos. Just pills made out of water.
DONNIE: Thank you.
DR. THURMAN: Donald, an atheist is someone who denies altogether the existence of a God. You are an agnostic. An agnostic is someone who believes that there can be no proof of the existence of God... but does not deny the possibility that God exists.
DONNIE: Goodbye, Dr. Thurman.
DR. THURMAN: Goodbye, Donald.
ELIZABETH: I got in. I'm going to Harvard.
DONNIE: Congratulations.
DONNIE: Mom and Dad won't be back until Sunday night. It's Halloween Carnival. We should throw a party. We could totally get away with it.
ELIZABETH: Okay, but it has to be a small one.
DONNIE: Everything is going to be just fine.
SEAN: We got eggs, water balloons, and a dozen rolls of toilet paper.
RONALD: I stole four beers from my dad.
