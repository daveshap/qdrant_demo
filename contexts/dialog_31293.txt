PROFESSOR: Professor Marvel never guesses -- he knows! Now, why are you running away?
DOROTHY: Why --
PROFESSOR: No, no -- now don't tell me. They -- they don't understand you at home. They don't appreciate you. You want to see other lands -- big cities -- big mountains -- big oceans --
DOROTHY: Why, it's just like you could read what was inside of me.
PROFESSOR: Yes --
DOROTHY: Please, Professor, why can't we go along with you?
