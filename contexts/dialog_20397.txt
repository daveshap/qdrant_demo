FOLEY: Like being back in the yard, huh?
MAURICE: Just like it. Nobody backing down. You back down, you pussy. Tell me what you and Buddy doing up here in the cold?
FOLEY: Glenn didn't tell you?
GLENN: I thought you guys were busted.
FOLEY: Why? Just because you left us standing on the side of the road?
FOLEY: Look, Snoop, I don't know what Glenn promised you or what you think you're gonna get, but the deal is me and Buddy get half of whatever we take from Ripley, understand? How you and Glenn cut up the rest is up to you.
MAURICE: Let's go outside and talk.
FOLEY: What's the matter with right here? It's nice and warm.
MAURICE: Warm? Man, it's ninety-five degrees in here, sometimes a hundred -- the way Emanuel always kep' it so his boys'd sweat, get lean and mean like Tommy Hearns. No, I ain't talking any business in here. To me this is holy ground, man. You understand? I got to be someplace anyway. Y'all want to talk, come to the fights tomorrow night, we'll sit down and look at it good. The State Theater.
