DEANE: That's also where Mr. Barnes lost his arms to Mathew Grimes' booby— trap. What's your point, Dr. Carter?
MADISON: Letting a lunatic like Parker Barnes loose in the free world is like lighting a fuse. At some point, he will go off -- you saw what happened in the simulator. The risk to the public is unacceptably dangerous.
DEANE: Not if you're with him every step of the way.
MADISON: The man played judge, jury, and executioner with eight people's lives. He lost control and is capable of doing it again.
DEANE: I understand the risks involved here. But there is nobody better qualified to go after Sid 6.7 than Barnes. And, there is nobody who knows him better than you. If a situation becomes volatile, you will find a way to quell it. I have complete confidence in you.
PARKER: I don't need a baby—sitter.
MADISON: What you need is a collar.
COX: She's going to help you understand what makes Sid 6.7 tick.
PARKER: What she's going to do is get in my way.
COX: This is the personnel file on the programmer, Lindenmeyer. There might be something in it you can use.
PARKER: She wasn't part of the deal, Cox.
COX: Fine —— you want to stay here?
COX: Officers in Toluca Lake just found an affluent couple...completely gutted. So were the first two cops to arrive on scene.
PARKER: Their weapons missing?
COX: Sid 6.7 is now armed.
PARKER: Where's my gun?
