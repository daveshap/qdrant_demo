WENDY: Not right now, Daddy's asleep.
DANNY: I won't make any noise.
WENDY: Come on, Doc. He only went to bed a few hours ago. Can't you wait till later?
DANNY: I won't make a sound, I promise. I'll tip-toe.
WENDY: Well all right. But really don't make a sound.
DANNY: I won't, Mom.
WENDY: Make sure you come right back, 'cause I'm going to make lunch soon. Okay?

DANNY: Dad?
JACK: What?
DANNY: You wouldn't ever hurt Mummy and me, would you?
JACK: What do you mean?

JACK: Are you sure?
DANNY: Yes, Dad.
JACK: I love you, Danny. I love you more than anything else in the whole world, and I'd never do anything to hurt you, never... You know that, don't you, huh?
DANNY: Yes, Dad.
JACK: Good.
