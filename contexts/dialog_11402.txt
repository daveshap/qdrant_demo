MR. BRADDOCK: Why?
BEN: Well -- it's very comfortable -- just to drift here.
MR. BRADDOCK: Have you thought about graduate school?
BEN: No.
MR. BRADDOCK: Would you mind telling me then -- what were those four years of college for? What was the point of all that hard work?
BEN: You got me.
MR. BRADDOCK: Now listen, Ben. I think it's a very good thing that a young man -- after he's done some very good work -- should have a chance to relax and enjoy himself, and lie around, and drink beer and so on. But after a few weeks I believe that person would want to take some stock in himself and his situation and start to think about getting off his ass.
