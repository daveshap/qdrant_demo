PAUL: Them. They almost got us all killed. I have done enough for them! We cannot look after them anymore.
TATIANA: What are you going to do? You cannot drive them out onto the road. They can stay with me.
PAUL: What!
TATIANA: I will not have them on my conscience. They will stay in my room.
PAUL: Zozo, get a key for two staff bedrooms. Put these people in them.
