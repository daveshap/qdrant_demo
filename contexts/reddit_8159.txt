What evidence is there for the premise that privatization of public goods will reduce costs for the consumer?
For quite some time, there has been a debate between conservatives and liberals about the privatization of public goods such as [bridges, trains, metro system, etc](https://panampost.com/editor/2017/01/19/congress-privatize-washington-d-c-metro/).

There was a recently article in the New York Times about negative outcomes of [railway privatization in Britain](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/04/opinion/why-britains-trains-dont-run-on-time-capitalism.html?_r=0). What are other instances where privatization of public services has led to either positive or negative outcomes?

And -- probably the more interesting question -- what distinguishes the instances that have failed from the instances that have succeeded?

Is it universally the case that privatization will lead to reduced costs and improved services? Is there any basis for the claim that privatization is always better? Or are there considerations on a case-by-case basis that would determine whether privatization is favorable or not?
