COATES: It's okay, Kanita. Come on in.
KANITA: He looks like a cop.
COATES: He's not a cop, he's a medic. I'm CY Coates.
FRANK: Frank Pierce.
COATES: Mary said you might be coming.
FRANK: Where is she?
COATES: Sleeping in the back.
FRANK: She asked me to pick her up.
COATES: I know, but she told me to tell you she wants to crash here a few hours. Terrible about her father, isn't it?
FRANK: I better just go in and see her.
