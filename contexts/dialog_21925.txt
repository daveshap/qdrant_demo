MOTHER: Can't you answer? What's the matter with you anyhow?
FATHER: He's just loaded, honey.
MOTHER: I was talking to Jim.
FATHER: Let me just explain to you--we just moved here, y'understand? The kid has no friends yet and--
JIM: Tell him why we moved here.
FATHER: Hold it, Jim.
JIM: You can't protect me.
FATHER: You mind if I try? You have to slam the door in my face? I try to get to him--what happens? Don't I give you everything you want? A bicycle--you get a bicycle. A car--
JIM: You buy me many things. Thank you.
FATHER: Not just buy! You hear all this talk about not lovely your kids enough. We give you love and affection, don't we?
