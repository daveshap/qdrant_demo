How to remove temp tables from SQL Server? I want to remove temp tables that I was using in my script in SQL Server 2008. I can't find a way to remove it without writing a few lines of code. I have not been able to find code that works properly. Is there any way to do this without writing code at all? If not, what should be my approach? Will copying my code in a new script and then creating same name temp tables help? Any help/advice/suggestion much appreciated.
