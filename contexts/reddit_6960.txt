Company has a habit of laying off people without any warning and expecting it to not have an effect on morale, anyone else been in a similar workplace?
Iâ€™m in a company that has had a reputation for laying off people without much warning, Senior people and junior, whilst also claiming to have commitment towards growing the business and to the success of the team. Is this just a corporate line? How do you reconcile against the behaviour you see versus the words that are spoken?
