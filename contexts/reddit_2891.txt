Dealing with a passive aggressive colleague at new job is making me sick - help?
Another night since starting my new job where I am losing sleep at the thought of going in. I sit next to a colleague who has never been welcoming since the day I started despite me making the effort. The didn’t want to train me, made jokes at my expense and was just passive aggressive. Nice to everyone then when it came to me said colleague would have the stiffest face ever. Their behaviour influenced even the most junior members of staff who had zero respect or patience for me.

I’ve raised my colleagues behaviour 3 times now with my manager who agrees he is difficult. However our team head is very close with this difficult colleague and I don’t believe he is doing anything given they are close. First time I raised this the team head said to my manager they would wait until my difficult colleague raised the issue with him. That’s when I started applying for jobs (I send 3-5 a day). 

Needless to say that this colleague has a lot of social power and I’ve found settling in to this new team INCREDIBLY difficult and toxic. I dread going in at times and don’t know whether it’s best to quit and just job hunt after but it’s not so wise as I don’t have the financial means to do this. The last two months have been intense. Everything at work seems to be going wayward when I touch it or there is a problem when I do something that is out of my control but may create the perception to the masses it is me. 

I fucking hate this job and wish I never took it.

Edit: spoke to difficult colleague about it first time. I would’ve been a month in role. Said colleague admitted to their weird wats but said it wasn’t personal. Then admitted to my team manager they had received this feedback before with the colleague I replaced. Management are aware.
