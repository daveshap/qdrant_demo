Mid 1980s SF book with human colonists on a forest world Not the Mid World books or the LeGuin forest bookHuman colonists on a forest planet, want to be independent from EarthAuthor\u2019s first name might have been Christopher Planet was definitely outside this solar system- in fact, the story referenced that the human colonists had left the solar system after previously colonizing the outer planets.I don\u2019t remember any character names. Only character attribute I remember is the main antagonist, a very technocratic Earth admiral trying to assert control by force. No sex that I recall - I would have been 12-13 when I read. Tone was much more sci fi than fantasy; detailed descriptions of the Earth ships and the colonists\u2019 defenses. There were several battles.
