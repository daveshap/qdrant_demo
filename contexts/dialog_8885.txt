JACK: A gust of wind killed him.
FRANK: Yeah, and what put him up there?
JACK: Hey, you weren't there. Right?
FRANK: Look, can we forget last night? We gotta talk.
JACK: Talk.
FRANK: I been thinking maybe we should make some changes. I been thinking maybe we should take on a singer.
JACK: Sure, why not.
FRANK: It's just an idea. I want your opinion. I mean, we go halfway on everything, right?
JACK: It's more like 40-60, wouldn't you say?
FRANK: We agreed that if I took care of the business; I'd be entitled to the extra. Isn't that what we agreed?
JACK: That's what we agreed.
FRANK: If you're unhappy with the arrangement --
JACK: I'm not unhappy.
FRANK: If you'd like to assume more of the financial responsibilities, I'd be glad --
JACK: Frank. Fuck it. Okay?
FRANK: I've tried to do well by you, Jack. By both of us.
JACK: I'm grateful, Frank. How much? For the singer.
FRANK: I thought maybe twenty percent. Look, with the additional bookings we'll come out ahead. The big hotels, they want a pretty girl with a big voice. We have to stay competitive, Jack.
FRANK: What's that?
JACK: You, Frank. All these years you been telling me we're different. We got novelty, Jack. No one can touch us.
FRANK: Two pianos isn't enough anymore, Jack.
JACK: It never was.
