I JUST CALLED INTO A PIZZA PLACE!!!
I'm still shaking. Making phone calls gives me the biggest anxiety. I asked whether it's not too late to have it delivered into my area. Person said no but that I'd have it better to order it online anyway. So it was a shorter and less complicated phone call than I was preparing for but that doesn't change the fact that I did it! I dialed the fuck out of that number, fucking killed it!! EAT A DICK, ANXIETY.

Edit: I make a phone call and get my first gold in the same day?! This literally made my whole month. Your guys' support, advice and kind words on this post have been overwhelming. I did not expect it to blow up so much but I'm grateful it did. I'm so motivated and inspired by your words that I'm now less scared to push myself even further. Thank you all from the bottom of my heart.
