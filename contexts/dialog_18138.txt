PHELPS: Satisfied?
CLAIRE: All ten million.
PHELPS: Fold it. Fold it tight.
ETHAN: Arenít you going to thank me Jim. Ten million is better than six.
PHELPS: Donít flatter yourself - six was for <u>Eastern Europe</u>. You made a lousy deal - ten for the world? What is that? But I needed you for the transfer with Max. I got a little extra change; and you got a little extra too.
PHELPS: Sorry Ethan. Times up. Say goodbye.
ETHAN: Youíre wrong about one thing. Iím not the only one whoís seen you alive.
