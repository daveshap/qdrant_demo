Got my first engineering job any advice?
So basically I graduated few months ago and landed my very first job as an MEP inspector which I know nothing in terms of technical knowledge. First day was cool, getting to know the people setting up my station and what not. But I am skeptical about what's next?
  
So basically I know nothing, how should I approach it? What should I do to maximize my learning ? What type of questions should I ask the engineers, will they be bothered if I ask a lot?
  
I hear from my friends that the very first weeks they were given catalogues to read, project documents to read but is this the right way?
  
I am really afraid, appreciate any advice. Cheers
