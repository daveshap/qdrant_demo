GRUSINSKAYA: Always the performance -- every day the performance -- time for the performance. I think, Suzette, I have never been so tired in my life. Veronal didn't even help me to sleep.
SUZETTE: Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought.
GRUSINSKAYA: I can't dance tonight --
SUZETTE: It will pass -- it will pass -- come.
GRUSINSKAYA: Let us cancel the engagement.
SUZETTE: But, Madam. cannot do that.
GRUSINSKAYA: Now is the time to cancel to stop entirely. I feel it -- everything tells me -- enough -- enough.
