Possibility of getting back into previous career
Long time ago, I was in a career field I really enjoyed(Purchasing).

Due to being unable to find work in that field, I switched career fields.  The last time I worked in Purchasing was 18 years ago.  Now, I’m trying to see if it’s possible for me to return to said field.

What are the odds of me being seriously considered for a position in said field, due to the career field change?
