First time negotiating for a salary. I need advice!
So I've been working for this company for two years as a shift manager earning about 30,000 a year after tax.

I've just applied for a site management role within the company and the pay bracket is $50,000-$85,000. I have been involved in hiring and training as well as working at multiple sites for the company. I am thinking of trying to negotiate a base salary of $58k. Does this seem reasonable or am I aiming too high??

I am trying to prepare myself, as I have no experience in doing this as I've been on a wage for all my working life.
