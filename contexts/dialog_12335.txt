PAULINE: I had a nasty foreboding feeling at first, but now I realise my crime was too frightful for an ordinary lecture.
HONORA: From now on, you're sleeping in the house, where we can keep an eye on you.
HONORA: If you think for one minute that your father and I will tolerate this sort of behaviour, you've got another thing coming! You're only 14!!! You're a child! What on earth's the matter with you, Yvonne? You know what can happen with boys . . . Don't you have any self-respect?
HONORA: sighs.
PAULINE: Can I go now?
HONORA: grabs Pauline by the shoulders.
