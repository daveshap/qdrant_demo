DONNIE: Will you please talk to me?
GRETCHEN: Not now, Donnie. It isn't a good time.
DONNIE: Then when? I have to talk to you.
DONNIE: Ms. Pomeroy... what's going on?
MS. POMEROY: Donnie... it's Friday. Shouldn't you be off with your friends, scaring old people?
DONNIE: Where are you going?
MS. POMEROY: I don't know. That's a good question... but suffice to say that I am no longer your English teacher. They fired me.
DONNIE: That's bullshit. You're a good teacher.
MS. POMEROY: Thank you, Donnie. And you're a good student. Lazy... but a good student. Unlike most of the others, you question Mom and Dad's rules.
DONNIE: What do I tell the rest of the class when they ask about you?
MS. POMEROY: Tell them that everything is going to be just fine. It is up to the children to save themselves these days. Because the parents... they don't have a clue.
DONNIE: What's Cellar Door"?"
MS. POMEROY: A famous linguist once said... that of all the phrases in the English language, of all the endless combinations of words in all of history... that Cellar Door" is the most beautiful."
DONNIE: Cellar door.
MS. POMEROY: Sometimes it's the only thing that keeps us going.
MS. POMEROY: So... will Donnie find his Cellar Door?
DONNIE: I think I already have. But now she won't even talk to me.
MS. POMEROY: Then go find her, Donnie. Don't let her get away. She was right about the rabbits. Go.
