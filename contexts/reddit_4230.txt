(22F) first ever date, need advice
I matched with a guy on Tinder and for the first time we actually talked for more than 2 consecutive days and he asked me to get tacos. At the time I had to postpone for a test but he said we could work out the details later but it would probably be on a Friday/weekend. It’s now Wednesday and we haven’t set any details. Should I ask about it? I feel like recently I’m the one starting all the conversations... If we set a date/time, what does one wear to a taco date? I’m very short and kind of overweight and despite the fact that I put a full body pic on my profile I’m afraid he will be surprised when he meets me in person. Help!
