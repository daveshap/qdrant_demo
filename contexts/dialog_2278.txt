STEED: Not all Tradition is bad, Mrs. Peel. No thank you.
EMMA: But why? What's the point?
STEED: A Gentleman has to have a code. This is part of mine. A uniform. Think of it as my suit of shining armor.
EMMA: And I suppose you're the knight.
STEED: The most unpredictable piece on the board. And always ready to protect his queen.
EMMA: That's predictable. When I find a queen in need of protection I'll let you know.
