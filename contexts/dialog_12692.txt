JENNIFER: You didn't answer my question.
MCCLEOD: I know.
JENNIFER: You have an interesting accent. Where are you from?
MCCLEOD: Why?
JENNIFER: I'm just trying to place you.
MCCLEOD: I've lived all over the world.
JENNIFER: You're not an easy person to get to know.
MCCLEOD: Why? Because I don't give up all my secrets?
JENNIFER: How come you wanted to meet tonight?
MCCLEOD: I wanted to get to know you better.
MCCLEOD: That makes you uncomfortable?
JENNIFER: A little -- yes. My interest in coming here is profession.
MCCLEOD: Is it?
JENNIFER: Yes -- it is.
MCCLEOD: Alright. In the shop you mentioned something about--
JENNIFER: --the Calan. Do you know who they are?
MCCLEOD: Why don't you tell me.
