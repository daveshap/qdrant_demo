GOODSPEED: Just come and get me, sir. I'm tired.
SANCHEZ: Name your vacation spot, Goodspeed. The Bureau'll pay for it.
GOODSPEED: Mason, uhm, John, I have something to tell you. You know that pardon= contract you signed?
MASON: Womack ripped it up, right?
GOODSPEED: You knew? All this time?
MASON: I'm not a fool, Billy.
GOODSPEED: All I know is that whatever you did, you don't deserve to go back.
