DARCY: I thought you had a girlfriend.
TELLY: Naw. I'm not seeing anybody. What about you?
DARCY: No. I can't. My mom won't let me have boyfriends.
TELLY: She won't? Why not?
DARCY: I don't know. I guess it's cause my sister Nicki had a baby when she was like 15. She was really young so my mom is like very protective over me.
TELLY: Yeah. I can understand that.
