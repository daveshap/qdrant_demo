NARCISSUS: Where is my family?
COMMODUS: Cooperate and they will be returned to your estate. I could have executed you.
NARCISSUS: And my army would have thrown your body into the Danube.
COMMODUS: The army is a problem. They love you. You have led them from victory to victory in the name of Rome and they love you. And after all, you're just a hothead acting from a misguided sense of loyalty -- who could fault you for that? Thus have I reached a compromise with the Senate over your fate: instead of executing you, I'm sending you to Rome where you will be tried...
NARCISSUS: On what charge?
FALCO: Insubordination. To the Emperor... and the Senate.
COMMODUS: Quintus will tell the army that you are being called to Rome to celebrate your victory. They will hear that you are living in luxury. He will let them feel you have betrayed them for the good life. And soon the army won't even remember your name.
NARCISSUS: The Senate too?
GAIUS: The moment you returned from the battle your options were clear. If you are a friend to neither side, legate, you must be an enemy to both. We needed to know what you believed.
NARCISSUS: I hope you live to see what I believe...
