EIRIE KID: Hey, Luther told me he was carrying a wad, but I didn't figure this much.
HOOKER: Which way did he do, Eirie?
EIRIE KID: Straight north. He was gonna take it all and run.
HOOKER: The bastard. He can blow his nose all the way.
COLEMAN: You're late. Where you been?
HOOKER: I had some appointments.
COLEMAN: How much did ya lose?
HOOKER: All of it.
COLEMAN: In one goddamn night? What are ya sprayin' money around like that for? You coulda been nailed.
HOOKER: I checked the place out. There weren't no dicks in there.
COLEMAN: You're a con man, and you blew it like a pimp. I didn't teach ya to be no pimp.
HOOKER: What's eatin' you? I've blown money before.
COLEMAN: No class grifter woulda' done it, that's all.
HOOKER: You think my play is bad?
COLEMAN: I think it's the best...
COLEMAN: ...It's the only reason I ain't quit before now.
HOOKER: What?
COLEMAN: I'm gettin' too slow for this racket. I done the best I'm gonna do. You hang on too long, you start embarrassin' yourself.
HOOKER: What are you talkin' about? We just took off the biggest score we've ever had. We can do anything we want now.
COLEMAN: It's nothin' compared to what you could be makin' on the Big Con. You're wastin' your time workin' street marks.
HOOKER: Hey look. You think I'm gonna run out on ya or somethin'? Just cause we hit it big. Luther, I owe you everything. If you hadn't taught me con, I wouldn't know nothin'.
COLEMAN: Aw hell, you sound like some goddamn sucker. You know everything I know. You got nothin' more to learn from me.
HOOKER: But you played the Big Con. You said it was nothin'. A game for flakes and mama's boys.
COLEMAN: And I'm tellin' ya now, you're a fool if you don't get into it. A bigger fool than I was. I been lookin' for this one all my life, Johnny. Now I got a chance to step out at the top.
HOOKER: What the hell you gonna do with yourself?
COLEMAN: Aw, I got a brother down in K.C., runs a freight outlet. I can go halfsies with 'em! It ain't too exciting, but it's mostly legal.
COLEMAN: Straighten up, kid. I wouldn't turn ya out if ya weren't ready. I got a guy named Henry Gondorff I want you to look up. There ain't a better insideman alive. He'll teach ya everything ya gotta know.
HOOKER: You'll take a cut of what I make, won't ya?
COLEMAN: I'm out, Johnny.
HOOKER: If that's the way you want it.
COLEMAN: That's the way I want it.
HOOKER: How do you like that Coleman, huh? After three years.
EIRIE KID: Aw come on, it was the only thing to do. He knew he was holdin' ya back.
HOOKER: We were partners. If it weren't for Luther I'd still be hustlin' pinball down at Gianelli's. I don't need anything more than I got.
HOOKER: You ain't gonna have nothin' if you don't lay off them games of chance. There's a depression on ya know.
HOOKER: There's always a depression on.
EIRIE KID: If you saved a little, you wouldn't have to grift so much.
HOOKER: I like griftin'.
EIRIE KID: You could buy yourself some things. Clothes, or a nice car...
HOOKER: I don't look any good in clothes and I don't know how to drive. What else ya got to sell, Eirie?
EIRIE KID: Forget it.
HOOKER: Hi there, Snyder. Things a little slow down at the Bunco Department tonight, eh? Somebody lose the dominoes?
SNYDER: You scored blood money today, Hooker. You need a friend.
HOOKER: Aw, find yourself a shoplifter to roll.
