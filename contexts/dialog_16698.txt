QUINCY: So how long is this trip?
KYRA: Four days.
QUINCY: Nah.
KYRA: Why not?
QUINCY: You might be the only one with a job.
KYRA: Baby, don't talk like that. Your rehab's going well. You'll be back before you know it.
QUINCY: Sometimes I wonder if it's worth it. Busting my ass, for what?
KYRA: To do what you love.
QUINCY: I don't know sometimes.
KYRA: You're just scared. I know rehab is hard, and you have to worry about whether you'll be as good as you were but you will be. I believe in you. You just have to get back on the court. Like you'd get back on a horse.
QUINCY: A horse?
KYRA: Don't make fun of me when I'm being wonderful and supportive. You belong on the court. Just like I belong in the stands, looking cute and cheering you on.
NATHAN: Hey, munchkin.
MONICA: Dad. What are you doing here?
NATHAN: I was upstairs for a meeting. I've been hearing good things about you.
MONICA: That tends to happen when you're the boss's daughter.
NATHAN: So how's the job going?
