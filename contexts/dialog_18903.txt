VADA: This is really very nice of you.
MAN: It's no problem, I had a mother once myself.
MAN: If it's in here at all, it's in the back two rows.
VADA: O.K. Thank you very much.
MAN: Happy hunting.
NICK: I don't mean to alarm you, but I'm getting a nose bleed from the altitude.
VADA: Just remember the needle in the haystack.
NICK: I never did understand that story, did someone find the needle or not?
VADA: What difference does it make?
NICK: A big difference, if someone found it we should keep looking, if they didn't we're just wasting our time.
VADA: Oh my gosh, here it is!
VADA: Look, here she is. Margaret Ann Muldovan - Newspaper, Literary magazine, French Club, Drama Club, Debate Club, Girls Basketball and Swim team. With Maggie's combo of good looks and talent, we're sure to be seeing her name in lights. She was gonna be famous.
NICK: Yearbooks always set you out for disappointment, I want mine to say: Nick probably won't amount to much, so don't be surprised if you never hear anything about him again. Can we go?...It smells like someone left their gym bag in here.
VADA: It's the leather bindings, I love the fragrance of vintage books.
NICK: I love the fragrance of chilidogs.
