HELEN: I should have gone to the police, I suppose.
GIB: But you didn't. Why not?
HELEN: I don't know. I guess... I wanted to see what would happen.
HARRY: What did happen?
HELEN: Three days later, he called me. He told me to meet him at Overlook Park.
SIMON: Thank you. You saved my life. What's your name?
HELEN: Helen.
SIMON: You can call me Simon. You're very brave to do this... You opened it.
HELEN: I just glances inside.
