MR. JONES: I got your message. Where's Craig?
UNCLE ELROY: I don't know, I didn't leave you no damn message!
MR. JONES: You didn't call the Sandwich Joint with a urgent message?
UNCLE ELROY: Hell naw, Willie. Them fleas and tics must be sucking on yo' brain!
MR. JONES: Somebody left me a message. Well where's Craig and Day-Day?
UNCLE ELROY: I don't know. Suga, go ask Miss Ho Kym if she seen them.
KARLA: Next time, page me first.
CRAIG: Okay.
KARLA: You alright?
CRAIG: Yeah, I'm cool. See you later.
DAY-DAY: Look, man, this is a big misunderstanding. All we wanted to do is borrow some sugar.
ROACH: And some rolling papers.
DAY-DAY: ...and some rolling papers, that's it. We didn't mean to mess up y'all get together or nothing. How y'all doing?
