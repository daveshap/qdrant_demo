CLEAR: I don't understand... did you see Tod die? Did it happen again, like on the plane?
ALEX: No, but it might as well be the same thing. This was a message... from someone, or something... hinting... at the design.
CLEAR: Alex, on the plane... you must have experienced... some kind of hyper awareness. But here... you're suggesting Tod's death... and maybe our own... will happen because of... an active Presence.
