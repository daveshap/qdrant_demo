WADE: You got yourself a computer, Alma.
ALMA: Been putting my files into it. You take sugar and milk?
WADE: No. Black.
ALMA: Are you alright, Wade?
WADE: Yeah, sure. Why? I got this damned tooth, I got a few things bugging me, like everybody else. But I'm okay.
ALMA: Well, you look... sad. Upset. I don't mean to pry. I'm sorry about your mother. It was a nice funeral.
WADE: Alma, I think there's some dirty business going on in this town.
ALMA: Always has been.
WADE: This is maybe worse than you and I are used to. What I'm talking about, I'm talking about murder. Among other things.
ALMA: Who?
WADE: Evan Twombley, the union boss who got shot. Somebody murdered him.
ALMA: Who?
WADE: You know Jack Hewitt, the kid I work with?
WADE: ...if Jack told the truth, he could be free by the time he's my age.
ALMA: Sometimes things are simpler than you think. Let me ask you a question.
WADE: You don't believe me?
ALMA: About Jack? No. Have you checked out the tax bill on your father's farm lately?
WADE: I know he's due for the last two years. I was thinking of paying it when the insurance comes in.
ALMA: Has anybody offered to buy it?
WADE: As a mater of fact, yes. LaRiviere.
