QGIS equivalent of ArcMap's Selection by Location Have their Centroid In option I am currently using QGIS 2.18.15 and I have two sets of polygon layer data. I would like to use the Select by Location research tool in order to isolate the polygons that have their centers within the other separate layer. ArcMap has a specific \"have their centroid in\" option when selecting by location. I don't see that QGIS has this. Is there an equivalent?
