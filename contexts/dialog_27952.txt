DARRYL: Damnit, Thelma, don't holler like that! Haven't I told you I can't stand it when you holler in the morning.
THELMA: I'm sorry, Doll, I just didn't want you to be late.
THELMA: Hon.
DARRYL: What.
THELMA: Have a good day at work today.
DARRYL: Uh-huh.
THELMA: Hon?
DARRYL: What?!
THELMA: You want anything special for dinner?
DARRYL: No, Thelma, I don't give a shit what we have for dinner. I may not even make it home for dinner. You know how Fridays are.
THELMA: Funny how so many people wanna buy carpet on a Friday night. You'd almost think they's want to forget about it for the weekend.
DARRYL: Well then, it's a good thing you're not regional manager and I am.
THELMA: 'Bye, honey. I won't wait up.
DARRYL: See ya.
