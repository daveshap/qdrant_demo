ALABAMA: You did it, Quickdraw. I'm so proud of you. You were like a ninja. Did I do my part OK?
CLARENCE: Babalouey, you were perfect, I could hardly keep from busting up.
ALABAMA: I felt so stupid just blowing those bubbles.
CLARENCE: You were chillin', kind of creepy even. You totally fucked with his head. I'm gonna go grab dinner.
ALABAMA: I'm gonna hop in the tub and get all wet, and slippery, and soapy. Then I'm gonna lie in the waterbed, not even both to dry off, and watch X-rated movies till you get your ass back to my lovin' arms.
