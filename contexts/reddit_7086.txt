Resources for "corporatizing" my Startup Office
Hey /r/Jobs. 

So I recently started at a small business / startup running the office operations and my boss has been talking more and more about wanting to implement processes/procedures to ease our transition from a small startup-style, two-to-three person passion project to a more organized, efficient operation that can scale upward and not miss a beat. 

I've always worked for small businesses that have prized their ability to adapt and change on the fly, and I don't want to lose that adaptability. However, we need a solid foundation in place and a structure to grow into and expand beyond and I'm a little intimidated being the boots-on-the-ground point person to execute my CEO's vision. 

Any books or resources anyone could point me toward to better analyze my company's workflow and get things running like a well-oiled machine? 

Also, if this isn't allowed here, please let me know and I will delete and post to the appropriate sub. 


Edit: I initially wrote this question like a moron. Hopefully I come off less like a moron.
