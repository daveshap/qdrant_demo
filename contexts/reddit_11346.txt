Perfectionism is a bitch
I’m tired of trying to be perfect. It takes over everything I do and I feel like I’m not living. I’m recent months, it’s put me into a depressive state. I’ve been trying my hardest to get out of it, and I’ve been having good days recently. But on bad days it feels so heavy. The perfectionism is a gut reaction and NOTHING is good enough. Things are ok but I feel like I can’t measure up to whatever idealized bullshit I concocted. It’s been over a decade and I realize now that all I really want isn’t to be perfect but to be ok with being imperfect. Being okay with that is so much easier said than done though. I’m trying. The fact that I posted this is me trying.
