What is required for the draft agreement between the EU and UK to take effect, and what obstacles stand in the way?
Yesterday evening, the UK and EU [published a draft agreement concerning the UK leaving the EU.](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/756374/14_November_Draft_Agreement_on_the_Withdrawal_of_the_United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Northern_Ireland_from_the_European_Union.pdf) [Warning, 500+ page PDF]

Subsequently, several ministers from Prime Minister Theresa May's government [have resigned](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/nov/15/dominic-raab-quits-as-brexit-secretary-over-eu-withdrawal-deal) and several backbench Tories [have called for a no confidence vote in PM May.](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/nov/15/jacob-rees-mogg-to-send-letter-of-no-confidence-in-may)  The specific mechanism mentioned there is through a Conservative party leadership contest.  Would that work in concert with, or in lieu of [a no-confidence motion in the Commons?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motions_of_no_confidence_in_the_United_Kingdom)

The BBC [put out this flow chart](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46192884) explaining the process.  Is it complete, or correct?
