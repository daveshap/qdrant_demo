Is it common for hr to give job seekers false hope?
I’ve been looking for employment for a while now. Unfortunately I haven’t had much luck. I spoke with an hr representative at a company recently and had a phone interview. She told me she would contact me soon. I waited and decided to contact her after not hearing back a week later. Her reply seemed positive and she told me she would call me that day, but didn’t. Is this common?should I move on?

Thanks
