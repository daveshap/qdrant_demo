Rescinded job offer. What to I tell potential employers?
I just lost a job offer four days from my start date. My last job elected to let me go when I gave them my two weeks notice so I've been just doing chores these last two weeks.

It was my own fault that the offer was rescinded, I screwed up in a not-even-funny kind of way. But now I don't know how forward to be about my last month of employment with any potential employers.

It went kind of like this working-> applying for jobs while I worked-> get an offer quickly -> start new job after I finish two last weeks-> two days in, get another offer from an undeniably better job who took their time responding-> submit two weeks notice-> they let me go early so they're not paying too train me for labor they won't use-> 4 days before start date at new job, the offer is rescinded.

This is the first time I've been unemployed since high school and I'm not really prepared for it financially or mentally. I don't know how to explain this on my resume other than a gap in employment that gets worse the more an employer might ask about it. Please advise.
