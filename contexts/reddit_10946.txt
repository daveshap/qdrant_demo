What are you realistically supposed to do? I fail to see how suicide is the most harmful option.
**Option 1:** tell a person you trust, maybe your friend.

**Problem 1:** you place a huge burden on them now to “keep you alive” and they may behave in ways that hurt you instead. They may tell people that you don’t want to know. You don’t want to stay alive no matter what, you want to feel better. And being betrayed doesn’t make anything better.

**Problem 2:** telling someone means you’re not actually serious about killing yourself. “The only truly suicidal people are already dead.”

**Problem 3:** telling someone is manipulative and harmful to *them*. Abusive. If a friend leaving will tip you over the edge, you can’t *tell* them that. It’s not their fault you feel suicidal without them. 

**Problem 4:** you can’t “get help” all by yourself, but you can’t tell anyone else either. And professional help is a long, sometimes expensive process. Like hell I want to go therapist shopping while lying through my teeth to not be locked up against my will. Let alone without the support of a trusted friend. I just want to be better!

**Problem 5:** the reason you’re suicidal in the first place is because life just hurts - the past, the present, the future. It’s not just because of one breakup, or an unpleasant family life, or a toxic relationship, or possible mental health issues, or an existential crisis about your faith. It’s a combination of absolutely everything and no single person can fix that for you, even if you desperately want one to.

**Problem 6:** nothing changes. Except that now you’ve hurt and burdened more people, you’ve damaged relationships, and you feel the same if not worse than before.

**Solution 1:** you don’t tell anyone, in part to not burden or hurt anyone, in part to be taken seriously. I *am* suicidal, and if I need to prove it then so be it. 

**Solution 2:** you commit suicide. People get hurt, but the hurt is less than the cumulative hurt and exhaustion from trying to help when no help can be had. After all, in the end the problem was your existence; not all problems have solutions. Minimize damage by acting now, rather than waiting around for more people to get entangled with you.
