VIVIAN: Nice car. Yours?
EDWARD: No.
VIVIAN: Stolen?
EDWARD: Not exactly.
VIVIAN: Mind if I turn on some heat?
EDWARD: If you can figure it out, be my guest.
EDWARD: Very good. You're obviously mechanical.
VIVIAN: You're not from L.A., huh?
EDWARD: New York.
VIVIAN: What motel you staying at?
EDWARD: <u>Ho</u>tel.
VIVIAN: Okay, what <u>ho</u>tel?
EDWARD: Regent Beverly Wilshire. I bet you know it.
VIVIAN: Yeah, I peed in the fountain there once. Give me a break.
EDWARD: What's your name?
VIVIAN: What do you want it to be? Vivian, my name's Vivian.
EDWARD: You like being a hooker, Vivian?
VIVIAN: It pays.
EDWARD: So do day jobs.
VIVIAN: Day jobs, yeah. I've tried them. Turn right.
EDWARD: Must be dangerous. Hooking.
VIVIAN: Tell me about it. L.A. is suffering from a wacko epidemic. And who knows where half the guys I pick up have been. I mean, I use condoms. Always. And I get checked out once a month at the free clinic. Not only am I better in the sack than an amateur, I'm probably safer.
EDWARD: Very good. You ought to have that printed up on your business card.
VIVIAN: If you're making fun of me, I don't like it.
EDWARD: Sorry. If I did, I didn't mean to.
EDWARD: Ugly habit, biting your nails.
VIVIAN: You don't know habits, you think this is ugly.
