BOBBY: Jesus Christ, guys. What the hell's Khruschev thinking?
THE PRESIDENT: Did you have any indication of this from Georgi? Any possible warning or sense of motivation?
BOBBY: Complete snowjob. And then we went out and told the country they weren't putting missiles into Cuba. By the way, you realize we just lost the midterms.
KENNY: Who gives a shit about the midterms now? The Soviets are putting nuclear weapons ninety miles away from us.
BOBBY: You mean there's something more important than votes? Didn't think I'd live to see the day, Ken.
