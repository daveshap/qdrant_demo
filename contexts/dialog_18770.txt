BRUCE: I'll do the standard research and have them in by midnight, pending any unforseen problems.
ZACH: Good. Nice to see you, Bruce. Johnny.
JOHNNY: What's wrong ?
BRUCE: I just want to double check the facts.
BRUCE: I see here that this guy has made deposits into his own account for the last four months. Each one in the amount of $100,000. He then puts in deposits into his girlfriends account.
JOHNNY: So ?
BRUCE: He already had a balance of $600,000.
JOHNNY: He probably has a history of this shit.
BRUCE: Yeah, maybe.... Let's start the background checks. Let's see where they live and what kind of security systems....
JOHNNY: Matthew lives on the Upper West Side, kinda posh for a temp don't you think ?
BRUCE: Any priors ? Any police record ?
JOHNNY: Checking..... Hah ! He has a shit load of unpaid parking tickets...

JOHNNY: Yeah, but we're talking 43.

MATTHEW: Hello.
SAUNDRA: Hi. I brought some wine.
MATTHEW: Thank you, won't you come in ?

SAUNDRA: What an incredible view !
MATTHEW: Thank you.
SAUNDRA: Are you okay ?
MATTHEW: Yes, Excuse me for a second.
SAUNDRA: You have a real nice place... how can you afford this working as a temp ?
MATTHEW: Well, I make good investments, I lead a double life as a secret agent.. I....I ... I have very rich parents. I have always had a lot of money.
SAUNDRA: If they're so rich, why are you working at all ?
MATTHEW: I just want to have something that's mine, you know ? It's like living off of their money is fun and all. There are certain materialistic needs that I have that can only be satisfied with that extra little scratch.
SAUNDRA: Like what, a Porsche ? A Ferrari ?
MATTHEW: Would that impress you ? I mean you're the kinda woman that probably has Ferrari written all over your personal ad.
SAUNDRA: Actually, I'm more interested in the man behind the wheel more than the manufacturer. So what is it that you have that makes you a materialistic fool ?
MATTHEW: My own sit down Star Wars arcade game. Wanna play it ?
MATTHEW: Okay, now go under go under it ! Shoot Vader's Tie Fighter ! Get Him Get Him !
SAUNDRA: Yahoo !!!!!
BRUCE: Are you Matthew Parker ?
MATTHEW: Yes, can I help you ? Maybe a donut or something ?
BRUCE: That's very funny, sir. You are under arrest.
