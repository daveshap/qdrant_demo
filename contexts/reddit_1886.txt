Shoutout to everyone who thought they were special
To all the kids who thought “maybe they’ll see my shining personality through my essays even though I don’t have perfect stats” and the kids who were told they were different and special so many times that they actually started to believe it for a second. 

Im with y’all today. I started this process with the thought that I would be okay, honestly I didn’t even think a 15% acceptance rate was super low. I shotgunned top schools thinking “of course I’ll get in somewhere, I have such a unique story”. Boy was I wrong. 

18 more decisions to go for me, however many more y’all have I’m rooting for you🥳❣️
