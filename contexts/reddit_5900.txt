Is getting a masters in Health Informatics from a program without CAHIIM accreditation worth it career wise?
I’m coming from a background that’s unrelated to this field and currently trying to find a program that I’ll be able to get in. Since I’m from the Midwest, I’ve been primarily looking around here, but I’m open to recommendations. So far I’ve been looking into UIC (downside that it’s all online, but it is accredited), DePaul (in person, but not accredited), SIUE (downside smaller city, in the process of getting accredited, but not sure what that really means to me), and then SLU (in person, not accredited).

So far, I’ve been attracted to the DePaul program as I believe I’ll be able to do better since it’s in person.  I’m not sure how it’ll impact me when I look for position after I complete the degree.

Basically my question: Is it worth even going to a school that isn’t accredited? Would it be difficult/near impossible for me to find a position? 

Thanks!
