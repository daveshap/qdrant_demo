i think im trying to ruin my life so its easier to suicide
even when everything is going fine, i'm actively trying to make things worse. i don't do my course work, i try to ruin relationships, i eat garbage or not at all, and barely sleep.

i'm terrified i'm getting stupider, i'm losing brain cells. i used to be smarter i know it.

i need to kill myself, i can't imagine feeling good or having an easy time getting out of bed

i live in a garbage heap. i havent done laundry in weeks. i lie to my psychiatrist/psychologist every time.

i need to kill myself, but i'm too happy. my depression is fake, i'm just lazy. i have too many friends, there are things i look forward to. but nothing important. i dont care about my future and i need to die.
