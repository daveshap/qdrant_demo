MAMA GIBSON: Rayford, I wanted so much more for you than this.
RAY: Don't cry, mama. This place ain't so bad as it looks. Sure, we work hard, but there's plenty fresh air and sunshine... And you know something else, I've taken to going to church regular. They got services every Sunday right there in the mess hall.
MAMA GIBSON: Don't you lie to me, Rayford. You still have your daddy's watch? Well, this is all I can give you. I wish it was more.
RAY: I can't take that, mama.
MAMA GIBSON: Don't argue with me. You need it more than I do. I know how a little money can help in a place like this.
RAY: I can't believe this. I always said I'd never end up like this. I thought I'd make something of myself, do something with my life. You know, be successful. Have a big house, a family. Now I'm gonna end up just like daddy.
MAMA GIBSON: Don't say that, Rayford. Don't ever say that. He gave up hope. That's where you gotta be different.
RAY: They gave me life, mama.
MAMA GIBSON: I gave you life. And they can't take it away from you. Remember that. You'll get outta here someday. I believe that. You gotta believe it, too.
