FINNEGAN: ...Jagger was here...I was here...
PANTUCCI: You don't give a shit about anything do you?
FINNEGAN: Sure I do...I give a shit that at 0300 hour we reach our point of dentination. I give a shit that those mojos got to do what they got to do, and 45 minutes later we are turn around and gone. I give a shit that by the time the sun comes up we are all safely tucked in bed.
PANTUCCI: That's it? That's all you give a shit about?
FINNEGAN: Oh yeah...and that my stich job doesn't make you uglier than you already are...this won't hurt a bit...
