JAMES: Where were you?
CATHERINE: In the private aircraft hangar. Anybody could have walked in.
JAMES: Did you come?
CATHERINE: No. What about your camera girl? Did she come?
JAMES: We were interrupted. I had to go back to the set...
CATHERINE: Poor darling. What can I do about Karen? How can I arrange to have her seduce me? She desperately needs a conquest.
JAMES: I've been thinking about that, about you and Karen.
CATHERINE: There, that's better.
JAMES: Thank you.
CATHERINE: Not a lot of action here.
JAMES: They consider this to be the airport hospital. This ward is reserved for air- crash victims. The beds are kept waiting.
CATHERINE: If I groundloop during my flying lesson on Saturday you might wake up and find me next to you.
JAMES: I'll listen for you buzzing over.
JAMES: Is that a gift from Wendel? It has an aeronautical feel to it.
CATHERINE: Yes. From Wendel. To celebrate, the license approval for our air-charter firm. I forgot to tell you.
JAMES: That's going well, then.
CATHERINE: Well, yes. You're getting out of bed tomorrow. They want you to walk.
CATHERINE: The other man, the dead man, his wife is a doctor - Dr. Helen Remington. She's here, somewhere. As a patient, of course. Maybe you'll find her in the hallways tomorrow on your walk.
JAMES: And her husband? What was he?
CATHERINE: He was a chemical engineer with a food company.
