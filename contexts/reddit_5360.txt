My manager is trying to write me up for not showing up for work even though I was not scheduled for that day.
I was originally scheduled to only work Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday this week but my coworker told me yesterday that my manager is trying to write me up for not coming to work on Friday. I was never scheduled Friday however my manager took the liberty herself to schedule me for Friday without my permission or even calling me to come in. I have evidence I wasn't suppose to work Friday (paper posted schedules and recites of hours I work) so I just wanted to ask what should I do and is my manager even allowed to do this.
