My boss announced that they don't believe in taking sick days, this really goes against my beliefs.
I just got hired with this company a month ago after almost a year of interviewing with them. Feeling pretty confident about my job and my work ethic, and I know my value to the company will only begin to shine as I get into the groove of things.

This evening we had a small meeting with our team, and my boss jokingly said that "we don't believe in sick days here". That honestly was upsetting to hear. I though I was hired onto an innovative and forward thinking company, however I am starting to sense the corporate ego and pride of working 12 hour days and not taking sick leave seep out.

As much as I am a go-getter and have ambitions I want to achieve - in due time, this kind of mentality is not in line with my philosophy of how I want to live my life. Nothing is going to stop me from taking a sick day when its warranted, and I will certainly put in the hours when they are needed, but I also fundamentally believe in a work-life balance for a healthy sustainable life.

What are your opinions on this grind mentality?

EDIT: Couple people bringing it up as though it was a joke, which it was said in a jokingly manner - however, the context of the conversation was revolving around "hard work, long hours, and self sacrifice to make it in the industry". So I believe it was a joke with an undertone of expectation that unless you are killing yourself working then you're not going to be as valued as the folks who do. And honestly, I'm not gonna give up my gym, morning cycling, or cooking dinner time just to prove to other people that "I am worth it".
