BRAD: Man, I don't even want to see those guys from Carl's again.
LISA: If you'd apologize I think Dennis would take you back.
BRAD: Apologize to that wimp? No way. Fuck Dennis Taylor.
BRAD: I'm just glad we're still together, Lisa, because I need you this year.
LISA: Look, Brad, I've been trying to think of a way to tell you this. We're almost out of high school, this is our last year. I think we owe it to ourselves to be free, and meet some new people. Then, if we get back together, we'll know it's the right thing.
