After making it on-site to an interview, doing multiple presentations, I was rejected. Now a month later, the position has been reposted. Is it a bad idea to reapply?
I asked for feedback from the recruiter on the initial rejection and whether it was my experience or interview performance that contributed most to the rejection. He said that the team simply went with another candidate.

It’s a very selective company, and I got pretty far, but I don’t wanna jeopardize my chances. Especially since I have another first round interview with them for a different role next week.
