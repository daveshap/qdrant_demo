Am I the only one who gets more depressed in the summer?
I've always suffered from depression regardless of the seasons, and I know most people's depression seems to worsen during the winter months, but for some reason, for me it's the opposite. I get SO depressed in the summer, I don't know what it is...maybe seeing everyone out enjoying themselves just makes my own inner misery that much darker. Today's the first day of summer and I'm just dreading making it through :( I realize how weird this probably sounds
