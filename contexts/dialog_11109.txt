DR. PAYNE: You're a lucky man, Mr. Whale. Whatever damage was done by your stroke, it left your motor abilities relatively unimpaired.
WHALE: Yes, yes, Dr. Payne. But from the neck up? What's my story there?
DR. PAYNE: That's what I'm trying to explain.
DR. PAYNE: The central nervous system selects items from a constant storm of sensations. Whatever was killed in your stroke appears to have short-circuited this mechanism. Parts of your brain now seem to be firing at random.
WHALE: You're saying there's an electrical storm in my head?
DR. PAYNE: That's as good a way as any to describe it. I've seen far worse cases. You might even learn to enjoy these walks down memory lane.
WHALE: But the rest of it? The killing headaches. The phantom smells. My inability to close my eyes without thinking a hundred things at once. It's all nothing more than bad electricity?
