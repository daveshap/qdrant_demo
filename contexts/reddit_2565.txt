Does it makes sense to get a job just to pay the bills while still educating for something that you truly want to do as a job in the future?
I got a job offer from a government institution in Justice. It's not what i want but it could keep me going and i would perhaps be able to move out from my parents. 

But i would really like to work in IT, but might not have the skillset for it yet. Shall i get more experience first or try right away in the industry? 

I am 25, have a degree in economics and some online data science courses knowledge, but also a year of work epxerience in communications and 1 year of volunteering. 

thank you so much in advance (:
