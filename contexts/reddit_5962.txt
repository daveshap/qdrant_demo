What Types of Jobs Require an MD and MBA?
I'm currently doing my MD degree right now and I was thinking about doing an online MBA afterwards. I know that there are combined programs, but it was too late and I already finished a year. What sort of Jobs would be available for me if I do end up getting both degrees?
