Why can\u2019t \u201cone who dislikes the questioner\u201d be right? In Half-Blood Prince, as Harry is going towards his first \u2018class\u2019 with Dumbledore, he passes Trelawney in one of the corridors. Hiding behind a statue, he overhears her Divining with a pack of tarot cards (or whatever they are exactly) while she thinks she\u2019s quite alone and unheard. She says:<blockquote>  \u2018Two of spades: conflict,\u2019 she murmured, as she passed the place where Harry crouched, hidden. \u2018Seven of spades: an ill omen. Ten of spades: violence. Knave of spades: a dark young man, possibly troubled, one who dislikes the questioner \u2013\u2019<br>   &nbsp; She stopped dead, right on the other side of Harry\u2019s statue.<br>   &nbsp; \u2018Well, that can\u2019t be right,\u2019 she said, annoyed, and Harry heard her reshuffling vigorously as she set off again, leaving nothing but a whiff of cooking sherry behind her.    Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, ch. \u2018The House of Gaunt\u2019</blockquote>As far as I can tell, we never see another reference to this. She sees conflict, an ill omen, violence, and a dark young man who dislikes the questioner, whatever exactly that may mean.But apparently, that can\u2019t be right. Something is wrong about this combination, even though it seems to fit Trelawney\u2019s usual style of death, gloom, and horror at every step.Why is that? What is it that can\u2019t be right about this prediction?And for bonus points: what is the reference to the dark young man who dislikes the questioner all about? The only thing I can think of is Harry being questioned by Umbridge, but that was a year earlier\u2026
