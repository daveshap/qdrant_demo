Tips for being Trapped for the Pandemic
I want to start by saying: relatively speaking, I'm unbelievably fortunate to have a job given everything that's happening. A healthy majority of my friends have lost their jobs, and I know that I'm lucky to have not. This all said...

Before the pandemic, I'd started looking for a new job. My current job had been stagnant, with no room for growth, and it not being in my industry. Then the pandemic happened. For the first month I couldn't do work, because there were so many unknowns. But, over the past month, I've been doing basically two months worth of work, in much less time. The ability to turn down additional assignments or ask to only have meetings to be between 9 and 5 has gone away, with most higher-ups believing I have nothing better to do.  Yesterday I was in a meeting unrelated to my job, but wasn't allowed to leave as I 'surely had nothing but free time on my hands.' Last week, I spent an hour on a video call watching my boss plan a different meeting, and I was kept on the call in case he had questions.

The combination of an overbearing amount of work, the complete disregard for my time and personal life, and the inability to affect any change in my role has really started to take a toll on my mental health. Normally, these would be red flags for a person to leave, but with the job market dried up for quite some time... and I'm feeling incredibly trapped in my job,

Again, I know I'm fortunate (when discussing with friends/family, I've been described as being "on the negative side of very lucky"), even compared to some co-workers. But spending 60 hours a week working a job that is ruining my mental health, while in a situation that's already mentally taxing...

I'm looking to see if anybody has any tips, thoughts, or suggestions on how to improve (or at least, make bearable) my situation.
