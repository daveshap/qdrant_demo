QUINCY: Why she gotta be a ho, just cause she wants to get with me.
MONICA: She's a ho cause she's sending her coochie through the mail.
QUINCY: And?
MONICA: And? She's not saying, I think you're a nice guy and I wanna get to know you better
QUINCY: So she's honest.
MONICA: Yeah, an honest tramp-ass ho. But I guess you'll stick your dick in anything.
QUINCY: Didn't know you cared so much.
MONICA: I don't.
QUINCY: So who you going to the dance with, Spalding?
MONICA: Who's Spalding?
QUINCY: See, that's why you ain't getting recruited.
MONICA: Who said I'm not getting recruited?
QUINCY: Your hot-ass temper.
MONICA: I'm not the one who put this scar here.
QUINCY: God, here we go.
MONICA: When we were eleven years old cause he was about to lose.
QUINCY: That's it, give it your best shot.
MONICA: Would you watch the damn road?
QUINCY: I mean it, give it your best shot, cause I'm tired of you holding that over my head.
MONICA: I'm warning you, don't tempt me.
QUINCY: I'm warning you. You don't stall that bad attitude, no one's gonna recruit you.
MONICA: Please, you jump in some guy's face, talk smack and you get a pat on your ass. But because I'm a female, I get told to calm down and act like a lady". I'm a ballplayer
QUINCY: With a jacked-up attitude.
MONICA: Didn't know you cared so much.
QUINCY: I don't.
MONICA: Good.
