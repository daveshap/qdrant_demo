Positioning myself for Assistant Complex Director position next year
In my first year I was on my hall council, was in a first year leadership program, and I worked for the office of New Student and Family Programs as a new student registration staff member. This year, i'm going to be an RA. I hope to apply and get an Assistant Complex Director job next year. My question is what more can I do to set myself up for that? Being an RA limits possibilities, but I feel it's an essential part of an Assistant Complex Director's resume. I want to be proactive and make myself the best candidate. Any advice?
