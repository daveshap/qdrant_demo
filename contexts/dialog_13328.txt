LILA: Are you seeing somebody else, Nathan? I just have to know.
NATHAN: Of course not.
LILA: It would just be helpful to know.
NATHAN: No.
LILA: Because, you know, you seem so distant. And you work late every night. And we hardly ever have sex, and when we do, it's... I don't know. It feels different.
NATHAN: I'm just preoccupied.
LILA: Do you like my new look?
NATHAN: Yeah. It's nice. It's really good.
LILA: I'm trying, you know. I'm trying to be what you want. I want to be what you want, Nathan. All I want is to be what you want.
NATHAN: Shh. It's okay. It's okay, Lila. You're what I want. You know that. You're exactly what I want.
LILA: Really?
NATHAN: Sure. Of course.
LILA: Because I'm really trying, you know. Rosie says maybe only another two years of the elctrolysis.
NATHAN: That's great.
LILA: I've signed up for a ballet class. And look at my nails! A real girl!
NATHAN: That's great. It's a great color for you.
LILA: Oh, Nathan, let's have a baby!
NATHAN: So anyway, that's the nightmare I've been having lately.
WENDALL: Do you suppose it has anything to do with Lila's unusually hairy body?
NATHAN: No, why?
WENDALL: Well, it seems that since Lila broached the subject of children, you've been on edge and I know you have an issue with the, uh, body hair.
NATHAN: Oh, I see. Yes, that's something to think about. That's very good. That's what you get the big bucks, right? Ha ha.
WENDALL: I just think it might be important to explore your feelings for Lila.
NATHAN: I love Lila. I mean, she's a wonderful person. And... she loves me! That's no small potatoes. I mean she really loves me. She's sacrificed so much to be in this relationship with me. And she's a good person. A truly good person. How rare is that in this world, eh? And how could I stop loving somebody because of a little physical imperfection, if it can even be called that. I mean, God knows I'm not perfect! What about my eyesight? It's lousy, that's what! Lila's not going to leave me because of my eyesight. What about my penis?
WENDALL: And how do you feel about Gabrielle?
PUFF: Good-eve-n-ing-lay-dees-and-gent- elmen.
NATHAN: Bravo, Puff! Bravo!
NATHAN: Isn't Puff doing spectacularly, honey?
GABRIELLE: Hmmmph.
NATHAN: Gabby, what is it?
GABRIELLE: Hmmph. Hmmph. Nathan, we have to talk, you and I.
NATHAN: Fine.
GABRIELLE: Not in front of the boy.
NATHAN: Very well.
NATHAN: My little French.
GABRIELLE: Stop. Get away.
NATHAN: What is it?
GABRIELLE: You have to choose Nathan. It's like Sophie's choice. Only it is Nathan's choice. Did you ever see that movie, Sophie's Choice? It is like that. Only it is this.
NATHAN: Gabby, you know I'm trying to sort things out.
GABRIELLE: No! It is now that you must decide. I love you, Doctor Nathan... ...but I will not wait. I will not be your chippy. I will not be your little Mademoiselle Parlez-vous side dish. My love. I want to have a sweet tiny baby inside my belly... from you.
NATHAN: I love you so much, Gabrielle.
GABRIELLE: But?... But? There is a but
NATHAN: But I don't know how to leave Lila.
