Crossed the grim '250+ applications with no Job' mark today. Seeking exterior perspective.
Hello all, I write this post for an exterior perspective. I have clouded my mind over the course of 1 year of applying for jobs. I can't seem to gather inspiration to apply anymore. 

I graduated in 2019 (Batchelors in ME), and I joined a Startup, but due to the depressive environment in the company ( very bad management ) I quit within a month of tourment. 

I believe I am a good engineer, I know my fundamentals and I am good with Analysis. I thought it would be relatively easy to get a job. And now, an year in, having given 6 interviews with 250+ applications, I find myself to be unemplyed. Of the 6 interviews, 1 rejected me and the others just did'nt work out due to multiple reasons including Covid19. 

In my most recent application which literally took 1 month, they lead me on with a project (which took me 1.5 weeks to complete), and loved the report I submitted. They thought it was "great work" and that I seem to be a good fit for their company. About a month ago, they suddenly stopped contacting me without any reason and don't respond to my emails or calls. It really hurt me because I had done 3 interviews with them and really looked forward to working there. 

Reluctantly, I find myself back to square one, sending out emails and applying through various sites. 

I still persue engineering with small projects, simulations and refresh my memory with the basics. It is a part of me, but it hurts not being able to apply my knowledge. I live with my parents, which makes things even worse, I want to be financially indipendent. 

There are companies I can work in (who would hire anyone instantly), with minial work on CAD and a low pay. I am hoping I don't have to resort to that. 

Ah, thanks for reading through. I could really use some inspiration or just an exterior perspective. Any advice would be appriciated :)
