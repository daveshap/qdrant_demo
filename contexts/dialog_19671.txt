LEON: Just an old man. His memory is getting weak.
NINOTCHKA: What are you after?
LEON: Must one always be after something?
NINOTCHKA: Your tactics are useless. My name is neither Buljanoff, Iranoff, nor Kopalski.
LEON: Oh, Ninotchka, who wants to talk business. If you win the suit, fine. If we win the suit, better. You do me an injustice. When we went to my apartment did I have the slightest idea that you had any connection with this deal?
NINOTCHKA: But you have now, and I know now that you are a man who employs business methods which in Russia would be punished by death.
LEON: Death! Death! Always so glum! What about life, Ninotchka! Do Russians never think of life? Of the moment in which we are living? The only moment we really have? Don't take it all so seriously, Ninotchka. Nothing is worth it. Please... relax... I beg you, Sergeant... smile!
NINOTCHKA: What?
LEON: Will you smile?
NINOTCHKA: Why?
LEON: Just smile.
NINOTCHKA: At what?
LEON: At anything. At the whole ludicrous spectacle of life. At people being pompous and taking themselves seriously and exaggerating their own importance. If you can't find anything else to laugh at you can laugh at you and me.
NINOTCHKA: Why?
LEON: Because we are an odd couple.
NINOTCHKA: Then you should go back to your table.
LEON: No, I can't leave you. I won't. Not yet. Not until I've made you laugh... at least once.
NINOTCHKA: Ha! Ha! Now go back.
LEON: That's not a laugh! I mean a laugh from the heart. Now let's see. I'm going to tell you a funny story. Just a moment... I've got it! Well, it seems there were a couple of Frenchmen who went to America...
NINOTCHKA: On which boat?
LEON: Well, er... let's drop it. I don't think you would care for that one.
NINOTCHKA: Probably not.
LEON: Do you like Scotch stories?
NINOTCHKA: I have never heard one.
LEON: Two Scotchmen met on the street... and I don't know the name of the street and it really doesn't matter. Well, anyway, one's name was McIntosh and the other's was McGillicuddy. McIntosh says to McGillicuddy, Hello
NINOTCHKA: I wish they had never met.
LEON: So do I. Now, here's a great one... Ha! Ha! Ha! Well, maybe it's not so good. Let's forget it! How's this? Two men are looking at the moon. One says to the other, Is it true that a lot of people live on the moon?" "Yes
LEON: I suppose you don't think that's funny?
NINOTCHKA: No.
LEON: It seemed funny to me when I first heard it. Maybe the trouble isn't with the joke. Maybe it's with you!
NINOTCHKA: I don't think so.
LEON: Maybe you haven't any sense of humor. Well, I'll give you one more chance! Now listen!
