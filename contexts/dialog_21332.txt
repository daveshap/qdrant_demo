HARP: Special Agent Utah, this is not some job flippin' burgers at the drive-in. Yes, the surfboard bothers me. Yes, your approach to this case bothers me. And yes, you bother me. You two have produced squat in the last two weeks, during which time the Ex- Presidents have robbed two more banks!! Do you have anything even remotely interesting to tell me?
UTAH: Caught my first tube this morning.
PAPPAS: What, you couldn't have just left the thing in your car?
UTAH: It sticks out, so I can't lock it. Look, Angelo, you think I joined the FBI to learn to surf? This was your lame-o idea in the first place. You gotta back me up on this.
PAPPAS: Johnny, all I can say is we better come up with something real soon.
