WORF: Sir, we've had an unauthorized access into the main computer.
PICARD: Who was it?
GEORDI: It's going to take some time to find out -- the data stream was rerouted through substations all over the ship.
PICARD: What programs were accessed?
GEORDI: That's what I don't get -- it's mostly basic stellar cartography: star charts; communications protocols; some uplinks from colony tracking stations. It's not even restricted material.
PICARD: Set up a security program to detect any unusual data stream rerouting. If it happens again, we want to be ready.
GEORDI: There's something else. I was reviewing the sensor logs.
