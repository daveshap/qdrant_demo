Tips for Finances in Grad School?
Hey guys, does anyone have any tips for keeping yourself afloat in grad school? My program "strongly discourages" working but I maintain an almost full-time restaurant job anyway. Things have been fine for now, but this fall I'm expected to complete a required internship on top of my normal amount of classes. This internship will pretty much take away any time I currently have left over for my job, but it isn't paid. I'm at a smaller school that doesn't give stipends to masters-level students, and my loans only cover tuition/textbooks. Any advice?
