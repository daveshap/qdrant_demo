WESSEX: Two hours at prayer!
NURSE: Lady Viola is pious, my lord.
WESSEX: Piety is for Sunday! And two hours at prayer is not piety, it is self- importance!
NURSE: It would be better that you return tomorrow, my lord.
WESSEX: It would be better that you tell her to get off her knees and show some civility to her six-day lord and master.
WESSEX: My lady VIOLA.
VIOLA: Lord Wessex. You have been waiting.
WESSEX: I am aware of it, but it is beauty's privilege.
VIOLA: You flatter, my lord.
WESSEX: No. I have spoken to the Queen. Her majesty's consent is requisite when a Wessex takes a wife, and once gained, her consent is her command.
VIOLA: Do you intend to marry, my lord?
WESSEX: Your father should keep you better informed. He has bought me for you. He returns from his estates to see us married two weeks from Saturday. You are allowed to show your pleasure.
VIOLA: I do not love you, my lord.
WESSEX: How your mind hops about! Your father was a shopkeeper, your children will bear arms, and I will recover my fortune. That is the only matter under discussion today. You will like Virginia.
VIOLA: Virginia?!
WESSEX: Why, yes! My fortune lies in my plantations. The tobacco weed. I need four thousand pounds to fit out a ship and put my investments to work--I fancy tobacco has a future. We will not stay there long, three or four years . . .
VIOLA: But why me?
WESSEX: It was your eyes. No, your lips.
WESSEX: Will you defy your father and your Queen?
VIOLA: The Queen has consented?
WESSEX: She wants to inspect you. At Greenwich, come Sunday. Be submissive, modest, grateful and brief.
VIOLA: I will do my duty, my lord.
