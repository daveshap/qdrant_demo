CHRIS: Time for lunch I think. I'll get the sandwiches. What would you like Holly?
HOLLY: I'm not hungry, really.
DOUG: Get me a couple of beers and a salami.
CHRIS: We could make a start on the floor afterwards.
DOUG: No, We aren't going to do it.
CHRIS: What?
HOLLY: Seems a shame!
DOUG: The way I look at it, I've carried the camel to water and stuffed it's head under - if it doesn't drink now, we might as well shoot the thing and call it a day.
