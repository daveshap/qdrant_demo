DRIVER: How was your day, today, sir?
MARTIN: Effective. But to tell you the truth, I've lost my passion for work.
DRIVER: Do you like the people you work with?
MARTIN: I work alone.
DRIVER: That's it then. That's it. I've always been alone. That's why I'm a good driver. I can handle it. See, I can think on my feet. I survive, I'm a thinker. And I can sit there in front of your house for two hours and it don't bother me. Some people can't do it! Some people are ranting and raving, Tell them fuckin' people to get out here and get in this car
MARTIN: You understand the psychology of the job.
DRIVER: I do. Some guys can't adjust to it; they can't handle it.
DRIVER: You look like you're far away. Far away and thinking about other things. I'm right about that, aren't I?
MARTIN: No.
DRIVER: Well, let's just say that sometimes I'm right. Sometimes you are.
MARTIN: Sometimes I am. Sometimes. It's only natural.
DRIVER: It's only natural....
DRIVER: I been looking at you, and I've decided that I want to share something with you.
MARTIN: Okay.
DRIVER: Because your problem is you're bored. And you have a very big mind. I am part of what I call a brain syndicate.
DRIVER: I am part of a network of minds, a group of five people who are all connected, over hundreds, even thousands of miles, through the mind. We can think with each other, think for each other. I can be driving somewhere, sleeping with a woman-- whatever it is-- and at the same time be thinking a thought in someone else's mind, far away. Running someone else's brain.
MARTIN: Up on the right.
DRIVER: And when you think of it, it's not so surprising that a small group of people control the whole world, is it?
