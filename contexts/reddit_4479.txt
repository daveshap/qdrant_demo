I cleaned my room and showered to feel better.
Recently, my room was a mess. My room always become messy when I neglect cleaning it and it gets really stinky and my bed looks weird. Also, I can go a lot of days without showering, just because I had a bad day, or I just donâ€™t feel like it.

Today, I decided to clean my room, and take a shower from the past few days and Iâ€™ve never felt any better. I hope that I can keep this up everyday instead of periodically. 

Just a reminder, I KNOW you can do it. You have the motivation. Youâ€™re a strong individual and trust me, being clean can make you feel good. ðŸ’ž
