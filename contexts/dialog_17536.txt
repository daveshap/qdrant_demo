LEONARD: You know him?
NATALIE: No. But the photo on his license looked familiar. I think he's been in the bar before
LEONARD: Have I told you what this man did?				*
NATALIE: Yes.
LEONARD: Then you shouldn't have to ask.
NATALIE: But even if you get your revenge, you won't remember it. You won't even know it's happened.
LEONARD: * So I'll take a picture, get a tattoo.			 * 							 * The world doesn't disappear when you			 * close your eyes, does it? My actions			 * still have meaning, even if I can't			 * remember them. My wife deserves				 * vengeance, and it doesn't make any				* difference whether I know about it.			 *
NATALIE: Tell me about her again.
LEONARD: Why?
NATALIE: Because you like to remember her. I want to see you enjoy yourself.
LEONARD: She was beautiful. Perfect to me -				*
