RUBY: I've known the past of all the people I've fucked without a condom. Like I know one of the people got tested and was negative.
LINDA: Yeah.
RUBY: And I know that one of them fucked like two other girls, who were both virgins, so I knew he was safe.
LINDA: Yeah.
RUBY: And the other person I just fucked, which was a mistake. But I went to the clinic last week with Jennie.
RUBY: I made her get tested with me because I didn't want to go alone.
LINDA: Did they ask you a lot of questions?
BLACK NURSE: How old you?
RUBY: 17.
WHITE NURSE: How old are you?
JENNIE: 15.
BLACK NURSE: How many people have you had vaginal intercourse with?
RUBY: Umm. Altogether?
BLACK NURSE: Yes. Altogether.
RUBY: Hmm. I'd say eight, maybe nine.
BLACK NURSE: How many times have you gone unprotected?
RUBY: With four of them, I didn't use any kind of protection. Wait, maybe it was three.
WHITE NURSE: How many people have you had vaginal intercourse with?
JENNIE: One.
WHITE NURSE: Were you protected?
