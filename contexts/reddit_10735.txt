My parents are emotionally abusive and I'm thinking about killing myself
Hello. I'm depressed. I want to say I'm an introvert but I really am not. I love being with people, laughing with people, sharing stories with others, but I'm unable to relate to anyone. I feel alone. I have my family but that's the problem. My parents are the problem. Ever since I was young they were overly protective of me and never allowed me to go out with friends or have sleepovers with our neighbors. This left me with the disability to socialize well. I am now unable to relate with others, I don't know how to talk. I don't know how to form a bond with others. The worst part is my parents don't give me any attention. Every time I talk to them I feel like they're not treating me like I'm a child and I don't deserve to talk to them. Everytime I open up about being lonely they just tell me to "grow up" and stop being emotional. I'm already 18. I feel so confused. I feel sad, I cry often. The only things that put a smile on my face are my dogs, video games, and Netflix. Other than that I have nothing, no one. I want to be a strong person and be capable of living without attention from others but I doubt I'm capable of that. I'm very emotional. From the past few months suicide was always on my mind. That's probably because I feel really lonely, and also because I want my parents to emotionally suffer too, because that's what they did to me.
