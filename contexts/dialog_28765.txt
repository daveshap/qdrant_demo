RAY: This Clear Moon's house?
CROW HORSE: Yeah. It's time to beat the drum. You better wait here. He don't trust the white man.
CROW HORSE: Alright. Shit's comin' down. He's callin' council fire. All the old chiefs and the warriors, too. I gotta be at Grandpa's place in two hours. We need to get the tribe together. We need to block this thing.
RAY: What we need... is Richard Yellow Bird.
CROW HORSE: I thought it was a rare case of a brother getting a break in the courts. We did an honorin' song for him and everything.
RAY: He's looking at a few hundred years in Leavenworth. He's not gonna come out without a fight.
