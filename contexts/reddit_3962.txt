Does anybody feel like there’s way too many rules when it comes to dating?!
Sup everyone (28 M) here! I just wanted to get everybody’s opinion on this But does anybody out there feel like there is too many unwritten rules when it comes to dating?!? For example, don’t show interest in someone you like, don’t text back immediately...wait a few days,  Play hard to get, be direct but not too direct, your friends hold a lot of power on your new love interest, no sex until date number 3, stick to gender stereotypes, not accepting a last minute offer and so on and so forth ... like what the hell!?! I know there’s probably more rules out there that I haven’t even touched upon or even know about yet since I feel like there’s a new rule created everyday but this is freaking ridiculous! Who created all these rules and WHY?! literally SUCKS the fun out of dating ...
