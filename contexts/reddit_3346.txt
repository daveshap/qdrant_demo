Having someone who wants to spend time with you is so underrated
This might sound totally obvious, but it's so nice when you meet someone who actually messages/calls you first. And wants to spend time together. I don't like to always be the one trying to initiate seeing one another. A simple "want to hang out?" from a girl and then like actually spending a good amount of time together without feeling like either one of you wants/has to leave.

I don't know. In my experience as a guy I've often been the one to ask someone if they want to hang out it feels like. Not always but pretty often I think. And it's nice when someone else expresses interest in you.

I think that I had specific memories as a kid/teenager when there were times when I got blown off or ended up by myself somewhere or something? Idk? All I know is that when someone expresses interest in talking to me and seeing me it brings out the best in me and makes me feel so good.
