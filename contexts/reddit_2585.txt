Coworker is acting like my manager, am I taking things to personally?
Potentially in need of some constructive criticism, but I’ve been feeling managed by one of my coworkers as of late. I’m wondering if she’s really trying to be helpful or if she’s campaigning for a supervisor position. We are on the same team & have the same job title. Also worth noting, I have been doing this job for 3 years, she has been with the company for a couple years but is new to this role. She is also at least 30 years older than me.

Today she sent an email to myself, my manager, and a couple of other coworkers that I work closely with. It included a list of “best practices” when onboarding our clients and said she was excited to teach me how to do so. Again, this is a job I’ve been doing for 3 years and have never received a complaint about my quality of work. The kicker about this email is that she also felt the need to copy and paste our job description into it.  I spoke with a coworker that was also on the email to see if I had missed something and to find out why this email was even sent, and that coworker confirmed that I have not had any missteps in these areas so the email seems very out of the blue. 

There have also been a couple of instances where she checks in to make sure I’ve done things on my accounts that she is not involved in. Every time she asks these questions the answer is yes, I have done it, but she continues to go out of her way to make sure I’m doing my job.  It’s out of character for members of our team to check that other teammates are completing work properly, (whether that’s right or wrong for our organization I’m unsure) I can’t imagine ever doing this to another member of my team. It feels like she’s stepping on my toes but I don’t want to seem ungrateful if she truly is trying to help. 

Any advice on how to handle / constructive criticism if I’m taking things to personally are welcome!!
