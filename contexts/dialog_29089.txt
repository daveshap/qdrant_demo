JOHNSON: Wyatt, are you crazy?
WYATT: I made a promise.
VERMILLION: Wyatt, listen, you can't beat Him. You're good and God knows You got the courage, but you Ain't in Ringo's class. Hell, He's the best that's ever been. 'Cept maybe for Wild Bill.
JOHNSON: He's right, Wyatt. Ringo could Put five into you before you Could even get one into him.
WYATT: But I'd do it, I'd get that one Into him. So help me God, I would.
JOHNSON: All right Wyatt, maybe you can. But you gotta die to do it. Understand? You gotta die!
WYATT: What makes a man like Ringo, Doc? What makes him do the things he does?
DOC: A man like Ringo's got a great Empty hole right through the Middle of him and no matter what He does he can't ever fill it. He Can't kill enough or steal enough Or inflict enough pain to ever Fill it. And it drives him mad. Sick mad. Cold and dirty.
WYATT: So what does he want?
DOC: What does he want? He wants revenge.
WYATT: Revenge? For what?
