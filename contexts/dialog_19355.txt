CRAIG: I do.
MR. JONES: What it smell like?
CRAIG: Smells like you didn't fall in no mud.
MR. JONES: I gotta get'em fixed. They don't roll down.
CRAIG: All damn.
MR. JONES: Just hold your breath.
MR. JONES: Nice neighborhood, huh?
CRAIG: It's alright.
MR. JONES: 18-years of chasing dogs; and my lazy ass brother hits the lotto his first time playing. I still can't figure that one out.
CRAIG: Why they got to have the loudest house on the block!
