MELVIN: Well, I'll do one thing for you that might cheer you up.
SIMON: Get out.
MELVIN: Don't piss on a gift, tough guy. You want to know why the dog prefers me... it's not affection. It's a trick.
MELVIN: I carry bacon in my pocket.
SIMON: Oh, my gosh.
MELVIN: Now we'll both call him.
SIMON: Come on, sweetheart...
MELVIN: Yo, yo, yo...
SIMON: Would you leave now, please?
MELVIN: Stupid dog. I don't get it.
