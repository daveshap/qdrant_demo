Is anyone interested in a career coach hosting an AMA?
I consult professionals full time and would be happy to do an AMA, but want to gage interest beforehand. Hoping that 20+ people are interested.

Topics that come to mind:

* "should I quit my job?"
* "how to change careers with my narrow set of skills/experience?"
* "I don't feel passionate about my work"
* "I'm struggling to get interviews"
* "How can I get a promotion?"
* "How can I make decent money without a college education?"
* "Is college even necessary?"
* "I feel lost in my career"
* "My boss is a jerk"
* "How to overcome workplace inequality?"

# Update:

Thank you for the upvotes! I'll start putting together the logistics for an AMA and follow up with details. I posted this on these other subreddits as well. Are there others I should reach out to as well once I'm ready to announce the AMA time & date?

# Update #2:

**The AMA has been scheduled for next Tuesday, October 23rd, 6pm Eastern time (GMT-5) on** [/r/CareerGuidance](https://www.reddit.com/r/CareerGuidance).  I'm looking forward to the conversation!

P.S. I apologize for all of the fanfare. I truly didn't anticipate this large of a response, but am excited to help many individuals with free, no-catch career advice!
