Not enough training? Going in blind (sorta)
Not enough training? Going in blind (sorta)

Today I start my official first day as a “cashier” at this small retail store. It’s a fairly brand new one for that matter and I legitimately didn’t get as much training running the front end of the store as I hoped. My first few days consisted of us new employees opening boxes and placing merchandise in the correct slots, watched a couple basic (yet common sense) videos of how to approach customers and what not. A couple videos about the new policies regarding safety due to the on going Covid pandemic. On the final day/ pre opening of the store, we got a super brief rundown of what they expect us to do up in front. They told us how the new self checkout system works, how to return items, how to fix mistakes, remove items.. etc.. They also told us that we must keep track of how many people are in the store at a giving time and all this other important information. All of this new info was literally dumped on us new guys without anything else to go by, no scenarios, no hands on training, nothing! Just 30 minutes, or less of the manager explaining to us what’s going to happen.. this has been the most barebones training I’ve ever received! Do they really expect us not to mess up somewhere ? Have y’all ever went into your job blind with little to no training? If so, how do you survive the first couple of days?
