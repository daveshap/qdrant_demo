How do I acquire SEVIS, F1 / J1 visa international student qualifications in student affairs?
I'm currently a student affairs admin at a big public, one fairly new to the field.  I love working with international students, though they make up only a minor portion of my assigned caseload.  Looking ahead, I'd be very interested in obtaining additional qualifications that would aid me in becoming more involved with that particular student demographic.  My question is: how do I acquire the necessary qualifications?  For those of you who work with an international student population - how did you acquire the necessary knowledge base of SEVIS, immigration law, or anything else that made you qualified for your respective position?  On the job training?  Some other form of professional development?  Formal courses?  Independent study?
