WES: How long we going to keep this up.
JAEGER: Until we're out of the mine field is how long.
WES: Haven't found a mine for half a mile, or more.
JAEGER: That don't mean nothing. Iraqis could have just spread them out like that; make us think we're in the clear.
WES: You want to crawl, crawl.
JAEGER: You're going to blow yourselves up.
EPPS: Wes is right. If there were any more mines we would have found them. Hell, that one you stepped on was probably old anyway; left over from the war with Iran.
JAEGER: You don't know that. It could be a trick.
EPPS: If we step on a mine we'll know it was. Let me see the maps.
