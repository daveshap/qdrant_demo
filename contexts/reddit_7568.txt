Where to obtain PDF copies of BMJ articles/sections unavailable on BMJ.com (or unavailable on PMC pre-2008)?
Hi,  I was wondering about where I might be able to source sections of the  BMJ as PDFs, that are presently only available in online non-PDF form on  [BMJ.com](https://bmj.com/).

For instance, the article,

Midmer, D. Cinemeducation: a comprehensive guide to using film in medical education. BMJ 2005; 330 doi: [https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.330.7503.s232-a](https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.330.7503.s232-a)

(available at [https://www.bmj.com/content/330/7503/s232.2](https://www.bmj.com/content/330/7503/s232.2)) is provided in webpage form with no PDF links.

Being  a pre-2008 article, most articles would be on Pubmed Central. But I  have found that this and some others like it, specifically those that  don't have page-number suffixes (in this case: 's232-a'), are not  available on PMC either (in this case, [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/issues/18603/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/issues/18603/)). Have I misunderstood its location within PMC? Or is truly not there?

And what are the options to obtain PDFs of post-2008 articles that are not available as PDFs on BMJ.com?

Hence,  my query is, whether and how it might be possible to obtain PDFs of  such articles (without scanning the physical journal itself).?

Thank you.
