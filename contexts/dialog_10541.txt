RONNIE: Who the fuck are you?
BONES: Ray Barboni. From Miami.
RONNIE: What, like that's supposed to mean something to me?
RONNIE: The man you're steppin' on belongs to me and my partner.
BONES: He owes me money.
RONNIE: Get in line, bro.
BONES: I don't like waiting.
RONNIE: Tough shit, bro. This ain't Miami. You want something, talk to me.
BONES: Hey, fuckball, I don't need your permission. L.A.'s an open city.
