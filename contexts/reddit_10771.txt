why are we only appreciated when we’re finally gone?
for fucks sake, it bothers me how many people say such kind words at funerals of people who killed themselves. why couldn’t you say that when they were alive?? most of the time they felt so unloved they wanted to take their own life, because no one stopped to say that they appreciate them. that’s at least how i feel.

i don’t know if i believe in some kind of afterlife, whether it be heaven or living out a life as a ghost. but part of me wants to kill myself, just to be able to watch my own funeral. call me an attention whore, i get it. but god damn. how do people really feel about me? and how many people are faking it? i want to know if my father tells the truth when he says he couldn’t live without me. i want to know if my mother can finally say that she loves me at my own funeral. i wonder what kind of words my only two friends will say, and i want to see if they actually cared. if they actually were my friends. 

there’s so much i want to know, and all of it is basically craving to know that someone gives a shit. and if killing myself is the only way of giving myself a chance to see that, why shouldn’t i?
