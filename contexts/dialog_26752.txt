TRENT: You were off your ass back there! Where the hell did you learn to do all that twirly whirly shit?
MIKE: I took a ballroom class with Michelle. I never danced with anyone but her, til tonight. That Lorraine chick is good.
TRENT: You were good. Did you see how she was vibing you?
SUE: Sorry man.
TRENT: Yeah. You probably coulda hit that tonight if you didn't have to drive us home.
SUE: ...Definitely...
MIKE: It's not like that...
TRENT: Don't give me that! She liked you, man.
MIKE: I know she liked me. I mean, it's not like I wanted to do anything with her tonight.
SUE: Good for you, man. He's being smart.
MIKE: She's really special, guys.
TRENT: The bear's got his claws back.
SUE: Be smart about it.
TRENT: I'm telling you. Wait three days...
SUE: You don't have to wait three days...
TRENT: ...Okay, two...
SUE: ...just be smart about it.
MIKE: Guys... Guys... I got it under control.
TRENT: Oh. He's got it under control...
SUE: ...Well, then, I guess we don't have to worry about him anymore.
TRENT: Our little baby's growing up...
