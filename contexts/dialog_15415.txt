KATHY: And what if he's wrong. If you were one hundred percent sure it was Peter you would've arrested him. If it is someone else then he's going to kill again tonight and you're sitting here ignoring the message.
FRANK: We're going to work on the message.
KATHY: This stinks! You want to know what I think? I think there have been five murders and you've got shit to go on. You need to blame someone and he's the easiest choice.
FRANK: The most logical choice.
KATHY: You don't have a shred of evidence!
ANDY: We'll find the evidence.
KATHY: You couldn't find your dick in a wind storm!
