What are the reasons for making automobile tariffs disproportionate?
Trump wants to impose a [25&#37; tariff](https://www.ft.com/content/50e7bada-6a47-11e8-8cf3-0c230fa67aec) on vehicles imported into the US from Europe. [Some say](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenroberts/2018/05/24/six-reasons-trumps-proposed-auto-tariffs-are-a-bad-idea/#3214062c580e) that is unfair while [others say](https://global.handelsblatt.com/politics/trump-may-point-eu-tariffs-ifo-says-899083) Trump has a point. Either way, fact remains that there are already European [tariffs of 10&#37;](http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2015/january/tradoc_152998.1%20Trade%20in%20goods%20and%20customs%20tariffs.pdf) on American cars whereas it's only 2,5&#37; the other way around.

What are the reasons for Europe having automobile tariffs on American cars, and what are the arguments for and against Europe eliminating these tariffs if the US does the same?
