After 5 years of anxiety depression and daily panic attacks I’ve decided enough is enough!
I’m currently on my way to a new start, a new job fuck this anxiety it will be here regardless so I might aswell go and live my life as I want to! No longer will I let it control every aspect of my life, and for the first time in about 7 years I have just got a solid 8 hour unbroken sleep, just thought I would share this with you guys, take care everyone.
