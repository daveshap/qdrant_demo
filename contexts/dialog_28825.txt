REILLY: How's the print coming?
BEV: One partial from the handle matches the suspect from last night. Name's Carl Taylor. Long record of arson, assault, the works. The other print - we got nothing from our data base or the FBI or CIA... still waiting for Interpol.
REILLY: Damn.
BEV: Coffee, Mike?
REILLY: No thanks, Bev.
