I am officially employed! :D :D
I just signed to the YMCA as a Youth Development Leader!  (Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/cf3a32/i\_got\_offered\_a\_job/](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/cf3a32/i_got_offered_a_job/))

I am so happy!  I actually drove over to the new school today...and it's less than a five-minute drive from my apartment.  Wow.  I start on August 10th and students arrive on the 12th.  This is going to be awesome.  I'm finally in a teaching role (kind of, it's a start, anyway!) and that's amazing.

Edit: ???  (This was only up three minutes before it was sitting at 67%.  Somebody was jealous.)
