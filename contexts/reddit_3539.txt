Is it weird to feel turned off when girl talks about partying?
I'm not sure why, but whenever I talk with a girl and she talked about partying, I start losing interest. I don't party often, but still gone clubbing and made out with random girls and stuff. But for some reason whenever a girl talks about how last year she went on spring break and partied nonstop or how she loves to drink,  it's just an instant turn off for me? Even though I'm not against these things? Like it's fine if a girl mentioned partying (everyone gonna party especially if you love in a big city ) but when they go in detail talking about drunk they were and stuff, then it turns me off. Anyone else like this?
