LAWYER: -- Plead guilty and throw yourself on the mercy of the court. It's the best deal you're going to get.
VIKTOR: I could get the death penalty.
LAWYER: You certainly will if you go to trial -- a jury in this kind of ugly mood. You've killed an icon, for God's sake.
VIKTOR: I didn't kill anyone, Bernard, there was no one to kill!
LAWYER: An insanity defence.
ELAINE: Let's go, Lainey. There's nothing here.
LAINEY: Just a minute.
ELAINE: God, it's so like your father. Why can't people take responsibility for their actions anymore? I can almost forgive him for killing Simone -- but denying her existence. I can never forgive that.
LAINEY: Because obviously she existed, right?
ELAINE: I know it as surely as you're sitting here, sweetheart. She was the most vital woman I ever met.
LAINEY: So you did meet her?
ELAINE: Of course. What are you suggesting?
LAINEY: I mean really meet her -- in the flesh.
LAINEY: I know it's embarrassing to admit it, mom, but when I think about it -- honestly, I haven't. I mean, it feels like I have. I know more about her than members of my own family. She's even in my dreams. But I realized, going back through my diary, they were all TV appearances, near misses at parties, second-hand rumor, gossip on the internet. I've never actually seen Simone up close, touched her, been in her physical presence. Have you?
ELAINE: Well, I --
LAINEY: -- We don't believe daddy because we don't want to believe we were taken in too.
ELAINE: Lainey, there's no evidence that Simone isn't real.
LAINEY: Listen to what you're saying, mom. Is there any evidence she is?
