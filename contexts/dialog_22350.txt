ROMEO: I will follow you.
MERCUTIO: Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,
NURSE: If ye should lead her into a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of behavior, as they say: for the lady is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were an ill thing, and very weak dealing.
ROMEO: Bid her to come to confession this afternoon; And there she shall at Father Laurence' cell Be shrived and married.
JULIET: O honey nurse, what news? Nurse?
NURSE: I am a-weary, give me leave awhile: Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I!
JULIET: I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news: I pray thee, speak.
NURSE: What haste? can you not stay awhile? Do you not see that I am out of breath?
JULIET: How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath To say to me that thou art out of breath? Is the news good, or bad? answer to that;
NURSE: Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,
JULIET: But all this did I know before. What says he of our marriage? what of that?
NURSE: Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I! O, my back! Other' other side,--O, my back.
JULIET: I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well. Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?
NURSE: Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?
JULIET: Where is my mother! How oddly thou repliest! Your love says, like an honest gentleman, Where is your mother?'
NURSE: O lady dear! Are you so hot? Henceforward do your messages yourself.
JULIET: Here's such a coil! Come, what says Romeo?
NURSE: Have you got leave to go to confession to-day?
JULIET: I have.
NURSE: Then hie you hence to Father Laurence' cell; There stays a husband to make you a wife
