LAURIE: Hello?
ANNIE: Why did you hang up on me?
LAURIE: Annie, was that you?
ANNIE: Of course.
LAURIE: Why didn't you say anything? You scared me to death.
ANNIE: I had my mouth full. Couldn't you hear me?
LAURIE: I thought it was an obscene phone call.
ANNIE: Now you hear obscene chewing. You're losing it, Laurie.
LAURIE: I've already lost it.
ANNIE: I doubt that. Listen, my mother is letting me use her car. I'll pick you up. 6:30.
LAURIE: Sure, see you later.
ANNIE: Bye.
