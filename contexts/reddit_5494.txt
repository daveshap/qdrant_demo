How normal is it to say "I'm afraid you may not want this job as you are over-qualified" ?
I had an interview in a close-by factory today. Thing is, I never had a real job due to mainly school (I didn't even had time for part-time jobs due to the sheer number of courses + travelling) and I could only do odd jobs which don't pay well. Most who applied here finished elementary and that's it (don't get me wrong I'm not degrading them). I learned at uni for 3 years after HS and the lady said to me that she is afraid I'm over-qualified. I kind of think she just kindly told me I'm not a good fit but then again we had a small test and I did best on all of them. Quick thinking, how can I endure monotonous work, colour-matching and how precise my hand was.

I wasn't rejected I'll get a phone call in a few hours if I was OK or not.

Now, I don't really want to spend my life in this factory but I need a starting point and in half a year this is the only place I got called in. Is it possible I'm really "overqualified" or could it be the lack of valid experience? I really don't know, maybe some of you can give me some insight.

EDIT: It seems you guys all imply in one way or another that they are concerned about me leaving due to the differences in qualifications and it's consequences. That idea completely flew over my head so thanks a lot for pointing it out! 

EDIT 2.0: I got the call, I only need the medical exam and all is set.
