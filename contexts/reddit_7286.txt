Point of Sale (POS) technician
I don't know if this is the correct subreddit to do this on so please let me know if it isn't.

I'm thinking of becoming a POS technician because there seems to be some demand for it in my area. Does one have to become certified to do it? I'm already A+ certified and I'm finishing a contract as a computer repair technician. For those of you that don't know, the CompTIA A+ certifies people to do computer support. I remember reading somewhere that you need a Network+ cert to get into it, is that true. I know Microsoft has this cert called the MB6-897, will that prepare me for it? 

For those of you who are currently POS techs what did you do get into it? Did you get any certs? Do you like it?
