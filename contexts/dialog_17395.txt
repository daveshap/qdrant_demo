COLONEL: Gimme mine. I ain't staying! You know we were headed for the Columbia River country before all this John Doe business came up. You remember that, don't yuh?
JOHN: Sure. I remember . . . Say, did your ears pop coming up in the elevator? Mine did.
COLONEL: Aw, Long John . . . I tell youâ€”it's no good. You're gonna get used to a lotta stuff that's gonna wreck you. Why, that fifty bucks in your pocket's beginning to show up on you already. And don't pull that on me neither!
JOHN: Stop worrying, Colonel. I'm gonna get my arm fixed out of this.
