Upgrade from 17.04 to 17.10 on Samsung NC 10 80% of screen corrupted I have using various versions of Ubuntu over the 5 years on my Samsung NC10 netbook. This is a triple boot system which has Windows XP (the original operating system)  Windows 10 (which was an upgrade from Windows 7 ) and Ubuntu.apart from an issue with wireless networking not starting properly a few releases ago which has since been fixed without me doing anything everything has worked as expected so I have never needed to delve into the mysteries of terminal and Linux commands.However the upgrade from 17.04 to 17.10 has not worked as on booting up the system and selecting the Ubuntu option the  screen eventually stabilises with about 80% on the left hand side corrupted and the remaining 20% written correctly. I can select the drop down menu for shut down but  the pop up menu is obviously displayed in the corrupted bit. So I have to do a hard reset.Tips please on what to do next.
