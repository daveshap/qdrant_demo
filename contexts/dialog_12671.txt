DETECTIVE GRELEY: Hey Lieutenant, the boys in robbery have something I think you should look at.
BEDSOE: What is it?
DETECTIVE GRELEY: A tape from the surveillance camera at the First National Bank. It was robbed this morning.
BEDSOE: Really? I want to make sure that I understand what you're telling me, Greley. A crime was committed in New York City? That is news.
DETECTIVE GRELEY: The guy had a sword and was dressed like this guy.
DETECTIVE GRELEY: That's not all, Lieutenant. Wait until you see the tape. It's unbelievable.
BEDSOE: I'd like you to see this.
