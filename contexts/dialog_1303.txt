OZ: There's something I've been meaning to tell you, Heather.
HEATHER: What's that?
OZ: It's gonna sound really bad, but I want you to know.
HEATHER: This isn't the best way to proposition me.
OZ: No, that's not what I mean. I mean -- look. You know what made me leave that game? Coach was giving this speech, about not slacking off when you see the opportunity to score.
HEATHER: This isn't any better, Chris.
OZ: No, see Heather, what I realized is that...with you, it's not like I'm running towards the goal, trying to figure out the best way to score. And this may sound corny, but --
HEATHER: Oz, it's okay, I know.
OZ: You called me Oz.
HEATHER: Well, that's what your friends call you. I mean...I feel like I'm one of your friends now...and also...your girlfriend.
