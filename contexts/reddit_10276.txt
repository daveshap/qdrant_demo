Imagine how pleasant it would be to sleep forever
I don't want to die per say, but I also don't want to be alive. It's too hard and I'm not cut out for it. 

The only place where I feel relief is when I'm asleep. When I'm asleep nothing bothers me, nothing can hurt me. I just wish it could be like that forever.
