A year ago I was living in my car and had pretty much given up. This morning it dawned on me how far I've come when I had to struggle the find room for leftovers in my fridge.
Then this afternoon I had a tire blowout on the highway and I had enough saved up to replace it without having to skip meals for a while. I know I'm not totally afloat but it felt nice to have a minor victory over my situation today.
