ELLIOT: Where are you going?
NICKY: Don't wait Efor me.
ELLIOT: What about the haircut?
NICKY: You keep slipping away. How do you do that?
PAISLEY: I was one of those silent, listening children. Glued to the shadows.
NICKY: I was all noise. Played the radio loud. Battled constantly with my brother and sister. Here I am, world.
PAISLEY: I hear good things about the new play.
NICKY: So do I. Over and over.
PAISLEY: Peter Redmond is an actor I admire enormously.
NICKY: Would you like to meet him?
PAISLEY: He doesn't want to meet some out-of- work ingenue.
NICKY: I'm trying to prolong our afternoon. In case you haven't noticed.
PAISLEY: The fact is, I have to get going.
NICKY: Is it true?
PAISLEY: Is what true?
NICKY: He wears a disguise.
PAISLEY: Steven goes to extremes to protect his privacy. No friends. No phone.
NICKY: But you're his friend.
PAISLEY: Sort of. Sometimes. You're not building an obsession about Steven, are you? Look. I understand opening- night jitters, but you've got one of the great actors in American theater starring in your play.
