DAE feel beat down by their situation?

I’m feeling like I’m on a never ending hamster wheel of bills and debt that I’ll be paying for every remaining decade of my adult life. There’s not really a way out. So I guess I’ll just go to work again and serve food and drink to strangers so I can go ahead and make less than what my rent and bills cost.
