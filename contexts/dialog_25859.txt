CLAIRE: Hi. I hope I'm not disturbing...
JOE: She came in here, wait, she...I was giving her a massage...wait...Wait! She came in here...she... ...with respect...she took off her clothes, and she got in <u>bed</u>, I told her I could not--we don't know each other, you see...
CLAIRE: ...we had a script conference...
JOE: I told her Thank You Very Much, but it was inconvenient because...uh... because...
ANN: You can do it.
JOE: Because I'd met someone else.
ANN: Oh <u>okay</u>.
JOE: You believe that?
ANN: I do if you do.
JOE: But it's absurd.
ANN: So is our electoral process. But we still vote.
JOE: Do you truly believe the electoral process is absurd?
ANN: I used to go out with a politician.
JOE: You used to go out with him, you broke up with him?
ANN: Sure did.
JOE: Why?
ANN: Time for a change. Keep your margins straight.
JOE: Yes.
ANN: Go you Huskies!
