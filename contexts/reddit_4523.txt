I've been thinking about dying, not suicide, but finding another way to just die.
Hi, my name is Danielk, I will give you a quick summary of what's been going on.

A couple of years ago I was married and with a child, long story short, my wife was cheating with one of my best friends at the time, I found out that my daughter was his, and I went through depression as best as I possibly could, never had therapy of any sort though.

Back then I thought of killing myself, but never got the courage to do so.

Fast forward to january this year, I broke up with my girlfriend after three years of relationship, it wasn't anything messy, it was mostly that both of us are busy ( we are both working and in college) and decided it was best for us to split at the moment, we broke up in good terms.

Yet for the past few weeks I've been feeling really down, I don't eat much, I can barely sleep, and the thought of just dying has been in my mind constantly. 

I'm having a hard time understanding myself, this isn't even close to what happened before, but somehow, I feel the same or even worse. I don't want to kill myself, just die, like getting mugged or ran over by a bus or something. I've been engaging in dangerous practices, I walk out at night on shitty neighborhoods looking for something to happen, I just don't think I have energy to do anything anymore.

any advice? I feel this might be some strange case of ptsd, I dunno, I'm open to suggestions, and I am already looking for a therapist.

Thanks for your taking your time to read.
