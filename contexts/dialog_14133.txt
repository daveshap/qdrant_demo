LOVINGTON: We can't do the impossible, Mr. Andrews.
ANDREWS: What I'm asking isn't impossible. My daughter is somewhere between here and Miami. I want her found!
LOVINGTON: I've put extra men on, all along the way.
ANDREWS: It's not enough! Are you certain she's not with King Westley?
LOVINGTON: No. He's been trailed twenty-four hours a day since this thing started. He can't even get a phone call we don't know about.
ANDREWS: I'm worried, Lovington. After all, something might have happened to her.
