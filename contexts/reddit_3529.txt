UPDATE: A Tinder Story
First of all, I want to say thank you to everyone who liked, commented, supported, and/or messaged me. The past days has been a massive mix of excitement and nerves. But just forty minutes ago, I ordered an appetizer for us. Then I got up and got down on one knee. We were smacked dab in the middle of a busy restaurant. Everyone started looking, her hands covered her mouth. I asked her to marry me. 


AND SHE SAID YES!!!!!!!!

I feel so fucking blessed! (Sorry for the profanity). The entire restaurant clapped for us. The waitress said she will give us a free dessert if we want. My ~~girlfriend~~ fiancé is crying tears of joy and calling her family and is so excited she is asking wedding questions and venue stuff. She has had a venue planned ever since she was a little girl and wants a big wedding. I preordered it last week and she is getting the wedding of her dreams. 

I can’t wait to be a husband and a father. I’m just hungover in happiness. But I also want my shrimp bolognese to be done already.
