ST. LUC: I'm going to send you to the hospital to have a few X-rays taken. I want to find out exactly what you're hiding in there, OK? Give them this. The address is right there under Radiology.
PARKINS: Gonna cut me open?
ST. LUC: Well, let's wait for the X-rays.
PARKINS: Used to know a doctor who said he got to know his patients better than their wives did. Cutting a man open sure does expose more of him than pulling down his pants, gotta admit that.
JANINE: Hi.
BETTS: Hi. Want a drink?
JANINE: No thanks. Just wanted to tell you that Dr. St. Luc is coming up to see Nick at ten or so.
BETTS: Was he nice to you?
