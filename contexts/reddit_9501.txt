Digging myself out of a hole made for a stressful month.
Last month was a rough one financially. I had to buy a suit and have it rush-altered in time for my grandfather's funeral. I was due for new glasses/contact lenses, and required a pretty pricey prescription, and my insurance didn't cover nearly as much as I was expecting. All in all, I had about $1,000 in expenses that I wasn't expecting. It more than wiped out my savings, and for the first time in a few years, I couldn't pay my credit card balance down to $0 before the statement posted. 

The past month and a half has been lean as I've been trying to climb out of the hole. I've eaten a lot of the same meals over and over again, cleaned out my fridge and pantry to make sure not to spend any more than I had to, and cancelled plans because worrying about the cost outweighed the fun I would have.

But payday is on Tuesday, and that will bring me back to the black, with enough to get me through until next payday on an only slightly reduced budget. Unless, of course, my upcoming doctor appointment ends up costing more than I expected, which it definitely will.

Like I said, it's been tough. However, I will acknowledge that I'm in a better spot than many of the people I see posting here. I'm healthy and single with no kids, have a separate bank account for housing repairs, and another for student loan payments, that I could have dipped into if I saw no way out. I am climbing out solely through my "living expenses" budget. I have very good benefits through work, so my commute and health insurance weren't a money suck. I have friends and family who would have loaned me money if I truly got into a situation I had no way out of, so a safety net existed.

To all those of who who live daily with my experiences the last month or so, and to those of you have it harder, I'm awed by you. I know finding the strength to get through it isn't optional, but it is strength nonetheless.
