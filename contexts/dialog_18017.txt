VIRGINIA: You really think Sheldon's out there?
BUSTER: Hope not--if he is, he's dead. Let's go to the newspaper office.
ANNIE: Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.
PAUL: It's fine.
ANNIE: They had it at the store, Paul, there was a whole batch of them there. As soon as I saw it, I slammed my money down. I got the first copy.
PAUL: Then the roads are open...
ANNIE: The one to town is, but that's about it. I called the hospital and talked to the head orthopedic surgeon. I told him who you were and what had happened. He said as long as there's no infection, you're not in any danger, and as soon as the road to the hospital is open, they'll send an ambulance for you.
PAUL: The phones are working?
ANNIE: Well, mine's still out. But the ones in town were working just fine. I called that agent of yours. Oh, Paul, I peeked at the very beginning. What a wonderful first page--just to read the name Misery Chastain...
PAUL: My daughter must be going nuts.
ANNIE: ...it's like a visit from my oldest, dearest friend.
PAUL: I was supposed to be home for her birthday three days ago.
ANNIE: Your agent said she would tell her you were okay. But I'm afraid you'll have to wait until tomorrow if you want to speak to her yourself.
