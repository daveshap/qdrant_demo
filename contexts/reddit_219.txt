19 year Old dont know what to do
im 19 currently studying auto tech and i started in January. not sure if I wanna work on cars for the rest of my life though. i know what ur thinking. why did you put yourself in the course if youre not sure? well im not sure myself, i had scenarios in my head of me doing this and that and working on cars but the more i gave it some thought the more i thought about my future and working and it just doesnt feel like this is for me. how did you guys figure out what you wanted to do? I thought about becoming a nurse maybe or doing something related to the public but my filipinop arents think im trying to escape my problems. i just think im trying to figure out who i am. thanks
