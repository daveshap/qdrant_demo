What do I say when asked in an interview “What about this job interests you?” when the only reason I want the job is because I will be getting paid?
I’ve come to the conclusion that I am not passionate about anything that would make me money and I’m totally happy with just getting any job out of college that pays me relatively what my degree should be getting me. So when in an interview and they ask me what I find intriguing about this job (one example is IT Audit) what do I say to that?
