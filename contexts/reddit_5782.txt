How to act in a situation when you know you will lose your job?
I am currently on my annual leave and one of colleagues just informed me that managers are planning to sack me as soon as I rejoin the office. I have verified this with a senior manager who said they were having discussions about it as well. So it seems like I’ll be shown the door. It has only been 3 months in the office and I’m still in probation as of now. 

How do I act in such a situation? From where do I get the motivation to go back to work? Is it a big setback for my career even though it’s probation period for now? 

I’m having some serious headache after learning about this.
