Let's be honest
I absolutely HATED the admissions process, and it has completely drained me. It was the most difficult thing I have ever had to do. I can literally feel emotional and mental exhaustion, especially since I applied to 17 Colleges, that too as an International Student asking for tons of financial aid

However, this process has really really helped me discover who I truly am. I have explored myself like never before. I feel like I have an identity now. I feel more mature, more aware of the world around me. I've understood how my childhood has shaped me to become who I am today, and how my high school experiences have contributed so much meaning to my life.

The two months of hell were for the better then, I guess.

PS: I really hope I get accepted somewhere
