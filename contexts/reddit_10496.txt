i’m killing myself by the end of this week
i wanted to do it tonight but as i type this, i’m realizing again it’s my older brothers birthday. i don’t want his birthday to be a never ending memory of his 16 year old sister killing herself on the same day.

i’m scared. i know that there’s never an easy way to kill yourself, not unless your assisted but even then it’s not easy especially when it’s illegal. i think i might overdose. i’m just scared of throwing up. maybe that makes me stupid, a coward and stupidly suicidal.

i’m really done. i never realized what people meant when they talked about the mental health care system being shit, i mean, i’ve been diagnosed with severe depression, different kinds of anxieties and borderline personality disorder for the last few years (and didn’t think much of it) until i realized that how i was feeling and acting was FAR from normal so i tried to get help. why wait 3 months for another therapy appointment that never ends up helping, if i can just kill myself in those three months? there’s no point to anything anymore, i have no reason to live. besides, i’ve tried to kill myself twice already. (though, they obviously didn’t work.)

third times a charm, right?

EDIT: i wish i could say that my mental health is the only thing bringing me down. im tired of living in a world where i was sexually assaulted, i’m tired of being abused, i’m tired of having fear of seeing my father and his family. i don’t want pity, i really am just tired. i’m scared of myself and the future
