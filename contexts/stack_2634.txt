ArcGIS Map Package editing I created a map package on my desktop, and copied the folder containing it and a geodatabase containing feature classes that were in the map to my laptop. On my laptop version, I edited one of the feature classes. When I copied my laptop version of the map package back to my desktop (to a different folder than the original) and opened it, it did not show the edited version of my feature class, but rather the original feature class. I assumed that the edits I made were being made to the geodatabase that I copied to the laptop and that the map package would have referenced that. But it did not. Apparently, when you make a map package, it packages up all files, whether or not you 'pack' them with it in the folder you're transferring to another computer. Is it not good practice to use a map package as a working copy, when editing features? Should I have saved a copy of the map package as an .mxd, then packaged that before transferring it back to my desktop? How could I have avoided this problem?
