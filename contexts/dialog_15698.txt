DR. LECTER: That expires in one week. You're not real FBI, are you?
CLARICE: I'm - still in training at the Academy.
DR. LECTER: Jack Crawford sent a trainee to me?
CLARICE: We're talking about psychology, Doctor, not the Bureau. Can you decide for yourself whether or not I'm qualified?
DR. LECTER: Mmmmm... That's rather slippery of you, Officer Starling. Sit. Please.
DR. LECTER: Now then. What did Miggs say to you? Multiple Miggs
CLARICE: He said - I can smell your cunt.""
DR. LECTER: I see. I myself cannot. You use Evyan skin cream, and sometimes you wear L'Air du Temps, but not today. You brought your best bag, though, didn't you?
CLARICE: Yes.
DR. LECTER: It's much better than your shoes.
CLARICE: Maybe they'll catch up.
DR. LECTER: I have no doubt of it.
CLARICE: Did you do those drawings, Doctor?
DR. LECTER: Yes. That's the Duomo, seen from the Belvedere. Do you know Florence?
CLARICE: All that detail, just from memory...?
DR. LECTER: Memory, Officer Starling, is what I have instead of view.
CLARICE: Dr. Lecter, if you'd please consider -
DR. LECTER: No, no, no. You were doing fine, you'd been courteous and receptive to courtesy, you'd established trust with the embarrassing truth about Miggs, and now this ham-handed segue into your questionnaire. It won't do. It's stupid and boring.
CLARICE: I'm only asking you to look at this, Doctor. Either you will or you won't.
DR. LECTER: Jack Crawford must be very busy indeed if he's recruiting help from the student body. Busy hunting that new one, Buffalo Bill... Such a naughty boy! Did Crawford send you to ask for my advice on him?
CLARICE: No, I came because we need -
DR. LECTER: How many women has he used, our Bill?
CLARICE: Five... so far.
DR. LECTER: All flayed...?
CLARICE: Partially, yes. But Doctor, that's an active case, I'm not involved. If -
DR. LECTER: Do you know why he's called Buffalo Bill? Tell me. The newspapers won't say.
CLARICE: I'll tell you if you'll look at this form. It started as a bad joke in Kansas City Homicide. They said... this one likes to skin his humps.
DR. LECTER: Witless and misleading. Why do you think he takes their skins, Officer Starling? Thrill me with your wisdom.
CLARICE: It excites him. Most serial killers keep some sort of trophies.
DR. LECTER: I didn't.
CLARICE: No. You ate yours.
