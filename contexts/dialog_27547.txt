ENZO: I tell you she's mine!
JOHANA: Hello!
ENZO: You know each other?
JOHANA: Yes.
ENZO: Enzo Molinari.
ENZO: This is a great pleasure.
JOHANA: Johana Cross, pleased to meet you. Well! Isn't this a coincidence. I really wasn't expecting this... All the way out here. It's incredible!
JACQUES: Please, have a seat.
JOHANA: Thank you. I wouldn't want to interrupt anything.
JACQUES: No, no!
ENZO: Not at all!
JACQUES: You're staying at the hotel?
JOHANA: I wish, but it's full. They recommended a pension in town. They say that all of Taormina is full. What's going on here?
ENZO: It's the Free Diving World Championship. I am by the way world champion!
JACQUES: But what brought you to Sicily?
JOHANA: I was doing an insurance investigation in Palermo. I work for an insurance company. So, I decided to take a few days off. I don't know this island at all. It really is gorgeous.
