Software/app for interviews?
Hey! I am interviewing a few individuals for a project I'm working on, and was wondering what programs you have used in the past to record audio from Skype calls and phone calls?

 Must be in MP3 file format so I can use a transcript service. Must also be very reliable and good quality audio.

 TIA!
