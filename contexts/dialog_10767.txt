PATTERSON: Why do the workers look unhappy?
SAMUEL: Because they are here. Because Tsavo is the worst place in the world. Come, John- to the bridge.
PATTERSON: It's all wonderfully under control, Samuel- you've done a splendid job.
SAMUEL: Thank you. The truth is this: you have to work at it constantly.
PATTERSON: The workers don't get on?
SAMUEL: Get on? They detest each other. Obviously the Africans hate the Indians. But the Indians also hate the other Indians. Some of them worship cows, while others eat them.
