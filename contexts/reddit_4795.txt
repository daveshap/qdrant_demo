My grandmother is starving herself to death.
My grandmother (90F) is starving herself to death. She definitely has depression, which I have also (I suspect I got it from her...). Her sister starved herself to death five years ago. 

She weighs about 60 lb at this point. Her husband tries to get her to eat but she refuses to eat more than a few bites. She threatens to slit her wrists and has been threatening it for 30 years. 

What can I do? This is weighing on me so much. I canâ€™t stand seeing her waste away. I feel like she has so little time left.
