HARRY: Hello, Doris.
DORIS: Harry Zimm. You look like a wet kiss.
DORIS: Well, aren't you gonna offer me whatever it is you taste like?
HARRY: Come on in.
DORIS: What a spectacular view.
HARRY: Yeah, lovely. Last night I watched two guys carjack a Camaro down on the corner of Argyle there. What do you want, Doris?
DORIS: I miss Murray, Harry.
HARRY: Yeah, me too. He was a helluva good writer. And I would know. I discovered him. Made him what he was.
DORIS: What he was, was a hack, couldn't get a job writing for anybody but you. I'm being honest. He was a lousy writer, but he was a good husband. I just didn't know it until too late.
