What does global structure refers to in deep neural nets? In deep learning book (8th chapter, section 8.2.7), while explaining the challenges in neural nets optimization, the authors argued that currently researchers are focusing on finding the good initial points of parameters. They wrote that:<blockquote>  Many existing research directions are aimed at finding good initial points for  problems that have difficult global structure, rather than at developing algorithms that use nonlocal moves.</blockquote>I do not understand what does it mean by difficult global structure? How can we evaluate if the problem that neural nets are going to solve have difficult global structure? Moreover, I do not understand what do they mean by 'developing algorithms that use nonlocal moves'?
