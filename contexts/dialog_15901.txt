JACK: Oona tells me the raven has roosted for the night on a sharp stone spire some half a mile distance.
GUMP: That would be Devil's Needle. Last landmark I know in these woods.
SCREWBALL: Ogg lives there...! And Thurgis!
GUMP: Screwball! Be quiet...! We have friends live 'neath the Needle. They'll no doubt provide safe refuge for the night.
JACK: Good.
GUMP: Beyond Devil's Needle, all is unknown.
JACK: Twould appear other travelers precede us.
GUMP: Nay, Jack, tis not what you're thinking.
JACK: I trust our own welcome will be more hospitable.
GUMP: Jack, Jack, it's dwarves live here. Hard-working chaps. Hammering in the forge all the live-long day. Make the most wondrous things, they do.
JACK: And this? Some of their handiwork?
GUMP: Nay. That's but to distract the casual visitor. A dwarf is too busy to suffer fools gladly.
JACK: Better to kill than be disturbed.
GUMP: Your imagination runs away with you, Jack... Those bones be but battlefield gleanings, like I mentioned. A wee bit of carrion to frighten off the uninvited.
JACK: Here is a bold champion's reward; to serve as a dwarf's doorstop.
SCREWBALL: What care the bones when the soul is free?
JACK: Bah! You faeries have the morals of ferrets.
