Looking to develop new skills that could lead to Work-At-Home opportunities
I currently work as a painter (paint homes, condos, etc.) but I've always wanted to work from home. For personal reasons, I want to make it my goal to mostly work from home within the next couple of years.Â 

I'd like to explore different options on what type of work is out there. Either it be freelancing, contractual, or working for a company. As I do have income requirements, these options would need to at least pay my living expenses in a MCOL/HCOL area.

I know it will come down to what skills I posses. I do have accounting experience, but I'd like to take the time to learn new skills. School isn't the best option for me at this time (student debt and like to stay home when I'm off). However I'm decent when it comes to learning something on my own.

Would like to hear from you guys on what you think!

Thanks in advanced.
