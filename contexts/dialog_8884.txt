FRANK: Well, look at this.
DONNA: You bring trunks, Jack?
JACK: Trunks?
DONNA: Swimming trunks.
JACK: Oh. No. Strictly dryland.
DONNA: Too bad. You could use some sun. Really.
JACK: Maybe next time.
DONNA: We have some lotion.
JACK: Just the same.
DONNA: Suit yourself.
FRANK: Nice, huh?
JACK: What?
FRANK: The trees. The flowers. Nice.
JACK: Terrific.
FRANK: Yeah ... we're gonna paint in the spring. After the rains. Look good as new.
JACK: You ask me out here to sell me your house, Frank?
JACK: Charlie paid you off last night, didn't he?
FRANK: I don't know what you mean.
JACK: The hell you don't.
FRANK: I told you. Something came up. Some political dinner or something.
JACK: Bullshit. Fifteen years, Frank. No one paid us off.
FRANK: It wasn't like that.
JACK: No?
FRANK: No.
JACK: What was it like?
FRANK: Hey pal, I got a mortgage, all right? I got two kids. I got a wife. Besides, he made the deal. There's no shame in it.
JACK: That how you see it?
