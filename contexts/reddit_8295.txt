How Serious is Climate Change/Global Warming and to What Extent Are Humans Causing It?
I come from a conservative family, and my parents come close to [Trump's views on Climate Change] (https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/265895292191248385?lang=en). A lot of liberals think Climate Change is [major](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2016/9/20/1572203/-The-Issue-that-Could-Decide-the-Election-Climate-Change-Humanity-s-Existential-Threat), even [existential](http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/terence-p-jeffrey/obama-climate-change-genuine-existential-threat-we-all-face) crisis, while many/most conservatives think it is either an [overblown liberal talking point](http://www.heritage.org/issues/energy-and-environment/climate-change), [part of a leftist agenda to expand government](http://dailycaller.com/2015/04/20/limbaugh-climate-change-one-of-the-biggest-scams-ever-perpetrated-on-the-people-of-the-world-audio/), or doesn't exist.



 So, my question is, objectively, how serious is the threat of Climate Change/Global Warming, and how much are humans actually causing it? I personally don't deny the science behind it, the greenhouse effect, and I have a general, vague idea of the changes in weather patterns that are said to be caused by it, but how much is [natural shift]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Ice_Age) in temperature/climate, and how much is caused by humans. I want to protect the environment,I'm against pollution, and I am not a fan of the oil/gas industry but I am suspicious of the liberal urgency and position on it.

Trump and other top Republicans have been saying EPA Regulations actually hurt US companies.
Here's Trump's quote about the EPA:
