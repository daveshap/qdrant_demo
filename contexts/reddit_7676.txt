Halfway point in Master's, do I quit or tough it out? Will it be worth it?
I'm 5 classes and a Master's thesis away from finishing but I'm unsure of this degree as an investment. It would be an MA in Global Inclusion & Social Development. I am already $12k in debt and finishing would cost another $12k. I thought my current job would have better tuition remission, nope. 

It'd be 1.5 years more of working full time and studying part time. I'm not sure I want to make the free time and financial sacrifices for a degree I'm not sure will benefit me in the long run. Though I do like the courses. 

People have told me a Master's degree will help eventually in pay increases and job prospects by ticking off that box.

I hope to work for a humanitarian / international dev NGO org. I'm 34 though and time is ticking and I have some good work experience in the field of social services.

What would you do? Thanks in advance for your thoughts.
