COBB: I can't hold out on you any longer. Lamb bites wolf. Beautiful.
LONGFELLOW: Only common sense.
CEDAR: I can't hold out any longer either, Mr. Deeds. Being an attorney for you will be a very simple affair.
LONGFELLOW: You're not my attorney yet, Mr. Cedar. Not till I find out what's on your mind. Suppose you get the books straightened out quick so I can have a look at them.
CEDAR: Yes, of course, if you wish. But you must be prepared. This sort of thing will be daily routine. If it becomes annoying, you let me know. Goodbye, Mr. Deeds. Goodbye, sir.
