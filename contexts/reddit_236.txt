What next
Hello everyone.

I have a very severe problem. You see, about 3 months ago me and my mom moved into a foreign country. Where I come from. Torrenting is legal for personal use... I did not know it was illegal here. I think you see where this is going. I torrented 2 movies and my mom and her boyfriend got a 900 euro fine. For one of the movies, they started to pay it off but it still caused problems as we have to pay it by 18.2 and that's only 2 weeks from now.
Yesterday I got another fine but before my parents could see it I hid it in my closet. Now they have to pay 1700 euro. By the 19.2

Im so fucking lost on what to do. I'm 13 and can't get a job yet because I don't know the language of the country I'm currently in well enough. 

I received the paper 1 day ago and the first paper 6 days ago. I'm scared shitless and lost on what to do. My parents come home in about 2 hrs

Please any advice
