DREIBERG: Who?
VEIDT: I don't know, but . . . in the wake of all that's happened, I'm starting to think Rorschach may have been right. Is Laurie okay?
DREIBERG: She's with me.
VEIDT: Good. Be careful, Daniel, don't let up your guard. Look, I'm going to head south for a while -- hole up at Karnak until all this blows over. You two would be welcome to join me.
DREIBERG: Thanks for the offer, Adrian. I'll let you know.
LAURIE: Ohh. I could use some dinner. Who was that on the phone?
DREIBERG: One more down. Someone tried to kill Adrian. . . . First time I've ever heard him scared.
DREIBERG: -- What is it.
LAURIE: I know what you're thinking. You'd be a lot safer if I weren't around.
DREIBERG: Laurie --
LAURIE: I'm an open target, Dan. If you're with me --
DREIBERG: With any luck, the world'll end before we get ours.
