Announcing our Debate Fact-Checking Initiative
We have been thinking about how best to approach the Presidential debates, and have decided that we are going to post live fact-checking threads for at least the first Presidential debate (after which we'll assess and see how it went).  

In deciding on this, we have looked at our past megathreads, such as for the primary election results, primary debates, convention speeches, and the Brexit vote.

The megathread format we most often used, some introductory questions and then a live tick-tock works great for election nights, but not as well for debates and speeches.  So we're gonna try something new.

The way it will work is as follows:

* **All top level comments will be posted by mods.**

Top level comments will contain a quote from one or both candidates transcribed by one of us while watching the debate.  Obviously this will be live so there may be errors.  But to avoid duplications, this will be done only by the mod team.

* **Users can reply to mod comments with a fact check of the candidate statement.**

All fact checks **must** contain a link to a source stating what the true thing is, and must also clearly explain why it contradicts or confirms what the candidate said.  Replies to top level comments without a link will be summarily removed.

* **Users can then reply to each other in third-level and above comments**

Normal NeutralPolitics rules will still apply.

*Edit for clarification* Since this has come up a couple times: The NP mod team will not be doing the fact checking, but we are rather providing a forum for our users to fact check.  The only thing we're doing in an "official" capacity is transcribing the candidate statements.  We report; you fact check.
