GRADY: Hm.
JAMES LEER: How did I get here last night?
GRADY: No one seems to know where you live, James. Hannah thought you'd like my couch.
JAMES LEER: And... and before that. Did I do anything? Anything bad?
GRADY: Well, James, you did shoot the Head of the English Department's dog and steal his most prized piece of memorabilia.
