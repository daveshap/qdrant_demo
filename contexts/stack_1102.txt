Linked Server - Double Hop - Kerberos - TCP I am having trouble with a Linked Server. I would typically not use a linked server, but legacy issues are forcing my hand.I am attempting to set up a linked server between two new production SQL servers. I have configured SQL on both machines with domain service accounts running MSSQLSvc on each respective SQL instance.The domain service accounts have SPNs registered; I have verified this through AD attribute editor(sp?). I can perform single hop queries on the actual servers, but no luck with the double hop from my laptop (domain admin).I have used the Kerberos Config tool on each server and configured what I can. This is where google falls short on this issue. When I use the Kerberos Config Tool on one of the servers I get this for my service account running MSSQLsvc; \"TCP must be enabled to use Kerberos authentication\".In the SQL server config manager, I have TCP/IP enabled. I have restarted services and the server on several occasions. Any thoughts? I can provide more information.
