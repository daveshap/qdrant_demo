NURSE: You're awake. Good girl.
KIRSTY: What happened to me?
NURSE: I'll get the doctor.
KIRSTY: Wait a moment --
KIRSTY: Who brought me in here?
NURSE: I won't be a moment.
DOCTOR: Please. Get back into bed.
KIRSTY: I have to speak to my father.
DOCTOR: That's easily arranged. But first, back into bed.
KIRSTY: It's important.
DOCTOR: You took quite a beating. You must lie down.
KIRSTY: Please listen to me --
DOCTOR: First things first. You can have a telephone when we've talked. Do you know who did this to you?
