JUDY: Scottie, why are we here?
SCOTTIE: I told you. I have to go back into the past. Once more. For the last time.
JUDY: But why? Why here?
SCOTTIE: Madeleine died here.
JUDY: No, I don't want to go. I want to stay here.
SCOTTIE: I need you.
JUDY: Why?
SCOTTIE: I can't do it alone. I need you, to be Madeleine for a while. Then, when it's done, we'll both be free.
JUDY: I'm scared.
SCOTTIE: So am I, But it has to be done. I have to tell you about Madeleine, now.
