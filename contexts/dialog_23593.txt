GEORGE: How long you had this?
JACKIE: Oh, about six weeks now... Lester -- well, he's very sweet.
GEORGE: I'm sure.
JACKIE: He's a very private person, actually.
GEORGE: Yeah -- he doesn't happen to know that we went together, does he?
JACKIE: -- Well no. It never came up.
GEORGE: You going to tell him?
JACKIE: -- What for? Honey, I'll see you later.
JACKIE: Jill, you're a real sweetie pie. You really are. You're sure you don't mind?
JILL: Don't be silly.
JACKIE: You're really a love -- you sure?
JILL: -- No. No really.
JACKIE: Well, what is it, honey?
JILL: Nothing.
JACKIE: It must be something.
JILL: Well, it's George.
JACKIE: I thought you said things were great with George.
JILL: Well they are. But we have problems. You say things are great with Lester. Is he going to marry you?
JACKIE: We don't think marriage is important.
JILL: But you have problems?
JACKIE: -- Yeah, honey...
JILL: I don't know. One minute he's up in the air and makes love to me five times a day and tells me everything's going to be great and he's getting his own shop and then suddenly he disappears and he won't even talk to me. It's driving me crazy.
JACKIE: Five times a day?
JILL: -- I guess it's all got to do with this shop.
JACKIE: Really, Jill, aren't you exaggerating just a little? Five times a day?
JILL: Well, you know what I mean.
JACKIE: After four years? No I don't... and I don't know too many girls who do.
JILL: I'm exaggerating.
JACKIE: How much?
JILL: Jackie --
JACKIE: What?
JILL: Well... it's not so much the number of times he does it, it's... he does it for a long time.
JACKIE: He does?
JILL: Well yes -- you know that about George.
JACKIE: It's been so long I don't how long?
JILL: Quite a while... an hour, an hour and a half -- sometimes forty-five minutes -- that's quite a while, isn't It?
JACKIE: I would say so, yes.
JILL: Honey?
JACKIE: What?
JILL: I think you're going to hit that car in front of us.
JILL: -- See, I just know that if I go to Egypt, well, things happen, I just don't know what'll happen to us, he just never seems to think ahead, does he?
JACKIE: -- When you say forty-five minutes or an hour, do you mean continuous time? Just continually, without stopping?
JILL: -- Well -- not going in and out, I don't mean just that. Why are you asking me? You went with George longer than I have.
JACKIE: -- I guess I just blocked it out, that's all.
JILL: C'mon.
JACKIE: Well, there was this one time --
JILL: -- Yesss?
JACKIE: -- I was in the kitchen doing the dishes and George was out in Long Beach doing a show...
JILL: -- uhh-huhh...
JACKIE: -- Well it was very hot so I'd left the door open and the water was running so I didn't hear him come down the stairs...
JILL: ... Mmm-hmmm.
JACKIE: -- He came up behind me and I was wiping a dish and he just... lifted up my skirt, and, you know, right there...
JILL: Didn't you have any panties on?
JACKIE: -- He reached up and tore them.
JILL: What did you do?
JACKIE: Well... I just kept wiping that dish. Maybe it doesn't sound very sexy but it was.
JILL: No, it sounds very sexy -- did you just stay by the sink all that time?
JACKIE: No, he picked me up and carried me out to the sundeck -- God, it was hot. The wood on the sundeck, everything.
LESTER: Do you think George is a fairy?
FELICIA: Who?
LESTER: That kid... the hairdresser.
FELICIA: Well, I don't know for sure... he's a hairdresser.
