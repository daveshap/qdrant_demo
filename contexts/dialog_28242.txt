MOTHER: Henryk, I said nothing bad.
HENRYK: What's the matter with you all? Have you lost your sense of humour?
SZPILMAN: It's not funny.
HENRYK: Well, you know what's funny? You're funny with that ridiculous tie.
SZPILMAN: What are you talking about, my tie? What's my tie got to do with anything? I need the tie for my work.
MOTHER: Boys, boys...
HENRYK: Your work, yes, playing the piano for all the parasites in the ghetto, they don't give a damn about people's sufferings, they don't even notice what's going on around them!
