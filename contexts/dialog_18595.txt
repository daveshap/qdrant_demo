ALEX: You feel it? It's different this time.
NICK: We're actually inside, aren't we?
NICK: Okay. Give us a kiss?
ALEX: One. In case...
NICK: Don't even say it.

NICK: That's what I was hoping you'd say.
NICK: I'll take the lead and handle the physical threats. You watch the elapsed time and look for exits.
ALEX: Got it.
