SIEGEL: Everybody's talkin' about ya, Charlie. First time anybody ever got took for a ride and lived.
LUCIANO: Guess I'm just lucky.
SIEGEL: That's just what they're calling ya pal. Lucky Luciano.
FRANK: Masseria's confused. He can't figure whether you're workin' for Maranzano, or gettin' ready to kill the bastard. So he's spreadin' the word that you're goin' after Profaci because it happened on his turf. I figure Masseria's gonna try to rub out Profaci, and pin it on us. Then Maranzano will have to kill ya.
LUCIANO: You got men on Profaci's place?
FRANK: We got our boys paintin' the house next door. Around the clock. We're gonna keep old man Profaci alive if it takes twenty coats.
LANSKY: Tommy Reina's gone over to Maranzano, but so far Masseria ain't lifted a finger,
LUCIANO: The fat man's scared. Scared of us, and scared without us. Same with Maranzano. We gotta get their minds back on each other. This fuckin' peace is killin' us.
LANSKY: We can get the war started tomorrow, but it won't be pretty.
LUCIANO: Who?
LANSKY: Tommy Reina.
SIEGEL: What you mean? Tommy ain't done nothin'.
LANSKY: Maranzano will think Masseria ordered the hit, and won't have no choice but to start the war.
SIEGEL: Why's it gotta be Tommy!
LANSKY: Masseria won't have any choice but to trust you. And as long as we keep the Boss alive, Maranzano can't win without you.
