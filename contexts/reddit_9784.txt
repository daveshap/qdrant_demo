What are good undergraduate majors to apply for a Student Affairs graduate program?
[1]  I am currently a psychology major, and I have the time to add another major/degree. I was looking at Kinesiology & Health Promotion. Are there any other ideas? 
[2]  Ideally I would like to be a career/academic advisor, but I am also open to being a guidance counselor for high schools or giving presentations about health wellness. Also, are there any other masters programs related to these careers that I could look into?
