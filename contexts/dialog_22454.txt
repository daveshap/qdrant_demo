STEVE: -- and even if I do learn to read, what use'll it be? I'm goin' to live on a ranch!
MARY: There's plenty of use for reading -- you'll see.
STEVE: U-n-i-c-o-r-n-... What in heck's that?
MARY: Unicorn -- a kind of animal --
STEVE: What do they look like?
MARY: Hmmm... sort of like a horse -- with a horn in the center of its forehead.
STEVE: Horses with horns! Huh! Do we have 'em in Nevada?
MARY: No.
STEVE: How about California?
MARY: Would they be good to eat?
MARY: Kind of tough, I guess... But you're not liable to hunt them -- I don't think there's any alive now, anyways -- and I'm not sure but I don't think there ever were...
STEVE: Then if they wasn't alive, how can they be an animal?...
STEVE: An' if you can't hunt 'em and even if you could they'd be tough, what's the use of knowin' how to spell them?
MARY: You don't read to fill your stomach... Poetry, for instance. All the poems in the world wouldn't fill you half as much as a bowl of eatmeal -- but they make you feel good.
STEVE: I feel good anyways.
CLAY: Don't go arguing with your teacher.
STEVE: I'm not, but there's some of it I don't see any sense to.
CLAY: There's a lot of things I don't see any sense to. But make up your mind. Learn to read or -- -- go back and watch the horses.
MARY: Well, Steve?
STEVE: Now I know what a unicorn is, what do we do next?
