DUNCAN: Welcome back, sir. How was the vacation?
SALINAS: Takes four days to chill, then its time to come back. Is that...?
DUNCAN: Yeah.
MACKELWAY: Good morning, sir. Agent Salinas, sir.
SALINAS: So you're the new meat?
MACKELWAY: Yes, sir.
SALINAS: What did you do to end up here?
MACKELWAY: I believe it's in my file, sir.
SALINAS: Johnny, get this man's file. Mackelway, right?
MACKELWAY: Thomas Mackelway.
SALINAS: Hot enough for you, Agent Mackelway? Hell's doorknob. What they got you doing?
MACKELWAY: Updating the condition of all Bureau- owned vehicles in the southwest sector, sir.
SALINAS: Sounds like fun.
SALINAS: Computer Investigation and Infrastructure Assessment Center." Quantico out of MIT -- you're a techie? Okay
MACKELWAY: I screwed up twice, sir.
SALINAS: I see that. Washington to Philadelphia to here. Philly's a nice station. How many agents?
MACKELWAY: Four hundred and sixty, sir.
SALINAS: Attitude Adjustment Issues" -- what the fuck is that supposed to mean?"
MACKELWAY: I wished to be reinstated at Computer Crimes. I was undiplomatic in my request.
SALINAS: This is a first. You criticized the Deputy Director to his face and you still have a badge? You must have some one-of-a-kind skills. Why don't you just quit? I mean, you're not going to get promoted, not wearing this jacket.
MACKELWAY: I like working for the Bureau, sir. I like catching bad guys. It's all I care about.
SALINAS: Jesus, just what I need, another blue flamer. Johnny, get this boy some sun screen.
SALINAS: Agent Duncan, there's an interstate issue up on 54, run out there.
DUNCAN: I'm babysitting the DEA guys this afternoon, Casio and I. You said that was top priority.
SALINAS: Agent Mackelway, you want to get off your ass and do something for a change?
MACKELWAY: Yes, sir.
SALINAS: Got a vehicle? Head north on 54. When you get to New Mexico you've gone too far.
