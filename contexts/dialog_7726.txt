LORETTA: What is wrong with you?
AMBER: I don't know. I just didn't wanna win like this.
LORETTA: You stop right there. You are a good person. Good things happen to good people.
AMBER: Really?
LORETTA: No. It's pure bullshit, sweetie. You're lucky as hell, so you might as well enjoy it. Let's get you a root beer float.
AMBER: Okay.
LORETTA: Do you guys want some shots? I'm buyin'.
AMBER: I never liked her, but she didn't deserve to die in the belly of a swan like that. The whole thing's just kinda sad and lame at the same time.
LORETTA: This came for you, sweetie.
AMBER: Ah! It's from State! Oh my God!
AMBER: It's all the stuff I get to do. Oh my God, oh my God... Okay, okay... We get a personal consultation" with a make-up artist -- Eeeh! Okay
LORETTA: What? For chrissakes, spit it out.
AMBER: I'll be stayin' overnight at... The Airport Howard Johnsons!
LORETTA: Right by the airport -- Oh, Amber...
AMBER: There's an indoor swimming pool! Ahhhh!
