BIG NURSE: At the close of Friday's meeting, we were discussing Mister Harding's problem, concerning his wife... Mister Harding stated that his wife made him uneasy because she drew stares from men on the street. Is that correct, Mister Harding?
HARDING: Yes, that's perfectly correct.
BIG NURSE: He also thinks he may have given her reason to seek sexual attention elsewhere, but he didn't say how. He has been heard to say to his wife, 'I hate you, I don't ever want to see you again. You've betrayed me.' So. Does anyone care to touch upon this further?
BIG NURSE: Mister McMurphy, this ward is a democratic community run by the patients and their votes, so you should feel at ease in your new surroundings to the extent you can freely discuss emotional problems in front of the patients and staff. However, the cardinal rule, and I must emphasize this: Everyone keeps their seat during the meeting!
MCMURPHY: Yeah, well, it just pains me somethin' awful to see a full growed man sloshing around in his own water...
BIG NURSE: Yes... We were discussing Mister Harding's problem with his wife. Now, who will start? Billy.
BILLY: M-m-m-ma'am?
BIG NURSE: Would you like to start?
BILLY: N-n-n-n-n-no, ma'am.
BIG NURSE: Mister Sefelt?
