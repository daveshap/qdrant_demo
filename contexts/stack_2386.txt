How to restore java minecraft server after power outage I just experienced a power outage and I lost my multiplayer Minecraft Java server world (which I've spent a ton of time crafting).   When I restarted the server after the outage, a new world map was generated.  Unfortunately, I don't have any backups (that I'm aware of)  I'm in my \"world\" directory and have some files in the \"region\"and \"player data\" directory that were saved before the outage.  Can these be used to restore the world?Any help would be greatly appreciated!!!
