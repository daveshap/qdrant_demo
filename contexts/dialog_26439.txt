LARA: -- as the keeper of the archives of Krypton, it falls to me to tell you of the darkest episode in our planets history.
LUTHOR: Now This I want to hear.
LARA: For many eons the peoples of our world have lived together in harmony. Then there appeared among us three anti-social elements - what on Earth are classified as criminals.""
LUTHOR: My kind of people.
LARA: The three proved - after exhaustive efforts - incapable of rehabilitation. Now as you know, we had no death penalty -
LUTHOR: Sensible enough.
LARA: And so our scientists constructed, from an irreversible mathematical equation, the Phantom Zone. In it we imprisoned these three arch-villains for all eternity.
LUTHOR: No possibility for parole?
LARA: The Elders have, of course, thought long and hard about that question.
LUTHOR: I asked the right question.
LARA: The one danger we have considered is that the Phantom Zone might - we cannot predict - just might be cracked by a nuclear explosion in space. I cannot say I am glad you asked me that -
LUTHOR: I didn't ask her anything . . .
