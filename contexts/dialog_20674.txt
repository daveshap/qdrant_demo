BARNEY: Hello, Lilla!
ELIZABETH: Peggy Sue!
BARNEY: Quite a bit more rain than usual this year. I hope it doesn't spoil the rhubarb.
ELIZABETH: I've already got some in. I was thinking of making a pie for dinner tonight. How would you like that?
PEGGY: Fine. ) Grandma, would you teach me how to make strudel?
ELIZABETH: That's a day's work. But if that's what you want, maybe we can do it tomorrow for your birthday.
