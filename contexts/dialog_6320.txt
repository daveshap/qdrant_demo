MR. LEWIS: Sorry, I --
JAKE: Jake. Jake Pearson. I go to lawschool with your daughter. Carolyn. We met once or twice.
MR. LEWIS: Of course. Jake. Nice to see you.
JAKE: Well, it certainly is a coincidence. Here of all places! How is Mrs. Lewis?
MR. LEWIS: Great. Thank you.
JAKE: Excuse me? I believe you're holding something far me under Pearson.
SALESGIRL: Do you have a ticket?
JAKE: You know, this is kind of embarrassing, but my wallet was stolen yesterday and I'm afraid the ticket was in it. But the name's Pearson.
