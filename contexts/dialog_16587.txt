CHANG: Charming, isn't she?
CONWAY: Yes, charming.
CHANG: Your brother seems quite fascinated by her.
CONWAY: Why not? She's an attractive young woman.
CHANG: Young? She arrived here in 1888. She was 20 at the time. She was on her way to join her betrothed - when her carriers lost their way in the mountains. The whole party would have perished but for meeting some of our people.
CONWAY: Amazing! She still doesn't look over 20. When is she likely to grow old in appearance?
CHANG: Not for years. Shangri-La will keep her youthful indefinitely.
CONWAY: Suppose she should leave it?
CHANG: Leave Shangri-La! That's not likely. You couldn't drive her out.
CONWAY: No, I mean about her appearance. If she should leave the valley - what would happen?
CHANG: Oh, she'd quickly revert in her appearance to her actual age.
CONWAY: It's weird. Chang, how old are you?
CHANG: Age is a limit we impose upon ourselves. You know, each time you Westerners celebrate your birthday, you build another fence around your minds.
