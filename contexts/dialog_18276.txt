ROSE'S VOICE: That's my house.
PERRY'S VOICE: You mean the whole house?
ROSE'S VOICE: Yes.
PERRY'S VOICE: My God, it's a mansion!
ROSE'S VOICE: It's a house.
PERRY'S VOICE: I live in a one-bedroom apartment. What exactly does your husband do?
ROSE'S VOICE: He's a plumber.
PERRY'S VOICE: Well. That explains it.
PERRY: Temperature's dropping.
ROSE: Yes.
PERRY: I guess you can't invite me in?
ROSE: No.
PERRY: People home.
ROSE: No. I think the house is empty. I can't invite you in because I'm married and because I know who I am. You're shaking.
PERRY: I'm a little cold.
ROSE: You're a little boy and you like to be bad.
PERRY: We could go to my apartment. You could see how the other half lives.
ROSE: I'm too old for you.
PERRY: I'm too old for me. That's my predicament.
ROSE: Good night.
PERRY: Good night. Can I kiss you on the cheek, too?
ROSE: Sure.
PERRY: I'm freezing
ROSE: Good night.
