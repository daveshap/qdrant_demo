How can I increase my income as an intl graduate student in Texas?
I'm an international student, and I'm starting my neuroscience PhD at UT this fall.

I have a reasonable stipend with tuition covered. I have maybe 300-500$ leftover each month after accounting for the necessities (lodging, food, insurance, taxes).

As fellowships and grants for international students are few, what can I do to supplement my income by $500-$1k? Does TA-ing work? Are there bond-free/non-repayable fellowships that I can apply for?

Thanks!
