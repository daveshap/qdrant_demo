I realized I’m a boring ass person
Writing all these application essays and looking for anything interesting about me or things that have happened to me made me realize I am boring as hell. 

The things I like are shopping, music, art, reading, and exercise. Problem is I’m not avid enough about any of these. I’m not a black belt karate competitor or play a competitive sport or anything unique...all I do is go to the gym and run on my treadmill. I don’t listen to some obscure indie artist, play a bassoon, or am obsessed with classical music and famous composers...I just like pop music. 

I always thought I had a lot of personality but it feels impossible to get that through. On paper I’m as bland as an A4 sheet of paper.
