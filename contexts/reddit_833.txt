Does anyone feel depressed that their anxiety has kept them from experiencing major parts of a "normal" life?
I barely went out with friends when I was in high school. Always heard about my friends going out to parties, but I never went to one myself. In university, I avoided going out with friends, and mostly kept to myself. At the time, I didn't realize I had anxiety. But now, when I look back, knowing that I had anxiety and depression, it makes me really sad that I missed out on socializing and parties. Even though deep down I feel like I would have felt uncomfortable at them anyways. Not sure if that makes sense or not. It's sort of feeling like I wish I could have enjoyed them even though the reality is that I probably wouldn't have enjoyed them much even if I had had the opportunity to socialize more.
