ESCOBAR: No, he drowned a cousin of mine with about five hundred other people. But they weren't very important, just a bunch of dumb Mexicans living by a dam. Now beat it, Gittes, you don't come out of this smelling like a rose, you know.
GITTES: Oh yeah? Can you think of something to charge me with?
ESCOBAR: When I do, you'll hear about it.
MORTY: Jake, what're you doin' here?
GITTES: Nothin', Morty, it's my lunch hour, I thought I'd drop by and see who died lately.
MORTY: Yeah? Ain't that something? Middle of a drought, the water commissioner drowns. Only in L.A.
GITTES: Yeah. Banged up pretty bad.
MORTY: That's a long fall.
GITTES: So how are you, Morty?
