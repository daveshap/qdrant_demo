MIMI: That's ridiculous.
GUILD: Let him have his say out.
NICK: Morelli - You knew Julia. Was she gypping Wynant?
MORELLI: She don't say she is, but I figure she is -
NICK: Why do you say that?
MORELLI: Once I wanted five grand -- Cash -
NICK: Thank you. Now I'll tell you why I know Wynant didn't commit those murders - Three months ago - the night that he caught you in Julia's apartment, he found out that Julia was cheating him, and was splitting with some man. He went to find the man. That man was.... Tanner, don't you...?
NICK: I'm sorry. Tanner, don't you want some wine?
TANNER: No... no.
NORA: You're going to drive me crazy!
NICK: Let's see... where was I? Oh, yes. He went to find the man. That man was desperate! He knew that he was caught dead to rights -- and with prison staring him in the face, he took the only way out. He killed Wynant. It's terrible to tell you this way but your father's dead, Dorothy.
DOROTHY: Dead?
NICK: He's been dead for three months.
ANDY: Darling, don't cry. Please. I know it's terrible. But isn't it really better this way?
DOROTHY: Oh, Andy, Andy!
