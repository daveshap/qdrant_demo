JACOB: Hello.
PAUL: Jacob Singer?
JACOB: Speaking.
PAUL: Paul Gruneger!
JACOB: Paul Gruneger! Well I'll be goddamned!
JACOB: Paul! You son-of-a-bitch, how the hell are you? I haven't seen you in what, five, six, years?
PAUL: A long time.
JACOB: Jesus Christ. How've you been? What's happening in your life?
PAUL: Nothin' much.
JACOB: Me neither. Nothing too exciting. So tell me, to what do I owe the honor?
PAUL: I need to see you, Jake.
JACOB: Shit, Paul. I'd love to see you. But I'm kind of laid up here. I've been sick.
PAUL: I need to see you.
JACOB: Jesus, man, you look terrific. You must have put on twenty pounds.
PAUL: I work in a bakery.
JACOB: You're lucky. How many vets you know are even employed?
PAUL: Count 'em on one hand.
JACOB: It's almost like a conspiracy, huh?
PAUL: No joke. Fuckin' army! That goddamn war. I'm still fightin' it.
JACOB: It's not worth it. You'll never win.
PAUL: You tellin' me? How many times can you die, huh?
PAUL: Still married, Jake?
JACOB: Nope.
PAUL: You and everybody else. God I hate this area. Makes me nervous.
JACOB: Why the hell we drivin' here?
PAUL: I just need to talk.
JACOB: You can't talk in Brownsville?
PAUL: I'm not sure where I can talk anymore.
JACOB: What's wrong?
PAUL: Let's get a couple drinks, okay? Hey, take a look behind us. Do you think that car is followin' us?
JACOB: That black car?
PAUL: Pull the mirror down on the sun visor. Just watch 'em.
JACOB: What's goin' on Paul?
PAUL: I don't know.
JACOB: You in trouble?
PAUL: Yeah.
