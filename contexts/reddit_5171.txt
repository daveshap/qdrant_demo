How do I disclose an arrest that brought no charges and was dropped?
A month ago I was arrested with a third degree felony. I was never arraigned and eventually the case was disposed. While applying to jobs, how would I disclose to future recruiters/HR staff, my situation? 

I was employed by NASA before I was arrested and unfortunately my supervisor decided to terminate me before I could explain what happened (I was still on my year long probationary period). 

I have had some recruiters ask me why I left NASA and have been stumped as to how to word what I need to say.
