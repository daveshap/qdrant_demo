Advice for dealing w/ (Borderline) Belligerent Student?
Originally posted to wrong sub, so I deleted. Apologies if you've seen this already.

TL;DR Cocky kid without the skills to back it up tried to correct me, they were wrong, and it was a derail.

I'm a TA at an American R1 for context, and I had a student in a very low-level freshman level class take me on a two minute digression where they argued with me on a routine part of a calculation. Instructors make mistakes on blackboard calculations all the time, but in this case, they took issue with a well-established pratice. I explained that what they had in mind was unnecessary and told them not to worry about it for the moment (I was running out of class time). 

They were insistent that I wasn't approaching the problem correctly based on an aesthetic argument ("doesn't seem very scientific") and I assured them that this is how the field handles these things. They then proceeded to make a comment that I genuinely missed as I hauled the whole class back on track, but what little I caught of it was snide. Because I didn't catch it, I couldn't decide how to respond, so I ignored it (which may have been appropriate even if I knew what they said.)

In retrospect and in future, I'll ask them to prove their pet theories mathematically on paper for me and move on when I'm pressed for time (not in those exact words). I am wondering if anyone has other advice.
