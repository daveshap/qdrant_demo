How does resistance convert voltage to current? This is a statement that I read mainly on books about electronics. Could someone explain why after the resistance current is what makes things work and not voltage?Example from the Art of Electronics of Horowitz/Winfield:\" <blockquote>  Roughly speaking resistors are used to convert a voltage to a current  and vice versa.This may sound awfully trite</blockquote>Also it is a common practice when someone is working with solenoid proportional valves: A resistance is added before the solenoid so that it shall be controlled by current and not voltage because voltage will drop in case that temperature will rise.\"
