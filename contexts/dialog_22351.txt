MERCUTIO: Keep away the cats! Thou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword upon the table and says, &quot;God send me no need of thee.&quot; and by the operation of the second cup draws him on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.
BENVOLIO: Am I like Such a fellow?
MERCUTIO: Thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Verona.
BENVOLIO: By my head here come the Capulets.
MERCUTIO: By my heel, I care not.
TYBALT: Follow me close. Gentlemen, gooday. A word with one of you?
MERCUTIO: OH, and but one word with one of us? Couple it with something. Make it a word and a...a blow.
TYBALT: You shall find me apt enough to that, sir. And you will give me occasion.
MERCUTIO: Could you not take some occasion without giving?
TYBALT: Mercutio! Thou art consortest with Romeo?
MERCUTIO: Consort? What does thou make us minstrels? An thou make minstrels of us look to hear nothing of discords. Here's my fiddlestick. Here's that shall make you dance! Zounds, Consort!
BENVOLIO: Either withdraw unto some private place, or reason coldly of your grievences, or else depart. Here all eyes gaze on us.
MERCUTIO: Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze. I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.
