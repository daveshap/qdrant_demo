Dual boot /w Win, want to change my Xubuntu to Ubuntu Dual boot /w Win, want to change my Xubuntu to Ubuntu.What would be the most convenient way to do that? I want the system to be as bloat-free as possible, so I went as far as thinking about formatting Xubuntu completely just to install Ubuntu from scratch.Also, how would I do that without destroying my Win partitions, and keeping the Grub intact?Edit:And what if all I'm doing is changing the DE, does purging xfce4 really removes everything that is unnecessary?
