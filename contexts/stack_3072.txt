Time for a photon to pass through a massive body Suppose there is a neutron star with a hole in the middle.  Through this hole, scientists shoot a laser beam in such a way that it will pass through the gravity well of the neutron star but will not be bent by it.I imagine that when photons are going in the hole, they blueshift, but after leaving they redshift (due to curved spacetime?).  But how about the time they take from one side to the other? Will it be the same as if the neutron star wasn't there? If not, how do I calculate it?
