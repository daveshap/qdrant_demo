VAL: So what if we just did it...today. Pack up. Drive straight down to Bixby. Get serious.
EARL: We could. We could. But we'd have to get <u>really</u> serious. It's gonna cost twice as much to rent a place.
VAL: So? That car wash pays good, and they're always looking.
EARL: Car wash?! That's got no future. If we're gonna take the plunge we oughta have a better plan than that.
VAL: Yeah, sure. Go ahead and plan it...for a year or two.
