Laboratory tips?
I just started in a new lab and was wondering if anyone had any tips or tricks they've learned. Like storing supplies effectively, cleaning, staying on task, working with other grad students, documentation etc.

The lab I've joined is focused on membrane separation of blood. Lots of tubing, old parts, and such.
