Maybe there really isn’t someone out there for everyone.
[29F] here that has never had a boyfriend, and frankly have never even come close to being in a relationship. I tried online dating, I tried meeting people in person, I tried delving into hobbies, but nothing has come  of it, and I’m cripplingly lonely.
 
I had some progress earlier this year when I finally lost my virginity, but the guy I gave it to, told me I was special, but his life was too chaotic at the moment and he wasn’t ready for a relationship. So naturally, I took that as “I want to be in a relationship, I just don’t want to be in one with you.”

At this point it’s getting embarrassing because my parents are now stating that I should let them pick someone for me. And I even decided to delete all of my social medias because I couldn’t stand seeing all those around me getting into relationships, getting serious with someone, or getting engaged/married. Meanwhile, I’m still here, watching from the sidelines and panicking because surely everyone is laughing at me for being single for the past thirteen years.

Do you ever hate hearing “you’ll find someone.” ? Because frankly, I honestly don’t think that there is someone for everyone out there. Dating and constant rejection has made me numb. And the fact that I’m basically 30, and still haven’t found someone to love me, or even try to get to know me, brings me to tears. I’m tired, I’m feeling hopeless, and I’m trying my hardest to accept that some people are meant to get through their lives alone.

End rant.
