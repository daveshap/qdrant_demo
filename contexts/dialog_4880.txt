JANE: Give it to him -- so we can concentrate.
TOM: Ah, I don't want any credit. Bobbie and I serve anonymously.
BOBBIE: You know, I like Tom, because hi...
JANE: Bobbie, please.
BUDDY: ...and the White House is hoping to keep a lid on it for a few days till they figure out what to do.
TOM: Thanks a lot, Buddy.
BUDDY: Oh, please. So they were really impressed with you at work.
TOM: Not impressed exactly -- but a break in the clouds.
BUDDY: I see the change in you -- I see it.
TOM: So he bought this Peugeot sedan at a greatly reduced price while he was there in charge of the White House Advance Team.
JENNIFER: How come you're not chasing it down yourself?
TOM: Look, I'm junior man -- and it's your beat.
JENNIFER: Boy, that's nice...I wish we could all deal with each other like this. I'll check it. Anything I can do for you?
TOM: This is my first time at the White House. Is there any chance to look at where he works and the rest of it?
JENNIFER: I didn't have the guts to ask when I first came up. I'll get you a great tour.
