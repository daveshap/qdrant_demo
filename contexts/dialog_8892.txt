JACK: What are you, crazy?
FRANK: I just thought we should talk about it. Between ourselves.
JACK: What's there to talk about? She can sing. That puts her at the head of the class. That makes her the only one in the class.
FRANK: I don't know ... She had gum on her lip, for Christ sake. I don't think she's right for the act.
JACK: You're getting cold feet about this.
FRANK: I was just thinking what Ma would think.
JACK: Ma? Ma? Was Ma there the last time we played the Ambassador? Oh, that's right, she was on bass. How could I forget.
JACK: How many other silent partners are there, Frank? Donna? Little Cindy? Hell, let's give Eddie a vote.
FRANK: Okay, okay. I'll call the girl.
JACK: What's the matter?
FRANK: I didn't get her number.
