Is there anyone who started dating in their 20s? What was it like?
I'm 23 [F] and I've never been on a date or in a relationship. I don't even know how to be friends with a guy. 

I don't know where it's coming from, but I feel this pressure to date and find someone because I feel like I'm falling behind everyone else. I know if I was going to be in a relationship, I only want something serious because I'm not really interested in hookups. 

I downloaded Okcupid and Hinge, but I'm not  matching with anyone because at the back of my mind, I know that's not how I'd like to meet people. However, it's my only option at the moment because I'm not very social. I've been thinking about just going on dates as a way to become more familiar around men and then maybe going out more.

Edit: I'm trying my best to read and respond to every comment. I really appreciate all of your answers and I'm glad to know that I'm not alone.
