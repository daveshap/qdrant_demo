Word meaning \"reduce chances of occurrence\"? In the aftermath of a significant problem I'm trying to express that the necessary steps have been taken to reduce the chances of it happening again. I can't guarantee it won't happen again, otherwise \"prevent\" would be perfect. The only other word I've been able to come up with is \"mitigate\" which incorrectly conveys that the effect of the next disaster will be diminished, not that it's less likely to happen at all.\"We've taken measures to ______ another disaster.\"I'd prefer a single word, but a phrase is okay as long as it sounds less awkward than \"We've taken measures to reduce the chances of another disaster occurring.\"
