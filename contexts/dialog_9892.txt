BARNES: Frances? Oh no.
FRANCES: Refill my drink, will you, Bob?
BARNES: What're you doing?
FRANCES: Putting on my armor.
BARNES: Come on, Frances. Louella Parsons is here. She wants to talk to you, help you out.
FRANCES: Louella... didn't she call me a spoiled little bitch?
BARNES: Come on, she's an important columnist! What's the matter? I thought you wanted these people to forgive you.
FRANCES: 'Forgive'...? For What?
BARNES: I'm sorry... that was an unfortunate choice of words.
