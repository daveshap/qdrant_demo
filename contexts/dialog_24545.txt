JERRY: You going to call the police?
JOE: The police? We'd never live to testify. Not against Spats Colombo. Wabash 1098.
JERRY: We got to get out of town. Maybe we ought to grow beards.
JOE: We are going out of town. But we're going to shave.
JERRY: Shave? At a time like this? Those guys got machine guns - they're going to blast our heads off - and you want to shave?
JOE: Shave our legs, stupid.
