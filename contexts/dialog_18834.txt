PHIL: Oh yes, oh that's great.
HARRY: I'm very nervous.
PHIL: Why?
HARRY: The last date I had was twenty years ago.
PHIL: That's true. Harry Harry sit down, let me fill you in on today's women, since the last time you dated, something happened, &quot;The Sexual Revolution&quot;, now before that, you used to have to hold a door open for a woman, pull her chair out, pick up the check, no more no more, you wanna know what else is missing? BRAS!
HARRY: Oh come on.
PHIL: Harry, I'm serious, trust me Harry this woman's lifting us in, you gotta treat her like every Tom Dick and Harry.
HARRY: Are you sure about all this?
PHIL: Did you not tell Vada I'm a womanizer huh?
HARRY: Oh, I'm running late. Shelly'll be here any minute.
PHIL: Oh she's picking you up, good you're on the right track.
HARRY: No, she's just driving over here, then we're taking my car. How do I look?
PHIL: Like a Sultenfuss. Go get 'em.
HARRY: Goodnight Vada.
VADA: Dad, why are you dressed up to go to bingo?
HARRY: Ahh, I just wanna look nice.
VADA: You never cared before.
HARRY: Well Shelly's coming over, we're gonna go together.
VADA: Why?
HARRY: She likes to play bingo.
VADA: Can I go too?
HARRY: Naah, I think you'd better stay here and keep Grammoo company.
