LLOYD: Margo - and Bill - want us to meet them at the Cub Room tonight, after theater. For a bottle of wine.
KAREN: Margo in the Cub Room. I couldn't be more surprised if she'd said Grant's Tomb.
LLOYD: I'm glad Bill's back.
KAREN: They'd die without each other.
LLOYD: Darling, I didn't promise Eve anything. Just said I thought she'd be fine for the part, but there were some practical difficulties...
KAREN: Such as?
LLOYD: You - for one. I told her you were set on Margo playing the part - and I certainly wouldn't make a change without your approval.
