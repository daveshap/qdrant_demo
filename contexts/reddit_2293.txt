Can I submit my application without my teacher of recommendation letters (will send later) and transcripts (will also send later)?
Just unsure. My mom wants to submit my applications today but we aren’t sure if I can without my counselor’s and teachers’ letter of recommendations and only requested (not sent yet) transcripts
