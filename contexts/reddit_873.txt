The side of anxiety most people don’t understand.
Started a new job about a month ago, finally received my embroidered shirts that I’m required to wear. Go to put one on and it doesn’t fit, none of them do. Now I’m having to wear the plain t-shirt into work until they can order me more. I woke up 2 1/2 hours early to make sure I was ready. Now I’m sitting in a parking lot nearby being so nervous to have to tell my boss they don’t fit. Anxiety is having to go through every scenario possible that can happen when I go back in. My body hurts physically and I feel nauseous over this. All over a simple fix that will take him 5 seconds to handle in reality, but my brain doesn’t work that way. This sucks ☹️
