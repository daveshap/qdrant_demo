Who's ready for a career advice AMA?
Hey Reddit. I’m Ross Wehner, Founder of WehnerEd Career Consulting, and I’m here to share about topics related to careers and professional development starting at 6pm EDT. I’ve coached dozens of people and helped them seamlessly transition from dull jobs to fulfilling careers and to unlock their potential to achieve more personally and professionally. Now it's time for me to help you too :)

NONE of the advice I plan to share is for affiliate reasons and I won’t get a cut of any revenue, proceeds, gifts, etc. stemming from the advice I share today from outside of WehnerEd. Everything I share today is with the best intentions for your career success. 

I apologize in advance for any spelling or grammar mistakes I make. It’s just me over here answering these questions (proof! [https://imgur.com/73IXO1y](https://imgur.com/73IXO1y)) and I’m ignoring my typical attention to detail for the sake of responding as quickly and thoughtfully as I can. Also, for some reason the Grammarly Chrome plugin doesn’t seem to work on Reddit's editor... only on markdown.

Finally, please try to keep your questions from getting too specific for your particular situation so this discussion can be helpful to everyone. 

Thanks!

**Edit (10:04 pm Tuesday)**:  Thank you all for the great questions! I'm writing lengthier responses than I originally planned so it is taking me longer to get through the posts. I plan on answering everyone but it might take me a bit to get to your question. Thanks for your understanding and keep 'em coming!

**Update (12:03 am Tuesday)**: Thank you everyone who participated tonight!! I'm happy with the diverse array of questions that were asked and know that our conversation will help many others who will visit the archive as well. I have answered each of the questions so far and am signing off for the night. I'll revisit the post tomorrow and will answer a few more based on upvotes. Please feel free to DM me if other questions pop up.
