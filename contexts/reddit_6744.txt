Is getting texted by recruiters a thing now?
I have been actively job searching for 3 years now. Plenty of resume (and updates), few interviews, a metric ton of rejections, my share of ghosting/ no call back.  

My question is that I have been getting a lot of recruiters that text me. I don't think that this is very professional because I reserve texting to people that I have met or know in some way. I would love input from everyone else.  What do you think of staffing companies that have people text you for jobs or opportunities ?
