Do the filings made this past week by Mueller's office offer any definitive language that the president is involved in legal wrongdoing?
This past week saw several filings by of the Office of Special Counsel in relation to Trump's former  [National Security](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/04/us/politics/michael-flynn-special-counsel-sentencing-memo.html) Advisor, [personal lawyer](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/07/nyregion/michael-cohen-sentence.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage), and [campaign chairman](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/07/us/politics/manafort-special-counsel-lies.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage). 

After the last filing was made public, Donald Trump Tweeted: 
>["Totally clears the President. Thank you!"](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1071177621445230596)

Is this accurate, or do any of these filings offer definitive evidence that the president is involved in legal wrongdoing?
