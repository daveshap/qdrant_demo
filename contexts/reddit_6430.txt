About to work for Amazon, what can I expect?
So, as the title says, I'm about to start working at Amazon. Specifically in the warehouse department. I've read a few horror stories about them treating employees badly with micromanagement, sick people during this pandemic coming to work, etc. But is it really THAT bad? Should I rethink my decision of working for them? I want to work for them for at least a year to get some experience, but these horror stories are kind of scaring me away.

Edit: You know what, I'm going to give it a try anyway despite the horror stories. I'll see what it's like for myself.
