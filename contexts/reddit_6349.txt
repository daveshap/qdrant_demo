I am a Compensation Analyst for a large, international company. AMAA!
Hello!  I am a Compensation Analyst for a company based in the U.S. that has business units and offices in 26 different countries.  I wanted to do an AMA to answer questions you might have coming from a slightly different perspective than a recruiter has.  My job focuses on salary information for positions to include researching our current salaries and comparing them to market data to ensure equity, and also in job description creation.  

I can try to help out the best I can with job questions, resumes, or other compensation related inquiries.  

AM(Almost)A!

Edit:  I will be heading home soon, and will try to answer any more questions tonight and over the weekend, I hope that you all found this helpful.
