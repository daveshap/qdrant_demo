Any details on Dannie Plachta's bio and name pronunciation? I've discovered an interesting sci-fi author named Dannie Plachta (read a couple of his short stories, Alien Artifact and Revival Meeting, by pure chance and found them rather charming). I would read more of his writings if I could just find them. But the information on him is so scarce, not even a Wikipedia page. Does anyone have any details on his bio?I thought it to be a Polish family name first (like Zelazny, for example), but a couple of dubious sources mention that his real name was Daniel Plettey (???), so I'm not sure any more. Has anyone perchance happened to hear his name spoken aloud by someone knowledgeable?
