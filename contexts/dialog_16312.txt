LOGAN: I don't know who you are. I'd like to thank someone.
VOICE: It doesn't matter who we are. Follow the tunnel to the end.
LOGAN: Will there be someone to tell us where to go from there...?
VOICE: Someone will follow. When you come to the lock, he will tell you how to go on the other side. Jessica may go with you as far as the lock.
LOGAN: No. Jessica goes back now. Take her back. Now! Go on back. Back outside, Jessica.
