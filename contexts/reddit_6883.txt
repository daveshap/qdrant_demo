Going to be put on a second PIP - advice on next steps!
I've worked at my company for about a year, but my boss recently had a formal conversation about my subpar performance. They laid out what needs improvement and performance review is in 2 months. It honestly sounds like I'm on the path to being put on a PIP. I'm pretty sure they've started documenting my mistakes, which is making me extremely nervous. I have taken steps to show some signs of improvement, but I don't know if it's enough.

I was put on a PIP at my last company with some overlapping areas of concern. It was not a good experience, and I certainly do not want to go through the same thing at this company.

While I genuinely believe my current boss is trying to help me improve, it's hard to not feel incompetent knowing this is the second time. My previous and current job required a similar skill set but are not the same. Should I start looking for another job or seek other types of jobs? Am I not cut out for my job?
