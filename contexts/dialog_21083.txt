SMYTHE: Well done, sir. Very neat.
STEW: That's what I think of it, Bingy!
STEW: Smythe, the - er - gentleman is leaving.
SMYTHE: Yes, sir.
ANNE: Good morning, Mother. Didn't I tell you that he'd be marvelous. Everybody thought he was so charming last night.
MRS. SCHUYLER: I was so worried for fear he'd knock over a vase or something. I must have acted like an idiot. What does it say about the reception last night?
ANNE: Oh, the usual thing. Blah, blah, blah attended the blah, blah reception and wore the same blah, blah things.
MRS. SCHUYLER: Stop it. Anne. You're behaving like the person you're married to.
ANNE: You don't have anything to complain about, Mother. He was all right last night, wasn't he? I told you not to worry about him.
MRS. SCHUYLER: It was a miracle. The man was ill or something.
MRS. SCHUYLER: Ah-ah-ah!
ANNE: Mother!
MRS. SCHUYLER: Look! Look! The front page!
