What is the science "not available decades ago" behind the Georgia heartbeat bill?
I've tried posting this to several subreddits, and got no reply, so let's try this one:

The text of the Georgia heartbeat bill mentions that: "modern medical science, not available decades ago, demonstrates that unborn children are a class of living, distinct persons..." Can anyone explain what is the scientific discovery that they're talking about?
