SUSAN: You're touchy, Sidney - don't be so touchy...
SIDNEY: I wasn't looking for a brawl. I came to bring him a present. Wanna bite to eat?
SIDNEY: Feels like a Monday night, don't it...?
SUSAN: Not to me. Sometimes, the world feels like a cage. Then someone comes along and opens the door...and it's never Monday night again... I wish you and Steve could like each other.
SIDNEY: We stick in each others craw.
SUSAN: Yes, but why?
SIDNEY: Well, for one thing, he thinks J.J. is some kind of monster.
