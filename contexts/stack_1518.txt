GPS L5C Differential? Max Update Rate(bits/s|Hz)? The differential GPS chips use L1 and L2C to calculate the ionospheric interference. With the new GPS satellites, the new band L5C is being deployed, and I am wondering about the following things:Will L1 and L5C be used as new type of differential ionospheric error correction? Could L1 use both L2C and L5C as a kind of double correction at the same time? (Would it even be necessary or make sense, or are they still testing this and I\u2019m getting ahead of myself)Separately, could L1/L5 produce superior differentiation to L1/L2?I\u2019ve been reading documentation and cannot seem to grasp what the new nav data rate for L5C signal is (per each SV). Is it still the same 50Hz of L1 and L2, or is it 25Hz, or is it 100Hz? Whats throwing me off is the following line: \u201cThe 50 bit/s data is coded in a rate 1/2 convolution coder\u201dWhat update rate do the SBAS SV\u2019s transmit? Is it also 50Hz?
