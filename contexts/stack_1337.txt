Why would a light fixture be incompatible with dimmer switches? I'm considering buying the Aero Pure AP80-RVL, which is a recessed bathroom light/exhaust fan combo. It's important to me to be able to use a dimmer switch for the light, but the installation instructions for this unit specifically say not to use one.<blockquote>  Use an on/off switch to operate this fan. See \u201cConnect Wiring\u201d for details.  The humidity control and fan can be operated separately. Can be used with a dual \u201cstacked\u201d switch for fan / light control. Do not use  a dimmer switch to operate the humidity control or light.</blockquote>I checked the \"Connect Wiring\" section for further detail, as mentioned in the quote above, but there is no further information about dimmer switches. Doing a text search on the rest of the installation manual yields no further references to dimmer switches either.I understand why you can't install a dimmer switch for the fan/humidity control, but for light fixtures I always assumed it was just the bulb and whether or not the dimmer switch was compatible with the bulb (in the case of an LED bulb) that determined if you could install a dimmer switch. This leads me to the following two questions: Why would a light fixture itself not be compatible with a dimmer switch or why would a manufacturer say not to use a dimmer? Would I run any risks such as damaging the unit, causing a fire, etc. if I went against the installation instructions and put a dimmer on the light anyway?
