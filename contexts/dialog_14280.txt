JACKIE: You tell those guys they'll have to do one helluva lot better than that before I'll even say 'hi' to them.
PUBLIC DEFENDER: Well, that's the State's offer. If you plead to possession and tell L.A.P.D. what they want to know, your bond will be set at one-thousand dollars. If you don't, L.A.P.D. will request one at twenty-five thousand based on your prior record and risk of flight. If you don't post it or don't know anyone who can, you'll spend six to eight weeks in County before your arraignment comes up.
JACKIE: Who's side are you on?
PUBLIC DEFENDER: I beg your pardon?
JACKIE: What if I plead guilty?
PUBLIC DEFENDER: And cooperate? You might get probation.
JACKIE: If I don't cooperate?
PUBLIC DEFENDER: With the prior? You could get anywhere from a year to five depending on the judge. You want to think about it? You got two minutes before we're up.
