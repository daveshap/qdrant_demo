PAPPAS: You through, Mr. Wizard? Let me know if you find Jimmy Hoffa under the seat while you're at it. Hell, it's only 7:30. The night's still young... you can solve this case and start on another one.
UTAH: Well, what're your ideas on these guys?
PAPPAS: Forget about it, kid. They're ghosts. Let the goddamn yuppie Mormon affirmative action assholes handle it. See I'm almost 55... so I must be senile, right? They better get me out before I start pissing myself in public. Drooling. It would look bad for the Bureau, right?
UTAH: So you're gonna coast to retirement, when you could nail these guys and go out with come dignity.
PAPPAS: You watch your fucking mouth! Mr. Hoover himself pinned the Seal of Honor right here!
UTAH: Sorry.
PAPPAS: Yeah. That was thirty years ago anyway. L.A.'s changed a lot since then. The air got dirty and the sex got clean. So you want to nail the Ex- Presidents? Be a big hero?
UTAH: Yeah. What's your theory?
PAPPAS: The fucking punks are surfers.
