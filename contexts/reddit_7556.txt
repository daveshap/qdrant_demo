Thank you r/GradSchool, also a question
Hi all! I have made a few posts on here and wanted to thank you all for your great advice. I did finally finish and submit my thesis this past Friday. Now I am preparing my defense presentation, but I had a question. Do I just present the same info on my paper? I feel like committee is going to be extremely bored if I just present the same information. Also, what the heck makes a good defense?
