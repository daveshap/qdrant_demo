Is it customary to send thank you emails after an open house
Just attended and open house (already committed to the school) and I was wondering if I should send out thank you emails? I already accepted, they know I accepted, and we are both aware that I will be seeing them in the fall (I also had meetings with them and thanked them there as well). So, do I still send thank you emails?
