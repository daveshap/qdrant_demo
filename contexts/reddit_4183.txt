Being honest about your feelings can get you two very different reactions.
So, I've had a lot going on in the past 2 months.  I was casually seeing two different women when I realized I:

A) felt nothing akin to romantic feelings developing.  I was never super excited to spend time with them.  I enjoyed it, but I wasn't super sexually attracted to them.

B) Still had feelings for the last person I was with (over 6 months ago).

I felt this was unfair to both of them and told both of them (separate texts) that I wasn't feeling it and that I was sorry but I had some unresolved issues to work on, etc.  I explained as politely as I could and was upfront after about a month/month and a half of dating them.  It's always tough to break bad news to people, especially because you feel guilty.

Girl A: Flipped her shit, cursed me out, and told me to lose her number.  I had told her from the get go that I was emotionally unavailable but she apparently thought it was different than I said.  I don't blame her for feeling like a stepping stone, but better to tell her now.

Girl B: Totally understood and she was just finishing her divorce papers and we parted on friendly terms and are cool enough to be friends.  Similar interests, views, etc.  She was thankful to me and said that she was in a similar place as well and things were casual.  



(Probably preaching to the choir here).

We talk a lot on this sub about being forthright and honest with others, but the thing is, sometimes, we're afraid of how others will react.  Just be honest with people.  It's hard, but it's worth it to treat them like the adult they are.

E: I did tell them as soon as I realized I was emotionally unavailable. I took a couple days to really process and look inward to make sure it was that and I was telling them them my truth.
