RAY: Biscuit, when you're done with Jangle Leg, you think you could squeeze me in?
BISCUIT: Thought you'd never ask. Biscuit needs some gravy.
RAY: I'm talking about a haircut.
BISCUIT: Cost you a pair of nylons.
POKER FACE: Hey, Ray, Goldmouth don't believe me. Ain't it so they got trains up in New York City that run under the streets?
RAY: They're called subways. A nickel will take you from one end of Manhattan to the other. Helluva ride, too.
RADIO: Hey, Ray, you ever been to the Cotton Club?
RAY: Sure I've been to the Cotton Club. It's pretty sweet. But it don't hold a candle to the Boom Boom Room. That's where the real action is.
WILLIE: What's the Boom Boom Room?
RAY: That's my joint. The swinginest nightclub in town.
COOKIE: You got your own nightclub?
RAY: Well, not yet. It's still in the planning stages.
GOLDMOUTH: So it don't exist.
RAY: Just because it's in my mind, Goldmouth, don't mean it ain't real. Everything worth anything starts with a dream.
