My best friend of 10 years said she won’t care if I kill myself
We were in a normal discussion and somehow my suicidal side was brought up. She said she won’t stop me if I kill myself and she doesn’t really care.....and people are responsible for their life, so she it won’t bother if I kill myself.

Wow.... best friend eh?

I’ve always thought at least someone will care if I die.... I guess not :(
