Nervous for my new role
I’ve just graduated from university and landed a good permanent job. My first day is tomorrow and I’m really nervous about it, I’m always worried that I may not be up to the task or my prospective colleagues would dislike me. I don’t feel so confident though I feel like it’s just going to pass. Any advice on how I can make a good first impression and learn quickly?
