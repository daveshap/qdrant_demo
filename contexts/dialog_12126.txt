ADAM: It's funny, when I first met you I thought you were such a weirdo...I still think you're a nut, but you're my nut.
PIXEL: Yeah...Are we going to do it or what? I still haven't packed.
ADAM: Why are you being so grouchy--This is an important night for us...
PIXEL: Adam. Dollface. We had a physical relationship that served a purpose and now...
ADAM: But, but that was before we started sharing stuff. Before I told you how I cried when Peepers died. I never told anyone that before.
PIXEL: And this Peepers was your...dog? If it makes you feel better, I probably wasn't paying attention.
ADAM: That doesn't make me feel better! Why are you being like this?
PIXEL: Don't raise your voice at--I gave you the ultimate male fantasy--sex, nothing on the side. Don't pretend we shared anything other than fluids.
ADAM: Stop it, stop it, you satanic whore!
