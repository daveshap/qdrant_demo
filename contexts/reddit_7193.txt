How do you know you are ready to take on more responsibilities?
My manager told me that my fear of taking on more (or new) responsibilities and lack of confidence in making decisions is holding me back from moving up the career ladder. He told me that if I can get past these, moving up should be no problem. 

I realised that it's true. My fear of failure gives me anxiety and lowers my confidence level to do new things, or make decisions for fear that they are the wrong ones. When I do new things, I have so nervous that I sit on it for a long time.

How do you overcome that?
