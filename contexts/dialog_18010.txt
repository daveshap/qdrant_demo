SINDELL: I'm a literary agent, and I feel like a fool calling you, but I think one of my clients, Paul Sheldon, might be in some kind of trouble.
BUSTER: Paul Sheldon? You mean Paul Sheldon the writer?
SINDELL: Yes.
BUSTER: He's your client, huh?
SINDELL: Yes, he is.
BUSTER: People sure like those Misery books.
SINDELL: I'm sure you know Paul's been going to the Silver Creek Lodge for years to finish his books.
BUSTER: Yeah, I understand he's been up here the last six weeks.
SINDELL: Not quite. I just called, and they said he checked out five days ago. Isn't that a little strange?
BUSTER: I don't know. Does he always phone you when he checks out of hotels?
SINDELL: No, no, of course not. It's just that his daughter hasn't heard from him, and when he's got a book coming out, he usually keeps in touch. So when there was no word from him...
BUSTER: You think he might be missing?
SINDELL: I hate that I made this call--tell me I'm being silly.
