KLINGER: We still gotta run the drill before we walk in that lobby.
THEO: Go ahead then. I'm covering the receiver. She can't hear.
KLINGER: First off, this Mr. Chow Yen doesn't speak a lot of English. The girl with him will interpret. There will be a third person to accompany you into the men's room where you can take count. I hope you know Krugerands better than they know a <u>Hockney</u>.
THEO: I improved on the fucking original.
KLINGER: Let's hope so. Once you come out and okay everything I'll give Caitlin the sign that she can bring the painting on over.
THEO: It's rolled up in the tube on the floor back there.
LENORE: Why isn't anyone answering me?
THEO: Just hang on. I've got a life of my own.
CAITLIN: What if they do question the authenticity?
KLINGER: Oh. Seems yours girlfriend is casting doubts on your expertise.
CAITLIN: I am not! Fuck you! Theo's a genius.
KLINGER: Any trouble, we whip out our Treasury Department badges -- show them the wire I'm wearing and read them their rights. Theo seizes the Krugerands as evidence. Naturally they start negotiating. Offer to give us up somebody else. And we listen. Take notes on who bought what stolen art and tell them we have to clear it with our superiors at Justice. We pick up their passports -- escort them to their room and leave them all in the bathroom handcuffed to the plumbing.
LENORE: Will you please speak to me! Theo?
THEO: Another minute.
KLINGER: Got your badge?
THEO: Satisfied, Wiseass?
KLINGER: In any event, whatever occurs you do not belt anybody.
THEO: What do you keep making me out to be?
THEO: Okay, okay, Lenore, calm down. Either let me call the school or better yet, the F.B.I.
KLINGER: Sure -- and they record your voice. And later on we all get slammed for kidnap and murder. That's out!
