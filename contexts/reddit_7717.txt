opinion on Fellowship programs after graduating with a Masters?
About to enter my final year of my Masters in Public Health for Health Management and Policy. I have no idea what my next step might look like but i’ve been interested in applying for fellowships within my field, but in particular health policy. Right now, I’m interning with a House Representative in my state and I am working on Health Financing bills. 

I have no idea what I want to do, so I thought a fellowship might be useful? Does anyone know the pros and cons of a fellowship? Any insight? 


thanks!
