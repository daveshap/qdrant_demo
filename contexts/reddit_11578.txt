My sexual frustration and lack of love life
I'm a moralistic virgin that wants to wait for her first relationship to have sex.


I always get ghosted after dates. Both on dating apps and IRL.

I'm 23, speak 3 languages , lived in 3 countries, have a degree, a good job and side projects that I enjoy and love.

I usually go two years or more without being asked out, caressed or kissed. 

I have tried all dating apps and putting myself out there IRL and even asked men out myself.

The sexual frustration is terrible, orgasms are terrible and I feel unloved and unwanted.

I have gave Reddit a go at least 6 times, to at least try and find an online relationship. With the person I talk to ghosting after max 5 days.

The idea of paying someone to at least kiss me and touch me has crossed my mind. My sexual frustration is so bad it actually turns into physical pain.

Sometimes I try and imagine I'm in the arms of a singer I fancy or something bring me some sort of comfort.

I'm a fucking joke a woman.
