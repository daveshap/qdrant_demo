Does anyone else get anxious when thinking about time wasting?
I feel like I'm rushing the day and wasting my own time as we don't have all day and it ends up getting me upset and anxious that I've wasted time it's like I've got to plan something at a certain time so can make the most out of my day but it's making me anxious about time
