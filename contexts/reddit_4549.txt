Can I still win at life?
I'm 24f and am just so sad about what my life has become. I just got out of a 2 1/2 year relationship and still havent finished my degree. I just feel so low and worthless...like I'll never be happy or fulfilled. I have no friends no job and no hobbies. Just really tired of life.
