ERICA: You got everything right but the car. My dad didn't get me a BMW.
TIM: What'd he get you?
ERICA: A Porsche.
TIM: Mm.
ERICA: Yeah. So, what about you?
TIM: What about me? I don't have a car.
ERICA: You just seem to know all these things about me and I don't know anything about you, you know. What kind of music do you like?
TIM: Military marching bands.
ERICA: You think I'm rich and you hate me.
TIM: Now, how the hell would you know what I think? Hm? You don't know me.
ERICA: I'd like to.
TIM: Oh, yeah?
ERICA: Mm-mm.
TIM: You know, it was the biggest mistake of my life.
ERICA: Really?
TIM: Well, I mean, you have to understand I was just this dopey kid mopping floors and kissing officer ass. I mean, well, I enlisted right out of high school. So I just wanted something different in my life.
ERICA: Mm.
TIM: It's not a job
ERICA: You cut off your little finger?
TIM: Well, they, uh they were nice enough to sew it back on.
ERICA: Let's see.
