BIALYSTOCK: Here, don't panic.
BLOOM: I'm sorry ... I don't like people touching my blue blanket. It's not important. It's a minor compulsion. I can deal with it if I want to. It's just that I've had it ever since I was a baby and ... and ... I find it very comforting.
BIALYSTOCK: They come here. They all come here. How do they find me?
BLOOM: Mr. Bialystock ...
BIALYSTOCK: Yes, Prince Mishkin, what can we do for you?
BLOOM: This is hardly a time for levity. I've discovered a serious error here in the accounts of your last play.
BIALYSTOCK: Where? What?
BLOOM: According to the backer's list you raised $60,000. But the show you produced only cost fifty-eight thousand. There's two thousand dollars unaccounted for.
BIALYSTOCK: I went to a Turkish bath, who cares? The show was a flop. What difference does it make?
BLOOM: It makes a great deal of difference. That's fraud. If they found out, you could go to prison.
BIALYSTOCK: Why should they find out? It's only two thousand dollars, Bloom, do me a favor, move a few decimal points around. You can do it. You're an accountant. The word 'count' is part of your title.
BLOOM: But that's cheating!
BIALYSTOCK: It's not cheating ... It's charity. Bloom, look at me ... look at me! I'm drowning. Other men sail through life. Bialystock has struck a reef. Bloom, I'm going under. I am being sunk by a society that demands success, when all I can offer is failure. Bloom, I'm reaching out to you. Don't send me to jail. Help! Help!
