Chronic liar won't shut up.... How to deal with her? 
A girl that I know (and can never avoid because she is clingy) is constantly making lies about herself to maker herself seem "cool" and attempts to degrade everyone by showing off how supposedly smart she is. Everyone I know who knows her are aware of the lies that she puts up, but she seems to be unaware that everyone sees through her. 

An example: she says she received 2220 on the December 2011 SAT, but when she was calculating on my laptop her most recent SAT score (I just looked up sat.collegeboard.com to see my scores, I calculated mine, and she asked if she could go on hers to see her score) , I saw her scores and watched her add up to a 1450, painfully low compared to her brilliant "2220" score. 

Another example: She told everyone that her parents are getting her either a new BMW, or a new Lexus (when both of her parents are nail salon artists, and clearly will *not* get her a brand new car.) She doesn't even have her permit (she told me herself). 

I don't have high tolerance for her and her lies anymore, and I'm resisting calling her out (as much as I freaking want to.) How do you deal with people who are constantly clingy, lying, and condescending? I have her in one class, and the only friends she has are my friends (she knows I don't like her, so she doesn't talk to me as much. But when she does talk to me, she tries to flatter me to get to my good side which is purely restricted to her.) I'm being civil, and I'm only coldly civil to her when she tells her lies constantly, over and over again. 

**TL;DR** - I don't have high tolerance for a girl who never stops to keep making up lies about herself to make herself "cool" and outrageously smart. How can I deal with her? I can't seem to completely avoid her. How do I get her to stop, or resist being mean to her?
