ANDREW: What's the matter, darling ... not sweet enough?
DOROTHY: It's all right.
ANDREW: Darling, your father's all right. He'll turn up in time.
DOROTHY: But tonight is Christmas Eve!
ANDREW: He's just forgotten. You know he forgets everything.
DOROTHY: He's never forgotten a promise to me. I'm worried about him. I know something's happened to him.
ANDREW: What could happen to him, darling? You mustn't worry.... What is it?
DOROTHY: Just a minute...
NICK: Another Martini --
DOROTHY: Hello, there!
