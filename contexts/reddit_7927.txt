HIGHLY interested in moving to Germany for Grad School. Any advice?
I am in the initial stages of my research and am narrowing down my options. But I am pretty confident that I will pursue psychology/counseling. 

I am an American citizen living on the east coast and have my bachelorâ€™s in criminal justice. 

If anyone has made a similar move, what advice do you have for me? 

Any and all advice is appreciated. 
Thank you all
