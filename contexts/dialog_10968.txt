PROXIMO: It will be good luck for you to wear that helmet... It belonged to Cimon of Smyrna... he was crushed by an elephant.
NARCISSUS: Lucky it didn't step on his head.
COS: So tell me, what happened between you and the emperor? What really happened on the German front? You know the Senate's arguing your case...
NARCISSUS: That's their job, isn't it? To argue. So, I think my case will be long on talk and short on action.
COS: I am prepared to write anything you tell me.
NARCISSUS: My birth sign is Water Bearer, twenty-fifth day in the month of Janus.
COS: The exact month when the Emperor must be confirmed!
NARCISSUS: The Emperor and I are bound by the threads of The Fates. He was born on August thirty-first, you know.
COS: That makes his birth sign... Virgo! Why that's the sign of a little girl! Can you tell my readers more about your star-crossed connection with Emperor Commodus?
NARCISSUS: Proximo, we need to talk about my one third... I imagine the betting booths will be doing good business. And, what was the name of that olive oil company?
