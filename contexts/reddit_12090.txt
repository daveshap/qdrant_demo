Secretly fallen for a guy who isn't available.
I've ended a long term relationship 2 weeks ago because of many reasons, after a year of problems. These past few months I've also fallen pretty badly for a guy friend who is currently in a relationship (for a year or so). It happened gradually, without me really noticing, and now I'm here and it doesn't come with an off switch. The way he acts sometimes makes me think he has feelings for me too, but that just might be me projecting. 

This is the first time I've been single since I've known him. I don't know if he knows I'm single yet. I'm bracing myself for the moment when he finds out or it comes up and I'll have to tell him. I understand how complex and fragile relationships are and it's not like I expect him to drop everything now that I'm single (assuming he even thinks of me that way), but I can't help but wonder... hope... dream...

I would never actually say anything to him at this point, I know my place and am happy to stick to men who are actually available, but I can't help but be a little sad. I'm bracing myself for the disappointment which inevitably is to come. I'd like a metaphorical shoulder to cry on.
