Charge transfer from electrode to water This is something that's bugging me for a while.  Water is conductive because it has ions in it, which move to form a current. But how is the charge transferred from a electrode into the water, and vice versa? Ions can be oxidized and reduced, but both require a certain potential, and we can pass current even below that potential. So how is the circuit completed?
