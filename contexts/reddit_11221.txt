I enjoy hearing my roommates have sex entirely too much.
I don't even want to hear it, but it's apparently the best sex anybody has ever had ever ever, and I can hear every sound through our very thin walls. 

What inspired this topic and made me feel guilty was I could hear him spanking her HARD. **WHACK** and a moan. **WHACK** and a louder moan. I can hear her talking dirty. I can hear how fast he's fucking her because the bed creaks. I can hear them kiss (I assume not just faces). I hear *everything*.

And I feel guilty, because I enjoy listening to it entirely too much. I feel like I should leave when they're going at it, but 1. I don't want to, and 2. They bang it out at random times during the day, usually three or four times, sometimes more.

And yes, I do masturbate to it. And yes, I am aware that's probably creepy as hell.

They just went at it for 45 very intense minutes, ending in an extremely loud female orgasm, and now I think they're doing it again.
