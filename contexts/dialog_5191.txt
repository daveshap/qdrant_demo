SAM: Boss!
RICK: Yeah?
SAM: Boss, ain't you going to bed?
RICK: Not right now.
SAM: Ain't you planning on going to bed in the near future?
RICK: No.
SAM: You ever going to bed?
RICK: No.
SAM: Well, I ain't sleepy either.
RICK: Good. Then have a drink.
SAM: No. Not me, boss.
RICK: Then don't have a drink.
SAM: Boss, let's get out of here.
RICK: No, sir. I'm waiting for a lady.
SAM: Please, boss, let's go. Ain't nothing but trouble for you here.
RICK: She's coming back. I know she's coming back.
SAM: We'll take the car and drive all night. We'll get drunk. We'll go fishing and stay away until she's gone.
RICK: Shut up and go home, will you?
SAM: No, sir. I'm staying right here.
RICK: They grab Ugarte and she walks in. Well, that's the way it goes. One in, one out. Sam?
SAM: Yeah, boss?
RICK: Sam, if it's December 1941 in Casablanca, what time is it in New York?
SAM: Uh, my watch stopped.
RICK: I bet they're asleep in New York. I'll bet they're asleep all over America.
