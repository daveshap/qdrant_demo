How does Warren anti-corruption bill compare to global policy?
Elizabeth Warren has introduced legislation aimed at curbing corruption and introducing mechanisms to enforce accountability, and to democratize large corporations by mandating % of their boards be elected by employees.

I've heard that there are other OCED with policy attempting to accomplish similar goals, but I don't have good exposure to how those policies work or how they compare to Warren's proposal.

**My primary questions are:**

* How does Warren's bill compare to legislation already in place in other countries (ideally implemented long enough ago to have generated good data)
* Is there any reason based on text of the bill that it will be particularly successful or problematic

Also, this is with the caveat that I understand that in current political environment it is likely DOA on the floor, so this discussion is basically just academic.

Edit: I didn't realize that there are actually two bills Warren introduced, and I may be conflating elements of the two. My question really applies to both, as the overall effort appears tied to improving incentives of US business and gov't structure to reduce negative impacts to the public by bad actors.
