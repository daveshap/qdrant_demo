MARY: Toby...thank God...wait here. I gotta find out what's goin' on.
TOBY: Hey. Slow down. What is it?
MARY: Some of Rhodes' men. At the door.
TOBY: That bastard. I didn't think he'd make his move so fast.
MARY: It's because of me.
TOBY: Oh, bullshit, Mary. It's because Rhodes is a prick.
MARY: I want you to leave. Then maybe...
TOBY: We're both gonna leave. Leave the island. I've been talkin' to Tricks. We think we can smuggle out one of those inflatable rafts. They're crated up real small. They've got air canisters. There's food inside. Even a little motor.
MARY: I am not...a guerilla fighter, Toby. I'm not a pioneer. I'm not...I'm not strong that way. I need...
TOBY: Need what? Civilised order like we have down here? Christ!
MARY: I can work here. Maybe my work can help...help everyone. I can do more good with access to this equipment than I can off in some wasteland.
TOBY: For the good of mankind. That's what every monster-maker says.
