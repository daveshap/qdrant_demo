LIZA: Answer me. Was the first time you saw me the first time I saw you? Was it? You've been following me around. Do you see how that could be disconcerting to me? That's not love, Jerry. It's obsession. And it isn't normal and you can't expect me to respond to it and you can't expect me to feel the same way. Can you?
JERRY: I would never hurt you, Liza. Think whatever you want, but don't think that.
LIZA: I don't. I know you wouldn't.
JERRY: I thought you -- Why -- Love ruins everything, doesn't it?
