PROFESSOR DONOVAN: Maiden name -- Daniels. You know her?
ELLE: She was a Delta Gamma! Not in my pledge class or anything -- she graduated five years ahead of me. But I used to take her class at the LA Sports Club. She's amazing!
PROFESSOR DONOVAN: Amazing how?
ELLE: She could make you drop three pounds in one class. She's completely gifted!
PROFESSOR DONOVAN: Well, in all likelihood, she's completely guilty as well. She was seen standing over her husband's dead body.
