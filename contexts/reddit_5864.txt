Can you get a good job without college
I know that college is the go-to thing when you want a good job but I've also heard of how you drown in the college tuitions. I know that people end up paying for those college tuitions till they're 30 or even the rest of their life, I dont think I want that for my future, I dont want to spend like half my life just wondering whether I can pay that off. So my question is can you live comfortably in a job that pays well without going to college?
