SERA: Umm. We can stay in the car for an hour if you want. But I really have to go then. It's your time.
BEN: Right, I'll get your door. I tend to fade in and out lately.
SERA: I guess I do too.
BEN: You what?
SERA: I sometimes fade out.
BEN: Oh... well, maybe we better synchronize our spells... or stagger them.
SERA: You were going to get my door.
