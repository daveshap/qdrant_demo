SELENA: I'm free. I can never thank you enough.
SUPERGIRL: For what?
SELENA: Ever since I found that thing I've been like a prisoner in a terrible nightmare. You have no idea how awful it is to be mean all the time.
SUPERGIRL: Your nightmares are over. I'm taking this back to Argo City where it won't be misused. You could come too. It might be safer for you.
ETHAN: No thanks. I have friends in the resistance. They'll vouch for me. I figure I might get a million bucks for my memoirs.
SUPERGIRL: I'll come back as soon as I can.
