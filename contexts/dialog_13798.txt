LOWELL: You know, I was thinking of calling you tomorrow, anyway. How are your kids handling the new house?
WIGAND: Good. You have kids?
LOWELL'S VOICE: We have a couple. One's hers, one's mine. Everybody uses a different name. Modern marriage. How's Liane?
WIGAND: She's okay.
WIGAND: Hold on a minute, Lowell... ...somebody... may be following me. I don't know. They came on the property...
LOWELL'S VOICE: What do you mean followed you? Did you call the police?
WIGAND: I don't want to be paranoid... I mean, maybe it's a game. Some kind of mind game.
LOWELL'S VOICE: Well, what do you really think, though?
WIGAND: I don't know what the fuck I really think! Are they doing it? Is some crank doing it? Are they doing it to make me feel paranoid? Are they doing it for real and don't give a shit what I think? I don't know! I don't fucking know.
