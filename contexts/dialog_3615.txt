TEHRONNE: Do you call it a game when only one man win each time? I think you call it a damn shame.
LAZARUS: Word wit'cha. In private.
TEHRONNE: You need some weed?
LAZARUS: Been years since I fooled with that. You know a white girl? Dirty blond hair, split down the middle like?
TEHRONNE: That ain't up to me to hook you up. Naw what I mean? She her own, you know?
LAZARUS: Huh?
TEHRONNE: I don't pimp that. You talkin' about who I think you talkin' about, you mean Rae. Rae Doole. Sexy little split tail, like you say. I can't hook you up with that. I got two girls. One ain't in town, the other one pregnant. So... you on your own.
LAZARUS: This Rae... you get with her?
TEHRONNE: Shit. Who hasn't?
LAZARUS: Why you say that?
TEHRONNE: She got a spare minute she'll snatch up anyone... but me, I'm different. Sometimes she need the real deal, so she call me up. Girl got an itch. You know... what's a nigga to do?
LAZARUS: She like it rough? You like beatin' on her?
TEHRONNE: That ain't my scene. If that's somethin' you into...
LAZARUS: Now, hold up.
TEHRONNE: See, that girl is in my favor. You heard me, nigga? You fuck with her rough, and you got me to fuck wit.
LAZARUS: You collar that dog, boy. I ain't gonna hurt nobody. Just wanted to know who she was.
TEHRONNE: Like I say, you wanna hook that up... I ain't in ya way. That switch of hers been all over this town. Got that sickness, you know.
LAZARUS: What'chu sayin'?
TEHRONNE: She a freak. Got what you call a sexual addiction.
LAZARUS: What'chu sayin'?
TEHRONNE: What I'm tellin' you. Girl gotta get dick or she go crazy.
