SSIS ETL or CDC - real time DWH reporting I am currently working on SSIS package for continuous incremental data loads of the tables (40 tables now and expected to increase in near future)  from OLTP system to a Reporting database residing on a different server. The request is for real time data sync between the two sources. Should I continue and test it with just regular SSIS -> Staging -> merge route OR should I look into implementing CDC. Will that be faster than plain old ETL considering the number of tables involved?
