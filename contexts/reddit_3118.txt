I'm 31y old and want to start a career that makes me financially stable in 10 years. Software Development maybe?
Hi

After jumping jobs for about 10y i think its time to focus and learn something. I Know im a little old already but i'm thinking starting a career on software development. I already know a little about programming but what courses should i do? 

Should i invest in computer science course? That would be a college degree that ill take me about 4 years to get done. I read something about FreeCodeCamp its this a good way to start?

Thanks in advance for the help, please if you think another career is better im all ears.
