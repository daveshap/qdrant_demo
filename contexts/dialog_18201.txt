JULIE: You want to leave? But Stu - you're a big hit! Everyone loves you!
STU: They don't love me. They love Monkeybone.
JULIE: It was you who got the standing O. It was you drawing on the belly over there...
STU: That was <u>especially</u> Monkeybone. Come on, Doc, I don't want to be stuck here with this bunch of media creeps. I just want to be <u>us</u>. Home. Alone! <i></i> I have something I have to give you.
JULIE: Can't you give it to me later?
STU: Yeah, I <u>could</u>, but the thing is, if later got here sooner, it would be...better.
HERB: Sorry, Julie - won't be a minute. Now Stu - I know you don't like the idea, but you really ought to talk to these guys -
STU: Julie and I - we were just gonna go...
HERB: Go? There's a potload of money here, pal. You got three major toy companies...you got the guys from Burger God over here...
STU: Burger God. The ones that found the pig hair in the french fries?
HERB: Never proven. They're ready to pop for a pre- emptive endorsement. Kids love Burger God -
STU: Herb, it's too much. It's all out of hand.
HERB: Do you know what kind of opportunity you have here? You gotta <u>strike</u>. I'm talking mansions. Lamborghinis. Champagne for mouthwash when you brush your teeth!
STU: I don't want to be rich. It's just a trap!
HERB: Being rich is <u>not a trap</u>. That is a dirty lie perpetuated by rich people to keep the failures from killing them.
STU: Herb. <u>I have to go</u>.
HERB: Why?
STU: I got the ring. <i></i> Tonight's the night, Herb. Tonight's the night.
HERB: Oh my God...you're proposing?
STU: My life was totally crappy, Herb, and she... fixed it. She made me happy. Which I'd never been. She loves me the way I am - <u>right now</u>. <i></i> I don't want everything to change. I don't want her saying yes to some big success. I just want her saying yes to me.
HERB: ...In some weird way I respect that.
