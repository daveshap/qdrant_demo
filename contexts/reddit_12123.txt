I forget things too easily and I feel stupid at times because of it.
I'll be in a conversation with someone about, say, a new movie. I'll be talking about a scene I thought was cool, get distracted by something moving (like a person, dog, bug, etc.) Then totally forget what i was talking about. Like it takes a lot of mental energy just to remember what I was talking about. You can probably imagine how awkward it makes the conversation.

It seems like a funny thing I do, but what bothers me is that it happens a lot. So much so, I've forgotten what I've been talking about when talking to professionals (i.e. in my field). I fear one day I'll give a presentation and totally forget what I'm talking about. Making a complete fool of myself.
