ELENA: Weightless almost -- as if I were seeing my own memories of being a girl. There was something internal about it.
WENDY: Mom. Are you ok?
ELENA: Wendy, of course. I'm sorry. You must think I'm ripe to be checked into Silver Meadows.
WENDY: You're not a psycho!
ELENA: The people at Silver Meadows aren't psychos.
WENDY: I know. They're rich drug addicts and celebrities. When I saw James Taylor there, and --
ELENA: We've been through this Wendy James Taylor was actually at that clinic up near Boston.
WENDY: Well, I saw what I saw, and if you don't want to believe me --
ELENA: Oh Wendy.
WENDY: They need the money for my band uniform at school.
ELENA: I thought you quit the band - I never hear you practice anymore.
WENDY: I don't really need to practice. I just play a few notes, you know, so I thought maybe I'd stay in.
ELENA: Well, I'm sure your father and I would love to hear what you're playing these days. Maybe after dinner.
