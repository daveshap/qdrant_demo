ADAM: This is pathetic.
MICHEAL: You're pathetic.
ADAM: What did you say?
MICHEAL: You're not a team player.
ADAM: Don't point at me.
MICHEAL: You never were a team player. That's why you never had any friends.
ADAM: I have plenty of friends.
MICHEAL: The hell you do.
ADAM: The hell I don't.
MICHEAL: You have acquaintances - business friends and superficial golf buddies. You have always been a fringe player. You have some serious male on male intimacy problems.
ADAM: What are you fucking talking about?
FISHER: Micheal, now is probably not the best time for this.
BOYD: No, this is the perfect time. This is real time. Adam. Your brother and I, as well as several others present, have always suspected that you... ...are a fully repressed, living in major denial, locked down, fly-boy butt-fucker.
