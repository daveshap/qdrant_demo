Conversion of electrical energy to heat in a circuit How is electrical energy converted to heat in a circuit? I read on quora and other sites that it is due to  how much resistance it receives due to colliding with atoms. However what exactly does it mean to collide with atoms? Is the kinetic energy just transferred to the atom's electrons it interacts with and does that promote the electron to a higher energy state, and when it is de-excited it releases heat in the form of infrared radiation? How does resistance explain why copper is better conductor than iron?
