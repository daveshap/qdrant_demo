DRIVER: Goin' far?
TOM: Just a few miles. I'd a walked her if my dogs wasn't pooped out.
DRIVER: Lookin' for a job?
TOM: No, my old man got a place, forty acres. He's a sharecropper, but we been there a long time.
DRIVER: Oh!
DRIVER: Been doin' a job?
TOM: Yeah.
DRIVER: I seen your hands. You been swinging a pick or a sledge--that shines up your hands. I notice little things like that all the time. Got a trade?
TOM: Why don't you get to it, buddy?
DRIVER: Get to what?
TOM: You know what I mean. You been givin' me a goin' over ever since I got in. Whyn't you go on and ask me where I been?
DRIVER: I don't stick my nose in nobody's business.
TOM: Naw--not much!
DRIVER: I stay in my own yard.
TOM: Listen. That big nose of yours been goin' over me like a sheep in a vegetable patch. But I ain't keepin' it a secret. I been in the penitentiary. Been there four years. Like to know anything else?
DRIVER: You ain't got to get sore.
TOM: Go ahead. Ask me anything you want.
DRIVER: I didn't mean nothing.
TOM: Me neither. I'm just tryin' to get along without shovin' anybody around, that's all. See that road up ahead?
DRIVER: Yeah.
TOM: That's where I get off.
