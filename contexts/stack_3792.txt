CNN for a regression problem I have tons of matrices as inputs and their corresponding outputs, which are also matrices. In other words, my goal is to train a network that would predict me the matrix output based on the matrix input. I believe that there's some dynamics between the matrix elements, thus I prefer CNN. But I don't really know how to approach this, as I can't come up with the output layer. How could I build a network that has both 16x16 matrices as input and output. I'm using keras on R.Thanks!
