Unsure what to do about new job
I started a job this week as an parts/inventory clerk for an emergency automotive company.

The company seems great, my coworkers are nice, but... it’s been 4 days now, and I’ve received exactly 0 training on my job. I keep asking, but my boss is extremely busy, and the person who’s supposed to be training me seems like she actively dislikes me and refuses to do anything, preferring to stay on her phone all day.

Just... I have a lot to learn about this job (I only have inventory background, but not with car parts and stuff) but it feels like there’s no support structure. I want to learn and do well, it seems like a really great job and the pay is good and I enjoy actually supporting emergency vehicles, makes my work, however small, feel like it helps.

What would be a good way to voice my concerns without throwing people with tenure under the bus? I don’t want to be fired for this type of nonsense twice this year. 

Or should I just coast on this job till I find a new one?
