We’re approaching the 20’s, and quite frankly the current (western) dating culture is toxic as hell.
Point blank, with the proliferation of social media and online dating men have debased themselves for womens’ attention and affection so much online that it’s now having real world consequences. Women have stopped respecting men, and men have stopped respecting themselves when it comes to dating. Therefore, due to women being put on a pedestal by men they’ve become entitled and egotistical. Conversely, men have become so labeled and heaped with promiscuous expectations that they are shamed for not being able to find/have sex or a partner while also being shames for trying *too hard** to have/find sex.

Stop. This subreddit is absolutely filled with borderline cringeworthy posts of (mostly men but some women) lamenting their single, lonely lives, but I have this to say:

Fellas, respect yourselves. Don’t let immature, self-obsessed women disrespect you are cast you aside. If a girl friendzones you, don’t stick around. Find other options and better friends. Don’t be an emotional masochist nor an emotional tampon to girls who have no interest in either sleeping with you or being with you. She isn’t worth your time.

Ladies, respect yourselves too. Don’t let bummy ass dudes waste your time or attention, and be upfront and honest with men who you *know* are interested in you even if you’re afraid of “hurting their feelings”. Rejection hurts, but leading men on hurts more. Y’all have zero excuses, and if a guy can’t take no for an answer then, I dunno, report him to police instead of entertaining this weirdo? 

Seriously... I wasn’t sure whether to flair this as a rant or as advice so I chose the latter; however, y’all need to get your act together. Respect in a relationship, platonic or romantic, is the top priority, and if people don’t respect your time, attention, or presence then cut them out of your life. 

Peace <3
