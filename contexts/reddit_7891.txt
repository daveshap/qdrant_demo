Writing skills SOS
How do/did you improve your technical writing skills while in grad school? 

My undergraduate program didn’t have any technical writing component, and my current program doesn’t have any writing seminar courses. On my first journal paper I killed myself writing and re-writing to submit my best work, but my advisor ended up re-writing all of my words in his style, thus I did not improve my writing during this process. What can I do to become a better writer on my own? Books? What can I ask my advisor to help me get better when his answer is to just re-write what I thought was a solid effort? 

If it helps, I’m in engineering.
