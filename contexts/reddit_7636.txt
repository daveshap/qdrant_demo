How do I market myself to industry employers as a biology PhD in a “non-industry” field.
I’m in a developmental biology lab. I enjoy this research, but I’m concerned that finding industry jobs will be difficult because most employers are looking for skill sets that I am not able to gain in my lab.

To add, while I do enjoy developmental biology, I am flexible and both willing and eager to explore other fields after completing my PhD.

If anyone could provide insight or point me towards some resources, I would appreciate it.
