HARRY: I imagine in your line of work, there were times you had to get rough, you know, say one of your customers stopped paying.
CHILI: They always paid.
HARRY: You pack a gun?
CHILI: Not really.
HARRY: What does that mean?
CHILI: Maybe a few times I have.
HARRY: Ever shot anybody.
CHILI: Once.
HARRY: Really? You ever been arrested?
CHILI: I've been picked up a couple times. Loan sharking. Racketeering. But I was never convicted. I'm clean.
HARRY: Racketeering, that covers a lot of ground, doesn't it?
