As of August 30th, the Federal Election Commission (FEC) does not have enough commissioners to hold a quorum. Unable to hold a quorum, the FEC cannot enforce campaign finance law. Is campaign finance law unenforceable until the FEC quorums?
The Federal Election Commission (FEC) currently can't hold a quorum due to a lack of commissioners. Unable to quorum, the [FEC can't conduct regular business](https://www.npr.org/2019/08/30/755523088/as-fec-nears-shutdown-priorities-such-as-stopping-election-interference-on-hold), such as enforcement of campaign finance law, or acting as an advisory to campaigns about following election law:

> Friday [Aug. 30, 2019] will be the last business day that the Federal Election Commission will be able to function for quite a while, leaving the enforcement of federal campaign finance laws unattended ahead of the 2020 election.

> ...

> In addition to collecting campaign finance data, the FEC investigates potential campaign finance violations, issues fines and gives guidance to campaigns about following election law â€” but not without a working quorum of at least four commissioners.

I have a couple of questions on this topic:

1. Aside from the FEC, does any regulatory body, State or Federal, have the ability to investigate presidential candidates for campaign finance violations?

2. What other Federal election laws are under the purview of FEC, and how is their enforcement affected by the FEC's inability to quorum?
