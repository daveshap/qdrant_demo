How to combine limits when integrating in the frequency domain I want to combine the signal of two separate pulses in the frequency domain in order to calculate their overlap (by multiplying the two signals together and integrating). However, one of these signals is a rectangular pulse with a finite bandwidth, while the other has a sech lineshape and therefore an infinite bandwidth. I'm confused about what happens to the limits of my system when I combine the two. Is it just that I take the limits of the finite bandwidth pulse because there will be no overlap outside this range? How would one represent this?
