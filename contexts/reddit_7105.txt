Is this a good way to reach out to startups in my area?
I’ve been applying to companies online and have gotten a few interviews here and there but no offers. 

I want to reach out to several startups in my area. Some of them I’ve had contact with before, some of them would be total cold emails. Are these messages good to send? 

To startups I’ve interacted with before:

“Hi, 

I hope you’re having a good day. My name is X, and we met during Y. I find the work your startup is doing exciting because of [reason], and am interested in being a part of it. I was wondering if you have a need for a [type of role]. I have Z years of experience doing [type of skills], and I can use those skills to help your startup reach more people. You can see some of my work here [link to website] and access my resume here [link to resume]. 

Best,
X”
