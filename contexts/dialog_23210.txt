CAPTAIN: Have you heard?
SOMERSET: No, I haven't heard.
CAPTAIN: There was a second.
SOMERSET: Already.
CAPTAIN: Greed. It was written in blood.
SOMERSET: It's none of my business anymore.
CAPTAIN: I thought you might want to be filled in.
SOMERSET: I'm sure everyone's doing their best.
CAPTAIN: Yeah.
SOMERSET: Good.
CAPTAIN: Come on. What are you going to do with yourself out there?
SOMERSET: I'll get a job, maybe on a farm. I'll work on the house.
CAPTAIN: Can't you feel it yet? Can't you feel that feeling... ? You're not going to be a cop anymore.
SOMERSET: What are you talking about?
CAPTAIN: You know.
SOMERSET: Did you read in the paper today, about the man who was walking his dog? he was attacked, and his wallet and his watch were taken. And then, while he was still lying unconscious, his attacker stabbed him with a knife in both eyes. It happened four blocks from here.
CAPTAIN: I heard.
SOMERSET: I have no understanding of this place anymore.
CAPTAIN: It's always been like this.
SOMERSET: Really?
