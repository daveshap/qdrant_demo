WADE: Where's Ma?
POP: She's coming.
MARGIE: Have you been heating the house? Not just with the stove.
POP: There's a furnace.
MARGIE: You're not using it today?
POP: It's broke I guess. There's an electric in the bedroom.
MARGIE: Maybe Wade should take a look at it. Your pipes'll freeze. Wade, would you do that?
