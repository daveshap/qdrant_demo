Auto generating waypoints to a GPX file along track (hiking path - not as crow flies) I have used Google Maps to build a list of waypoints for a trail I want to hike but the waypoints are simply my start, end and maybe a couple of points of interest for my day and any campgrounds along the route.I now have all of this data in a GPX file for importing into my GPS, but it keeps reporting distance as the crow flies to the next waypoint instead of distance along the trail. I have since learned that the fix is to add a metric boatload of waypoints to my tracks. Is there any way to auto-generate waypoints along the track line between two existing waypoints that follows the trail line instead of line-of-site?I keep seeing people pointing to GPSBabel (but that only does line-of-site) or suggestions to manually add points.
