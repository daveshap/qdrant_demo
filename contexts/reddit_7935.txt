Interview an expert for a master's research paper.
Hi all. I'm in my first class of an online master's program in Public Administration. Unfortunately my professor is not very responsive so I thought I would put this out to the group. Our final is a 10 page research paper and I'm writing mine on Lean management. I have a co-worker whom I would consider an expert on this topic. I plan on using many other sources, both scholarly and otherwise, but it is acceptable to use my co-worker as a viable source as well?
