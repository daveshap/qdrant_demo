Placement Exchange
Hi all! So my state (NY) holds a placement exchange at U Albany in March. I graduate from my program this May and will be looking for international services, admissions or study abroad jobs. I can’t find much information about this event but I have heard that PE’s tend to be res life focused. (I refuse to do res life.) Do you think attending would be worth it? I wouldn’t be able to attend TPE because of costs.
