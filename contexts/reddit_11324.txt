My job is making me racist.
Backstory: I'm an 18 year old male bartender in small town louisiana (that's why I'm so young). It's a predominately black bar so there's constantly rap music blaring, which doesn't bother me all that much. What does bother me is most of the patrons. Mostly 20-30 something year old black men. Now I've never been one for racism but these people are fucking dumb. Could be the alcohol or the drugs that they do IN THE FUCKING BAR! Which is right across the street from a police station. For some reason these people who are ignorant to begin with, get even more ignorant and loud. I cannot sit here without judging these people. And it's sad because I know it's just the alcohol and drugs, but my biggest problem is WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU BLOWING ALL YOUR MONEY HERE!? I KNOW most of them have children and no job. So why are you here paying $5 for a shot of ciroc? Take care of your goddamn kids. Get out of the bar. And act your fucking age. 



I don't know what to do anymore. I feel bad for hating these people, but I do. And it's not all black people just the ones who come here. 



Rant over.
