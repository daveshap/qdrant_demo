JACK: You know, you could work in a wine store.
MILES: Yeah, that would be a good move.
MILES: Are you chewing gum?
JACK: Want some?
MILES: Hey Jack, hurry up!
JACK: Just a minute!
JACK: I thought you said it was close. Now I'm all pitted out.
MILES: It's not even a mile.
JACK: We should have driven.
MILES: Not with the wine list these people have. We don't want to hold back.
JACK: You think I'm making a mistake marrying Christine?
MILES: Whoa.
JACK: Come on, do you think I'm doing the right thing? Tell the truth. You've been through it.
MILES: Well, you waited for good reason, and you proposed to Christine for some good reason. So I think it's great. It's time. You've got to have your eyes open, that's all. I mean, look at me. I thought Victoria and I were set for life.
JACK: Christine's dad -- he's been talking about bringing me into his property business. Showing me the ropes. And that's something, considering how long it took him to get over I'm not Armenian. So I'm thinking about it. But I don't know, might get a little incestuous. But Mike does pretty well. A lot of high-end commercial stuff.
MILES: So you're going to stop acting?
JACK: No way. This would just provide some stability is what I'm saying. I can always squeeze in an audition or a commercial here and there, you know, keep myself in the game in case something big comes along.
MILES: Uh-huh.
JACK: We're not getting any younger, right? And my career, well, it's gotten pretty, you know, frustrating. Even with my new manager. Maybe it's time to settle down.
MILES: If that's what feels right.
JACK: It does. Feels right.
MILES: Then it's a good thing.
JACK: Yeah. It's good. Feels good.
GARY: Hey, Miles. Long time no see.
MILES: Gary.
GARY: When's that novel of yours coming out? We all want to read it.
MILES: Soon, soon. Say, this is my buddy Jack. He's getting married next week.
GARY: My condolences.
MILES: What are you pouring tonight?
GARY: Lot of good stuff. Got the new Bien Nacido. Want a taste?
MILES: Absolutement. They have their own label that's just outstanding.
GARY: What do you think?
MILES: Tight as a nun's asshole but qood concentration. Nice fruit.
JACK: Yeah. Tight.
MILES: Pour us a couple.
JACK: Here's to my last week of freedom.
MILES: It's going to be great. Here's to us.
