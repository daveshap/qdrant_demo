I'm 15 having trouble with socializing with people. How to improve?
I'm 15M in my freshman year and am having trouble socializing at my high school. I haven't done terrible but school isn't great. Talking to people, whether it's guys or girls, scares the shit out of me. If a conversation isn't started by someone else, then I find it so hard to talk to anyone. And if thats not so great, talking with girls who I find attractive is much much worse. Usually if I even talk to them l flounder, I have no idea what to do and am always afraid of coming off as weird, annoying, or creepy. I was wondering how I could be a more open person and improve my terrible social skills.
