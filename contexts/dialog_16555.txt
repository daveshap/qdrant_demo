CONWAY: I guess we're in for it.
LOVETT: In for what?
CONWAY: I don't know. He must have had some purpose in taking the plane away from Fenner. When he lands, we'll find out.
LOVETT: You mean to tell me you're not going to do anything until we land?
CONWAY: What do you suggest?
LOVETT: Why, you - youâ€” Look here - he may dash us to pieces!
CONWAY: It might afford you a great deal of relief. Now gentlemen, I'm going back to sleep. Oh, and I was having such a peaceful dream. As soon as he lands, let me know.
