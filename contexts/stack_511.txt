Want to make space on my computer, show installed apps I don't need and can remove Please can you tell me how to see what I have installed on my computer, so that I can make a judgement call to remove some of the unnecessary programs.  I tried the following code    dpkg -l | grep ii however the number of installed programs just whizzes through the screen so fast.  Is there any way of halting it, or scrolling through the list.  Each up and down arrow I press simply shows me my previous commands. Then I would like some recommendations of what to remove.Thanks in advance.Vince.
