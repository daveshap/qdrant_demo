Is a T test the right thing to do? I have performed a survey which contains 2 logical sets of people (A and B). In my data set there were roughly twice as many respondents in set A as there were in set B.The survey asks \"Do you have a qualification in your field\". So my answers are all Yes or No.I want to know if the difference between the answers is statistically significant.Does a 2 sample t-test work here?
