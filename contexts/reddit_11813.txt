A 'compliment' today made me feel really self-conscious and shitty
A guy randomly came up to me and gave me a strange compliment today - "You have excellent posture", then just walked away. And he's right, I do.

Whether he was being facetious or genuine doesn't matter to me - either way, it made me feel really self-conscious. I have Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, a side effect of which is a curved spine. I've learnt to have this perfect posture to stop me being in chronic pain. To be made so self aware of your own illness, regardless as to whether that was his intention, makes me feel like shit. 

That's all
