NEO: Morpheus, I don't think this is a good idea.
MORPHEUS: Why?
NEO: I told you I don't believe in this stuff. No matter what she says I'm not going to believe it, so what's the point?
MORPHEUS: What do you believe in?
NEO: What do I believe it? Are you kidding me? What do you think? I'm still trying to deal with the fact that everything I believed was real, wasn't. The whole world, my entire life was a lie. I don't know anything anymore, Morpheus.
MORPHEUS: That's why we're here.
NEO: Why? So I can hear some old lady tell me, what? That I'm this guy that everybody's been waiting for? The one that's supposed to save the world? Come on. How do I respond to that? I can't. It's ridiculous. I mean who am I? I'm nobody, I'm just a guy. What did I do, Morpheus? Why me?
MORPHEUS: Faith is beyond the reach of whys and why nots. These things are not a matter of cause and effect, Neo. I do not believe things with my mind. I believe them with my heart. In my gut.
NEO: And you still believe I'm the One?
MORPHEUS: Yes I do.
NEO: Yeah? What about the other five guys? The five before me? What about them?
NEO: Did you believe in them too?
MORPHEUS: No. I did not. I have never told anyone this, Neo. After I saw the Oracle I thought... no, I misunderstood what she told me. I believed that it was all about me. That I would find the One, not that he would find me.
