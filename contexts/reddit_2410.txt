Why do employers and candidates play these little charades during the interview/hiring process?
I am a recent graduate looking for a job and it bothers me to no end that employers seem to come up with the most ridiculous things to do/ questions to answer for applicants during the hiring process. Tests that can be faked or you later find out don't attribute to the hiring decision. Questions you can just lie about to get in their good graces. Questions employers know everyone is going to answer the same anyway even if it is not true. 

"Now Mr.Smith, this is a prestigous position (it is not but whatever), so we are only looking for people who are hard workers. Are you a hard worker?" -\_- .....

I mean, seriously what they hell is this? Why do employers do this? Can somebody please explain this? Also if this is some kind of jedi mind trick voodoo bullsh\*t HR people learn during the education can somebody point me to the resource teaching them this because atleast then I can put my mind at rest again.

Thanks in advance, and apologies for the saltiness of my post.
