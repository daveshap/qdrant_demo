RU'AFO: Admiral Dougherty will not be joining us for diner. Deploy the collector. Do you have a problem with those orders?
GALLATIN: May I talk to you alone?
RU'AFO: Deploy the collector.
GALLATIN: Moving them is one thing. Killing them all...
RU'AFO: No one hated them more than you, Gal'na. We've come a long way together. This is the moment we've planned for so many years...
RU'AFO: Separate the Starfleet personnel and secure them in the aft cargo hold... see that Picard joins them...
GALLATIN: The shields in that section won't protect them against the thermolytic reaction...
RU'AFO: Thank-you for reminding me.
