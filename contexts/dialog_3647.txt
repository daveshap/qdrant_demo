ANGELA: I's thinkin' about singing in the choir.
LAZARUS: At church?
ANGELA: Mm-hm. I don't know if I got a good voice or not but... practice is only on Mondays and Wednesdays, so...
LAZARUS: You gonna sing me somethin'?
ANGELA: When? Now? Oh. No.
LAZARUS: Come on, just a little somethin'. Right here. Go'on now, don't be shy.
