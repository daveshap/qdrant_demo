LILA: We should have asked for Cabin One... The one Mary was in.
SAM: I'm glad we didn't.
LILA: We have to go into that cabin and search it, Sam... no matter what we're afraid of finding and no matter how much it may hurt.
SAM: I know. Do you think if something happened, it happened there?
LILA: Sam, if you owned a useless business like this motel... one you probably couldn't even sell... what would you need to get away, to start a new business, somewhere else? Forty thousand dollars?
SAM: How could we prove... Well, if he opens a new motel on the new highway... say, a year from now...
LILA: There must be some proof that exists right now! Something that proves he got that money away from Mary... Some way!
SAM: What makes you sound so certain?
LILA: Arbogast! Sam, he liked me... or felt sorry for me... and he was starting to feel the same about you. I heard it when he called... in his voice, a caring. He wouldn't have gone anywhere or done anything without telling us. Unless he was stopped. And he was stopped, so he must have found out something!
