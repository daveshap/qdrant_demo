Graduating next year with a BS in Psychology at the age of 30 with a lowish GPA (3.1). What jobs do I qualify for to become an ACTUAL career?
The title is self-explanatory; possibly a bit vague. I was hoping to go to grad school, but that seems hard with my GPA. I would like to work a job that I can find growth and not a glass ceiling. Stable income that can grow nicely with experience, as well as growth within the company or my title to carry to other organizations would be ideal. I was thinking I would qualify for HR or office manager jobs. Any advice is helpful! Thanks!
