I am Maria Yuan, founder of IssueVoter.org, here to talk about civic engagement, civic tech, being nonpartisan, sending >250k opinions to Congress, & anything else. AMA!
**About me:** Maria Yuan is the Founder of IssueVoter, a non-partisan platform that offers everyone a voice in our democracy by making civic engagement accessible, impactful, & efficient. Maria’s political experience includes introducing and passing a bill as a constituent, working in a State Representative’s office in Texas, and managing and winning one of the most targeted races in Iowa – an open seat in a swing district.

**About IssueVoter:** Individuals use IssueVoter to get alerts about new bills related to issues they care about, send opinions to their Representative before Congress votes, and track how often s/he represents them. IssueVoter is the only site that summarizes legislation in laymen's terms, along with bullet points from both sides, and offers a truly personalized representative scorecard.
