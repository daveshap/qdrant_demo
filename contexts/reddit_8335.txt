Can the Attorney General or the President fire Geoffrey Berman, the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York?
Late yesterday, Attorney General Bill Barr said in a [press release](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-william-p-barr-nomination-jay-clayton-serve-us-attorney-southern-district) that the chief prosecutor for SDNY, US Attorney Geoffrey Berman, was "stepping down" from that position. The administration [named a new acting head of the office](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/president-donald-trump-fires-us-attorney-southern-district/story?id=71357518) and also disclosed who they would be nominating as the permanent replacement. However, Berman responded by releasing a [statement](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/statement-us-attorney-geoffrey-s-berman-announcement-attorney-general-barr) ([mirror](https://twitter.com/SDNYnews/status/1274178732476059650/photo/1)) saying he wasn't leaving:

> I have not resigned, and have no intention of resigning, my position, to which I was appointed by the Judges of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.  I will step down when a presidentially appointed nominee is confirmed by the Senate.  Until then, our investigations will move forward without delay or interruption.


This situation sets up an unusual conflict. Generally, [the AG has the right to fire any prosecutor,](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-justice/defiant-u-s-prosecutor-fired-by-trump-administration-idUSKBN16I0PZ) but the special circumstance here is that Berman was not actually confirmed by the Senate, but rather, was [appointed by the judges of the district.](https://web.archive.org/web/20200524214610/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/25/nyregion/geoffrey-berman-us-attorney-manhattan.html)

That being the case, can the AG or President actually fire him? What can they do if he refuses to leave? What are the wider implications of a confrontation like this with a prosecutor who is in charge of the district [where the president's businesses operate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trump_Organization) and office that has [prosecuted many of his associates?](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/09/new-york-southern-district-donald-trump-inauguration-prosecutors)

UPDATE 1: AG Barr sent a [letter](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6953481-6-20-20-Barr-Letter-to-Berman.html) to Berman advising him that he has been fired by the President, citing the precedent that allows the President to remove him even without a Senate confirmed replacement, and addressing Berman's implication that current investigations are in jeopardy. By contrast, the President [claims no involvement in any of it.](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/20/politics/trump-fires-berman-barr-says/index.html)

UPDATE 2: Standoff ends as [Berman resigns:](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-justice-newyork-barr-berman/stand-off-with-attorney-general-barr-ends-as-new-york-prosecutor-agrees-to-resign-idUSKBN23R0VZ?il=0) “In light of Attorney General Barr’s decision to respect the normal operation of law and have Deputy U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss become Acting U.S. Attorney, I will be leaving the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, effective immediately.” [Berman's full statement.](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/statement-geoffrey-s-berman)
