JACK: Never even had a sword in my hand until yesterday.
OONA: Then, tis not for chastity? Methought you kept a naked blade twixt you and any maiden chanced spend the night.
JACK: I live in an abandoned fox den neath the roots of a thousand-year-old oak. My bed is pine boughs and rabbit skins. There's no need of weaponry to keep the maids away.
OONA: I'm partial to oaks, as are all faerie folk. Mayn't I come visit sometime?
JACK: I'd be honored.
OONA: Only that?
JACK: And charmed, of course.
OONA: Fie! Don't speak of charms. I should charm you for being so dull- witted.
JACK: I had no thought of offending you, Oona.
OONA: Do I not please you, Jack?
JACK: In every way.
OONA: And am I not fair?
JACK: Wondrously so.
OONA: Then why do you speak sweeter words to Jenny Greenteeth?
JACK: That was in jest.
OONA: Jest with me then.
JACK: How so?
OONA: Tell me I'm fair, as you did the hag.
JACK: You are fair as the first new flower of spring...
OONA: And sweet?
JACK: Sweeter than bee pollen on a summer wind.
OONA: Pray you be sweet as your words, dear Jack.
JACK: Nay, Oona, tis not possible.
OONA: A faerie's love makes anything possible.
JACK: I'm promised to another!
OONA: What shape I take matters not. Long you for another? I'll give you your heart's desire.
