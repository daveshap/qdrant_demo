The idea of self-love is absolutely preposterous to me still.
I've been in various forms of therapy for most of my life, and yet still, the idea that I should "love" myself still seems just absolutely preposterous. *Why* should I love myself? I'm an envious, bitter, hateful, very unwell person as a result of what I've been through in my life, and the notion that I ought to love what I am is just ridiculous. I get that it's like a snake eating its own tail and that "loving myself" could reduce my negative personal qualities, but I struggle seeing anything lovable about me whatsoever. 

I've done positive affirmations, I've written letters to myself, I've hugged myself at times even, and I've written out list after list of my positive attributes. Nothing helps make the idea of loving myself at all easier. 

Anyone else struggle with this?
