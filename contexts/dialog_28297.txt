MARY'S DAD: Yeah? What do you want?
TED: Um, hi, I'm Ted Peloquin. I'm here to take Mary to the prom.
MARY'S DAD: Prom? You're about twenty minutes late. She just left for the prom with her boyfriend Woogie.
MARY'S MOM: Charlie, that's mean. Come on in, Ted. Don't listen to Mr. Wise Guy here. He's a joke a minute.
TED: Oh. Oh, that's a good one.
