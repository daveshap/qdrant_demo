Hiring manager told me HR will call with next steps that include drug test...
Is drug testing a part of on boarding? 
I know at my previous job I accepted a job offer and had to undergo a background check and drug testing. 

This is a different company and I don’t know if this job offers a job after the drug test or it’s just part of onboarding. 

All the hiring manager said was HR will call with drug testing and to talk about compensation. 
Help?
