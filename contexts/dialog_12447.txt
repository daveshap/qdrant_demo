CENOBITE: The box... you opened it. We came.
KIRSTY: It's just a puzzle box.
CENOBITE: It's a means to summon us -- it's called the Lament Configuration.
KIRSTY: Who are you?
CENOBITE: Cenobites. Explorers in the further regions of experience. Demons to some. Angels to others.
KIRSTY: Well, I didn't mean to open that thing. You can go back wherever you came from.
