ALEX: He's here.
DR. HIRSCH: Is he all right? Why didn't you call me? Where was he?
ALEX: He doesn't remember. He woke up at the zoo.
DR. HIRSCH: The zoo? Is he rational?
ALEX: Yes, he is. He's very excited and confused, but he's not crazy, if that's what you mean.
DR. HIRSCH: Have you read the papers today? Have you listened to the radio or television?
ALEX: No, why?
DR. HIRSCH: Is David acting strangely?
ALEX: No, not really.
DR. HIRSCH: Could you get here without any trouble?
ALEX: Yes, I should think so.
DR. HIRSCH: Right. Now listen carefully. I want you to bring David here. I want him in my care. I'll notify the police that we've found him. It is imperative that you bring him straight to the hospital. Do you understand?
ALEX: Yes, Doctor.
DR. HIRSCH: You're certain he's lucid? You won't need any help?
ALEX: He's fine. We'll come right over.
DR. HIRSCH: Shall I send a car?
ALEX: No, a cab will be faster.
DR. HIRSCH: I expect you shortly.
