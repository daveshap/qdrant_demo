DICK: I'm me... I mean, that's me.
RAVENCROFT: Step inside.
RAVENCROFT: Well, the part you're reading for is one of the bad guys. There's Brian and Marty. Peter Breck's already been cast as Brian. And you're reading for the part of Marty. Now in this scene you're both in a car and Bill Shatner's hanging on the hood. And what you're trying to do is get him off. Whenever you're ready.
DICK: Where'd you come from?
RAVENCROFT: I don't know. He just appeared as magic.
DICK: Well, don't just sit there, shoot him.
RAVENCROFT: That was very good.
DICK: Thank you.
RAVENCROFT: If we decided on making him a New York type, could you do that?
DICK: Sure. No problem.
RAVENCROFT: Could we try it now?
DICK: Absolutely.
DICK: Where'd he come from?
RAVENCROFT: I don't know. He just appeared as magic.
DICK: Well, don't just sit there, shoot him.
