* What are the pros and cons for the elimination of SUPERDELEGATES in US Primary Elections

[In American politics, a superdelegate is an unpledged delegate to the Democratic National Convention who is seated automatically and chooses for themselves for whom they vote... At least in name, superdelegates are not involved in the Republican Party nomination process. There are delegates to the Republican National Convention who are seated automatically, but they are limited to three per state, consisting of the state chairperson and two district-level committee members. Republican Party superdelegates are obliged to vote for their state's popular vote winner under the rules of the party branch to which they belong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superdelegate).

The Democrats "[accepted recommendations to reduce the influence of superdelegates but chose to delay making specific changes" until June..](http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/377733-democrats-delay-change-to-convention-superdelegates) This could result in [a rejection of the Democratic Party’s Unity Reform Commission recommendations for a 60% cut](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/12/09/dnc-superdelegates-unity-commission-288634).

* Do superdelegates only have a [“perceived influence”](http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/377733-democrats-delay-change-to-convention-superdelegates) or do they [actually influence elections](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/antonio-moore/how-super-delegates-decid_b_10098414.html)?
