I got a crush
I'm a 13 y/o who has a big crush towards this girl. She's in high honors, and I'm just in honors. We do have the same four classes together (i.e. social studies, math, science and English) I am doing really bad in English, and I really want to stay in classes together with her. I've gave little signs to my friends, hinting how I have a crush on her. 
She also comes up to me sometimes and just says "Hi". (She kind of does it in a quiet, awkward Manor somethimes) I kind of get a little bloodrush when she does that, (That probably wasn't the best choice of words to use, but I don't know how I would describe it. I'm also writing this late at night, 10:14 now) All I'm asking for is some advice. (P.S. I have already failed English class so no need in helping me in that)

TL;DR I've had a few other girls also come up to me saying "Hi"/"By"
