WELLES: How about Howard Hughes? We could do Hughes
MANK: I'm not fucking with Hughes. That shit-kicker would kill us dead, baby. Just like Jean Harlow
WELLES: Howard Hughes killed Jean Harlow?
MANK: Sure. Dropped her out of his Lockheed over Utah
MARION: And we would hear them scuttling around at night with their little red eyes and little yellow t-t- teeth and I'm just imagining plague lice jumpin' all over the damn place So we set t-t-traps everywhere. And every morning we would find the t-t-traps sprung but no mice!
CAROLE LOMBARD: Houdini mice.
