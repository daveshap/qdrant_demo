Does anyone else feel cringe trying to have a normal conversation?
no matter what I try and think of saying, I always think it's cringe or just wierd to say even if it isn't.
does anyone else have this problem? and if so how do you get around this thought in your head stopping you from having a conversation or keeping a good one flowing? I just don't know what to say off the top of my head so I need to think what to say but whatever I come up with just doesn't feel like it's either worth saying or just sounds dumb
