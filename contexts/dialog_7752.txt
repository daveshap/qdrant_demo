GROUCHO: Late again, eh? You haven't been on time once since this war started... Get out there and fight...
CHICO: I can't do it...
GROUCHO: Why not? You're the Secretary of War, aren't you?
CHICO: Yes, but I'm not working for you any more. I'm on the other side.
GROUCHO: Is that so? I used to think you were two-faced - but you can't be - or you wouldn't be wearing that one. Now - let's talk this thing over.
GROUCHO: Now -- how many men you got in your army?
CHICO: Well, we gotta one hundred thousand men.
GROUCHO: That's not fair -- we've only got fifty thousand.
CHICO: That's all right. We let you have twenty-five thousand men -- and we both start even.
GROUCHO: That's the spirit -- fifty-fifty.
CHICO: No. Seventy-five -- seventy-five.
GROUCHO: Well, we'll let that one go. Now -- how many battalions you got?
CHICO: We gotta two battalions and one Frenchman.
GROUCHO: I wish you were still working for me, so I could ask you to resign. How're ya fixed for cavalry?
CHICO: I've gotta five thousand men but no horses.
GROUCHO: That's funny, we've got five thousand horses but no men.
CHICO: That's all right -- our men can ride your horses.
GROUCHO: Not a bad idea. If our horses get tired they can ride your men for a change. Now, I don't mind letting you have our horses, but you must promise to put them through their maneuvers.
CHICO: Oh, sure. We have horse maneuvers every morning.
