DARREN: What are you doing here?
MAX: I live here... Guess I don't have to ask what you're doing here.
DARREN: You're roommates?
KENDRA: Some of us are trying to sleep.
DARREN: You didn't tell me you lived with her.
KENDRA: You know each other?
MAX: He's a mistake I made about six months before you did. But don't feel bad. Justine made the same mistake, along with Renee, Jada, Tia, Brooke--
KENDRA: Yech...
DARREN: Nothing happened between me and Tia.
KENDRA: Leave. Now.
DARREN: Can I say something in my defense?
KENDRA: No.
