Thankful for black beans and jasmine rice today!
Money has been tight for me, like it's been tight for everyone I imagine. I have had to go without eating for a couple days at a time due to lack of funds. My last trip to the food bank, I was given 5 cans of black beans, a bag of jasmine rice, a loaf of bread and a box of knock off frosted flakes. That's how low of a quantity things have gotten. But I didn't complain, said thank you and went home.

Today I cooked. Plain jasmine rice on the stove and a can of black beans  with some salt, pepper, paprika and Adobo seasoning. Mixed the beans and rice together and sprinkled some shredded cheese on top. It isn't the greatest tasting thing, but it filled my belly up and it's one more day I don't have to worry about what I'm going to eat. It's the little things to be thankful for right now.
