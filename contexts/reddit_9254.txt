No, I want to pay the full balance.
Called yesterday to make my internet payment. Up until now, we were doing the past due balance, payment extensions and post dated checks. The lady on the line sounded surprised when I said I wanted to pay the past due AND the current balance. Little victory, but feels amazing to be current on one bill. 

Edit: thank you kind stranger for the gold. My next drink is to your health and happiness.
