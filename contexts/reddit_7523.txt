How do you know a doctorate program is right for you?
I’m beginning my masters in clinical psych with specifications in forensics and applied research. I love the justice system as well as why people do what they do, their social influences, and what made them go down the path that they’re on. 

After my MS, I planned on going into a doctorate program, I don’t really care if it’s a PsyD or clinical PhD. I’m open to both. 

I had a conversation with my mom yesterday and she’s 100% against a doctorate. However, she also knows nothing about doctorate programs. I attempted to tell her about TAs, assistantships and so on but she didn’t want to hear it. Her theory is it’s a whole lot of time with little pay off. 

I obviously tend to disagree with her. But it leads me to the question, how do you know when a doctorate is right for you? Especially wanting to go into forensics I almost have to get a doctorate.
