She sounded so happy to be going on her last walk.
I thought there was a chance I wasn't going to be a wreck today. Finally nutted up enough to go to my initial therapy appointment last night, managed to admit out loud to another human being that I've been feeling suicidal. Come home, emotionally exhausted, to be told we're putting my childhood dog down today. 

She's old, arthritic, covered in sores, and miserable. It is her time. I just. god dammit. i was having enough trouble handling feelings as it was. i was even almost handling it okay until i heard her barking and excited to go on what would end up being her last walk. she didn't know it's her last walk. she was just happy.

i don't know how i'm going to finish work today. i don't. *fuck*.
