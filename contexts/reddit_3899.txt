Stop Stigmatizing Virginity
Some of us are virgins in our 20s or older not because we are religious, prudes, asexual or crazy but maybe just maybe we would like to do it with someone who respects and cares for us as people and not objects for their sexual pleasure.

Edit: I'm a virgin for several reasons. One i cannot be aroused by someone I have no emotional intimacy with. I rather sleep with a old friend of mine, even with the bad history we had, then a man I know knows nothing about me and will never be interested in how I feel what I have to say.

2. 99.9 of men who approached me wanted to sleep with me without even knowing my name while claiming to want a relationship. But their insistence on sexualizimg the conversation and going to their house so early in dating revealed their true intentions.

3. I am a introvert and I had very few if any friends throughout my life until fairly recently when I joined a commune. Even then my social network is pretty small and that translates to less opportunities to meet men thay may share my interests in real life. So I have to go through the trash on online apps in hopes of finding that one gem of a guy out of 100s that is interesting, interested in me and respects my boundaries and is not interested in hooking up. It's very hard to find.

Edit 2: I am so happy at how many people resonated with this. Its great to be reminded you are not alone and a freak of nature, even when the society around you treats you like one for being a virgin. I never expected the amount of responses and support I got from people lol. Also, positive note I met a guy today and he was very chill, respectful. Maybe because he is Eritrean ? I got no idea lol but it was a good 4 hour walk and talk.
