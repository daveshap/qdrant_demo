EXLEY: The Nite Owl. Anything bothering you about the case?
PINKER: Yeah. The fact that you guys won't let it get filed away.
EXLEY: What are you talking about?
PINKER: Bud White grilled me on it this morning. You know, he's not as dumb as I thought.
MRS. LEFFERTS: Let my Susie rest in peace!
EXLEY: Mrs. Lefferts, I just want to ask a few questions.
MRS. LEFFERTS: That other policeman already checked under the house and found not a thing amiss.
EXLEY: Officer White?
MRS. LEFFERTS: A sweet man.
EXLEY: Under the house.
MRS. LEFFERTS: All he found were rodents. No signs of foul play. So there.
MRS. LEFFERTS: My daughter was a virgin!
EXLEY: I don't doubt it -- Oh, God.
