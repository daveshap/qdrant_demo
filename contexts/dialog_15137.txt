RUBY: I think I'm onto something, Joe.
SENA: Me too. I'm drunk.
RUBY: Well, I'm onto something more useful. You ever hear of a man named Fred Krueger?
SENA: Krueger... doesn't ring a bell.
RUBY: He was a child killer in the late sixties... in a town called Springwood about eight miles from here. Guess what his murder weapon was? A glove with six-inch blades.
SENA: Fascinating.
RUBY: Now.... according to the file, Krueger was burned to death in a fire in 1968. But get this -- beginning in 1984, there was _another_ series of murders in Springwood. All teenagers... all killed in their sleep... all killed with finger blades just like Krueger's.
SENA: I thought you said Krueger burned to death.
RUBY: That's right. The murders in the eighties were never solved. But... there were teenaged witnesses who said Krueger had the ability to appear in your dreams... and that if he killed you in a dream, it would kill you in the real world.
SENA: Uh-huh...
RUBY: Don't you see? Jason was _asleep_. And he was dreaming -- the REM patterns prove that. And I saw finger blades just like Krueger's come out of Jason's chest. There has to be a connection.
SENA: Yeah... I think I understand... You're drunk, too.
