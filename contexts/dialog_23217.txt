SOMERSET: He's preaching.
MILLS: Punishing.
SOMERSET: The sins were used in medieval sermons. There were seven cardinal virtues, and then seven deadly sins, created as a learning tool, because they distract from true worship.
MILLS: Like in the Parson's Tale, and Dante.
SOMERSET: Did you read them?
MILLS: Yeah. Parts of them. Anyway, in Purgatory, Dante and his buddy are climbing up that big mountain... seeing all these other guys who sinned...
SOMERSET: Seven Terraces of Purgation.
MILLS: Right. But there, pride comes first, not gluttony. The sins are in a different order.
SOMERSET: For now, let's just consider the books as the murderer's inspiration. The books and sermons are about atonement for sin. And, these murders have been like forced attrition.
MILLS: Forced what?
SOMERSET: Attrition. When you regret your sins, but not because you love God.
MILLS: Like, because someone's holding a gun on you.
SOMERSET: No fingerprints?
MILLS: Nothing.
SOMERSET: Totally unrelated victims.
SOMERSET: No witnesses of any kind?
MILLS: None. Which I don't understand. He had to get back out.
