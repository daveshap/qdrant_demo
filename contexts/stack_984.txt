How can one copy the entire contents of a Linux Terminal / \"man\" pages to a a text editor (gedit in this instance)? Before I start - I am a 69-year-old Linux newbee - take it easy on me!Is there an easy way to copy the entire contents of a Terminal (many pages) - \"man pages\which I am told are not the same as Terminal pages but look the same to newbee me - see comment below - so that I can transfer it to a text editor?  Presently I have to highlight and copy one page at a time, which is rather laborious.I have seen the explanations of how to copy only a section of the contents of a many-paged Terminal - and this is a little tricky for me - - - I was hoping there was a quick and easy way to do the entire contents?Thank you for your patience.
