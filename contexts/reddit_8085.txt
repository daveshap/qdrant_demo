Is it typical to not know how you’re funded/where the research funds come from?
Hi all, I’m an engineering grad student. My advisor has switched the source accounts that pay my stipend a few times and I don’t know the account number used for ordering supplies. Is this typical? When I ask my advisor about how I’m paid, I’m told that students shouldn’t be concerned with this stuff. The issue is I originally came in on an intramural fellowship that came with an annual travel award and I would like to use those travel funds for a conference. I’m planning on calling the business office to check but I’m wondering if this situation is normal?
