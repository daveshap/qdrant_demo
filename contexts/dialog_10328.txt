NICKY: Shoot him.
ELLIOT: The American theater doesn't need people like that.
NICKY: Shoot him, Nicky. Not that we really mean it. But where does he live?
ELLIOT: Keep going west. Last building before the river.
NICKY: How do you Eknow.
ELLIOT: Paisley Porter.
NICKY: What do you mean?
ELLIOT: About an hour and a half ago. I saw her come out of a place. She said she was visiting a friend. But she wouldn't tell me who.
NICKY: Had to be him.
ELLIOT: She was very evasive.
