JESSE: Zee.
ZEE: Jesse. What are you thinking? There are bounty hunters and lawmen all over this county!
JESSE: I had to see you. I'm getting married.
ZEE: I don't understand.
JESSE: She's the most wonderful woman in the world. Can't get her out of my mind.
ZEE: That's... wonderful. It's just... I thought...
JESSE: She's beautiful. Smart. And has the biggest... buck teeth in all of Missouri.
