SHINZON: I am, Commander Riker... May I touch your hair?
PICARD: Praetor, we've come to Romulus on a matter we were -- assured was of great importance. If you have anything to say to us as representatives of the Federation, I suggest you do so now.
SHINZON: On the world I come from there's no light. No sun. Beauty isn't important. I see now there's a world elsewhere.
PICARD: Praetor Shinzon. We’re not here to discuss your lack of a social life.
SHINZON: Yes, I'm sorry, Captain. There's so much we have to talk about.
PICARD: I would be interested to know what we are talking about.
SHINZON: Unity, Captain! Tearing down the walls between us to recognize we are one people. Federation and Romulan. Human and Vulcan and Klingon and Reman. I'm speaking of the thing that makes us the same. We want peace.
SHINZON: I want to end the centuries of mistrust. I want to be your ally, not your enemy. As a first step I propose we eliminate the Neutral Zone and begin a free and open exchange of goods and ideas.
PICARD: And the Senate supports you?
SHINZON: I have dissolved the Senate.
SHINZON: Right now, you’re thinking this all sounds too good to be true?
PICARD: Yes.
SHINZON: And you're wondering why the Scimitar is so well armed. Is this the ship of a peacemaker? Or a predator?.
SHINZON: But you're also thinking the chance for peace is too promising to ignore. Above allyou're trying to decide if you can trust me.
PICARD: Yes.
SHINZON: Then perhaps the time has come to add some illumination to our discussion. Computer, raise lighting four levels.
