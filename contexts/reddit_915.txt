Todays 365 days clean of self harm
I did it, i finally hit a year of being clean. Its been really hard but i finally did it. Now that im a year clean i can finally get my scars covered with tattoos that iv been wanting. I made a promise that if i was clean for a year i could get them covered! No i just gotta start saving. This is a massive step for me. Im proud of myself
