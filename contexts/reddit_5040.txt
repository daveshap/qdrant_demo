[UK] Question about GCSEs/Work Gaps and your CV
If I gave full details this would honestly turn into an essay, as the last few years have been a bit complicated for me, but my question is fairly simple:

I have three large gaps of unemployment (Some time in 1999-2001, Jan 2013-Sept 2014, and Oct 2017-Present Day, I travelled from Sept 2019-May 2020), and I have bad GCSEs (mostly Cs, some Ds, and an E in Maths cos I'm dyscalculate).

I know how to word my job descriptions and skill-sets to sound impressive, don't need advice with that - but those gaps and that bad education just screws me over. How do I make THEM sound impressive, or at least less bad?

Despite having 10 years experience as a Legal Sec, and 2 years as a Support Worker in a hospital, I can't get a job because they want *recent* experience and all these certificates and quals that I just don't have and can't afford to get.

I get nothing but rejections. 300+ jobs since 2017, two interviews that lasted like 5 minutes each, and about 50 rejections. The rest were ignored entirely.

Thoughts, please?
