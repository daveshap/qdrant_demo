GABE: Jessie! Are you alright?
QUALEN: I want the money--meet me at the highest point from where you are. Don't do it and we're going to see if your angel here can fly. Copy?
GABE: Copy. Jessie, go to the top of Bitker ladder.
QUALEN: Love's a killer, isn't it?
HAL: What are we going to do?
GABE: Give him the money.
HAL: I'm going with you.
GABE: Not on that leg.
HAL: Take the gun.
GABE: You keep it. Get up there if you can, and if you get a chance, do me a favor and kill him.
QUALEN: Where are you, Walker?
GABE: You're getting warmer!
