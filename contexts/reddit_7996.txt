Is an iPad (or similar device) worth what itâ€™ll cost as a PhD student?
I currently have a mid-range Dell laptop (RIP my MacBook Pro, how I miss you) that works fine but is large, heavy, and difficult to transport. Iâ€™ve been thinking about getting an iPad for reading and annotating papers for research/working on my dissertation prospectus on the go. I just canâ€™t decide if itâ€™s worth the cost. 

I have students and colleagues who swear by the iPad Pro, but at what itâ€™ll cost me, it almost seems like itâ€™d be better to save up a little longer and get a MacBook again. The iPad Mini seems attractive though for its smaller size but good specs. The plain iPad would be the budget choice of course, but I donâ€™t know if it would be sufficient. 

What do you all think? Do you use tablets on the day to day in grad school/academia?

Edit: Iâ€™m a literature PhD student for what thatâ€™s worth 

TL;DR - Iâ€™m considering getting a tablet to use in conjunction with my ungainly (but functional) laptop for grad school and canâ€™t decide if itâ€™s worth the cost.

Edit 2: Thank you all SO MUCH for the great advice! This is exactly what I needed - the perspective of fellow grad students ðŸ˜Š
