BISHOP: He was accused of jury tampering.
ALITO: Accused. Not indicted. He resigned the firm. Divorced nineteen seventy. Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in 'seventy- eight. Since then he's been on his own. Four cases before the Circuit Court. He lost them all. He drinks.
BISHOP: Four cases in three years...
ALITO: The man's an ambulance chaser...
BISHOP: ...tell me about this case.
ALITO: This is a nuisance suit. He's looking for small change. He's asking for six hundred thousand and betting we don't want to go to court.
BISHOP: No -- we don't want this case in court.
ALITO: Neither does he. That's where he loses. This man's scared to death to go to court. We only have to call his bluff.
BISHOP: I want to settle this thing and be done with it. I don't want the Archdiocese exposed.
ALITO: No. Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not.
BISHOP: So what I want to do is stop it here. I'm going to make him an offer. I want to do it myself. I want it to come from me.
ALITO: All right. But let's keep the price down. I've called Ed Concannon. He recommends that we continue to respond as if we're going to trial.
BISHOP: If we were to go to trial, would we win the case?
ALITO: Well, of course, it's always dangerous...
BISHOP: I know that answer. If we went to trial would we win?
ALITO: Yes.
