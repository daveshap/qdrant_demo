SIMON: Let's face it, Harry, the Vette gets 'em wet. But it's not enough. If you want to really close escrow, you gotta have an angle.
HARRY: And you've got one.
SIMON: It's killer. Look at me-- I'm not that much to look at. No really. I can be honest. But I got 'em lining up, and not just skanks, either. Some are.
HARRY: So what's your angle?
SIMON: Sorry. Trade secret.
HARRY: Sure. Set me up and then don't tell me.
SIMON: Okay, just ask yourself. What do women really want? You take these bored housewives, married to the same guy for years. Stuck in a rut. They need some release. The promise of adventure. A hint of danger. I create that for them.
HARRY: So you're basically lying your ass off the whole time? I couldn't do it.
SIMON: Well, think of it as playing a role. It's fantasy. You have to work on their dreams. Get them out of their daily suburban grind for a few hours.
HARRY: Isn't that hard to keep up, in the long run?
SIMON: Doesn't matter. I like change. You know, constant turnover. As soon as I close the deal, it's one of two more times, then adios.
HARRY: Use 'em and lose 'em.
SIMON: Exactly. The trick is, you gotta pick your target. They have to be nice little housewife types. School-teachers. But, I'm telling you, you get their pilot lit, these babes, they can suck- start a leaf-blower.
HARRY: What about the husbands?
SIMON: Dickless. If they took care of				* business, I'd be out of business, know what I mean?
HARRY: Those idiots.
HARRY: You working on someone right now?
SIMON: I always have a couple on the hook. You know. There's one right now, I've got her panting like a dog. It's great.
HARRY: What does she do?
SIMON: Some kinda legal secretary of something. Married to some boring jerk.
