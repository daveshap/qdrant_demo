NELL: They're so beautiful. Aren't they?
MRS. DUDLEY: I've seen 'em. Lot to dust.
NELL: Well, I've never lived with beauty. You must love working here.
MRS. DUDLEY: It's a job. I keep banker's hours. I set dinner on the dining room sideboard at six. You can serve yourselves. Breakfast is ready at nine. I don't wait on people. I don't stay after dinner. Not after it begins to get dark. I leave before dark comes. We live in town. Nine miles. So there won't be anyone around if you need help. We couldn't even hear you, in the night.
NELL: Why would we --
MRS. DUDLEY: -- no one could. No one lives any nearer than town. No one will come any nearer than that. In the night. In the dark.
