Harvard rejected my acceptance
Harvard decided to reject my application for a grade received over two years ago.

I failed Honors English II due to not completing my either my final exam or my final essay for the class. I was an immature teenager, only 16, and I have grown so much in the events in my life that have ensured. I am not the student that I was two years ago, and for them to use that to reject me is unfair.

If Harvard is suggesting that growth is impossible and that our past defines our future, then Harvard is an inherently hypocritical institution. Countless Harvard faculty have stressed the importance of failure for future growth and success. 

I hope society doesnâ€™t encourage this kind of judgement on the past. This is a sick reminder of where we stand as a people, and I hope you can side with me in encouraging a society of forgiveness rather than exile.
