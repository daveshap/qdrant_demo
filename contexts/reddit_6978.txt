Do you care about your job?
Or are you just doing something that can pay the bills?

I was laid off on Monday, part of the Barnes & Noble “we’re going out of business” layoffs. I loved my job. I was there for 10.5 years. I hated the company, have hated them for several years, but I loved my job. I cared about my job, not just in the work ethic sense but in a passionate way. Bookstores are important, even with the continued rise of the web and digital, it’s important to have physical bookstores. I could go on an on but that’s not what this post is about. That old phrase “turn your hobby into a job and you’ll never work a day in your life.”

I’ve casually looked at job boards, I’m not in a rush I have a severance through the end of April, I see a lot of openings that I’m well qualified for all of them making quite a bit more money than I did. I’ve known for years I could move and make more money. The problem is when I look at the jobs they are things I literally don’t care about. Sure I could easily get hired at Macy’s doing the same thing but I don’t care if someone buys a new shirt or not, for Best Buy I don’t care if anyone buys another TV just because a new model came out that is 4% better than the one they bought last year. I’ve looked outside of retail and am trying to figure out how to translate my skills (I’ll be making a different post about that) but again everything I see is for things I don’t care about. It feels like no matter what I do I will be doing something merely because I get a paycheck. I cared about selling books, I care about literacy, I care about expanding your mind by reading. 

Do you care about what you do, or is it just a paycheck?
