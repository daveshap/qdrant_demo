SPINAL: I wouldn't be doin' that, Snake.
HERSHE: We have a little arrangement. Anything happens to me, you're dead.
PLISSKEN: I'm already dead.
HERSHE: I see your point. What's the favor?
PLISSKEN: Get me to Cuervo Jones. Get me to the Kingdom. I got one hour.
HERSHE: Dream on, blue eye.
PLISSKEN: Say goodnight, Carjack.
HERSHE: Wait a minute. All right. Hold on.
SPINAL: Cuervo Jones has more firepower than two armies. No one gets near him.
