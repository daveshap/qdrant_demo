What happens if a employer posts a job that is not vacant
I applied to USPS and got a conditional job offer 2 months ago. Today I asked what was taking so long as I have still not started work. They responded that my position has not been vacated yet. They should said they will let me know when they will be moving forward. I guess I have never heard of someone posting a position that is not vacant. What happens if a employer posts a job that is not vacant?
