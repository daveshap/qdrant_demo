PETER: What?
KATHY: Have you noticed that every time we start to talk about something serious you start to play games.
PETER: I'm not playing a game now.
KATHY: Yes you are. You're playing word games.
PETER: What is this?
KATHY: I'm just trying to get to know you, Peter.
PETER: What? By attacking me?
KATHY: Nobody could attack you. You set your life up like one of your chessboards. You're impregnable -- but at the same time you've become trapped behind your own defenses. You're cut off from everyone around you.
PETER: What are you talking about? You don't even know me.
KATHY: Does anyone?
