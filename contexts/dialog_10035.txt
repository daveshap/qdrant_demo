SHEPARD: Who are you?
JOHN: I'm the train wreck you didn't see coming. And I'm gonna steal your life away. You went down 30 years ago. You just don't know it yet.
FRANK: You're telling me this maniac is a cop? What the hell am I supposed to do with that one?
JOHN: Call the FBI. Use a pay phone. Don't give 'em your name, Dad. Just tell 'em that it was Shepard who killed Finelli and Clark and the others. That he's the Nightingale.
