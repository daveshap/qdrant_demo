Who’s making 50K+ working from home? I NEED YOU.
Hi Redditors!

Okay, it’s official: I am completely fed up with my current job and I am ready to make the switch to working from home. 
I’m a 23F with 3 1/2 years of sales experiences. I have some college, but no degree or certifications. I currently make around 50K a year right now, and that’s the only reason why I stay. I honestly don’t know where to start looking or the best way to make this transition. 
If anyone here is living my dream, and making 50K+ from home I would love your advice and guidance on how I can be in the same position.  Hopefully the right person sees this, and can deliver me from my current job woes.
Thanks!
