Up to today, what characteristics do countries with effective COVID-19 containment strategies have versus those that have struggled?
This is obviously difficult to nail down completely empirically, as some countries like South Korea [did mass testing of the population](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/03/23/coronavirus-pandemic-south-korea-italy-mass-testing-covid19-will-keep-spreading/), finding many asymptomatic carriers of coronavirus. Many places may have had [people who had the disease](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/05/have-i-already-had-coronavirus-how-would-i-know) earlier but were never identified as positive. Also many countries have perhaps engaged in practices to avoid the stigma of high death counts. Previous cases of death from influenza and pneumonia are now [perhaps undiagnosed COVID-19](https://www.statnews.com/2020/04/04/cdc-launches-studies-to-get-more-precise-count-of-undetected-covid-19-cases/) cases.
And obviously, inequality plays a role in the numbers. Countries with low testing capacity will have low numbers of formally identified cases, but that does not mean low levels of COVID-19 cases and coronavirus characters.

But, to this point (rather than speculating about the future), what empirically has worked in reducing cases and deaths? New Zealand has [five million people and about a thousand cases](https://www.forbes.com/sites/erinspencer1/2020/04/10/new-zealands-pm-is-leading-a-masterclass-on-coronavirus-response/#5883ea865793), but deaths are in the single digits. Taiwan's response to coronavirus has been so competent that there are now [calls for it to join the WHO](https://www.yahoo.com/news/taiwans-coronavirus-success-bolsters-case-150420811.html), which like many international bodies it is not a member due to the ongoing One China dispute with Mainland China.  

The U.S, Italy, France, and Spain have all had huge issues keeping cases below the capacity of the healthcare system. According to [one projection of the US](https://covidactnow.org/), many states and counties are at risk of overwhelming hospitals within the next month or two, unless social distancing and stay at home measures are more rigorously enforced. Italy faced issues with an aging population and an abnormally high death rate.

A final factor is the issue of second waves and the return of the infection given that international travel will eventually begin to open again. Singapore, which isolated and avoided community transmission, [now has new clusters](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/09/world/asia/coronavirus-hong-kong-singapore-taiwan.html) due to travelers who were not identified as having the virus. That article also gives another opinion on Taiwan's efforts, showing the importance of looking at containment as something that takes months, rather than a few weeks. COVID-19 can take a while to kill after initial infection, with recovery taking weeks if not months. Here is an [excerpt from an NPR story on it](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/02/14/805289669/how-covid-19-kills-the-new-coronavirus-disease-can-take-a-deadly-turn):

> The most severe cases — about 6% of patients — end up in intensive care with multi-organ failure, respiratory failure and septic shock, according to a February report from the WHO. And many hospitalized patients require supplemental oxygen. In extreme cases, they need mechanical ventilation — including the use of a sophisticated technology known as ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation), which basically acts as the patient's lungs, adding oxygen to their blood and removing carbon dioxide. The technology "allows us to save more severe patients," Dr. Sylvie Briand, director of the WHO's pandemic and epidemic diseases department, said at a press conference In February.

> Many of the more serious cases have been in people who are middle-aged and elderly — Furuya notes that our immune system gets weaker as we age. She says for long-term smokers, it could be even worse because their airways and lungs are more vulnerable. People with other underlying medical conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes or chronic lung disease, have also proved most vulnerable. Furuya says those kinds of conditions can make it harder for the body to recover from infections.

> "Of course, you have outliers — people who are young and otherwise previously healthy who are dying," Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told NPR's 1A show. "But if you look at the vast majority of the people who have serious disease and who will ultimately die, they are in that group that are either elderly and/or have underlying conditions."
> 
> Estimates for the case fatality rate for COVID-19 vary depending on the country. But data from both China and Lombardy, Italy, show the fatality rate starts rising for people in their 60s. In Lombardy, for instance, the case fatality rate for those in their 60s is nearly 3 percent. It's nearly 10 percent for people in their 70s and more than 16 percent for those in their 80s.

So, what has worked, what has not?
