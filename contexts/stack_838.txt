Boot and log in without fallback to text console This is something I have noticed happening for a long time now, and I see it in various flavours of Ubuntu.  At the moment I happen to be using Ubuntu Studio.As the system boots past grub, you get a nice graphical Ubuntu Studio animated logo for a while, but then, just before the login screen appears, it drops back to the text console, where you see various things at different times (like system startup logging - as you'd see if you pressed escape while Plymouth is displaying the logo, and even a login prompt at times), but typically it at least shows the filesystem status (as clean usually), then it switches back to graphical mode for the login dialog.It would look very much neater if it didn't flash the text console on screen like this.  I am just wondering why it does this, and would like a fix?  I know it's no biggy.  I just get curious about odd things :)
