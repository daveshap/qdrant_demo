PEARL: You look mighty familiar to me. You sure you're not from around here?
PATRICK: I was born near here. But after my mother died, my dad moved. I grew up out in Rossmore Park.
PEARL: You're pretty black to be growing up in Rossmore Park.
CINNABAR: Guess it's not Rossmore Park. Thanks for the help.
PATRICK: Anytime. Be seeing you.
