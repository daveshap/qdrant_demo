An entire day of panic about my shoes...
Hi. So I should probably preface this with the fact I have anxiety and it's been super messing me up for a while. I'm sort of in a bad patch with it at the moment and so I can't stop obsessing over what happened yesterday. 

So I'm at the station waiting for the train when a random dude comes up to me and says, "having white shoelaces on Doc Martens is a neo-na zi thing, you know that?" I didn't, and so I said so, then I asked where the white on my shoes was because I didn't know there was any. Then he looks closer and says "Oh wait, never mind, they're yellow," because, ya know, that's what they are. Anyway since then I can't stop completely obsessing over what color my shoelaces are despite the fact I know they're black and yellow and they haven't magically changed colors overnight but now I'm extremely worried someone else is gonna see them wrong and think I'm some far right extremist, which I am 100% definitely not and I reject their horrible worldview entirely. I don't have the energy to be too nervous to wear my shoes but the whole incident has totally messed with my head just because some random dude can't see properly. I did some research and apparently yellow is anti-racist in some circles too. I just needed to ramble about this because it's super messed me up and like all my stress tics have come back and I hate it.
