I feel like a fuck up college at 24
I have been following all the "rules" my entire life and been barely getting by. I am in college at 24 and I just want to be done with school already. It is pointless to take these miserable classes just to get a stupid thing of paper that says I am in debt 45k and failed this many classes just to pass by the skin of my teeth again. I know that we all have to try in order to succeed in life but no matter how hard I try I always make it by a few points or in my college case I have no more room for failure in my degree so maybe this time I will fail. I just want all this to stop hurting my brain. I burnt myself out trying to get good grades and I never want to experience that again.
