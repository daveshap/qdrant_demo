BEN: I'm picking up Paul at the station - want to come?
WENDY: Nah.
BEN: What you been up to?
WENDY: Nothing.
BEN: So how's school treating you?
PAUL: All right.
BEN: Classes?
PAUL: Good.
BEN: Grades?
PAUL: Fine.
BEN: Anyone special? You know...
PAUL: Hnnn.
BEN: Well it's good to see you -- we miss you around the house and all, but this St. Peter's, it's top of the line, eh?
PAUL: Yeah.
BEN: You know Paul, I've been thinking, maybe this is as good a time as any to have a little talk, you know, about -- well --
PAUL: About?
BEN: Well, the whole gamut. Facts of life and all. Some fatherly advice, because, I tell you, there's things happening that you're probably old enough... well... For example, on the self-abuse front -- now this is important - it's not advisable to do it in the shower -- it wastes water and electricity and because we all expect you to be doing it there in any case -- and, um, not onto the linen, and not on your sister's underwear or any clothing belonging to your mother --
