JERRY: No no...
DOROTHY: Oh, tell the story.
WOMAN: Oh, tell the story.
JERRY: --so our first date, she told me about her favorite place in the world, the seven pools of Hana on the island of Maui...
WOMAN: Gorgeous.
JERRY: A year-and-a-half later, we were both in Hawaii for the Pro Bowl. Now I've always hit a wall at 18 months. Every serious girlfriend lasts 18 months. It's like --ka- boom. The curse of 18 months.
WOMAN: That's when you need to cement, and define define define.
JERRY: Exactly. And the world does not need another 35 year-old bachelor. I knew I wanted to propose, so I took her there.
WOMAN: To the pools?
JERRY: To the pools. Now she's Miss Rock Climber, and I'm more the Non-Rock Climber, but we're hiking up through the pools and there's a fine mist in the air, and I have the ring in my pocket, and I'm a little nervous, I'm lagging behind, and she says to me, get this -- Hurry up
WOMAN: Oh no -- _ 14.
JERRY: Well, it bothered me somewhat. And I got quiet. And now she's quiet and we're both pouting a little, you know. And I decide I'm not going to propose. The mood is not right. Why be impulsive? Now at this point I know she knows that I was going to propose and didn't. And she knows I know. So the entire sixty mile ride back to the airport, we don't speak. And we're both good at that. We fly to Honolulu in silence. We check into the Pro Bowl hotel --
WOMAN: How sad --
JERRY: But wait...
