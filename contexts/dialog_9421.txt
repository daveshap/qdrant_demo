BOSS MAN: Push and twist, it's child proof.
BELLE: Oh.
BOSS MAN: Gimme a couple dabs on the tongue.
BELLE: What is this?
BOSS MAN: Magic potion. You should try a little.
BELLE: Oh, no.
BOSS MAN: It'll calm your nerves. Works like a charm.
BELLE: Really?
BOSS MAN: Uh huh. Just put a dab on your tongue.
BELLE: Will I go crazy or something?
BOSS MAN: No, no, it calms you, makes everything nice and smooth. Just takes the edge off like a beer, but in a fraction of the time.
BELLE: Why not then?
BOSS MAN: Wait, before you do that, help me to the kitchen, I need to lay down. There's a cot back there.
BELLE: But --
BOSS MAN: It's much safer in there, sweety.
BELLE: Okay then.
