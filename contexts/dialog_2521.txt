PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN: Did you ever consider that some doors are locked for a reason?
MARTY: Nope. The way I figure it, doors are made to be opened. See you after school.
PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN: Oh -- Marty -- what time did you say it was?
MARTY: Eight thirty.
PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN: AM or PM?
MARTY: Pro, the sun's out!
PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN: Oh, right, right...
MARTY: Jeez, for a guy with a ton of clocks, you sure don't pay much attention to time.
