Are there any scholarships left to apply for?
So I may be jumping the gun on this as I do not yet have an admission decision, but hopefully this will help other people if not me.  I have my master's in psychology, and about a month ago my grad school announced that they are starting a PhD program in my same department, with the first cohort starting in September.  They need a "trial" cohort to go through the program in order to gain accreditation from American Psychological Association, and brochure says the program will be free to this trial cohort.  

So I apply, and I got an interview.  Interview went ok, I left feeling it could go either way.  Since my interview I have found out that the program would not be totally free- I'd have to pay for roughly 4 credits per semester at least until I get done with classes (could be as little as one year since I got my master's from same school in same department).  My estimates come to about $4k per semester including tuition, fees, and books.  I don't know how their partial funding would work when it comes time to do dissertation.  Also, if I get accepted and do this, they will have a program rule that students cannot work more than 20 hours per week at our everyday jobs.

If I were to get in, does anyone have ideas for how I could come up with the $4k by September?  I work full-time now so I could haul ass and work a ton until then, but free money is always preferable so that I can save a ton to help with living expenses should I do this.  I've started doing google searches but so far most scholarships are already being given out.  I'd look into assistantships but that would mean quitting my current job, and I'd rather keep that since it's in the psych field.  Loans are not an option- already $140k in debt from undergrad and master's and I am NOT adding to that.  

Thanks in advance for any/all advice!
