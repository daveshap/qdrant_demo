Difficulty finding a new job while working one.
Hi. Just wondering if anyone could share some tips/insights about staying motivated to search for a new job while working one?  I have to keep working to keep up my student loan payments.m but I'm really not into my field (Special Ed as a Paraeducator) and need to find something else that pays more. I find staying motivated to search for another job difficult as alot of my time and attention gets sapped up at work ( training to get a promotion) and I have a side buisness I'm trying to do. Just feels like my attention is constantly all over the place and it's hard to focus in on one thing. I'll find a job and start to apply and then just not finish the app often times. Anyway, just looking for guidance. I'm an open mind. I can't quit really unless I was to pay my loans by ridding my savings
