Average guys are screwed, the numbers are working against us. But there's hope--I think it's all about self-love.
 

I saw this on the showerthoughts reddit and it's absolutely true: "Tinder is the self esteem booster app for average looking woman and self esteem destroyer for average looking men". That's true not just about Tinder but online/offline dating in general. If you are a minority guy double worse--this isn't whining. It's reality backed by research (look up Dataclysm and Chris Rudder's research on OKCupid that was publicized on FiveThirtyEight, Time, etc) . Thing is it's what people *say*, and what they *actually do* are different. And that applies very much to dating too, especially as there will be exceptions that give advice based on their one special situation without acknowledging general trends OR they will fall into the "do as I say, not as I do" trap. 

Online dating is basically tall white guys or non-white guys with supermodel looks getting matching and meeting 80% of the women.

Now that said: That's the game. It's what attracts women initially fair enough, we're not entitled to any one specific person. People are attracted to what they are, so I don't begrudge women for being into tall white guys. Now this is not about women-hating, that's a dark place to go into. Biology and social norms/preferences are hard to overcome.

So I think we average, not super extroverted guys need to realize we have to approach this differently. My advice or 2 cents is to change the approach and just work on the basics:

\- **Gym** (because you'll look better AND it's good for you)

\- **Wear clothes that fit**

\- **Find one or two hobbies that you like, and go all in unapologetically**. It's easy to get insecure about your intersets--for example, I'm not into NFL or UFC at all. IDGAF about either, and it can make one seem meek when in the company of the boys chatting about it. But oh well.

\- **Be a little more social than your comfort leve**l. Just a little more. No need to become a hi-fiving woooo\~! bro at the bar. Just means maybe saying yes to more invites. Inviting someone you haven't before to do something social.

I think doing these four things can help us average guys just be more happy and comfortable with ourselves. Because being miserable or waffling in self-pity or having this resentment in us then becomes a reinforcing cycle. I think the problem is we compare ourselves too much, and also we set ourselves up to fail by playing a game that's not for us. Perhaps we should just optimize ourselves, and work at self-love, it might help our dating life.
