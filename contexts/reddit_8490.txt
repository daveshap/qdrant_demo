Does Bannon Need Senate Approval to Join the National Security Council?
We all are likely aware that President Trump signed an Executive Order [giving Steve Bannon a permanent spot on the National Security Council.](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/29/us/stephen-bannon-donald-trump-national-security-council.html).

 [According to a piece in the Palmer Report](http://www.palmerreport.com/opinion/trump-apparently-didnt-realize-steve-bannon-will-need-senate-confirmation-security-council/1282/) (I'm uncertain to its credibility), Bannon may now have to go through Senate approval because he doesn't meet the criteria of the five per-approved groups:

> According to section (a)(6) of federal statute 50 U.S. Code 3021, a civilian like Steve Bannon will in fact need to go through Senate confirmation and approval in order to serve on the National Security Council because he doesnâ€™t fit into any of the five listed pre-approved categories. That obscure law, which has remained obscure because no president has ever tried to put a political hack on the NSC until now, was dug up by MSNBC analyst Jonathan Alter late on Monday night. 

I looked up the law ([located here](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/3021)) and while it does specify the groups expected to be included I see no mention that falling outside of these pre-established roles subjects Bannon to Senate scrutiny. So, given other rules regarding Senate oversight does Bannon now need to have a confirmation hearing in front of the Senate?
