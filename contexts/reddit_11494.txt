I just ended my 5 year relationship/engagement
We'd been dating since high school and so much has happened since then and we just sort of, grew apart. On top of everything in my life being overly stressful with being broke and in debt and trying to go back to school. Living in different cities finally took it's toll. I know I made the right call in calling everything off and we're going to try and be friends and see where things go. It was just such a tough decision and I feel like no matter what I did, it was a lose/lose situation.
Now we have to tell our families that the wedding is off and we're over. So close to Christmas too. But I deserve to be happy and so does he, and it just wasn't happening anymore.
I hope everything will be ok.
I hope I made the right decision.
I hope. I hope. I hope.
