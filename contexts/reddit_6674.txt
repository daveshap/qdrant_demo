I got approached by a company owner to work for his insurance company.
I work at a corner store and I received a call during work, ok the phone I got told that he was a customer and said he liked the service I provided earlier to him (which was a big guess because I might have not served him since there's a lot of workers here) anyways. He wanted to know if I was searching for a iob and I said yes.

We went on call and he provided me all the informations I needed, answered everything I needed to know and we got along pretty well. We even went on an app for screen sharing and he showed me a PowerPoint to know exactly what my job was and what to expect.

I reach for contract no salaries, pay per contract, he suggested to start with family and friends which I do not like but I'd work on my own advertisement. Offer insurance and I have a large library to choose from since we have access to all sorts of company's insurance from everywhere in the US and Canada. You probably know the drill even since this is probably common.

I pay for my class which is official and provided by the government, I did not get all the information yet (asked him if we could wait on that). Classes totals up to 500$ and I'd know about everything insurance and terminologies and I need it!

Worth it? 

Is it worth it? I'm a good salesman
