FURTWÄNGLER: I made no deal!
STEVE: I don't buy that.
FURTWÄNGLER: It's the truth.
STEVE: I keep hearing you helped a lot of Jews to escape. How did you do that?
FURTWÄNGLER: I don't remember in detail, there were so many.
STEVE: Did you call someone you knew?
FURTWÄNGLER: I may have, as... as I said, I simply don't remember.
STEVE: Let me me help you, then. You picked up the phone and made a call - 'Hello, Adolf? Wilhelm speaking. Listen, old pal, there's a Jew-boy musician I want you to help. He needs a permit to get to Paris.'
STEVE: Or maybe you called Goebbels or Goering? You were so close you were in the same shithouse as them.
FURTWÄNGLER: May I ask a question?
STEVE: Sure.
FURTWÄNGLER: When will my case be heard by the Tribunal?
STEVE: Your guess is as good as mine.
FURTWÄNGLER: I need to work. I need to make my living. I live off the generosity of friends...
STEVE: Tough, tough!
FURTWÄNGLER: Then why is it, please, that another conductor who was actually a member of the Party, who used to play the Horst Wessel before his concerts, has already been cleared and is working again while I have to wait and wait and wait?
STEVE: I don't know, he wasn't my case. Why did you escape to Switzerland just before the war ended?
FURTWÄNGLER: It was because I learned that the Gestapo was about to arrest me.
STEVE: Why were they going to arrest you?
FURTWÄNGLER: I believe it was because of another letter I'd written to Goebbels lamenting the decline of musical standards due to racial policies.
STEVE: You didn't complain about the racial policies, just about the musical standards, is that right?
STEVE: So, how did you learn that the Gestapo was out to get you?
FURTWÄNGLER: During an enforced hour-long interval because of a power failure at a concert here in Berlin, Albert Speer, the Minister of Armaments, said to me, 'You look very tired Dr. Furtwängler, you should go abroad for a while.' I knew exactly what he meant.
STEVE: You sure knew a lot of people in high places.
FURTWÄNGLER: It would be truer to say, I think, that a lot of people in high places knew me.
STEVE: You were real close to all of them, to Adolf, to Hermann, to Joseph, to Baldur, and now Albert, So, let's hear the truth, let's come clean. What was your Party number?
FURTWÄNGLER: If you are going to bully me like this, Major, you had better do your homework. You obviously have no idea how impertinent and stupid your questions are.
