I graduate from my MS in December. Is a PhD right after a good idea?
Hi all. I’m currently a second-year MS in Biology (ecology-focused) student, and am interested in pursuing academia. However, I’m not dead set on this track, especially now that we are in the middle of a health and financial crisis.

As I graduate in December, I’m a little stuck on what to do. We all know academia is not the kindest field as is, so is trying to pursue it right after graduation a good idea? I understand how general this question is, but interested to hear from people that are in the same position or decided to pursue a PhD in 2008. Was having a TA/RA assignment a good thing? What market did you end up entering? How easy was the transition?
