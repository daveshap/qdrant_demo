LPT: Never "Post-Date" Rent Checks To Your Landlord
Like most renters, I use to mail out my rent check a few days before the first of the month to ensure the rent check got to my landlord before the due-date.

Landlords in my town are notoriously scummy, so I would make it a habit to "post-date" my rent check for the first of the month to ensure it wouldn't be cashed before it was due. I thought this would work. I thought I was "adulting."

But I was wrong. A few years ago: two days before the first, I got an alert on my phone that my checking account had been overdrawn with a negative -$647.12 balance. Panicked, I checked my bank account only to find that my landlord has already cashed my rent check. "That doesn't make sense," I told myself. "There's no way he could have cashed it before the first. I wrote the first of the month on the check. Somethings wrong."

So I called my bank's customer service number only to find out that my bank has honored the check and posted it to my account, overdrawing my account to the tune of a sweet $38 free. And trust me, back then, $38 was the difference between two weeks of cheap Top Ramen and two weeks of luxuriously baked spaghetti.

Contrary to popular belief, banks are under no legal obligation to the honor your request to postpone processing a check until the date written on a check. Even if you "post-date" a check for some date in the future, the payee can immediately cash the check upon receipt. Why? Once a check is signed, the check becomes legal tender and a bank can process the check at their discretion â€“ even if that includes disregarding a check's written date.

The bottom line: Never write a check you an amount you cannot cash when you sign your name. It is up to the individual recipient of the check to honor the date written on the check. While there is a long-standing tradition of post-dating checks, there is no legal requirements for banks or payees to honor your request to post payment to a later date.
