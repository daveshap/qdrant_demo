Had a strange email from a startup recruiter, is this legit?
Background - somewhat new software engineer/programmer, been actively looking for work, no industry experience.

A few days ago I got a LinkedIn message from someone looking for a software engineer. I asked him more about what his company did, and he gave this rambly, weirdly written messages with a lot of misspellings. The focus of the company was around two apps, built for a firm and it's client - and he told me two of the startup's potential clients are asking for the technology before January 8th. The recruiter also told me he had personally been trying to make part of the applications but this was too great a challenge for his experience, and that after those first two clients they would be searching for Series A funding. 

Something about this feels really off - like it's some sort of strange scam, or teetering on the edge of falling apart. Is this legit?
