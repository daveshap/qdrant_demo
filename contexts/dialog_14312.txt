MAX: Well, hello.
JACKIE: Surprise.
MAX: I walked right past you.
JACKIE: I know, ignoring me. What're you up to?
MAX: Catching a movie.
JACKIE: What'd ya see?
MAX: American President""
JACKIE: How was it?
MAX: Pretty good. Me and Annette Bening are goin steady.
JACKIE: Oh, are you? Does she know that?
MAX: No... ...I don't believe she's ever heard of me. But that doesn't mean we're not going steady.
ORDELL: What's up with this shit.
MAX: I think falling in live with movie stars is something that happens to a man as he gets older.
JACKIE: Does it happen to all men?
MAX: Well, I'd never be so bold as to speak for all men, but as or myself and a few of my friends, that's definitely the case. There's a lot of actresses out there you like, and there's some you have crushes on. But there's always one who you love. And with her it's sorta like going steady.
JACKIE: And Annette's it for you?
MAX: For now. These relationships never last too long.
