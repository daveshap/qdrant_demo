GREGORY: No. Stay that way. I want to talk to you. I love you -— you know that?
MARY: Yes.
GREGORY: Perhaps, later, when things are settled, when Jacqueline's well again -- maybe we can arrange things differently.
MARY: I've never loved any one before, Gregory, and I do love you -— you must know it -- but Jacqueline's my sister —— whom I had lost and have found again....
GREGORY: I know —— I shouldn't have told you—
MARY: No, I'm glad....at least I've heard you say it...
JASON: I hate people who try to peddle comfort. But,Mary, you shouldn't mourn for Jacqueline. Life for her was full of the agony of a disordered mind. It's better this way.
