What counts as an employment gap, and how damaging is it for a graduate?
Since graduating last year I've tried to get a job that's relevant to my degree sector and failed miserably. All I've managed was a temporary minimum wage job for two months that was nothing to do with my degree. I have some relevant volunteering from my time at university and a bit since I finished, but that's it.

Will it harm my prospects at degree relevant jobs if I've still not got a job in the sector a year after graduating? At what point do I just give up?
