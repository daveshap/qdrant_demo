THE CHIEF: Simple question, lieutenant. No reason not to answer. What is your father's name?
JORDAN: Dad.""
THE CHIEF: Any brothers? Sisters?
JORDAN: Dick, Jane, and Spot.
THE CHIEF: Are you hungry? What's your favorite food? We'll try to get it for you.
JORDAN: Green Eggs and Ham. You're not going to get anywhere. You might as well put me in the cage.
THE CHIEF: You are in the cage, O'Neil. Right here, right now.
JORDAN: Should I be afraid?
THE CHIEF: Right down to your worthless womb, and I'll tell you why. This is my island. My world. And here I can get away with shit that would get me arrested anywhere else in the world. Take another scan of my little joy- boy outside. If I can do that to a Navy Seal, what's gonna happen to you? Huh?
THE CHIEF: Why didn't you shoot the woman, O'Neil?
JORDAN: Wasn't deemed a threat.
THE CHIEF: She led us right to you. That's no threat?
THE CHIEF: Would you have shot if it was a man?
JORDAN: No. Yes. I mean, depends on --
THE CHIEF: The others already told me, O'Neil. They wanted to shoot, but you wouldn't let them. Because you went soft on another women --
JORDAN: That's not right.
THE CHIEF: That's what your crew said. Are they lying? Or are you?
JORDAN: I think you're the liar.
THE CHIEF: I'm not the one who got five good men thrown in a bamboo cage. You wear the bars, you made the call, and you got your whole crew --
JORDAN: We didn't know we were compromised. Firing would only've given away our position.
THE CHIEF: You think we should go easy on women, O'Neil?
THE CHIEF: Do you?
JORDAN: No.
THE CHIEF: I'm so glad we agree.
THE CHIEF: Didn't you know you'd be raped if you were captured? Didn't you even think about that?
JORDAN: Sure. Just like your men do.
THE CHIEF: I think we oughtta practice it, just so you know what to expect.
