ROB: Hi, Marie.
MARIE: Everything go alright?
ROB: She just wanted to pick up some stuff. No big thing. A relief, actually.
MARIE: God, I hate that time. That pick up stuff time. I just went through that before I came here. You know that song Patsy Cline Times Two" I play? That's about me and my ex dividing up our record collections."
ROB: It's a great song.
MARIE: Thank you.
ROB: Is that why you came to Chicago in the first place? Because of, you know, dividing up your record collection and stuff?
MARIE: Yup.
ROB: You share a place with T-Bone?
MARIE: No way! I'd cramp his style. And I wouldn't want to listen to all that stuff happening on the other side of the bedroom wall. I'm way to unattached for that.
ROB: I understand completely.
ROB: Awhile back, Dick and Barry and I agreed that what really matters is what you like, not what you are like...
MARIE: Yeah, but if you heard this band called the Crumblers, you'd --
ROB: What do you mean, the Crumblers? You know the Crumblers? Nobody's heard the Crumblers. Except me.
MARIE: Yeah, I know the Crumblers! I bought a used Blasters album in New York about ten years ago and somebody left a Crumblers single in it. My everything changed for a couple of weeks.
ROB: Books, records, films -- these things matter. Call me shallow but it's the damn truth, and by this measure I was having one of the best dates of my life.
ROB: Yeah, but you know what's his best film and nobody's even seen it?
MARIE: The Conformist.
ROB: Exactly! Fucking ex-actly!
MARIE: You haven't even seen it!
ROB: Nor have you!
