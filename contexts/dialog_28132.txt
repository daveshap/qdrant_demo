LOMBARD: Hot... These roads all round here, closed to the public... Why’s that? Military bases? Huh. I guess there’s space enough for war games... Must be good for business.
ATTENDANT: Must it?
LOMBARD: All those soldiers out there... getting bored, thirsty. Come out here for refreshment or female company perhaps?
ATTENDANT: Ain’t nobody out there, Mister.
LOMBARD: Nobody? Huh!... How come?
ATTENDANT: Maybe for the same reason that made someone somewhere not consider this a spot to build the Getty Museum...
LOMBARD: Ha-ha... Yeah... What about that road back there, though? It says ‘closed to the public’, doesn’t it?
ATTENDANT: You a tourist?
