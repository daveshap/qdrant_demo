Math Majors: Why did you go to grad school? Where are you now?
Recently accepted into a BS/MS program for math. Basically I get to start work on graduate courses before my undergrad is finished.

I don’t have any real conception on what the job market is like for math majors. I’ve heard good things about data science and cyber security and I think I would like to work on projects like that. But to be honest I would take just about any sort of math-related office job. 

What can I do with a master’s degree in math? What makes the master’s degree in math worth the time?
