Paranoid about layoffs - payroll looking at my LinkedIn profile, is this a bad sign?
I work for a company in the healthcare sector. We were acquired by a much larger company several years ago and now they are finally getting their vision together for what they are going to do with us.

&#x200B;

My company went from opening many new locations per year to none on the schedule for 2019. The change in direction has been communicated clearly to us. There have been rumors of a round of layoffs. 

&#x200B;

I work in data analysis. Unlike people in construction, real estate, etc (roles that are directly tied to our continued expansion), this role should not be affected by the change in direction. Two people recently were let go in the real estate wing of the company. 

&#x200B;

The thing that is now really bugging me: In the past week, a coordinator from payroll has looked **twice** at my LinkedIn profile. 

&#x200B;

Am I just seeing connections where they don't exist, or is this a bad sign? Why would payroll be looking at my profile?
