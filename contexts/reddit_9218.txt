I'm suicidal at this point
Hours cut due to covid same as wife's hours, no food, car troubles got worst, and family problems to top it off my mom is on her death bed I do not know a way out at all I'm trying to stay calm for my wife but inside I'm freaking out its putting a strain on our relationship I feel like if one more bad thing was to happen to us I would give up is how I'm feeling I dont think I could handle it just wanted to put this out somewhere love you guys stay safe.


UPDATE: talked with hr and was told I cant get partial unemployment because we are still working 40 hours use to work six days a week now to five that one extra day of work means alot. I was doing fine its crazy how one day can impact so much I've just had a really bad run with luck the last few weeks  and the comments and messages have really helped me out mentally talked to my wife she understands and now we are making a budget which we have never done I'm lucky to have her. I just want to say thank you to everyone here so much I was able to pay people back get food and get gas you guys have saved me literally.  also I have reached a hotline and set up a visit over the phone but nonetheless I got a therapist lined up low cost and first visit free. Thank you, everyone
