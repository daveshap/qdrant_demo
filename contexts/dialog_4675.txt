MARIE: I needed a break.
BOURNE: Where are we?
MARIE: We're about an hour away.
BOURNE: I can't believe I slept.
MARIE: You were tired. Here... For twenty-thousand I like to throw in breakfast. So what do you dream about?
BOURNE: I dream I'm asleep. I dream that I'm asleep and I can't wake up. I don't think I smoke.
MARIE: You ever think maybe you have a family?
BOURNE: I thought about it. I don't know.
