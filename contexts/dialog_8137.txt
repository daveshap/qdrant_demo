JACK: What's he doing here, Sid?
HUDGEONS: You tight with the D.A., trash?
JACK: Sure, he just tried to throw me off the force last Christmas as a little joke.
HUDGEONS: How'd you like a little payback? Not to mention a donation to the widows and orphans fund. Did you know Loew was a swish?
JACK: And Reynolds?
HUDGEONS: He's queer too. Metro paid him two grand a week to fake it with ingenues. On screen and off. I'm getting him to fuck the D.A. for a hundred bucks. That's twice the fifty you got for wrecking his career.
