FRANK: I know you're busy so I'll get right to it. Did you know her?
PETER: Only in passing. To say hello to.
ANDY: I've talked to a few people who say you and her were... friendly?
PETER: Chess tournaments can be boring sometimes. People have a lot of free time. They like to gossip.
FRANK: Could you tell me where you were last night?
PETER: Here. I played Gregory Lutz.
FRANK: I know. You won two games against him and left the auditorium at eight forty five. Where did you go after that?
PETER: To my room and then I went for a walk.
ANDY: By yourself?
PETER: Yes.
FRANK: This is a printout from the hotel computer for all the messages logged to your room. Here's one at 9:04 pm. It says: From Debi. Please call me at home.
PETER: She called to give me my schedule for tomorrow.
FRANK: What's interesting about it is you say you only knew her in passing. Yet, she says on her message for you to call her at home and she doesn't leave a number. That would imply you already knew the number.
PETER: I got it from the tournament directory.
