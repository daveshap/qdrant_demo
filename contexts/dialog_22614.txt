LEE: Hello.
CARTER: How you doin'?
LEE: My friend is on vacation, from America. I want to show him a good time.
HOSTESS: Oh, you American?
CARTER: That's right.
HOSTESS: You bring American money?
CARTER: Never leave home without it. Lee, this one's on me. You save your money.
HOSTESS: You get massage from Chinese girl before?
CARTER: No. It's my first time.
HOSTESS: You pick any girl for you and your friend.
CARTER: Any girl? Okay. Let's start with that one.
HOSTESS: Oh yes, she's very nice.
CARTER: She is nice. But I am very tense. I'm gonna need a lot of massages. I'll take that one, too. How you doin', baby? And...that one in pink. She can do my feet.
LEE: What are you doing?
CARTER: She said I could pick any girl I want.
LEE: Well, hurry up.
CARTER: Hey! You don't break in front of a black man in a buffet line.
