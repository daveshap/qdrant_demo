Has the war in Afghanistan been a success, a failure, or otherwise, and why?
Recent polling by Pew [suggests](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/10/05/after-17-years-of-war-in-afghanistan-more-say-u-s-has-failed-than-succeeded-in-achieving-its-goals/) that half of Americans consider the [17-year-old](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/afghan-war-now-longest-war-us-history/story?id=10849303) US-led coalition intervention in Afghanistan a failure, with only a third remaining optimistic. This has led some sources [to consider](https://nation.com.pk/02-Jul-2018/the-autonomy-of-us-failure-in-afghanistan) the intervention a failure of US foreign policy, or even [simply stating](https://www.weeklystandard.com/thomas-joscelyn/the-afghanistan-war-is-over-we-lost) "We lost". 

Credible claims that the US position in Afghanistan is not salvageable go back to [at least 2013](https://foreignpolicy.com/2013/03/15/the-real-reason-the-u-s-failed-in-afghanistan/), four years after the Obama "surge" [deployed](https://www.npr.org/2016/07/06/484979294/chart-how-the-u-s-troop-levels-in-afghanistan-have-changed-under-obama) an additional 30,000 troops to the country. 

By 2016, US troop numbers in Afghanistan were down to around 5,000-10,000, [down](https://www.npr.org/2016/07/06/484979294/chart-how-the-u-s-troop-levels-in-afghanistan-have-changed-under-obama) from nearly 100,000 at its peak in 2011. According to Pentagon estimates, the war has [cost](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/pentagon-says-afghan-war-costs-taxpayers-45-billion-per-year) an average of $45 billion a year, with some thirty thousand civilians [killed](https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/files/cow/imce/papers/2016/War%20in%20Afghanistan%20and%20Pakistan%20UPDATE_FINAL_corrected%20date.pdf) as of 2016. The US seems to have [officially shifted](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/15/world/asia/afghanistan-taliban-direct-negotiations.html) towards encouraging negotiations between the Afghan government and the Taliban, whose government was toppled in 2001. In 2017 the Trump administration [was considering](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-expected-to-announce-small-troop-increase-in-afghanistan-in-prime-time-address/2017/08/21/eb3a513e-868a-11e7-a94f-3139abce39f5_story.html) another troop surge, and as of late 2017 there were [about 15,000](https://www.militarytimes.com/flashpoints/2017/11/16/trump-surge-in-afghanistan-is-underway-as-14000-us-troops-are-now-in-afghanistan/) troops in the country. 

[Some commentators](https://www.heritage.org/middle-east/commentary/no-we-have-not-failed-afghanistan-heres-why-the-us-should-stay) have encouraged continued intervention, citing terrorism and security concerns.

**Have coalition operations in Afghanistan been a success? A failure? What contributed to the outcome?**

**Given what we know now, was the initial intervention justified?**

**Should the coalition have pulled out earlier?**

**Are negotiations with the Taliban the right way forward? Why or why not?**
