GUMP: Don't see why I can't ride, too! I'm second in command, damn it!
JACK: The colt's still too small.
GUMP: I'm small... and I can make myself smaller still... Small as a bee! Small as dust...! Want to see me do it?
JACK: We've no time for tricks this day, Honeythorn Gump.
GUMP: Tricks, is it? Why I'll trick ye! Ungrateful whelp! I'll sour your milk and bird droppings'll fall from the sky wherever ye walk.
JACK: Save your mischief for the Black Baron.
GUMP: Aye! That too.
JACK: You'll need more than bird droppings for Blackheart.
GUMP: I'll drop a cow on the knave!
JACK: Drop a mountain on him and we won't need our troops.
GUMP: Fine-looking army.
JACK: We march on Castle Couer de Noir within the hour.
GUMP: How do you plan on finding this here castle, if ye don't mind me asking?
JACK: A true and troubling question, Gump... We'll start from where the unicorn was killed. The Baron must have left a trail.
GUMP: Track the demon to his lair.
JACK: Aye. And hang his foul hide up like dirty laundry for the drying.
