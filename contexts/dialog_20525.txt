ROBINSON: An American nation. Colonel Lee, with your permission?
LEE: Please.
ROBINSON: Those of us who call ourselves Patriots are not seeking to give birth to an American nation, but to protect one that already exists. It was born a hundred-and-seventy years ago at Jamestown, Virginia and has grown stronger and more mature with every generation reared and with every crop sown and harvested. We are a nation and our rights as citizens of that nation are threatened by a tyrant three thousand miles away.
LEE: Thank you. Were I an orator, those are the exact words I would have spoken.
