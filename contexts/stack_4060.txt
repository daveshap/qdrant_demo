Schengen visa requirements (company letter and travel insurance) I would like to apply for a Schengen tourist visa, but I checked out Italy and I wonder about some of its requirements.Insurance requirement<blockquote>  The insurance must cover medical fees, hospitalization and repatriation costs up to 30,000 euros or SGD 50,000.</blockquote>Is the sum for all 3 or for each of them?Company letterDoes the letter need to mention all countries in my trip, or Italy only, or Europe?I hope I can find some enlightenment here.
