DICK VAN DYKE: Now Buddy, you're going on trial tomorrow. And if they find you guilty, you're gonna be stuck here forever. Well, not forever--lemme think ... Five year sentence ... Carry the three ... That comes out to ... sixteen and a half centuries, and that's rounding down.
DAVID: I'm going on trial tomorrow?
DICK VAN DYKE: This is TV pal. They don't fool around.
DAVID: There's worse places.
DICK VAN DYKE: Oh sure. For the first hundred years. Then it starts to get a little monotonous. Sleep well.
BOB: Bud Parker and William Johnson, you have been charged with desecration of a public building and the intentional use of prohibited paint colors in violation of the Pleasantville Code of Conduct and laws of common decency. Do you admit that on the night of May 1, you did consciously and willfully apply the following FORBIDDEN colors to the Pleasantville Town Hall: Red, Pink, Vermillion, Puce, Chartreuse, Umber, Blue, Aqua, Ox Blood, Green, Peach, Crimson, Yellow, Olive and Magenta.
DAVID: Um ... Yes I do. Where's our lawyer?
BOB: We prefer to keep these proceedings as pleasant" as possible. I don't think a lawyer will be necessary."
BOB: Do you further admit that this was done surreptitiously and under the cover of darkness?
DAVID: Well--it was dark out ...
BOB: Good. Do you further admit that this unnatural depiction occurred in full public view where it was accessible to, and in plain sight of, minor children?
DAVID: It was accessible to everyone.
BOB: Very well. Let the record show that the defendants have answered in the affirmative to all the charges.
