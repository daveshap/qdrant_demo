DAVID: The thing is, sir, I've just been giving the painting a very thorough inspection, with the help of Dr Bean here - and we feel the time's come for Whistler's Mum to have her first face-lift.
GRIERSON: Time taken its toll on the old girl, eh?
DAVID: Exactly. She's in a surprisingly terrible state. Isn't she, Bean?
BEAN: Oh yes.
DAVID: Whistler was a great painter, but he wasn't a great chooser of paints ....
GRIERSON: Thank you David. However, flattery will get you nowhere. Truth is, I have a rather different plan for Whistler's dear Mama. Bernie and I have been inspecting our books - and the long and short of it is, we cannot survive with our current losses, so ...
DAVID: ... you have to sack me. I understand, sir. I'll go quietly. In fact I'll go right now.
GRIERSON: No. no, no, hold on ... We cant sustain our loses - so I've decided.. to sell Whistler's Mother.
GRIERSON: Brilliant, huh? I already have a prospective buyer - the current Governor of California, no less, who is flies in tomorrow to inspect her and clinch the deal. Spread the news. I think decisive leadership has done the trick, don't you?
DAVID: Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Congratulations. Marvellous thing. Bravo.
