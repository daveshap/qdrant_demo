CARTER: You speak English!
LEE: A little.
CARTER: Bullshit a little. You lied to me.
LEE: I didn't say I didn't. You assumed I didn't.
CARTER: It's the same thing!
LEE: I am not responsible for your assumptions.
CARTER: You're full of shit. Do you understand what I'm saying to you? Full of shit?
LEE: Not being able to speak is not the same as not speaking. You seemed as if you liked to talk. I like to let people talk who like to talk. It makes it easier to find out how full of shit they are.
CARTER: Okay, fine, you're full a shit, I'm full a shit.
LEE: We are both full of shit.
CARTER: Yeah, that's right. Now that we understand each other... show me how you did that.
