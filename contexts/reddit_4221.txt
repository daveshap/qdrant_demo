Got rejected, feels good
Went up to this cute girl in my class this semester that I’ve been eyeing. We had a brief conversation, probably like our 5th conversation. At the end, I asked for us to go get food sometime and for her number. She hesitated and said we should go after class with a group of people. I took the hint, so I probably won’t ask again, but I feel good I got the courage to go up and ask, and in my opinion, that’s the important part.
