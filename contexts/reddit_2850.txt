What's the reasoning behind paying new hires significantly more than current employees?
So you've probably already heard about the saying "if you want significant pay rises, you need to switch jobs" which means companies. I understand that you as a company sometimes need to pay new hires more to be able to acquire them and I also get that you won't be giving out raises for current employees left and right to keep the costs in check when the incumbents aren't pushing and seem rather content with their pay. But what I don't get is: If an employee is performing well and communicates he's seriously dissatisfied with his/her salary, why would you let him leave and hire a new guy with lesser experience even though you have to pay him an above average salary to attract him and it will take months or even years until he's completely on board and knows all the processes. What's the benefit of that from a company's perspective?
