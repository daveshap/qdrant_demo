System freezes, apt-cache running 100% for an hour? Sorry if I'm overdoing the details. I'm new to the forum, that or I have another account I never knew about.I know the community prefers questions that can be answered, and I'm hoping I can get an answer, but this is turning out to be a mystery. I suspect my problem is being caused by apt-cache, but I'm at a loss for what may cause apt-cache to hang, so to put it short, apt-cache hanging and causing crashes is really my question. Details below if needed.Backstory: I have 18.04 LTS for desktop and gaming. For some while now, I've been investigating a freeze that happens semi-randomly. I notice if I let it run for a few days, it just locks up, sometimes even in half a day. The state that it ends up in is a completely broken state where nothing responds. USB, PS/2, Ethernet, audio is repeating if it was playing, the works. I did some overclocking in the past but this happens with stock settings and all of my hardware survives stress tests. I now stay at stock settings on my mobo until I can cure this problem.After thorough investigation and having no backups in a known-good state, I finally resorted to just letting it freeze and catching the screen with htop running. The offender seems to be apt-cache, as it used 100% of a CPU core and ran for over 58 minutes. Steam also used a whole core at the time but I expect that from Valve. What I don't expect is apt-cache running the policy command for an hour, so I think something's causing it to hang until the whole system locks. When I run the same command, however, it runs and quits just fine, and it only seems to hang like this in this random occurrence when it is run automatically. I would appreciate anything that can help in my investigation, as I'd prefer not to reformat and set everything back up if I don't have to.
