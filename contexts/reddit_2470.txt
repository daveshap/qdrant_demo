Remote work during COVID to permanent remote work?
I’ve been working from home during COVID and honestly it’s been great for me. Don’t get me wrong, I am so sad for how this virus has upended so many lives. But my company responded fast and told us to stay home starting in early March and since then I’ve had so much peace and contentment. 

Since working from home my professional and personal productivity has skyrocketed. I’ve been keeping up on work, starting a podcast, rebranding myself on social media, lost 20 lbs, read a few great books, used henna on my hair. With all of this good energy flowing, I’ve realized how draining it is for me to sit in an office all day. I enjoy my work but I’ve never liked being in an office all day long. It’s something that I dreaded earlier in my career and now I’ve just accepted it/gotten used to it. And I’ve tried to look for remote work before but couldn’t really find anything. 

This time has opened my eyes and I cannot go back to spending 40 in an office. I have no desire to do it. Prior to this covid crisis, the company reserved remote work for employees who had been w/the company 10+ years. It’s a family owned business and even one of the family members who had been there only a few years wasn’t allowed to work from home. But I’ve heard whispers that maybe they’ll see now that this is a possibility for us. I’ve been candid with my direct supervisor about wanting remote work. He wasn’t able to provide any information about where the company was at on the next reopening phase for us, but he seemed to understand. And I know many other colleagues feel like I do. 

My question is this:  is there anything I can do to move the needle on this? At this point it feels incredibly important for me to advocate for my needs. 

TLDR:  working from home has given me super productivity, peace and happiness and I need advice on how I can advocate for permanent remote work.
