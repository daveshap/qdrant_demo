PENDERGAST: What happened?
MARGO: I don't know.
PENDERGAST: I heard you calling and I ran after you, but you kept disappearing and I couldn't keep up.
MARGO: You were behind me? Running after me?
MARGO: It's okay, I'm all right. I remember now... It was an animal. Something large! I could smell it. It was hunting me. I saw two green eyes in the dark.
PENDERGAST: Where did you see it?
MARGO: Behind me. Over there.
MARGO: That's not what I saw.
PENDERGAST: All right. If you're positive.
