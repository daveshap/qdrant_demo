ED: You hadda show up on a weekend. This weekend. Wouldn't've even been a gun show ... for another month.
WILSON: Fucking out of order, that. Shouldn't be allowed.
ED: Now what. You gonna take your new arsenal, go visit Terry Valentine, just like that? Boom bam boom.
WILSON: It's only insurance. Can't be too careful. This Terry Valentine, he's probably a wonderful fella. They were together how long?
ED: Five years, I think. Long time.
WILSON: Well, there you are. Jen must've liked him.
ED: Jenny told me she met him at the beach. Got blinded by his smile. You believe that shit? Son of a bitch never smiled at me. Buried her at a private" service. Private for who. Him?"
WILSON: Hang about. I thought you said he come into the restaurant where you worked with Jenny.
ED: He came in with Jenny to the restaurant where I work. That's not where they met.
WILSON: And that's where you met Jenny.
ED: No, no -- Jenny used to work as a waitress. Before she met him. But that's not where she met me. Not in my restaurant.
WILSON: How'd the two of you hook up, then?
ED: Oh, Jenny was in my acting class.
