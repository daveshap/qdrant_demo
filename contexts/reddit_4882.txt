It's 4:37pm and I've been laying in bed all day crying
I can't seem to get up to do anything. I got up oncw to take a bath (which is my go to thing I do when I'm depressed) and once to eat food, which I had to talk myself into doing for 30 minutes. I just need help. Tips, tricks, anything really. I'm desperate. 

Edit: Thank you to everyone who helped me! It made me feel that I was less alone. I love this community!
