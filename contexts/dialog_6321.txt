MR. LEWIS: Attractive girl.
JAKE: Thank you. Actually, it's our first anniversary this weekend. She thinks I'm here to pick up something for my mother, but it's actually a gift for her. Think I've fooled her?
MR. LEWIS: Take it from me, you never do. But congratulations. Nice to be married, isn't it?
JAKE: Very much so.
