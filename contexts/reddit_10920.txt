I went out last night, and you won't believe what happened. It has to be a sign...
I'm not religious.  I don't believe in supernatural things.  But is this a sign?

Yesterday was terrible for me.  Every day is now.  The only thing I have that makes my life worth living - my girlfriend - is about to be gone.

I don't have any friends or a social circle (literally zero friends or family). I've been trying to go out at night - maybe I can meet another girl the way I met my girlfriend.  Maybe I can stay alive.

I got downtown and started walking over towards the bars. That's when I saw something approaching me.  It was a huge group of people, running with flashing lights and all wearing the same shirts.   It's like they were running a marathon.

I asked someone what was going on, and that's when I saw their shirt.  It said "one night.  One goal.  Stop suicide."

They explained to me that it was a charity run to raise money for suicide prevention.  Is this not just a sign of something?  This is the darkest period of my life, and I've been through some shit.  But last night, when I decided to go out instead of hyperventilate and cry in my apartment, that's what I came across.
