I found a full time job!!!
Its at a call center which I am not a fan of and I am hoping this job Im interviewing for on friday for a warehouse goes through but its a job none the less!!!  After four years of treatment Im finally getting off SSDI (Bipolar II), Medicaid, Medicare and food stamps!  I'm still poor but I will be a fully fledged productive member of society again! ðŸ˜€


Edit: Thanks to everyone for their kind words and updoots! :)
