KARA: What are you making:
ZALTAR: It's going to be a tree, I think.
KARA: What's a tree?
ZALTAR: It's something they have on Earth. You know, where your cousin went.
KARA: Where is Earth?
ZALTAR: Didn't you study six-dimensional geometry in school?
KARA: Yes, I know the equations---I just can't see it in my head.
ZALTAR: Even I have trouble with that sometimes. Earth is in outer space. And we're in inner space.
KARA: I don't understand.
ZALTAR: Wait till you're older. Here -- watch this.
