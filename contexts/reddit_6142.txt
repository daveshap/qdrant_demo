Back with previous employer after name change
After a couple years away and retraining, I've been hired back by a previous employer.

The issue is that I started using my middle name in the meantime. Any other jobs I introduced myself as MiddleName, however they know me by my first name. They contacted me to offer me the job on my old email, and given the current situation it's a great offer. At first I thought I'd cope with it, since for example my family refuses to budge, however I really dislike my first name (there's a reason I changed in the first place).

How do I have that conversation with management? How much reason do I need to give for the name change, or can I get away with "I'd appreciate if you made the effort to use my second name"? Knowing that for a part of the process I still used my old/first name.
