I had 10 rejections and 0 acceptances. Today, I got into Rice.
It's 4 am here and I'm on cloud fucking nine right now. I'm an international student who needed a near full ride to attend and I just got that. This community was really all that I ever had to guide me. Thank you everyone. Thank you. Thank you.
