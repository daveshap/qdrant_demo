LESTER: ... You can lose it all; you can lose it all no matter who you are... I don't know, what's the point of having it all. Look at me. I don't have a goddam thing... the market's terrible right now, went down ten points last week, goddam Lyndon Johnson!
GEORGE: Oh yeah...
LESTER: Yeah,, it goes up a little and then it goes down, maybe Nixon will do something. What's the difference, they're all a bunch of jerks. I wouldn't let 'em run my business, I can tell you that much. Not if I had any choice in the matter. I don't know what to do with you. I don't know, I don't know what's right or wrong anymore.
GEORGE: I don't either, Lester, I swear to you I don't.
LESTER: What about Jackie?
GEORGE: What about her?
LESTER: I mean, how did that happen?
GEORGE: Lester, it just happened.
LESTER: She's nothing but a whore.
GEORGE: No --
LESTER: Just a whore, I go over there, have a few drinks and get my gun off. I'm through with her, she's nothing but a whore.
GEORGE: No, man, no. You can say everybody's a whore. She's okay. I mean Jackie'll fuck around but not that much. Somewhere she really likes you, Lester, and it's not just the bread. She's okay.
LESTER: You really think so?
GEORGE: Yes I do.
LESTER: I'm finished with her.
LESTER: Oh, by the way, I think you oughta know -- Lorna thinks she's got the clap.
GEORGE: What?
LESTER: Yeah, the clap. That's what she thinks. But who knows -- I don't know.
