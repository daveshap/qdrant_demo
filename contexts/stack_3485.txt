How completely wipe information of overwritten files and folder? I have only a basic understanding of how files are written in a hard disk. Here I assume the files are overwritten this way.File A is deletedIts address is removed and showed vacantNew File B is overwritten above the space of File AI am assuming here that even though we are deleting File A and overwriting with File B, we can still recover File A with its residual information using powerful software or instruments.I have an idea to remove this residual information. Lets assume we have an imaginary hard disk with 10 GB space in which 5GB is filled with files and  the other 5GB is empty. Then we select all the 5GB files in the hard disk then Ctrl+X (cut) it and then Ctrl+V (paste) the same files in same hard disk. Performing this operation for n number of steps thus overwriting it again and again. Will this completely wipe the residual information?
