Can you get multiple values from a table into one row? I'm extremely green at database design and have been given a project to complete as part of an assignment.My question is, in regards to values from a table, in this instance, it relates to health club facilities.Let's say there are multiple facilities that a health club could have such as 24-hours gym, swimming pool, sauna, kids playroom, outdoor training park, cycle studio. My plan would be to store these and have a sequential ID number relating to each.If I store this information in one table, can multiple ID numbers be referenced in a single row in another?for example, if the health club \"Kingsway\" has 4 of those facilities, can I show in the row relating the \"Kingsway\" have under the facilities column ID numbers 1,2,5,6?Cheers
