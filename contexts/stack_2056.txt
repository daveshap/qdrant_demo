Confusion Regarding Naming of Operator Types I'm working on a program and need to separate operators into a class of unary and binary, but also into relational, arithmetic, logical, and bitwise.I'm struggling with the naming of these two types.What do I call relational, arithmetic, bitwise, and logical?I see that this relates to the function of an operator. Perhaps \"function type\"What do I call unary, and binary?I see that unary and binary relate to the amount of operands an operator can take. Perhaps \"operand type\"I'm not satisfied with just \"operator type\" because you can have a unary logical operator, and a binary relational one; it's not specific enough. They seem to specify different things about the operator and I can't exactly find the right word choice for this.Thank you!
