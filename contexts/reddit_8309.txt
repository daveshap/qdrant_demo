What is Roger Stone being accused of in the 1/25 OSC indictment? Does this relate to the Trump campaign?
The [Justice Department issued a 7 count indictment against Roger Stone](https://www.justice.gov/file/1124706/download) (PDF warning) this morning.

[Roger Stone](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/25/us/politics/roger-stone-trump-indictment-arrest.html) has been a longtime informal adviser of Trump, and participated in his 2016 election campaign.

The charges are part of the Special Council's investigation into communication between Wikileaks and the Trump campaign. 

> Roger J. Stone Jr., a longtime informal adviser to President Trump, was charged as part of the special counsel investigation over his communications with WikiLeaks, the organization behind the release of thousands of stolen Democratic emails during the 2016 campaign, in an indictment unsealed Friday.

I have a couple of questions:

1: What is Roger Stone being accused of in the indictment - for example, what false statements did he make?

2: How does this relate to his work on the Trump campaign, if at all?
