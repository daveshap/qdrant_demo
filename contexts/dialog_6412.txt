ELLIE: Dr. Cullers?
KENT: Kent, Kent for Chrissakes. You must be Eleanor.
ELLIE: Ellie. Pulsar?
KENT: 1919+21. Found a glitch in the timing; probably a starquake.
ELLIE: Nice. Where?
KENT: Here, right around Centaurus A.
ELLIE: This is how you see the sky?
KENT: It's how I hear it. The display's just a little something I programmed for astronomers with the misfortune of sight.
ELLIE: It's beautiful.
KENT: Never seen the optical sky myself, but I hear it's nice too.
