Picture a cup in the middle of the sea
I sit here with the realization that theoretically I have everything.. no, **more**, than I could ever want or need. A wife, family, job, money, safe home, cars, electronics, gadgets, so on and so forth.

Yet I feel I have nothing at all.

Day in & day out I'm surrounded by people, yet I feel like I'm trapped in a bubble. The world buzzes by & I'm not fully able to plug in, connect.

I'm just here. My life is passing by & as I reflect on it, it all seems so meaningless. I'm nothing more than a crude bit of matter who once never existed & who will someday never exist again. All of the accomplishments & possessions I've acquired will be both forgotten & meaningless 100 years from now. I'm sure my great-grandfather had one hell of a life, but I know nothing about it. Someday someone could say the same thing about me.

I've tried to find happiness, but it is so god damn elusive. Honorable things like charity & good works. Not so honorable things like drugs & women. Nothing provides clarity. Nothing provides any true meaning.

Therapy & meds have been of no help to me. Meditation is impossible. My mind is always racing, trying to figure it all out. I'm not sure what the fuck I'm doing here. Why are any of us here? This is all such a big fucking mystery & I'm getting tired of trying to figure it out.

So I'll just sit here, as I always do, and continue to let the world pass.
