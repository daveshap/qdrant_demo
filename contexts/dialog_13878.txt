WILL: What the hell do you know?
WALTER: Kay told me. She comes to me, you know. Tells me things. About you. About me.
WILL: I told you that was an accident!
WALTER: Then so was mine...
WILL: Don't you pull that shit with me.
WALTER: I didn't want to kill her, Will.
WILL: Couldn't get it up, Walter?
WALTER: It was when I went to kiss her. She started laughing. I got angry. After all I'd given her. All I'd shared with her. I just wanted to make her stop. That's all.
