Small victories help keep me motivated, what are some of your small financial victories?
Growing up (and even to present day) my family was never good with money.  I had to learn, sometimes the hard way, how to manage my money.  Some months its harder than others, and I try to stay focused and I really rely on small victories to help me keep that motivation. My most recent small victories include not going below $100 in my checking account. I have alerts on my bank account and it will tell me when my balance drops. I have kept it above the $100 for the last 2 months!

My next small victory is kinda silly. Last year I went to a cook out and sat on the most insanely comfortable zero gravity outside chair. I was dying to have one.  They were so dang expensive (hoovering around $150ish for good quality ones).  In an effort to save $$$ this summer, I wanted to transform my backyard into a place that is relaxing and fun, so I will be more inclined to stay home instead of wanting to go out.  Well, as it happens, I was doing  my shopping at a local store and I found the exact chairs I have been pining after! They were listed for $99. It seemed like a lot, but was even cheaper than the ones i've been hanging onto online. I asked the salesman some questions about them and he told me to wait one more day, they were going on sale for 40% off! So the next day I ran to the store and got two! I never thought a chair could make me so happy LOL.

The victories are small, and meaningless to most, but it keeps me motivated to continue on with improving my financial situation. What are some of your most recent small victories?
