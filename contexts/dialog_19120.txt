GREEN: Oh, honey, I didn't mean to scare you.
BARBARA JEAN: How did you come in here?
GREEN: Well, my wife, Ester's down the hall. I saw Barnett leaving and I was just talking to Ester about your being here.	She loves you so much, I just had to come down and say hello. We've been following you since you were a girl. Well, I just scared you to death. I didn't mean to do that.
BARBARA JEAN: Well, I guess you caught me at a weak moment.
GREEN: You'll have to speak up.
BARBARA JEAN: I said, I've been real tired.
GREEN: Eater says she doesn't see how you do it.
BARBARA JEAN: What's wrong with her.
GREEN: Oh just about everything, I guess. Those doctors started on an overhaul and don't want to quit. They keep taking things out. She's going to come home an egg shell. Tough, though.. She's tough.
BARBARA JEAN: What did you say your name was?
GREEN: Green.
NURSE: Well, Mr. Green.
GREEN: Hi, Sherry.
NURSE: How'd you get in here.
BARBARA JEAN: It's fine. We were just talking about Vitamin S.
GREEN: I'll go on. Ester'1l be very glad.
BARBARA JEAN: You remember what I said about the Vitamins.
