WAYNE: Jesus. What kind of FBI agent are you?
AGENT HADLEY: I'm your worst fuckin' nightmare. Now, if you don't want me to keep on hurting you, it's important that I believe you and right now I don't. So tell me, where did they go?
WAYNE: I swear man, I don't know. They packed up and left a half hour ago. All I got is one of their phone numbers in Paris.
