BOURNE: Why are you here, then?
NICKY: Please -- I'm only here because of Paris -- because they can't figure out what you're doing -- I'm here because of Abbott --
BOURNE: Abbott?
NICKY: He closed down Treadstone -- he took care of me after Paris...
BOURNE: So when was I here?
NICKY: What do you mean?
BOURNE: For Treadstone. In Berlin. You know my file. I did a job here. When?
NICKY: No. You never worked Berlin.
BOURNE: My first job.
NICKY: Your first assignment was Geneva.
BOURNE: That's a lie!
NICKY: You never worked Berlin...
NICKY: No... Jason... please...
BOURNE: I was here!
NICKY: ...it's not in the file... I swear... I know your file... your first job was Geneva!... I swear to God you never worked here!...
