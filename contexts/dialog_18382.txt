DIZ: Getting on to dinner, isn't it, pal?
SAUNDERS: I give that Trail Blazer five more minutes to show up-- --*five more minutes*!
SAUNDERS: Well--who d'you take this time--Paine, Bill, Carl--or McGann?
DIZ: Hey--you're into me for a buck already. I say--McGann. Shoot the whole dollar.
SAUNDERS: Okay. For the dollar, I give you McGann *and* Bill and Carl. I got Paine. Hello... Oh, yes.
SAUNDERS: No, not yet, Senator Paine--not hide nor hair of the man. You mean to say the boys haven't--?
DIZ: Eight to five Little Boy Blue is plastered.
SAUNDERS: Well, why don't they try the police-- get some blood hounds--or Indian guides--
