How do you choose the right way to frame the story of your paper?
In my field of research, there are usually many different ways to tell the story of your experimental findings, which ends up moving the work in a direction where you do even more experiments in an attempt to validate your conclusions, and so on. I think of it as an intersection in my project, and depending on the turn I make next, the whole story gets a different shape. Additionally, every conference venue has its own flavor, so to say: some prefer theoretical rather than applied work, some are skeptical of new tasks while others are receptive. How do you decide which direction to go with your paper, and how to frame your research story?
