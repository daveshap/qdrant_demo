MCCLUSKY: Susanville, Soledade.
SCAGNETTI: They've killed a shitload of inmates and guards---
MCCLUSKY: Five inmates, eight guards and one psychiatrist all in one year's time... Very good. You do keep up with the headlines.
MCCLUSKY: Look, our situation in a nutshell is, no prison wants 'em, no prison will take 'em. I'm even talkin' hellholes, where the warden's as hard as a bar of iron. No one wants those fuckin' assholes behind their walls, dealin' with 'em day in, day out.
SCAGNETTI: I can appreciate that.
MCCLUSKY: So can we. So the solution to our little problem is we had them deemed crazy. And we're shippin' 'em to Nystrom Asylum for the criminally insane.
SCAGNETTI: Lobotomy Bay?
MCCLUSKY: You've heard of it?
SCAGNETTI: So, how do I fit into this scheme?
MCCLUSKY: The public loves you Jack...You don't mind if I call you Jack, do you?
SCAGNETTI: By all means.
MCCLUSKY: You're a celebrated cop. Twenty-six years on the force, a best-seller out on paperback...
