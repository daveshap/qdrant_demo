Strange Request for Ideas
Hi Everyone!

I'm looking for ideas of interesting/unique things to bring into our student center. Previously, we've brought a Coke Happiness machine to the building, and this past spring we had an alligator petting zoo (being Louisiana and everything). Does anyone have ideas for unique/strange/fun things that they've seen brought into a student center for maybe a day or two? Any idea is welcome; the crazier the better.
