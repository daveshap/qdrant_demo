Queen bee glitch So, I was digging underground when my screen said, \"The queen bee has awoken!\"I was away from my house, so I teleported back using a magic mirror. Soon the boss music started at my house, And I ran away. (My house is not at an jungle.) But she followed me! I died on purpose to get her to despawn, but she was still there! What Do I do?
