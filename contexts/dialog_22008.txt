KITTLE: Take her down to the car, and for Christ's sake be careful this time. Last suspect he took in, butter-fingers dropped her down the stairs. What a mess. Why is it we don't appreciate our arms and legs till we've lost the use of them?
ADAM: Hey, listen... I'll give you something else, Kittle. Anything. Remember... remember that corpse washed up on Huntington Beach? It was never identified...
KITTLE: Who cares?
ADAM: Alright, wait... there's a dentist in Brentwood peddling morphine...
KITTLE: Careful she doesn't hit her head on the way.
ADAM: Come on, don't you screw with her, please! You... you got to want this: armored car job. CalTrust Bank. They took two million in cash...
KITTLE: Read my lips: Zimmermann or nothing.
