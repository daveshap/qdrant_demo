CORBETT: Still quite a hike to Devil's Cauldron. Days. A long stretch to go without sleep, my friend. You can hide behind that pistol for now, but take your eyes off me long enough to sneeze --
ERIC: -- Turn around.
CORBETT: Ice is too thin -- you can see the water moving underneath.
ERIC: We're not sitting here 'til November. There's a cargo plane coming to Devil's Cauldron in four days, and I'm putting you on it.
CORBETT: We get wet, we freeze to death in a couple hours.
ERIC: I've been on ice like this when I was a kid, skating. Spread your weight, keep moving. Go on.
CORBETT: Be my guest.
ERIC: I'm right behind you.

CORBETT: Wait 'til I'm across!
CORBETT: Most dangerous thing in the world: A regular Joe, in over his head. You trying to prove how tough you are for me, or for yourself?
ERIC: It wasn't my idea to crash the plane.
CORBETT: Let's camp. There's grayling under this ice. I'll snare some for dinner.
ERIC: We've got another two hours of daylight.
CORBETT: Pushing it is flat wrong. All you prove is your ignorance about breaking trail.
