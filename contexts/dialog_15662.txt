JACK: Hank. The little cannon you brought, get it. Guard the shoreline. Otherwise, we're done. We made the I.D., our job is finished.
KEOUGH: Alright, Ms. Paleontologist. I wanna know why that monster is here. You got a theory?

HECTOR: Maybe he doesn't play well with others.
KEOUGH: Is everything a big fucking joke to you?
HECTOR: <u>Bite</u> <u>my</u> <u>bishop</u>.
