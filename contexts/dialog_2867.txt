HARDY: Stay where you are.
STYLES: Or what? You've gone round the bend --
HARDY: West had a partner. Someone who knew how to get things done.
HARDY: What I can't understand is why you signed these. If you'd just let West take care of the paperwork, no one would have known, but you got careless. So when Pike finally told the truth you had to get rid of him, too.
STYLES: That's preposterous --
HARDY: Toxicology report came back. Kendall's attack was caused by a drug known as anephadrine, maybe you've heard of it. It's for asthmatics. If an epileptic takes enough, it kills them. I checked with the nurses at the hospital -- you're the only other person who visited Kendall.
STYLES: I wanted to see if he was okay --
HARDY: You poisoned him, Bill. You heard our interrogation, you knew he was ready to crack, so you killed him, just like Pike.
STYLES: I'm not even going to dignify that --
HARDY: No! You will stand there and you will listen! What happened to you, Bill? You were the one who joined up to do good in the world. You were the one who believed in it --
STYLES: You want to get into a finger pointing contest about character? The army kicked you out for drugs, the cops fired you for taking bribes from a mobster, and you think you can stand there and lecture me on codes of conduct? There's only one criminal standing in this room and it's you.
HARDY: Not for long.
HARDY: No more witnesses. West's a ghost. But it doesn't matter because we have your signature, the hospital log, and Kendall's toxicology report. And that'll be enough.
STYLES: You're crazy --
HARDY: You can't duck this, Bill. I may have done every goddamn thing in my life wrong but I won't let this happen.
STYLES: For the last time, I have no idea what you're talking about --
HARDY: Get your hands away from the desk!
