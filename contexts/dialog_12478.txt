TREVOR: What happens if I'm convicted of Kirsty's murder?
LARRY: Well they'd have to prove it in a court of law for one thing-
TREVOR: Please Larry. Pretend you like me and humor me.
LARRY: Seeing you were her sole benefactor, and I'm the executive of the will, Kirsty's entire estate would have to be donated to the city.
TREVOR: Hello? City? Cops? It's a fucking conspiracy!
LARRY: Pardon my glibness Trevor but you sound like a raving lunatic. The next time you seek counsel it should be of the psychiatric type. You're obviously on the verge of some nervous collapse.
TREVOR: Thanks for your concern Larry. And fuck you too.
