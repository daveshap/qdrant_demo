Can i restore a back up of the user folder to a fresh install without issues? Can i restore a back up of the user folder to a fresh install without issues?I created the back up with the disk utility toolI am fresh installing an iMac late 2015 because it's very slow.I have backed up the /users/ folder and the /library/ folder.I have a second question:Is this a good way to handle this? Or is there any better way?Would i be able to restore the users folder with time machine without bringing other applications etc?
