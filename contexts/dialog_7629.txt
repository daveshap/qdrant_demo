ROSE: He can't, Samantha. He's been suspended from after-school activities. Donnie... are you still with us? How was your therapy session tonight?
DONNIE: Fine. You know, Dr. Thurman isn't so bad a lady. I can tell her anything.
DONNIE: So, we call them... IMGs.
GRETCHEN: Infant Memory Generators.
DONNIE: Yeah. So the idea is that... you buy these glasses for your infant, and they wear them at night when they sleep.
GRETCHEN: And inside these glasses are these slide photographs. And each photograph is of something peaceful... or beautiful. Whatever pictures the parent wants to put inside.
DR. MONNITOFF: What effect do you think this would have on an infant?
DONNIE: Well... the thing is, nobody remembers their infancy. And anyone who says they do is lying. We think that this would help develop memory earlier in life.
DR. MONNITOFF: Did you stop and think that maybe infants need darkness? That darkness is part of their natural development.
