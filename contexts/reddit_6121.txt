have been called back in to work but precautions sound sketch
so my office closed last week due to this virus and late last week my supervisor sent out an email saying that we are considered essential. i work at a tms center and its a newtreatment for  depression that involves send magnetic waves into the brain to activate neurons. the week before we closed we had a lot of patients cancelling or missing.   


when we closed i thought it would last until this whole thing blows over but i just got a text saying i am on the schedule for tomorrow. i asked about what protections we will have and she said just cloth masks and gloves. i then asked her about the N95 masks that are recommended for healthcare workers and she said she has been unable to order them. Only reason I am really worried is because i have my dad who has a compromised immune system at home and don't want to drag it back to him.  


I really love my job and don't want to quit. i also know that quitting my job at this time would be extremely short sighted and foolish. however i do feel like my health and the health of my family is super important. what would be the best way about portraying this to my employer?
