CARLA: Where'd you get this?
DANNY: I stole it. From a synagogue.
CARLA: How come there's no punctuation?
DANNY: That was a later invention, it's not in the scrolls.... Anyway, the Jews know where the sentences end. They know the whole thing by heart. Every word. Every letter.
CARLA: Do you know it like that? By heart.
DANNY: No.
CARLA: But you can read it, the Hebrew.... Right?
DANNY: What do you care?
CARLA: 'Cause I want to know.... What is this word? This one here...
DANNY: Va-yomer... And he said. It goes the other way.
CARLA: Oh, yeah...
DANNY: Va-yomer adonai el Avram: lech lecha mayartzcha oo-mimohlad-tcha oo-m'bayt avaycha el ha-ertez asher arecha...
CARLA: What's it mean?
DANNY: And God said to Avram, take yourself away from your land and from the place you were born and from your father's house into the land -- a different land -- and I will show you....
CARLA: I want to learn to read it.
DANNY: Why?
CARLA: Know your enemy.... 'Cause it's a basic text of Western culture. I want to read it in the original. Okay?
DANNY: Hebrew's very difficult. It would take years.
CARLA: I'm good at languages.
DANNY: Put something on. You're not supposed to be naked in front of it.
CARLA: Why not?
DANNY: They think it's the word of God, and it's holy, and the flesh isn't....
CARLA: That's stupid.
DANNY: Yeah, it's stupid. Put it on, or I won't teach you.
DANNY: See, the Jews love to separate things: the holy from the profane, milk from meat, wool from linen, the Sabbath from the week, the Jew from the gentile.... As if one little scrap of this was going to completely contaminate that.
CARLA: What assholes.
DANNY: You can't curse in front of it either.
CARLA: Who gets contaminated, the Jews or the gentiles?
DANNY: Good question. Both. Aleph...
CARLA: It looks a little like a swastika.
DANNY: It's silent. It holds a place, takes a vowel. The vowels are little dots that go under the letters.
CARLA: Where are they?
DANNY: They don't put them in the Torah. I'll get you a chumash, they'll have them there...Bet...Gimel...Dalid...Hay... How come you're here instead of with Curtis? Besides the Hebrew lessons...
CARLA: The sex is better.
DANNY: Even though his dick is so big?
CARLA: With you there's a tragic dimension.
DANNY: Vuv...Zayin...Chet...Tet...
KYLE: This will be a different kind of device.
DANNY: That damn thing. You know how it made me look...?
KYLE: I'm sorry, Danny. It won't happen again. I'm going to use a brand-new power cell. Plus we'll have a back-up timer.
DANNY: I've gotta kill some Jews, Kyle. I'm serious. I'm always talking about it. This time it's gotta happen.
KYLE: It will.
DANNY: What about Drake, did he ever show up?
KYLE: No, it's weird, man. Nobody knows where he went.
