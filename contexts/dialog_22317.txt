VALIANT: Come on, lady, haven't you ever seen a mole before?
JESSICA RABBIT: Toons aren't given imperfections.
VALIANT: No? I guess we're not counting lying, stealing and murder.
JESSICA RABBIT: You've got the wrong idea about me. I'a a pawn in this just like poor Roger. Can you help me find him? I'll pay you anything.
VALIANT: Yeah, I'll bet you would. You gotta have the rabbit to make the scam work.
JESSICA RABBIT: No, no, no... I love my husband.
VALIANT: Oh, sure. I can just feature you standin' outside your little hutch, holdin' a carrot cake waitin' for hubby to come home.
JESSICA RABBIT: Oh, please don't make fun of me, Mr, Valiant. You don't know how hard it is being a woman looking the way I do.
VALIANT: Yeah, well, you don't know how hard it is bein' a man looking at a woman looking the way you do.
JESSICA RABBIT: I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way.
VALIANT: I'm not complainin'. But give me credit. I'm the guy who took the pictures of you and Acme playin' pattycake, remember?
