ANDERTON: Just so you know, I've overridden the vehicle locator. I just wanted to talk to you before Justice --
BURGESS: Justice already knows. Talk to me, John. Tell me what's happening?
ANDERTON: This is all Witwer. He's setting me up.
BURGESS: Stop. Just wait. Who's the victim?
ANDERTON: Somebody named Leo Crow.
BURGESS: And who the hell is that?
ANDERTON: I have no idea. I've never heard of him. But I'm supposed to kill him in less than thirty-six hours.
BURGESS: All right, John, just take a breath, let's think about this...
ANDERTON: I'm out of breath! I'm a fucking fugitive!
BURGESS: Then come to my house. We'll talk --
ANDERTON: I can't. They're following me right now. They'll meet me there. They'll halo me.
BURGESS: How could Witwer have accessed the case file?
ANDERTON: Can you fake the cerebral output?
BURGESS: We're years from that. John, I'm asking you: please, come in, we'll shut down the system until we get this thing figured out.
ANDERTON: You know I can't do that. You can't do that... Lamar, I need you to talk to Wally, see if Witwer's gone inside the temple again. Then ask Jad for any off hour EYEdents into the analytical room --
BURGESS: John. Just tell me, who's Leo Crow?
