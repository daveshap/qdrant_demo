Can a Slaver Disintegrator destroy a General Products Hull? The books say that the hull is indestructible (except to Antimatter) and that it is immune to all known weapons.But the books also say that the hull is a molecule, and that the Slaver Disintegrator disrupts the field that holds electrons to the nucleus. So it seems that the Disintegrator would be able to destroy the hull.
