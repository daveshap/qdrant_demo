Overthinking is killing me
I have always been shy, and was recently diagnosed with severe social anxiety. I have also been depressed for about 3 years now, after I had been bullied by some " friends " in middle school, 7th grade. 8th grade was even worse, I had lost all my friends, and had turned into a loner. My freshman year was the same, and the teachers even started to pick on me. That's when I left, and decided to stay at home and do online school. Both of my parents are hard working, so they couldn't stay home with me, so I had absolutely no motivation at all to work on school, and barely passed. I am now a Sophomore and only have online friends. I overthink EVERYTHING to the point where I can't even text my friends online anymore, because I worry I will say something weird. It has never gotten this bad, I used to be funny, and I didn't overthink as much. I was almost outgoing. I don't know what to do. I've tried talking to a few therapists before, but it has never helped and i am not sure about any medications. It is really hard for me to post this, but I need some help.
