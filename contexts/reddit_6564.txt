The company I work for is being sold (with potential buyers), what should I do?
Background: I have been working for this company for 1.5 years as a production planner. It has been a family owned company for 80 years (since the 1940s). Unfortunately, the owners have had health problems (stroke and mental problems). We are a profitable company that supplies a niche apparel product. We are still gaining new customers, creating new designs, and etc. We have several patents. We own two manufacturing plants in Central America. I work in the stateside distribution center (located here for 30 years).

Today we had a meeting with this information provided. The company have four potential buyers. They are optimistic about them. They have been trying to sell for years but the owners were only interested in investors not a large competitor buying. All four companies interested are smaller than ours. Two are in the same apparel as ours. One sells a product that is a direct competitor. Some have distribution centers, some have manufacturing plants but in Asia.

Management seemed positive but management is also older and closer to retirement. They are also less expendable. They said a lot of stuff (they have always presented the company as a whole, this will help the company grow, the companies interested are "good people", etc) but it is hard to tell if it is just corporate speak or not. They are in the "due diligence" part of the sell.

I have a Bachelor's but it is in Special Education. The town I am living in is **very** small and in the Midwest. I bought a house last year and am going to be paying that off for the next 20 years. I am a naturally pessimistic person so this is stressing me out.

**tl:dr** My company is being sold, what should I do to prepare?
