I need to find my first job! Could anyone please help me by giving some advice on how to?
I just finished school and moved all the way from Bolivia (South America) to Brussels. Since I have to wait until September to begin college, I need to get a simple/first-timer job to gain some experience and money to help out my dad. If anyone could give me some advice on how to look for the kinds of jobs I can get that would be really really great!
