LOTHER: Anya, I think you're crazy.
ANYA: Any woman's crazy to feel about a man the way I do about you.
LOTHER: I wasn't running out on you. When I got over there-- made my plans--I'd have sent for you.
ANYA: Then why the sudden exit without even telling me?
LOTHER: Do you want the truth, Anya?
ANYA: It would be a nice change from you.
LOTHER: I had an idea your husband was getting suspicious.
ANYA: You're a charming liar. You <U>know</U>, Herbert's too dull to be suspicious about anything--even when I suddenly decided to come to Europe at a few hours' notice--
LOTHER: How'd you ever get away with it?
ANYA: When I found out you were going I just had an attack of nerves--a few tears--and Herbert was on his way downtown to get my passport ... so who cares ... I'm here with you ... and that's all that matters to me.
LOTHER: Sure!
ANYA: I never want to go back....
ANYA: Here's to Europe! Couldn't try to look a little less glum, could you?
LOTHER: Don't be crazy--I'm tickled to death to see you.
ANYA: That's fine--because you're going to see a lot of me ... for the rest of your life.
