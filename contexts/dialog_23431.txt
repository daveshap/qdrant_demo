JOHN: That's the first thing that ran through my mind when I saw you. I thought this is not the same man that rode the unicycle naked through the homecoming parade.
ANN: You did that?
GRAHAM: Everybody has a past.
JOHN: What do you think the Greeks would make of that outfit you're wearing?
GRAHAM: A bonfire, probably.
GRAHAM: This food is excellent.
ANN: Thank you.
JOHN: Yeah, it's not bad. Usually Ann has some serious salt action going. I keep telling her, you can always add more if you want, but you can't take it out.
GRAHAM: You have family here also?
ANN: Mother, father, sister.
GRAHAM: Sister older or younger?
ANN: Younger.
