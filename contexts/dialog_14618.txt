KATHRYN: How the hell did it get in here?
MIKE: God, they're horrible. I hate them. Did you see its eyes? How black they are? The look in them?
KATHRYN: Don't think about it. It's over.
MIKE: It's never over... Here comes another six years of bad dreams.
CALVIN: What you're saying is we have a Great White shark in the lagoon.
MIKE: And a missing man.
PHILIP: Unhappy combination. Most likely one's inside the other.
KATHRYN: Sharks are man-biters, Mister Hutton. Not man-eaters --
PHILIP: That's a load of codswopple. A Great White doesn't fear man. It doesn't fear beast. It's an orgy of food and blood.
KATHRYN: I think we can capture it. I'd like to try.
PHILIP: That's preposterous!
CALVIN: Go on, Doctor.
KATHRYN: No one's ever caught a Great White except indirectly in fishing nets. I want to dart it and keep it alive.
CALVIN: It would make a marvelous attraction; the only Great White in captivity.
KATHRYN: I can get it.
PHILIP: You can get killed!
KATHRYN: I've handled sharks before. Bigger than this one.
PHILIP: Calvin, let me go down there and kill the bastard.
KATHRYN: No!
PHILIP: It'll chop up half a million dollars of your tropical fish in two minutes.
KATHRYN: Calvin, I insist I be allowed to capture it!
PHILIP: Three hundred million years of evolution have created the greatest butcher the world's ever known.
KATHRYN: It's one of the world's greatest creatures.
PHILIP: A shark could have a hundred embryos in its sack. You know how many are born? Maybe five. They eat each other before birth! They're born killers!
KATHRYN: The only Great White in captivity, Calvin. All those people standing in line...
