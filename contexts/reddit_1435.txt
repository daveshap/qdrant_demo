I had a panic attack at work today in front of a room full of patients
I work as a receptionist in a GP. Been there a couple of months. Today was the first time someone shouted at me. Her appointment was moved from with a doctor to an advance nurse who I explained could also deal with the issue she was having. She slowly got very angry and I ended up crying sat at the desk after she left (missing her appointment). I had to call my coworker down and sat in the toilet for like 10 minutes then 20 minutes with my boss trying to catch my breath. All in all took me over 50 minutes to breath normally again.

I've always had anxiety but never had a panic attack. I've never had a panic attack before, I think it's as I started Citalopram last week. They're only 10mg so I'm surprised at how much its effected me.

Cheers for reading! Just trying to come to terms with what happened

EDIT: Blown away by the response! Not just upvotes but real advice, I posted this in a few sub's to try to get some light shed on what happened and this has just been so helpful and supportive, thank you!
