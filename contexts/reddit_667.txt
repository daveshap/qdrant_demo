I’m starting to hate my mom
Ok for background information It used to just be me my mom and my two brothers my dad was an abusive drug addict who spent most of my like in and out of jail they have been divorced since I was probably 3 I’m 16 now and my mom starting dating this guy around 8 years ago and we have lived with him and his son for about 6 years and my mom had literally become insane since being with him he’s a few years older than her the same as my dad and like she is constantly starting arguments and hitting him and breaking stuff he is a nice guy never just her back or anything but she is like crazy now and I hate being around her for context of how my mom is last year they were arguing about a bathroom window being left open it wasn’t a big deal at all but she made it one she kicked down their bedroom door and threw it at him it was a thin hollow door but still who tf reacts like that and it was mine and my brothers bathroom so it definitely wasn’t him that opened the window but anyways earlier tonight I was asleep and I woke up to screaming because my mom wanted the dog to go in her cage to sleep my dog isn’t aggressive and could have very easily put the dog up herself but ofc she wanted to make a big deal out of it so I obviously being annoyed came out of my room and asked why everything needs to be an argument and she fucking runs up the stairs and start screaming at me about how she’s tired of all of us and she hates us I swear every time I’m in a good mood and I get around her I end up crying in the bathroom I really don’t know what to do I’m so tired of being around her my mom used to be such a nice person she wasn’t like this at all I don’t think anyone is even gonna read to the end if this but please I need advice and I have nobody else to talk to about this
