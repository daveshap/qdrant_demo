How to get over boys?
I’ve been having a rough guy streak. Some months ago I got out of a three year relationship, then a guy ghosted me, his friend tried to hook up with me, a boy became obsessed with me, a guy tried to pay me to kick him (wtf), and now I’m talking to another guy (not romantically, just getting to know each other, but I don’t want to get hurt). I just want guys off my mind but I’m a romantic at heart and fall easily. How can I just take a break?
