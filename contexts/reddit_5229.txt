Am I at fault?
I am getting in trouble for not coming into work on a day I was not scheduled to work. I just started working at Fred Meyers as a Clerk and it was going well until this weekend when on my wall schedule and written one I was scheduled to be off Saturday and Sunday. But on Saturday afternoon around 12 I received a call stating that I was a "No call No show" and that I was going to be disciplined for not coming in even though my schedule says I dont work Saturday or sunday. I'm very confused and even checked that it was the correct date being referred to on my schedule, which I was correct and the word OFF was on Saturday June 6th, so I'm very confused if this is my fault or what do I do?
