New hire is making more than me. How should I address this with my boss professionally?
I just found out that the new hire is making $2.00 more per hour than I am. I'm trying to understand why she was offered more than me given she has little to no experience in the industry. I was given the task of training her and I have gone above and beyond to ensure she has the knowledge to succeed in her role. Last week we were discussing vacation time and I was explaining to her that 40 hours of it is accrued, but she insisted that her offer states differently. She pulled up her offer letter on her phone and shows me where it talks about vacation time and right about it is her salary. I couldn't not look, it was right there! Of course, I didn't say anything, but I was screaming on the inside!!

How can someone I'm training for the same role be making more than I am? I came to this company 7 months ago with over 2 years of experience in the industry, extensive knowledge of the market, and a college degree. I was recognized with multiple awards at my old company and had a proven track record of succeeding in my role. Now she's here with no experience and no college degree and making more than me. (Side note: according to my manager, her resume had a few years of experience in our industry. But clearly that isn't true because I have had to explain very basic concepts to her. Someone with any kind of experience would already be very familiar with essential, basic concepts.)

I talked to my manager and asked her for a raise. Her response was to set up a meeting with the regional manager and discuss it with her. She also told me that its probably not in the budget and usually you don't qualify for a raise until you've been employed with the company 1 year.

I set up a meeting with the regional manager for this Thursday. How can i approach this situation with her professionally, but also letting her know that I feel extremely undervalued? Should I quit if my request is denied?
