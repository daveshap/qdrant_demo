MAURICE: Boys and girls, Moms and Dads. Children of all ages, I'd like you to meet... Jimmy Bones.
BILL: What the hell you talking about?
MAURICE: This is the story of Jimmy Bones/Black as night and hard as stones/Gold plated deuce
BILL: You think that's really him?
MAURICE: Damn. It's so...fresh.
TIA: Boy, put that thing down. You can't take that. Might be evidence.
PATRICK: Evidence of what?
TIA: Somehow I don't think he stabbed himself in the chest, then buried himself too.
