Dear colleges, please stop asking WHY I do stuff
I don’t know why I’m interested in the sciences. I’m just naturally drawn to it more than I am to the humanities. I want to help people with a career in the sciences, but I can’t pinpoint a specific incident that sparked my interest in STEM or made me want to help people.

I don’t know why I like music or why I like basketball. I 👏 don’t 👏 know👏 why I do stuff sometimes, and I don’t wanna get to know me better

Although i guess it is kinda cool that writing these essays requires me to reflect on a lotta things and try to understand myself more

Edit: I understand that sometimes if you can’t say why, maybe it’s because your parents want you to become a doctor or apply to a certain school, but I feel like it’s not the case a lotta times. Sometimes you love what you do, but it’s hard to find an explanation as to why if you don’t dig deep enough or come up with a plausible story.

##**Edit 2:**
I understand the meaning behind colleges asking us why we want to apply or why we do X activity, and I agree that it's better to have a solid reason than to not have one. I recognize that I’m fortunate enough to have the chance to apply to college, but this is just a rant. It’s just something I was thinking of as I was writing my essays, it’s not meant to be taken seriously.
