Flashbacks about a girl are messing with my head
Not really sure where to start.

Long story short, we started out a bit physical, then she wanted to just be friends, while I didn't. She dated other guys for awhile while I stuck around, but that just make me angry and self-loathing. After about 9 months of that, I tell her we have to stop seeing eachother so much. We both get over the initial separation, and life goes on. A couple months later, I text her again. We get flirty, one thing leads to another, and she ends up cheating on her (douchebag) boyfriend with me, to a certain degree.

We're basically back to not-talking again. I can accept all of that, but what's bothering me now is all the emotional bullshit that comes from remembering everything that happened between us.

Remembering the good stuff, like when we kissed, or hung out just the two of us, and spontaniously drove to wherever in the middle of the night is great, but once I snap back to reality, I still miss her. Then sometimes I remember the bad stuff, like when I figure out stuff that she's lied to me about to make herself look better, or like when she tells me about who she started dating, or how he didn't give a shit when she had a kidney stone, or when she would tell me about getting drunk at a party and do some really stupid stuff, or when she enabled another guy to cheat on his girlfriend with her, when she knew full well about both of them. I recognize this wishy-washy, enabling behavior, and I get mad that she can't recognize the hard she's doing to herself and others.

Sometimes I feel like I should be around and trying to protect her from herself and others, because I really do care, and the rest of the time, I know I need to stay away because she's just a drug for me. Something brief and fun in the moment, but followed by guilt, regret, and misery.

Anyway, that's what's bothering me today. Hope you all are doing well.
