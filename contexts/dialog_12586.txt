ROB: Great.
DICK: I'll tape it for you.
ROB: No, that's okay. Really.
DICK: 'Cause you like their second one, you said, Pop, Girls. etc. The one with Cheryl Ladd on the cover. You didn't see the cover though.

DICK: Well, I'll just make it for you.
ROB: Okay.

DICK: The new Belle and Sebastian. Like it?
