COLLEEN: Does it give you some sort of perverse pleasure to expose your...penis in plain view of my sixteen year-old daughter?

COLLEEN: You'll have to explain that to the police.
GEORGE: You were the only neighbor I could tolerate.
COLLEEN: I did warn you.
GEORGE: My life is a warning. I just can't figure out for what.
