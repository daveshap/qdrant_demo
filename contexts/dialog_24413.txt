ACOSTA: It's gotta be tough keeping an eye on everything.
SECURITY SUPERVISOR: And everybody, all the time. Yeah, it's a chore.
ACOSTA: So, Bill, if I understand this right, you currently have your penthouse floor under construction?
SECURITY SUPERVISOR: That's correct.
ACOSTA: But with these down, doesn't that pose a major security concern if, as you say, you have to keep an eye on everything at all times?
SECURITY SUPERVISOR: Well, we were worried about dust and debris from the work being done ruining the cameras, so--
ACOSTA: -- so you shut them off?
SECURITY SUPERVISOR: Yes, but no -- we have personnel stationed at both ends of that hall, twenty-four hours a day.
ACOSTA: What kind of personnel?
SECURITY SUPERVISOR: Right now? A six man security force, plus a member of our Butler staff. So seven men total.
ACOSTA: You have a butler working that floor?
SECURITY SUPERVISOR: Uh -- well, yes, uh just in terms of the men up there now, my team, he's serving lunch and dinner and just doing general upkeep so --
ACOSTA: So there are no guests staying on that floor?
