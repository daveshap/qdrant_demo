PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN: An atomic bomb.
MARTY: Professor, be serious, would you?
PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN: I am serious. If we could get you, the time machine, and the power converter in the vicinity of an atomic blast, we could send you back to the future.
MARTY: You're talking crazy! An atomic blast would melt me and the time machine in a matter of seconds!
PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN: You forget -- time travel is instantaneous. The time machine would melt, but you would have already travelled through time. Of course, it's a moot point regardless. The only place atomic bombs are detonated is at the Army's Nevada Test Site, and those tests are kept absolutely top secret.
