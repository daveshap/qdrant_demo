What are the substantive merits or detriments of Trump's economic worldview as outlined in his recent interview?
The Economist [published the full transcript of its interview with President Trump](http://www.economist.com/Trumptranscript?fsrc=scn/tw/te/bl/ed/transcriptinterviewwithdonaldtrump) (Treasury Secretary Mnuchin was also present). The vast majority of the interview centres around the economy, specifically Trump's economic worldview and his intentions regarding policy.

Using the interview as the basis for the leader in this week's edition of the magazine The Economist[ takes a very dim view](http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21721904-impulsiveness-and-shallowness-americas-president-threaten-economy-well-rule) of what it calls "Trumponomics"

Without detailed and scored spending plans it is, of course, hard to fully assess the Trump's policies. However, the interview is broad and I think shows enough of Trump's thinking to allow one to take a view. 

In view of this, I was curious as to what the potential benefits and downsides of his economic policies/plans/thinking, would be? And whether they are politically feasible would congress  allow him to go as far as he seems to want to?
