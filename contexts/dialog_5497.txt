CAITLIN: What are you doing on Theo's line?
LENORE: Taking messages.
CAITLIN: He ran out on me to be with you? Well fuck him! Everything worked twice as good without him. We didn't need him then and I don't need him now.
LENORE: I'm sure he'll be heartbroken.
CAITLIN: I know he's there! He doesn't even have the balls to pick up the phone!
LENORE: I won't let him. He belongs to me now. Bye, sweetie.
THEO: Know what else is in here?
LENORE: Take your hand out of there. Slowly.
