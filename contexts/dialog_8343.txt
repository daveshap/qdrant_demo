MAC: Thirty-five next generation microchips. Copper, not silicon. Value: one million each.
THIBADEAUX: You're giving them to me?
MAC: Call it an expression of trust.
THIBADEAUX: Thought you had to use some of these.
MAC: You don't really think I'd leave ten million dollars worth of our chips in her bag? What matters isn't what's real. It's what we <u>think</u> is real--what matters is the art.
MAC: Take this mask. It may look like the Empress, but it's not.
THIBADEAUX: I figured that out.
MAC: The face decays, the mask doesn't. Art lasts, we don't. That's why art's so valuable. It's a little piece of immortality.
THIBADEAUX: You got a real problem with priorities, you know that?
MAC: I really don't think that's a topic on which you have much to offer.
THIBADEAUX: Did I ever tell you what Tina wrote? The night she died?
