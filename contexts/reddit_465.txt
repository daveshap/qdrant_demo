I am very confused
here is some background info:
*I'm 15 y/o
*I have 2 siblings that are in their 20s, have graduated college, and are not living with me
*my sister divorced an abusive husband who is the older brother of somebody very popular at my school
*my parents are: in their late 50s,  depressed but do not get help, only watch TV after work, creationists, both have abusive childhoods
*I've been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder, depression, ocd, and aspergers
*I'm in all advanced classes and in the gifted program

I have not done anything with my life besides play a select few video games (especially Roblox), watch YouTube, and masturbate. I barely interact with my family, even though they care about me very much. I'm an atheist, and I don't know how I will confront my parents about that , considering the last time my dad was confronted with something extraordinarily stressful (his parents getting in a car accident), he had a stroke. Also, I don't know about my sexuality. In real life, I only feel attracted to girls and look at them from time to time, but my sexuality is all over the place when I masturbate. I could want to give to a female, or take it from a dude, or give it to one. I have only masturbated to real life porn of girls, never guys. However, I have wanked to cartoon/furry/hentai guys, girls, yadda yadda. I have never looked or felt attracted to a guy, and I don't think I'm blocking anything. I could be though, and that worries me to no end. That could also be my OCD, same with my trans thoughts. I don't feel like I urgently need to become a woman or am one, but it comes up occasionally. Again, it could be my OCD, or I could be lying to myself. I don't know what to do with my life either. I think I want to do something in STEM and or music, but that could be another lie, and I really haven't explored my options. I have not had any will or desire to do anything. I had the occasional best friend, but it was only them, and it always ended in me realizing they were using me the whole time. I can't make any friends because they either have their own friend group and or are connected to the younger brother of that scumbag. I have never been directly bullied, but I can tell he is up to something.

I'm sorry if this makes no sense or is too descript. I am craving for help, and my parents won't get help for me, since it never worked for them, and they don't want to "disappoint" me.
