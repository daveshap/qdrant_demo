UNCLE AL: I come here because Marty needs a friend.
NAN: Yes... you've always been that to him. But if you can't leave your booze in whatever dump you call home, you better just stay away.
MARTY: Mom was really mad at him this time, wasn't she?
JANE: What do you expect, when he comes in smelling like a brewery and looking like an unmade bed?
MARTY: Stop it!
