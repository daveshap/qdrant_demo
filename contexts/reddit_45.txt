i lost one of my best friends
her mom made her cut communication with me. she lives in a diff state. it's been two days since then and haven't talked to her since. i don't have many friends, so it hit hard. wasn't necessarily just me she had to abandon, there were some others. i miss her. i may never get to talk to her again, and if i do, i will most likely be quite a long time. any advice?
