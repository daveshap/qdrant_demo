PEGGY: I was impressed with what you said in English class today.
MICHAEL: Gilfond's okay, except he thinks Hemingway's great Literature.
PEGGY: You don't?
MICHAEL: He's a fisherman! The most overrated writer of the century. I mean, he's the perfect American author — fat, violent, drunk...
PEGGY: Maybe you're confusing his life with his work.
MICHAEL: A writer's life is his work. Jack Kerouac doesn't have to kill a bull to have something to write about. He's out there feeling, burning... grooving on life!
PEGGY: The young man leaned back in his chair. No bulls would die today.
MICHAEL: What're you doing here anyway?
PEGGY: Coffee and a donut.
MICHAEL: I thought chicks like you traveled in packs.
PEGGY: Hey, man, I'm a hip chick.
DOLORES: Terry, slow down.
TERRY: Okay.
DOLORES: Terry! Slow down.
TERRY: What, why?
DOLORES: There's Peggy with Michael Fitzsimmons.
TERRY: That commie beatnik? What's she doing with him? Wait'll I tell Charlie.
DOLORES: First a nerd and then a weirdo. What a bunch of nose pickers. I'll tell Charlie.
MICHAEL: This is great reefer.
PEGGY: Yeah. I'm surprised. It's really old... Travels well though. You know, the world looks a lot better from up here.
MICHAEL: The world is fantastic. It's the ultimate absurd circus. I am shot from a cannon into the energy.
PEGGY: What are you shooting for?
MICHAEL: Maximum intensity. Yeah. I can't wait to get out of here. I'm gonna write. I'm gonna check out of this bourgeois motel. Push myself away from the dinner table and say 'No more Jell—O for me, Mom.'
PEGGY: Don't you get along with your parents?
MICHAEL: The only thing my father digs is cold, green money. All my mother cares about is her standing at the country club.
PEGGY: They care about you. They're just a different generation.
MICHAEL: Hey what's with you? I thought you were cool. You rode my bike. You blew some pot. What's your scene Miss Majorette? You gonna marry Mr. Blue Impala and graze around with all the other sheep for the rest of your life?
PEGGY: I already did that. I want to be a dancer, I want to dance.
