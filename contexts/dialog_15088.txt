GRANT: - - like birds - -
ELLIE: - - like birds. What happen is, they swallow the stones and hold them in a muscular sack in their stomachs - -
GRANT: - - a gizzard - -
ELLIE: - - which is called a gizzard, and it helps them mash their food, but what happens after a while - -
GRANT: - - what happens is that after a while, the stones get smooth, every six weeks, so the animal regurgitates them - -
ELLIE: - - barfs them up - -
GRANT: - - and swallows fresh ones.
ELLIE: And when she swallows the stones, she swallows the poison berries too. That's what makes her sick. Good work Tim.
GENNARO: Doctors, if you please - - I have to insist we get moving.
ELLIE: Oh, you know, if it's alright, I'd like to stay with Dr. Harding and finish with the trike. Is that okay?
HARDING: Sure. I've got a gas powered jeep. I can drop her at the visitor's center before I make the boat with the others.
ELLIE: I'll catch up with you. You can go with the others.
GRANT: Are you sure?
ELLIE: I'll just finish. Yeah, I want to finish.
