MARY: You're very... kind.
NORMAN: It's all for you. I'm not hungry. Please go ahead.
NORMAN: You eat like a bird.
MARY: You'd know, of course.
NORMAN: Not really. I hear that expression, that one eats like a bird
MARY: It's a strange hobby. Curious, I mean.
NORMAN: Uncommon, too.
MARY: I imagine so.
NORMAN: It's not as expensive as you'd think. Cheap, really. Needles, thread, sawdust .. the chemicals are all that cost anything.
MARY: A man should have a hobby.
NORMAN: It's more than a hobby... sometimes... a hobby is supposed to pass the time, not fill it.
MARY: Is your time so empty?
NORMAN: Oh, no! I run the office, tend the cabins and grounds, do little chores for mother... the ones she allows I might be capable of doing.
MARY: You go out... with friends?
NORMAN: Friends? Who needs friends. A boy's best friend is his mother. You've never had an empty moment in your whole life. Have you?
MARY: Only my share.
NORMAN: Where are you going? I don't mean to pry...
MARY: I'm looking for a private island.
NORMAN: What are you running away from?
MARY: Why do you ask that?
NORMAN: No. People never run away from anything. The rain didn't last very long. You know what I think? I think we're all in our private traps, clamped in them, and none of us can ever climb out. We scratch and claw... but only at the air, only at each other, and for all of it, we never budge an inch.
MARY: Sometimes we deliberately step into those traps.
NORMAN: I was born in mine. I don't mind it anymore.
MARY: You should... mind it.
NORMAN: Oh I do... but I say I don't.
MARY: If anyone ever spoke to me, the way I heard... The way she spoke to you, I don't think I could ever laugh again.
NORMAN: Sometimes when she talks that way to me I'd like to... curse her out and leave her forever! Or at least, defy her. But I couldn't. She's ill.
MARY: She sounded strong...
NORMAN: I mean... ill. She had to raise me all by herself after my dad died... I was only five... and it must have been a strain. Oh, she didn't have to go out to work or anything, Dad left us with a little something... anyway, a few years ago... Mother met a man. He talked her into building this motel... We could have talked her into anything... and when. Well... It was just too much for her when he died, too... And the way he died... Oh, it's nothing to talk about when you're eating. Anyway, it was too much of a loss for my mother... she had nothing left.
MARY: Except you.
NORMAN: A son is a poor substitute for a lover.
MARY: Why don't you go away?
NORMAN: To a private island, like you?
MARY: No, not like me.
NORMAN: It's too late for me. And besides... who'd look after her? She'd be alone up there, the fire would go out... damp and cold, like a grave. When you love someone, you don't do that to them, even if you hate them. Oh, I don't hate her. I hate... what she's become. I hate... the illness.
MARY: Wouldn't it be better if you put her in... someplace...
NORMAN: An Institution? A madhouse? People always call a madhouse someplace." Put her in Someplace!"
MARY: I'm sorry... I didn't mean it to sound uncaring...
NORMAN: What do you mean about caring? Have you ever seen one of those places? Inside? Laughing and tears and cruel eyes studying you... and my mother there? Why? has she harmed you? She's as harmless as... one of these stuffed birds.
MARY: I am sorry. I only felt... it seemed she was harming you. I meant...
NORMAN: Well? You meant well? People always mean well, they cluck their thick tongues and shake their heads and suggest so very delicately that...
NORMAN: I've suggested it myself. But I hate to even think such a thing. She needs me... and it isn't... ...it isn't as if she were a maniac, a raving thing... it's just that... sometimes she goes a little mad. We all go a little mad sometimes. Haven't you?
MARY: Yes, and just one time can be enough. Thank you.
NORMAN: Thank you, Norman.
MARY: Norman.
NORMAN: You're not going to... to your room already?
MARY: I'm very tired. And I'll have a long drive tomorrow. All the way back to Phoenix.
NORMAN: Phoenix?
MARY: I stepped into a private trap back there -- and I want to go back and... try to pull myself out. Before it's too late for me, too.
NORMAN: Why don't you stay a little while, just for talking.
MARY: I'd like to, but...
NORMAN: Alright. I'll see you in the morning. I'll bring you breakfast. What time will you...
MARY: Very early. Dawn.
NORMAN: Alright, Miss...
MARY: Crane.
NORMAN: That's it.
MARY: Good night.
