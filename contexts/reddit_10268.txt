Mental illness is bullshit
Life is shit. The world is going to hell. We're slaves to our wages. There's no fucking point to anything and it's got nothing to do with mental health. The world is just shit and I want nothing to do with it. I'm not fucking sick. I'm sick of people telling me I'm sick in a piece of shit world that's sick. If anything, I see the world better than most. There's really no point to be here. Why prolong this endless suffering? If anyone says I'm selfish, they're the fucking selfish ones for wanting me to be here only to help them while I fucking suffer every moment. Fuck everything.
