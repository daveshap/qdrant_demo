HOLLY: I can't go with him.
CHRIS: Look, I don't care whether you go with Doug or not, but you_ve got to see him before he leaves.
HOLLY: You don't understand, I can't!
CHRIS: Listen, Doug took the rap for us all so grab your coat 'cause you're going.
HOLLY: I made a deal with Josh.
CHRIS: What?
HOLLY: It was a condition of getting Doug out.
CHRIS: What are you talking about?
HOLLY: In return for Doug's freedom, I was never to see him again, I had to - it was his only chance.
CHRIS: Josh didn't get Doug out of jail, he did a deal in return for some computer disks we'd held onto.
HOLLY: You mean, Josh's father had nothing to do with it?
CHRIS: No!
HOLLY: You're sure?
CHRIS: Sure I'm sure!
