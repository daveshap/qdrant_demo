Recommendations for a master's program in higher education and student affairs?
Hello all, and HAPPY SEPTEMBER! Good luck with move-in and fall term! 

I was wondering if anybody had any suggestions for a higher education and student affairs graduate program? I'm particularly interested in a counseling-based program-- that, or a program with a focus on student development. I'm not location-bounded, and have no preferences in regards to size, but it would be nice if the program offered many GAs for their students-- a GA in reslife is a MUST, as that is my area of passion. :) 

It would be an absolute PLUS if living partners are allowed in the res halls, as I'm engaged but don't plan to marry for another year or so.

Thank you all so much, and I hope y'all have a wonderful long weekend.
