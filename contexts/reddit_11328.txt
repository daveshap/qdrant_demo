I'm becoming a hater
I've always been taught to respect people as if they were myself, to give them the same treatment I'd like to have from them. I've spent almost my entire life looking for my "spiritual path" (and I think I found it), and so on.

At an early age I found out myself as gay (I mean: when I was 4 or 5 years old), and due to the education I had I used to see myself as filthy, sinner. More than that I used to think that the right woman would be able to put my homosexuality in a "dormant" state. I got married at 23 y.o., and divorced at 27. Then I had my first contact with another man, and, well, I discovered where my pleasure and my happiness dwell.

At that point I realized that being gay was not a problem to me, and I love myself as a gay man. But at the same time I realized that a large number of people hate gays just because they do, and I started to develop a hidden hate for all heterosexual people, including my relatives.

A few years in therapy and I got rid of this generalized hate. But the hate for religious people that label themselves as "christians", improved. I know I hate them because I fear them. I am always afraid of going out and being attacked by some homophobic jerk. If I could, I'd move to some gay community somewhere, but at this point I can't afford it yet.

But what's actually bothering me is: in a rational level I know nobody would attack me (because of my appearance, my size, my "bad guy mood", whatever), and those intolerant religious people deserve pity, or maybe just contempt; I know this hate I see everywhere is just a projection of my own hate and I don't know what to do with it.

I'd really like to be a better person for me, for my partner, for my mother and brother, and for all the rest of the world, but hating people because of their believes just makes me a hater, someone I don't like to be.

**TL; DR: I'm becoming a hater, specially against religious people.**
