Straight up sobbing right now.
**EDIT**: **Apparently my post has really upset some people. I've been receiving nasty messages in my inbox and on this post. I am not trying to "pretend I'm better than anyone else" or trying to "rub it in" anyone's faces. I have been struggling for a LONG LONG time. I'm sorry that me being thankful and grateful for this unexpected help has upset people. That wasn't my intention at all.**


My spring semester officially ended on Monday. I got an email in my student account saying to check my student information center because I had been sent an important message by the college. Not gonna lie, I got scared that it had something to do with my financial aid. (On track to receive the full Pell grant for the 2020-2021 school year).

I checked my student inbox and saw this:

**Due to the disruption of campus operations as a result of COVID-19 you've been selected to receive a grant in the range of $1000-$1100.  This grant should be used for things such as food, housing, course materials, technology, health care, and child-care.

We expect to be processing these funds within 2 weeks.**

I am straight up ugly crying. I filed for unemployment back in March and have yet to receive a single unemployment or PUA check. I'm so behind on bills. Food banks and the kindness of other Redditors are my saving grace right now. When I finally got my stimulus check, it went to back paying my landlord and utilities but now they are racked back up again. With this grant from my school, I'll be able to pay my share of May's rent and the utilities and might even have a little left over to put on my credit card. And hopefully I will start receiving the unemployment payments soon. This couldn't have come at a better time for me right now!
