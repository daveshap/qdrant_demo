CHANCE: Good morning, Louise.
LOUISE: He's dead, Chance! The Old Man's dead!
CHANCE: ... I see.
LOUISE: Must of happened durin' the night, I don't know... Lord, he wasn't breathin' and as cold as a fish. I touched him, just to see, and you believe me, Chance - that's doin' more than I get paid to do... Then I just covered him up, pulled the sheet over his head...
CHANCE: Yes. I've seen that done.
LOUISE: Then I got the hell out of that room and called the doctor and I think I woke him probably, he wasn't any too alert. He just said, 'Yeah, he's been expectin' it and said he'd send somebody over...' Lord, what a mornin'!
CHANCE: ... Yes, Louise, it's snowing in the garden today. Have you looked outside and seen the snow? It's very white.
LOUISE: Dammit, Boy! Is that all you got to say? More gobbledegook? That Old Man's layin' up there dead as hell and it just don't make any difference to you!
CHANCE: Yes, Louise. I have seen it often. It happens to old people.
LOUISE: Well, ain't that the truth...
CHANCE: Yes. It is.
LOUISE: Oh, Lord, Chance - I don't know what I was expectin' from you... I'm sorry for yellin' like I did... No sir, I just don't know what I was expectin' ... ... I 'spose I'd better gather up some breakfast for you...
CHANCE: Yes, I'm very hungry.
LOUISE: Well, no more stewin' those prunes every mornin', that's somethin', I guess... ... what are you goin' to do now, Chance?
CHANCE: I'm going to work in the garden.
