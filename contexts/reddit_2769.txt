What trades or backup careers can I learn on the weekends or at nights?
I'm a 25 year old software engineer, and I make good money doing it. However, I want to have some kind of fallback career in case my industry collapses, I get burnt out, or I just decide that I don't want to live near a major metropolitan area anymore.

I wanted to learn something tangible, something where I could work with my hands. Electrician, Plumber, etc. and not something which requires a degree or less hands-on work. Something where there's pretty much always SOME kind of demand for that skill (though I know there's no such thing as an industry invulnerable to recession).

I looked into learning to be an electrician in my area, but it seems impossible to learn and be certified just on the nights or weekends - these things require a pretty much full time commitment through shadowing and apprenticeship.

Are there good trades I can learn and take night or weekend classes at a community college or through a trade school?

Obviously, the ability to actually attend any of these classes is limited by the present medical situation on the planet, but let's just pretend it's 2019 again.
