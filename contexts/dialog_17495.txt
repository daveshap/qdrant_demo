JOE: No, I don't --
DREW: Not good, not bad, you know what we got? Nothing. No credit, no cars, no mortgages -- no wives. Nothing.
JOE: You first.
SUSAN: Why don't you get off his case?
DREW: Oh, you're the great Joe's attorney now? Are we going to go to court? Or are we going to go to bed? And I don't mean you and me. I mean you and him.
SUSAN: That's it. It's over. Get out.
DREW: So I guess a blowjob's out of the question?
JOE: Almost.
SUSAN: I said get out.
