ELLIE: Where are you taking me?
ANDREWS: South America.
ELLIE: South America!
ANDREWS: We leave Miami in an hour. Soon's we get some supplies aboard.
ELLIE: You'll have a corpse on your hands! That what You'll have. I won't eat a thing while I'm on this boat.
ANDREWS: In that event, we won't need so many supplies.
ELLIE: What do you expect to accomplish by all this? I'm already married!
ANDREWS: I'll get it annulled.
ELLIE: You'll never do it! You can't do it!
ANDREWS: I'll do it if it takes every penny I've got. I'll do it if I have to bribe that musical comedy Justice of the Peace! I'll do it—if I have to prove that you were dragged in, staggering drunk. You probably were. Mmm—mmm. This filet mignon is divine!
ELLIE: What've you got against King Westley?
ANDREWS: Nothing much. I just think he's a fake, that's all.
ELLIE: You only met him once .
ANDREWS: That was enough. Do you mind handing me the ketchup?
ELLIE: You talk as if he were a gigolo—or something.
ANDREWS: Never mind—I'll get it myself. Gigolo? Why, you took the word right out of my mouth. Thanks.
ELLIE: He's one of the best fliers in the country. Right now he's planning a trip to Japan.
ANDREWS: You're going to finance him, I suppose.
ELLIE: Why not? Look what he's doing for aviation. It takes courage to do what he does. And character! At least he's accomplished something worthwhile. I suppose you'd like to have me marry a business man. Well, I hate business men—particularly if you're a shining example.
ELLIE: Your whole life is devoted to just one thing. To accumulate more money. At least there's romance in what he's doing.
ANDREWS: He's no good, Ellie, and you know it. You married him only because I told you not to.
ELLIE: You've been telling me what not to do since I was old enough to remember. I'm sick of it!
