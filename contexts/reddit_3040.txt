All goes well with phone interviews but when they meet me in person - no go. What am I doing wrong?
I’m an older woman with lots of experience in Project management, a job description where there are good opportunities. My skill set is well rounded with lots of Admin. I don’t feel like I’m being disingenuous on my resume, but dates of graduation and a few of my earlier jobs are omitted. I get quite a few interviews, luckily, but I can tell the recruiter or hiring manager is a little unsettled when I come in for a chat. I get a lot of interview experience but that’s about all. No offers. 

I feel like my next move should be to go to an employment agency and lay it all out there, what I’ve been through with this ‘issue’ and see what they say. But since their real mission is to work for the employer, not the applicant, I’m not sure if this will backfire and they won’t waste their time with my application. 

I’ve updated my look and am really upbeat when I show up. I’m sure I’m projecting my enthusiasm to want the position and how hard I’m willing to work. Has anyone overcome this situation? Any advice?
