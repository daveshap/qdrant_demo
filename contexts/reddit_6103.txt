Might have my offer rescinded tomorrow, what questions should I be ready to ask?
Iâ€™m a graduating senior supposed to start in August 2020. Last week, a classmate who will be starting at the same company (but in June) had a call with HR and had their job offer rescinded due to COVID-19. 

HR reached out to me to schedule a call for tomorrow. If the worst happens, what kind of questions should I be ready to ask?
