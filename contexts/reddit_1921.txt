I just found out that my financial aid package is covering EVERYTHING with scholarships and grants
I’m actually speechless right now. 

I got the Carolina Covenant which will pay for everything loan-free. This is such a weight off my shoulders, because I was stressing so much over applying to scholarships. Oh my goddd I’m so happy! Let’s go Tar Heels!!!!
