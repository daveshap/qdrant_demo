LESTAT: Pain is terrible for you. You feel it like no other creature because you are a vampire. You don't want it to go on.
LOUIS: No...
LESTAT: Do what it is in your nature to do. And you will feel as you felt with that child in your arms.
LOUIS: Oh God Lestat. I felt peace. I felt an end to the craving.
LESTAT: That and more.
LESTAT: Evil is a point of view. God kills, indiscriminately, and so shall we. For no creatures under God are as we are, none so like him as ourselves.
LOUIS: Is God merciless? Greedy and cruel?
LESTAT: Ah, but we have even more in common with our creator. come, I am like a mother tonight. I want a child.
LESTAT: She's here, your wounded one.
LOUIS: What are you saying?
LESTAT: You need company, Louis. More congenial than mine...
LOUIS: Lestat!
LESTAT: You remember how you wanted her, the taste of her -
LOUIS: I didn't want to kill her.
LESTAT: Don't worry, Louis, you're conscience is clear. You left her alive.
LESTAT: Claudia, Claudia, listen to me. You're ill, my precious and I'm going to give you what you need to get well.
LOUIS: Lestat, what do you mean?
