Juniors - Harvard sending you mail literally means nothing
Last year around this time, Harvard sent me a packet asking me to apply. I was in the shower and my mom saw it. She proceeded to take a picture of it and send it to every family member. We didn’t have plans for spring break (this happened like two weeks before it) and she’s like “lol now we need to go to Boston.” Since it was spring break for most schools around the country, they had no tours. She literally made me email the office of admissions and like “ummm excuse me but I got a package from you! You need to get me on a tour!” And they said “no peasant.” We ended up taking a trip to the northeast to do visits (not at Harvard lol)

Anyway, getting letters/packages from schools like Harvard mean nothing. If you hadn’t heard of this already, here’s what happens:

Harvard (along with other schools) want to have as low as an acceptance rate as possible. They don’t want to decrease the size of incoming classes so therefore they have to have a large applicant pool. How do they do that? Sending thousands of high schoolers letters encouraging them to apply. Kids think “wow! Harvard wants me!” But no, honey. They just want your application.
