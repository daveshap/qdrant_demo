ARTEMUS: Jim, are you all right?
JIM: No, I'm not all right. They got away. And we can't even follow them. They can get off the tracks anywhere they want.
ARTEMUS: Which is why we're heading to Houston, Texas. Home of the Loveless Steam Engine Works.
ARTEMUS: If you don't mind my asking, were you always the way you are?
JIM: What way is that?
ARTEMUS: So... spontaneous. All that leaping off buildings and Chinese fighting and whatnot.
JIM: Spontaneous." I like that. Most people say something like "hare- brained reckless son-of-a-bitch.""
ARTEMUS: Well... that, too.
JIM: Nothing much to it really. When I was younger I got into a pretty bad run-in with the Wyler Boys. I saw them coming. But I didn't act fast enough. Second-guessed myself. And it cost me... cost me dearly.
ARTEMUS: So... what happened?
JIM: Those kids, they took my wagon. Never got it back.
ARTEMUS: Uh... how long ago was this?
JIM: I was six. And ever since, my policy is: Act first and worry later.
