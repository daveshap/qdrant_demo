Hey there, 

&#x200B;

I know a look of people like to bash for working at amazon, and it's true it's terrible to work at, but if you are the lucky few  your job their isn't to bad, and well it pays my bills, some days you don't feel like a slave.

Now that Christmas is over the work at amazon warehouses goes down, so they need to say bye to the temp hires they hired, and the Blue badges who are hired by amazon, need to get moved around. So about 3-4 months ago, they needed to move people from one side of the warehouse to the other, to balance workflow, basically what happened is the managers picked who they would class lazy workers and gave them a letter saying they are getting moved over, this was with no notice at all, and they were given the worst shifts possible, over the weekend, plus nights since whom i work with work at night, but during the weekdays, so of course everyone was unhappy and complained, so this time around HR, wanted to be more fair about it, they gave us more notice and a chance to volunteer to move over to the other side of the building, where we also get to pick three different shifts we would like most out of all the available shifts. they needed 60 people in total out of our side of the warehouse from every shift, the rule also was, if not enough people volunteered, they will pick the people who most recently got a Blue badged  (moved from agency and hired by amazon), and So if this was true, I would be on the list to get moved, so the smartest thing to do is to volunteer, and secure a Good shift and not get stuck with a bad one, So in the meeting we sit with our Senior Manager, before we wait for the last person to arrive, we just have general chats before he explains the process and asks if anyone wants to go, In this meeting the important thing i noted is when he said, They wouldn't force you to go from a Night Shift to a Day shift since you are used to your money you get weekly, its about £40 higher, it adds up, and since we all get over worked, no one would wanna get paid less. So with that it gave me more confidence that volunteering would be the best thing in my shoes to do, And I do, so the next week comes, I get my letter and I see that they put me on a Day shift but even worse Mid day, so you work from 12 to 12 at night, with the Day pay lol, now we all at amazon love to gossip and complain to each other, so i find out from my Manager that this Girl is leaving to the other side of the building and I'd be good for her job, she got to sit down xD so i was Like YESSS< but then i was like shit i volunteered to go too, he was like you weren't on the list to go, which just got me mad, since HR lied Senior management lied, They clearly got to pick again who could stay and go, they picked me since I'm not lazy, well I am but they don't catch me, and another point is, this other girl who Got her blue badge way way before anyone and should of been safe, got forced to go, and She got the shift I picked as my first Option, which makes the whole volunteer system bullshit and meaningless in the first place. so of course I go to explain to my manager and he tells me to write a letter, to someone i haven't herd of, or ever seen, in the building. i just want some advise on how I put a letter together, since clearly from this mess Im not much of a writer.

I know that if i send a letter to the write person in the building something could be done, for someone in my shoes its not much of a big deal, i can still get to work, the £40 less isn't a huge deal, but what if i didn't have a car, or access to work at that time, or really need the extra £40, people who were forced to move over again, are in those situations, maybe exposing their whole process of moving people was a shit show again, maybe they can do it fucking properly.
