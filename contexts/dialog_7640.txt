DONNIE: I can see him right now!
DR. THURMAN: Where is he, Donald?
DONNIE: He's right there... He can read my mind and he'll show me the way out of this. The sky is going to open up... and then He will reveal himself to me.
DR. THURMAN: If the sky were to suddenly open up... there would be no law... there would be no rule. There would only be you and your memories... the choices you've made and the people you've touched. The life that has been carved out from your subconscious is the only evidence by which you will be judged... by which you must judge yourself. Because when this world ends, there will only be you and him... and no one else.
DONNIE: It's too late. I've already ruined my life.
DR. THURMAN: You will survive this... Donald. I promise you that you will survive. You must let me help you. And when I clap my hands together, you will wake up.
