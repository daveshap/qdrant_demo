UNCLE LOUIS: Assassin!
JACQUES: Uncle Louis, this is my friend Johana.
UNCLE LOUIS: Did you buy the cassettes? The Wagner, the Berlioz?
JACQUES: I brought Johana to meet you.
UNCLE LOUIS: Are you crazy? I have no use for a woman! Since my accident.
JACQUES: No, no. Johana is visiting me.
JOHANA: Bonjour Monsieur... Louis.
JACQUES: Uncle Louis. He's a 75 year old amazing guy, isn't he?
JOHANA: I'm very pleased to meet you, Uncle Louis.
