Weyl Semimetal and Fermi Velocity In a Weyl semimetal, the Nielson-Ninomiya theorem enforces the fact that number of positive and negative chirality Weyl points must be equal.Is there any restriction on the form of the Weyl points? That is to say, given a pair of Weyl points, can the positive chirality point have a different Fermi velocity than the negative chirality point (in the absence of symmetries relating the two)?If it is true that the Fermi velocities are allowed to be different, are there any physical consequences of this difference?
