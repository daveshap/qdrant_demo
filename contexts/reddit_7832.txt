What do you wish you took time to learn before undertaking a PhD? (psychology)
Hi guys, I will hopefully be starting a PhD in psychology around mid-July. Until then, I have casual work as a research assistant, but given the current situation I feel like I still have a lot of time on my hands and I want to make the most of it.


So my question is, what skills/programs/resources etc. do you suggest would be most beneficial for me to start learning and looking into now? I guess I'm looking for more practical examples such as programming as opposed to general skills like time management. 


Thanks! 
quick context: I'm based in Australia, so this program will not include any coursework, just the research thesis.
