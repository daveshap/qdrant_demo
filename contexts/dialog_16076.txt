WILKINS: I apologize, Claude. That was rude of me.
CLAUDE: That's alright, boss. Takes a lot more than a colorful brochure to hurt my feelings.
WILKINS: You been on the farm for quite a spell, haven't you?
CLAUDE: Over forty years now. Me and Ray Gibson out there.
WILKINS: Forty years. That's a long time for any crime, even murder.
CLAUDE: It's a hell of a lot longer when you're innocent.
WILKINS: Half the men in this prison swear they're innocent. Don't you think that's kinda funny?
CLAUDE: You have to forgive me if I don't laugh.
RAY: You and Wilkins sure are getting chummy. You two planning on going steady, or something?
CLAUDE: He's just a lonely old man. He likes to talk.
RAY: Hey, I'm a lonely old man. I like to talk, too. So why don't we start by talking about what kind of a plan you're working on?
CLAUDE: I'm not working on a plan.
RAY: You can't fool me, Claude. I know you got something brewing.
CLAUDE: Goodnight, Ray.
RAY: What the hell are you doing?
CLAUDE: Don't touch that car.
CLAUDE: Wilkins' driver's got the flu, so he asked me to fill in for him.
RAY: You haven't driven in 40 years, you ain't even got a license. Man's taking his life in his hands, putting you behind the wheel! Where you taking him?
CLAUDE: Greenville. We're picking up the new Superintendent at the bus station.
WILKINS: You know I trust you, Claude.
CLAUDE: Yes, sir.
WILKINS: I'll be right back.
RAY: Damn, it was getting hot in there.
CLAUDE: What the hell are you doing in that trunk?!
RAY: You didn't think I was gonna let you escape alone, did you?
CLAUDE: I ain't escaping! We're picking up the new super just like I told you.
RAY: Then you're lucky I came along. Doesn't take a visionary to spot a golden opportunity like this. Now help me out of this trunk.
CLAUDE: You ain't getting out of that trunk.
RAY: Come on, man, I'm starting to cramp up here. We have the chance right here, right now, I say we go!
CLAUDE: Go where, Ray?
RAY: Back to New York for starters.
CLAUDE: And what will we do when we get there? I'm sixty-five years old, Ray. So are you. What are we gonna do out here? Get married, have kids, settle down? That boat sailed without us, man.
RAY: This boat's gonna sail without you, too. I don't care if I last one day out here. At least it's one day of freedom. Now gimme those keys.
CLAUDE: Forget about that. You run if you want to, but you're not taking this car.
RAY: Claude, man, I'm serious. Give me those keys.
CLAUDE: I ain't spending a month in the hole so you can take a joy ride.
RAY: Don't make me take them away from you.
CLAUDE: Hey, there's Wilkins!
