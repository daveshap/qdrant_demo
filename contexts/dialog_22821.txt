COLETTE: Could be worse. Oh sorry, forgot who I was talking to.
DANNY: Ouch.
COLETTE: Don't worry, he's probably passed out with his head in the toilet by now.
DANNY: This man sounds like a real catch.
COLETTE: Oh, he's a keeper all right.
DANNY: Colette ...
COLETTE: What?
DANNY: Nothing.
COLETTE: Go ahead.
DANNY: Look, it's really none of my business but why don't you just dump this guy?
COLETTE: It's not that easy.
DANNY: Don't tell me, down deep he's really not a bad person and you don't want to see him get hurt.
COLETTE: Who the fuck are you, Dr. Joyce Brothers? I hate the son-of-a-bitch.
DANNY: Then leave.
COLETTE: I can't.
DANNY: Why not?
COLETTE: You don't understand.
DANNY: There's nothing to understand. The guy is a pig.
COLETTE: I can't leave.
DANNY: You get off on abuse or something?
COLETTE: Fuck you.
DANNY: Then why don't you leave? Just give me one good reason.
COLETTE: Because he'll kill me.
DANNY: Why don't you call the cops?
COLETTE: Why? They don't hold him for more than a day or two.
DANNY: That's long enough to get out of town.
COLETTE: I can't. I've got a kid. She lives with my parents. Quincey knows where they live.
DANNY: Then make sure he gets put away for longer.
COLETTE: How?
