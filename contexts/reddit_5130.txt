How to not take rejections personally?
I get it, it takes over 100 resumes and applications to even come close to getting a job these days. But how do you not take it personally when you make it all the way to the final round of interviews for 4-5 jobs and every single time you get rejected. I don’t care about the companies I never hear from or who I’ve never spoken to, it’s the companies who I’ve met with in person and had multiple hour long conversations with who ultimately reject and then ghost me that are starting to sting. I’ve asked for feedback of every single final interview rejection that I’ve gotten and then I never hear from those companies again. How do you stop feeling like it’s your fault and you’re doing something wrong?
