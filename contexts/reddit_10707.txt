Ever see any of your childhood photos and think "Someone should have killed that kid." or "I'd love to go back and time and end them."?
I know that is beyond dark, but I'm just wondering if I'm not alone in that line of thinking. I admit I was adorable, but sometimes I think about everything leading up to now and wonder if an earlier death would have been best.
