I keep getting Zombie Villagers at night - Minecraft PC 1.12.1 So while I am working at night around my house I keep getting like one or two Zombie Villages around. Does that mean I have another village close by? I have searched thoroughly the immediate area around my spawn so I'm pretty sure there isn't a village close by. The closest village is more than 50 chunks away, and the next one is 60+ away.So what gives? Is it normal for Zombie Villagers to just spawn out of nowhere EVERY NIGHT ? I know there is a slight chance for a zombie to spawn, but every night seems a bit odd.So why am I getting zombies in my own house :D ?
