ENID: Hey - why do you have this?
REBECCA: You lent it to me in like tenth grade.
ENID: I've been looking all over for this.
ENID: Look at how cute I am!
REBECCA: What a little hosebag.
ENID: Look, that's back when I hated you.
REBECCA: I remember every minute of that party.
ENID: There's my dad with Joanie.
REBECCA: I can never keep them all straight - was she the super-bitch?
ENID: No, she was the second wife. The third one was the super-bitch - Maxine. There! Look at her!
