BERTIE: Mr Disraeli. Ma'am.
DISRAELI: Your Royal Highness. What a pleasure to see you here.
BERTIE: Have you met Mr Lyle? He's in sugar...?
DISRAELI: I don't think I've had that pleasure.
BERTIE: No doubt you've heard the rumors.
DISRAELI: I take no account of gossip, Your Highness.
BERTIE: My concern is for the reputation of the Monarchy.
DISRAELI: Of course.
BERTIE: I fear the influence he has on her. The man's word is not to be credited. He is an arriviste of the very lowest water. She's having a bust cast of him. In Nero Marquino marble.
DISRAELI: I see.
BERTIE: I would talk to her myself, but she won't listen to me. She must be persuaded, by someone she respects, to abandon this ridiculous favoritism before a situation develops.
DISRAELI: A situation?
BERTIE: I don't imagine you frequent the Republican Clubs. But the fact that neither you nor I are members should not blind us to the significance of their existence. The Tory Party has always been our party.
DISRAELI: I'm flattered you think so.
BERTIE: I tell you, if we don't stick together on this, you could find yourself First President's Opposition. Du Royaum Uni.
DISRAELI: Quite.
