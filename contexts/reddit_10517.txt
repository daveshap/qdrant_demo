My father took his own life 2 days ago.
I cannot believe he did this. I loved him so much and now he's gone forever. I have my brother and my mother but still I'll be lost and alone forever. I am so sad that I will never laugh with him again or see him. I fucking hate it. It was so unexpected. I wanted him to get old and see my kids. There's no one I can talk to like him. :(
