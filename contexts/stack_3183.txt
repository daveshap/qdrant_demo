Why couldn't Moana see the spiral? Moana and Maui's quest is to restore the Heart of Te Fiti to its rightful place in the spiral but when she arrives at the island, the spiral isn't immediately visible. Later in the film it becomes evident that <blockquote class=\"spoiler\">  Te Ka is in fact Te Fiti when she sees the spiral on its chest. </blockquote>But on multiple occasions we see Te Ka in pretty good detail and the <blockquote class=\"spoiler\">   spiral is nowhere to be seen. </blockquote>Was the climatic battle (and specifically the 'whale splash') necessary to the restoration since the spiral isn't visible until shortly after that? It would have been some nice foreshadowing to see at least some hint of the feature earlier in the movie which makes me think that its absence was purposeful. Are we supposed to see her outer skin as an analogy for emotional armour, that had to be removed before the Heart could be restored?
