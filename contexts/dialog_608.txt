MOTHER MIRIAM: This is permission to take her apart.
MARTHA: Where is she?
MOTHER MIRIAM: Hasn't she had enough?
MARTHA: I have a few more questions to ask her.
MOTHER MIRIAM: My God, but you're determined.
MARTHA: Who knew she was pregnant?
MOTHER MIRIAM: Why do you insist upon pressing...
MARTHA: Was it you?
MOTHER MIRIAM: Is it because she's a nun?
MARTHA: Did you know she was pregnant?
MOTHER MIRIAM: Yes.
MARTHA: And you didn't send her to a doctor.
MOTHER MIRIAM: I didn't guess until it was too late.
MARTHA: For what? An abortion?
MOTHER MIRIAM: Oh, don't be ridiculous.
MARTHA: Too late for what?
MOTHER MIRIAM: I don't know... too late to stop it.
MARTHA: The baby?
MOTHER MIRIAM: The scandal...
MARTHA: You went to the room to help with the birth.
MOTHER MIRIAM: She didn't want any help.
MARTHA: You wanted that child out of the way.
MOTHER MIRIAM: That's a lie.
MARTHA: You hid the wastepaper basket in her room.
MOTHER MIRIAM: I didn't hide it. I put it there for the blood and the dirty sheets.
MARTHA: And the baby.
MOTHER MIRIAM: No!
MARTHA: You tied the cord around its neck.
MOTHER MIRIAM: I wanted her to have it when no-one else was around, they would have taken the baby to a hospital and left it with them, but it was such a difficult birth, there was so much blood and I panicked.
MARTHA: Before or after you killed the child?
MOTHER MIRIAM: I left it with her and I went for help.
MARTHA: I doubt that's what she'd say.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Then she's a liar.
MARTHA: Agnes, can you hear me?
AGNES: Yes.
MARTHA: I want you to remember if you can a night last January. The night Sister Paul died. Do you remember.
AGNES: She said Michael.
MARTHA: What did she mean?
AGNES: The statue. She had shown it to me the day before.
MARTHA: And the passage to the barn?
AGNES: Yes.
MARTHA: Why?
AGNES: So I could go to him.
MARTHA: Who?
AGNES: Him.
MARTHA: How did she know about him?
AGNES: She'd seen him too.
MARTHA: Where?
AGNES: From the belltower the day she before she died.
MARTHA: So she sent you?
AGNES: Yes.
