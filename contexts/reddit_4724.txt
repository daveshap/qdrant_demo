Regret is suffocating
How do you deal with regret you spent the "best years of your life " (18-25) just crying? I didn't really have a lot of fun then. I just focused on passing school.
What sucks is that only now i realize what i could have been. I had horrible self-eestem issues. I couldn't even look at guys i liked. I only got a boyfriend now, but it really bothers me that i have no experience with love and now im in an age where people around me look to settle down while i only really am just discovering what relationships are like. It's like im only now going trough puberty when i should be getting serious. Soon i won't be young anymore and i feel like i never really experienced what 'young' is in that carefree way of self discovery
