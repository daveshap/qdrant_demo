Why were the drug stampers dressed this way? At the very beginning of Season 2, Luke breaks up an operation that was putting his name on drugs, advertising them as \"bulletproof\".All the people putting the stamps on the drugs seem to be female, and dressed in their underwear. Why is this? Clearly it's not because it's extremely hot, because the guards are dressed. Is it meant to keep them uneasy, so they can be exploited better? So the guards can ogle them? Or what?
