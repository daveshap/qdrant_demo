Dating is a process, do it for yourself and have fun.
So tonight I'm feeling a little discouraged. I've been going out on casual dates and tbh they've been fun. Going to local comedy shows, grabbing beer and having engaging conversation, getting out there in the world with someone new and seeing what comes of it. It's been fun, and tbh its exciting to meet new people in new places and take in the world together so to speak. On the heels of this I've started posting online to cast a wider net and Idk if it's just online dating, but it seems as though every time I meet a woman online and they see I'm a thick/heavy dude they politely bow out, but in person my physique doesn't seem to bother the women I talk to/ go out with? I'm not sure if I< am missing something or if that's just how it is online? Insight would be appreciated.
