If the universe is a $3$-torus, must it be longer in some direction? So in a finite universe, I've read one possible topology for a flat universe is a 3 torus. On a 2 torus, it's obviously longer in one direction than the other. Would the same hold true for the universe if it was a 3 torus? Can you not have a \"cubic\" space-time for the universe if it's a 3 torus, would it need to be a rectangular prism instead?
