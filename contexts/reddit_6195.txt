Did I just ruin my chances of getting a job by asking a stupid question?
Hey all, I had a final round interview for a company today in Illinois, a state that recently legalized weed.

I am a huge pot head and I am worried about the drug test. In one of the sections of the interview process, we were put in a room to have an informal lunch with people who are in The position I want. I am very young, 22, and this is an entry level role, most people I was tai g to were 23 or 24.

I wanted to figure out about the drug test, so I started talking to this one girl that worked there, asked her basic questions about the company what she does, and after we hit it off a little I slipped in a question about the drug test. I told her that if I would have to take it within 24 hours of today I would fail because of the recent legalization.

This girl was around 23, and she responded to my question very nicely and gave me the details about the test.

I spoke to my father afterwords and mentioned that I asked a question about the test. He then flipped out at meme, starting cursing, and swearing, and said that was a dumb thing to ask. I felt that she was close enough to my age that it doesn’t matter. He feels there’s no way I’m getting the job now.

What do you guys think? I think it was a harmless question that shell probably forget about. He thinks it was a job ending move.

In hindsight it prob wasn’t the best idea but I don’t think it’ll keep me from getting the job. What do you think?
