SOMERSET: How did the fire fight end?
MILLS: I got him. I got the son-of-a-bitch. See, I was doing really good up till then. Lots of street busts. I've always had this weird luck... everything always went my way, but this was wild. I got him with one shot... right between the eyes. Next thing I know, the mayor's pinning a medal on me. Picture in the paper, whole nine yards.
SOMERSET: How was it?
MILLS: I expected it to be bad, you know. I took a human life... but I slept like a baby that night. I never gave it a second thought.
SOMERSET: I think Hemingway wrote somewhere... I can't remember where, but he wrote that in order to live in a place like this, you have to have the ability to kill. I think he meant you truly must be able to do it, not just faking it, too survive.
MILLS: Sounds like he knew what he was talking about.
