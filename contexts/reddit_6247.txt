Need advice for what is ladies business professional. This is dress code for orientation. The job is business casual.
Hey there.

So I recently accepted a new job at a major hospital. Very excited. The job itself is business casual and you can also wear scrubs (Seems like it's something they're testing new). My interview I even dressed business casual. (grey top with a black cardigan, black slacks, black flats)

So I just re-read my orientation instructions for TOMORROW and it's says the dress is business professional. So I'm kind of freaking out.

Both my mom and my boyfriend are saying it shouldn't be a big deal to wear a solid colored blouse with slacks and shoes. And the term "business professional" for women is different then what it says on the internet. But when I look up on the internet, it says basically a suit for a woman or a dress, which neither I own. I have black slacks and the shoes. I just need a suitable suit jacket and  white top.

So it also says that scrubs are acceptable but I want to make a good impression and feel I shouldn't go this route because:

1. My job is in a office setting so I really wouldn't need scrubs and so it would feel weird to wear this as a first impression for orientation.
2. I'm afraid, what if I'm the only one wearing scrubs? And everyone around me looks all fancy.

Should I follow my gut and buy a suit jacket or could I go without the jacket and just wear slacks, white blouse, and shoes?
