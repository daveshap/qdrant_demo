The Trump Administration’s State Department has directed EU Ambassador Gordon Sondland to not appear for a voluntary scheduled interview before the House Joint Committee with regard to his role in the Trump/Ukraine story. Is the White House/State Dept empowered to prevent Sondland’s testimony?
One source, of many; https://www.npr.org/2019/10/08/768200323/trump-administration-blocks-ambassadors-testimony-a-key-witness-in-ukraine-scand?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

Here’s the statement from Sondland’s legal council, from that article: 

> **"Early this morning, the U.S. Department of State directed Ambassador Gordon Sondland not to appear today for his scheduled transcribed interview before the U.S. House of Representatives Joint Committee,"** the law firm representing Sondland said in a statement. **"Ambassador Sondland had previously agreed to appear voluntarily today, without the need for a subpoena, in order to answer the Committee's questions on an expedited basis. As the sitting U.S. Ambassador to the EU and employee of the State Department, Ambassador Sondland is required to follow the Department's direction."**

Is this a valid explanation? Must an Ambassador to the United States comply with any order or direction the State Department gives them? Is there anywhere the State Dept’s powers are enumerated in this regard? 

Would ordering a subpoena have made the process significantly less “expedited”? What benefit is there to not subpoenaing someone in a high-profile case like this? 

Also;

> House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said Tuesday morning that he considers the blocking of Sondland's testimony and release of documents that Democrats are seeking to be "additional strong evidence of obstruction of the constitutional functions of Congress."

> He added, "We will consider this act today ... to be further acts of obstruction of a co-equal branch of government."

Is this obstruction of justice? Some other crime? If so, on whose part, specifically?

> The State Department **left a voice-mail message with Sondland’s attorneys at 12:30 a.m. Tuesday, informing them that he would not be allowed to testify**, the Democratic committee chairmen leading the impeachment inquiry said in a joint statement.

If Sondland’s attorneys had simply *not checked their voicemail*, would Sondland have been allowed to testify? How does this work, legally speaking? Does a voicemail constitute a direction? And who is empowered to make such a direction in the first place in the State Department?
