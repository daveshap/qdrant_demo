I am a 24-year-old Software Developer who is a bit lost on which career path to take. Has anyone else experienced this, and if you have, can you please give some advice on what to do?
I have been a software developer for the past 2-3 years now. I graduated with an IT degree, which had a mix of business, project management, and software development courses. 

I would say that I’m good at my job - always being able to deliver features that are done correctly and on time, I am client-facing on a daily basis, and I even help with managing/delegating tasks from our client to our team sometimes. 

I like software development, and I love technology, but I don’t want to be a “code monkey” forever. I would like to establish a career where I get to be more involved with the product that we build and the technologies behind it, without having to be the one dealing with the day-to-day implementations of it. I feel that the longer I wait to switch my career path, the deeper I go into being stuck as a developer forever.

Having been exposed to several business and project management courses, and with my software development experience, what would be the most logical next step for me?

For a while now, I’ve been stuck on the thought of getting either a Project Management certificate, or pursuing an MBA (with some sort of specialization in Technology). I’m still unsure if either one of these would lead me to a role or career that I feel I’d be more passionate about.

I would like to know if any of you on Reddit have been in a similar situation, and what it is that you decided to do for your career. I’m also wondering what you’d do if you were in my situation. Thank you so much!
