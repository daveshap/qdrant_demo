I PRESENTED TODAY!!!
I was nervous and had an anxiety attack before class and on my way. I took deep breaths, got up there and DID IT! I was a little shaky, but I did it and I passed! I feel so accomplished today. I even went out of my comfort zone and raised me hand to answer a question in class when the rest of the students didn't. My answer was for the most part correct ... regardless i am still proud because i didn't have much knowledge on the topic !!! yay!

EDIT: Thank you all so much for the positivity and support. You've all put such an enormous smile on my face. I haven't smiled in a long time, since I just lost my fishy friend and got dumped recently, so again thank you!!! I appreciate every single one of you <3

EDIT: thank you for the silver kind stranger!!
