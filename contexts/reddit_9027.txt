It's election night again!  Just one state.  Polls close 9pm EST.

[Results page here](http://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/new-york)

A few discussion questions:

* [How will the 'rotten boroughs,'](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/19/republican-rotten-boroughs-primary-election-delegates) Congressional districts which get equal numbers of Republican delegates but which have very few Republicans in them, impact the primary?

* [How will the rules fight go down on the Republican side?](http://www.cleveland.com/rnc-2016/index.ssf/2016/04/republican_national_convention_2.html)  Particularly since many Trump delegates [may be faithless delegates who do not personally support him despite being pledged to vote for him](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/its-probably-first-ballot-or-bust-for-donald-trump-at-the-gop-convention/)

* How do [New York's strict voter registration rules](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/19/new-york-independent-voter-registration-frustration-sanders-democratic-primary) impact the vote on both sides?

**9:00 PM EST**  Polls closed.  NBC calling Trump as winner on Republican side.  No call yet on Democratic side.

**9:44 PM EST**  CNN just called the Democratic primary for Clinton.  Looks like we're getting about the night the polls projected we would.
