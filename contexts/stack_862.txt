Are there any commands I can use to ensure that the NTP service is running and is also responsive? Are there any commands I can use to ensure that the NTP service is running and is also responsive?What I am planning to do it have some monitory &amp; remediation scrip to ensure that a couple of services are running and are responsive and especially NTP. And if the service is not running or is not responsive then have it restart the service or check again, and if it still fails for 3 times send an alert email.Thanks in Advance!
