You wake up and spend 12 hours getting ready for the day, working, doing chores, etc. all so at the end of the day you can spend a measly 2 hours doing something you enjoy. Why?
I just don't get it and it's driving me nuts. The only reason I stick around is cause I feel too guilty killing myself, what with the few (and I mean few) loved ones I have. I mean, if there were a video game that was only enjoyable 20% of the time, and the other 80% it made you do work, would you play it? Would it be "worth it" to you? Of course not.

So can someone please tell me what makes it so different from life? I asked over on another subreddit and couldn't understand why any of them do it. Is anyone actually happy? Do the majority of people enjoy sitting in an office selling paper, as if they'd do it for free? I feel like they don't. Is this feeling I have truly a cause of depression? Or am I right? **Can someone please tell me why I'm wrong?**
