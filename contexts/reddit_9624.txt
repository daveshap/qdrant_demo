Advice Needed
I'm very interested in pursuing a career in Student Affairs, ideally as an undergraduate advisor. I currently work at a large university in an academic department, where I'm the office receptionist. I have had this job forever. 
I really want to advance my career though, and was wondering how I could best go about doing this. I've tried directly applying to jobs here, but have heard nothing back. Would anyone be willing to give me resume/cover letter help?

I'm thinking of going back to school, and ideally would like to do an online program, though I understand if it's better to be in a classroom environment so you can get practice within the field. 
I'm just tired of saying "I want to do this" and not doing anything because I don't know where to start. What should I be looking for in a program? How can I strengthen my resume? What skills should I develop so I can make some headway into my career choice?

I know this is reddit :) but I'm a true novice here. ANY advice would be helpful, even if it's just to tell me to go to another sub. 

Thank you!
