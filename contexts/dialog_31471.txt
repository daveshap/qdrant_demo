VICKI: You mean the time you're locked away?
WALTER: No. Prison is time. That's it. You think time, you feel time, you hear time. Your heart doesn't beat to live, it just beats... time.
VICKI: I'm sorry, Walter.
WALTER: Don't be sorry for me. I did those things. No one else did. I'm dealing with that.
VICKI: My father took me fishing here when I was a kid. He could name every fish in the lake. And for every fish he named, he had a fishing story. I hated fishing, but I loved his stories.
WALTER: Sounds like a special guy.
VICKI: My father was an alcoholic who drank himself right into the grave.
