Probability of getting a week off for vacation during first-year lab rotation?
I am starting my first year of grad school soon, in a research-heavy biology program. In the Fall, I have a chance to visit Alaska, which is something I have been wanting to do for years. But, this would require me to take a week off from my fall rotation (which is the first one). Rotations are 10 weeks total in my program.

I know it likely depends on the PI, but what do you think my likelihood of getting time off would be?

Side note: I will be enrolled in classes at this time too, so I would have to miss a week of classes. Feel free to comment on this aspect too!
