STEVE: You can't stay here. There's snakes and it's cold and you'll just get sicker.
ELAINE: I don't care.
STEVE: Suppose that Lednov was to have found you, instead of me. Why you wouldn't have had a chance.
ELAINE: I said I didn't care.
STEVE: What's botherin' you, anyway?
STEVE: Runnin' off and worryin' people. Makin' it tougher on Clay than it is already.
ELAINE: Don't ask me because I won't tell you! I won't tell anybody! Go away!
STEVE: Don't act so -- crazy.
ELAINE: I'm sorry. Let's go.
STEVE: That's a good girl.
