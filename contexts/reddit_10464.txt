No one will ever love me
No friends, no girlfriend and I doubt I'll get any. I get so little attention in my life that I seek some orange arrows and empty comments from strangers on the internet. I have nothing to live for. I just waste my life more and more everyday. I will never achieve anything, no one will miss me and I have no one to miss. I don't even like my family. 

My savings is my timer. I have been jobless for 6 months now, and once my savings are dried up I'm  going to kill myself. I've already tried killing myself before, but I will make sure to finish the job next time. I would rather be dead and continue living in this worthless life. I look forward to using the rest of my money, I find peace knowing I won't he here for much longer. I'm too tired to continue trying. 

So to the few of you that actually read this, good luck. You'll need it in this fucked up world. I hope you find a reason to live.
