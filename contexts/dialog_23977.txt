ELAINE: Viktor... I want to thank you for convincing Simone to sign with the studio.
VIKTOR: Don't thank me. It was entirely Simone's decision. Do you have Simone's check?
ELAINE: I don't have it on me. Anyway, it means a lot. Have you read the reviews? They're love letters. Listen to this one. Simone has the voice of a young Jane Fonda
VIKTOR: Almost right.
ELAINE: I can't wait to meet her.
VIKTOR: I don't know if that's going to happen.
ELAINE: Why not?
VIKTOR: As I say, she's... something of a recluse. That's how she's able to stay so pure -- by isolating herself in her art.
ELAINE: Don't be ridiculous. I arranged a press conference.
VIKTOR: Out of the question. A circus like that?
ELAINE: Viktor, it's my studio.
VIKTOR: She's my actor. There are other studios, Elaine. There's only one Simone. Leave the press conference to me.
