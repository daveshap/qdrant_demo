MARION: Then you explain it to me?!
HEARST: There's nothing to explain
MARION: A million dollars a year on art and st-st-statues and there's nothing to explain?!
HEARST: I will not defend my life to you--
MARION: I'm not asking you to defend anything. But we're in a pickle and we gotta talk about it.
HEARST: We are in no pickle" -- as you would euphemistically have it."
MARION: You gotta wake up now. Pops.
HEARST: There is nothing to discuss-
MARION: You don't have any money left, okay?! That's the truth. I don't wanna say it, nobody else will say it, but it's the truth. You spent it all. You can't buy the Tribune in Chicago -- you can't buy ^ g-g- goddamn thing. Now you better face up to it--
HEARST: You are being typically theatrical, Marion. I need the Tribune to--
MARION: You don't need it! That's the problem you always think you need everything--
MARION: That -- did you need that? How much did that cost?
HEARST: It's 12th Century. From Deauville -- in France.
MARION: I know where Deauville is for C-C-Christ's sake.
HEARST: You needn't use that language with me
MARION: Did you need it? Did you need any of it?
HEARST: I wanted it
MARION: There's a different between want and
HEARST: Not for me.
MARION: But why? Just so you can show it all off -- just so everyone can see what a b-b-big man you are?!
HEARST: That's right. You've captured me exactly. Goodnight.
MARION: You will not walk out on me
HEARST: You are repellant when you drink.
MARION: Tough shit. We need to t-t-talk about this--
HEARST: You are slovenly and unattractive and I won't t-t-t-tolerate it.
MARION: Fuck you, Mr. Kane.
HEARST: I will not have this in my home.
MARION: I just want to understand--
HEARST: No, you don't. You want to condemn me, like everyone else. You want to point to the pathetic, old man grown lunatic with his spending -- trapped in his ridiculous
HEARST: castle -- still fighting old battles he will never win with Pulitzer and Roosevelt and Hollywood--
MARION: I don't want you to--
HEARST: There is nothing to understand but this: I am a man who could have been great, but was not.
MARION: When I met him I was just 20. And he was 55. I saw the gold ring and just grabbed on. And he was going to make me a star.
CAROLE LOMBARD: And he did.
