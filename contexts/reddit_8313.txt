The United States Spends Twice As Much Per Capita On Healthcare Compared To Other Developed Nations. To Whom Is This Spending Going?
[Twice as much per capita.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_total_health_expenditure_per_capita) And spending, even for goods, ultimately is for labor so incomes/employment should be able to tell you the whole picture of spending.  So who are the workers - medical professionals, technology suppliers, insurers, government, researchers, etc. - that the US has more of or spends more on? Are providers/administrators getting paid more or are there more of them?  And for every one of these that does not account for twice as much per capita spending, the others must cost *over* twice as much to explain difference, right?

1. *Are doctor's just charging more?*:  [Looks like](https://journal.practicelink.com/vital-stats/physician-compensation-worldwide/), doctors in the US charge about 50% more than European doctors.

2. *Are there more total workers*  I suspect this is a major cause but its hard to get numbers .  [I see](http://www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/thenhs/about/Pages/overview.aspx) that the NHS in England employs 1.5 million people to cover a population of 54 million people. And [this site](https://www.bls.gov/spotlight/2009/health_care/) says about 11% of workers in the US are employed in private healthcare.  I can't find any direct comparison of number of public workers in other countries vs private workers in the US.

3. *Is the US providing more healthcare?* [We can look at quality...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_quality_of_healthcare) the US does have a better survival rate for cancer and heart disease.  But the life expectancy [isn't better](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_life_expectancy).  Does this imply the US *does not* spend more for end-of-life care?  [This](https://www.pennmedicine.org/news/news-releases/2016/january/cost-of-endoflife-care-in-the) says the US spends about 20% more than Belgium, England and Netherlands, but 20% less than Canada and Norway.  I can't find anything else conclusive so I don't know about this answer.  There are also fewer hospital beds per capita [(link)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_countries_by_hospital_beds) and fewer doctors per capita [(link)](http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/stats/Health/Physicians/Per-1,000-people) than many other countries.  [This very good article](http://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2015/oct/us-health-care-from-a-global-perspective) says the US does use more technology and drugs, but I can't tell how much of a cost this is.

4. *Does the US spend more on medical research?*  [This](https://www.quora.com/What-countries-have-lead-the-world-in-medical-research-and-innovation-in-the-past-20-years) seems to be a well researched answer but isn't per capita.  [This map](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/search/map) shows total clinic trials.  Europe has 740 million people so I get 1 trial per 11,000 people in Europe and 1 trial per 3500 people in the US.

5. (EDIT) *Administrative costs*  I meant for this to be included in 2 but I think I didn't look into this enough.  I'm seeing numbers that are more than double now that I'm looking at it more.  While [the NHS in England spends 14%](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/mar/30/nhs-management-costs-spending) on administrative costs, looks like the US spends 30%: [link](http://www.politifact.com/oregon/statements/2012/may/11/jennifer-williamson/do-we-really-spend-nearly-third-health-care-dollar/).  The discrepancy with Canada (in 1999) is even larger: [link](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa022033#t=article).  [But here's another link](http://www.mckinsey.com/industries/healthcare-systems-and-services/our-insights/accounting-for-the-cost-of-us-health-care) that's only got it 38% higher ($236B vs $145B).
