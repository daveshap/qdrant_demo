BATTY: Can't thank you enough, Mr. Sebastian. If you hadn't come along...
MARY: We were worried to death. It's awfully kind of you.
BATTY: We're not used to the big city. Where we come from it's not so easy to get lost.
MARY: You certainly have a nice place here.
BATTY: Well stocked.
PRIS: Sebastian doesn't like to go out too much.
SEBASTIAN: I keep a lot of provisions right here.
BATTY: I like a man who stays put. An admirable thing to be able to sustain yourself in these times. You live here all by yourself, do you?
SEBASTIAN: Well, no, not really. There's Mr. Deetchum, he's the watchman, he lives on the first floor.
