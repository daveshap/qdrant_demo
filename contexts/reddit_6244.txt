Do people start new jobs typically at the beginning of the next month in the US?
At the interview at a fintech company I was asked when I could start working for them. Since, I don't have a job at the moment, my answer was "immediately". They moved forward with me, and the HR lady asked me about my earliest start date. Since I want to finish some coursework I'm doing right now, I answered that i could start Monday in two weeks, which is 28th of October. 

I'm not a US citizen (I'm coming from Europe, this will be my first job in the US) and the notification period for leaving a job can be 1 to 3 months, so switching jobs typically does not take place under a month. 

Assuming that the company would have to do some paperwork and some internal setups, I assumed that two weeks would be a reasonable time frame. But now I'm concerned that my answer "immediately" and my gap of two weeks could be misinterpreted by the company. The whole interview process with them was quite quickly, so I guess they are a fast-moving company.

I know that the notification period for leaving a job in the US is typically two weeks and I'm wondering if that results in a "switching time" of two weeks. 

What do you typically answer to the question about the earliest start date given that you don't have any blocking responsibilities at the moment?
