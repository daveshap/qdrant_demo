Hoping things will go well, dating while fat.
I'm about to (in 5ish minutes) go on a date.  I'm a very heavy (250 lbs at average heigh) woman, and I'm sooooo nervous to put myself out there like this.  I have told the guy I'm seeing that I am heavy and he has seen photos of me, but I am definitely sucking it in, because of course.  

I am wearing my hair down, put on makeup, gonna wear jewelry and painted my toenails, basically trying to look my best, and I'm really hopeful things will go well.  I'm 39, never been married and just really hoping to meet a nice guy.  Fingers crossed!

UPDATE:  Thanks for all your kind and loving comments.  I am home from my date now and he and I have exchanged texts indicating interest in a 2nd date so I think it went well.  We walked around our local rose garden, which was romantic and we had a little talk, I kept it brief.  It was nice :D
