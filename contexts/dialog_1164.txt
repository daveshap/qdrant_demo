SALIERI: Where does he work?
LORL: In there, sir.
JOSEPH: Bravo, Mozart. Most charming. Yes, indeed. Clever man.
MOZART: Thank you, Sire!
VON SWIETEN: Well done, Mozart. Really quite fine.
MOZART: Baron!
MOZART: Majesty, may I ask you to do me the greatest favour?
JOSEPH: What is it?
MOZART: May I introduce my father? He is on a short visit here and returning very soon to Salzburg. He would so much like to kiss your hand. It would make his whole stay so memorable for him.
JOSEPH: Ah! By all means.
