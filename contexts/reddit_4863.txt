Feeling like an absolute pile of rubbish. Psychiatrist has put me on another pill.
From UK. Long story short been diagnosed with depression since 14. Cureently 29. GPs tried me on 8 different types of SSRIs in various dosages with and without benzos for anxiety. Been to many therapies and counselling sessions.
In 2014 i got really bad after the death of my nan who raised me. I was referred to a psychiatrist who i believe saved my life.
He rediagnosed me with unipolar treatment resistant depression with anxiety. He put me on a TCA called lofepramine at 240 mg a day. This is not what the pill is licensed for however he has found through his research thats when the medication works best. (Had a lot of gps having problems with prescribing me dosage because of it, even with a letter from him) it also has a short half life and as I was a suicide risk, it was the safest option.
Been on it for a while. This week he has prescribed me another TCA amitriptyline. I also am in weekly therapy (currently mindfulness)

Anyway, i just hate the fact i have to take pills. Everyone has their demons and one of mine is feeling weak for taking medication. And now i have to take another type. It makes me feel so shit, so incapable of functioning like a 'normal' human being. My self hatred is so high and I can't switch off the thoughts.

Guess i just wanted to see if anyone else is currently taking two types of antidepressants too and how they have been getting on?

Thanks and apologies for the extremely melodramatic post
