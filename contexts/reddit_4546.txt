Things are finally starting to look up
I finally took the plunge and I'm now on meds. Escitalopram to be exact. This is the best decision I ever could have made! If this is what it feels like to be normal, then I like normal. I'm not crying every night and I actually got out of bed this morning. I feel level. Kind of like a calm lake instead of my normal raging sea. It feels so good just to be balanced and able to function without a grey cloud sapping my emotions and making me unable to do anything. I can see light at the end of the tunnel and I'm enjoying finally feeling okay. I have had depression since I was about 8 and I became suicidal at age 10. After all these years, I am finally starting to be okay again. Sorry for the long post, I just felt like I had to share with someone who would understand. I know meds aren't for everyone and I'm in no way trying to push them on you guys, but they have helped me so much and I finally feel at peace.
