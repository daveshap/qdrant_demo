BELLA: What do you think of the guinea fowl?
ANNA: I'm a vegetarian.
BELLA: Oh God.
MAX: Having you here, Anna, firmly establishes what I've long suspected, that we really are the most desperate hot of under-achievers.
BERNIE: Shame!
MAX: I'm not saying it's a bad thing, in fact, I think it's something we should take pride in. I'm going to give the last brownie as a prize to the saddest act here.
WILLIAM: Bernie.
BERNIE: Well, obviously it's me, isn't it -- I work in the City in a job I don't understand and everyone keeps getting promoted above me. I haven't had a girlfriends since... puberty and, well, the long and short of it is, nobody fancies me, and if these cheeks get any chubbier, they never will.
