Dear Reddit, I am in need of someone with more experience than I.
I am in a bit of a pickle, and rather confused, if that is what you'd like to call it. I am not very, hmmm, knowing of all of these terms associated with the transgender, crossdressing community. (I haven't really looked up on it, mostly because I am ashamed that I will hurt my family)
Basically, here is my problem. I am a 16 year old young woman, but all of my life I have felt I want to be a boy! Not to uncommon, hence the subreddit I am deciding to post in. BUT. I still like guys. I have no desire to be with a woman, I still very much enjoy men. Very girlyish men you could say. I tend to find myself crushing on gay men especially, who have no desire to be with a woman at all.
It doesn't end there, either. I am currently with a man, who is 19 years old, and we have been together for 2 years. He does not know about my desire to be a boy, and I have held back from telling him because he is completely straight. When I say "be a boy", I want to keep my woman parts but dress as a boy, and identify as a boy. I need some advice reddit! As you could imagine, I have no one to talk to directly that I wouldn't be extremely embarrassed to admit this little problem I am in.
Thanks in advance, Reddit has always been helpful to me. (:
