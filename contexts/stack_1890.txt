Generic word for describing a tournament or league Im in the middle of designing my database schema and Im looking for a generic word to use for something that could be either a tournament or a league.ExamplesTournament - Fifa World Cup 2018League - Premier LeagueI have a generic database model where one column currently is named TournamentId, but it feels wrong using TournamentId on a League.What would be a more generic word, competition?
