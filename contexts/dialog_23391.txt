MARY: Well,then I have spoiled your dinner -- your food won't digest
JASON: You will have to make all the jokes, because I'm going to be very serious.
JASON: I'm going to find your sister.
GREGORY: I don't think that's a good subject for jokes, Mr. Hoag.
JASON: But I'm not joking.
GREGORY: Don't be ridiculous. For months I've had the best private detective in New York looking for Miss Gibson.
JASON: But I'm better than a detective. I have an understanding of people - and a love of them -- an understanding of the city - -
GREGORY: You don't even know Jacqueline Gibson.
JASON: But I understand her. That may be more important.
GREGORY: It may make very fine poetry, Mr. Hoag, but it doesn't make good sense.
JASON: Mary, when you first came here, I told you to look into your heart. You didn't listen to me. You listened to the policeman instead. You didn't find your sister, did you?
GREGORY: Look here, just because Mrs. Romari asked you to amuse us.
