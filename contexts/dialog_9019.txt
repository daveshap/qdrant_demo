JACK: Thank you, Betty. I know if I can just sleep this off, I’ll be fine...
MRS. PETERSON: And sleep you shall. Noblesse oblige is not dead. Not yet anyway...Come, let’s get you some help. Surely there must be a shelter somewhere in this city.
JACK: A shelter?! I’m the richest guy in the building...I’ve got twice the square footage you have!
FRANK: Whoa, whoa, whoa...hold it right there...
JACK: Frank. Where’s Alan Mintz? Is he here yet?
FRANK: Mr. Mintz? I don’t think so...building’s closed pal. You’ll have to come back tomorrow.
JACK: Look, I don’t know what’s going on here but I am Senior Vice President of this company.
FRANK: I don’t care who you are. It’s Christmas and like I told you the building is closed.
JACK: Maybe you’re not hearing me. I am Jack Campbell... Right here. Jack Campbell, President...
