SUSAN: Where's Joe?
PARRISH: Joe?
SUSAN: Where is he?
PARRISH: I don't know.
SUSAN: Because I was sitting in a staff meeting, incredibly bored, my mind kept wandering and the only place it landed was -- Joe.
PARRISH: I don't understand.
SUSAN: Love. Passion. Obsession, all those things you told me to wait for. Well, they've arrived.
PARRISH: This is crazy --
SUSAN: Why? A man appears at your side, almost never leaves it, you clearly trust him, depend on him, I sense you value him deeply, why aren't those things good enough for me?
PARRISH: You don't know anything about Joe --
SUSAN: What are you afraid of, Dad? That I'll fall head over heels for Joe -- well, I have -- as you did with Mom. That's always been standard, whether you like or not.
PARRISH: Susan, I don't think Joe is going to be with us long.
SUSAN: Where's he going?
PARRISH: I don't know, I can't say --
SUSAN: C'mon! The guy's working with you. You always know chapter and verse about everyone who works --
PARRISH: In this case, I can't. I - uh -- I just can't help you. I only would tell you -- that with Joe, you are on very, very dangerous ground.
SUSAN: I love him.
PARRISH: I don't care if you love him! I'm telling you he's no good for you!
