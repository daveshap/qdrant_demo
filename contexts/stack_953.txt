Remove garbage from Media/jw with command line While running f3write erroneously at first I left some garbage files in my Media/jw directory - 1.h2w and 2.h2w. How do I get rid of them?I can find them with the GUI but I don't have permission to remove anything there by deleting or dragging them to the trashcan.With the command line I don't know how to get to that location in order to use sudo.How do I cd above the Home directory using the command line?
