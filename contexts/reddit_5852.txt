Stay at my solid job or go back to school?
Graduated from undergrad this past December and I got a job in February. It isnâ€™t my ideal job but there is no stress and I genuinely like who I work with. It pays decent I guess for a first job and has good benefits. 

Shortly after starting work, I wanted to at least apply for grad school since this upcoming school year will be the most convenient time to go back. I applied and I got in, while being offered a Graduate Assistant position. This means I will not go into any debt.

The question is which choice do I make? Do I stay at this steady job? Or go back to school and take my chances elsewhere?
