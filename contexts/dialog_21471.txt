BUTTERCUP: On the high seas, your ship attacked, and the Dread Pirate Roberts never takes prisoners.
MAN IN BLACK: I can't afford to make exceptions. Once word leaks out that a pirate has gone soft, people begin to disobey you, and then it's nothing but work, work, work, all the time.
BUTTERCUP: You mock my pain!
MAN IN BLACK: Life is pain, Highness. Anyone who says differently is selling something. I remember this farm boy of yours, I think. This would be, what, five years ago?
MAN IN BLACK: Does it bother you to hear?
BUTTERCUP: Nothing you can say will upset me.
MAN IN BLACK: He died well, that should please you. No bribe attempts or blubbering. He simply said, Please. Please
MAN IN BLACK: I asked him what was so important for him. True love
BUTTERCUP: And what am I?
MAN IN BLACK: Faithfulness he talked of, madam. Your enduring faithfulness. Now, tell me truly. When you found out he was gone, did you get engaged to your prince that same hour, or did you wait a whole week out of respect for the dead?
BUTTERCUP: You mocked me once, never do it again -- I died that day!
