TENZIN GYATSO: I want to go down there.
NORBU THUNDRUP: You can only go with attendants and a big ceremony.
TENZIN GYATSO: I want to run down the street. I want to buy a toy. Eat from the shops.
NORBU THUNDRUP: You cannot.
TENZIN GYATSO: I want to be a shepherd, taking those goats and cows out to the hillside.
NORBU THUNDRUP: But you are not a shepherd, you are the Dalai Lama.
TENZIN GYATSO: Maybe in the next life, the world will not need a Dalai Lama.
NORBU THUNDRUP: I would not know. Maybe.
