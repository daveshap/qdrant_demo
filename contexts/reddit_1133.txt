DAE get messages from others that you are too anxious to read and then get anxious all over again the longer you don't reply?
Basically the title. I get so anxious opening work related (and in general too) messages/DM's because of the need to reply since the sender can see that you've read said message to the point of rarely opening them now. Well I feel great for a day and then my anxiety increases more and more the longer I wait to read the message. I'm to the point that I want to let someone else open all of my messages and relay the info to me, but some of the message chains have so many unread messages that I'm now afraid of just seeing/hearing bad news related to not opening the prior message that'll make me even more anxious. 

I'm in this inbetween area it feels like where I keep telling myself that tomorrow I'll open all of them so it subdues my anxiety a bit and this keeps going on daily. I literally have no valid excuse to tell these people either so I feel like I'm just intentionally screwing myself over and probably causing problems (that I haven't even read about yet in the unread messages).

I dug myself this hole and hate feeling anxious all the time from it, but also hate how I feel slightly less anxious just ignoring it.

Edit: Thanks everyone just for even replying, it strangely feels good to know that I'm not alone at all in feeling this way. Tomorrow I'm biting the bullet and going to go through all accounts (or what I can in the time I'll have) I can think of to reply to or delete messages and emails. Typed out a few replies for different situations that I'd been avoiding so I have no feasible excuse now! I'm bound to have a couple angry replies but I figure the quicker I reply the quicker I can sum up our conversation and never talk to them again! Thinking about it in that sense makes me just every so slightly excited to get rid of all the message baggage.
