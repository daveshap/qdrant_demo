Posting to Reddit is scary
I'm scared to post anything here. I can't count the number of times I've had an entire post/comment written out, and I delete it because I get scared. Getting downvoted is terrifying to me. If I have an opinion that might be umpopular, delete. It's not that I don't know how to express myself, I'm just scared to.
