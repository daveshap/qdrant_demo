How do you not compare yourself to others?
I was just viewing LinkedIn. Catching up on some old friends, and I just started a new job. Figured I should update my status to reflect my current situation in life 

It was better then my old one. But then I noticed my friends from university, whom I talked to, were a lot higher in tier and status then I am. Some were managers, others were senior associates, some stated their own company. I'm still entry level. 

Just made me feel bad. I'm not sure what to do.
