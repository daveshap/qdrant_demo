PSA from the SuicideWatch Mod Team: We're getting a lot of complaints about generic "uplifting" or "I love you" type posts and comments. Please read and follow guideline 4c in the sidebar.
We realise that most of the people who put up posts and comments of this nature want to help, and, if they haven't read the guidelines, it probably hasn't occurred to them that this might not be the right thing to do. But a) it's likely to backfire and b) there's no excuse for not reading the rules!

Responding to a suicidal person with messages like this (excerpted from a recent responder who we'll keep anonymous because they probably meant well):

>  You are not a failure. You are smart, you are young, you have an entire life to live. It is not impossible to become that person you want to be. You can be great.

is incredibly invalidating. If the person you're talking to were capable of believing that, they probably wouldn't be at serious risk for suicide.  And inflicting anything on them along the lines of "you can do anything you want" or "life is worth living", just disrespects their feelings and increases their sense of personal failure, because they can't do what you told them to do, believe what you told them to believe, or feel what you told them to feel.  As feeling like a failure and/or a burden is one of three most critical risk factors for death by suicide, it is not hyperbole to say that ***these so-called "empowering" messages kill people***.  

Guideline 4c links to [a previous PSA post](http://redd.it/1cep2h) that covers in more depth the reasons why this sort of "cheering-up" is absolutely against the rules here.  If you have any questions, please [shoot us a modmail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23SuicideWatch).

Our concerns aside, we are incredibly grateful to everyone who steps up and helps support our vulnerable OPs.  There's lots of stuff in the sidebar, especially [the talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) that we've put together to help you be more effective, and avoid dangerous intervention strategies.

**Edit:**  One other very dangerous type of message is "It gets better".  Because of the prominence of The Trevor Project and other similar initiatives, a lot of people seem to be coming to us with the idea that "It gets better" is not just an okay thing, but the *best* thing, to say to any suicidal person.  Nothing could be more wrong.  "It gets better" comes out of an initiative to reach LGBT youth who are being bullied and harassed in school.  And the getting better refers strictly to those behaviours, which *do* get better, on their own, with time, as people's peer groups get older.  It's a message intended to keep these kids from getting to the point where they're at risk for suicide.  But as a "hopeful" message for someone at risk, it's worse than useless.  First, it makes promises on behalf of the Universe - and the Universe may not keep them.  Second, it offers no understanding, but devalues or even trivializes their agony.
