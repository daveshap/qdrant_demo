GWEN: Only answers to me.
JASON: But I'm the Commander!
GWEN: On the show I talk to the computer and repeat what it says. So that's what they built.
JASON: C'mon, we're wanted up on the command deck.
GWEN: Wait. When are you going to tell them?
JASON: Tell them? About...
GWEN: Who we are. Don't you think they're going to be PISSED?
JASON: Are you kidding? I'm not going to tell them.
