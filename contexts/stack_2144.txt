Are there any user friendly ways to access screenshots taken on the Switch? I have an SD card on my console and have it set to store screenshots on the card.  But it doesn't seem like there's a way to view or otherwise extract those screenshots without having to pull out the SD card and use a reader to access them.  But this is not a desirable option since the Switch has to be turned off before removing the card.  Connecting the Switch to a (Windows) computer doesn't work, it's recognized as a USB device but nothing else.  I can't imagine how it would work if I didn't have an SD card.How else are we expected to access these screenshots?
