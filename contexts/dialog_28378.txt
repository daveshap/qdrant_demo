SNYDER: You the owner here?
BILLIE: That's right.
SNYDER: Lieutenant Snyder. Bunco.
BILLIE: Joliet badge, Snyder. Don't cut much up here.
SNYDER: I'm lookin' for a guy on the lam from a counterfeiting rap. Thought he mighta come in here.
BILLIE: Don't think so. I know everybody in the place and I always bounce the lamsters.
SNYDER: All right if I look around your lobby?
BILLIE: No, but you're welcome to a free beer before you go.
