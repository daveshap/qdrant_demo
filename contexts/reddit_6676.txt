would you email your HR manager on whether or not you are still going to be starting in August ?
o recently, i got a job offer with a company that is going to be starting in August. 

And as a college graduate, it is really hard for me to find a job right now. So i am banking on this job offer quite a bit. 

a few of the people who were going to start in June had their job offers rescinded but I got in touch with one of the recruiting people and they told me that my job offer still stands for I start in August. However, that was back in march. 

considering the outlook of what things are looking like, and the lack of communication that im now getting with the company, should i consider getting back in touch with her ?
