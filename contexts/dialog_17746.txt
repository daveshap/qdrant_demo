KAY: The hell happened?
COWAN: Hesitated, sir.
KAY: I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about your choice of targets.
KAY: You shot an eight year old girl.
COWAN: Uh... yes. Apparently I did, air.

COWAN: Well, I dunno. I mean, when you looked at all the other options... it just seemed sorta obvious.
KAY: Obvious? Why don't you and I have a little talk about the obvious... outside.
