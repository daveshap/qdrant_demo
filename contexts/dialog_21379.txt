STUCKEY: What's up, where you going?
EDWARD: Give me your car keys, will you, I'm going back to my hotel.
STUCKEY: At least stay for a drink. This party's for you.
EDWARD: Apologize to Elizabeth for me.
STUCKEY: Listen, there're some major local talent inside just dying to meet you...
EDWARD: Really? Some high class gold digger who speaks French better than I do? No, thank you. I just got off the phone with one.
STUCKEY: Cynthia's not coming?
EDWARD: No.
