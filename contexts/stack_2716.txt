Concept of contact angle, cohesive and adhesive forces I was reading the topic of contact angle from a book and I couldn't exactly understand it. The first photo depicts the general case when a solid surface touches a liquid surface. $Fs$ is the adhesive force and $Fl$ is the cohesive force and $F$ is the resultant of $Fs$ , $Fl$ and $W$ . I have understood this scenario and what all the above terms mean.Then it shows a case when the solid surface is just dipped in liquid so that it is not projected out and says $Fs$ will not longer be perpendicular to the solid anymore. Can somebody please tell me what this means? Can someone explain the difference in the two diagrams and their respective situations. What does ' If the solid surface is just dipped in liquid so that it is not projected out  ' mean and why is $Fs$ not PERPENDICULAR leading the change in contact angle?
