I feel like i ruined a friendship
I confess to one of my friends that I liked them. They didn't feel the same but I was ok with that cause I knew. But now I feel like they're distancing themselves from me. They keep on making excuses to not hang out. I don't know if I'm overthinking things or I should just look at things at face value.
