ALEX: This is where it happened. Right over here.
ERIN: Yeah, I know.
ALEX: Are you ok?
ERIN: When Lauren was missing the police came to our house. They said they were looking for her, right? But I know now they had her, and the reason they brought her here and knew the could blame it on you...
ALEX: No...
ERIN: ... is that I sent them here. I told them she came here sometimes. With her dirtball boyfriend. That's exactly what I said.
ALEX: Erin. It's not your fault.
ERIN: It's all my fault. Oh God. I wish I were dead.
ALEX: No. You don't.
ERIN: Yes I do, I really do.
