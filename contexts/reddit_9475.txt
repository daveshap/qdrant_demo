I’ve managed to save $1000.
It’s in a savings account that I’m pretending doesn’t even exist. However, I have some debt. But I’m doing well paying more than the minimum. I also have a car that could use some work. So, am I doing the right thing by leaving it alone? Or, should I pay off the debt and/or fix the car? (The car is safe to drive, but could use some new tires and general maintenance.)
