RAY: Shhh... It's okay.
BRENDA: Ray, have you been here all this time?
RAY: I just wanted to make sure you were okay.
BRENDA: I'm fine. Just a few bruises.
RAY: So, I guess I can go now.
BRENDA: No, stay.
RAY: You sure?
BRENDA: Yeah, I think I'll feel better sleeping in the arms of a strong man.
RAY: Yeah, me too.
