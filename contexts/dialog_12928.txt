KEVIN: You gotta pee?
JENNIFER: I don't see why you can't just lock me in. It's not like I can go anywhere.
KEVIN: Either I'm going to tie you or Mars will tie you. Which do you want?
JENNIFER: Thanks for the shirt.
KEVIN: Whatever.
JENNIFER: Kevin, my father needs a doctor.
KEVIN: He's just knocked out. I've been knocked out.
JENNIFER: If my father dies they'll charge you with his murder. Can't you make Dennis see that?
