I am socially awkward and can’t tell a girl I like her
I am a 16 year old male, a junior in high school 

Well to be short I am extremely socially awkward and always have trouble telling a girl I like her.

Once I liked a girl for 9 years and never told her anything.

It’s easier for me to make friends than to tell a girl that I like her

I honestly don’t know what to do. I am honestly thinking about asking my friend to tell her for me.

What should I do?

TL;DR: I am socially awkward and can’t tell a girl I like her
