JOE: Okay ramblers, let's get to rambling. Wait a minute, who didn't throw in?
MR. ORANGE: Mr. Pink.
JOE: Mr. Pink? Why?
MR. ORANGE: He don't tip.
JOE: He don't tip? You don't tip? Why?
MR. ORANGE: He don't believe in it.
JOE: He don't believe in it? You don't believe in it?
MR. ORANGE: Nope.
JOE: Shut up! Cough up the buck, ya cheap bastard, I paid for your goddamn breakfast.
MR. PINK: Because you paid for the breakfast, I'm gonna tip. Normally I wouldn't.
JOE: Whatever. Just throw in your dollar, and let's move. See what I'm dealing with here. Infants. I'm fuckin' dealin' with infants.
