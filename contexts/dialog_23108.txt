JOEL: Have they questioned you yet, Sid?
SIDNEY: This has nothing to do with me, Joel. There's an estimated 270 serial killers currently active in the US at any given time. I can't control that. Who's hungry?
HALLIE: I have rehearsal.
MICKEY: I have to watch rehearsal.
JOEL: I gotta hit the library. Anatomy. Some of us have real majors. You gonna be okay, Sid?
SIDNEY: You're not allowed to ask that.
JOEL: I'll stop by the Deltas tonight.
SIDNEY: Thanks, Joel.
