Looking for Job search advice!!
I guess this is as good a place as any to put this.  I was wondering if anyone knew of some good jobs that may be around my area.  I live in Colorado Springs, CO and have recently been laid off.  So I was curious if anyone knows of job openings in their community or workplace.  I would be willing to travel 50 miles in any direction.  Before anyone asks, I do not have a degree yet, although I am 12 credits away from my associates.  I know that means squat until I actually get the degree, but I just wanted to show everyone that I am working towards something.  I have no trade skills, but a long work history.  I would prefer to make $13 to $14 dollars an hour just to sustain myself but obviously there will come a time when I won't be able to be picky.  It took me 8 years to get to the level financially I was at before with a company.  I have applied to many many places and only a few callback and 2 interviews with no success.  Even if you live out of my state, maybe you know of something near me.  Also does anyone know how much unemployment is in Colorado.  I know it's a percentage of your income but I don't know how much.  Thanks to all in advance.
