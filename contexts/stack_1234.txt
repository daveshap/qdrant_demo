is vertical scaling good idea for a mysql database server? I operate a mariadb/mysql database server and i do not want to get into the problems with managing a multi-cluster database serveri have access to huge CPU and RAM and STORAGE when neededso my question to the experienced and expert db admins is that is vertical scaling good enough? yes downtime is ok as long as data is protected I rather deal with downtime of some system failure or issue that will only happen very rarely...it is better than the headache with managing a multi-cluster database to meso what are the bottlenecks i will run into running a database up to 512GB memory and like 128vCPU? and like 2TB of SSD storage?how is this worse than lets say running like a 8 cluster of mariadb/mysql database with each 64GB memory, 16vCPU and 256GB SSD storage?yes i know about iops but i mean with lots of redis caching i think one can reduce stress on that part as wellpretty much there is more and more powerful CPU and servers that one can pack lots of stuffs in a single machine..not like years ago where that was not possible or at least easy..now one can pack several Terabytes, TBs(not a typo) of memory in a single machineplease send your advice and tipsthanks!!!
