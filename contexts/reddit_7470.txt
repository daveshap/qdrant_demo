I am utterly intimidated by my supervisor and can't function after a meeting with him
I'm weeks away from submitting my final PhD thesis. I (30F) have been under his supervision for about 5 years now, but I am still so intimidated by him. I am generally not a shy or underconfident person, but whenevr I walk into a meeting with him, I am panicked. If he asks me a question, I can hardly answer it. I freeze because I feel like I can never get it right. The tiny gaps in my knowledge convert to vast crevices in my head. I feel completely powerless since he always controls the tone of our conversation. I never feel like this with anyone else. 
I understand that academia is about being challenged and criticised but how do you deal with criticism? It's hard for me to not think less of myself. And I hate that feeling worthless. The standards are too high and it's killing my self esteem. 
I need some advice on how to navigate the final few weeks of my PhD.
