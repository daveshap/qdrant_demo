Luggage type for short, frequent business trips I am going to have a lot of short (1-2 days/1 night) business trips. I will fly one or two segments in the morning and come back next evening on a symmetrical route. I am pondering what would be the best type of luggage to buy for this kind of use case. Luggage must be taken into cabin and be as lightweight as possible.The options are:Weekender 30-40 litersBackpack 30-40 liters (has also to accommodate a laptop)Troller (30 liters) + messenger (15 liters)What would be the most practical one in this situation?
