Sanders received 60% of in-person votes in Maricopa County. How much would the state have swung if there hadn't have been so many issues with voting?
I did some calculations here based off of the Maricopa county site's info: http://i.imgur.com/VawxEoX.jpg

Do you think given this information there would have been a significant swing one way or the other had there not been so many issues with voting?
