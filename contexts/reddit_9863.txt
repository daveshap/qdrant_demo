Transitioning from Small School to Fairly Large
I oversee Campus Activities. As a grad student, I worked at a small private school of around 4,000 people. Now, for the past year, I've worked at a state junior college with even less people, and only about 300 residential students. The place I'm at is not a good fit for me, in terms of both culture and setting. I'm looking to leave and want to apply to some larger schools (around 18,000 students).   
Despite my best effort and a lot of after-hours time spent working on programs and events (cleanup, setup, etc), most events just don't go well. I know in my brain a lot of that is because of our dwindling financial resources and because I'm literally a one-man show, and also the student culture (very few students want to even attend events, much less put forth any effort into providing programs). But I can't help chalking it up to some extent as a failure on my part. And the thought of leaping into a much larger pool terrifies me, as if I can't succeed at a small institution, I feel like I'll drown and just disappoint students at a larger school where there's so many more people to account for and keep up with.   
So I guess my question is, to those who have made similar transitions, how have you dealt with any fear related to it? Small schools are all I've known, and I'm terrified I'll be thrown into another one-man show situation at a bigger institution.
