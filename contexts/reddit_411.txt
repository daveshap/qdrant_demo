I need help
I am a 4 foot 10 inches 7 grader who loves basketball. I think I am too short to play because I get blocked every time. I am going to quit basketball soon because of this. I do not want to quit but the game is not as fun as I used to play it. I started basketball 7 years ago and it has been my favorite sport. What should I do
