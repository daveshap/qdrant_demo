Unsure about Unpaid Internship at Unlaunched Startup (could lead to a job?)
I got offered an unpaid internship at a startup by the founder whom I got to know through tutoring his kid. However, I'm  unsure whether this is a legitimate opportunity worth getting involved with, or not.

**Offer:**  
Unpaid internship. After the launch (in a couple months, trying to find investors), would lead to "part time or full time."

**Job Description:**  
Data collecting, product testing, maybe email marketing, maybe operations. Basically a generalist I guess. It sounds like there could be a LOT of flexibility depending on my interest, and probably need.

**Concerns:**

1. He's a self-described serial entrepreneur. But he comes from the finance world so he's started advising groups and whatnot, but no ... startups? Does that make sense? And he says he already has one that's paying for itself (can't tell if that means breaking even or profits), but I can't find anything about it online.  
So **unverified, or unverifiable, history of entrepreneurship**.
2. I know that generally "unpaid internships" are illegal. If anyone does work to benefit the company they need to get paid. If I take this on, the job description sounds like I should be getting paid.  
Plus, there isn't anyone to learn from which is what interning is about. If I'm figuring things out on my own that's an employee. So I take **problems with both "unpaid" and "internship"**.
3. I don't know how long I'll have to wait until funding then converting to part/full time. Maybe it'll only be a couple months like he said but there's no guarantee. Also, what if I get hired but the offer is too low to accept? I'll have worked free for months with no job at the end. Does that mean I have to discuss my future possible salary *now,* before accepting the internship? **A solid job in the near future is not guaranteed**.
4. Originally I wanted to join a mid-size startup that's in growth stage. I have no special skills (a.k.a. not a software engineer) but that's all the more reasons so I can learn a lot and fast. I'm afraid that if I do this, **couple years later I won't have much to show for** in terms of both specialized skill/career and company recognition (90% of startups fail, after all).

Here are a few reasons why I'm considering it.

* One is that he says there are engineering teams for each company. They may be small but if there's a team I feel like it must be legit. I've also briefly met 2 non-engineers working for him, so that shows there are *real* people working on these (even if they're young & inexperienced).
* He doesn't seem like he's fiscally struggling. He's been regularly paying me for tutoring. His finance side could be floating all of his startups BUT maybe his prior startup really is "paying for itself" and his other ventures are working out as well. Obviously he's doing something right even if it weren't his startups.
* I'm interested in startups which is why he gave me this offer in the first place when he found out. It could be a great experience if it goes well. I'm also a grad looking for jobs so just any work that could add to my resume is nice.

**Options**

I could take it and maybe get a good reference and a line on my resume out of it, while still applying to other things. But in that case, I'd be doing work for free.  
I could take it and wait to get converted to FT and become an early employee of a new startup. In that case I want a guaranteed FT with fair compensation, which I don't know what is. But I don't have enough information to make a comfortable decision.

I'm going to have a meeting with him next week to discuss more about what I'd be doing, and would like to have some answers by then. Am I worrying myself too much? Or is everything a total red flag? I've no idea.   
I appreciate any advice or insight.
