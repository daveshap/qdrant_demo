There’s a big Kyle MacLachlan cardboard cutout looming over my bed, should I get rid of it?
Alright so I’ve been seeing this girl and we’re gonna have sex in a couple days for the first time together. I was wondering if I should get rid of this life sized cardboard cutout of Twin Peaks star Kyle MacLachlan in my room. It’s positioned so that he’s staring right at whoever’s in the bed. I put it there I like having Agent Cooper watch over me while I sleep, but that’s irrelevant. Do you think Kyle would be off putting for her? Would it be a turn off? Does Paul Atreides make you horny? Please help the clock is ticking.
