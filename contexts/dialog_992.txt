KAREN: So there you are. It seemed odd, suddenly, your not being there...
EVE: Why should you think I wouldn't be?
KAREN: Why should you be? After all, six nights a week - for weeks - of watching even Margo Channing enter and leave a theater-
EVE: I hope you don't mind my speaking to you...
KAREN: Not at all.
EVE: I've seen you so often - it took every bit of courage I could raise-
KAREN: To speak to just a playwright's wife? I'm the lowest form of celebrity...
EVE: You're Margo Channing's best friend. You and your husband are always with her - and Mr. Sampson... what's he like?
KAREN: Bill Sampson? He's - he's a director.
EVE: He's the best.
KAREN: He'll agree with you. Tell me, what do you between the time Margo goes in and comes out? Just huddle in that doorway and wait?
EVE: Oh, no. I see the play.
KAREN: You see the play? You've seen the play every performance? But, don't you find it - I mean apart from everything else - don't you find it expensive?
EVE: Standing room doesn't cost much. I manage.
KAREN: I'm going to take you to Margo...
EVE: Oh, no...
KAREN: She's got to meet you-
EVE: No, I'd be imposing on her, I'd be just another tongue-tied gushing fan...
KAREN: There isn't another like you, there couldn't be-
EVE: But if I'd known... maybe some other time... I mean, looking like this.
KAREN: You look just fine... ... by the way. What's your name?
EVE: Eve. Eve Harrington.
