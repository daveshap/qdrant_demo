Hey suicide watch family, im just checking in :)
The homeless shelter has been going very nicely, this new city I'm staying in has many kind donators who keep us fed and clothed.



The shelter assigned me a case manager that will help me stay on track and focused toward getting on my feet and helping me get my own apartment.


Ive met some very interesting people, and they all have been very friendly towards me so far.
We all like to hangout and chit chat in this garden and also watch Court cases together :p


Love love love you guys.
