Was Birgitte Silverbow remembering herself? Given the cyclical nature of the The Wheel of Time, it seems inevitable that everything has occurred before at some point. When Birgitte Silverbow finds herself<blockquote class=\"spoiler\">   ripped from Tel'aran'rhiod by Moghedien and bonded as Elayne's warder,</blockquote>she says the following:<blockquote>  \"A Warder,\" Birgitte said slowly. \"I think I remember hearing a tale  of a female Warder, but it was in a life so long ago that I cannot  remember more than that.\"</blockquote>The Age of Legends did not have Warders, and the Forsaken stated that they did not even understand how the unique link worked. Therefore, it would seem that Birgitte is remembering something from a far-distant Age. Has Robert Jordan or anyone else 'official' commented on whether or not Birgitte is remembering herself.. that is, her current iteration from before?
