LOUISE: Not this weekend, sweetie, she's runnin' away with me. Hi. What'd he say?
THELMA: What time are you gonna pick me up?
LOUISE: You're kiddin'! Alright! I'll be there around two or three.
THELMA: What kind of stuff do I bring?
LOUISE: I don't know. Warm stuff, I guess. It's the mountains. I guess it gets cold at night. I'm just gonna bring everything.
THELMA: Okay. I will, too.
LOUISE: And steal Darryl's fishin' stuff.
THELMA: I don't know how to fish, Louise.
LOUISE: Neither do I, Thelma, but Darryl does it, how hard can it be? I'll see you later. Be ready.
