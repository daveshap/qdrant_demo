I just made the final payment of my balance owed to my landlord today and I’m glad to say I won’t get kicked out of my apartment!
Oh boy, what a crazy year 2019 has been! Lost my father, whom I couldn’t see because of my immigration situation, stopped working for a while, racked huge debts (4000$ for rent ALONE), it has been a crazy journey and a steep climb for me to be able to repay my rent owed, getting letters from debt collectors and calls at 6 am from my landlord but I made it. I have been working everyday 12 hours + and i have repaid a big portion of my debts over the last few month, now all is left is my credit card balance which i’m going to drastically improve within the next couple of months. I’m so motivated and i know that i will get back on my feet and start actually saving and investing into my future!
