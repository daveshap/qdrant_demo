Do the 'Smash' or 'Massacre' perks affect the Eviscerator's primary, alt and bash attacks? The Eviscerator differs from the other Berserker melee weapons as it has no separate 'light' and 'hard' melee attacks, but a projectile and a melee attack instead. Do the 'Smash' or 'Massacre' perks affect the Eviscerator's attacks (projectile, melee chainsaw and bash)? How do those perk skills affect those attacks?Smash:<blockquote>  Hard attacks with perk melee weapons do 50% more damage, do 25% more  damage on head hits, and have 200% more stumble power.</blockquote>Massacre:<blockquote>  Light attacks with perk melee weapons do 30% more damage and all  attacks with perk melee weapons are 5% faster.</blockquote>Specifically I would like to know if the following apply to any of the Esciverator's attacks:Smash and Massacre's damage bonusSmash's headshot bonus damageSmash's stumble power bonusMassacre's attack speed bonus
