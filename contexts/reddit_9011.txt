What's caused Japan's, Canada's and Australia's sudden drop in press freedom?
I've been looking at the [Press Freedom Index on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_Freedom_Index) and then started scrolling down through the list to see how countries changed over time. Then noticed a huge drop for Japan from #11 to #52 onwards. 

A similar thing was noticed in Australia as well (Dropped from #18 in 2012 to #30 suddenly) and Canada most recently (#10 to #18).

So what's caused all these drops in Press Freedoms for these specific countries?
