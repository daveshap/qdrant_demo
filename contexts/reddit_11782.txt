I'm fucking pathetic!
God I'm fucking pathetic! I'm 17 and a couple months ago I made the decision to stop going to public school and start doing homeschool. This cost my parents a decent amount of money. I couldn't bring myself to go to school in the morning, I couldn't bring myself to do anything I was so depressed I didn't want to get out of bed. I just wanted to sit on the computer all day, I had fucking no one at school anyways so I decided to try home school. 

Well that was 4 months ago and I haven't left the house in 2 and a half months or so. I'm so depressed, I've never been this depressed. I haven't been doing my school work lately so my parents grounded me from the computer, this just made things even worse for me and I've spent the last week in bed beating myself up. I'm so fucking lazy, I have 0 motivation. I can't even bring myself to cut myself like I usually do when I'm this depressed.

I haven't gotten a haircut since school started, I don't shower as often as I should, I have wisdom teeth that need to be taken out, I have cavities that need to be fixed, I need to go to the eye doctor to get more contacts and I need to go the doctor to get different medication because it's obviously not fucking doing anything for me. 

I'm pathetic and everything wrong in my life is my fault, I'm just a failure and I need to die. 

(I know this wall of text isn't really organized or anything and I'll be surprised if anyone really reads all of this pointless shit, but thank you if you did... there's just no one else I can really talk to)
