UNCLE BILLY: There you are, Ted-baby. Everything all right?
TED: Yeah. Everything's cool.
UNCLE BILLY: You ready for your big coming out party? Everybody's dying to meet you.
TED: Just a couple of finishing touches. My parents always said you never get a second chance to make a good first impression.
UNCLE BILLY: They said that? Really? Oh, your parents. The Nelson's. Right, right. How midwest. I like that.
TED: Truth is, I'm a little nervous.
UNCLE BILLY: YOU? Nervous? Why on earth should you be nervous?
TED: All those people out there. It's a lot of pressure.
UNCLE BILLY: Huh! You laugh in the face of pressure!
TED: I do?
UNCLE BILLY: You are a multi-media magnate. The Tycoon of Tits. The Baron of Bottoms.
