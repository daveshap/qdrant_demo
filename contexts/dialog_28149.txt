LOMBARD: I doubt Friedman ever even met Leon, Deborah. Friedman dealt with select customers. As for my envelope, had he know where it was he wouldnâ€™t have mistaken me for a hitman called Lamont when we met in Los Angeles.
DEBORAH: ...You-you spoke to him?
LOMBARD: Not in the strict sense of the word, no. He was in too much of a hurry to kill me when we first met and too wasted in acid when I caught up with him later.
