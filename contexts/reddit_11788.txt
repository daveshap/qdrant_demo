I cant even cant even go shopping without going into full depression and beating myself down
I just went shopping for some sunglasses. I didn't think any of them looked good, or maybe I just dont like the way I look. I dont like anything about myself. Everything is bad. I usually feel this way. I hate myself and its so exhausting feeling so defeated.
