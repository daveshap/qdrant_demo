acne problems
i have a lot of acne and acne scars for years now, i get made fun of and i have lost all confidence to meet new people and talk to girls. I get called names like pizza face and the moon's surface. Some people have said it will go eventually, but it really hasn't. I have been to the doctors, been on antibiotics, tried everything in the shops, changed my diet. It just does not work
