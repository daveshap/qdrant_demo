Why does standard model lose predictivity if it has unstable vacuum? In String Theory In A Nutshell by Elias Kiritsis, <blockquote>  Standard Model is unstable as we increase the energy (hierarchy problem of mass scales) and the theory loses predictivity as one starts moving far from current accelerator energies and closer to the Planck scale.</blockquote>How is predictivity related to instability of higgs vacuum? Is this about QFT predictions done perturbatively, such that we cannot describe particles in middle of transition? Or something else?In any case my question was confusing: it is just asking why we have predictivity problems when we have an unstable model.
