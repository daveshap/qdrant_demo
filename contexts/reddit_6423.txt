If a company tells you they're like a family, is that a red flag?
If you're in an interview, and you ask them about the culture of the company, and they say they're "like a family" and "no office politics", is that a red flag?

In my experience, there is no such thing as a company that's "like a family", and if they're like my family, there will be constant arguing.
