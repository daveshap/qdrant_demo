How to update php without breaking dependencies [Lamp] Im currently running PHP Version 5.5.9-1ubuntu4.20 on ubuntu 14.04I want to update to php 7.1.10 but im not sure how to do it.Im also running mysql and phpmyadmin which I dont want to break.Are there important things to keep in mind so everything keeps working? When updating things im always scared to break dependencies is this a realistic fear or shouldn't I worry about it?
