ALICE: So, should I call Andy?
PETE: Andy?
ALICE: That's his name... Andy. Our ticket out of here.
PETE: Yeah. Call him.
ALICE: I'll set it up for tomorrow night. You'll meet me at his place at eleven o'clock... Don't drive there... Take a bus... Make sure no one follows you... His address is easy to remember... It's 2224 Deep Dell Place... It's a white stucco job on the south side of the street... I'll be upstairs with Andy... The back door will be open... That leads into the kitchen - go through the kitchen to the living room - there's a bar there... At eleven fifteen, I'll ask Andy to fix me a drink... When he does, you can crack him in the head... Okay?
PETE: Okay...
ALICE: Lemme call him now. Make sure he's not already busy tomorrow night.
PETE: Okay.
