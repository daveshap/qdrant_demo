Anyone here taken an apprentice job before?
I'm thinking of applying for one in the logistics/supply chain field. The program is 1-2  years depending on the company. Both require four year degrees which I have. I have no relevant work experience in the field of logistics/supply chain, so I'm guessing this is the best way.
