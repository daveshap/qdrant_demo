TORQUIL: You're resourceful, my lad. I tell you, one year under my tutelage and I could make you the Prince of Thieves.
COLWYN: Subject to the King, no doubt.
TORQUIL: Naturally.
TORQUIL: A good thrust, my friend. Another second and there'd have been nothing between my head and shoulders but bad memories.
COLWYN: I intend to keep you alive, your majesty. So you can abdicate your throne and become my Warlord.
TORQUIL: Perhaps. If the pay is good.
