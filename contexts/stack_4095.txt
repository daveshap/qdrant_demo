Can you fill the printed customs form to save time in Canadian airports? At least in Vancouver Airport one has to spend a lot of time to get to the electronic customs declaration kiosks. This got me thinking - is it possible to fill out the paper based customs declaration (form E311) instead (saved up from a previous overland trip) instead of using the electronic version? One could then skip the first queue and directly stand in line for the immigration officers. If it matters, I'm a Canadian resident who is not a US/Canadian citizen.
