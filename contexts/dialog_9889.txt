FRANCES: What's up?
CLURMAN: I hear you're meeting with the studio lawyers to get out of your contract.
FRANCES: That's right. I don't want them breathing down my neck while we're in London.
CLURMAN: Well... well, you see, that's the point. You won't be opening in London.
FRANCES: You don't think I'm good enough?
CLURMAN: What?! Good Lord no, it's just... It's money. We needed backing and... well, we found it.
FRANCES: Who?
CLURMAN: An actress.
FRANCES: A rich actress.
CLURMAN: Yes. That's the deal. She plays Lorna.
FRANCES: But... but wait a minute. We're supposed to be different, right? Clifford says... This theatre is supposed to be different! And this play... this play is all about what greed and money do to people!
CLURMAN: I know, but --
FRANCES: What does Clifford say?
CLURMAN: Right now we have to be practical.
FRANCES: Does Clifford even know? You didn't tell him, did you? I'm gonna tell him. Where is he?
CLURMAN: He knows, Frances.
