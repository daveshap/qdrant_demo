DAVID: Say that again, son.
DOCTOR: I beg your pardon?
DAVID: I said say that again, son - because the next time you do, I'll make sure you're in there with my daughter, but in a slightly less healthy state and she's in a coma with a broken arm right now.
DOCTOR: I'm er ... sorry if you've been waiting a long time.
DAVID: We have. In fact, we've been sitting here since the start of the Millennium and I'd really like some action from you before the end of the world.
DAVID: So, why not haul your ... nice little ass into this room and explain to me and my wife why our precious daughter is going to be absolutely fine because of all the fantastic intelligence and attention you are going to give her case.
DOCTOR: Okay, sir. Certainly. Good.
