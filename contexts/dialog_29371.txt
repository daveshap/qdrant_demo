WOODY: Oh, come on, Buzz. I...Buzz, I can't do this without you. I need your help.
BUZZ: I can't help. I can't help anyone.
WOODY: Why, sure you can, Buzz. You can get me out of here and then I'll get that rocket off you, and we'll make a break for Andy's house.
BUZZ: Andy's house. Sid's house. What's the difference.
WOODY: Oh, Buzz, you've had a big fall. You must not be thinking clearly.
BUZZ: No, Woody, for the first time I am thinking clearly. You were right all along. I'm not a Space Ranger. I'm just a toy. A stupid little insignificant toy.
WOODY: Whoa, hey -- wait a minute. Being a toy is a lot better than being a Space Ranger.
BUZZ: Yeah, right.
WOODY: No, it is. Look, over in that house is a kid who thinks you are the greatest, and it's not because you're a Space Ranger, pal, it's because you're a TOY! You are HIS toy.
BUZZ: But why would Andy want me?
WOODY: Why would Andy want you?! Look at you! You're a Buzz Lightyear. Any other toy would give up his moving parts just to be you. You've got wings, you glow in the dark, you talk, your helmet does that -- that whoosh thing -- you are a COOL toy.
