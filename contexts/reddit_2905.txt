Is it a valid reason to resign due to a toxic work environment?
My manager has never had an issues with my performance or attendance. I have stayed with the department because it is in the industry related to my career interests, the job market is rough and I needed experience.


I am exhausted from being targeted by co workers and working in an environment where I'm made sure everyday that I am not welcome. I filed a harassment complaint with HR and everyone was required to complete workplace harassment training. I am tired of documenting.

Management is rejecting my requests to become part time or taking leave of absences. I cannot continue to work in a poisoned environment. I don't have another job ready (even though it would be ideal). 

I hate that there will be a gap in employability and
its obvious that I have to leave but I'm hesitant:
- should I state my reason for leaving due to toxic environment (edit: lack of fit), detailing everything I've done to resolve the situation without any luck. 
- would management and hr provide references for my future employment?

Edit: Thank you everyone for your insight. I did what was best considering my circumstances. This is a learning experience in my career development, I'm also networking and also learning from other experienced professionals as well as upgrading my skills.
