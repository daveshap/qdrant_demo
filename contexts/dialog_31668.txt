GIBBONS: You did say Ahab"? You're sure about that?"
XANDER: Yeah, I sent you pictures. Here's what I'm thinking. If they take out the cameras and sensors, they could probably put a bomb in this thing. You drop it in the water in the Red Sea and three weeks later it's swimming up the Potomac.
GIBBONS: This is good work, X, damn fine work. You need to press on at all costs, find out what they have planned with this Ahab"."
XANDER: Hey, one miracle at a time. They're on to me now, remember?
GIBBONS: I'm gonna be en route with a team shortly to relieve you. Just keep the pressure on until the cavalry arrives. And X? You done yourself proud helping those people today.
XANDER: Thanks.
GIBBONS: You're a grungy little phoenix, you know that? Keep up the good work.
XANDER: You ain't seen nothing yet.
