Does the Linux kernel source code contain device drivers? I have been interested in kernel development for a while. What I am wondering is whether the kernel source code contains any code about the hardware components. In other words, are device drivers part of kernel source code?If they are part of kernel source code, how can it be possible?By using a virtual machine or dual boot, we can set up Linux in any computer. How does Linus Torvalds write it to be compatible with all computers and their hardware components?I think that device drivers are not part of the kernel.
