PARKER: What's the problem?
MADISON: I'm doing the best I can!
COX: ... illegal search of Lindenmeyer' s duplex. Eleven civilian vehicles damaged or destroyed. Twentyâ€”four citizen complaints. And the calls are just starting to come in... I forgot what it's like to have you on the streets.
MADISON: Any sign of Lindenmeyer?
COX: None. He could be hiding, he could be helping Sid, or could be in little pieces on Santa Monica beach. Any idea what Sid's going to do next?
MADISON: Until we know what new influences are affecting him, we can't be sure.
COX: In other words, we collectively don't know shit.
WALLACE: It makes me nervous just seeing him in a uniform. I will never forget the first time I saw the photos from the crime scene.
DEANE: Neither will the public. The media has caught wind of his pardon. Unless Mr. Barnes starts giving me some tangible results, I'm going to put him back in his cage.
