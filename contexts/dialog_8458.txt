ROSS: Oh, hey -- lemme give you a hand there.
ERIN: Thank you very much. Aren't you a gentleman? Mr. ...
ROSS: Ross.
ERIN: Ross. Real pleased to meet you. I'm Erin.
ROSS: Erin. Cool. What can I do for you, Erin?
ERIN: Well, believe it or not, I am on the prowl for some water records.
ROSS: You come to the right place.
ERIN: I guess I did.
ROSS: You just tell me what you want to look at and I'll be glad to dig 'em out for you.
ERIN: I wish I knew. It's for my boss. He's fighting his water bill, and he wants me to find all manner of bills from all kinds of places. The easiest thing would probably be if I just squeezed back there with you and poked around myself. Would that be okay?
ROSS: Heck, yeah. Come on back. Just gonna need you to sign in here --
ROSS: Pattee? That your middle name?
ERIN: Nope. Maiden.
ROSS: You're married.
ERIN: Not anymore.
