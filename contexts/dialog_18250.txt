LORETTA: Here. Ti amo.
COSMO: Ti amo.
LORETTA: You look tired.
COSMO: What's your news?
LORETTA: I'm getting married.
COSMO: Again?
LORETTA: Yeah.
COSMO: You did this once it didn't work out.
LORETTA: The guy died.
COSMO: What killed him?
LORETTA: He got hit by a bus.
COSMO: No! Bad luck! Your Ma and I been married fifty-two years an nobody died. You were married, what, two years, and somebody is dead. Don't get married again, Loretta. It don't work out for you. Who's the man?
LORETTA: Johnny Cammareri.
COSMO: Him? He's a big baby. Why isn't he here with you telling me?
LORETTA: He's flying to Sicily. His mother's dying.
COSMO: More Bad Luck! I don't like his face, Loretta. I don't like his lips. When he smiles I can't see his teeth. When will you do it?
LORETTA: In a month.
COSMO: I won't come.
LORETTA: You've got to come. You've got to give me away.
COSMO: I didn't give you away the first time.
LORETTA: And maybe that's why I had the Bad Luck. Maybe if you gave me away, and I got married in a church, in a wedding dress, instead of at the City Hall with strangers standing outside the door, maybe then I wouldn't had the Bad Luck I had.
COSMO: Maybe.
LORETTA: I didn't have no wedding cake, no reception or nothing. Johnny got down on his knees and proposed to me at The Grand Ticino.
COSMO: He did?
LORETTA: Yeah.
COSMO: That don't sound like Johnny. Where's the ring?
LORETTA: Here.
COSMO: It looks stupid. It's a pinky ring. It's a man's ring.
LORETTA: It's temporary.
COSMO: Everything is temporary. That don't excuse nothing.
LORETTA: So you'll come to the wedding, right?
COSMO: Let's go tell your Mother.
