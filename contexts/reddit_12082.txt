I got high with a celebrity's nephew.
because it's easy to obtain the identity of this person, i wont give out anymore information on his identity. 
so, what bothered me was that i believe this person has a real drug problem, and even so much as feel genuinely sorry for this guy. 
while a friend and i were smoking weed, this person left the room for about an hour, and came back a completely different person from the nice guy i thought he was. he was itchy, twitchy, talking fast and about nonsense and moving all over the place.
it hit me: this dude wasn't high on weed. he was on something far worse...
when i later asked my friend in privet what his deal was, all he said was: "we think he has a drug problem. but we don't talk about it."
i guess it just bothers me so much because i sense how unhappy this person was (even though being related to a celebrity and able to grow up so privileged).
