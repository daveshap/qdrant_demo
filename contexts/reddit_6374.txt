Looking for advice on current job.
*(Throwaway due to coworkers knowing my main account)*

Without going in great detail, I'm seeking advice on my current job situation.

Currently, I work what one might consider a first "real" job out of college. But, it's nothing that truly holds true to my degree. Yes, it somewhat similar, but it's not what I'd consider something I went to college for. Without typing out long and endless paragraphs, I figure I'd just give bullet-points on what facts I've gathered myself and ask some question(s) after:

* I've been with the company around three months now. I'm mostly trained up, and can do most of the work without help. *I plan on sticking with the company for around 6 months currently, or until summer.*

* I get paid around 12.00 an hour, 40 hours a week. No overtime. Boss said it's around 26,000 a year, without taxes taken out.

* From my point of view, my hours are horrible. I work times between 12-1:00am in eight hour shifts, one hour break, with a bit of a commute (20-mins) each day. This includes every weekend and every holiday. (I cannot take off any holiday) I have zero social life at the moment due to everyone else having "normal" day jobs.

* This current company has VERY high turnover in my position, and there is no room for advancement, and no chance of a raise.

* This current job is both high and low stress, often going from 0 to 100 in about thirty seconds sometimes. But my coworkers are nice enough to help manage that stress.

* What I currently do is not what I want to do with the rest of my life. But it's the first thing that came along that I could take with having to support myself after college. I'm learning some very good skills, but only a select few apply to what I want to be doing later in life.

So, I have some question(s) that I would perhaps like some answers or advice on:

1 - Do you think leaving after six months is a good idea based upon what I stated above? (Of course, this is a relative term, I plan on having a new job lined up before I resign) This is currently my plan.

2 - How would I address this six-month job on my resume, if I *need* to place it on there due to it looking very nice.
