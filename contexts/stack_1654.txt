Software controlled variable voltage AC supply with SSR relays I have an autotransformer like this one :I would like to control it with an arduino solid state relay like this one:What would happens if I wire every output of the transformer together to the same output and accidentally turn on more than one relay at the same time ?For example, the 80v, 120v and 150v turned on at the same time would output :80 + 120 + 150 = 350v ?(80 + 120 + 150)/3 = 116v ?230v because this is the maximum input ?Would it be dangerous ? I don't really understand how an autotransformer work. Any idea how I could achieve it safely ?
