Shout out to all the significant others out there who love us, and listen to us - even when we ramble the same thing over and over and over again.
I had HORRIBLE anxiety last night - which later led into a panic attack in bed ^(yay!)

My fiance just kept reassuring me and listening. Holding me close. He kept patient with me even during his horrible migraine. It got to that point where I was annoyed with myself but couldn't turn it off. He was still there. Listening. Never upset. He just wanted to make sure I was okay and calming down.

Thank you to all of y'all out there doing this for us. This shit is hard. Mentally draining. It's such a relief to be able to get this shit out verbally and not be yelled at or told to "hush up."

Y'all the real MVPs.

Edit: I should have also put family/friends etc. Not just significant others!!!   
But dang - thank yall so much for these wonderful replies. SO happy to see all the love!
