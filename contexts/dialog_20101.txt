SID: Thanks for covering for me.
ZACK: No problem, but who's Susan?
SID: My girl back home. We're supposed to get married after I get my wings. She was Tommy's girl. They were engaged to be married before he died. I should've told you about her. I don't know why I didn't, except I didn't want you to think I was a shit for making it with Lynette.
ZACK: I'm not your folks, man. You love this... Susan?
SID: She's the sweetest person I've ever known. Loves kids. Works with handicapped kids every afternoon at the church. Everybody loves her.
ZACK: I didn't ask you all that, Sweet Pea. I asked if you loved her.
SID: Listen, I'm not going to go to that little reunion party. I'm meeting Lynette at the motel. Best head in fifty-two states. After three days of survival training, how could I resist?
ZACK: You should've done what I did. A clean break.
SID: Lynette told me it really tore her up when you didn't call this week.
