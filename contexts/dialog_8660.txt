MARY: It's amazing, isn't it? Such a gift Howard gave the world.
STAN: Yeah.
MARY: To let people begin again. It's beautiful. You look at a baby and it's so fresh, so clean, so free. And adults... they're like this messy tangle of anger and phobias and sadness... hopelessness. And Howard just makes it go away.
STAN: You love him, don't you?
