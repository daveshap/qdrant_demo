Quitting FT Job for Back to Student Life?
Apologies if this isn’t the right thread but I need some advice from fellow grad students! 

Back story: I had begun my undergrad for nursing and switched degrees for health administration and information systems. I began working for a software company servicing a number of health facilities in a project management/support specialist type role. The job became 24 hours of stress so I moved to Chicago for an adventure - expensive. I now work in sales in the legal industry, and loathe it. Not my personality, and I want to get back to the medical world. 

Going back to school for physical therapy has been a dream at the back of my mind this last year. I’m debating quitting my current position and taking a pay cut to go back to school for the pre requisites I need and to have a more flexible schedule to allow me to obtain observation hours. 

I know many people keep their current jobs when going back to school, but the stress of my current role and lack of flexibility to obtain observation hours for a DPT program worries me. My goal would be to nanny and work part time in a medical office/clinic where I can grow my connection base as well. 

Looking for honest thoughts, opinions, and advice! Thank you!
