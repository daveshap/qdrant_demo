Be careful who you talk to
I’m a female who had an issue with suicide (still do) and who I thought was a friend came over to help me through it. All was good until he proceeded to force himself on me. He used my fragile mental state to take advantage of me. This happened over a week ago and he hasn’t spoken to me since. Be aware of who you speak to about this because I don’t want what happened to me to happen to someone else.
