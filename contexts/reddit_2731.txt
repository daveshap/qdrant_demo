Can you ever be satisfied in a job if you’re not very career driven?
I’m employed now, but my job is so emotionally draining and unmotivating that I’ve wanted to quit for at least a year. I’ve been actively applying, but I’m not sure which route to go because my skill set is varied and I’m also only 2 years out of college. I’ve never envisioned myself in a particular job, so I’m feeling a little lost. 

My skill set and interests are all over. I’ve done copy writing, video, social media, photography, email marketing, HTML. It seems like my only option is something in marketing, but that’s where I am now and can’t stand it. 

I’m not sure what I really want to do either because I’m not very career driven. I’ve never pictured myself climbing the corporate ladder or understood the undying dedication some people have for their careers and companies that can drop you in a heartbeat. I just work for a paycheck, I have no passion for my work at all and find more satisfaction in my hobbies and side projects, which involve art and photography. But I also don’t want to turn a hobby into a career because I don’t want to grow to hate it. 

I’m feeling lost on what to do, but I don’t want to hate going to work everyday.
