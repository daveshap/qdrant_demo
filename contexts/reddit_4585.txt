I'm obsessing over a man that doesnt think twice about me.
So here's the deal. I've been involved off and on with this guy for over a year, with a strong falling out ending our "friends with benefits" the first time. But once we matured and got over it, we started seeing each other again. I've always had feelings for him, but have kept them at bay. He's very aware of these feelings because I've told him. However, he doesnt want ANYTHING more than booty calls and the occasional sleep over. He's honestly kind of an asshole, but I am so fucking infatuated with him that it scares me. I find myself constantly checking to see if he's read my messages or is online or has posted something. I can't stop thinking about him. 
I try so hard to keep myself distracted with work or hobbies, but my mind immediately goes right back to him when it's all done... 
What do I do? I want him to show some kind of emotional bond towards me, but I know that's not something I can control. I need help accepting the situation I'm in. 
I honestly think I'm so head over hills for him because I dont think I'm good enough for anything more. I'm overweight, and he's gorgeous and fit. I feel like I dont deserve or can't get more than him.
