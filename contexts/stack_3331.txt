Why couldn't Checkov beam Khan to the ship at the end of Star Trek Into Darkness, but after Khan and Spock fight he could? Towards the end of the movie Checkov claims there's no way to beam Khan aboard ship after Spock asks him to because \"there is too much damage\" and he \"can't get a signal\"... But after Spock and Khan fight he is not only able to beam Khan, but Spock and Uhura back aboard the ship... Like, huh? I thought there was too much damage. Made zero sense to me how all of a sudden he was able to beam them when he just claimed there was too much damage to retrieve a signal.
