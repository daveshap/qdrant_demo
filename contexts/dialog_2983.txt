BASQUIAT: I don't even have any friends anymore besides you. And everyone says Warhol? That death-warmed over person on drugs? He's just using you.""
ANDY WARHOL: Gee. You shouldn't take it so seriously, Jean. That's why you can't stop taking drugs. You always think people don't like you. Everyone likes you.
BASQUIAT: People are only interested in you because you're famous, not because they know a fuckin' thing about your work.
ANDY WARHOL: Bruno called. In Europe, people are saying you're gonna die from drugs. They think they can cash in on your death.
BASQUIAT: When I was poor, everybody doubted I could make it. When I got rich, everyone said, `yeah, but he'll never keep it up.' Now everyone says `he's killing himself.' So I clean up, and then they say `Look. His art's dead.' I don't take drugs, anyway. I'm healthy now.
