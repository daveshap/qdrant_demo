WILSON: Pleasure.
VALENTINE: Have we met? There's something I can't quite --
WILSON: EMI in London. I work with Ian.
VALENTINE: Ah.
WILSON: You must know Ian.
VALENTINE: I don't.
WILSON: Great bloke. Really turned things around there. 180 degrees.
VALENTINE: I suppose that's good, unless things were fine the way they were.
WILSON: Oh, I think a shake-up was in order. Definitely. Otherwise, people get lazy, don't they? Forgetful. Start thinking they can get away with things. Gotta shake 'em up now and again, make 'em pay attention.
