DICK: Back off, man.
BRUCE: You don't understand. It's an addiction. You fight night after night, trying to fill the emptiness. But the pain's back in the morning. And somewhere along the way it stops being a choice. I want better for you.
DICK: Save the sermons about how great you want my life to be, okay, Bruce? If it weren't for Batman my parents wouldn't be dead. You don't get it, do you? This is all your fault.
BRUCE: Too much wealth. Too fast. Half of Gotham zombied-out. A technology that self destructs. He's protecting more than industrial secrets, Alfred.
ALFRED: I shall be near at hand. Should you need me. And sir, I know it's difficult but try and have a good time.
CHASE: If I didn't know better, I'd say you were sulking.
BRUCE: Keep me off the couch, Doc. Your fees are a little rich for me.
CHASE: Touchy, touchy.
BRUCE: So how goes your `scholarly' pursuit of Batman?
CHASE: Oh God, Bruce. You're still jealous.
BRUCE: Spare me the diagnosis, okay? You're being ridiculous. I can't be jealous of Batman. Can I?
