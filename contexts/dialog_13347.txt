GABRIELLE: Yes, please, somebody ask him what is wrong.
NATHAN: I don't know.
NATHAN: I want our boy back.
GABRIELLE: Oui.
NATHAN: That bitch. I worked so hard. We worked so hard, you and I. He would've made us famous.
GABRIELLE: We still have you and I.
NATHAN: I know. And that's great. But it would be great in a better way, not a better way but a different way, if I could find him and bring him back.
GABRIELLE: Where do we look for little lost Puff?
NATHAN: I have some thoughts. I think that hairy bitch is somewhere trying to turn him back into an ape.
GABRIELLE: That is horrible. Apes are dirty. No?
NATHAN: You better believe they're dirty! And smelly! And messy! And they don't know their forks from their assholes!
NATHAN: I'm going alone. This could be dangerous.
GABRIELLE: Okay, my sweet. Good night.
NATHAN: A little resistance would be nice, damn it.
GABRIELLE: Please let me go with you.
NATHAN: No.
GABRIELLE: Okay.
