GABRIEL: Get in the CAR!
RUDY: How'd you know my name...
ASHLEY: What?
RUDY: Rudy. How'd you know my name?
ASHLEY: What are you talking about?
RUDY: You said Merry Christmas, Rudy.
ASHLEY: I... you told me your name was Rudy. You told me a million times, back in the truck, telling me you weren't Nick --
RUDY: No --
ASHLEY: You were screaming you weren't Nick! And we just didn't fucking believe you!
RUDY: But I never said Rudy.
ASHLEY: You said it a million times!
RUDY: I never told you my name.
GABRIEL: Ash?
RUDY: How'd you know my name was Rudy.
GABRIEL: Ash?
RUDY: How'd you know my name.
