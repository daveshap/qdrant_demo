Does the US President have the power to just cut off trade from any country he chooses?
This is in response to Trump’s comments after the G7 summit: [Trump threatens to end trade with allies](https://www.google.com/amp/amp.nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/06/trump-threatens-to-end-all-trade-with-allies.html)

Could the president just wake up one day and declare all trade with Canada is done? Would congress have any say here? 

The senate has discussed [limiting the president’s power on trade,](https://www.npr.org/2018/06/06/617277252/gop-senators-want-to-limit-trumps-power-on-trade), but what limits are there currently?
