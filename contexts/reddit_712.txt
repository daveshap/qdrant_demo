If I didn't do well in sports in high school will I have a second chance to do them in university?
I'm 16 and I'm going into my last year of high school. I've never really been good at sports. I tried and tried but I was always terrible and could never play well. Now im towards the end of high school and I'm wondering if I'll get a chance to try again in university? Does anyone who's graduated high school know if this is possible?
