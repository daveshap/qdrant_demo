BATMAN: Death. Death. Without taste, sound and all around us. Because there is no way for me to save them or myself. This is one giant death trap.
RIDDLER: Excellent. See. Who says a guy in a rubber suit can't be smart? Well, it's been grand. Sorry you all have to die now.
BATMAN: Wait. I have a riddle for you.
RIDDLER: For _me_? Really? Tell me.
BATMAN: I see without seeing. To me, darkness is as clear as daylight. What am I?
RIDDLER: Oh please. You're blind as a bat.
BATMAN: Exactly!
