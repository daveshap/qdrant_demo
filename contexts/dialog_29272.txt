QUAID: Lori...
LORI: Yeah, sweetheart?
QUAID: Let's do it.
LORI: Do what?
QUAID: Move to Mars.
LORI: Honey, do you have to spoil a perfectly wonderful morning.
QUAID: Just think about it.
LORI: Sweetheart, we've been through this a million times. You'd hate it on Mars. It's dry; it's ugly; it's boring! --I mean, really, a revolution could break out there any minute.
QUAID: Cohaagen says it's just a few extremists.
LORI: And you believe him?
QUAID: All right, forget about it.
