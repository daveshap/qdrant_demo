ARLETTA: You think life is some kind of ocean voyage and you start out with buntin' and hollerin' and high hopes, but the damn ship goes down before you ever reach the other side. Luke?
LUKE: Here, Mom.
ARLETTA: What went wrong?
LUKE: Nothin'. Ever'thing's cool's can be.
ARLETTA: No.
LUKE: Tried to live always just as free and aboveboard as you been, and well, they ain't that much elbow room.
ARLETTA: You allus had good jobs, and that girl in Kentucky I taken a shine to her.
LUKE: She took off with that convertible feller...
ARLETTA: Well, why not? Idee of marryin' got you all choked up, trying to pretend you was respectable you was borin' the hell out of all of us.
LUKE: Yeah.
ARLETTA: I'm leavin' the place to John.
LUKE: That's good: he earned it.
ARLETTA: Nothin' to do with it. I ain't never give John the kind of feelin' I give you, so I'm payin' him off now. Don't feel you got to say anything. Way it is, sometimes, you just have a feelin' for a child or you don't, and with John I just didn't.
LUKE: Gotta go, Arletta.
ARLETTA: Laugh it up, kid. You'll make out.
