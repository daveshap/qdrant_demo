What is wrong with not wanting responsibility?
A person not wanting this still help with the work that is given, still report for as long as 8hrs a day, not get paid doing nothing just that they are doing it in support style instead of carry frontline. But to the company eye when they hire a person like that they feel that they made a wrong decision which I am not getting as they still helped out no matter how you look at it. They get viewed as someone who are getting paid to do nothing or lazy and negative impression.
