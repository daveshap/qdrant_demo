Exporting SQL Server .bak files to a shapefile? I have no experience using Microsoft SQL Server at all. Someone gave me a .bak file of their database and said that I can extract their spatial data that way. They said that they would not export them as JSON, KML, or shapefiles for me.So... how can I open the .bak file and export the tables/data that I need as shapefiles? I am currently downloading SQL Server Express. I have very limited knowledge of SQL.
