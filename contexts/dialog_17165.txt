ANDY: This is great. The crowd's gonna love this! Hey... do you still think any of those cowgirls are still alive?
ZMUDA: I dunno. If they were, they'd be pushin' 80.
ANDY: Well, call SAG. It'd be cool to get one on the show. I want the evening to build and build. It's gonna have the most incredible ending: Singers, dancers, the Hallelujah Chorus" -- then the sky opens
ZMUDA: And you say, Santa
ANDY: No! NO NO NO! None of that! I want this show to be positive!
