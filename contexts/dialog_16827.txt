ROSE: ...say it, Jimmy...
JIMMY: Do you know the answer to this?
ROSE: I'm asking you. I'm asking you if you know why Clauida will not speak to you....please, Jimmy....tell me.
JIMMY: I think that she thinks I may have molested her.
JIMMY: She thinks terrible things that somehow got in her head...that I might have done something. She said that to me last time...when it was...ten years ago she walked out the door, You touched me wrong..." "I know that." Some crazy thought in her
ROSE: Did you ever touch her?
JIMMY: ...No....
ROSE: Jimmy, did you touch her?
JIMMY: I don't know.
ROSE: ...Jimmy...
JIMMY: I really don't know.
ROSE: But you can't say....
JIMMY: <u>I don't know what I've done</u>.
ROSE: Yes you do....you do and you won't say.
JIMMY: ...I don't know...
