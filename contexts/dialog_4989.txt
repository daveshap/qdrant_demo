WALTER: I'm sorry about what I said before.
CARLA: Forget it.
WALTER: I've been thinking... Carla, would you do one favor for me?
CARLA: Just about anything, Walter.
WALTER: Would you let me make...a statue of you?
CARLA: Would you really like to? That would make me very happy.
WALTER: Ok...tonight. I'll make a statue of you tonight, OK?
