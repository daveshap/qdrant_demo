Web Crypto API maturity for JavaScript RSA encryption? We have been using a JavaScript crypto API to do RSA encryption in the browser. I know all the criticisms on encryption in JavaScript but we have evaluated pros and cons of the solution and the risks are acceptable for us. In the past we used pidcrypt but now the project is abandoned so I was looking for a standard library and I have seen the Web Crypto API. The question is how much is it mature the standard especially on mobile devices?
