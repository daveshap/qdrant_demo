CLEMENTINE: You like that?
JOEL: Very much.
CLEMENTINE: This... someone gave that to me, just like, recently. I like it, too. I like crows. I think I used to be a crow.
JOEL: Thanks. That was good, that crow sound.
CLEMENTINE: Do you believe in that stuff? Reincarnation?
JOEL: I don't know.
CLEMENTINE: Me neither. Oh, there's an inscription on the back. The way a crow/Shook down on me/The dust of snow/From a hemlock tree/Has given my heart/A change of mood/And saved some part/Of a day I rued.
JOEL: Frost?
CLEMENTINE: Yeah. I'm not, like, a Robert Frost lover by any stretch. His stuff seems strictly grade school to me. But this made me cry for some reason. Maybe because it is grade school. Y'know?
JOEL: It's pretty.
CLEMENTINE: I miss grade school. I don't know why I'm calling it grade school all of a sudden. When I went we called it elementary school. But I like grade school better. Sounds like something someone from the forties would call it. I'd like to be from then. Everyone wore hats. Anyway, cheers!
JOEL: Cheers.
CLEMENTINE: God, that feels so fucking good. Take yours off.
JOEL: I'm fine.
CLEMENTINE: Yeah? Well, have a seat, anyway.
CLEMENTINE: Ready for another?
JOEL: No, I'm okay for now.
