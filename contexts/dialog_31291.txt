MISS GULCH: Mr. Gale!
UNCLE HENRY: Howdy, Miss Gulch.
MISS GULCH: I want to see you and your wife right away....
MISS GULCH: ... about Dorothy.
UNCLE HENRY: Dorothy? Well, what has Dorothy done?
MISS GULCH: What's she done? I'm all but lame from the bite on my leg!
UNCLE HENRY: You mean she bit you?
MISS GULCH: No, her dog!
UNCLE HENRY: Oh, she bit her dog, eh?
MISS GULCH: NO!
MISS GULCH: That dog's a menace to the community. I'm taking him to the sheriff and make sure he's destroyed.
DOROTHY: Destroyed? Toto? Oh, you can't! You mustn't! Auntie Em! Uncle Henry! You won't let her, will you?
