GEORGE: Father, did I act like that when I graduated from high school?
POP: Pretty much. You know, George, wish we could send Harry to college with you. Your mother and I talked it over half the night.
GEORGE: We have that all figured out. You see, Harry'll take my job at the Building and Loan, work there four years, then he'll go.
POP: He's pretty young for that job.
GEORGE: Well, no younger than I was.
POP: Maybe you were born older, George.
GEORGE: How's that?
POP: I say, maybe you were born older. I suppose you've decided what you're going to do when you get out of college.
GEORGE: Oh, well, you know what I've always talked about –– build things . . . design new buildings –– plan modern cities –– all that stuff I was talking about.
POP: Still after that first million before you're thirty.
GEORGE: No, I'll settle for half that in cash.
