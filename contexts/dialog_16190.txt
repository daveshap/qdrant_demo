NICKY: Hello, friend, my name is Nicky. I understand you're seeking a roommate, as per your advertisement in the Village Voice. Would it be possible for me to fill the slot?
TODD: Uh, don't you want to know what the rent is?
NICKY: Yes. What is rent?
TODD: Eight-hundred, split down the middle. Tuesdays and Thursdays I rehearse with my scene partner so the living room will be off limits.
NICKY: Off limits.
TODD: Right. And as far as household items: we can share the soap, but we'll split the cost 60/40. Cause the person who physically goes out and buys the soap shouldn't have to pay as much as the other guy. Aren't you boiling in that outfit?
NICKY: No.
TODD: It's like eighty degrees in this hallway. You from the South?
NICKY: Yeah. The deep South.
TODD: Why is that funny?
NICKY: I don't know.
TODD: And sorry, man, but no dogs allowed.
BEEFY: You'll be alright. Go on. Big day tomorrow. Don't forget to do that sleep thing I told you about.
NICKY: Got ya. Is it okay if I do the sleep thing?
