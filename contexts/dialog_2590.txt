KIT: Listen. I got a lot of respect for her, sir. That's about as good a one as I know to tell you.
FATHER: Well, it's not good enough. Just what do you think would happen to her if she stuck around with you, Kit? Guy like you.
KIT: She'd get along okay. And if she didn't, well, she could take off, just take off, I wouldn't mind... I'd always tell people I deserved it.
