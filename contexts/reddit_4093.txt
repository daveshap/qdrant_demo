Why it's okay to be single.
TL;DR: Social media's a lie, your singleness does not define you, and you can have a fun life without a SO. 

Look, I've been there. Your friends are all going out on dates, posting on social media about their SO, and seeing all the comments from people about how they're "relationship goals." Meanwhile you're spending your Friday night on your own (again...), feeling lonely, and binge watching the newest season of Arrow on Netflix (no? Just me? Ok...) 

You want a relationship, but can't find someone no matter how hard you try. The girl you thought was infatuated with you is "too busy" to go out. The guy who was flirting with you at the party won't even return your text. I've been there, and I know how it feels to want a relationship so bad when it seems nobody will give you a chance. 

I know coming from a stranger on the internet, this may mean nothing, but here's a few lessons I had to learn to be content with being single.

- Social media is a BIG FAT LIE. The whole point of social media is to make your life look better than it actually is. Those pictures of your friend at the beach cuddling with her ripped boyfriend? Those pics of your bro at the club grinding on his hot girlfriend? All lies. Life ain't a Disney movie. Couples have the same problems we do (maybe even more). Just because someone posts a cute picture with a caption like, "I love you to the moon and back ‚ù§" doesn't mean that they have a happy relationship. Once you realize it's all just a show, it becomes much easier to enjoy being single. 


- Your singleness does not define you. Sure, the constant questions from your friends and family about, "When are you gonna start dating someone?" may have you thinking otherwise. And that's your first mistake. Letting the opinion of someone (even if it's someone you love) pressure you into finding a relationship will only lead to more problems down the road. If you want a relationship because you think it'll make your life better, by all means do so. If you want a relationship just so Grandma Bethany will stop nagging you about it, reexamine yourself and find out who/what you are doing this for. Life gets a lot easier when you just stop caring what others think.


- Being single doesn't mean you can't have a fun and fulfilling life. Sure, it would be nice to have someone to watch the new Mission Impossible movie with, but that doesn't mean I can't watch it on my own. 

Story time: One time I asked this girl to go see Justice League. She said she'd "think about it" and that she'd get an answer to me soon. Being the idiot I was at the time, I waited for her answer. 2 freaking weeks, until she decided to cancel it all together. That weekend, I decided, "Forget it. I've been waiting for this movie all year, I'm seeing it with or without her." And while the movie was nothing to write home about, I still had a fun time that I probably wouldn't have had if I was with a girl who didn't give a crap about me. 

Once you drill these 3 guidelines into your head, you'll realize that being single is NOT a curse. Sure, a relationship would be great, but being single doesn't mean you're a failure at life or that no one will ever love you (2 things I've thought a lot about before...). It's simply a fact about yourself, like what TV show you like or what's your favorite color. It doesn't determine how "socially superior" you are. It just means you're free and down to mingle. Nothing more, nothing less.
