I FaceTimed a girl too young for me and my friends found out
I am in 10th grade and I talked to an 8th grader for a few days. Sometimes we had her friend on there and we would talk. That friend decided to send a picture of us to my group of friends and they made fun of me and probably have sent it to other people. How can I get over this?
