Pay stubs
So I was recently working at tacobell and I had to quit my job very shortly after getting it. When I was working there, I didnt have a bank account so they gave me a card with bank of america money network. There was a verification problem with my address, and so they put the account on hold. I need to send them a copy of pay stub with my address on it. I called the taco bell and asked if I could go and get a copy of one from them. They said to make an account on greenshade and i could access them from there. The problem is, it doesnt show your address on the website. The problem with the pay stub is that since my mailing address and my home address are different it shows the mailing address. Is this the address they are looking for? I sent the pay stub to their email and I'll see if it worked, but I dont know if I did this right or not. I dont know what to do at all honestly. I live in central Texas.
