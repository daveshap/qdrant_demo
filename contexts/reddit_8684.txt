What are the pros and cons of how Obama has handled Chelsea Manning and Edward Snowden. Were they legitimate "whisteblowers" or has he actually not violated his campaign promise to have the "most transparent administration"
With Obama's commutation of [Chelsea Manning] (https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/17/us/politics/obama-commutes-bulk-of-chelsea-mannings-sentence.html?_r=0), I have looked more into the case, with some calling chelsea manning a [whistle blower] (https://www.buzzfeed.com/dominicholden/obama-manning-decision) some call her a [traitor] (http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/tom-cotton-slams-obama-traitor/2017/01/17/id/769069/)

some have called snowden a [traitor] (http://thediplomat.com/2013/12/yes-edward-snowden-is-a-traitor/) while others have stated he was a [whistleblower] (https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/snowden-was-a-whistleblower-not-a-traitor/2015/05/14/8b3346e4-f990-11e4-a47c-e56f4db884ed_story.html)

[snowden claims he had no correct channels] (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2014/03/12/edward-snowdens-claim-that-as-a-contractor-he-had-no-proper-channels-for-protection-as-a-whistleblower/?utm_term=.c1f3e81e3a3b) and some dispute that

As both cases are high profile and somewhat related I figured I could combine this into one post. 

Did they go along the proper channels? did they not try? why doesn't edward snowden come back to the US? where they definitional a whistleblower?
