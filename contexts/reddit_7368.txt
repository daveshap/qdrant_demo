At salary negotiation phase of an interview. Not sure how much I should ask for.
Interviewing for a mid-level management position with a well known hotel chain.

Salary is unlisted, and nothing comes up on Glassdoor when searching the company + position title (similar position titles at other hotel chains appear, but the ranges are wildly varied). Payscale is the same, with numbers all across the board.

I have no idea how much I should be asking for, and was able to stall with "I have done a fair bit of market research into the pay range of those with similar titles and responsibilities and have decided on a range that I would be comfortable with. Can you tell me what you have budgeted for this position so that we can come to agreeable terms together?" in the first interview when asked how much I was looking for.

Second interview is on Thursday and I know Salary negotiation is going to resume (because they told me we would discuss salary further during the second interview) but I'm not sure what kind of a ballpark to expect.

Job title would officially be Meeting & Conference Services Manager, the closest listed salary I can find within the same company is that they pay their Event Coordinators ~$50k/yr on average. Other searches I've done show that national average for "Meeting Managers" is ~$52k, and for "Conference Services Managers" it's ~$47k. Of course this is an average, and doesn't factor in location so I don't know how accurate it is.

I'd be willing to accept $45k/yr at the lowest, but I don't want to broadcast that, and I'd certainly rather be sitting closer to the $50k mark. I don't want to lose my opportunity at this position by asking for a number that's too high if their upper-limit just so happens to be $45k. I'm just not sure what else I can do on my end before going into the interview on Thursday.
