MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN: Yes?
BETTY: Diane?
MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN: Number 17.
BETTY: But it said #12.
MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN: I switched apartments with her. She's in #17. Just walk down that way. It's just to the right.
BETTY: Well ... we'll leave her a note.
MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN: I'll go with you. She's still got some of my stuff.
