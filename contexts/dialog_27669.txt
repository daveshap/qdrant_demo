ANNIE: Or would you rather I changed the subject?
MELANIE: I think so.
ANNIE: How do you like our little hamlet?
MELANIE: I despise it.
ANNIE: Well, I don't suppose it offers much to the casual visitor. Unless you're thrilled by a collection of shacks on a hillside. It takes a while to get used to.
MELANIE: Where are you from originally, Annie?
ANNIE: San Francisco.
MELANIE: How'd you happen to come here?
ANNIE: Oh, someone invited me up for the weekend a long time ago.
