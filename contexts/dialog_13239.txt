HAWK: You know Kaplan, if you weren't the slimiest pinata of shit that ever lived, I'd feel sorry for you.
SNICKERS: Good news, bud, the Mayflowers have moved up the time-table. You're hitting the Vatican to-night.
HAWK: Tonight? You're whacked. The timing's off, I'm underequipped Damnit, I have a date!
ALMOND JOY: Grapple, Biker's bottle, hairspray, black turtleneck, Pocket Fisherman, acid, collapsible yardstick, softball, and 72 stamps. Gee Stud, this is going to be some date. No Harvey's Bristol Cream?
KAPLAN: Snickers, make the list happen. Oh and it's one thing to play hide and seek with the Mayflower's pathetic staff, but we're sore losers. I've put jumper cables on the nipples of children and not always in the line of duty.
HAWK: Thanks for sharing.
KAPLAN: We blow up space shuttles for breakfast. You and your friend Alex would be a late afternoon Triscuit.
HAWK: If you do anything to my friend...
KAPLAN: Yeah, right. By the way, as long as I'm getting things off my chest, I'm the one who killed your little monkey. Made it look like a Mafia hit. Did it for fun. Ciao.
