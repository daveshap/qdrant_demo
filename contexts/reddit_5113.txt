Employer cancelled hiring process
Hi all. In a bit of a pickle here. I recently applied and was interviewed for a position. References were called and the day when I was informed a decision was to be made, I was told the employer decided to end the search and repost the job, and was told that I should feel free to apply again. I've never come across this situation before, so I wanted to hear from fellow job-seekers what the proper etiquette is. Is it worth reapplying? Do I send in the exact same materials I sent in the first time? TIA!
