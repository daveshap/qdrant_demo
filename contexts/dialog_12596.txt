ROB: Rob here.
LIZ: Hey. It's Liz.
ROB: What's happenin'.
LIZ: You called this morning?
ROB: Yeah. I just wanted to thank you for that message last night. It made me feel like... like less of an asshole.
LIZ: How're you holding up?
ROB: Actually, I'm fine. I'm great. Last night I got to thinking, you know what? Maybe it is time to move on. Maybe we're just not right for each other. Or maybe we are. But time will tell and at this point I'm going to be fine with whatever's meant to be." You know?"
LIZ: Yeah. Like I said, I don't want to take sides. And I like Laura with you. She's more fun, more open. You guys are good together. I just wish you two could, I don't know. I don't think much of this Ian guy --
DICK: Rob.
ROB: Liz, hold on a second -- What?
DICK: Marie LaSalle is in the store! Here, she's here, and now!
