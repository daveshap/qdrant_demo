so my church kicked me out of a group for something that I did a while back...
I keep trying to tell them I'm ready for social interaction but they keep telling me that I'm not ready. I don't think that they realize that I don't get any actual face to face interaction because of my fear of rejection and it's turning me away from the church... I even had to drop a class last semester because of this my dad has sent sevral emals to the chruch describing the situtation but they still won't invite me back I don't know what to do any more.
