I'm an unmoativated, lazy little bitch. Any solutions to my life?
Hey guys, I had an exam today which I totally failed. I had all the Christmas holidays to revise, yet I didn't do any. I told myself that today was the day, but it didn't help. I think I picked the wrong course to do, but it's my second time starting a course, so I need to stick through it. How can I try to enjoy it a bit more? I study Computer Science by the way. 

Someone please smack me across the face and make me wake up.
