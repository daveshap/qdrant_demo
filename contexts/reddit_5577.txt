What CEFR levels would I need to be employed in a foreign country?
I have reached the following CEFR levels:
English-C2
French-B2(Possible future C1?)
Spanish-B2(Currently preparing for C2 exam)
At what level are these languages considerable useful for professional purposes? (Excluding English, since there isn't a higher level) What level should I reach in French and Spanish to be employed in a foreign company? Would learning German be useful?
P.s. Sorry If this post is somewhat na√Øve...I don't know much about how employment works as I am still in high school,  but I would still like to have clear ideas about what skills I should possess to get a well-paid job.
