What certificates actually lead to jobs?
There is a technical school in my area. They have several programs of study but I’m not sure which certificates actually will help someone get a job and not be an add on to a degree. I’m not interested in going for a Bachelors. I don’t want to take on the loans nor am I certain what I would even want to go back to school for. I wouldn’t mind going the trade/certificate route, I’m just not sure where to begin. 

I currently work in the retail side of a pharmacy as a shift leader. I’ve been there almost 3 years. I can work in the pharmacy when needed but it’s definitely not something I enjoy. I’d rather be on the retail side. Before that I was an Operations Manager at a crafts store and an Assistant Manager at a gas station.
