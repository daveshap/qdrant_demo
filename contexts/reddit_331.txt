Moving too fast in my own life?
I'm a [19/f], currently a sophomore in college. For as long as i can remember, I've always wanted to skip this chunk of my life and get to a place where I can settle down and begin my life. People tell me all the time about missing out on the "college experience" and I just don't know if I'm really missing out on anything. I've gone through my phase of partying every weekend and drinking more than I ever imagined I would. That made me satisfied for a period of time, but now I'm back in a place that I wish I could just drop everything and move on. I hate this place of being at a stand-still, doing nothing but going to school and working a part-time job that leaves me feeling bored every day. I have so many ambitions and things I want to do with my life, and I wish I could enjoy things as they were now, but my mind is constantly stuck in the future. It doesn't bother me much, thinking ahead, but I feel that it holds me back from enjoying the moment.

I don't know what I can do to change my mind, I've thought this way for so much of my life. I want to be able to wake up in the morning and be excited about what I have to do, and I want to know how to make the best of the present.
