CAROL: That's right.
SOLDIER: Me, too. Got twenty-four days of furlough and I'm goin' home.
CAROL: Where's home?
SOLDIER: Utah, the Bee-Hive state. I'm from Orem, right near Salt Lake ... Say, you wouldn't happen to be a Mormon, would you?
CAROL: No, I'm not.
SOLDIER: Me, neither. There's about twelve people in the state that aren't Mormons and I'm one of them.
CAROL: That certainly makes you kind of special...
SOLDIER: Yeah... I guess it does.
SOLDIER: You wouldn't be taking the train to Salt Lake, would you?
CAROL: No, I'm afraid not.
SOLDIER: I never have any luck.
CAROL: STANDS AND PAUSES FOR A MOMENT.
CAROL: I really hope you have a nice trip.
SOLDIER: Thanks. I hope yours is okay, too.
