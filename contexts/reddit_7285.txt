How to cope with adopting a mess of a job
So long story short one of my coworkers was fired and I was placed in her position (education and experience lines up and they were disbanding my department) 

I pretty much adopted a mess. Things were put off/ignored and never done, things weren't done correctly and since my predecessor was fired, I did not get any training in this position. I was placed and my other coworkers are fantastic eith helping me but theres only so much that they can really provide me given it's not their position. It's been a week and I've been stressed out to the point of being sick about 3 times. I cant keep doing this. 

Any advice for relieving this mess? Any tips to help me keep my stress in check? 

I'm still relatively new and I'm so scared of losing my job.
