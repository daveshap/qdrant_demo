I went to a hockey game alone.
I hate going out alone, I hate feeling like everyone is watching me, I hate feeling like I’m being judged.

So it sucked when the person scanning my ticket that I’d bought in a moment of braveness two hours prior said “Oh, you’re here alone?”

It sucked when I had the seat squeezed between two groups of families.

It sucked when I had to get up and someone made sad eyes at me.

But I did it. I stayed the full game, I had fun, I don’t regret going.

The little victories.
