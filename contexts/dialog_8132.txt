EXLEY: You're twenty-two, aren't you, Ray?
COATES: Say what and so what.
EXLEY: Did one of the officers work you over a little?
EXLEY: You look like Robinson after that last LaMotta fight. 'Course LaMotta looked a lot worse. So you're twenty-two, right?
COATES: Man, why do you keep asking me that?
EXLEY: Just getting my facts straight. Twenty-two makes it a gas chamber bounce. You should have pulled this caper a couple of years ago. Get life, do a little Youth Authority jolt, transfer to Folsom a big man. Orbit on some of that good prison brew, get yourself a sissy --
COATES: I never truck with no sissies!
EXLEY: That fucking Larry. I almost believed him.
COATES: Believed what?
EXLEY: Nothing, Ray. That Larry, he's a pisser. You did the Casitas Youth Camp with him, didn't you?
COATES: Man, why're you talkin' about Larry? His business is his business.
