Since the Senate required 60 votes to the pass the motion to bring the 3rd coronavirus bill to the floor, is there a procedural/process reason for why Sen. Mitch McConnell voted against the motion making it a 47-47 tie?

The 3rd coronavirus bill was stopped on 3/22/2020 after the Senate fell short of the 60 votes needed to stop debate and vote on the bill. The bill would have provided relief measures intended to help the American people during the coronavirus crisis. However, Democrats argued that the bill had major flaws, and so unanimously voted against the motion to bring the bill to a full Senate floor vote.

The [motion](https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=116&session=2&vote=00077) was rejected by a 47-47 tie, as it needed a minimum of 60 votes to pass. Mitch McConnell was the only Republican to vote nay on the motion. According to the [video](https://floor.senate.gov/MediaPlayer.php?view_id=2&clip_id=3646) of the Senate proceedings for 3/22/2020, Mr. McConnell's vote happens at roughly 5 hours and 36 minutes into the clip, which happens to be the last vote on the motion. So my question is, are there any procedural/process reasons for making the motion a tie as opposed to being a 48-46?
