Does anyone else not consider Sunday a "day off" since you spend it in a constant state of panic thinking about the next day and week?
It's nauseating and exhausting. I can't eat or concentrate. I feel sick. Cold sweats and panic attacks. I hate the anticipation. It only fuels my anxiety and panic. How do you cope with Sunday anxiety?
