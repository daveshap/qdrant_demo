CAMPBELL: Mr. Duke, how can you claim that Jason Voorhees is not truly dead?
DUKE: How many times has Jason been reported killed before, Mr. Campbell?
CAMPBELL: Eight times.
DUKE: Eight times. They've burned him, dipped him in nuclear waste --
CAMPBELL: -- But this time they bombed him and then cremated the body.
DUKE: They coulda danced a jig on it an' fed it to goats -- don't matter. Ya' can't kill Jason by gettin' rid of his body. He'll come back the way he always do, to drag the kiddies into the darkness and crush their little skulls -- maybe even your skull, Mr. Campbell.
CAMPBELL: Well, let's hope not!
DUKE: Yeah, that'd be a big shame...
CAMPBELL: In the media, you've frequently been described as salty" --"
DUKE: -- look, just shut up. Let's cut through the shit. You asked me here because you want me to catch and kill Jason Voorhees for ya'. I'll do it, but it won't be easy...and it won't be cheap. One hundred grand, non- negotiable.
CAMPBELL: I understand. However, our audience should be aware that you only charged forty thousand dollars to catch the Idaho skin stretcher.
DUKE: Skin stretcher was human.
