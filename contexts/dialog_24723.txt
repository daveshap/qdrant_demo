REBECCA: I wish you wouldn't take the dog with you, David -- he's likely to be a burden to you.
DAVID LEE: I got to, Mama. I know Daddy wants to see him.
REBECCA: Here's your food -- now you go straight to that place -- if you need to rest, go into a church or railroad station -- but don't go into nobody's house, you hear me?
DAVID LEE: Yes, mam...
REBECCA: Ask your daddy to give you some word about when he'll be comin' home -- and tell 'im we love him.
