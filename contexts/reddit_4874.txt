Im losing it all because money troubles
 Im recovering from being on a massive suicide  watch from last year still going to weekly therapy and psych  alot too. Now i decided to take a semester off of college  my dad insists im never going to college  now cause of  it, my dad requests i work full time i oblige and work two jobs help with groceries and chores.  My dad asks for 70%percent of what i make, i said i cant cause i dont have a drivers license  and use ubers for getting to work which is 16 dollars a day(in a disability  program for it)   i said how  about  40% and the other 10% goes into college  savings i was told no. So flash forward to now im having trouble paying rent to my father cause i cant afford it, (note i have a twin and hes missed only one less payment than me and  he isnt being treated like this) so  i get woken up with a text telling me my dads shipping my off to help my emotionally abusive and sometimes physical abusive grandmother, i say no. Cause i dont want to miss out on my therapy and college. He points out how shitty i am,  he than tells me how cause my  i washed my hair in his shower im awful. I stated  my sister got  rent free for a year and only spent the same amount of grocery as i do. You also let her friend stay here rent free for 2 years, and my mothers friend for one, why dont i get that  i didn't even graduate Year ago. They were silent and than complained more about me and now im laying in my bed debating whether  i should keep living cause i cant afford life. The stock market crashed effecting my job i have to pay 300 and  ive only made 200 a month till recently. I wish i was dead i admitted what i did wrong to my family and apologized ( it was small shit like forgetting to lock the door after a friend left it open.)
