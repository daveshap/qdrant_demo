ORSINI-ROSENBERG: Did you not know that His Majesty has expressly forbidden ballet in his operas?
MOZART: Yes, but this is not a ballet. This is a dance at Figaro's wedding.
ORSINI-ROSENBERG: Exactly. A dance.
MOZART: But surely the Emperor didn't mean to prohibit dancing when it's part of the story.
ORSINI-ROSENBERG: It is dangerous for you to interpret His Majesty's edicts. Give me your score, please.
