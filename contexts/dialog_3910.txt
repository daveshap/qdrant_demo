HELEN: Calvin, I wish you would have at least let me do the dishes. It's not going to be that easy getting all that dried- on food off my nice plates.
CALVIN: I just hope those plates aren't radioactive by tomorrow morning.
HELEN: Cheese is particularly troublesome.
CALVIN: Worse than your Kraft Holiday dip?
HELEN: Oh, much worse. But not as bad as that Mexican Jumping Bean dip. You remember that?
CALVIN: Yeah, yeah. Okay. Give me the roast and watch your step. I'll come back for the radio.
PILOT: Tower, say again!!
TOWER: The SAR HELO is airborne with you in sight.
PILOT: I'm marking the 180 radial for five and ejecting.
TOWER: Roger, Wolf One.
HELEN: How long will we have to stay down here?
CALVIN: I don't know. For this thing to blow over, it could take days.
HELEN: Days??
CALVIN: Rather safe than sorry. That's my motto!
HELEN: But, what if I go into labor? That could happen any time.
CALVIN: I've read up on it. I'll deliver the baby myself if I have to.
HELEN: Now you listen to me Calvin Webber, when this baby comes, you're going to be out in the waiting room smoking yourself to death with all the other fathers.
CALVIN: Yes, dear!
HELEN: As long as we've got that straight.
CALVIN: Home sweet home!
HELEN: To you maybe.
