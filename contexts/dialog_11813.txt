GILL: It got you seven years probation. No computer, couldn't even use a touch tone phone.
PLAGUE: Must have been hell, huh? Zero Cool? A virus has been planted in the Ellingson Mineral computer system. You were our prime suspect, till we trashed your stuff and found no trace of it.
GILL: However, we have come to believe that one Joey Pardella is involved in this Ellingson virus. He or perhaps his accomplice has a disk that Mr. Belford needs to disable that virus. We want you to help us find it.
PLAGUE: Gill.
PLAGUE: Loser. I can't believe you were only eleven when you wrote this. It's quite an impressive virus. Dade, I know how you might feel about narking on your friends, but, we're hackers. For us, there's no such thing as family and friends. We're each our own country, with temporary allies and enemies. I'd like to make a treaty with you.
DADE: I'm sorry. Who are you?
PLAGUE: I'm the one who understands you. Now, can we be allies?
DADE: Nah. I don't play well with others.
DADE: Shit! Come on!
PLAGUE: Watch which friends you do play with. A record like yours could land you in jail, get you kicked out of school, no colleges would take you. No future. Exiled from everyone and everything you love.
