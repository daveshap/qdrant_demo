Something a lot of you don’t get told very often
Something a lot of you don’t get told very 
often:
I love you. And I do. I love every single one of you. Yes I may not know any of y’all but I still love each and every one of you. You know why? Because you are all beautiful and wonderful people. You may feel like nobody cares about you but that isn’t true whatsoever. You’ve helped me immensely. If y’all weren’t here some off us would be worse off than we are now. You may not see the will in fighting or pushing on. But I’m telling you, there will be something in your future that will push everything away. I believe in you. So I want you to believe and love yourself. Because if a random person off the internet can love you, you can love yourself as well.
