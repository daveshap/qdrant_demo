CHIGURH: No.
CARLA JEAN: I ain't got the money.
CHIGURH: No.
CARLA JEAN: What little I had is long gone and they's bill aplenty to pay yet. I buried my mother today. I ain't paid for that neither.
CHIGURH: I wouldn't worry about it.
CARLA JEAN: ...I need to sit down.
CARLA JEAN: ...You got no cause to hurt me.
CHIGURH: No. But I gave my word.
CARLA JEAN: You gave your word?
CHIGURH: To your husband.
CARLA JEAN: That don't make sense. You gave your word to my husband to kill me?
CHIGURH: Your husband had the opportunity to remove you from harm's way. Instead, he used you to try to save himself.
CARLA JEAN: Not like that. Not like you say.
CHIGURH: I don't say anything. Except it was foreseen.
CARLA JEAN: I knowed you was crazy when I saw you settin' there. I knowed exactly what was in store for me.
CHIGURH: Yes. Things fall into place.
