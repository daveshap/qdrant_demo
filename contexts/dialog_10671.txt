MURPHY: Just what the hell do you think you're doing?!
DODGE: I don't know what you're talking about?
MURPHY: I think you know.
DODGE: Maybe you can tell me then.
MURPHY: The radio!
DODGE: The radio. Oh, yeah, the radio.
DODGE: Take it easy, willya? What about the radio?!
MURPHY: You smashed it!
DODGE: What?!
MURPHY: Don't lie to me!
DODGE: What the fuck -- ?
MURPHY: You didn't want us calling anybody. Too liable to ruin your big payday.
DODGE: I didn't touch the fucking radio.
DODGE: I didn't touch the fucking radio! Ever occur to you there's somebody else on that boat, skipper?
MURPHY: Conveniently enough for you.
DODGE: Look, I didn't touch it. Alright?
