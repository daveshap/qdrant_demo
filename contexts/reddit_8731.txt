Are there legal implications to the President for directing Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about the how long the Trump Tower Moscow negations went on for?
[Buzzfeed News is reporting](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jasonleopold/trump-russia-cohen-moscow-tower-mueller-investigation?ref=hpsplash) that President Trump directed his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, to lie to Congress about how long negations went on about a Trump Tower Moscow project:

> Now the two sources have told BuzzFeed News that Cohen also told the special counsel that after the election, the president personally instructed him to lie — by claiming that negotiations ended months earlier than they actually did — in order to obscure Trump’s involvement.

> The special counsel’s office learned about Trump’s directive for Cohen to lie to Congress through interviews with multiple witnesses from the Trump Organization and internal company emails, text messages, and a cache of other documents. Cohen then acknowledged those instructions during his interviews with that office.

Do these allegations rise to the level of obstruction of justice or some other concrete violation of the law?

Edit: Mueller's office has issued a [statement refuting this report](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/18/us/politics/buzzfeed-cohen-russia-tower.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage).
