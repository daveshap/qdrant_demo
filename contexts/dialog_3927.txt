CALVIN: They've done a lot of re-building but society, at least as we knew it, has utterly collapsed. People throw up in the streets. Others point guns. There's something terribly wrong with the automobiles and...and I...I can't tell you the rest. I just can't.
HELEN: Oh my. Oh,my, oh my, oh, my. So, what do we do now?
CALVIN: We stay down here.
HELEN: We do?
CALVIN: Yes.
HELEN: Excuse me.
HELEN: For how long? We've just about run out of everything!
CALVIN: We'll make do. I'm of the opinion that these mutants will eventually kill each other off and then--
HELEN: No, Calvin. We're not going to make do. Not me! Not Adam. We're going up no matter what! We deserve it. Even if it's terrible!
CALVIN: Well, I am the head of this household--
HELEN: I want him to at least see the sky!
CALVIN: --and we will--
HELEN: And the ocean! A mountain range!
CALVIN: --do as I say!
ADAM: Dad!
HELEN: Oh, no! Oh, my goodness! Let's get him into the bedroom.
HELEN: He seems to be doing all right now. I don't know if he's had a heart attack or just... a horrifying experience. But we need supplies and I've got to stay with him.
ADAM: I'll go up.
HELEN: I'm afraid you've got to.
ADAM: I'll be all right.
HELEN: You're my brave boy.
