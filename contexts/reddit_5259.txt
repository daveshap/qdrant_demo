Applying for Communications Coordinator position. I need two writing samples. Suggestions?
To be upfront, my undergraduate background is in a science discipline. This position is associated with a catholic congregation that my high school was affiliated with. In that sense, I know some of the brothers belonging to the congregation and I am familiar with their ministry.

Now I currently work as GIS analyst but I use my free time to read and write. I have no doubt that I could write something up. But i'd like to see if anyone would have suggestions for prompts for these two writing samples. Preferably someone who works in a similar position.
