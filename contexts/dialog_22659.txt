PEGGY: And you are?
IKE: Looking for Maggie.
PEGGY: Yep. Maggie -- Someone to see you.
MAGGIE: Reporter?
PEGGY: Yup!
MAGGIE: I hope you have a different angle. It's pretty much all been covered.
IKE: Originality is my speciality.
MAGGIE: Excellent.
PEGGY: Hold on -- Nobody interviews Maggie in here unless they're getting haircut.
MAGGIE: She's the boss.
IKE: Sorry, no. I just got one.
MRS. PRESSMAN: Excuse me, sir. I have an actual fact for you.
IKE: Yes, Mrs. Pressman.
MRS. PRESSMAN: It's her fourth time to the altar, you know. Not seven like they said.
IKE: I know. Tell me something. Do you think she's going to make it all the way this time?
