ELIJAH'S MOTHER: No more sitting in this room. I've let it go on long enough.
ELIJAH: I'm not going out anymore. I'm not getting hurt again. This was the last time. I told you.
ELIJAH'S MOTHER: You can't do anything about that. You might fall between that chair and this television. If that's what God has planned for you, that's what's going to happen. You can't hide from it in your room.
