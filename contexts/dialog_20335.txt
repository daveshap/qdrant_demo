CRISWELL: Ahh, the curiousity of youth... on the road to ruin! May it ever be so adventurous!
SHIRLEY: I'm so frightened.
BOB: Well we certainly can't stay here. C'mon.
SHIRLEY: Where?
BOB: In there.
SHIRLEY: It frightens me.
BOB: Silly, there's nothing in there to be afraid of.
SHIRLEY: Then..then what's that music?
BOB: That's what I want to find out. We have to get help.
SHIRLEY: What help can we possibly find in the cemetery at this time of night?
BOB: Something's making that music.
SHIRLEY: I'm not sure I care to find out what it is.
BOB: All right. Don't worry, I'll be right beside you.
SHIRLEY: What help will that do if something in there isn't dead?
BOB: Not dead? In a cemetery?
SHIRLEY: I can't imagine anything dead playing that music.
BOB: Well, it's probably just the caretaker, and that's exactly who we want to find. They'll have a telephone. C'mon.
SHIRLEY: Could it be some kind of college initiation?
BOB: It's an initiation all right, but not of a college as you and I know them. Nothing alive looks like that!
SHIRLEY: Can't we get out of here?
BOB: I'm not sure...
SHIRLEY: What do you mean?
BOB: I'm not sure, myself. It's just a feeling I've had since the crash...Like I feel a cold chill all over.. ..Now this!
