KENNY: Hear you got your ass kicked in Hong Kong, James.
CARTER: What?? Where'd you hear that?
KENNY: I got my sources.
CARTER: And I got mine, meaning you. Nice how that works out. I'm serious this time, I'm closing this place down.
KENNY: James, you see my kids back there? You know how much I'm paying for private school? How can you come in here with this attitude, you being little Chang's godfather?
CARTER: Little Chang is gonna have to go visit his daddy in jail if you don't cooperate.
KENNY: Jail!? James, you better back off. Badge or no badge, I'll kick your ass.
CARTER: I'd like to see you try.
