How to save yourself after you knowingly failed an interview?
I had a group interview for a seasonal position at Bath and Body Works which consisted of about 12 people. I managed to get there 15 minutes before the scheduled time but some people showed up late. 
I'm extremely introverted so speaking in front of a group really isn't my forte. However I did add in a few comments and listened to whatever other people had to say. The manager asked just about 2 questions (what does good customer service look to you, how did you prioritize tasks) I stayed quiet most of the time because even the manager took some time talking about other customer's experiences and everybody else had something to say. By the time my time would come around she's already decided to move onto something else. I wanted to punch myself in the face for not saying anything.
I managed to ask a few questions (ie how do you keep up with the new lines that come out every month and if they've started using online receipts because other people tend to lose their physical copies) but that was about it. 
I'm sure my chances were kind of blown from not sharing anything but is there any way to get another "shot" at selling myself?
