JUNIOR: JUNIOR! You're supposed to say JUNIOR WHO! I'm going to have to hurt you. Theo and Junior circle one another.
JUNIOR: You shouldn't touch her.
THEO: No, Junior, you shouldn't touch her.
JUNIOR: Nobody touches her. Except me. I touch her. Sheila told me you played bouncy- bouncy with her.
THEO: What did your dad tell you to do to Buzz? Theo scrambles up the lane on hands and knees. Junior catches him, grabbing his ankles.
JUNIOR: He told me to play Blue-Face with Buzz. I like games.
THEO: What did you do to Buzz?
JUNIOR: You played bouncy-bouncy with Sheila, so I'm gonna play Blue-Face with you.
THEO: I don't want to play.
