**About Me**  

I am a Certified HR Professional with over 6 years of experience.  
Much of my experience has been in recruitment (*I am not a recruiter though*). What this means is that I am the person creating the jobs themselves, creating the postings for the jobs, receiving the applications, screening the applications & applicants, and conducting interviews with / coaching the managers on selection.  

I had many friends and colleagues approach me, throughout my career, asking for advice about their applications and job search *(engineers, nurses, pharmacists, business admin, and various entry level positions.)* ; all were successfully placed after receiving my advice within a reasonable time period (all under 6 months, within a labour market with an average 7.6% unemployment rate over the last 5 years).   

Most recently I was laid off from a job at the end of July (summer is slow job season), and got myself placed within 3.5 weeks after my lay-off.      

I've been reading through many posts about people sending applications and not getting any responses so I decided to create this guide to job search, application writing and submission.  

Hope someone finds it useful.  

**Guide Summary**  

Remember, HR is not a science it’s an art. The purpose of this guide is to give you the knowledge that I have from HR’s side, relevant to screening and selection so that you can better your application and thereby increase your chances of being selected.  

This guide is broken down into 3 segments:  

* Applicant
* Job posting
* Application  

In the applicant segment I go over competencies and core competencies.  This covers your strengths as an applicant and what you should focus on in your application (cover letter and resume).  

In the job posting segment we will dissect a sample job posting and go through what is what and where to look for key information when gearing up your application for submission.   

In the application segment we will cover what you should include, what you should not include and typical do-s and don’t-s when it comes to your application.

**Applicant**  
“What I can offer”

So you graduated university and are out to look for a job, you think you’ve had no prior job experience and that the road ahead is simply a dead end to part-time work in a field that is unrelated to what you studied.  

Or you’re simply a person who just got laid off and is not having any luck with your job search. Feeling that the world betrayed you and that you’re worthless?  

**FALSE, YOU SHOULDN'T**  

First things first, start with your attitude – you need to be in the right mindset when applying for jobs. You need to be confident but not cocky. Also, self-loathing applicants reflect that in their applications – trust me.  

Before we talk about your strengths, we need to cover what **competencies** are.  
Understanding competencies is important, because that’s what determines what the right **“fit”** is for a company.  

>Competencies are the measurable or observable knowledge, skills, abilities, and behaviours (KSABs) critical to successful job performance. Choosing the right competencies allows employers to: Plan how they will organize and develop their workforce.  
[Source](http://www.hr.wa.gov/WorkforceDataAndPlanning/WorkforcePlanning/Competencies/Pages/default.aspx)  

So companies will be looking for a specific set of KSAs (competencies) from their applicants. What this means is that you should *understand your own competencies and their limitations*. People faking it and lying in their job applications are easy to spot to be honest, and get weeded out very quickly. If you somehow slip through and make it, expect a very hard time in the job you landed with false information, unless you ninja your way through and manage to pick up the skills needed as you go. But be honest and ask yourself, do you really want to suffer through that, or would you rather be in a job that is rewarding in terms of experience and brings peace of mind?  

Those competencies are very specific in what they are. So how do employers define those competencies?  

Simple, competency dictionaries – here is my [favourite one](http://campusservices.harvard.edu/system/files/documents/1865/harvard_competency_dictionary_complete.pdf)  

Look through it and understand what you are putting on your resume. For example, when a company asks for good communication skills they typically want what’s in that dictionary. The dictionary will also go through “Key Actions” and “Job Activities” that demonstrate what good communication is. This dictionary is a sample one and does not contain everything and anything of course. Use google.  

**TIP**: Transferable skills, you have them and they cross over nicely to many fields or industries - if you worked as a barista, for example, you have been developing certain competencies: verbal communication, organization and time management, contributing to team success, stress tolerance etc. Those are applicable to working in an office environment, trust me.
  
So now that you understand what competencies are, take a look at what you’ve done in the past in terms of work experience and schooling. Ask yourself these questions:  

* How have they shaped and developed your competencies throughout your life and career?
* What can you do well?  

**Your cover letter and resume need to convey your competencies, VERY CLEARLY.**  Here is the ideal layout of what you should include in your cover letter  to showcase your competencies:  
.  
.  

-----------------------------------------------  
  
Date  
Name  

Dear XXX,  
It is with great interest that I submit my application for XXX position with your awesome company, your company is great because (**blah blah blah I’ve done my research about your company i.e. I’m not writing a generic letter here**) etc.  
  
What I can offer / what sets me ahead of other applicants is XXX (**list your competencies here, talk about them and about how they can benefit the employer, best yet talk about how they match what they are looking for in a candidate**) etc.  
  
My experience, schooling and qualifications have prepared me for this shit, I am awesome and you will love me immediately I promise (**paraphrased, do not include that as is**).  
  
I look forward to further discussing my qualifications with you, I can be contacted at XXX.  
  
Signed,

**Job Posting**  
“What they’re looking for”  

So, now we move on to looking at what a job posting will have and what we need to look for when applying for a job.  
Let’s go with [this sample](http://www.hr.umich.edu/empserv/department/newsletter/sampleposting.pdf) for now.  
You will notice some key elements that you need to look at:  

* Typical work duties  
* Minimum qualifications (must haves)  
* Desired qualifications (nice to haves)  

For *typical work duties*, you need to read carefully through them and start mapping your experience and expertise to those duties, relative to your competencies.  

For minimum qualifications or MUST haves, you need to make sure that you have those. If it says min 5 yrs experience, you better have that or make one hell of an argument for that. If you do not have the min qualifications DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME.  

**TIP**: Students, your degree counts as condensed experience! For all those of you who say: “Scumbag employer says entry level but requires experience” **YOUR DEGREE IS YOUR EXPERIENCE!**  

For nice to haves or *desired qualifications*, make sure you check off as many of those as you can – not having them will not impede your ability to do the job, but having them will tell the employer that you can definitely do the job easier.  

**TIP**: What this typically means is that, as an employer I’m willing to train you on how to do this but it would be nice if you already knew how to.  
.  
.  

**Application**  
“Why you should hire me”  

So now that we understand what you as an applicant can offer and what the employer is looking for. Let’s communicate that to them!  

Do:  

* Include sample work done prior, as long as it is relevant!  
* Be concise but don’t skimp out on the important information  
* Review your application  
* Make sure that you have the minimum qualifications  
* Make sure that your resume’s layout is appropriate: clear font, legible, appropriate for the job  
* Place your strengths first, if you’re a student – education goes first with a summary of what you learnt in each class that is applicable in terms of competencies. If you are experienced, place your work history first (chronologically, summarize the relevant material but don’t skimp out on including juicy details)  
* Be honest with yourself, always  
* Use action words: achieved, organized, obtained
* Use [smart](http://www.dartmouth.edu/~hrs/profldev/performance_management/performance_objective.html) when communicating your achievements  
**Example of SMART**:  
Successfully executed and supported an effective XXX strategy to achieve XXX within X time period.    

Don’t:  

* Include protected property, any work that you’ve done for a company while under their employ will TYPICALLY belong to them, check your previous contract that you signed – you can get sued if you violate it
* Include company logos or indicators on previous works done if you are submitting  
* Lie about your experience, you will be caught eventually and it will suck for you and the employer
* Take the shotgun approach; it’s not a numbers game……  
* Send out generic cover letters, the layout is the same but please edit the material and content (if I see your company, my generic application sensor starts tingling)
* Be oblivious when contacted for a phone interview, know your applications and the positions and companies you applied to  
* Send out generic resumes; tailor your resume’s layout to the job posting. Highlight the competencies the employer is looking for first – if it’s not on the first page, it will most likely not be read!
* Send out a novel of a resume. You say you have excellent written communication skills? Prove it by summarizing your experience into a cover letter and resume without compromising the integrity of the information you’re conveying
