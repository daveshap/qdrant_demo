HELEN: Well, please excuse us! We...we haven't entertained a guest in...um...
CALVIN: Some time.
HELEN: What can I offer you, Eve?
ADAM: Mom? Eve and I have to go.
HELEN: What?
ADAM: I can't explain it now. But I want you to set the locks for two months. You have more than enough of everything. Then we'll be back to get you.
CALVIN: But, I don't understand.
ADAM: And, I'm asking you to trust me without understanding why.
CALVIN: Well, in that case...of course, son.
