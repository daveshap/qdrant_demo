PAINLESS: If a man isn't a man anymore, what's he got left to live for?
HAWKEYE: Tell me the whole story, Walt.
PAINLESS: There's this native broad works in the laundry. I don't know if you've noticed.
HAWKEYE: There's only one worth noticing.
PAINLESS: You noticed. I wasn't going to fool around over here. I've got these three girls I'm engaged to back home...
PAINLESS: But I had this feeling I ought to make the effort. To test myself. And I flunked.
HAWKEYE: What did you have to test, for God's sake... the dental Don Juan of Detroit?
PAINLESS: Don Juanism is just a cover... I've been reading up on it. I'm a fake, I'm a fraud, I've been living a lie!
HAWKEYE: Painless, you mustn't talk that way. It's a lot of crap. Cover for what?
PAINLESS: Homosexuality.
PAINLESS: Now I know that's been my problem since I was a kid. But it only caught up to me last night.
HAWKEYE: You've been drawn to other males? Since you were a kid?
PAINLESS: No, never in the slightest.
HAWKEYE: Just in dreams?
PAINLESS: Or in dreams either. I repressed it completely. Classic pattern of inhibition.
HAWKEYE: That's what you've been doing all these years with every dame you could lay your hands on? Repressing your real self?
PAINLESS: But it's all over now, and I can't face it. Imagine if you found out you were one, you wouldn't like breaking the news to your wife. Well, I got the same problem multiplied.
HAWKEYE: You don't have any problem. You've got thirty good years ahead of you, easy. Maybe you'll have to cut down as you grow older, get along with just two fiancees, but...
PAINLESS: No, one thing I finally know for sure, I'll never function with a woman again.
HAWKEYE: There ought to be a law against dentists reading. Matter of fact, I thought there was. Anyway, this is an obsession. He can't be persuaded out of it.
HO-JON: He's comin' this-a-way! The jaw- breaker!
DUKE: Y'all just act natural.
HAWKEYE: Get out the scotch, Ho-Jon. Don't mention the sex thing unless he brings it up.
DUKE: How you, Walt? We was just fixing to have a nightcap.
TRAPPER: Pour one for Painless.
