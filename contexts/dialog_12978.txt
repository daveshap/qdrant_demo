TATIANA: Why didn't you call your contacts in the army?
PAUL: I couldn't help.
TATIANA: You could have asked for a favor.
PAUL: No, I could not. What do you know about favors Tatiana, about barter and deals?
TATIANA: Victor was not a stranger, he was our neighbor.
PAUL: He was not family. Family is all that matters. Do you think if you or I were being dragged from here, any one of them would lift a finger to help us?
TATIANA: They do not have your connections.
PAUL: Connections? I have no connections, only favors. If I call to help Victor, a General will think Paul Rusesabagina is a fool. He thinks my favors are so numerous and so insignificant as to waste them on everybody." Then my hard work is doubly squandered. I insult the General and I do not get to use my favor at all. Please leave these things to my good judgment."
