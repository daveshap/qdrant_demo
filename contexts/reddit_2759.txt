I'm 21, and I'm making the best money I've ever made... but I don't think I want to do this job forever. What are my options?
I just started working with a commercial roofing company a few months ago at entry-level, and it pays the best I've ever made by far. However, I'm already beginning to feel as though I don't want to stay doing this forever, because I'm beginning to resent the fact that I never know when I'll be home, and I fear that there isn't much room for me to grow because I don't know if I'm ever going to be suited for a position where I am in charge of other people. I'm thinking of going back to school (I finished high school but that's it), partly to seek career growth but also because I feel I am bored and mentally understimulated. I'm not sure what to go back for though, and it's a difficult situation to try and go back because I need to work full time to support myself and my fiancee (her mental health struggles have been a barrier to her working up to this point, I am our sole income). I'd like to have a career that's more intellectually interesting, but I'd like a more stable schedule (roughly 40 hours most weeks, preferably). I have a bit of a STEM background from the advanced program I went through in high school, and think I might be interested in a career in biology or botany, but I am open to other fields of study, and I do enjoy being outdoors, but it seems that any outdoor job tends to have a more unpredictable schedule and/or less pay than I would prefer. What do y'all think, is it worth my while to explore other options, or should I just get over myself and stay where I'm at?

Edit: I'm located in Saukville, WI
