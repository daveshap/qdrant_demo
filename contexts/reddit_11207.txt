I don't know why I married my wife
We have been married for 5 years. I had doubts about doing it before our wedding, I had doubts our wedding day, I have doubts today. We are good friends, we have fun togheter, but I don't have desire for her. I look at her body and feel nothing; having sex is a chore I force myself to do once in a while. I always wanted to have kids, and I feel she doesn't want it. I don't have the guts to ask her, and I don't know what would be worst: never having kids or having kids with her (if I don't love her). Sometimes I fantasize about her dying or just leaving me, so I don't have to do anything.

Then again there are times when I look at her and fee a deep love for her.

It's complicated.
