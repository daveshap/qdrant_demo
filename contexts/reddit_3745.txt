How do you not take being "ghosted" personally?
Something as wonderful as dating, unfortunately, comes with the dreadful prospect of being "ghosted". How does someone go from "talking to you makes me feel like I've known you for years" to radio silence? And to add insult to injury, how do you not take that personally? 

The horrible thing about being "ghosted" is not the fact that a romance didnt spark, it's the ripping of the hope that we held out for your decency. And worst off, we make excuses for your newfound muteness. Then, we check our phones more than usual, hoping to hear from you or even see if you're online so we know that you're actually still alive. Only then, it hits us - you've decided to vanish. 

I wasted days thinking about someone who didnt value them. I think that's what it boils down to - the realisation that the high regard you held them to was not reciprocated. The late-night calls, the inside jokes, the secrets - they were personal. I take it personal because we made it personal.
