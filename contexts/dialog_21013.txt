POPPY: Do you think she will give us the designs?
ARGON: Eventually. These things are always a matter of leverage.
POPPY: And you think O'Brien is that leverage?
ARGON: That remains to be seen.
POPPY: And you still believe he's going to come here?
ARGON: Based on what we know of him, that would seem inevitable.
POPPY: Do you think she loves him?
ARGON: She must feel something for him. After all, she and I did create him.
