Job fired me for posting in the wrong server and not understanding a meme
To give some background. My job for whatever reason decided to go to discord to conduct business. I don't know why but they did. As someone who uses discord for themselves from playing games I sometimes have a hard time keeping track of who posted what. So I accidentally post this : " Or we can ask THE ARCHLICH OF NAXXRAMAS, ESTEEMED LICH LORD OF THE PLAGUELANDS, COMMANDER OF THE DREAD NECROPOLIS, MASTER AND FOUNDER OF THE CULT OF THE DAMNED, FORMERLY OF THE COUNCIL OF THE SIX, CREATOR OF THE ABOMINATION, CORRUPTOR OF THE SUNWELL, SUMMONER OF ARCHIMONDE THE DEFILER, BETRAYER OF HUMANITY, FOUNDER AND FIRST DARKMASTER OF THE SCHOLOMANCE, SCHOOL OF DARK ARTS AND NECROMANCY. CREATOR AND MASTER OF THE FOUR HORSEMEN. CORRUPTOR OF THE ASHBRINGER, HEARTHSTONE ENTHUSIAST AND CARING OWNER OF MR. BIGGLESWORTH THE CAT, THE MAJORDOMO TO THE LICH KING HIMSELF, KEL'THUZAD. " In an unofficial chat with some work acquaintances. My boss fired me because he thought this was a "direct threat to the company." For those who don't know it's a meme for a character from warcraft/heroes of the storm. Even after going in to explain the situation he acknowledged he learned that it was just a meme and stated he needed to "talk to his team" about the decision. What should I do? I'm worried he's goign to say I threatened the company and as someone who wants to be a teacher, I cannot have this happen. Any advice would be great or advice to help get my job back.
