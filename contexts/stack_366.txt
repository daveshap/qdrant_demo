Want to Install Windows 10 onto MacBookPro (15\Early 2011) running Sierra 10.12.6 My early 2011 15 inch MacBook Pro has 2.3 Intel Core i7, 8 GB memory, 750 GB SATA Disk and a SuperDrive. I completely erased the hard drive with Disk Utility and reinstalled os 10.12.6. My goal is to use this computer to run Windows with BootCamp, because my late 2009 iMac has become very burdened running Windows 7 in Parallels. I need Windows to use my accounting program. I will continue to use my iMac for everything else.So my first problem was that my Windows 7 key will not work. I purchased a Windows10 Home full version USB flash drive.Using Boot Camp I downloaded the Windows Drivers to the USB. The point was reached where a password was asked for, indicating that the installation of Windows was successful. But after I gave the password, the message was \"The installer disk could not be found. Insert Windows installer disk and wait for it to be recognized.\"Next I received some advice to burn the iso files to a DVD. I purchased a HD DVD-R with 15 GB. However, neither my iMac nor the MacBook Pro will perform the task. So I am seeing a lot of posts from people experiencing problems with the SuperDrive under Sierra.I would rather not go down this rabbit hole, so I am hoping there might be an answer that will work using the flash drive that I already have. Some of the answers that I read to similar questions seem really complicated; I hope that there might be a relatively easy fix
