How do I make up for a lack of relevant work experience when applying to jobs?
I'm finishing my Masters of Economics in the spring and I have no real relevant work experience to put down for financial analyst jobs that are asking for 1-3+ years of experience.

Aside from getting an internship, what can I do to 1) actually get an interview 2) stand a chance at landing a full-time job in May?

Any advice is very much appreciated.

Background: I was on the Pre-med track with a major in economics (pretty much a double major) which is why I never really had an internship in an office setting. I can code okayish in MatLab and I'm going to take a Python class after I finish my finals next week. I recently went to my school's career services department and they weren't much help at all.
