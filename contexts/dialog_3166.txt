KEVIN: Who do you think is the ugliest guy who ever lived.
DAVID: Well, Michael Bolton's pretty grisly.
KEVIN: I vote for Bart.
JENNIFER: Shut up, Kevin.
KEVIN: NO, seriously - I know he's your boyfriend, but there's something about his upper lip that is so weird. What do you think it is, Dad? Jen says it's a moustache, I say it's a cluster of about 11 mosquitoes, resting.
JENNIFER: You know the thing I hate most about children?
KEVIN: Nope.
JENNIFER: You.
