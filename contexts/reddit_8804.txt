What new information is contained in the 7/13 OSC indictments?
On Friday, the Special Counsel [indicted 12 Russian nationals](https://www.justice.gov/file/1080281/download) for an array of offenses related to interference in the 2016 presidential election, including a hack of the Democratic National Committee.

This indictment makes claim that ["Guccifer 2.0"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guccifer_2.0) was a handle used by Russian intelligence and in communique with an undisclosed American. However, this was [previously known,](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/11/us/politics/roger-stone-trump-adviser-russia.html) including the communications with an American, and doesn't seem to change how that event is viewed.

The hacking of state election systems was also [previously disclosed,](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/01/us/politics/russia-election-hacking.html) but this indictment offers more information than was previously known (I think, in regards to specific state systems).

*What information is actually new in the July 13th indictments? What information was previously known and the indictments corroborate? Does new information in the indictments change how events are understood to have happened?*
