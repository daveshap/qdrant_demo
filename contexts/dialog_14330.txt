MAX: It'll be more than that.
JACKIE: Don't be so literal. Ray believed it.
MAX: But you still have to show him the money at the airport.
JACKIE: Well, you know I'm not going to show him the whole amount. He'll see fifty thousand.
MAX: Where's the rest of it?
JACKIE: In the bag underneath.
MAX: What if he checks it?
JACKIE: He won't -- I mean, he didn't the last time. He'll be expecting fifty thousand and there it is -- on top.
MAX: You're takin' a helluva chance kid.
JACKIE: Not really. If he finds it, I say Mr. Walker put the money in, and I didn't know nothing about it. Like the coke.
MAX: Then you're out and you get nothing.
JACKIE: Yeah, but I'm not in jail and I tried.
MAX: You're gonna have surveillance all over you.
JACKIE: That's why you don't make a move till I come out of the fitting room.
MAX: In a dress.
JACKIE: Well, a suit. There's one I had my eye on.
