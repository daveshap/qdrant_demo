SETH: There's no why, Annie. I'm just not up for it. I never said I was.
ANNIE: Is there somebody else?
SETH: Nope.
ANNIE: You don't love me, is that it?
SETH: Nope.
ANNIE: How about ... you're too narcissistic to commit to another human being in a long- term way.
SETH: That's good.
SUZY: Five minutes in the microwave. Any one of them, five minutes and done. Ready to eat. Do you know how to make juice?
SAM: Microwave. Five minutes.
ANNIE: You take the microwave?
SETH: What am I going to do with a microwave?
ANNIE: You turn it on, you open it and you stand in front of it for a very long time.
SETH: So you're angry. Big deal.
