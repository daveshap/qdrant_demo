What does Bayesian Comparison of Groups and Posterior Interval say about my Hypothesis? I am comparing the score of two groups: A and B. The score is normally distributed and a two sample t-test yields a p-value >0.05. Therefore I have to reject the Hypothesis that there is significant difference between the mean score of both groups.However, I also conducted a comparison of groups and posterior confidence intervals according to the Bayesian approach and I need clarification on how to properly interpret the results:The \"mean of the reference group\" (A) is 208 and the \"difference to the reference group\" is 13 (Sigma 29). The 90% posterior confidence interval ranges from -5 to 30, the 75% posterior interval ranges from 0.4 to 26.-Can I say that participants of group B perform 12 points better on average than participants of group A? -Must the hypothesis be rejected as the 90% confidence interval contains zero? Or can it be interpreted as \"In 90% of the cases, participants of the experimental group score somewhere between 5 points less and 29 points higher than the control group\"-Can the 75% confidence interval be interpreted as \"In 75% of the cases participants of Group B score between 0.4 and 24 points higher than participants of Group A\"?
