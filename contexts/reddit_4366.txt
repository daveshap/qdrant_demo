Last week I wanted to jump off a bridge. Today I think WTF was I thinking?
Remember when you're feeling suicidal with depression to think of it as having the flu. Take time off ....then remember to be compassionate with yourself. After that strangle the imaginary parrot on your shoulder who's putting you down 24/7. The main thing? Give yourself an extra week or few days before you think of doing anything drastic.
