Sick of hearing ‘it gets better’
I don’t care!! 

I’m not only suicidal for my ‘temporary’ problems, I find life in general as simply meaningless and pointless. Even if things got better I wouldn’t want to live on this shitty planet, we all die in the end anyway. And my chronic pain isn’t gonna get better ever. I don’t want to change the world and I don’t care if people have it worse, so stop trying to guilt me.
