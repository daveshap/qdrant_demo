5v 10amp powering arduino and LED strip I need my 5v 10 amp power supply to power both my LED strip and arduino.<br>I will have the LED strip directly wired to the power supply, then for the arduino I have two ideas - either cut a USB cable and connect its power/ground wires to the power supply, or wire the 5v/ground pins of the arduino to the power supply.<br>My question is would 10 amps be too much to give an arduino through either of these two ways? Using the 5v pin to power the arduino is unregulated, but I'm not sure if this is relevant to amps or just volts? My understanding is that the arduino and components plugged into the arduino will only draw as much amps as they need. I know the strip can handle the amps, but can the arduino? It will only be connected to a basic LCD display and joystick to control the colors.
