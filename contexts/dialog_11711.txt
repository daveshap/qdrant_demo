JOHN: He found you, didn't he?
KERI: Get on the bus.
JOHN: Where's Molly? She's not in her room...
KERI: Just get on the bus.
JOHN: I'm not leaving without her.
KERI: John, you can't help her now.
JOHN: What? Where is she?
KERI: John...
JOHN: Oh, God... no... not Molly.
KERI: Please, get on the bus...
WILL: Keri, you all right?
KERI: We've got to get these kids out of here...
WILL: I'll make sure there's no kids left in the dorms...
