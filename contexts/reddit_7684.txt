Which degree is more in demand/offers more career opportunities, an MA in IR or an MPA?
Tried posting at r/askacademia since I want to go into academia as a lecturer, but it was removed after one guy complained and am waiting for mod response. So, I’ll try here.

So, TL;DR deadline day is coming up for me to choose on Sol Price at SC for my MPA or do my MA IR at NYU. SC will be slightly cheaper, but price isn’t a big factor to me as much as career prospects. From posting over at r/gradschool and a couple other forums it seems like MPA is more in demand and offers more diverse options, but I’m not sure. I want to go into politics longterm, but want to lecture at the uni level in the interim.

Background- MA linguistics Glasgow uni.
