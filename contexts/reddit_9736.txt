Supplemental Questions on SA Job Applications
I'm currently job searching in SA after a rather long break from SA (roughly 5 years, because childcare is expensive in san francisco). I've noticed since my last job search efforts in 2014/15 that there's now an industry hiring standard in SA job applications to ask supplemental questions, mostly along the lines of diversity, but some are along the lines of other topics related to the job. Is this just an anomaly common in the geographical area I'm searching for jobs (Pacific Northwest) or is this common all across the country? I'm looking at both entry level SA jobs and mid-level jobs, because my experience puts me on the cusp of both those levels... yay. I kinda expect it more for upper level jobs, and not so much for fresh out of grad school jobs. 

What is the thought around this? I feel like it's half to weed out numerous applications, and half to get to know the candidate even better before you even call them for the phone interview. At the rate I'm going applying for jobs, I'm going to have a book's worth of material to write answering the supplemental questions (that's supposed to be funny, not whining!).
