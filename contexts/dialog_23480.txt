TILNEY: Like you, I found him not at home!
WILL: So this is the favour you find in the Chamberlain's Men.
ROSALINE: Will!
WILL: I would have made you immortal. Tell Burbage he has lost a new play by Will Shakespeare.
TILNEY: What does Burbage care of that? He is readying the Curtain for Kit Marlowe.
WILL: You have opened the playhouses?
TILNEY: I have, Master Shakespeare.
WILL: But the plague
TILNEY: Yes, I know. But he was always hanging around the house.
