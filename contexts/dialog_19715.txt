NIXON: On the list of horribles, I know what he is. And I know what he tracks back to. You say he was involved in the Plumbers?
HALDEMAN: Definitely. Colson had him trying to break into Bremer's apartment after Bremer shot Wallace, to plant McGovern campaign literature.
NIXON: I had nothing to do with that. Was he ... in the Ellsberg thing?
HALDEMAN: Yes, you approved it, sir.
NIXON: I did?
HALDEMAN: It was right after the Pentagon Papers broke. They went in to get his psychiatric records.
NIXON: Fucking hell.
HALDEMAN: We were working on China.
