Can my job make me kill a Mouse/Spider/Etc
I work in a restaurant and the other day there was a mouse in the kitchen. I was told by my boss to kill it, even though i was able to get it outside with a cup, which i did. But my boss threatened to write me up for not killing it.

I'm asking this because i dont agree with killing animals like that. If im able to get them outside, i will do that. 

I also ask about spiders because i have been told to kill spiders at previous jobs as well. But they never threatened to write me up for not killing it.
