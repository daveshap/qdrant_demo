This is my 100%
This is my 100%. If you don’t like it leave. This is all that I can give. Appreciate me for what I have to offer and don’t expect more of someone who is drowning inside their own brain. I refuse to be the girl who caters to a mans every need. Appreciate me for what I have to offer. Appreciate my brain. Value my compassion. This is who i am and this is everything I have to give. If you want more you can find it elsewhere. Someday, someone will want me. They will appreciate me for the person that I have become and love me for my strength and flare. But right now- this is all I have. If it isn’t enough then walk away.
