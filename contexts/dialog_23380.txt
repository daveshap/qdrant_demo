GREGORY: This is about another murder —— a woman at Fifty Second Street
MARY: But you do believe me?
GREGORY: The important thing is, the police won't believe you.
MARY: I saw him on the floor. He was cut -— --here. The blood was running out. He was dead. I'm sure of it. Then on the subway I saw him —— white —— and the men holding him up between them.
GREGORY: Yes, of course —— but the police would say you'd probably had a bad dream.
MARY: He was a kind little man in his way —— and I made him go down that hall into the darkness. I made him do it.
GREGORY: Drink your milk.
