LOKI: Ooh, that's a good one! You could charge Halfdan fifteen for that one.
KEITEL: Yes, it is good. But I told him ten.
LOKI: You could charge him what you like.
LOKI: You just can't make enough swords and spears and knives and daggers to satisfy the demand. You could charge Halfdan twenty and he'd pay it.
KEITEL: Oh, I couldn't do that! The Blacksmith's Code says...
LOKI: Yes yes... of course.... the Blacksmith's Code"..."
LOKI: If this IS the Age of Ragnarok, Keitel Blacksmith, it is GOOD to us.
KEITEL: Can't make enough swords!
KEITEL: Can't make enough axe-heads!
LOKI: But, Keitel, if Erik ever finds the Horn Resounding... if he ever crosses Bi-Frost, the Rainbow Bridge... if he ever wakens the gods..
KEITEL: They chase Fenrir the Wolf from the sky...
LOKI: The Age of Ragnarok ends...
KEITEL: The bottom falls out of the sword business!
LOKI: It's not just YOUR livelihood that's at stake but your son's, and the livelihood of ALL blacksmiths.
KEITEL: My brother blacksmiths!
LOKI: That's right.
KEITEL: The Blacksmith's Code says I must...
LOKI: Honour and protect all blacksmiths.
KEITEL: Together we stand!
LOKI: You can't let Erik do THAT.
THORFINN'S MUM: And you've got BOTH axes?
THORFINN: Yes, Mother.
THORFINN'S MUM: And something to sharpen them with?
THORFINN: Yes, Mum.
THORFINN'S MUM: And don't forget: never let your enemy get behind you.
THORFINN: No, Mother.
THORFINN'S MUM: And keep your sword greased.
THORFINN: Yes, Mother. Goodbye, Dad.
