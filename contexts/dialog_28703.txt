EPPS: We can't just sit here. We've got to start moving, so pick.
JAEGER: You sure you want me too?
JAEGER: I pick that way.
EPPS: Okay. Then we go this way.
JAEGER: Getting cold.
EPPS: It's a desert. That's what deserts do at night; they get cold.
JAEGER: Epps...Epps! I'm gonna stop for a second.
EPPS: No!
JAEGER: Just let me rest for a second.
EPPS: We've got to keep moving while there's still light.
JAEGER: You know what I'm going to do? I'm just going to take a second. I want to look at the gold.
EPPS: Don't you touch it.
JAEGER: I just want to look at it. Remind me of what I'm dying for.
EPPS: The deal was no one touches it until we get out of here.
JAEGER: Yeah, but we made that deal while Wes was still alive. He's gone. Time for a new deal.
