Happy New Year!?
Sooo my life is a total mess atm. On new year's eve me and my friends went  for a drink .Drunk too much said things I shouldn't have to a girl.The  next day one of my friends whom I considered close showed some of the text messages I sent him about that girl to her bf and her. So yeah we wont be hearing from him in a while (my "friend")
So know everyone in the group knows what I did and the keep mocking me what do I do?
(Dont say things like ask the to stop it wont work OBVIOUSLY)
