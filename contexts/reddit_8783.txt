How did the 1994 Crime Bill affect black/minority communities?
I've recently seen a lot of news about [Joe Biden's history of enacted bills and the subsequent affect that had on communities](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/6/20/18677998/joe-biden-1994-crime-bill-law-mass-incarceration). 

So I was wondering the following:

* What data do we have that the crime bill was a positive/negative?
* How did the 1994 crime bill affect black/minority communities?
