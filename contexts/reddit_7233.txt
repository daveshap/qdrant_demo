Going to start working at a gas station soon. I've never smoked or played the lottery before, what are some terms customers use when requesting specific cigarettes and/or lottery tickets that I should be aware of?
My store does not sell alcohol, but has a large selection of tobacco products that I'm wholly unfamiliar with. I'm prepared for the job otherwise, but are there any names that aren't specifically listed that people use for certain products which I should be aware of?
