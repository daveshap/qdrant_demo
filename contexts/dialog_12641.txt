BARRY: What the fuck is that?
ROB: What?
BARRY: I heard you, man. Don't give me that what" shit. You just told them that you're gonna put out a record with them."
ROB: So? You even said they're good.
BARRY: HELLO. DO YOU SEE ANYONE ELSE around here with a band, Mr. Branson? Mr. Phil Spector?
LAURA: Hey, Barry.
BARRY: Oh, hi.
LAURA: Where's Rob?
BARRY: The Malcolm McClaren of Clark Street is in his executive suite. Do you have an appointment?
LAURA: What are you talking about?
BARRY: Just that Rob seems to think it would be wiser to start a record label by putting out a record with business- crippling Nazi Youth shoplifters than with someone he knows in his bitter jealous heart is a musical visionary. That's all.
ROB: Hi.
LAURA: Hi. What are you doing?
ROB: Nothing.
LAURA: Wanna go to dinner?
ROB: Where?
LAURA: At Paul and Miranda's. Paul from work.
ROB: Oh. Well. We don't really get along. Paul and I.
LAURA: I know. But you've never met. It just seems like a stone unturned in your relationship with him.
ROB: Ha.
