AIDE and OSSEC conflicts? Being fairly new to both AIDE and OSSEC I've been trying to find out if there are any potential conflicts in having them both installed on one host (CentOS 7.5). It seems like they could work as a multi-layered approach, but I haven't been able to find much about running the in tandem. And of course would there be a difference in running them OSSEC locally vs. an agent on the machine with AIDE? Thanks.
