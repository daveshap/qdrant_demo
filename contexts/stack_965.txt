How do I efficiently find my terminal window in GNOME Shell? I like to work with many open terminal windows at the same time. At work I have to cope with Windows, but I use Ubuntu at home. Sadly, the experience of finding a specific terminal window on GNOME is much worse in GNOME than in Windows. In Windows, I can hover over the mini-preview on the bottom of my screen and the real windows is overlayed semi-transparently so I know exactly which window this is. Even more important, the ordering of the terminals always stays the same.GNOME just gives me the mini-preview where I can't read the contents, so I have to click first and find out it was the wrong one later. Even worse, more often than not on my next try the ordering is different than before and I find myself trying the same wrong window more than once, making it very hard to continue working where this should be elementary.Are there any GNOME Shell extensions or settings to improve this workflow?
