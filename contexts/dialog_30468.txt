JORGE: If you wake first, wake me up.
LUCIA: What are you going to do?
JORGE: What I do every day, but I want to do it earlier.
LUCIA: You're happy, aren't you!
JORGE: Shouldn't I be? You, on the other hand ...
LUCIA: I'm bored. I'm alone all day and I don't know what to do.
JORGE: You should have enough to do in this house ... Come here and listen to this.
JORGE: What are you thinking about?
LUCIA: That your cousin is more to your taste.
JORGE: She isn't my cousin.
LUCIA: It doesn't make any difference what she is: you like her.
