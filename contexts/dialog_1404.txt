PINKERTON: It's early in the game yet, Mr. Rains. Jesse James and I are just learning how each other moves, feeling out each other's patterns.
RAINS: I'm losing millions of dollars and months of time while you play chess with these farmers!
PINKERTON: Hardly farmers. I've done some checking. All these were in the War. These men know sabotage, tactics, and have four years of bloody fighting experience behind them. They are disciplined, well-trained and have a charismatic leader. If I were to design the perfect outlaw band, this gang is what I would create.
RAINS: So you can't tell me anything?
PINKERTON: It's going to be a long winter.
