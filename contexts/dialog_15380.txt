PETER: I'm just curious.
KATHY: I think it's best if we don't ask too many personal questions -- I want to keep things on a professional level.
PETER: You mean like in the steam room?
KATHY: That's not fair!
PETER: Are you going to tell me you didn't feel something in there?
KATHY: You're projecting your own desires and reading more into what happened than what actually did.
PETER: Very good. Spoken like a true psychologist. When confronted with the prospect of your own reality, hide behind quotations. What is that Masters and Johnson?
KATHY: You have to win every point, don't you?
PETER: I just wanted to know if you're involved with anyone? Let me ask you something? Do your colleagues know if you're involved or not?
KATHY: Of course.
PETER: Why?
KATHY: Because I work with them.
