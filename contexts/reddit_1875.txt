Juniors, do shit in advance. I promise you'll be grateful
Among the simplest things you can do and 100% will benefit from, these:
- Start our Common App account, fill in the info
- Start your CSS profile, fill in the info - ESPECIALLY my international comrades, it's a pain in the ass to know what all that long-ass list of Americanisms convert to (hint: most other countries have no benefits)
- Start your CA essay, maybe even make 2 to have more choices
- Start your "Why Major" and "Elaborate on an EC" supplements. Around 200 words
- Look for the particular programs that you'll want to mention in your probable "Why us" essay

Edit: happy to see y'all's RemindMes
