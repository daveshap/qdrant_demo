STAR MAN: I told you goodbye. Why are you here?
JENNY: The police are waiting for you up ahead. There's a roadblock. You have to go back.
STAR MAN: This car will take me to Las Vegas. I cannot go back.
JENNY: The police know about Lathrop Wells. We have to go another way. Come on.
STAR MAN: If I don't meet the ship, my people will go home without me.
JENNY: Please understand. If you go this way, you'll never get to your ship. The police know about Lathrop Wells. We have to go another way. I'll get you to your ship. I promise.
STAR MAN: I will go. But not you.
JENNY: You shit! I'll decide if I go or not. Not you. I don't know what you do on your planet, but I didn't think that was very nice walking out on me like you did.
STAR MAN: I don't want you to be hurt.
JENNY: Come on.
