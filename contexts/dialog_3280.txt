DELIA: I can't believe you are doing this to me! <u>Ghosts</u>. I am giving a dinner party for seven people tonight. Otho has agreed to come back for the demolition of the attic. My agent, Bernard, is bringing some woman who writes for <u>Architectural Digest</u>. In fact, no one here tonight has not been in <u>Vanity Fair</u>. Except you.
LYDIA: I <u>told</u> them you were too mean to be afraid.
DELIA: Don't you <u>dare</u> talk to others about me. I'm an <u>artist</u>! The only thing that scares me is being embarrassed in front of my friends. Do you know how hard it is to get civilized people to set foot in this part of Connecticut? Not a solitary word of this pubescent tripe to anyone.
BARBARA: Lydia's trying, but they don't believe her.
ADAM: She's got <u>photos</u>, Barbara.
BARBARA: Adam, you had a photo of Big Foot!
ADAM: This is different. Eventually she'll take someone to the attic. And then what? We've got to try to contact this guy Betelmyer. We gotta get some help, hon.
BARBARA: Did you copy these gravestones right, Adam?
ADAM: Of course I did.
BARBARA: Then it should be here.
