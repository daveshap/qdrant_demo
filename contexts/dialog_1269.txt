JESSICA: Ah, you'll get her back soon enough. That's easy, she likes you. What you need to do is learn to press a girl's buttons. You gotta give her what she's never had.
KEVIN: What?
JESSICA: I'll give you a hint. Ohhh
KEVIN: You mean...and orgasm?
JESSICA: You got it, stud.
KEVIN: Well...I'm pretty sure I've --
JESSICA: No you haven't.
KEVIN: But that one time --
JESSICA: No.
KEVIN: Well of course I'd want to give her that. I mean, what do you think, I don't care about her?
JESSICA: Do you?
KEVIN: Of course.
JESSICA: Do you love her?
KEVIN: I -- I don't know, you can't ask me that.
JESSICA: Well, if you want to get her in the sack, tell her you love her. That's how I was duped.
KEVIN: I don't want to dupe her, Jessica. If I say it, I have to be sure I mean it.
JESSICA: Well it's up to you. The Big L, or the Big O.
