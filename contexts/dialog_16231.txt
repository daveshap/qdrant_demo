NICK: How much did you say it was, Tom?
TOM: You know how much it is, Nick.
NICK: And that does include the amp?
TOM: You know it doesn't include the amp.
TOM: What have you come as?
SOAP: Cupid stupid! That's the last time I am getting any more fruit off you Tom. Call that fresh? There was more small hairy armoured things in your fruit than there was fruit. You should open a butcher's, not a grocer's.
TOM: If you will order stuff that comes from Kat-Man-Fucking-Du don't be surprised if your fruit picks up a few tourists en route. ~ Never mind that, what about the money?
SOAP: Get your fingers out of my soup!
TOM: Soap is called Soap because he likes to keep his hands clean of any unlawful behaviour. He is proud of his job, and even more proud that it's legal.
BACON: He's a stroppy sod but he's got more balls than a golfer, only he doesn't know it. ' * Cut from completed film.
EDDY: Are you sure you can afford twenty-five?
SOAP: Well that depends on how you look at it. I can afford it as long as I see it again, if that's what you mean. You got the rest from the fat man and Bacon?
TOM: Who's this fat man, then?
EDDY: Bacon, the fat man and myself, and it's time to make a call to Harry.
HATCHET: You got it all?
EDDY: A hundred grand.
TOM: You see it's not easy to take a seat at this table; the money involved has to be a hundred grand upwards and there is no shortage of punters.
EDDY: The man who decides if you can play is this man Harry, or Hatchet Harry as some including himself like to call him.
