Quantum fluctuations producing CMB fluctuations also cause inflation to be eternal? It is believed that quantum fluctuations in the inflaton field caused inflation to end at different times in different places, which led to CMB fluctuations (1 part in 100,000).Eternal inflation also relies on quantum fluctuations in the inflaton field causing inflation to end at different times.But the fluctuations in the CMB are tiny and the fluctuations in eternal inflation are large. $~$Are quantum fluctuations in these two scenarios really the same process?
