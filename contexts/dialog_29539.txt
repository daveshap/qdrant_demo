BEING: Bring me the ship or I will destroy you!
SYBOK: The ship....
BEING: Bring it closer so that I might join with it. Do it, or watch these puny things die horribly.

KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise. Listen carefully...
SYBOK: Spock...
SPOCK: Sybok.
SYBOK: This is my doing. This is my arrogance... my vanity...
SPOCK: Sybok, we must find a way...
SYBOK: No. You must save yourselves. Forgive me, brother. Forgive me.
SYBOK: I couldn't help but notice you pain.
BEING: My pain?
SYBOK: It runs deep. Share it with me.
