First "formal" job that I feel I am not qualified for
Hey everyone, I am a uni student who has just luckily landed a work-study job in my school. It is literally my first formal job in English, which is not my first language. On top of that, I feel like I am not quite qualified for the position since I am not very confident about my language and project management skills. Any tips and advice on how to become a professional employee would be appreciated, thanks in advance!
