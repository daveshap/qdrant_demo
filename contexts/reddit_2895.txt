CRAZINESS OCCURRED ON FRIDAY. What would you guys do in my shoes??
HEY. I'm going to speak in short sentences to be as concise as possible. Let's go:

25yo male. Bachelors in management, MBA in business admin. Working in healthcare for the past 3 years. Year 1 was an IT analyst (basically just desktop support). Year 2 was IT manager (more desktop support, telling specialists to handle tickets, meet with heads to see if IT could help, nothing special tbh). Year 3 (now) I am an account supervisor for another healthcare company. They are all about enrolling doctors, nurses, and other healthcare providers into insurance plans. I just make sure my team of 7 completes their tasks and sends out those applications to enroll providers. Nothing special again. I love IT because I love fixing shit and researching new processes, so this job kind of sucks because its very... "lame" to me. **OK NOW THE CRAZY PART BEGINS. You need to know the aforementioned into before proceeding:**

Director pulls me in on Friday. Has a piece of paper in her hand. She's smiling and looks at me and asks "can you explain this?". I look at the paper. Its my resume which I LEFT IN HER PRINTER SOMEHOW. FOR AN INTERVIEW I HAD EARLIER THAT SAME DAY. I mention straight up that im interviewing. And that its for the money. Really. I said it straight up. She laughs and says she completely understands. She asked how much they offering. I said 75K. I'm currently making 60K. I also tell her my 2 hour daily commute is brutal. She says she'll talk to the CEO and get back to me MONDAY (the next business day). 10 MINUTES AFTER THIS CONVERSATION, she calls me in and says we would like to offer you 75K to stay, and up to 2 days to work from home.

Guys, my mind was blown away. I have this job that I am not passionate about paying me a very nice amount (and its very easy - almost a joke), while I'm here looking for something in IT because well... I like IT. But now I'm thinking if I should just stay.

SOS  
  
**UPDATE^1:**  The other company has offered 73K. My current company is offering 75K + WfH. Welp.  
**UPDATE^2:**  Next day. Leaning towards staying. Think I should push for more money???
