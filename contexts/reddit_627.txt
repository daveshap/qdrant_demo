A lot has been going on and I’m stuck.
I never thought I would ever be in this position, but I am so here we go:

Some context — I’m a middle class person of color (15M) who lives in the United States. I go to a super preppy, expensive as hell, private school (got in on a partial scholarship). You can probably expect that there’s not that much diversity, which is where my first problem arises. I’ve heard a lot of people talk about this before where they ‘find their people’ but there is not a single other person in my grade who looks or talks like me. I don’t feel in place at all.
 On top of that, school has been really stressful recently. I haven’t been doing poorly, but it’s super stressful. It seems like these things are temporary problems but I feel like the reality is that it continues throughout high school if I don’t address it, and maybe it might chase me for the rest of my life. 

Oh, and on top of all that, I have some serious problems at home on both sides of my family. My sister is super spoiled (goes to the same school, but has been there for longer) and she has lost all respect for our parents who sent her there. She’s just plain nasty to them and it hurts me. Also, my uncle on my mom’s side is struggling with obesity and had a heart issue recently (he’s in the hospital rn), and my uncle on my dad’s side is an extreme alcoholic who’s had liver failure and probably gonna die before his parents.

Meanwhile i’m stuck in between all this. If you were amazing enough to read all of this, I could really use some help. Everything is appreciated. <3
