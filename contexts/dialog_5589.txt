PETER: Oh, forgive me. Is this yours?
REGGIE: It's hers. Where'd you find him, robbing a bank?
PETER: He was throwing snowballs at Baron Rothschild. We don't know each other, do we?
REGGIE: Why, do you think we're going to?
PETER: I don't know -- how would I know?
REGGIE: I'm afraid I already know a great many people. Until one of them dies I couldn't possibly meet anyone else.
PETER: Yes, of course. But you will let me know if anyone goes on the critical list
REGGIE: Quitter.
PETER: How's that?
REGGIE: You give up awfully easy, don't you?
