Education Career Advice: Best way to start a career with a BA degree. MD, USA
I have a BA degree in Sociology, and have been teaching in the Philippines for 2 years as a high school social science and research teacher (private school does not require certification). I recently moved to MD, USA and plan to continue my career in teaching. However, I am in need of work to support myself and possibly my studies to take required courses to be a licensed teacher. I am not familiar with USA’s work opportunities yet so any help on what best steps to take would be appreciated. I’ve checked Indeed and have applied to some Paraprofessional/assistant teacher work, which usually pays for 13-16$ an hour, but have not received any response yet. Did I do the right thing? Do you recommend any work/career paths? Any help would be appreciated :) thank you!
