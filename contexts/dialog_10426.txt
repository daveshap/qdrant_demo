ARNOLD: I capture Quebec leading an Army by river fordings through Maine... If we don't do it, the British will come down Champlain, take back Ticonderoga and attack us in the spring.
WASHINGTON: You'd have to travel hundreds of miles through the wilderness.
ARNOLD: Over three hundred miles.
WASHINGTON: You seem pleased by the prospect.
ARNOLD: Exceedingly. Besides, if I had half the wagons that were used to lug the rum to Philadelphia for this congress, I could move a whole army to the moon!
WASHINGTON: What's your frank estimation of the British?
ARNOLD: Well, you fought with them against the French and Iroquois, how good were they then?
WASHINGTON: They died well. Otherwise, they didn't do much right. But if we have war, the British will surely send their best troops: right now they have no other enemies.
ARNOLD: And a French alliance?
WASHINGTON: Ben Franklin's going to Paris, but I think the French will be long on talk and short on guns. Our troops are mobs, they won't take orders, have no equipment... could they beat the British?
ARNOLD: It comes down to leaders. If our leaders are ordinary men who truly believe; if they go into the forests with the troops, eat what they eat, fight with them, perhaps to die? The most common soldier will defy your most depressing expectation.
