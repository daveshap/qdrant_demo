Love animals but can’t see blood
So I’m a high schooler and I’m nearing my senior year so I should really know what I wanna study in college. I love animals so working with them is my dream. Problem is I can’t see blood, not even a drop.. so that cancels out being a vet. Also my dad really just wants me to have a “regular job” and doesn’t think working with animals is going to support me. Soooo if anyone can list me job opportunities that work with animals as well as required education it would be gladly appreciated.
