PAULA: Lynette, where's Sid?
LYNETTE: Already come and gone. Can you believe it? He DORed in the twelfth week. How can you win?
ZACK: What did you tell him about the baby?
LYNETTE: That there isn't one, as of today. I had my period. I couldn't believe it. He still wanted to marry me.
ZACK: And you turned him down??
LYNETTE: Of course. I don't want no Okie from Muscogee. I can get that right here in Port Angeles.
ZACK: You little bitch! How could you? Was there ever a baby, Lynette? That's all I want to know! Did you make up that baby, Lynette? Did you??
LYNETTE: Of course there was a baby. I'd never lie about something like that. Would I, Paula?
