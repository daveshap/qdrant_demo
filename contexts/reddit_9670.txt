Post-critical incident debriefing activity for weekly staff meeting
This coming week, I am slated to lead the professional development activity in our weekly pro staff meeting. Just over a week ago, we had a major incident on campus involving physical violence between two students and everyone present at the activity I'll be leading responded to this incident. I would like to facilitate some sort of discussion about people's emotional (or physical) response to this type of incident. Any suggestions of a good 10-ish minute activity that could help with this? Thanks!
