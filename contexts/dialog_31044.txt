SAILOR: You okay, honey?
LULA: That woman's laugh creeps me out. I heard somethin' like that... somewhere before... Sound'd like the wicked witch...
SAILOR: Just sounded like an old gal havin' a good time to me... You ready to dance?
LULA: I'm always ready to dance. But I need me a kiss first, honey. Just one?
SANTOS: I knew you'd want it again...
MARIETTA: That's not why I called.
SANTOS: Oh yeah - sure... okay.
MARIETTA: Santos... It isn't.
SANTOS: Have it your way... But you want it.
MARIETTA: Lula's gone off with Sailor.
SANTOS: What do you want me to do about it?
MARIETTA: I want you to take care of Sailor, so he won't ever be able to bother my baby again.
SANTOS: Take care of him?
MARIETTA: Yes.
SANTOS: What does take care of him mean? Do you want me to give him food or some clothing?
MARIETTA: What's with you? You know what take care of him means. I don't call Santos except for one big reason.
SANTOS: Big is the key word, and I'm telling you I want it bad.
MARIETTA: I want you to get rid of Sailor.
SANTOS: Get rid of him?
MARIETTA: Yes... Get rid of him.
SANTOS: How would I do that? Send him on a trip - like maybe to Hawaii?
MARIETTA: Santos, why in hell do you insist on playin' this stupid game?
SANTOS: Just tell me what you want.
MARIETTA: I don't need to explain anymore'n I have... You know damn well.
SANTOS: You need to explain it.
MARIETTA: All right... I want you... to... kill... Sailor... As simple as that.
SANTOS: Simple? Kill him? How?
MARIETTA: That's your business... I don't care how.
SANTOS: Like an accident where maybe Lula might also get hurt?
MARIETTA: NO... For God's sakes, Santos!
SANTOS: Well, like kill him with the atomic bomb?
MARIETTA: Santos...
SANTOS: Explain it... I told you.
MARIETTA: Shoot him.
SANTOS: Shoot him? Like with a gun?
MARIETTA: Yes.
SANTOS: Where? In the leg?
MARIETTA: No.
SANTOS: Where?
MARIETTA: In the head.
SANTOS: Shoot Sailor in the head with a gun... Now I'm beginning to get it... You want me to shoot Sailor in the head with a gun.
MARIETTA: Yes.
SANTOS: But where in the head? Not the chin, I hope.
MARIETTA: No... In the brains... What little I'm sure he has.
SANTOS: You want me to shoot Sailor in the brains with a gun.
MARIETTA: Yes.
SANTOS: Through the forehead?
MARIETTA: Yes.
SANTOS: Wrong! It's much better to blow a hole in the back of the head... right toward the bridge of the nose... Lots and lots of irreparable damage.
MARIETTA: See! I knew you had it all under control.
SANTOS: Why didn't you send Johnnie Farragut?
MARIETTA: Maybe I did... Try New Orleans first... Lula can't ever stop talkin' 'bout that town.
SANTOS: On one condition...
SANTOS: You give me your permission to kill Johnnie Farragut.
MARIETTA: Santos... No... Please, Santos...
SANTOS: You're not tellin' me that you're sweet on him?
MARIETTA: No... But...
SANTOS: One day he's gonna find out what we're up to with Mr. Reindeer, and he could cause us a lot of trouble.
SANTOS: I'm gonna take your silence as a yes"..."
MARIETTA: Santos... I can't...
SANTOS: Shhhh... It's all right... Also, I either take you or that pretty daughter of yours to bed.
MARIETTA: You fucker, don't you ever touch Lula - You fucker, I'll kill you.
SANTOS: Put your shoulders back.
MARIETTA: What?
SANTOS: Put your shoulders back, I said.
SANTOS: You got nice tits.
MARIETTA: Someone's gonna see us.
SANTOS: That's just another part of the price to pay.
MARIETTA: Santos... You kill that Sailor, otherwise he's gonna turn my baby against me.
