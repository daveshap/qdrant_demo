ANDREWS: I'll be going. Ellie swallows her drink and starts pouring herself another, as King enters.
ELLIE: Well, if it isn't the groom himself! You're just in time, King.
KING: How are you, Ellie? Are you happy?
ELLIE: Happy? Why shouldn't I be happy? I'm getting the handsomest man in captivity. Here you are, King. Let's drink. Let's drink to us . We finally made it, didn't we?
KING: You bet we did.
ELLIE: It's up to you now. I want our life to be full of excitement, King. We'll never let up, will we? Never a dull moment. We'll get on a merry-go-round and never get off. Promise you'll never let me get off? It's the only way to live, isn't it? No time to think. We don't want to stop to think, do we? Just want to keep going.
KING: Whatever you say, darling.
ELLIE: I heard about your stunt. That's swell, King. Just think of itâ€”the groom lands on the lawn with a plane. It's a perfect beginning for the life we're going to lead. It sets just the right tempo. Come on, King. You're lagging.
