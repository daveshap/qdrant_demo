Never-ending string kebab for a dystopian future For a Matrix-type future I want to feed people via solid food. This is to keep all their internal organs working properly.The idea is to feed them an endless kebab that is held together along its length with a string. They aren't aware of this as they are living in a fantasy simulated world.There is no need to chew the kebab as it is digestible as is.Waste is expelled in the normal way and happens autonomously although it may be arranged to coincide with bowel movements in the simulated world.The string supporting the kebab is continuously pulled at a slow rate through the digestive system to allow digestion to take place.QuestionWill the string that is threaded through the gut from mouth to anus actually be practicable or will it interfere with anything along the way? Are there any other drawbacks? Is there an easy way to balance the feed-through speed with the amount of nutrition per unit length of string?NoteThe string is on a never-ending loop so it is cleaned in disinfectant before it comes around again to the mouth once more coated in kebabulite.
