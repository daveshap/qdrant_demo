You guys know that Swiping Right 100% of the time gets your Tinder profile shadowbanned, right?
I thought this was common knowledge, but everyday I see guys complain that they swipe right on every girl and get no matches.

Its because that makes the algorithm assume you are a bot, and hides your profile from everyone else.  You can log in and swipe like normal but nothing will happen.  Even just swiping too often lowers your visibility.

Just be more selective.  Theres no way you would actually want to meet up with 100% of the people on the app anyway.  Have some self respect, bros and sisses
