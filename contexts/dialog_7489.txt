HANS: Mr. Mystery Guest. Are you still there?
MCCLANE: I wouldn't think of leaving, Hans. Unless you want to open the front door...?
HANS: I'm afraid not. But you have me at a loss -- you know my name, but who are you? Just another American who saw too many movies as a child. Another orphan of a bankrupt culture who thinks he's John Wayne...Rambo... Marshal Dillion.
MCCLANE: Actually, I was always partial to Roy Rogers. I really dug those sequined shirts.
HANS: Do you really think you have a chance against us, Mr. Cowboy?
