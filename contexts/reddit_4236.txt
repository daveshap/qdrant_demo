I’m a 6’5 male and I struggle with my dating life...I hate when all of you guys think it’s just about height
I’m tall and I’m also a little bit chubby so I’m not exactly in the best shape of my life but I hate this idea I always hear about being tall is the gateway to guaranteed success in romance. I have to work just as much as everyone else, and I’m dieting my ass off to lose the weight that is making me insecure. I have my own hoops I had to jump and I still need to put in a lot work in myself to be fully 100% comfortable in my own skin. The reality is, for men especially, being comfortable in your own skin is the most attractive thing, not just to women, but people from all walks of life. Everyone wants to be around someone with positive energy. I know it because I use to be thinner at one point. People get so wrapped up about their problems that they join a subreddit online with other men because they refuse to do the one thing that matters: work on themselves. I promise you I’ve struggled just as much if not more than other guys with dating
