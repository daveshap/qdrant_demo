Teen advice please
So... I’m 15 and a guy, and I’m just gonna list a couple “situations” I got and if anyone could help that’d be awesome. 

Okay so one - I am like afraid to masturbate, idk why but I just feel guilty, I watch porn but always stop before I nut. Anyway I could overcome this?

Two, I don’t mean to sound like a dick, but people say I’m pretty good looking and some of the girls I talk to are pretty cute and I would like to date one. My only problem is I feel like it would be really awkward to date around my parents, is that weird or what... 

well that’s all I got for now, pls help :p
