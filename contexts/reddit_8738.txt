What are some good resources I can use to educate myself about the causes and effects of various proposed political policies in the US?
I feel like it's really easy to have political opinions. One might say "I want to pay less taxes" while another might say "I want the government to pay for everyone to have healthcare" and each would have their own reasons for holding those preferences. What I want to know is how can I educate myself on how all these different things would effect "the big picture" were they to happen? If we vote for lower taxes, how would that effect the way the government operates as we know it, what would we be giving up, etc? On the flip side, if we vote for socialized healthcare, how would that effect the economy with hundreds of insurance companies being forced out of business, millions of their employees becoming unemployed, etc. This may also have an effect on the salaries earned by healthcare providers, etc. I mean, it's one thing to say you want universal healthcare implemented in America. It's another thing to understand all of the causes and effects that would come about as a result.

When I vote, I want to be as informed as possible. I want to vote not just for what I *think* I want to happen, but policies that will actually have a positive effect on this country, our economy, and our overall well-being.

NOTE: the questions I outlined in my post are just examples and not things I am actually expecting you all to answer directly (although feel free to give it a try). What I am looking for is resources on how to best educate myself on all of the different policies, issues, etc that we vote on and how that will effect the big picture of life here in the US if certain policies were either implemented or eliminated. I hope that makes sense, let me know if you need me to further clarify.
