JOEL: Hi, it's Joel.
CLEMENTINE'S VOICE: Hey, lover. Whatcha doing?
JOEL: I'm just, y'know, passing the time best I can till I can see you.
CLEMENTINE'S VOICE: God, I can't believe I ever hated you.
JOEL: You must have been crazy.
CLEMENTINE'S VOICE: Guess what I'm wearing.
JOEL: I don't know. Panties and --
CLEMENTINE'S VOICE: Your dried cum.
JOEL: Jesus.
CLEMENTINE: You're still excited by my irreverence. You haven't yet started to think of it as my gratuitous need to shock.""
JOEL: I can't stop thinking about you.
CLEMENTINE: Yay. Meet me after work by the old mill.
JOEL: What old mill? Is that somewhere we --
CLEMENTINE: I just wanted to say that. Come by my house.
MARY: Oh.
STAN: Hi.
MARY: What do you want, Stan?
STAN: Can I... I brought some --
STAN: What's this?
MARY: Nothing.
STAN: I know what it is.
MARY: Then why did you ask me?
STAN: I don't know. I just -- there are a lot of really confused people showing up at the office.
MARY: They have a right to know. Howard is a thief. He steals the truth. I can't remember my baby! I can't remember my baby. It existed and I can't even remember. Do you understand that?
STAN: Mary, people come to him voluntarily.
MARY: I won't allow it. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. What do you think of that? That's from my quote book.
STAN: The office is filled with people who want their memories re-erased.
MARY: Remember the Alamo! Remember the Alamo!
STAN: Mary... please. This is hurting people.
