If you fell into a black whole with an accretion disc, but perpendicular If you fell into a black whole with an accretion disc, but orthogonal to the plane of the disc - would you ever meet the disc?I'm not asking whether you survive long enough, and obviously we assume that the disc has some non-zero width to avoid boring mathematical artifacts.My intuition would say that it would look as if the disc would come towards me from all sides (spaghettification), but I'd like that confirmed or corrected by people who know about this properly.As an add-on it would also be interesting to indeed deliberate if the cause of death would be due to heat first or that the curvature tears you to a line.
