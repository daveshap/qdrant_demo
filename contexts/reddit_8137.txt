Robert Mueller has been appointed a special counsel for the Russia probe. What is that and how does it work?
Today it was announced that [former FBI director Robert Mueller was appointed special counsel related to the inquiry into any coordination between the Russian government and the Trump campaign.](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/appointment-special-counsel)


 The [New York Times is reporting that this "dramatically raises the stakes for President Trump"](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/17/us/politics/robert-mueller-special-counsel-russia-investigation.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=span-ab-top-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news) in that inquiry.

The announcement comes quick on the heels of the [firing of FBI director Comey](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/09/us/politics/james-comey-fired-fbi.html) and the revelation that [Comey had produced a memorandum detailing his assertion that Trump had asked him to stop the investigation into Michael Flynn.](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/16/us/politics/james-comey-trump-flynn-russia-investigation.html)

So my questions are:

* What exactly are the powers of a special counsel?

* Who, if anyone, has the authority to control or end an investigation by a special counsel or remove the special counsel?

* What do we know about Mueller's conduct in previous high-profile cases?

* What can we learn about this from prior investigations conducted by special counsels or similarly positioned investigators?

**Helpful resources:**
