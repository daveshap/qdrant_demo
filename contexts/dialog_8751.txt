STARCK: You've got to listen...
MILLER: To what? What are you saying? This ship is alive?
STARCK: I didn't say that, I said the bio- readings correspond to what happened to you, the ship is reacting to us...
MILLER: We're hanging on by our fingernails and you're giving me bullshit stories...
STARCK: It's not bullshit, it's the only conclusion the data supports...
MILLER: Starck, do you know how crazy that sounds? It's impossible.
STARCK: I know that.
MILLER: If you knew it was impossible, then why'd you waste my time?
STARCK: I thought you wanted an answer. And that's the only one I have.
MILLER: What I want is to survive the next ten hours.
STARCK: Nine hours and twenty-two minutes.
MILLER: I'm going outside to work on the Clark. And Starck... don't tell anyone what you just told me. We've got enough to worry about.
