Where should one (23 f) go to meet someone who is not a fuckboy
23 (f) who cannot find  boyfriend material. Before you say go anywhere, I do go out quite a bit. I hike, dance, gym, go clubbing, etc. Every single man that I do date/meet does not want anything serious and will say that eventually. What am I doing wrong and where do all the great guys hang out? I feel like all of the great guys I meet are taken or “fuck boys”.
