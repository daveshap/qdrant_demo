MITCH: They're gone. The same pattern.
LYDIA: But they'll be back.
MITCH: We won't be here.
LYDIA: Where can we go, Mitch? There's no place to go.
MITCH: I want to try for San Francisco. There are buildings there. Steel and concrete!
LYDIA: We'd never make it. They're probably all over the road.
MITCH: We have to try it. We can't stay here. Melanie needs help. Mother, the house won't take another attack.
LYDIA: If... If... when we get to San Francisco... If they're already there?
MITCH: They won't be.
LYDIA: If they are?
MITCH: We'll worry about that when we get there.
LYDIA: I'm frightened, terribly frightened. I... I don't know what's out there, Mitch.
MITCH: What do we have to know, Mother? We're all together, we all love each other, we all need each other. What else is there? Mother, I want us to stay alive!
LYDIA: I started to say... inside...
MITCH: You don't have to.
