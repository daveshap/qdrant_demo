MADELEINE: I don't know.
SCOTTIE: Shopping?
MADELEINE: No.
SCOTTIE: Well... anywhere in particular?
MADELEINE: No, I Just thought I'd wander.
SCOTTIE: Ah. That's what I was going to do.
MADELEINE: Oh, yes, I forgot: It's your occupation, isn't it?
SCOTTIE: Don't you think it's sort of a waste for the two of us to...
MADELEINE: Wander separately? Ah, but only one is a wanderer. Two, together, are always going somewhere.
SCOTTIE: No... no, I don't think that's necessarily true.
