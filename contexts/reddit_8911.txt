Nancy Pelosi was recently re-elected to Speaker of the House. When she previously held the office from 2007-2011, what were her accomplishments and failures? Did she keep the Democratic Party together?
Congresswoman [Nancy Pelosi was re-elected](https://www.apnews.com/14bc4bc1d7bb4e87a76e42c9c73770dd) Speaker of the House on January 3rd, 2019. She previously held the office from 2007 to 2011.

Notably, during Pelosi's previous time as Speaker she signed the somewhat bipartisan 2008 financial crisis [bailout package](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/04/business/economy/04bailout.html), and played a significant role in the highly partisan [Affordable Healthcare Act](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/3/18/14957708/pelosi-pass-the-bill).

I have a couple of questions:

1: During Nancy Pelosi's 2007-2001 tenure as Speaker, what were her accomplishments and failures?

2: Did she keep the Democratic Party together?
