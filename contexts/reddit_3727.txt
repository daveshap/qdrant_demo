I DID IT!!!!
I DID IT!!! 


I finally asked out the girl that I’ve been crushin’ on. 

Unfortunately she did say no, but I’m still glad I asked because now I know for sure what her answer is.

In a way it’s kind of a relief or a feeling of closure. Now I can focus on other things, and if another lady grabs my attention, I’ll go from there.

I know objectively this isn’t all that exciting but I’m glad I actually took a risk.
