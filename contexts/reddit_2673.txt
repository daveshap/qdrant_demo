What's the best way to say: "I can't start working here until I put in my two week notice at my current job"?
I don't know why I'm struggling with how to "professionally" word this in an email. But basically, I have a part time job right now, and have been seeking full time employment elsewhere while I've been working here.

I applied at this small startup company, and received an email basically right after my first interview with them (the same day) saying they'd love for me to join the team and they want to fit me into a training week next week. They are aware I have a part time job right now and that I have been planning to quit as soon as I found a full time opportunity. I just don't want to be a jerk and not give my current job the 2-week notice that is common courtesy, especially because I know the department I was hired for is understaffed already.

But I also don't want to miss my opportunity with this startup company because quite frankly it pays a lot more, it's fully remote, and I can more or less make my own hours with the option to work OT if I want.

So how can I say this while expressing my interest in the offer?
