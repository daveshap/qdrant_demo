Do creepy men ruin it for all the good guys trying to date women?
 Women deal with creeps all the time. I can't blame them if they're hesitant of most guys but there are good ones out there. I feel since women get a lot of bad dudes hitting on them they have their guard up more and it just makes it harder for genuinely good men to date them.
