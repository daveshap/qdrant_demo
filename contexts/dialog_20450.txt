JUNIOR: Fuck.
BURNHAM: I know.
RAOUL: What?
BURNHAM: A woman and a little girl, both asleep upstairs.
JUNIOR: Fuck!
BURNHAM: Keep your voice down.
JUNIOR: They're not supposed to be here!
BURNHAM: This was your department, Junior.
JUNIOR: They're not supposed to be here!
BURNHAM: That's why the key didn't work, they changed the locks.
JUNIOR: Fourteen day escrow, man, that's almost three weeks! They shouldn't be here for another week! They don't own this house yet!
BURNHAM: Exactly how is fourteen days almost three weeks?
JUNIOR: Fourteen business days. Escrow is always business days.
JUNIOR: I mean, right? Isn't it?
BURNHAM: You're an idiot.
RAOUL: Watch your mouth.
JUNIOR: It's okay, Raoul.
BURNHAM: Who is this guy?
JUNIOR: Raoul is cool. That's all you need to know.
BURNHAM: This is insane. I'm outta here.
JUNIOR: Wait a minute, wait a minute. We can still handle this. Can we still handle this?
RAOUL: It's just the woman and the kid?
BURNHAM: Unless Daddy comes back later.
JUNIOR: Daddy's not coming back, she's in the middle of a divorce, it's just the two of them. We're okay, here. We can do this, right?
RAOUL: You're fuckin' A we can do this.
BURNHAM: Not with me. Not with people.
JUNIOR: Forty-five minutes. That's all you said you need. That's like nothing.
BURNHAM: She'll call the cops, they'll be here before I get unpacked.
JUNIOR: So we keep an eye on her. Raoul can totally administrate that part.
RAOUL: No problem.
BURNHAM: I don't want Raoul to administrate that part.
JUNIOR: They won't get hurt.
BURNHAM: What about us? What if she has a gun?
JUNIOR: Raoul, what in God's name do we do if she has a gun?
BURNHAM: Asshole.
JUNIOR: A guy shows you a gun, Burnham, and you insult him? Hey, who's the idiot? Huh?
BURNHAM: Where did you get this clown?
JUNIOR: I met him at the tables, same as you. And frankly, I'm grateful we have a little muscle right about now.
BURNHAM: What tables? I've never seen him before.
JUNIOR: Different tables.
BURNHAM: The fuck did you bring a gun for?
RAOUL: You're welcome.
BURNHAM: Peace out.
