CHARLIE: How was dinner?
KNOX: Terrible. Awful! I met the most beautiful girl I've ever seen in my life!
NEIL: Are you crazy? What's wrong with that?
KNOX: She's practically engaged to Chet Danburry. Mr. Mondo Jocko himself.
PITTS: Too bad.
KNOX: It's not too bad. It's a tragedy! Why does she have to be in love with a jerk?!
PITTS: All the good ones go for jerks, you know that. Forget her. Take out your trig book and figure out problem twelve.
KNOX: I can't just forget her, Pitts. And I certainly can't think about math!
