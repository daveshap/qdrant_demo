Lowering resource usage on Kodi-dedicated system I have a system set up dedicated to media streaming (Kodi/HTPC), running Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial). I'd like to limit resource usage (CPU/RAM) to the bare minimum for everything that isn't necessary to Kodi's operation. I can do without most of what Compiz/Unity offers, but removing them completely will most likely have an affect on  Kodi as well.What can I change/remove to minimize CPU and memory usage, without affecting Kodi? Switching to a different desktop environment/window manager is definitely a viable option, I'd just appreciate a few pointers on where to start. I'd like to avoid making a switch to a different distro, if possible.
