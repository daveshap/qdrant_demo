Introvert transitioning out of marketing. Can you help me find a path?
28-y.o. Canadian with a BA in Communications and 5 years of digital marketing experience under my belt. I'm ready for a change. Churning out creative content leaves me mentally exhausted, and, as an introvert, I've always struggled with the soft skills. While my work is pretty good, I'm a lot slower than my coworkers.

I'm looking for an alternative career with decent prospects that doesn't require another 4-year degree. I'm drawn to jobs like librarian, researcher, technical writer, conservator, archivist, or prosthetic/lab tech. Do you have any suggestions for me? Thanks in advance.

**I like...**

* Research
* Independent work
* Writing reports, formal documents
* Organizing, planning, strategizing
* A slow pace and perfectionism (I'd rather do one big project well than speed through a dozen small ones)
* Working with my hands
* Living in a big city (I hear library jobs are tough to find unless you're willing to move)

**I don't like...**

* Lots of interpersonal interaction
* More than 75% of my day spent on the computer (I'm flexible on this, but things like programming and graphic design aren't for me)
* Writing creative content
* Travel
* Long hours
* Math, other than marketing analytics

**My top skills:**

* Qualitative research
* Analysis and overthinking stuff  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
* Writing
* Visual art and graphic design
* Attention to detail and organizational skills
