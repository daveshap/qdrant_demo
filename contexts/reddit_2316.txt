I hate it when people assume I DONT do things for college
Like hell yeah I’m in all of these EC’s for college. Hell yeah I’m taking these stupid AP classes and getting A’s in them for college. And hell yeah I studied hard for the SAT and am working on my essays for college. Everything I do is for college and people need to stop assuming that I’m doing this for fun.
