ARGON: It works, Poppy. It works, it works!
POPPY: Now, Icky, I don't need you winding yourself up. I need you focused and in control.
ARGON: But, Poppy, you don't know what this means --
POPPY: You don't either. We won't know anything until we find that guy and find out if he's alive or what.
ARGON: Yes, that's true. We have to find him, run tests, determine if the polymerization is stable.
POPPY: In the meantime, we're going to need someone to deal with that mess in the lab. I don't think we should call Dr. Bright.
ARGON: Oh no. No. We'll get her assistant. What's-his-name? Nebbishman?
POPPY: Nebbleman.
