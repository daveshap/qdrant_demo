LAURA: Hello.
ROB: Hey, how ya doin'?
ROB: Guess who I just saw, right by my store? Ian. In Starbuck's. Neat, huh?
LAURA: I can't talk right now.
ROB: God, that's a cold and a half. Maybe you should bet back in bed.
ROB: Are you alright?
LAURA: Pigsty.
ROB: Don't worry about it. Just get into bed. Worry about that when you're better.
LAURA: Pig died.
ROB: Who the fuck's Pig?
LAURA: My dad died. My dad, my dad.
BARRY: What's up?
ROB: Laura. Her dad died.
BARRY: Ooh. Drag.
DICK: I'm sorry, Rob, that's, it's --
ROB: You're a horrible person, Barry. I mean it.
