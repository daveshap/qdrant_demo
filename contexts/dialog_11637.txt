MARTIN: Throw that away.
MARCELLA: This?
MARTIN: Don't tease me. You know what I do for a living.
MARCELLA: It's from one of those P.O. Boxes. How was the trip?
MARTIN: Tedious. I now authorize you to throw away all personal mail.
MARCELLA: All of it?
MARTIN: And not show it to me. Ever again.
MARCELLA: That's going to cost.
MARTIN: I'll pay.
MARCELLA: They're not happy, sir.
MARTIN: I'm not happy.
MARCELLA: They say their friend was suppose to have a heart attack and die in his sleep.
MARTIN: He didn't.
MARCELLA: They blame you for the compromise.
MARTIN: And they want me to make up for it.
MARCELLA: In Detroit. This weekend.
MARTIN: Tell them that's impossible. I need my normal lead time.
MARCELLA: They were very upset.
MARTIN: Would you describe their position as inflexible?
MARCELLA: Intractable, sir. You leave tonight.
MARCELLA: And sir, I also get that broken- mirror, black-cat, Friday-the- thirteenth kind of feeling about this one....
MARTIN: There's nothing to be done about it.
MARCELLA: I liquidated the last account in Zurich, and split it into two new ones in Estonia.
MARTIN: Good. What else? Anything interesting?
MARCELLA: Mmm, not really. But you're gonna love this one.
MARCELLA: Enough?
MARTIN: Never enough.
MARCELLA: But it's a Greenpeace boat. It'd be so easy.
MARTIN: I have scruples. Next.
MARCELLA: Paperwork on the Detroit thing. It's a full dossier. Very comprehensive.
