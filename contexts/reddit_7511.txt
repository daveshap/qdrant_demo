What has been your experience getting a Master’s degree funded, especially if the Master’s degree is required? What list is out there for list external funding programs for East Asian Studies?
Applying to Master’s programs in two years and was told the programs are not normally funded. But to look for external funding. Researched a bit on what was out there and wanted to see what the results looked like for anyone else.
