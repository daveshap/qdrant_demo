VAL: Did it yesterday. Franks and beans.

VAL: If there was one nearby I'd probably ask him.
EARL: I keep thinking, if we were but half serious about money, we should quit being hired hands and...
VAL: Handymen, Earl. We're handymen.
EARL: Whatever the hell we are, we should quit and go get ourselves some real employment.
