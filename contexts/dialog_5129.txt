PROFESSOR CARTER: Whoa! Didn't mean to scare you, Evan. Just wanted to know how the flatworms project was coming.
EVAN: Oh, fine I guess. It's been kind of crazy lately with my mom coming up, so I haven't...
PROFESSOR CARTER: I know, I know. Who can think of worms when your libido's in full swing, right?
PROFESSOR CARTER: Just don't drop the ball, okay?
EVAN: I won't let you down, Professor Carter.
EVAN: Please, mom. People will talk.
ANDREA: I can't help it. I'm just so proud of you. You've got the highest grades in all of your classes.
EVAN: Did Da -- Jason --- get good grades?
ANDREA: Please. He got straight A's without ever touching a book. That was the one area where his memory never failed him.
EVAN: Ma? Did he ever say that he figured out a way to recall a lost memory years after he blacked it out for the first time?
ANDREA: Why do you ask?
EVAN: No, it's just weird with him being such a brain and all, I just wondered if he was ever able to remember stuff he'd forgotten.
ANDREA: When he was around your age... almost exactly your age. He said he figured out a trick to remember the past.
ANDREA: I couldn't tell if they were real memories or just phantoms. You know, he might only have thought he actually remembered them...
EVAN: Sure...
ANDREA: And then, just before it got so bad that he had to be committed, he said that he could...
EVAN: What? What could he do?
