PETER: Being a cop has such a warm effect on people.
FRIDA: That's my ex. He's an asshole. In case you couldn't tell. I think he's been following me.
PETER: There's a lot of that going around.
PETER: You wanna get some coffee?
FRIDA: I'm trying to stay away from caffeine.
PETER: Some decaf then? That was stupid. Obviously you said you were staying away from caffeine as a nice way of blowing me off.
FRIDA: No. Really. I don't drink coffee anymore. I used to love it but my tastes have changed recently.
PETER: Okay well. Maybe some other time. They continue walking together.
PETER: So what book did you buy?
FRIDA: Oh, it's nothing.
PETER: No really, I love knowing what people read.
FRIDA: It's stupid.
PETER: I can forgive you a bestseller.
PETER: My mom used to get PMS too.
FRIDA: Used to? Did it stop finally?
PETER: No, she died when I was twelve.
FRIDA: I'm sorry.
PETER: I've had time to get over it. She was killed by wolves they think.
FRIDA: Oh my god, by wolves?
PETER: We lived in northern Minnesota. She went for a walk one night and they never found her body -- just her torn apart clothes with her blood and wolf blood on them. Then the town rounded up bunch of hunters and shot all the wolves in the area.
FRIDA: I'm so sorry Peter. Gee, that sure puts my problems in perspective.
PETER: The weird thing is I've had an odd, morbid fascination with wolves ever since.
FRIDA: I've read scripts about detectives, but never met one. Must be wild.
PETER: Sometimes it's frustrating. Like this Gregory Jameson case. We don't even know what killed him. I'm putting together little details to see if we're missing something.
FRIDA: Like what?
PETER: You know how moms always tell you to wear clean underwear in case you're in an accident? Well this guy wasn't wearing any underwear.
FRIDA: A lot of people don't wear underwear.
PETER: Yeah but a guy hung like a horse would need briefs to keep things in line.
