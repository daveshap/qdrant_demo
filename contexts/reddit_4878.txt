This is me finally talking about “it”.
I do not have depression, my husband does. He has depression, but we don’t use that word. We say “dark days” and on those days his mood is self-described as “blah”. He has depression, but we don’t talk about it.       
It’s not for lack of trying on my part. I wish he could open up and tell me how he’s feeling. I wish he could cry with me and tell me that we’ll get through this as much as I tell him. My husband has depression, but we don’t tell anyone about it. “Where’s your husband?” Is the hardest question to hear sometimes. “Why didn’t your husband come?” “He isn’t feeling well”, I say. “We decided he needed to get some rest.” We don’t talk about it. It is dark. It is a cloud that hangs over our house for weeks. Sometimes, it  isn’t so bad. We have good days. We even have great months. Beautiful months. But it rears it’s ugly head and we know. We know because the house feels tight. The rooms when we’re together feel as though they are squeezing in. It doesn’t care that I need to be touched, or that I need to touch my husband. We don’t talk about it. But we do fight through. We stand back to back. Sometimes, I have to support both of us with my broken emotions and iron love, and that’s okay. I know he realizes all of this, I know because in those good days and great months, I’m treated as a queen. We make love and make memories and we shine. We shine so bright that I know when the dark days come, we’ll fight them. He knows he has me somewhere in those dark, cold days, even if he can’t see or hear me, he knows I’m there. And I know that he’s there, too, still the man I love, the hero of my fairytale. 
The hardest part though, the part that I wish we could change (because depression isn’t something that can just be fixed, I know this); my husband has depression, but we don’t talk about it.
