Looking for some tips to making some extra money quick to buy my daughter a Halloween costume
Hi I recently lost my job and in the process of losing my apartment but I still want to get my daughter a costume I found one she’s love on target for 25 $ a unicorn costume . I don’t have anyone I could borrow money from . Looking for some good ideas or tips to making some cash in the next few days if possible ? She’s only five and doesn’t know I lost my job yet everyday when I bring her to school I feel awful when she wishes me a good day at work . I’ve been looking for a job everywhere in the next 15miles radius from me and still nothing . I’ve been to over 20 interviews and nothing . I’ve had a rough few months and starting to lose hope . I just want her to be happy, I think she’d be so disappointed if I didn’t find a way to get her something
