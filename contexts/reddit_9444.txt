Paid off 99% of my credit card debt!
I have been a longtime lurker on here.. Soaking in all the tips and tricks I could and finally feel accomplished enough to post. 

I sold my condo this week and made a little money off of it- $24K. The second the wire hit my account I paid off all of my credit card debt except $2k which will be paid off in 2 weeks.

I feel 10 pounds lighter and am so hopeful for my financial future. 

Thank you to this community for being so positive and inspirational.
