Laid off after four months
I got laid off today due to my position being eliminated post an acquisition.   It was a high level management position.   Should I update my resume to include this?  Will it be a red flag?   What should my next few steps be?  I already reached out to recruiters I know.   How do I get over this embarrassment?   Thanks.
