JUDD: This is curious, Jason. Half the time you talk as if Shakespeare were not fit to tie your shoe—laces; now this sudden humility.
JASON: I should like people to read what I've written.
JUDD: And this poetry —— like the poetry you wrote before extols the passion and beauty of life?
JASON: It goes beyond that. It praises the goodness of God and the greatness of all His works.
JUDD: I hope it finds as much favor as your other book -- but somehow I doubt it -- the time is out of tune.
JASON: Why not let your publisher judge that?
JASON: Wait —- there is that other favor.
JUDD: I'd forgotten.
JASON: Tell me where Jacqueline is -— we've got to find her.
JUDD: You don't expect me to do that do you?
JASON: Yes. When I tell you.
JUDD: Tell me what?
JASON: You'll have good enough sense to tell us where she is -— when you know she's a murderess. She killed a man.
JUDD: Tell me, why this sudden desire to publish — to awaken like Byron and find yourself famous.
JASON: I think it's time.
JUDD: No other reason —— no woman ——not the little Miss Gibson?
JASON: Perhaps.
JUDD: I'll do all I can to help. I'll go to my publisher tomorrow.
