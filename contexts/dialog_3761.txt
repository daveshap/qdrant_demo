RACHAEL: Who is this?
DECKARD: Me and my dad.
RACHAEL: Where is he?
DECKARD: Dead.
RACHAEL: Oh.
RACHAEL: How come you're not on the job?
DECKARD: I am. Part of my job is to sit on a couch and try and figure things out.
RACHAEL: How are you doing?
DECKARD: Not too good.
RACHAEL: What do people do in the afternoon?
DECKARD: If they are smart, they take naps.
RACHAEL: Do you dream?
DECKARD: Yeah. Sometimes.
RACHAEL: I wish I could.
