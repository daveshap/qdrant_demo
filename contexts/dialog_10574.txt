HAROLD: Collar bone is broken. No infection yet... the bandages should be changed twice a day.
RUDY: I got a nurse in mind.
HAROLD: The glucose will begin working in half an hour. You'll feel better then...
RUDY: The three of us are going to do some traveling. We're going to take your car to El Paso.

RUDY: Is it possible, Mrs. Clinton?
FRAN: Just... tell us what you want.
RUDY: What kind of car do you have, Harold?
FRAN: A Ford... We have a Ford.
RUDY: That's good. That's very good. Now Harold, you go out and gas up the Ford, check the oil and tires, we don't want any problems on the road. One more thing... If anybody but you comes back...
