MARGO: Murphy kid turn you down?
PLAGUE: I disguised myself as an Alabama State Trooper and penetrated the FBI NCIC.
MARGO: Pervert! What are you talking about?
PLAGUE: The FBI computer holds files on twenty million Americans. I just hacked into it.
MARGO: Congratulations.
PLAGUE: From here I got access to every piece of data ever stored on Dade Murphy's parents. His parents separated five years ago, reconciled two years later, filed for divorce last year, custody battle, boy chose to go with his mother. Hmm.
MARGO: So?
PLAGUE: So, we get the mother, we get the boy.
KATE: What the hell are you doing?
DADE: It's cool, I'm just looking.
KATE: It's too much machine for you.
DADE: Yeah?
