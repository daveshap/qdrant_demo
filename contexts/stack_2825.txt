DC kilo ampere current carrying wire Can anyone please let me know how to generate kilo ampere current in a given circuit? I am thinking of the possibility of creating a magnetic field in a large solenoid, say of radius 5 m &amp; length 15 m. There cannot be iron core inside the solenoid  to enhance the field. So, to generate 1-2 tesla field, I will need quite large current and the wire should have many turns. It looks like the standard 1 mm wire can carry only 10 A which is not sufficient. But is it impossible to generate kilo ampere level current in non- superconducting wires? If so, what will be the dimensions of the wire? Is there any example to learn from? Any help is appreciated.Regards,Kolahal
