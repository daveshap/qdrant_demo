PATTERSON: The females are bigger- only animal here like that- have to be or they wouldn't survive because the males eat the young.
STARLING: Anything special about them?
PATTERSON: Just that they fart through their mouths. Must make kissing something of a gamble.
STARLING: I've lived in Africa a year and I don't know what you know. How long have you been here?
PATTERSON: Almost three hours. But I've been getting ready all my life.
STARLING: Every time I see something like that, I know we're right to be here- to bring Christianity into their lives, enrich their souls.
PATTERSON: Beaumont says it's to end slavery.
STARLING: We all have our reasons. Mine is simply to make them understand happiness, accept salvation, know the serenity that comes- -best I stop. One of the by-products of my belief is that I can become amazingly boring. But I know God smiles on me.
PATTERSON: Have you got that in writing?
STARLING: Samuel is camp liaison- absolutely indispensable- the only man here everyone trusts.
PATTERSON: Does he speak English?
