BABE: No. Are you?
LONGFELLOW'S VOICE: No.
BABE: You don't go out with girls very much, do you?
LONGFELLOW'S VOICE: I haven't.
BABE: Why not?
LONGFELLOW: Oh, I don't know.
BABE: You must have met a lot of swell society girls since you've been here. Don't you like them?
LONGFELLOW: I haven't met anybody here that I like, particularly. They all seem to have the St. Vitus Dance.[12] Except you, of course. People here are funny. They work so hard at living - they forget how to live Last night, after I left you, I was walking along and looking at the tall buildings and I got to thinking about what Thoreau said. They created a lot of grand palaces here - but they forgot to create the noblemen to put in them.
LONGFELLOW: I'd rather have Mandrake Falls.
BABE: I'm from a small town too, you know.
LONGFELLOW: Really?
BABE: Probably as small as Mandrake Falls.
LONGFELLOW: Gosh! What do you know about that!
