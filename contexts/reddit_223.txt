I don't know what to do now
So I have a family of 5, my parents and my three sisters. I'm the youngest one out of the three. My mom just came downstairs to have a "chat" about the relationship between my sisters and I. My sisters both go the university while I'm still stuck in high-school. I usually can not get a conversation going with my mom because she thinks I have a bad attitude and don't try to make friends. I get really pissed off everytime my mom tells to change and make some friends at school. It's not like I don't try to make friends, but the girls in my grade are very materialistic and really enjoy gossiping. I'm not that type of person to go around and start spreading rumours. Therefore, I'm only acquaintances with the girls. I'm more better off talking to boys cause they're chill and fine with the jokes I make. After all, the guys don't take the things I say to heart. On the other hand, my mom doesn't like the idea of me having friends that are boys because they are guys. I have a cousin and that's like the closest friend I've got. However, I don't tell him my secrets because it's highly likely that he'll tell my sisters. My sisters are always busy cause they're in university. Sometimes they're not as busy, so we try to sit down and try to talk. Once I start talking another talks over me and completely ignores me. My mom always tells me to be nice and listen to others, but they don't do the same and take advantage of it. What can I do, can anyone tell me?
