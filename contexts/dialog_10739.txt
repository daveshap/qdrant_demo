REBECCA: Now are you going to get a regular job?
ENID: Don't worry.
REBECCA: If it makes you feel any better, I don't think you could've gotten more than ten bucks for all this stuff.
ENID: Yeah, thanks.
REBECCA: Do you want to do something tonight?
ENID: I can't, it's Seymour's birthday... Shit! What time is it? I have to go to the store! I was going to make him a cake...
REBECCA: Well, are we still going shopping tomorrow?
ENID: Yeah, I guess... call me...
