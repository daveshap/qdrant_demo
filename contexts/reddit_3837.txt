To all us guys struggling.
You’ve heard every bit of advice about a profile, dress up, take better photos, be confident blah blah blah.

Objectively being more physical attractive on dating sites will get you more matches, it just will. I’m not a physically attractive dude, I am about average I don’t work out but I eat very well and firmly believe I’m repping team dad bod. I’ve been single for about six months and I’ve been dating seriously for maybe 4-5 weeks at this point. 

In that time what I’ve noticed is that every genetic piece of advice you get is both correct and incorrect. I am not physically fit or attractive I have a relatively attracted face but objectively my female friends have put me at like a 5/6 I’m as they’d put it “Fuckable but nothing on Ryan Reynolds.” 

I offset this with my personality, now the issue with online dating is how can you use a personality to hook someone in a few paragraphs/A photo.

What’s worked for me is embracing my flaws, I’ve got a picture on my profile of me imitating fat Thor. I’ve got one where I’m in a fucking dragon onesie screeching like a fool. They are fun photos and I’ve gotten more conversations out of those than any of my professional pictures, which I also have on because I’m dressed up and look nice. I tell people I’m a massive nerd in my bio and people ask about those hobbies. You don’t have to be Ryan Reynolds to get matches, but you do need to create a hook that makes someone WANT to talk to you.

I’m not saying it’s perfect or guaranteed, but I’ve gotten more success out of going all out and embracing my flaws and making jokes out of them than trying to hide them.

Hope this helps some of you out there 😀
