MARGOT: Why?!
SERENA: I mean, I know you're upset and all, but can't you just take a sedative?
ELLE: Once Warner sees me as a serious law student, he'll want me back. It's a completely brilliant plan!
MARGOT: But isn't it kind of hard to get into law school?
ELLE: I have the highest GPA in Delta Gamma!
MARGOT: Here. You're gonna need this.
ELLE: Your scrunchie?
MARGOT: My lucky scrunchie. It helped me pass Spanish.
SERENA: You passed Spanish because you gave Professor Montoya a hand-job after the final.
MARGOT: Yeah, luckily.
