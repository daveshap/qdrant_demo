Does the British exit from the European Union represent a constitutional crisis?
The British constitution is not a constitution in the normal sense; it's not codified into one document like those of most modern states, which makes the United Kingdom a very flexible entity.  It's best described as an amalgamation of social consensus, political conventions, precedent and statutes going back to the Magna Charta of 1215.^[1](https://www.bl.uk/magna-carta/articles/magna-carta-an-introduction)  "Brexit" is challenging many of the long-held conventions and norms that sustain the British state; among them are^[2](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/18/brexit-is-destroying-britains-constitution/):

(1) Parliamentary sovereignty is the notion that Parliament (the House of Commons, the House of Lords and the Monarch through his or her representative in Parliament) has  "...the right to make or unmake any law whatever: and, further, that no person or body is recognized by the law of England as having a right to override or set aside the legislation of Parliament."^[3](https://legalresearch.blogs.bris.ac.uk/2017/12/the-models-of-parliamentary-sovereignty/)  Furthermore, "...It is often said that it would be unconstitutional for the United Kingdom Parliament to do certain things, meaning that the moral, political and other reasons against doing them are so strong that most people would regard it as highly improper if Parliament did these things. But that does not mean that it is beyond the power of Parliament to do such things. If Parliament chose to do any of them, the courts would not hold the Act of Parliament invalid."^[4](http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/format.cgi?doc=/uk/cases/UKPC/1968/1968_18.html)
