How much in fees aren’t covered by tuition waivers?
Have a full tuition waiver and a stipend, but still had to pay almost $1000 in tuition fees.. is this normal?

Asked a person with accounting at my school and they said yes but I’m not sure that they actually understood what I was asking. 3 semesters with fees like that takes away over 10% of the yearly income I get from the program so would like to know if this is normal or not.
