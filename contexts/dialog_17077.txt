GRADUATE STUDENT: Linda King's desk.
LECKTOR: Hi, Linda. ..
GRADUATE STUDENT: Linda doesn't come in nights.
LECKTOR: Maybe you can help me. This is Bob Greer of Blaine & Edwards Publishing Company. Dr. Bloom asked me to send a copy of 'The Psychiatrist and the Law' to someone. Linda never sent me the address and phone number.
GRADUATE STUDENT: She'll be in, in the morning...
LECKTOR: I have to catch Federal Express within about five minutes. I'd be immensely appreciative if you'd pull it out of her Rolodex for me.
GRADUATE STUDENT: She doesn't have a Rolodex.
LECKTOR: I'll bet she has a call caddy right next to her phone.
GRADUATE STUDENT: Yeah...
LECKTOR: Well, zip that little pointer right on down to the letter G.
GRADUATE STUDENT: Okay.
LECKTOR: We're looking for Graham. The man the book is supposed to go to is a Mr. Will Graham.
GRADUATE STUDENT: Federal Bureau of Investigation, Tenth and Pennsylvania, Washington, D.C.
LECKTOR: Now I'll bet it has his home address there, too
GRADUATE STUDENT: 3680 DeSoto Highway. Marathon, Florida.
LECKTOR: Thank you very much.
