LIEUTENANT: You amaze me, Commander.
UHURA: How is that...?
LIEUTENANT: A twenty year space veteran, yet you ask for the worst duty station in town. I mean, look at this place: the hind end of space.
UHURA: Peace and quiet appeals to me, Lieutenant.
LIEUTENANT: Well, maybe that's okay for someone like you whose career is winding down. But me: I need some challenge in my life. Some adventure... Even just a surprise or two.
UHURA: You know what they say, Lieutenant. Careful what you wish for: you may get it.
UHURA: Gentlemen. Good evening.
KIRK: Good evening, Commander. Everything ready?
UHURA: Yes, Admiral. Step into my parlor.
LIEUTENANT: Commander, these are some of the most famous people in Starfleet! Admiral Kirk, my God!
UHURA: Good for you, Lieutenant.
LIEUTENANT: But it's damn irregular. No destination orders, no encoded i.d...
UHURA: All true.
LIEUTENANT: Well -- what are we going to do about it?!
UHURA: I am going to do nothing about it. <u>You</u> are going to sit in the closet.
LIEUTENANT: The <u>closet</u>?! Have you lost all sense of reality?
UHURA: This isn't reality. This is fantasy.
