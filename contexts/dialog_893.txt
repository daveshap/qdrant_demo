SYKES: ... and so, and so the doctor says, If this is the thermometer
JETSON: In the other man's rectum.
SYKES: Sticking out of his ass... yeah! See, that's what makes it a joke. There's like a surprise, and your mind fills in the funny picture. Here's this guy with a pen stuck in his ass and he thinks it's a thermometer. Nada, huh?
SYKES: Your health...
JETSON: Ta ss'trakyona'...
JETSON: There is so much our two peoples don't understand about each other.
SYKES: No shit, Holmes. You're only from another goddamn planet, for chrissakes.
JETSON: You humans are very curious to us. You invite us to live among you, in an atmosphere of equality we've never known before. You lay before us a beautiful green world, full of freedoms and opportunities... You give us ownership of our lives for the first time... and you ask no more of us than you do of yourselves: to live by the rules... rules that aren't made to keep one people subordinate to another, but rules that exist to preserve equality. You aspire to very high ideals here.
JETSON: I hope you can understand how special your world is... how unique a people you humans are. So it us all the more painful and confusing to us that so few of you seem capable of living up the the ideals you set for yourselves.
SYKES: Don't count on me, George. I never had any ideals.
