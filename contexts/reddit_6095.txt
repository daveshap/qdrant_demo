Actively looking for a job during lockdown?
Hi all. I work in Mexico in the energy sector. 

I was inching closer to leaving my job before the whole COVID thing started (as in, when my country went into full lockdown I had a four week timeline to start looking for the next job). 

But then this whole thing exploded and I got trapped here, in a job that basically exhausted its possibilities and with bosses that don't take our health seriously. Even if a lot of us could work from home full time, they still make us go to the office one or two days a week. 

I'm personally not happy with that and I'd like to look for another job, but I'm not sure how good of an idea it would be. Here I have a lot of seniority and would be one of the last people they'd cut off, while in the next job I'd be the new guy and probably the least likely to be kept if they had to do a layoff. On the other hand, I'm a specialist in a very specialized field (energy sector), any company that hires me would probably do it knowing well what for they would hire me. 

On the other hand, we don't know where lockdown will finish and, particularly, how the job market will be when it ends. Somehow I get the feeling that waiting until then might be waiting too much because it may be much harder to find a job during recession.

What do you think? Should I endure it here and take a risk later? Or should I try to change horses in the middle of the race?
