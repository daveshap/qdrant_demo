I need some adivce
Sorry about the vague title.

Some context: I have been considering coming out to my parents for quite some time now. They aren't *against* the LGBTQ community, but it seems like they care a lot about "who's gay" and "who's straight" (referring to celebrities).

As some of you might know, WorldPride is happening in Toronto this week. I was invited to help build the float for my university, which will be marching in the parade. I messaged my mom about this, and she said she's fine with me building the float but she doesn't want me in the parade, which is this Sunday, because she is "still a little bit conservative". She said we would talk more about this tonight.

I was strongly considering coming out this weekend, but that comment just made me question everything. I have been hyperventilating and shaking for the past hour, I don't know what to do. Any advice would be great.
