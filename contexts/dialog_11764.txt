ANNIE: Why didn't it work out?
TOM: She was never really happy here. She did the best she could.
TOM: Grace told me you have a country house in Connecticut. Sounds like a beautiful place.
ANNIE: It is. It's lovely.
TOM: Ever think of moving there full time?
ANNIE: We did at one point. When we thought we'd have more children. And we after tried. We tried everything, but... wasn't meant to be.
TOM: I hear that! See, I knew she was never going to be a ranchest, but I wanted to try -- I thought maybe she'd give music lessons to the kids in town or at the school, maybe even recitals. My son would grow up here. Maybe have one or two more. I'd teach 'em what I could. They'd play with my brother's kids. All grow up together. And even if they all decided to go out into the world, they'd always know where home was -- cause we'd keep it for 'em...
ANNIE: That's very important to you, isn't it? Home.
TOM: Yeah, I think it is. And I don't mean everybody's got to be married, have kids -- It's more like, knowing where you're from, where you belong, what feeds you, where you can go no matter what happens... Knowing what you're supposed to be doing while you're here.
ANNIE: How did you find out all that?
