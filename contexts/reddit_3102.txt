I’m up for a promotion against 2 others. How do I set myself apart?
I work at a small local pizza/catering chain in the Cleveland area. Our GM (who is part owner with his parents) is looking for someone to replace himself so he can step up to the Owner position so his parents can retire. The position was offered to me and 2 ladies. They’re both in their 40’s and have worked there for 10+ years. I’m 24 and have worked there for 3 years. I also have a culinary degree. 

How do I set myself apart from them to show I’ll excel? I already am a shift manager and run the store solo all the time. Same with the 2 ladies. We are literally all comparable when it comes to skill sets and management quality. The one lady may have a slight up as she does our scheduling. 

Any tips reddit? I wanna show them I can make the place better than it already is.
