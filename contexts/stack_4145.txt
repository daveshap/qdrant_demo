Spouse visa for multiple entry to the US I am a US citizen living abroad. My wife is a Polish national living abroad. Our child is a dual national. Neither of us intend to live in the US anytime soon, but we would like to visit the US frequently.When I google \u201cUS spouse visa\u201d all hits concern acquiring a green card, which is just not relevant for us.What\u2019s the name of the visa we should apply for?
