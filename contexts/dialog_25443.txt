GEORDI: This used to be the throttle valve assembly. It controls the thrust of the engines. It's been completely vaporized... and without it, there's no way to launch the ship.
PICARD: Can you reconstruct the throttle valve?
GEORDI: Yeah... if I knew what it looked like. There's probably five hundred ways to design a valve like this...
PICARD: We need to launch this ship in under eighteen hours... There must be some design schematics... blueprints...
GEORDI: We're tearing this place apart looking for them... but the computers are down, and the fires destroyed half the files...so far, nothing.
