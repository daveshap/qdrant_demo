Relativistic speed Ion engine I'm a newbie so this might be obvious to others but....if the specific impulse of an ion engine is limited by it's fuel load then why not accelerate singular fuel (krypton) ions to relativistic speeds before exhausting them out of the engine. Does Newton's law apply? Does the increased mass of the ion give an equal and opposite reaction whilst still within the engines accelerator?
