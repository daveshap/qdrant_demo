SAM: Some, thanks. Enough to move on, for now.
JEAN-PIERRE: You should really let a doctor look at that.
SAM: Soon.
JEAN-PIERRE: But first you have something to take care of?
SAM: Yeah.
JEAN-PIERRE: Something important? A thing that cannot wait?
SAM: It gets done now or not at all. Another couple of days and the parties concerned are gone where I can't get them.
JEAN-PIERRE: Forgive my intrusion into your affairs, but I am the one who connected Vincent to this job, his agent, if you will. He is one of my oldest friends and I owe him a great debt, much like the debt I suspect he owes you.
