CATES: You took a big chance, leaving this here all this time.
HAMMOND: Not really. I figured Ganz was put down for a long time. And I knew Luther would never job me on his own. He's too chickenshit.
CATES: Guess what? Luther just got in line.
HAMMOND: What?
CATES: Musta got some primo bondsman.
HAMMOND: Jesus Christ. That's a disgrace The guy pulls a gun on a cop and he's out in 24 hours. I tell you some of the courts these days are just a fucking revolving door.
ATTENDANT: Yeah?
LUTHER: I want to pick up my car.
ATTENDANT: Name?
LUTHER: Hammond.
ATTENDANT: This is three years old.
LUTHER: Yeah, I've been busy.
ATTENDANT: We don't wash 'em, ya know.
LUTHER: How about chargin' the battery?
ATTENDANT: That we do. And we put air in the tires. I'll even sell you some gas if you need it.
LUTHER: Great, just great.
HAMMOND: Jesus Christ, look at all the dust on my car...why in the hell don't he take it to a car wash?
CATES: Didn't know you darker people went in for foreign jobs.
HAMMOND: I had no choice. Some white asshole bought the last piece of shit skyblue Cadillac.
CATES: You'd think the guy'd be smart enough to know he was being tailed.
HAMMOND: Tryin' to save his girl, man. He's in another world.
CATES: If I was his size and had Ganz on my ass, I'd just leave town.
HAMMOND: I'm tellin' you the man's in love... he wants to be a hero for his girl.
CATES: Oh, yeah, does bein' in love make you stupid?
CATES: I suppose you'd never be like Luther and let a woman get to you...
HAMMOND: I let women get to me. The quest for pussy is the meaning of life ... I got my own personal philosophy about 'em. Keep women separate from guns, money and business ... women are for spending money. They got nothing to do with helping you make it.
CATES: That ain't philosophy. That's common sense.
HAMMOND: Say, do you always work people over like you did Luther?
CATES: If they don't tell me what I need to know...
HAMMOND: Doesn't it get... Tiring?
CATES: I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it 'cause it works-...
HAMMOND: You got a very depressing view of life, man... you gotta smile once in awhile...
CATES: Maybe Luther hopes Ganz'll give him a piece of your money...
HAMMOND: If he's hoping that then he's dumber than I think he is, which would be amazin', cause I already think he's real dumb.
HAMMOND: A long time agb Luther must of got the shit beat out of him so bad it just rattled his brain ... that would account for him making so many wrong moves in a row...
CATES: Yeah, it doesn't look like he's gonna make it as a dangerous tough guy...
HAMMOND: You know, I'd be embarrassed if I let my wheels go the way you've done with this job.
CATES: What you don't understand is, I don't give a damn about how this thing looks.
HAMMOND: No class...
CATES: Class isn't somethin' you buy, punk. Look at you, five hundred dollar suit and you're still a lowlife.
HAMMOND: We're getting too close ... Cates, what's the matter, you been takin' dumb pills?
CATES: Yeah, most cops are pretty dumb... But since you're the one that landed in jail what's that make you?
