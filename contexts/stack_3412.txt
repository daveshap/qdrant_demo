Cartoon TV series about a boy and an alien (flying head) living in the boy's watches I watched these series as a kid on TV in Russia around 2000 year or even earlier.The two main characters are a boy, who has some watch-like wristband, and an alien, who is a freely levitating head and can shrink himself to fit into the boy's watches. The alien, for some reason, always had to return inside the watches and live there.Each episode, as I remember, was about this alien helping the boy to overcome some difficulties using alien technologies.One episode I remember was the other way around: the alien needed the boy's help, so he made the boy enter the watches, whose interior turns out to be a whole universe (though almost empty).The series themselves certainly weren't Russian, but I didn't know any foreign language at the time, so I can't say what was the original even if I could hear it beneath the translation.The animation looked 1980-style.A few years ago I managed to find on the Internet only a short video from the series, which I can't find anymore. Now all my searches only result in \"Ben 10\which is not what I'm looking for: the boy wasn't a shapeshifter.
