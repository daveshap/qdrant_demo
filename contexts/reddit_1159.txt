Does anyone else hate how easily other people can ruin your day?
 A phone call with an angry client, a threatening email from a third party, a slightly insensitive comment, people stopping their conversations when you walk past...

I'm fairly certain that my peers cope with these things just fine. But almost every time they happen to me my day is ruined and I have to constantly seek reassurance from people that everything is alright.

I wish I could learn to just let go of these things instead of them going around my head like a sock in a washing machine for the rest of the day...
