GRANT: Atomic fuel?
OWENS: Nothing you could see with the naked eye. But there's a microscopic radio-active particle inside.
GRANT: If it's no military secret, how can a sub run on a microscopic particle?
OWENS: They can't reduce nuclear fuel. But once the Reactor's Miniaturized -- along with the submarine -- a microscopic particle should emit enough energy to activate it.
GRANT: That's cutting it mighty close -- for a perfect fit.
OWENS: It should work -- theoretically. If it doesn't, the mission's off. The craft's nuclear-powered. Except for your wireless.
GRANT: All in all, quite a canoe...
OWENS: Designed for Piscatorial Research -- the Spawning Habits of Deep Sea Fish.
GRANT: Remind me to ask you about the love life of an octupus.
