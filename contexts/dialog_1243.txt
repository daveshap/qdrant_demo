DAVID: Why are you doing this to me, Jack?
BRINGSLY: This isn't Mr. Goodman's idea. He is your good friend, whereas I am a victim of your carnivorous lunar activities.
DAVID: Mr. Bringsly, I'm sorry. I have absolutely no idea what to say to you.
BRINGSLY: You've left my wife a widow and my children fatherless. And I understand that I am to walk the earth one of the living dead until the wolf's bloodline is severed and the curse lifted.
