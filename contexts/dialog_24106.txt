COLE: We were supposed to draw a picture. Anything we wanted... I drew a man. He got hurt in the neck by another man with a screwdriver.
MALCOLM: You saw that on T.V., Cole?
COLE: Everybody got upset. They had a meeting. Momma started crying. I don't draw like that anymore.
MALCOLM: How do you draw now?
COLE: I draw people with smiles, dogs running, and rainbows. They don't have meetings about rainbows.
MALCOLM: I guess they don't.
