What is the background check like on/after your first start date?
On the company's portal, I gave my information, the standard, address, work history, background etc. I was given an offer. I accepted the offer. And then a welcome email stating my first start date.


It seems like they did a background check of some sort. 


My questions:


It is possible for companies to either:


a) did not finish the background check (but want me to start)


b) will CONTINUE the background check even after I start?


Is this practice possible? 


For context: it's worrying because if I quit my current job, and go to new job and say something came up -- they can terminate me and I'm left without a job.


Just curious if anyone seen/heard or have experience with background check when employed?


Thanks
