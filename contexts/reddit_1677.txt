ED admits: Congrats, but withdraw your applications.
A few people from my competitive public school have been admitted ED to T20s. While the rest of us are excited for their success, we aren’t excited by the fact that they’re refusing to withdraw RD apps, just to see whether or not they’ll get in (even though they cannot attend). ‘Just for fun, out of curiosity’.

... yea, don’t do that. Don’t hurt the chances of people who are applying RD and want an equal shot at their dream school. You’ve accomplished YOUR dream, and for that we say congrats, but now let us accomplish ours.
