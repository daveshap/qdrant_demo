VINCENT: Quite an achievement...
IDA: What's your name?
VINCENT: Vincent...
MAX: I came to see you, you look fine. We gotta go.
IDA: Vincent. It was nice to meet you. Visit again?
VINCENT: I'm in town for a short time.
IDA: Try?
VINCENT: Of course!
VINCENT: You take one more step, I'll kill her.
MAX: You'd do her a favor.
