DANO: Calm down, Kimmy. It's not drugs, just weed.
FRANKIE: Yeah, you should have specified.
MR. BURROUGHS: Kimberly? It's Dad.
KIMBERLY: Hey, Dad. What's up?
MR. BURROUGHS: Your car's leaking either transmission or brake fluid. I want you to have it checked ASAP at a gas station.
KIMBERLY: You got it, Dad. I'll call you if I have a problem.
MR. BURROUGHS: I mean it. Take care of it.
KIMBERLY: I will, Dad. Bye, luv you.
