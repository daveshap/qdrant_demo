AUDREY: Mr. Caiman, you're married.
CAIMAN: And you're beautiful...
AUDREY: Mr. Caiman...
CAIMAN: Call me Charlie.
AUDREY: Mr. Caiman, I've been doing extra research for you after hours and weekends for nearly a year. And I've never asked for anything but this job is really important to me. I'm too old to be an assistant anymore. I need to know this job is going someplace.
CAIMAN: So have dinner with me tonight.
AUDREY: I can't.
CAIMAN: It's your choice.
ELSIE: Three years digging up worms in Chernobyl? How did Mrs. Tatopoulos handle it?
NICK: Oh, I'm not married.
ELSIE: Really? A girlfriend then?
NICK: No. Perhaps I work too much.
ELSIE: You mean to tell me that there is no one who holds a special place in your heart?
NICK: Not for a long time, now.
ELSIE: Well, I think you're cute.
NICK: Oh, thank you. Is she always like this?
