Analysing landuse data in a buffer layer In my project I want to analyse the landuse around some points within a certain radius. So I created a buffer around my points but I have no idea how QGIS could probably tell me what different landuses are laying inside of the buffers (like 2 km\u00b2 forest, 3 km\u00b2 residential etc.). I have already loaded a vector layer which shows the different landuses in the whole area in general on the map.
