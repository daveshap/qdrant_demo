MEREDITH: But you're going skiing with us Yankees, aren't you?
RIPLEY: What?
MEREDITH: At Christmas. To Cortina with Freddie Miles and --
RIPLEY: How did you know that?
MEREDITH: Everybody knows Freddie Miles.
RIPLEY: Is Freddie in Rome?
MEREDITH: Now? I don't think so. But I've met him, of course, and we've chatted and I know about you and Marge and Mongi and what an unreliable rat you are. Freddie said you were a rat and I thought to myself now I know why he travels under R.
RIPLEY: I've left Marge, Meredith. And Mongi. So the rat's here now, in Rome.
MEREDITH: Sorry, I wouldn't have made a joke if --
RIPLEY: Don't be sorry. I've never been happier. I feel like I've been handed a new life.
MEREDITH: The truth is if you've had money your entire life, even if you despise it, which we do -- agreed? -- you're only truly comfortable around other people who have it and despise it.
RIPLEY: I know.
MEREDITH: I've never admitted that to anyone.
