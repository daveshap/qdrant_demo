interpretation of double slit experiment If you do the double slit experiment with a laser beam, you get an interference pattern; as light goes through different paths and the phase shift leads to constructive and destructive interferences. This gives us an evidence of wavy behavior of light.Now, if you do the same experiment with one photon (or electron ,...) at a time, you get the same interference pattern, but this time the interference pattern gives you the probability of each photon ending up in a specific place on the backstop.My confusion is, that why don't we interpret shooting with a laser beam just like shooting photons one at a time? If we think of a laser beam as millions of photons, that we are shooting them at the same time, why can't we just think of each photon as following the wave function (which is a probability function) and ending up on a spot on the backstop?Why we think of the laser beam as a real wave that interacts with itself to make an interference pattern?
