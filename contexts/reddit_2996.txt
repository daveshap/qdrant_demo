Work from home jobs?
I am trying to plan my long term career and working from home would be ideal. Iâ€™m looking for weekends off and to be home with the dogs as much as possible.

I have not yet started college and I currently work a retail job with 10 hour days and working most weekends. They are flexible so at any point that I want to start college I am able to do so and keep my current job.

What work from home jobs have you (anyone) had/do you have and how much school goes into it? Do you work from a laptop or desktop? What do you do from home?
