My nana died last night.
If I'm honest, I don't even know how I feel. I'm devastated, but for some reason I'm scared and worried too. I haven't slept, and I went out and got drunk but that made me feel worse and I don't know what to do. 

I miss her so much, the house isn't the same any more. She lived with us, and it's like there's nothing left in the house any more. Fuck.
