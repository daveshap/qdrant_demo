Returning to a passed up position?
The story so far:  

A few months ago, in January to be exact, I was offered a job at a local extermination company that I had applied to. The job had decent benefits (medical & dental, 401K, paid holidays, sick & vacation time, weekends off, etc.) and paid much more than the part time job I was working at the time.  

A couple of days before I was going to start the job I was contacted by  the NYSDOCCS and was offered a job there, again this paid more than what I was going to be paid at the pest management agency. I went in to the agency and let the managers know that I was going to be going upstate to begin working in Albany.  

I was only at he academy a week before I seriously injured myself in a car accident, which prevented me from returning. I had a lot of time to think about it and I decided that the lifestyle I would have to live working with the NYSDOCCS was not one I wanted. There's nothing wrong with it, but it isn't for me.

I recently saw that the extermination job is once again hiring. I e-mailed my resume to them once again in hopes of getting a position there, and friend of mine who works there has also told me they're hiring a lot of new employees.

I was planning on walking in and trying to speak with a manager in trying to get them to offer me the position once more. When they originally hired me they seemed enthusiastic about me starting.  

Is walking in a bad idea? Should I call first? What's the best possible course of action I can take in trying to get a job at this agency once again?
