What is the evidence for and against China being a competitor and/or threat to U.S. power?
I know very little of global politics and can only understand from the bits and pieces that I read from history about how China came into being as a superpower.

For multiple times, I was exposed to this idea that China [is slowly growing in power since the Cold War and is being seen as the replacement of the USSR](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/330543467_Study_on_the_rise_of_China_as_a_dangerous_superpower) and as a threat against the U.S. - the superpower that wants [to compete against the U.S.](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/02/us-china-allies-competition/606637/) or the Western world in general, whether it is

* politically (like the [unlimited terms of the Chinese president](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-43361276) and has a [social score system](https://www.businessinsider.com/china-social-credit-system-punishments-and-rewards-explained-2018-4#a-prototype-blacklist-already-exists-and-has-been-used-to-punish-people-8) which can potentially be a tool for a fascist movement including other questionable actions such as [re-education camps for Muslims in China](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-50511063) and [censorship in China](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/media-censorship-china) ),
* militarily (because of [its growing military](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/chinas-modernizing-military))
* or economically (becuase of its growing economic projects such as [the development of the silk road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belt_and_Road_Initiative) and even a maritime trade route which can be seen as the second silk road and [the economic interests in Africa](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/081315/3-reasons-why-chinese-invest-africa.asp))

Is there any substantial evidence to support the claim that China can be seen as a threat by the U.S. or even the Western world in general, or can be seen as a threat in the near future?

Or are there any evidence that does not support this claim despite the ongoing growth in China as a superpower?
