ANABEL: You two timing psychotic bastard.
CASANOVA: Darling, you've got the wrong idea.
ANABEL: Do I?
CASANOVA: I was only strangling her... I've killed hundreds of women. It doesn't mean a thing. Pootchkie, you're over-reacting. This is our night. It's what we've lied for... cheated for... murdered for. She's just a plaything, a trifle... You're the only woman who's ever meant anything to me. I adore you. I worship you. I want to make you my bride.
