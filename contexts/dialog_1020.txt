LLOYD: Coming?
KAREN: In a minute...
KAREN: You mustn't mind Margo too much, even if I do...
EVE: But there must be some reason, something I've done without knowing...
KAREN: The reason is Margo and don't try to figure it out. Einstein couldn't.
EVE: If I thought I'd offended her, of all people-
KAREN: Eve. I'm fond of Margo too. But I know Margo. And every now and then there is nothing I want to do so much as to kick her right square in the pants.
EVE: Well - if she's got to pick on someone, I'd just as soon it was me.
