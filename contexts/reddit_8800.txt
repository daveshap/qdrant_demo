Which measurements of economic performance does the Executive Branch have the most impact on?
Just as an example, consider unemployment rate. According to a [National Public Radio article](http://www.npr.org/2017/01/07/508600239/what-kind-of-jobs-president-has-obama-been-in-8-charts), the unemployment rate for the last jobs report under Obama was 4.7%, down from a peak of 10% in 2009. The White House also touted steady job growth under the Obama administration, according to the same article.

So, how much impact does an administration have over these and other measures of economic performance?
