BOB: YOU'RE OUT OF ORDER!
DAVID: Why am I out of order?
BOB: BECAUSE I WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO TURN THIS COURTROOM INTO A CIRCUS!
DAVID: Well I don't think it's a circus. And I don't think they do either.
BOB: THIS BEHAVIOR WILL STOP AT ONCE.
DAVID: But see that's just the point. It can't stop at once. Because it's in you. And you can't stop something that's in you.
BOB: It's not in ME.
DAVID: Oh sure it is.
BOB: No it isn't.
