CHEF: Captain -- they've been probed all this week -- Cong and NVA regulars. There's gonna be a big offense any time.
WILLARD: I know.
CHEF: What are we doing here?
WILLARD: Kurtz. I'm supposed to kill him, just like he said.
KURTZ: Yeah, I can see that. He's fuckin nuts --
WILLARD: Yeah.
CHEF: He killed that guy without feeling anything.
WILLARD: Not a thing.
CHEF: When you kill Cong, don't you feel something.
WILLARD: Sure. Recoil... I feel the recoil of my rifle.
