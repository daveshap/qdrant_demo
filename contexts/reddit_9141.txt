Financially F*****, thanks covid.
 

For those of you who have been following my posts, you may know i started my career in security as a homeless man. Early last year, I got myself out of homelessness. 

Shortly after the pandemic, my leaseholder went awol. Won't answer phones, text messages, emails, nothing.

Today the property owner came, demanding his back rent. Despite explaining the situation, showing him proof, and practically begging for time, the man was adamant that we had to pay if we wanted to stay here.

Since none of us can come up with $6000 and I'm still looking for steady work, we will all likely be kicked out.

The other three have somewhere else to go. I don't. So for me, it's back to the shelter.

one of my clients has a real estate attorney in my inbox giving me some useful information. Turns out, even if there wasn't a pandemic, the landlord is going to have a Hard time evicting us.

I can't say I know the specific laws he's using, but one of the people here is a saleswoman. So she's gonna work her magic and see what can be done.

Meanwhile, I've been binge applying to every company I can find. Flipping burgers, serving coffee, executive protection service, bag boy, p\*\*\* star, Consultant, Food distribution at a food bank, you name it. I haven't slept yet so that's a factor working on me. Let's see what happens.

Wish me luck! Because despite the tragedy in this story, I still have a significant amount of a\*\* to kick!
