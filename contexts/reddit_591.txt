Quiet rebellion
So I've been cutting my hair for the last three days and my mom hasn't noticed. I've been wanting short hair for awhile but my mom said no very disappointed. I don't really know what I'm doing. Should I find another way or continue until she notices. I've told my dad and he seems chill. I plan on asking a friend to even it out so it doesn't look bad while im cutting it during the night time. Does anyone know what I can do to prevent my mom from knowing sooner than wanted?
