CHARLIE: Uncle, how are you feeling?
GIOVANNI: Fine. Did you have a good time last night?
CHARLIE: About that shooting last night...I was there and...
GIOVANNI: No you weren't.
CHARLIE: You're right uncle. I must have gotten it confused with something else.
GIOVANNI: Yes, you did.
CHARLIE: About Oscar...I think he put on this act...about the restaurant being in bad shape and all that. He can't make the payments...I don't know what to make of it. He says Groppi's run off with a girl. I could help if you want.
GIOVANNI: No...his business is bad. But I'll decide what to do and you...and you just keep out of anything that might...might...er draw attention to you.
