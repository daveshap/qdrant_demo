MERLIN: It is whispered in the forest that... ...Leondegrance's castle is under siege by Lot and Uryens.
ARTHUR: Yes, yes, I know that. Everybody does. Lord Leondegrance is my only ally among the barons and the great knights. I can't lose him.
MERLIN: Well there. You don't need me half as much as you think you do. You already know what must not happen.
ARTHUR: I must find the means to save him, then. I was hoping I could ask you for a little magic help, but if it makes you so tired...
MERLIN: Thank you.
ARTHUR: It's just that I have no experience, and no men to speak of. How can I--
MERLIN: Because you must! You and only you. Have you forgotten that it was you who freed Excalibur?
