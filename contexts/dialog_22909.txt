CONSTANCE: Lloyd?
LLOYD: Hey, sis.
CONSTANCE: I'm sorry. Sam had to do a new crown, we had [?], and Jason had a sore throat. Your big graduation, and no one was there.
LLOYD: It's no problem. I called Mom and Dad in Germany; it's like they were there.
CONSTANCE: I hope you understand.
LLOYD: Hey, bad throat, huh J-man?
JASON: Yeah.
LLOYD: Yeah, you gotta go 'YEAH', strength. Poor little man.
CONSTANCE: Why do you eat that stuff? There's no food in your food. Not too loud, the red line's there for a reason.
LLOYD: How do you know how to draw the red line anyway?
CONSTANCE: Because it's loud enough so the neighbors don't complain, that's how come I know.
LLOYD: Good thing there's not a red line on you, J-man. YEAH!
JASON: YEAH!
LLOYD: He's back. Hey my brother, can I borrow a copy of your 'Hey Soul Classics'?
JASON: No my brother, you have to go buy your own.
LLOYD: Hook up the jab, hook up the jab.
CONSTANCE: Why can't you be his uncle and not his playmate?
LLOYD: Jesus Christ. I get in a good mood. How hard is it just to decide to be in a good mood, and then be in a good mood?
CONSTANCE: Gee, it's easy.
LLOYD: Look, I'm really sorry that Mom and Dad made you take me in. Really. If it's such a big deal, I'll go. But remember this, it used to be fun. It used to be warped, twisted and hilarious, and I mean that in the best possible way, I mean it as a compliment. I mean, I'm sorry T-I-M left you. But I am not T-I-M.
CONSTANCE: I was hilarious once, wasn't I?
LLOYD: Yeah.
CONSTANCE: I still am.
DIANE: Dad, you have to teach me to suture this weekend.
JIM: Okay, I promise I will. Just come here a minute, I want to show you something.
DIANE: What are you doing?
JIM: Well, since I'm not only your father, I'm also your friend; I had to get you two presents.
DIANE: God, that's... this is ridiculous.
JIM: Now this is the only thing your mother ever gave me that I kept. Now it's yours. Go ahead, open it.
DIANE: Oh god, I don't need all these presents. I don't know any kid who got a car, I mean...
JIM: They really applauded you today honey.
DIANE: I was standing up there and looking at all the people, and I felt like they didn't know me. I mean, maybe I shouldn't have taken all those courses out of school, because everybody thinks I... forget it.
JIM: No, wait a minute. Everybody thinks you're what?
DIANE: Everybody thinks I'm a priss.
JIM: Diane, in a million years, you could never be a... priss. It's all working out for you honey, don't you see? It's all working out, just like we planned. All the years of summer school, all the vacations you gave up, it's all working out just the way we planned...
DIANE: Stop it, stop it, stop it.
JIM: I'm sorry.
DIANE: I love you dad.
JIM: I love you too honey.
