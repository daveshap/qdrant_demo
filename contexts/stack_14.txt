Macbook Air - Blinking folder at startup on occasion I have a Macbook Air (mid 2012) which has some various problems. The main problem is that the computer will occasionally display a blinking folder at startup. Whenever that happens I do one of the following things, until I can boot into the computer again that is.Reset the NVRAMTry to boot into safe modeRepair the start up diskChoose the right disk as the start up diskVarious keys getting bashedBesides the blinking folder problem, 3 beeps can be heard at start up.I have tried to reinstall the OS a couple of times, but that hasn't helped at all. So my solution is to keep the Macbook running with Amphetamine, basically never shutting it off to avoid these problems. But this is quite troublesome whenever wanting to travel with the computer, so I was wondering if any of you have any ideas how I could mitigate all these problems?Thanks in advance
