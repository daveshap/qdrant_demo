What are the ways I can use a recruiter's help to get a job?
So I've connected with 3 recruiters in the past, but I have not really contacted them since the initial contact. I don't know how or what I can ask a recruiter. I don't really understand the kind of relationship a recruiter or recruitee have to know how to go about contact for help or guidance on anything. I also really need a decent paying job and have a degree, but haven't really go a real career job before. The jobs I had before didn't even require a bachelors degree. I already understand they get paid a percentage of my paycheck. 

Can you share what you know about recruiters and how they have helped you get into a career or change careers? How do I develop a professional relationship and know what things can be asked, and such?

Edit: Thank you so much for your responses!!
