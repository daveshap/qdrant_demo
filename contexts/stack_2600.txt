Sorting by row already pre-selected polygons by location by line? I have two layers. One with small Polygons and one with a line. I want to select all Polygons which intersect with the line. Additionally the selected Polygons should be sorted by the order of the line, as a line has always a start and a end. The first polygon that intersects at the start of the line should be on top of the attribute table. The second one on second place and so on.
