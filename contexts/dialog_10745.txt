JOSH: Do you want something to drink?
ENID: Why?
JOSH: What do you mean why"?"
ENID: Are you trying to get me wasted so you can take advantage of my womanly charms?
JOSH: Yeah, right...
ENID: Yeah
JOSH: Nothing.
ENID: Then why do you hate me so much?
JOSH: When did I say I hated you?
ENID: You've never once said anything even remotely nice to me.
JOSH: You make me nervous! I always feel like you're going out of your way to make me feel uncomfortable so you can laugh at me!
ENID: That's just the way I am!
JOSH: Yeah, well --
ENID: It's just my stupid way of getting attention! God, I practically love you, Josh!
