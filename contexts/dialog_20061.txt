FOLEY: What's your name, boy?
ZACK: Mayo, Zack Mayo, sir!
FOLEY: How did you slip into this program, Mayo? I didn't know the Navy was so hard up. You got an injury there, Mayo?
ZACK: Not exactly, sir.
FOLEY: Where'd you get this, Mayo? This is really wonder work.
ZACK: Subic Bay, sir. In the Philippines.
FOLEY: I thought I recognized the work. Be proud of those wings. They're the only ones you're gonna leave here with, Mayo-naise.
