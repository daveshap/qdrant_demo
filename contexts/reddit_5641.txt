I feel very stuck in my position
So I graduated with a bachelors degree in sports management and business administration. I am currently working in my MBA which I will finish in May 2021. I got a job as a claims adjuster and they aren’t onboard if people because of COVID-19 so I started working at Home Depot. I try to apply for other jobs but it’s hard to get a job with little experience and being fresh out of college. I want to get the ball rolling on my career so I want to keep applying for other jobs but that claims adjuster position looks great and it pays well. Should I just keep applying and praying? Maybe I’m just being impatient. Any help would be great.
