How to follow up on “I can’t hire you now, but want to next quarter.”
Hey guys, I’ll try to keep it short. Looking for quick advice. I was very close towards a new job back in October but was rejected after the decision came down between me and another guy. During the call, the manager (who would be my boss, not HR) explained he is looking to hire again Q1 2020, really liked me with a role in mind, and has “my resume pinned near his desk to remind him.” He seems genuine but I understand this could also be BS. 

Regardless, I wanted to follow up post-Christmas to show continued interest, reliability, and solid business  communication. I also fear as coming off too pushy. Do I send this email and more specifically, how do I phrase it? Make it a simple holiday message or focus on bringing up the job again (the positioning he is hiring in Q1 has not been posted for applications)?

Thanks for the future help!
