BRUCE: Two drinks and I start swinging from the rooftops. Look, I bore myself silly. Let's talk about you. How the hell did you wind up in Corto Maltese?
VICKI: That's a tough one. Have you ever seen combat?
BRUCE: No.
VICKI: Neither had I. Odd desire for a woman, I guess.
BRUCE: Odd desire for anyone.
VICKI: Well. A couple of years ago when their president was requesting aid I went down there for Newsweek. The beaches were nice. And at nights -- they had a band -- I danced on the hotel patio. Of course I never saw what was really happening there. When the war broke out I had to go back. And I promised myself that this time... I wouldn't look away.
BRUCE: What did you see?
VICKI: ... Terror.
BRUCE: There's terror everywhere. If you train yourself to look for it.
VICKI: Well, Bruce, some types are a little more obvious than others.
