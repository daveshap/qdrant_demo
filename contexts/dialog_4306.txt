MICHAEL: Explain to me again why we didn't do this in Des Moines in an air conditioned office?
CAROLYN: Mom's orders.
MICHAEL: Lawyer here?
CAROLYN: I have some sandwich fixings if you're hungry.
BETTY: No, we just had lunch at the hotel with my brother and his new wife. She told me all the dirt. I forgot how interesting things can get around here. It was so good to see them. The last time we visited they were in Europe. He is doing so well. He ordered champagne. For lunch! I nearly died.
MICHAEL: I nearly died when we split the bill.
BETTY: Michael doesn't understand. People who make the kind of money my brother makes don't carry money on them. They keep it all in various accounts.
MICHAEL: Then we should have had lunch at the bank.
BETTY: Boy. It sure has been a long time.
MICHAEL: We were here two Christmases ago.
BETTY: Well, that's a long time.
MICHAEL: It's not that long.
BETTY: Well, why don't I just say black so you can say white! Don't be surprised to find your brother hasn't changed an iota. He hardly ever talks and when he does it's in that tone! You should have heard him at lunch -- not two words until the bill came and then he says, Worth every penny.""
MICHAEL: SO!
BETTY: You said it in that tone! Like you were angry at me, my brother, at the world for forcing you to eat a nice lunch!
MICHAEL: Oh Jesus.
BETTY: I simply can not stand that tone!
