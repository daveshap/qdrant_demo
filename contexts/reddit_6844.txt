My director asked me for a list of my tasks. Am I getting laid off?
I work in FP&A for a public service company. 

On Thursday I got an email from my director asking me to create a list of the tasks I was working on and how much time I spent per month on each by Friday EOD. In the email he said the company was going through a little reorg and he wanted to figure out workloads. He wanted to see granularity in what I was doing. The email was only sent to me and not the rest of my department. 

Does this sound like the beginning of a layoff? Considering he said company reorg and the fact he asked me for a list of what I was working on really sounds suspicious. I've only been with the company since October 2019 and so I'm the most junior in the department and youngest. 

Obviously I don't want to lose my job because of financial reasons but what I'm also really worried about is my career growth. Before this job I worked for a year in Accounts Payable. With only seven months of FP&A experience I'm not sure if I'll be able to find another similar role, especially during this time. I was supposed to be begin training on how to forecast but that had to be delayed. 

When the pandemic started, the company had us going remote and it was business as usual. I still had my daily tasks to do and several times my director would even delegate some work on me. We have Microsoft teams meetings and none of my coworkers were giving me the could shoulder or anything. I've made some mistakes but I fixed them quickly and wasn't reprimanded or anything. So I think at best I know I'm not getting fired. 

I don't know. I guess I'm just a little more on edge just because of whats been going on. Does anyone have any experience with reorgs? Any insights? Advice? This is in San Diego.
