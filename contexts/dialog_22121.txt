HOLDAWAY: Didja use the commode story?
FREDDY: Fuckin' A. I tell it real good, too.
FREDDY: What's this?
HOLDAWAY: It's a scene. Memorize it.
FREDDY: What?
HOLDAWAY: A undercover cop has got to be Marlon Brando. To do this job you got to be a great actor. You got to be naturalistic. You got to be naturalistic as hell. If you ain't a great actor you're a bad actor, and bad acting is bullshit in this job.
FREDDY: But what is this?
HOLDAWAY: It's a amusing anecdote about a drug deal.
FREDDY: What?
HOLDAWAY: Something funny that happened to you while you were doing a job.
FREDDY: I gotta memorize all this shit?
HOLDAWAY: It's like a joke. You remember what's important, and the rest you make your own. The only way to make it your own is to keep sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it.
FREDDY: I can do that.
HOLDAWAY: The things you gotta remember are the details. It's the details that sell your story. Now this story takes place in this men's room. So you gotta know the details about this men's room. You gotta know they got a blower instead of a towel to dry your hands. You gotta know the stalls ain't got no doors. You gotta know whether they got liquid or powdered soap, whether they got hot water or not, 'cause if you do your job when you tell your story, everybody should believe it. And if you tell your story to somebody who's actually taken a piss in this men's room, and you get one detail they remember right, they'll swear by you.
