Background checks and omitting short term jobs due to termination
So I omitted a short term job from my resume due to termination for low performance. I never mentioned it, and it wasn't brought up during an interview. I currently have this temporary job offered to me, so the background check will be done by the temp agency. Do you think they will dig extensively for your entire employment history, or will it be like a W2 upload of documents to the temp agency's background check website just to verify the jobs on your resume (every other job I had was good)?
