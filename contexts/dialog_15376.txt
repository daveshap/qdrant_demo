FRANK: I don't think it matters. Last nights victim, Christie Eastman was found in a warehouse on the outskirts of town. The night before, Debi Rutlege was found in the center.
KATHY: Meaning?
ANDY: Meaning, it looks like his victims are chosen at random.
PETER: No.
ANDY: What do you mean, no?
PETER: He says it's a game. All games have a strategy.
ANDY: All you gotta do is look at the map.
PETER: His victims aren't random. It only means that they appear to be random. There's a connection, we just have to find it.
PETER: What have you come up with on the riddle?
FRANK: Wee Willie Winkie runs though the street." We think he might be making a reference to himself."
PETER: Maybe, but I don't think so. I think it's just a tease.
FRANK: Upstairs and downstairs in his night gown -- He could be saying the house he's picked is two stories.
