Can a county adopt as a policy to "not enforce the law"?
Recently a federal court stated that:

>In 2010, the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors adopted a Resolution prohibiting... from using County resources to pursue an individual solely because of an actual or suspected violation of immigration law

I am not familiar with how this works in terms of county enforcement of inmigration law. Is this sort of refusal by Santa Clara County legal?
