nostalgia hurts
I live in a lower-middle class household in SmallTown, USA. So, vacations are a big deal for my family. Any time we can afford it, we rent this sizable cabin for Labor Day weekend. 

The last time I went to said cabin, I took my first girlfriend with me. We made a lot of memories there. Since it was my first relationship, ever, it is taking me awhile to move on. And so, when I recall a memory, I get quite upset. The cabin contains a lot of fond memories, and I'm afraid of losing my shit if I go with my family this year. I'm afraid of being pitied after telling family members we're no longer together. Im at a loss of what to do. I simply cannot not go there. It would confuse/hurt my family, or both.
