MAC: How's he doing?
SALLY: Not good.
GINA: He's gonna miss his flight.
SALLY: Yeah.
GINA: Is he not going? I booked a flight.
SALLY: He's not going tonight.
GINA: I told his father he'd be on that flight.
SALLY: Well you could tell him otherwise. It was good of you to be all this help. But he doesn't want to go tonight.
GINA: Jesus, Sally. I'm not the enemy.
SALLY: And you're not the wife.
GINA: It's not a contest.
SALLY: Damn straight.
