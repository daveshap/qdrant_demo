This might be a silly thing for some people but I made a phone call!!!
I have extreme anxiety with the phone. I don't know but it stresses me out. I got a call from my doctor and let it go to voicemail as usual. But I said fuck it. Practiced what I was going to say a million times and called back. I was shaking the whole time but I did it and I'm really proud of myself. I'm slowly exposing myself to social things and this was the first step!
