WOODWARD: Hunt is Colson's man-- --that's Charles Colson, Nixon's special counsel-- --they both went to Brown University-- --Hunt worked for the C.I.A. till '70, and this is on deep background, the FBI thinks he's involved with the break-in.
SIMONS: What else have you got?
WOODWARD: According to White House personnel, Hunt definitely works there as a consultant for Colson.

ROSENFELD: I think we got a White House consultant linked to the bugging.
