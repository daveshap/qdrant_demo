JOE: Okay, Sugar - all clear. You better go back to bed.
SUGAR: I might as well stay in there. I won't be able to sleep anyway.
JOE: Why not?
SUGAR: Bienstock. He snores to beat the band. We cut cards to see who sleeps over him, and I always lose. Wouldn't you know?
JOE: Want to switch berths with me?
SUGAR: Would you mind terribly?
JOE: Not at all.
