Room Change Process?
Hey guys, I'm slightly new to the Residence Life/ Student Affairs scene. I'm looking to compare and contrast college room change processes. Our's is currently "one week of open room change, three weeks into the semester. residents can move rooms/change roommates for that whole week, no paper work necessary besides the typical Room Condition Forms and confirmation of living space." Afterwards, it would have to be an emergency in order for them to change rooms, or we do medications, and try to solve any particular issues the roommates have. 

My problem being is that I feel this can be refined. We all have residents who can do better in academics and in comfort of the college campus in general just based off how well they get along with their roommate. 

I'd like to compare and research some different room change processes.

tl;dr: What are your college's/University's room change processes and why do they work?
