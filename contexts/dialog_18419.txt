SENATOR: Where were you?
JEFFERSON: To--to a reception--uh--for a princess-- I forget her name--
CHAIRMAN: And you say you never signed this contract with Mr. Allen?
JEFFERSON: I did not--
CHAIRMAN: You've never *seen* this contract.
JEFFERSON: Never.
CHAIRMAN: But you did *talk* to Mr. Allen about that and--?
JEFFERSON: I--I discussed it with him--yes-- because I--you see, I've always had this camp in mind--but I made no contract with him!
CHAIRMAN: Then--this is *not* you signature, Senator?
JEFFERSON: Looks like it, but--
CHAIRMAN: But it *isn't*?
JEFFERSON: It couldn't be.
CHAIRMAN: You are saying, in effect, that this is a forgery?
JEFFERSON: I'm saying I didn't sign it!
