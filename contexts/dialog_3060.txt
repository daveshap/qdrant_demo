FREEZE: Their bones will turn to ice. Their blood will freeze in my hands.
IVY: Kill them. Of course. But why stop there? Why should only Batman and Robin die while the society that created them goes unpunished?
FREEZE: Yes. I shall replay the world for sentencing me to a life without the warmth of human comfort. I will blanket the city in endless winter. First Gotham and then the world.
IVY: Just what I had in mind. Everything dead on Earth except us. A chance for mother nature to start again. Plants and flowers are the oldest species on the planet yet they are defenseless against man. Sorry hon, this is for science. Behold the dawn of a new age.
IVY: I have created a race of plants with the strength of the deadliest animals. Once you have frozen mankind, my mutants will overrun the globe. The Earth will become a brave new world of only plants. And we shall rule them. For we will be the only two people left in the world.
FREEZE: Adam and Evil.
FREEZE: You will distract the bat and bird while I prepare to freeze Gotham.
IVY: Can't we just ice them along with the rest of the citizenry?
FREEZE: That is far too merciful. Batman will watch his beloved Gotham perish, then I will kill him.
IVY: As a team, the duncely duo protect each other. But the Robin is young. Impetuous. If I could get him alone-
FREEZE: One kiss and you could lift the mask from his lifeless face. Their secret identities would be revealed. But how best to bait a brid?
IVY: The way to a boy's heart is through his ego. What strapping young hero could resist his very own...signal?
FREEZE: Inspired, Ms. Ivy.
IVY: I'm hungry. I think I'll have poultry.
