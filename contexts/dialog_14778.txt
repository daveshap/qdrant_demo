HELENA: Don't say that. Don't you <u>dare</u> say that .. <u>I believe you</u> ..
BERLIN: I know you're trying to help me, but you don't understand.
HELENA: <u>Then explain it to me</u>. I got enough darkness, don't I?
BERLIN: The man who killed Amber is a psychopath. He was up at the in- stitute to <u>kill you</u> - he don't wanna kill Rose - he was there to <u>kill you</u> - that's the truth - and I didn't wanna tell it to you - but that's the reason I want you to stay at Margie's - coz I can't protect you here ..
HELENA: Why does he want to kill me?
BERLIN: Coz he thinks you're a witness.
HELENA: I can't identify him ..
BERLIN: He don't know that. I didn't.
HELENA: Then why didn't he kill me?
