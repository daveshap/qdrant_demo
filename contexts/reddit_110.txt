Should I make the first move on this guy I’m talking to?
This guy and I have been talking for 3 months now and we both like each other, but I feel like I like him a bit more. I can tell that he gets kinda shy around me which is why I’m thinking about making the first move but I don’t know if I should. We are going to be hanging out soon so I could really use some advice. Thank you!
