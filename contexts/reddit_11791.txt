I feel like I have no one to talk to.
Today I got into a fight with my mom about something so stupid it's irrelevant. But now she is really mad and will not speak to me. 

I apologized to her but she just said that she doesn't want my apology and has not talked to me since. It's been a few hours now. 

I tried talking to my boyfriend about it but he doesn't seem to understand my family dynamics since they're different from his. I cancelled plans with him tonight because I know that leaving would just make the situation with my mom worse. And I think he might be mad.

I have no close friends who I can talk to about something so personal. So, my hope is that strangers of the internet will be helpful and offer some advice if not just say something nice.

I guess what's really bothering me at this point is that I just feel like I'm all alone.
