MOTHER: Jeffrey, YOU THIEF!
RAJA: Mother... it's not what you think!
MOTHER: And why are you wearing that silly costume?
RAJA: Because... I'M A SUPERHERO!
RAJA: Oh, Mother, I'm sorry. I know how much you wanted me to be a doctor or a lawyer with a family -- but it's just not who I am!
MOTHER: But... the silverware?
RAJA: I use it... to fight evil.
MOTHER: Jeffrey... this is wonderful.
RAJA: It is?
MOTHER: I always knew that you were special.
RAJA: You did?
MOTHER: Ever since you were a little boy... Come with me.
