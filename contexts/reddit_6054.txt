My job is starting to invite people back and many people are mad about it
My job has about 200 employees with around 50 of them being Full Time and 150 of them Part Time. We have all been out of work since mid-March but full timer’s have been getting paid while part timer’s stopped being paid at the beginning of May. 

Today my job announced that full time employees will be coming back to work next week. Part timers will continue to be laid off and called back one by one as business needs allow. I’m a part timer so this is disappointing to me. 

The large majority of the full time employees are pissed off that they have to return to work. Many of them saying things like, “The best part about returning will be getting an early release and leaving” or “They might as well kill me than have me work again”. For them, they have been getting paid for doing 0 work and now actually have to work for their paycheck. 

In the opposite situation, us part timer’s are dying to go back as many of us enjoyed our job and will appreciate having a paycheck again. I was due for a promotion literally the day after we were sent home indefinitely and now have no idea if that promotion is in the works for me. It’s honestly frustrating to see so many people wish to work while those who have the opportunity to, make it seem like the worst day of their lives.
