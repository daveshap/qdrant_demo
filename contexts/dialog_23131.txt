SIDNEY: Cotton.
COTTON: Can we talk?
SIDNEY: I don't think that's a good idea.
COTTON: Look, yesterday wasn't my idea. That was all Gale and dollar signs and ratings.
SIDNEY: What do you want from me, Cotton?
COTTON: You could start with an apology.
SIDNEY: I did that.
COTTON: You wrote me a letter. Very cordial. Very appropriate.
SIDNEY: How? What could I say that would make a difference? I took away a year of your life--how do I apologize for that?
COTTON: I wish it was just a year. I lost everything because of you. I have nothing now. Look at me, this is what I've become. A long silence. Sidney is hanging on by threads.
SIDNEY: Cotton, there isn't one day, one hour, one minute when I'm not reminded of what I've done. I have not had one second of reprieve and no therapy or religion or spiritual plane can ever erase what I feel in every vein of my being. And I wish I had in me what you need to hear but I don't think the words exist.
COTTON: I just thought if I saw you face to face, maybe it would help.
SIDNEY: Did it?
COTTON: It helped me realize one thing.
SIDNEY: What?
COTTON: You're a self-obsessed little cunt like your mother.
