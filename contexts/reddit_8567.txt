Is there any distinct connection between Pres. Trump's rhetoric and the recent pipe bombing and synagogue shooting attacks?
This past week there have been two significant seemingly politically related attacks in the US.  There was a spate of attempted pipe bombings of notable Democratic party politicians and activists. On Saturday there was a mass shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh.

Both of these people had accounts on Gab.com and shared conspiracy theories an article on [Bowers from the NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/28/us/gab-robert-bowers-pittsburgh-synagogue-shootings.html):

*"Gab’s reputation for accommodating extremism may have been what drew Mr. Bowers to the site. In January, he signed up for an account, and began sharing anti-Jewish images, conspiracy theories about Jews controlling the world, and criticism of President Trump — whom, he implied, was too accommodating of Jewish influence. He appeared to have other social media accounts, but Gab was where he aired his hatred in full. His bio on the site read, “Jews are the children of Satan,” and a photo on his profile included the number 1488, a reference to Nazism that is popular among white supremacists."*

Whereas Ceasar Syoc also [online and spread messages promoting Trump:](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2018/10/26/who-is-cesar-altieri-sayoc-what-we-know-about-suspected-mail-bomber-arrested-florida/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.1838f7bd0e18)

*"On the Internet and in real life, Cesar Sayoc was not shy about broadcasting his support for Donald Trump and his contempt for those the president might consider enemies.*

*He plastered stickers across his white van — supportive of Trump — alongside images of the president’s critics with red targets over their faces and a large decal that read “CNN sucks.” On Twitter, the 56-year-old trafficked conspiracy theories and ranted about liberal billionaire George Soros, former president Barack Obama, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton and others whose politics were out of line with his."*

There is an article response to [the recent terror attacks on Jew during Shabbat services in a Squirrel Hill Synagogue](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2018/10/29/stop-words-hate-rabbi-urges-leaders-after-synagogue-massacre-trump-keeps-tweeting/?fbclid=IwAR08Ag8qKqafq6uvPTNDbdgu10-o_Q0wZ0hgcY2bwIvJv1hVFLFJI6zIcv8&noredirect=on&utm_term=.d97254c3d3c0) by a Rabbi who says:

*'“It starts with speech,” Myers said to loud applause at a Sunday-evening vigil attended by two U.S. senators. “It has to start with you as our leaders. My words are not intended as political fodder. I address all equally. Stop the words of hate.”'*

While Ben Shapiro on an opinion piece for *The Daily Wire* has this to say about the recent bombs being mailed to prominent politicians and media members:

*"Whom do they blame, without any evidence whatsoever? President Trump. Their case is simple: President Trump uses overheated rhetoric. He has joked about a Congressman body-slamming a reporter; he has called the press the “enemy of the people”; he has used complimentary language about the world’s worst dictatorships; he offered to pay the legal bills for people at his rallies who assaulted protesters. This, apparently, makes him responsible for a loon sending actual pipe bombs to Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, John Brennan, Eric Holder, and other Democrats."*

Trump has specifically targeted some that received bombs individuals including [George Soros](https://www.jta.org/2018/10/05/news-opinion/trump-says-soros-behind-signs-d-c-protest-kavanaugh) and [Hillary Clinton.](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/ny-news-trump-rally-lock-her-up-clinton-0181024-story.html)

Is there factual proof that the divisive language used by Trump (and any other public figures or politicians) had an actual effect linking to these actions?
