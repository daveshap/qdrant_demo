MOTHER MIRIAM: I've just met with the bishop. We're taking you off the case.
MARTHA: You're what?
MOTHER MIRIAM: If we want to hire a psychiatrist for Agnes. we'll find our own, thank you.
MARTHA: One that will ask the questions you want asked.
MOTHER MIRIAM: One that will approach this matter with some objectivity and respect.
MARTHA: For the Church?
MOTHER MIRIAM: For Agnes.
MARTHA: You think she's a saint?
MOTHER MIRIAM: She's been touched by God, yes.
MARTHA: How? How? She hallucinates, stops eating and bleeds spontaneously. Is that supposed to convince me she shouldn't be touched. Give me a miracle.
MOTHER MIRIAM: The father!
MARTHA: Who is he?
MOTHER MIRIAM: Why must he be anybody?
MARTHA: My God, you're as crazy as...
MOTHER MIRIAM: Stop laughing, I don't say it's the truth, I'm saying...
MARTHA: How ?
MOTHER MIRIAM: Don't be ridiculous.
MARTHA: Well give me a reasonable explanation
MOTHER MIRIAM: A miracle is an event without an explanation. If she's capable of putting a hole in her hand without benefit of a nail, why couldn't she split a cell in her womb?
MARTHA: This is insane.
MOTHER MIRIAM: There as no man in the convent on that night and no way for any man to get in or out.
MARTHA: You're saying God did it?
MARTHA: But how did it happen?
MOTHER MIRIAM: You'll never find the answer for everything God did.
MARTHA: I thought you didn't believe in miracles today Mother?
MOTHER MIRIAM: But I want the opportunity to believe. I want the choice to believe.
MARTHA: But what you are choosing to believe is a lie because you won't face the fact that she was raped... or seduced... or that she did the seducing.
MOTHER MIRIAM: She is an innocent.
MARTHA: But she is not an enigma Mother. Everything that Agnes has done is explainable from modern psychiatry. One, two, three, right down the line.
MOTHER MIRIAM: That's what you believe she is? The sum of her psychological parts?
MARTHA: That's what I have to believe...
MOTHER MIRIAM: Then why are you so obsessed with her? You're losing sleep over her? You're thinking about her all the time. You're bent on saving her. Why?
MARTHA: There's a tunnel out of the crypt into the barn. Did you know about that? There's an answer Mother. That's how she got out.
MOTHER MIRIAM: That's crazy. How could she find out about it?
MARTHA: Somebody told her.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Who? That tun... that tunnel hasn't been used in fifty years.
MARTHA: Oh, would you stop lying Mother!
MOTHER MIRIAM: Why would I lie?
MARTHA: Because it's murder we're talking about. Aren't you concerned about what she told us about the other person in her room.
MOTHER MIRIAM: I'm concerned about her health.
MARTHA: Who was that person Mother? Was it you?
MOTHER MIRIAM: If you believe this is murder, it is the Crown attorney you have to talk to, not me. And definitely not Agnes.
MARTHA: All I want is one more week.
LEVEAU: Why? You've done nothing to show any progress.
MARTHA: Yes, that's because I'm getting to her.
LEVEAU: You're getting to all of us Martha, let's face it.
MARTHA: I'll have a decision by next week.
LEVEAU: It's gone on long enough. You're out.
MARTHA: Oh Joe... Joe she didn't kill the baby.
LEVEAU: You have proof?
MARTHA: I'll have it.
LEVEAU: When?
MARTHA: Next week.
LEVEAU: No, no, no...
MARTHA: I can get you new evidence next week.
LEVEAU: No!
MARTHA: Tomorrow... tomorrow, I'll get it by tomorrow. I will.
