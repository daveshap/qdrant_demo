HELEN: For God's sake Peter, leave her out of it. You don't want her, you want me.
PETER: I need her; she's a cop. I have to kill a cop, and then...
HELEN: You've been perfect. Don't spoil the symmetry -- you have to have a male cop.
PETER: I don't care -- she's a cop. That's the important thing. Cop-ness, not sex-ness. It won't be perfect, but it'll be good.
