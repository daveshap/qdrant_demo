INSPECTOR: You were right, Mr. Dickson! Brown didn't have anything to do with it. Here's your man.
DICKSON: Why, you must be crazy. I've known this man for years.
INSPECTOR: He's just confessed. He's been mixed up with the toughest gangsters in town.
DICKSON: Confessed! Cluett, in heaven's name, what got into you?
CLUETT: I don't know. It's all been like a crazy nightmare, Mr. Dickson.
DICKSON: What happened? You're not a thief. How'd you get mixed up with these kind of people?
CLUETT: Gambling - I owed them a lot of money. Last week I lost over fifty thousand dollars!
DICKSON: Fifty thousand dollars!
CLUETT: But I didn't kill that man last night. Honest I didn't, Mr. Dickson!
