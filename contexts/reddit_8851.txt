Did Hillary Clinton commit perjury at the Benghazi hearings?
During [FBI Director Comey's testimony](http://www.c-span.org/video/?412315-1/fbi-director-james-comey-testifies-hillary-clinton-email-probe&live&vod), Republican lawmakers cited two major "untruths" in her Benghazi testimony:

- ["We turned over every work related email."](http://www.politico.com/blogs/james-comey-testimony/2016/07/clinton-untrue-statements-fbi-comey-225216)

Comey's response: "we found work-related emails, thousands that were not returned."

- ["I never received nor sent any material that was marked classified."](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/06/hillary-clinton/fbi-findings-tear-holes-hillary-clintons-email-def/)

Comey's response: "No, there was classified material emailed."

"three of those [work-related emails] were classified at the time they were sent or received."

**My question:** Does this amount to perjury?  Republicans are [already suggesting that it does](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3678420/FBI-head-face-Congress-Clinton-email-investigation.html).

*Other notable discrepancies:*

*1. She claims to have used "one device".  I'm unsure whether Comey's comment that she used "several devices" indicates that she used them simultaneously, or subsequently.*

*2. She claims she did not delete work-related emails from her account, but Comey admitted the evidence on this one is difficult to parse.*

*3. Many documents formerly unclassified have been retroactively "up-classified", which is common practice and speaks to problems within the government itself, rather than Clinton in particular.*
