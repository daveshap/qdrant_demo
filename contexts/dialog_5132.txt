KAYLEIGH: No. I emancipated myself when I was fifteen.
EVAN: Wow. That must've taken some courage.
KAYLEIGH: Not if you remember my dad.
EVAN: Couldn't you have moved in with your mom?
KAYLEIGH: She had a new family. Not enough space for me. Said I should have moved in with her when we were kids. But... whatever.
EVAN: Actually, Kayleigh, the reason I came back to town was to talk to you.
KAYLEIGH: Me? Are you kidding? Why?
EVAN: Remember when I was a kid I had all these blackouts?
KAYLEIGH: Of course.
EVAN: Well, lately some of the memories have begun to come back and I'd kinda like to talk to you about one of them in particular. It'd be a big help.
KAYLEIGH: Well, sure. I'll try to remember. Shoot.
EVAN: When we were kids. Your dad was making a movie. Robin Hood or something?
KAYLEIGH: What do you want to know, Evan?
EVAN: It's just... did he... what happened in the basement?
KAYLEIGH: It was a long time ago.
EVAN: I know, but...
KAYLEIGH: Is that why you came all the way back? To ask a lot of stupid questions about Robin Hood?
EVAN: No, but I think something really bad might've happened to us.
