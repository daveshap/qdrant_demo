I feel like the PhD in English is Silly.
Hear me out: Year 2 PhD student in English here.

You know how we often degrade folks online for over-zealous defenses of Star Wars by saying “Lay off, it’s a movie about space wizards and glow sticks”? Not that we don’t love Star Wars, but in reality it just isn’t worth creating bad feelings over toward one another. 

When I get lengthy email responses to papers I’ve written, I get the same feeling expressed above ^.

I’m struggling financially, I have little to no time in the semester to do the ridiculous lit reviews necessary to appease these professors on final papers, I’m not guaranteed anything remotely close to a job, and we are just writing arbitrary opinions on books—!  So I find it silly to read these comments about my papers lacking source interaction when I can’t bring myself to take this thing seriously at all.

It’s just a vacation away from my former life for me. I just want to teach community college (let me have my composition & maybe one lit class to have fun with students) and be left alone for crying out loud.

TL;DR

PhD in English is a collection of people creating arbitrary opinions about books that often has little to nothing to do with the author/reader relationship on display by regular readers. Therefore, it’s hard for me to take this seriously (even after 6 years of study).
