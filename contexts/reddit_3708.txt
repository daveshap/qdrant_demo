Anyone else never been in a serious relationship?
I’m a 25 female. I’m happy with myself and my life but do get lonely at times and feel like I’m really missing out on having that romantic partner in my life. I know it’ll eventually happen for me but I feel like I’m inexperienced when it comes to relationships when I compare myself to my friends and other people my age... I’m also nervous that when a guy finds out I’ve never been in a relationship, he’ll judge me for it and think that there’s something wrong with me haha. 

Anyone feel the same or have any advice?
