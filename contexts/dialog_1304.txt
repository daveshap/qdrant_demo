HEATHER: Hmm. You know that's really a shitty middle name!
OZ: I know, it sucks!
FINCH: Ah, Stifler's mom! Thank you for letting us have a great party.
STIFLER'S MOM: As if there were any alternative in the matter. Are you enjoying yourself?
FINCH: I'm three sheets to the wind, ma'am!
STIFLER'S MOM: I'm so happy for you. Takes the edge off, doesn't it? And where might your date be?
FINCH: Oh no, no date. Bathroom incident.
STIFLER'S MOM: Pardon me?
FINCH: ...Nevermind. You have anything to drink?
STIFLER'S MOM: I believe the kegs are upstairs.
FINCH: No, no, that's what the cretins drink. I mean alcohol, liquor -- good stuff.
STIFLER'S MOM: All right, I got some scotch.
FINCH: Single malt?
STIFLER'S MOM: Aged eighteen years. Why don't you get the glasses. Behind the bar.
MICHELLE: That is a <u>nasty</u> story!
JIM: I told you.
MICHELLE: You wanna hear a nasty story of mine? It's kind of sexual.
JIM: Yeah, bring it on!
MICHELLE: Well, this one time? At band camp? We were playing this game, I don't know if you know it? But it's called spin the bottle? And I had to kiss this guy named Marc Wander on the lips? And...
KEVIN: You comfortable?
VICKY: Yeah, are you?
KEVIN: Yeah.
VICKY: You sure you're comfortable?
KEVIN: Yeah. Are you sure?
VICKY: Yeah.
KEVIN: Me too.
VICKY: Okay. Did you bring a condom?
KEVIN: Yeah, right here.
KEVIN: So, do you want to be -- I mean, how do you want to do it?
VICKY: I don't know. How do you?
KEVIN: Like, normal style. The...missionary position.
VICKY: Okay.
KEVIN: Yeah Vick?
VICKY: I want to hear you say it.
KEVIN: Okay.
KEVIN: Victoria...I love you.
VICKY: I love you.
OZ: I can't think of anything to say that's not cheesy.
HEATHER: Then don't.
