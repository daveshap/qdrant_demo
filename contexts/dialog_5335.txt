ACE: The good part was, I had Amy back. So, we went home, had the housekeeper stay over, put the kid to bed, I calmed myself down and we went to dinner. I tried to keep things nice and civil, you know. But... hey, twenty-five thousand for three suits? That doesn't make much sense.
ACE: First of all, he's not gonna wear f- thousand-dollar suits. But let's say he did, which he won't. How you gonna get fitted for twenty-five suits in three days? I, um, I mean, how could you get fitted that fast? I can't get fitted that fast, and I pay twice as much.
GINGER: I bought him a watch too.
ACE: Yeah.
GINGER: Yeah.
ACE: But even if you bought him a watch, a really nice watch, one that he thought was nice - and he doesn't know what the fuck a good watch is - so, you go, five, ten, twelve grand?
GINGER: Yeah.
ACE: At the most, which is impossible for him.
ACE: Plus, at the most, three suits, a thousand apiece. That still leaves what? Around ten thousand?
GINGER: Would you knock it off, Sam?
ACE: I'm just tryin' to figure it out.
GINGER: There's nothin' to figure out. I'm home... we're workin' it out.
