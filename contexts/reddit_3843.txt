She said yes!!!
I FINALLY DID IT!  

I proposed to my girlfriend, now fiancée, and guess what? 

SHE SAID YES!!!

We met on coffee meets bagel a year and a half ago. She’s a interior designer/fitness instructor. I’m an accountant/consultant. On paper,  I didn’t think we would have anything in common or even any chemistry but here I am, looking at websites in how to plan a wedding!! 

I’ve been carrying this ring with me for the past two months! I wanted to do it on New Year’s Eve but another engagement stole the show. I was wondering if I should wait until Valentines Day but maybe too obvious. 

But over the weekend, we decided to go out of town as we found this nice hotel in overlooking the water. We were just enjoying each other’s company on the balcony with a warm blanket. And I decided to just go for it!
