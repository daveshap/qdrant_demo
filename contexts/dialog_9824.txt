FORD: Quiet. Tell me you tapped in the police computer and found out lots of good stuff about Art Mooney...
JAZZ: I found a lot of Art Mooneys. None with a police record, though. Not even Synchronicity. Have you checked out Johnny Pinzolo/Crunch's houseboat yet?
FORD: Tonight after I see Don. Some Beverly Hillbilly just hired me to find you-know-fucking-who. Name's Colleen Sutton.
JAZZ: Spooky. I'll process her.
FORD: Cool. Jazz, meet me at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion tonight. I'll have a ticket for you at the door. Some concert. Could be interesting. Dress nice.
DON: I haven't seen her around, and as for who would want to kill Johnny Crunch, line forms to the left. You'd find less people on our planet who wanted him alive.
FORD: Great pipes.
FORD: I've heard cars fuck with more harmony.
DON: Tell me about it. Name's Kyle Troy. Can't we bring up the bass.
