What are some important questions to ask a potential supervisor?
So I have a research component as part of my Masters course and I’m beginning to reach out to supervisors who have interesting projects on offer. 

I’ve heard a supervisor can make or break your research experience, so what are some essential questions I should be asking when I’m interviewing? It would be a bit difficult right now to get a “feel” of the lab/their group as I can’t physically go see them (given the current state of the world)
