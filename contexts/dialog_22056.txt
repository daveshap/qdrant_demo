RUDY: A cowboy. You're going to send me into an Indian casino disguised as a cowboy. Have you thought this entirely through?
GABRIEL: Put it on.
GABRIEL: You're a country-western singer up from Nashville for the the holidays. Visiting your Grandma on the lake, driving into the Tomahawk for some scotch and slots. You only play the slots, you got that? Don't want no dealer friend of yours recognizing you, you sidle up to shoot some craps.
RUDY: What kind of half-ass cowboy plays the slots?
GABRIEL: You do.
RUDY: At least gimme video poker.
GABRIEL: Shut the fuck up. You play what your girlfriend plays. Ashley's going in with you. You talk to her, otherwise you don't talk to nobody. You walk the room as many times as you want, but the second you come out, I want to know the run of the place.
RUDY: Do I get a country-western name?
GABRIEL: You get recognized, convict, You get a country-western funeral.
RUDY: Y'know what, guys? I woke up this morning, I got a really lucky feeling going on. I mean it, I'm feeling that good. I wouldn't be surprised if I walk in there, pull a handle and hit jackpot. Hell, we wouldn't even have to --
GABRIEL: Get out.
