Link to a note in Apple Notes, from another note In Apple Notes on the Mac, is it possible to reference a note from within another note (by way of hyperlink)?So, for example, if I had two notes:<blockquote>  Thoughts about pastries    Pastries are great. Truly wonderful treats. But you know what my favorite types of pastries are? Donuts. I've even made a list of the types of [donuts I've eaten].</blockquote>and<blockquote>  Donuts I've Eaten    Chocolate, Glazed, Frosted, Encrusted\u2026</blockquote>How could I link the text [donuts I've eaten] from the first note to the second note?
