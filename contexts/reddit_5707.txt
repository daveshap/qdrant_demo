I’m a minor trying to get a job
I live about 30 out from the nearest town with a McDonald’s. I’ve taken many trips up there to apply, but it seems like now that the holidays are here,  all the bosses have taken vacations or they are not in and when they are in it seems like they aren’t interested in hiring a minor even though there sign out side says help wanted. The one place that did sound like they were going to hire me said that there might be a job ( over the phone) and he needed my hours. I told him I would text them to him and I had also asked if he could call back to see what shift I could pick up and start working. He ended up not calling me back then I called him the next day (about 1-1:30pm) he doesn’t answer and doesn’t respond to my voice mail I had left him.  Most places flat out told me that they don’t hire minors which saved me lots of time but cut my options to very few. I even signed up on indeed.com just to see if that would help. If I don’t get a job before school starts again I won’t have enough money to pay for car insurance or gas to be able to drive it. Because I can’t get a job my parents think that I’m incompetent in doing anything. And seeing that they are boomers doesn’t surprise me that they are blaming my phone and technology on the problem. I need help BADLY. Any tips any third opinions, I want to hear them all.
