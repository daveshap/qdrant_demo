Should I go back to school...
Hello my name is Erik Tenecela I’m a software Engineer that’s what my job title is I work for GalaxESolutions. My questions is should I go back to school to pursue my degree in computer science I have only 18 credits and also im only 20 years old. I just received this full time job 2 months ago I was just wondering what would be the best decision for me going back to school or is the experience enough for me...

P.S will not having a degree impact my pay? but I will have experience in working real world applications..
