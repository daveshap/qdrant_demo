MOOKIE: Sal, if you want me to deliver any faster, get me a jet rocket or something, cuz I can't run with pizzas, all the cheese ends up on one side and shit.
SAL: I didn't say nuthin'. You must have a guilty conscience. What are you guilty of?
MOOKIE: I'm not guilty of nuthin'.
SAL: You must be guilty of something or you would have never come in saying the things you said.
MOOKIE: C'mon, Sal.
SAL: Where we goin'?
