I got rejected for a job and now being reconsidered
Hi everyone

As the title says, I applied for a job internally and before the interview stage I got rejected on Wednesday and then yesterday (Thursday) I got an email saying that my application is being reconsidered. Does this mean I am going to get an interview or could I still be rejected again before interviewing?
