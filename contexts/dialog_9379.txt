GONZO: Did you see that? Some sonofabitch kicked me in the back.
DUKE: Probably the bartender. He wanted to stomp you for what you said to the waitress.
GONZO: Good God! Let's get out of here! Where's the elevator?
DUKE: Don't go near that elevator. That's just what they want us to do... trap us in a steel box and take us down to the basement.
DUKE: Don't run. They'd like any excuse to shoot us.
GONZO: You drive! I think there's something wrong with me.
