JOHN: So what? Do you just switch off in your head or do you imagine you're with him, or what?
NADIA: Sometimes.
JOHN: Sometimes which?
NADIA: Sometimes neither.
JOHN: Some... What does that mean?
NADIA: There's nothing wrong in liking sex, John.
JOHN: I don't like sex. I don't think I'll be having sex ever again.
NADIA: Why?
JOHN: Well, it's just that the thought trying to charm up an erection in front of a woman, or alone for that matter, makes me want to die.
NADIA: So now you hate all women?
JOHN: I think it's my safest bet, don't you?
NADIA: Oh. I think you will recover okay. I think you got what you paid for.
JOHN: What?
NADIA: You...
JOHN: I got what I paid for.
NADIA: You didn't mind too much.
JOHN: It wasn't what I wanted.
NADIA: So what did you want? I think we understand each other, no?
JOHN: You don't understand me.
NADIA: You don't understand you either.
