MRS. ROBINSON: That I'm a sick and disgusting person.
BEN: Now don't start this.
MRS. ROBINSON: What?
BEN: Don't start acting hurt.
MRS. ROBINSON: Don't you expect me to be a little hurt?
BEN: Mrs. Robinson, you stand there and tell me I'm not good enough for your daughter.
MRS. ROBINSON: Did I say that?
BEN: Of course you did.
MRS. ROBINSON: Benjamin, I want to apologize to you if that's the impression you got.
BEN: Well two minutes ago you told me I wasn't good enough for your daughter. Now you say you're sorry I got that impression.
MRS. ROBINSON: I didn't mean it. I don't think you'd be right for each other. But I would never say you weren't as good a person as she is.
BEN: You wouldn't.
MRS. ROBINSON: Of course I wouldn't.
BEN: What are you doing?
MRS. ROBINSON: Well it's pretty obvious you don't want me around any more.
BEN: Well look -- I was kind of upset there. I'm sorry I said those things.
MRS. ROBINSON: If that's how you feel --
BEN: But it's not.
MRS. ROBINSON: That's all right. I think I can understand why I'm disgusting to you.
BEN: Oh no. Look -- I like you. I wouldn't keep coming here if I didn't like you.
MRS. ROBINSON: But if it's sickening for you --
BEN: It's not! I enjoy it! I look forward to it. It's the one thing I have to look forward to.
MRS. ROBINSON: You don't have to say that.
BEN: Well I wouldn't. I would never say it if it wasn't true.
MRS. ROBINSON: May I stay then?
BEN: Yes. Please. I want you to.
MRS. ROBINSON: Thank you.
BEN: Well don't thank me, because I want you to.
