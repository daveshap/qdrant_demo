A quick tip to avoid accidentally overpaying at the grocery store
I don't know about you guys, but I don't give a shit if my produce is organic or not. To me "Organic" just means "you'll pay more for it and it will go bad faster". So here's a tidbit of knowledge that I carry with me from my days working as a grocery store cashier that maybe not everyone knows: Organic produce is marked with a "9" at the beginning of its produce number. Find the sticker on the fruit or vegetable. If it's a four-digit code, it's normal. If it's a five-digit code and starts with a 9, it's organic. Don't get to checkout and realize the bunch of bananas you grabbed was actually the more expensive ones! 

Have a nice day!
