MR. HENRY: This is my business manager, Rowboat.
ANTHONY: Nice to meet you.
MR. HENRY: That's a sharp jacket.
ANTHONY: Thanks.
ANTHONY: It's hard to get much spin with this kind of paddle.
MR. HENRY: It's called a racquet, Anthony, and you're holding it wrong. That's ghetto play. Hold it like this.
MR. HENRY: You know, your form is for shit, but you've got a hell of a talent.
ANTHONY: Thanks.
