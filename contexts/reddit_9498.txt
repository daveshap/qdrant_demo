Apparently vacation loans are a thing. If you have to buy something with credit you can’t afford it (exceptions being true emergencies, medical, student loans, and mortgage). Please don’t fall for those scams.
A friend of mine posted this on her FB timeline this morning: “Our credit union just sent us an advertisement for a Vacation Loan at 8%.   I'm in shock! Do people actually do that? Take a loan out for a vacation? I refuse to go into debt for derby travel nevermind a for fun just because vacation. Nope! This culture is way to debt happy. SMH”

I didn’t know that was a thing. At all. Please, if you need a vacation, stay away from resorts. Get an Airbnb somewhere, go camping in a state park (or your yard, or whatever), find free events in your city. A vacation shouldn’t cause crippling debt.
