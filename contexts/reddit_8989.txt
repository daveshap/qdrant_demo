Should laws regarding LLCs be changed for the purpose of reducing illegitimate activities?
With the [recent news of Trump profiting significantly this past year from anonymous LLCs](http://www.newsweek.com/trump-real-estate-secret-buyers-777276), there is increased focus on the potential for illegitimate usage of LLCs. [LLCs have both legitimate and illegitimate uses] (https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/06/13/7-reasons-property-buyers-use-llcs-legit-not/102387054/). 


There has been some [recent legislation](https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/jl0451.aspx) to address the abuse of the LLC system. Are there other proposals out there that could reduce the amount of corruption and money-laundering associated with LLCs? Have other countries had success with this issue, or is this a uniquely American issue?
