WHALE: Would you be more comfortable barefoot? Feel free to remove your boots and socks.
CLAY: No. I'm fine.
WHALE: It's a bit like being at the doctor, isn't it? You have to remain perfectly still while I examine and scrutinize you.
WHALE: Dripping? Do you ever eat dripping in this country? The fat from roasts and such, congealed in jars. Used like butter on bread.
CLAY: Sounds like something you feed the dog.
WHALE: It is. Only the poorest families ever ate it. We kept ours in a crockery jar.
CLAY: Your family ate dripping?
WHALE: Of course not. As I said, only poor people --
WHALE: I'm sorry. I've just realized how terribly ironic it all is.
CLAY: What?
WHALE: I've spent most of my life outrunning my past. Now it's flooding all over me.
WHALE: There's something about the openness of your face that makes me want to speak the truth. Yes, my family ate dripping. Beef dripping and four to a bed, and a privy out back in the alley. Are you also from the slums, Mr. Boone?
CLAY: We weren't rich. But we weren't poor either.
WHALE: No, you were middle class, like all Americans.
CLAY: I guess you'd say we lived on the wrong side of the tracks.
WHALE: In Dudley there were more sides of the tracks than any American can imagine. Every Englishman knows his place. And if you forget, there's always someone to remind you. My family had no doubts about who they were. But I was an aberration in that household a freak of nature. I had imagination, cleverness, joy. Where did I get that? Certainly not from them.
