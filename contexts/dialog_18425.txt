PAINE: Will the Senator yield?
PRESIDENT: Order! Will Senator Smith yield to--?
JEFFERSON: Yield *how*, sir?
PAINE: Will he yield for a question?
JEFFERSON: Ah, now, that's better.
PAINE: Will he *yield*?
JEFFERSON: For a *question*.
PAINE: Does my colleague's piece concern Section Forty of the bill--a dam on Willet Creek?
JEFFERSON: It does!
PAINE: Every *aspect* of this matter--the gentleman's attack on that section-- everything--was dealt with in the committee hearing--
JEFFERSON: Mr. President--
PAINE: I wish to ask the gentleman--has he one shred of evidence to add now to the defense he did not give--and *could* not give at that same hearing?
JEFFERSON: I have no defense against forged papers and--
PAINE: The committee ruled otherwise! The gentleman stands guilty as charged. And I believe I speak for all the members when I say that no one cares to hear what a man of his condemned character has to say about *any* section of *any* legislation before this house!
PRESIDENT: Order, gentlemen!
JEFFERSON: Mr. President--I stand guilty as *framed*! Because Section Forty is graft, and I was ready to say so. I was ready to tell you that one man in my state--Mister James Taylor-- was putting that dam through for his own profit!
