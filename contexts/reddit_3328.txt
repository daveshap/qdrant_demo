Anyone quit their job, start a business, fail; and then attempt to go back to corporate? what was your experience like?
Just want to know what others experience was like. I actually was laid off, i didn't quit my job but I started a business unrelated to my current field of work, the business had some success but for external reasons I was forced to close the business. I am now trying to go back to corporate and I just started my job search so I am still very positive I can make it happen. Has anyone else been in this situation? What advice would you give me? For reference, I am in my 30s and the last time I worked in corporate was about 2 years ago.
