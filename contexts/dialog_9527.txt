TYLER: I've got everything. The bombs. The army. I've got Marla.
JACK: Bob is dead, Tyler. The police blew a hole in his head. Was that part of your plan?
TYLER: Bob was a grown man. In any great struggle, there will be casualties. Wouldn't that be implicit in the name? Project Mayhem.""
JACK: Fuck your struggle. I want out.
TYLER: You want out?
JACK: I quit.
TYLER: Not an option, for the most obvious of reasons. You need to get with the program. Seven minutes. Let's get out of here.
JACK: Tyler...
TYLER: What?
JACK: Defuse the bomb.
TYLER: Ask me nicely.
JACK: Defuse the bomb, please.
TYLER: Defuse the bomb?
JACK: Yes.
