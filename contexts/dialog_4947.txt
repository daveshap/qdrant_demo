WALTER: Did you hear that Mr. De Santis? Everyone's really crazy about Dead Cat.
LEONARD: Yes they are, aren't they? Look, why don't you take the rest of the night off, you look tired.
WALTER: Well I don't know -
LEONARD: No, it's Ok...you came in early. Besides, you're creating an incident. When people are applauding they don't order anything.
WALTER: Well...
LEONARD: Look, go home and...work on something. Make another cat.
WALTER: I don't have another cat!
LEONARD: Well make a dog, make a parakeet! I'm sure you'll think of something.
WALTER: A parakeet?
LEONARD: Go home.
WALTER: OK...good night Mr. De Santis!
LEONARD: Good night Walter.
