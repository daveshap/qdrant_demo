SHEA: Looks like we have some animal hairs in here. Maybe some kind of a rodent.
WILL: So is that what all this is? Someone have a problem with us living here?
SHEA: Not someone. Something. I've never felt a presence that strong before.
MAURA: Ok, so we have a...presence. What do we do about it?
SHEA: If we have a troubled spirit here, we have to find out why it's troubled.
AMY: Town records are coming up now.
WILL: What will they tell you?
AMY: I'll be able to do a search, to find out who lived here previously. And who died here.
