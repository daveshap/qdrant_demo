Yesterday, House Republicans released the full text of the bill they hope will fulfill the "replace" part of their "repeal and replace" policy with regards to Obamacare. The 123 page bill contains [the following major changes](http://www.vox.com/2017/3/6/14829526/american-health-care-act-gop-replacement): 

* The individual mandate is removed.  Instead insurers can charge people who have had a 2 month coverage gap up to 130% of normal prices.

* Keeps guaranteed issue and community rating, though age bands permitted are wider.

* Medicaid expansion stops taking new people in 2020.


* Medicaid becomes "per-capita block granted"

* The ban on discrimination based on pre-existing conditions is preserved

* Children can still stay on their parents' coverage until age 26

The plan has already been [criticized](http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/gop-s-obamacare-replacement-plan-faces-four-big-obstacles-n730001) on a number of grounds, with many GOP lawmakers [already stating](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/03/conservatives-revolt-against-gop-obamacare-repeal-replacement/518775/) they oppose it. Criticisms range from it keeping too much of Obamacare's architecture, merely tweaking it rather than properly replacing it, while the left has accused it of favoring the wealthy and not addressing major issues with healthcare in the US.

**Is the new bill viable as an alternative to Obamacare? A solution to America's healthcare issues? Who currently supports and opposes it, and whose support is still needed?**
