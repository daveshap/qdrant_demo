ELIJAH: If I surprise you, let me explain. Menial work teaches us humility.
MALCOLM: Let me do it then.
ELIJAH: No, each of us must relearn that work is the only worthwhile thing. Allah has given you a great gift. Use it wisely, never forgetting that we are nothing, while He is all.
MALCOLM: Allah Akbar.
