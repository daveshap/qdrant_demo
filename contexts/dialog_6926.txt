AMY: Merry Christmas, Irena. I brought you a present.
IRENA: Oh, thank you, Amy.
AMY: You can open it now, I guess. Lois Huggins says that's proper,
IRENA: Oh, how beautiful!
AMY: It reminded me of you, so I bought it. It cost me more than all the others.
IRENA: I shall wear it in my hair!
AMY: Oh, that is more beautiful than I ever imagined it! I wish I could show you to mommy and daddy. I wish you could enjoy Christmas with us.
IRENA: You and I shall enjoy Christmas together. Shall I show you my Christmas gift to you?
AMY: Oh, please!
