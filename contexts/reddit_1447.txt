Does anyone else feeling guilty when doing nothing?
Every time I think about giving myself some "me time" I get extremely guilty and anxious. There's always something else I should be doing or could be doing. My mind will physically not let me have a day off and it's exhausting. Every time I try to just relax and watch a movie I get attacked by my anxiety telling me the things I should be doing and working on and how I'm going to be a failure and how nothing is going to work out.
