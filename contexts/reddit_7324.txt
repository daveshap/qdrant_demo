First day of liquor store training. Any advice?
I'm about to start training for a liquor store clerk position I just applied to and have no experience working as one. Just wondering what I should expect and be prepared for. I've worked at a retail store for two months but quit due to lack of hours and never got around to cash register training. Any do's and dont's or tips to leave a good impression would be greatly appreciated.
