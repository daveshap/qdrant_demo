RUIZ: What the fuck was you told? Don't talk, right?
RICKY: Unless spoken to, ain't that right, Horrace. Didn't you say that?
HORRACE: Don't drag my ass into this --
RICKY: He spoke to me. You want me to dis him?
RUIZ: 'Dis?' 'Dis?' You're not in a position to 'dis', or 'give props', or whatever your Real World sense of fucking decorum tells you to do. You're nothing. You're wallpaper. You're not here to make fucking friends. Asking a motherfucker where he lives. And who the fuck told you 'Red Dragon'?.
BOBBY: We get it. We're sorry.
RUIZ: Now that Limey motherfucker's jumpy and wants to change shit around on me. Maxie's gonna shit a Nokia when he hears about... Aw, shit, I better call him before he hears.
HORRACE: I'm not saying shit to neither of you.
RICKY: Why? What I say bad?
HORRACE: What the fuck, 'Red Dragon?'
RICKY: What? Why am I bad?
BOBBY: How bad is it?
HORRACE: It's bad. Before you even showed up, he said you were Maxie's 'token goons', and not to be trusted. He wanted to TCB alone. I was gonna ride shotgun to keep the English dude above board. Now he's spooked. This shit's snowballing.
BOBBY: When's it going down?
HORRACE: Was gonna be tomorrow morning. Now, who knows?
BOBBY: Shit.
HORRACE: See you later.
RICKY: You really in trouble?
HORRACE: Stop.
RICKY: I'll tell him someone else told me.
HORRACE: Just don't ask me no more shit.
BOBBY: You happy?
RICKY: About what?
BOBBY: Why you gotta make everything difficult?
RICKY: You too?
BOBBY: Yeah, me too. You're a fucking bull in a china shop.
RICKY: Fuck this.
BOBBY: Where do you think you're going?
RICKY: Back in.
BOBBY: You fucking nuts?
RICKY: Work's over. I'm gonna party.
BOBBY: You can't go in there. They know you're with Ruiz.
RICKY: You got that right.
BOBBY: Fuck you. Go then. I'm taking the car.
RICKY: Fine.
