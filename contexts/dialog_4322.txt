ROBERT: Pretty country.
FRANCESCA: Hmm-mmm.
ROBERT: There's a wonderful smell about Iowa -- very particular to this part of the country. Do you know what I mean?
FRANCESCA: No.
ROBERT: I can't describe it. I think it's from the loam in the soil. This very rich, earthy kind of... alive... No. No, that's not right. Can you smell it?
FRANCESCA: Maybe it's because I live here.
ROBERT: That must be it. It's a great smell.
FRANCESCA: Are you from Washington originally?
ROBERT: Uh-huh. Lived there till I was twenty or so and then moved to Chicago when I got married.
FRANCESCA: Oh. When did you move back?
ROBERT: After the divorce.
FRANCESCA: Oh.
ROBERT: How long you been married?
FRANCESCA: Uh... uh... Umm... long time.
ROBERT: You don't look like a native, if you don't mind my saying so.
FRANCESCA: No, I don't mind. I'm not from here. I was born in Italy.
ROBERT: Well, from Italy to Iowa -- that's a story! Whereabouts in Italy?
FRANCESCA: Small town on the Eastern side no one's ever heard of called Bari.
ROBERT: Oh yeah, Bari. I've been there.
FRANCESCA: No, really?
ROBERT: Oh, yeah. Actually, I had an assignment in Greece and I had to go through Bari to get the boat at Brindisi. But it looked so pretty I got off and stayed for a few days. Breathtaking country.
FRANCESCA: You just... got off the train because it looked pretty?
ROBERT: Yeah. Excuse me a sec.
