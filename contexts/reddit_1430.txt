Be aware of your distorted thinking
In general, there are 6 types of distorted thoughts that lead to anxiety.

Personally, being aware of these types of distorted thoughts helps me to identify which of my thoughts are anxiety and which of my thoughts are valid. Being able to identify anxious thinking is the first step in dealing with it. 

1) **Probability Overestimations**- Exaggerated beliefs about the chances of a negative event or outcome happening. 

Examples: Thinking that there is a high chance of dying in a plane crash. Assuming that your best friend doesn't like you anymore because they didn't respond to your text right away. Most "What if..." type thoughts. 

2) **All or Nothing Type Thinking**- Black/White thought patterns, judging everything as good or bad without recognizing that life is, in fact,  mostly "grey area". Judging something as negative when it is actually neutral. This type of thinking plays a big part for people that struggle with perfectionism. 

Examples: Interpreting someones neutral facial expressions as negative because they aren't obviously happy- "If it's not positive than it must be negative". -On diet> eat cupcake> think diet in now ruined> proceed to eat entire XL pizza & wings b/c your diet is "ruined" anyway due to the cupcake. 

3) **Catastrophic Thinking**- Exaggerating the importance of an event or outcome. (Not to be confused with point #1: probability overestimation, although the two are intimately related.) Underestimating your ability to cope in the unlikely event that the "worst possible case" does come true.  

Example: "If this first date doesn't go well I will probably die alone with 80 cats." When in reality, if the date doesn't go well it holds no power over the rest of your life. In reality, 5 minuets after the date is over, it doesn't matter anymore.

"It will ruin my life if my new coworkers don't like me" When in reality, even if they hate you, you can always get a new job, or even be professionally successful without having a personal relationship with your colleagues. 

4) **Personalization**- Blaming yourself and only yourself for negative situations. 

Example "That was an awkward conversation because I am awkward". When in reality the other person has 50% responisibilty for the conversation.

5) **Mind Reading**- Making assumption about what others think. 

Example: "That server was a dick to me because she doesn't like me" when in reality she was just in a bad mood because her husband cheated on her. 

6) **Selective Attention and Memory**- This is the tendency to focus on information that is consistent with your beliefs. If you believe that the world is dangerous or that people don't like you or that you are unworthy etc etc, your brain will pay attention to "evidence" that is consistent with your beliefs. Kind of like how you always notice cars on the road that are the same as yours. 

Example: You notice the 3 people who you perceived to look negative during your presentation and ignore the 15 that looked positive or neutral. Or worse, you perceived the neutral to be negative (see point #2).
