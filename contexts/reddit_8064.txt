Planning an M.S. in Applied Math Focused on Finance with Goal of CS PhD. Thoughts?
I have an undergraduate B.S. degree in pure Mathematics. I'm currently planning on applying for M.S. Programs in Applied Mathematics with a focus on Finance and Business. I will do an internship over the summer.

Of course, I will choose a program with a Master's thesis and I will try to publish journal/conference papers during the degree.

I am currently going to school online in Computer Science taking undergraduate courses. By the time I start my Masters in Applied Math, I will have taken the courses 'Computer Organization I & II', 'Algorithms and Data Structures', 'Operating Systems', 'Graph Theory/Discrete Math II', 'Analysis of Algorithms and Complexity', and 'Database Theory'.

I am working on personal projects in programming. How competitive would this make me for PhD positions in Math or CS?

I assume all of this is important: side/personal projects in Machine Learning, strong letters & personal statement, high gre score, networking, great grades, spending some time on research after graduation.
