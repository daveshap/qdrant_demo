WILLIE: What?
INDIANA: You've got to go to sleep now.
WILLIE: I want to go home...
INDIANA: I don't blame you... this hasn't been what you'd call a fun vacation...
INDIANA: I've spent by life crawling around in caves and tunnels -- I shouldn't have let somebody like Willie go in there with me.
CAPT. BLUMBURTT: Miss Scott panicked?
INDIANA: When she saw the insects she passed out cold. I carried her back to her room. She was sleeping when I re- entered the tunnel to look around.
