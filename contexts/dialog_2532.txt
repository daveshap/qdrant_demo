PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN: Marty, that would alter history.
MARTY: So what? We'd be rich!
PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN: Don't you understand? The mere act of sending matter back in time would change the course of events, and changing history is a responsibility that I do not wish to bear.
MARTY: All I know is you're throwing away an awful lot of money.
PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN: The future, Marty, the future is everything! I built this machine to see the future. So I am going to send Shemp twenty-four hours into the future. You can assist me, if you like.
MARTY: Sure, he agreed quickly.
