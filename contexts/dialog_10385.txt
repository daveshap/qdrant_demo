EUGENE: You really need that much?
JEROME: <i>More</i> than that. You'll get used to it.
EUGENE: God, what <i>wouldn't</i> you do to leave the planet?
JEROME: Leave? Just a few million years ago every atom in this hair--in our bodies--was a part of a star. I don't see it as leaving. I see it as going home.
EUGENE: God, you're serious, aren't you?
JEROME: It's not too late to back out.
EUGENE: You don't know what a relief it is not to be me. Are you sure <i>you</i> want the job?
JEROME: What about you? What's in this for you, Eugene?
EUGENE: Listen, I bag this stuff anyway. It may as well pay my rent.
