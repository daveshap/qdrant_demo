"I wish my dad didn't make so much money so I could get more financial aid"
Says my friend paying $10k a year to attend a fancy ass private school, getting a new iPhone every year, spending $5k to attend test prep classes, buying a beach house, going on vacations to Turks and Caicos, Miami, etc... each year, and literally never having to worry about money ever (except for school of course, which is perfectly understandable).

Yeah I guess it's cool getting need-based financial aid (so blessed for that) but it would be nice to get some nice clothes, buy a new laptop for college, and not have your friends spot you everytime you go out :(

EDIT: Jesus Christ I didn't mean for this to blow up. I fully understand the system and how it screws over the middle/upper middle class. I was in NO WAY saying that it doesn't and I was in NO WAY shitting on people with higher incomes. College is far from affordable unless you're a fricking millionaire.

All I wanted to say was that it's kind of ridiculous to wish that your dad made less money and couldn't afford the luxuries you've gotten in your life just to get more financial aid. That's all... This wasn't an attack.
