Why is Sanders seen favorably by a larger number of Democrats and unfavorably by a smaller number than Clinton yet has lost the Democratic Primary by more than 3 million votes?


Not only that, but his policies are supported by the overwhelming majority of Democratic voters:


64%-16% support single-payer tax-funded healthcare


61%-19% support tax-funded free college tuition


71%-18% support a federal $15 minimum wage


83%-8% support raising taxes on families making >$250,000 per year

So why is it, that despite all of this, more democrats have voted for Hillary Clinton than Bernie Sanders?
