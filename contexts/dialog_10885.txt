HAYES: Hardly the case, Senator.
DEHAVEN: Well, I'm just an old dame without much time left, so you'll pardon me if I jump right in here before they discontinue my blood-type. I am deeply concerned over the Navy's seemingly incontrovertible attitude toward women in the military. Case in point...

HAYES: Madam Senator... this is an internal document of the U.S. Navy. I must seriously question whether --
DEHAVEN: The Navy's conclusion regarding the crash of an F-14 aboard an aircraft carrier. Female aviator, it just so happens. You're familiar with this report and its conclusion, am I right?
HAYES: I was one member of the investigating commission.
DEHAVEN: Yes, I see your signature right here -- twice the size of everyone else's. And your conclusion was pilot error
HAYES: I'm really not prepared for any kind of in-depth review of --
DEHAVEN: I'd like to think our next Secretary of the Navy would be prepared for anything, Mr. Hayes.
HAYES: The commission concluded that the aviator in question failed to execute a proper approach to the carrier.
DEHAVEN: That aside for the moment, I'm struck by the tenor, the ill-spirit of your report... the degrading remarks by other aviators... innuendo about her performance in unrelated situations... even a reference to her sexual activity the weekend prior. In my seven years on this committee, I've never seen a downed aviator treated like this. Never. I'm deeply disturbed by this report, Mr. Hayes. Not just what it bodes for women in the military -- but for your own confirmation as well.
