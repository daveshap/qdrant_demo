GILLIS: Good.
BETTY: What's good about it? I miss him something fierce.
GILLIS: I mean this is good dialogue along in here. It'll play.
BETTY: It will?
GILLIS: Sure. Especially with lots of music underneath, drowning it out.
BETTY: Don't you sometimes hate yourself?
GILLIS: Constantly. No, in all serious- ness, it's really good. It's fun writing again. I'm happy here, honest I am.
BETTY: Who's Norma?
GILLIS: Who's who?
BETTY: I'm sorry. I don't usually read private cigarette cases.
GILLIS: Oh, that. It's from a friend of mine. A middle-aged lady, very foolish and very generous.
BETTY: I'll say. This is solid gold.
GILLIS: I gave her some advice on an idiotic script.
BETTY: It's that old familiar story, you help a timid little soul across a crowded street. She turns out to be a multimillionaire and leaves you all her money.
GILLIS: That's the trouble with you readers. You know all the plots. Now suppose you proof-read page ten while the water boils.
