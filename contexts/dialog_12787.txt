HILDY: What's the matter?
BRUCE: I lost my wallet.
HILDY: The check, Bruce!
BRUCE: That's right here. Gee, it was lucky your telling me about that old newspaper superstition.
HILDY: Yes, wasn't it?
BRUCE: I can't imagine who did it. I can't think of any enemies I have.
HILDY: I'm sure you haven't any.
BRUCE: For a minute, I thought maybe Walter Burns was at the back of it. But then I realized he couldn't have been.
HILDY: Oh, no. How could you ever think of such a thing?
BRUCE: Oh, I realized right away. He's really a very nice fellow, Hildy -- I found that out.
HILDY: Yes, he is... Look, Bruce, we're taking that next train -- and when I say next train, this time I mean it!
BRUCE: Did you finish the interview?
HILDY: The Criminal Courts Building.
HILDY: No -- but I'm sure it'll be all right with Walter.
BRUCE: But, gee, Hildy -- he gave us that insurance business -- and you promised --
HILDY: Well, the story's practically finished. I'll just go upstairs and send it over with a messenger.
