How to remember proposed approach from many papers / journals ?
Throughout my study, I read numerous number of papers that related to my work (I'm in computer science by the way). But when I came across a topic, and it mentioned a specific paper that I have read, most of the time I don't remember how was the solution, only remember what was the problem mentioned in it and what's the output. Meanwhile the important part is to remember HOW.. what people have done (solution) to address the issue. For example I read a paper about recoloring more than 3 times, after 3 months I already forget the solution they proposed, just remember that I have read that paper, I remember it's proposing a faster / realtime recoloring, and I remember the output (even all the images) and what it lacks. But I always forget the solution approach.  
Does this only happen to me ?  
  

In computer science papers, a lot of maths is usually involved, optics, and other complicated approach that sometimes I have never tried to use before in my academic career. Is that why is it hard to remember ? All the complicated and "foreign" part ? Does that mean I've failed to completely understand what I read ? How do I learn to remember this kind of thing ? Any trick / advice on remembering papers / journals ?
