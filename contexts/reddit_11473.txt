My anxiety lets external factors determine my value as a person and assume the worst
Especially the people who I have/had sexual and/or romantic relations with. Then I go through a series of mental rumination. 

No reply even though it's only been a few minutes? They're not interested anymore because they hate me now

Something just "feels" off? It's definitely my fault. What have I done wrong? Why don't they like me?

I guess a little bit of anxiety over someone you're interested in is normal, but mine feels debilitating. I spend so much time thinking about it compulsively, and yes part of that is my clinical ocd, but I just wish I didn't think this way. 

Also makes me think if I'm really THAT desperate or lonely

I'm getting help, and trying, but life is just full of random events that make me anxious :(
