Capstone project vs thesis project
I am applying to grad school right out of my undergraduate program in Cell Biology and am interested in pursuing my masters (party for GPA issues on my end for an eventual PhD program, partly to strengthen an application for jobs). 
I’m looking to work in Bioinformatics. I’ve been told to look for masters programs that also have a thesis requirement.
One program, epidemiology at Dartmouth, has a “capstone project” and an internship requirement rather than a thesis.
Is this program a no go? Or would this provide the experience I’d need?
