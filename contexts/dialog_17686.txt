STEVENS: It's fucked up. I'm sorry...
CROCKETT: Alonzo? What are you talking about? Where are you...?
STEVENS: They had me from the gate.
CROCKETT: I don't understand...
STEVENS: I gave up nothing on you guys. Don't worry. I kept you and Rico out of it. Only the Feds. They're on their own...it's all their deal, anyway, so fuck 'em.
CROCKETT: Alonzo, what's goin' on?!
STEVENS: After I check on Francine and the boys, then I'm gone. Sonny, tell Rico I'm so sorry. I wanted you to know...
CROCKETT: Where are you?
STEVENS: ...look after her. Ask Rico to. Okay? Do that for me. I had to do it. They had me from the gate. Do that. Whatever you can do for them. Okay? Look what I did to them, Sonny...!
CROCKETT: Alonzo...!
STEVENS: Goodbye.
TUBBS: What is it?
CROCKETT: Alonzo...
TUBBS: Stevens?
CROCKETT: Something's wrong.
