PITER: My Lord!
BARON: Piter.
PITER: The Atreides will be leaving Caladan soon, Baron, and I have here your answer from Duke Leto.
BARON: What does Leto say, Piter?
PITER: He wishes to inform you that Vendetta -- as he puts it, using the ancient tongue, the art of Kanly -- is still alive. He does not wish to meet or speak with you.
BARON: I made my peace gesture... the forms of Kanly have been obeyed.
