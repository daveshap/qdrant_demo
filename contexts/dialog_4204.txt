JEFFREY: And that man came out with a third man - this well-dressed guy. Here's the photo. I think a girl named Dorothy Vallens is in trouble with these people. I think Frank has taken her husband and her son.
JEFFREY: I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs, and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and... ...and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. I had to tell you about these things in case it could help.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS: Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?
JEFFREY: I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS: Is Sandy part of this?
JEFFREY: No, not at all.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS: Who knows you have these?
JEFFREY: Only you and the photo lab.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS: You're all through with this now?
JEFFREY: Yes sir. I sure am.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS: For now. Alright, you better be. And Sandy better not be involved with this, I can tell you. Be prepared to come in for further interrogation on this later.
JEFFREY: Yes sir.
SANDY: Everything okay?
JEFFREY: Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?
SANDY: You didn't tell him about me?
JEFFREY: No.
SANDY: I should never had gotten you going on this. Yes Jeffrey. Friday's on!
JEFFREY: Okay. Great!
