Why hasn't the mainstream media been more sceptical of claims of Russian meddling with our election?
A lot of the larger media outlets now implicitly refer to "Russian hacking" and report it near absolute with very little skeptism. See: 

- [WaPo - What you need to know about Russia's election hacking](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2016/12/14/heres-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-cias-assessment-into-russia-hacking-so-far/)
- [NYT - Putin Led a Complex Cyberattack Scheme to Aid Trump, Report Finds](http://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/06/us/politics/donald-trump-wall-hack-russia.html)

They have also quickly and incorrectly asserted that Russia hacked a power grid -

However, many security experts who are highly respected in their fields have read the reports released and are expressing a great deal of scepticism. This has been fairly well covered in the technology industry:

- [ZNet - No smoking gun for Russian DNC hacks](http://www.zdnet.com/article/no-smoking-gun-for-russian-dnc-hacks/)
- [The Intercept - Underwhelming Intel Report Shows Need for Congressional Investigation of DNC Hack](https://theintercept.com/2017/01/06/underwhelming-intel-report-shows-need-for-congressional-investigation-of-dnc-hack/)


The only scepticism I've seen in mainstream media have been from highly partisan sources which hardly will encourage people not sceptical to listen and not the best reporting.

My question: Why hasn't the mainstream media been more sceptical of claims of Russian meddling with our election?
