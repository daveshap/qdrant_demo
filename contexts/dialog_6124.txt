RANDAL: Vermont?
DANTE: Can you believe this?!
RANDAL: He didn't mention it when he called you this morning?
DANTE: Not a fucking word! Slippery shit!
RANDAL: So, what-you're stuck here all day?
DANTE: FUCK!
RANDAL: Why'd you apologize?
DANTE: What?
RANDAL: I heard you apologize. Why? You have every right in the world to be mad.
DANTE: I know.
RANDAL: That seems to be the leitmotif in your life; ever backing down.
DANTE: I don't back down.
RANDAL: Yes, you do. You always back down. You assume blame that isn't yours, you come in when called as opposed to enjoying your day off, you buckle like a belt.
DANTE: You know what pisses me off the most?
RANDAL: The fact that I'm right about your buckling?
DANTE: I'm going to miss the game.
RANDAL: Because you buckled.
DANTE: Would you shut the hell up with that shit? It's not helping.
RANDAL: Don't yell at me, pal.
DANTE: Sorry.
RANDAL: See? There you go again.
DANTE: I can't believe I'm going to miss the game!
RANDAL: At least we're stuck here together.
DANTE: You've got a customer.
