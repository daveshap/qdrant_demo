MARTIN: I'm sitting here, I'm looking at you and I'm having these flashes. You know, flashbacks, of memories. Of us.
KAREN: Really.
MARTIN: Yeah and I'm wondering, how did it go wrong? How did it all... slip away?
KAREN: 'It' didn't slip away, Martin, you did... when you went off to fuck Nicki in the middle of my birthday party.
MARTIN: Yeah. That was a good party.
CHILI: You know, Marty, you were good in The Cyclone.
MARTIN: Martin. It was a beautiful role. All I had to do was find the character's center, the stem I'd used to wind him up and he'd play, man, he'd play.
CHILI: Well, you had it down cold. Watching you in the movie, if I didn't know better I'd have to believe you were a made guy and not acting. Even the fink part. I never met a fink and I hope to God I never do, but how you did it must be the way finks act.
MARTIN: A few weeks before shooting, I went back to Bensonhurst, just to listen to you guys. See, I'm Italian, but I grew up in Tarzana. So I wanted to pick up your rhythms of speech.
CHILI: We talk different?
MARTIN: It's more like your attitude. Your tone, your speech patterns demonstrate a certain confidence in yourselves, in your opinions, your indifference to conventional views.
CHILI: You mean like we don't give a shit.
MARTIN: Yeah. Kinda. Anyway, once I have the authentic sounds of speech, the rhythms, man, the patois, I can actually begin to think the way those guys do, get inside their heads.
