Does working abroad look good on a resume?
I moved to East Asia right after college. I finally secured a job in my field, but I do want to move back to the states. I probably won’t be able to unless I secure a job. Do you think having a job abroad helps with job prospects or gives it any kind advantage? I’m looking to move to NYC because I am in advertising. 

I would have one year of experience and 2 college internships. 

Probably won’t start searching for US jobs until after corona virus. I was just wondering! :)

Thanks!
