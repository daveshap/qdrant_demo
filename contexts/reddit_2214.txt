I can't believe this.
All day I was waiting nervously for 5:30 when my decision was going to come out for my EDII school. I knew it wasn't going to come out at exactly 5:30 but I was certain it definitely would come out around then. My parents, sister, and brother were all super nervous it was so crazy. Eventually, it was 7 o'clock and I was like this thing is never coming. My dad finally said to check the spam and it was literally the fourth email down in the spam so I didn't even see it at first it was just all these other random colleges and I just was like forget it and looked away. And then my dad spotted it and I was like no way. It came out at 5:32 and I didn't see it till after 7. This was crazy. Thank God I got in. I lost an hour and a half of sanity.
