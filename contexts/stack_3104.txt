Horizon Problem: How did different regions of space acquire different temperatures? I'm trying to understand the Horizon Problem.  Inflation describes how non-causally connected parts of the universe (that we see today) could once have been in causal contact.  The reasoning goes that those regions must have been in causal contact to achieve the uniform temperature that we observe and, thus, we need Inflation to explain the uniform temperature of the sky.If the universe started out with the same energy and volume everywhere, and the volume at every point in space grew at exactly the same rate, then how could one part of space be a different temperature than another?
