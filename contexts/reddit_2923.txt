Could I reasonably learn enough Excel to pass a skills assessment over one weekend?
Had an interview for a great position but I definitely oversold my Excel skills and now they want me back for a skills test. I used to be okay, but I'm really really rusty. How realistic would it be to cram over the weekend?

Also, I would welcome any online resources anyone has!

Update: I did the test and it went okay! I actually think I kind of overthought things a bit too much and tried to do formulas where they just wanted manual entry. Thank you all for your helpful advice! Even if I don't get the job, I am much better versed in excel because you, which is always good!
