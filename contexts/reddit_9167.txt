Nobody is talking about this, but millions of Americans woke up this morning (a Friday AND the first of the month) to find that their direct deposit didn’t go in thanks to Capital One
Edit: looks like things are working again. I got kind of angry in the comments-not getting your pay on time can make someone a little irrational and I apologize. The fact remains that a major bank like Capital One proves they can no longer be trusted and they really don’t care about little people like us. 

Carry on.

Inb4 “join a credit union” as some of us don’t have that luxury.

Capital One’s systems apparently have gone down on Thursday night, so millions of us woke up to not getting our direct deposit even though all of our employers have submitted it. Not only is it payday for many people, it’s also the first of the month when rent and other utility bills are due. My landlord is cool currently, but I’ve had plenty who would tell me to pound salt and tack on a late fee of $100 a day.

Not a single media or news outlet has said anything. Capital One purposely disconnected their customer service phone lines, and I had to get the news of this from twitter of all places.  Nobody seems to care that millions of working class people who have jobs and contribute to society and pay taxes are stuck not being able to eat, fill up on gas, or commute to work currently.

Where is our money? How can we continue to keep getting screwed like this? I pay my bills. I work 50 hours a week. I pay my taxes. And I live paycheck to paycheck. 

This kind of stuff cannot go unpunished.
