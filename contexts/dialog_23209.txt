MILLS: Give it to me.
CAPTAIN: How's that?
MILLS: There's nothing that says I have to work with him. If Somerset wants out, goodbye." Give it to me."
SOMERSET: It's too soon for him.
MILLS: Can we talk about this in private?
CAPTAIN: That's not necessary. You're in.
MILLS: Thank you.
CAPTAIN: Go start picking up the pieces. We'll shuffle some paper and try to get you a new partner.
