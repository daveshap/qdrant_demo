Does this count as cheating?
A friend of mine took a course a year ago. Kept his exams for that course.

I am now taking the same course a year later. He hands me the previous exams that were handed back to him. 

Does it count as cheating /violation of academic integrity if I use this exam as a resource to study?

Edit: It was a midterm handed back. Not a final exam. Final exams are usually kept by the professors in my school.
