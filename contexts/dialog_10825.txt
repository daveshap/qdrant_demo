LOUIS: Oh migod! I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that. It was an accident.
JANINE: What are you doing up here?
LOUIS: I was trying to get that smelly green thing. The guys asked me to help out. I'm like the fifth Ghostbuster.
JANINE: Why would you want to be a Ghostbuster if you're already an accountant?
LOUIS: Oh, no, it's just if one of the guys calls in sick or gets hurt.
JANINE: Have you made any plans yet? You know tomorrow is New Year's Eve.
LOUIS: No, I celebrate at the beginning of my corporate tax year which is March first. That way I beat the crowds.
JANINE: That's very practical. I hate going out on New Year's Eve, too.
JANINE: Well, good night, Louis.
LOUIS: Janine, do you feel like maybe getting something to eat on the way home?
JANINE: I'd like to, but I told Dr. Venkman I'd babysit. Do you want to babysit with me?
LOUIS: Oh, sure, that sounds great.
VENKMAN: Don't tell me, let me guess. All-you-can-eat barbecue rib night at the Sizzler?
STANTZ: We're going down into the sewer system to see if we can trace the source of the psycho-reactive slime flow. We thought you might want to come along.
VENKMAN: Darn it! I wish I'd known you were going. I'm stuck with these damn dinner reservations.
SPENGLER: You know, animals and lower life forms often anticipate major disasters. Given the new magnetheric readings we could see a tremendous breeding surge in the cockroach population.
VENKMAN: Roach breeding? Sounds better and better. Dana? The boys are going down under the sewers tonight to look for slime. Egon thinks there might even be some kind of big roach-breeding surge. Should we forget about dinner and go with them instead?
