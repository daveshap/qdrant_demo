Backing up another user\u2019s mid-2013 Macbook Air I have pretty much been a Windows user all my life but a family member has recently given me his mid-2013 i7 Macbook Air. This machine is logged in with his Apple account (I have the credentials) and I would like to reset it and start using it as my own machine with my own Apple account.However, I would like to backup the machine before resetting in case he needs some files from it (he should have retrieved the files already but I\u2019d like to be safe). My concerns are as follows.  He has moved back to the Windows ecosystem and no longer possesses a Mac.  Once I reset the machine with my own Apple account, I don\u2019t know if I will have issue accessing the backup as it might be attached to his Apple account.  I prefer a non-cloud solution, for example, a disk image that can be amounted (ideally from a Windows machine; please see (1)).  If I back up the machine (storage capacity 128 GB) to an external disk with larger capacity, I would like that the unoccupied space of the disk is usable (ideally both with Windows and Mac).How do I best proceed please? Please be detailed if you can as this will be my first Mac exp; however, please assume an otherwise generally competent tech user.
