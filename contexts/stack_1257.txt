Monitor delete statements on a specific table on DB2 LUW BackgroundUser is claiming that records are deleted from a specific table, but nobody knows why. They are not sure if it's an application error or done by a user. Question Is it possible to monitor / catch / trace delete statements executed against a specific table?My first idea was to create an event monitor, but I can't limit it to a specific table or a specific kind of statement.
