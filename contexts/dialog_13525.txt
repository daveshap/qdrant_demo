PRESIDENT: I'm not leaving.
NIMZIKI: We must maintain a working government in a time of crisis...
PRESIDENT: I want the Vice President, Secretary of Defense, the whole Cabinet and the Joint Chiefs taken to a secured location. I'm staying here. I am not going to add to a public hysteria that could cost lives.
NIMZIKI: But, Mr. President...
PRESIDENT: So far these things have not become hostile. For the moment let's assume they won't. Connie, let's issue statements advising people not to panic, to stay home and take cover.
GENERAL GREY: With your permission, Mr. President, I'd like to remain my your side.
PRESIDENT: I had a feeling you would.
GENERAL GREY: Sir, what happens if they do become hostile?
PRESIDENT: Then God help us.
