Can \"the world I find myself in\" be understood in two ways? Simple monologue:<blockquote>  This was not the world I wanted.  But it was the one I found myself in.</blockquote>I understand the second sentence, that the speaker ended living in a world he does not like. However, can this be interpretted also that he also found himself like \"he was able to realize himself\" in that world? Or is such interpretation nonsense?UPDATE: Can you use this sentence in a phylosophical or spiritual way? In the meaning of being at some place in which I \"found myself\"? - This is the church I found myself in. - If not what is the correct way to express that someone found himself at one particular place?UPDATE 2: My issue is the mix of the methaprhorical meaning together with position and stranded preposition (this is the world/church I xxxxx in)... to me that makes the sentense confusing and the question is, whether it is a valid construction.
