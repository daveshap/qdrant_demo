AMY: I have to admit you really have a beautiful home.
WILL: Thank you. If you told me two years ago we'd be living here, I would never have believed it. Do you live around here?
AMY: No, I live about in Wexford. It's about a five hour drive.
WILL: How did you meet Dr. Shea?
AMY: There were a series of lectures about parapsychology at my university. I went and heard him speak, and became fascinated with the idea of hunting ghosts.
WILL: I have to admit I was skeptical. Until now.

WILL: Well, I guess this whole thing was as strange for you as it was for us.

MAURA: Good. I'll start bringing things in.
MAURA: Aubrey, come on down and have some dinner!
AUBREY: Ok...
