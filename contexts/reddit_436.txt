How Do I Become Independent From My Mother
I live with just me and my mother and I feel trapped. She won't let me get a job so I have to be dependent on things such as the car I drive and money. If I try to get a job she'll take away my car so I won't have a way to get to work. I feel like she uses these things in order to manipulate and mentally abuse me so I don't know how to escape the cycle. I'm about to go off to college and I want to use this opportunity to get away from her but she would also have to cosign on my loans so I feel like there's nothing I can do to get away from her.

What can I do to get away from her and become independent?
