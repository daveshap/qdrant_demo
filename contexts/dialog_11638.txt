DR. OATMAN: Why don't you want to go to your high school reunion?
MARTIN: It's in Michigan. Honestly, what do I have in common with those people? Or with anyone?
DR. OATMAN: You went to school with these people.
MARTIN: Come on.
DR. OATMAN: We've spent a lot of time discussing those years. Remember we said that fear is a transfer of the bodily hurt associated by experience with the thing feared, to the thought of the thing. Thus we fear a dog without distinctly imagining its bite.
MARTIN: Shouldn't you be taking notes?
DR. OATMAN: Tell me about your vision of the reunion.
