SETH: What's the story with you two? You a couple of fags?
JACOB: He's my son.
SETH: How does that happen? You don't look Japanese.
JACOB: Neither does he. He looks Vietnamese.
SETH: Oh, well, excuse me all to hell.
JACOB: What's this about, money?
SETH: It's about money, all right, but not yours. You see, me and my brother here are in a little hot water and we need your assistance.
