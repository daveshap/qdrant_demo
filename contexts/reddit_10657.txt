I've come to accept this
I've accepted that I will do nothing with my life. Die alone and miserable.

I've come to accept my death and I embrace it with open arms. Each day drawing it closer, is a day where I am more and more happy knowing that the pain will go away. It sounds cliché but it really feels like it.

I've accepted that life is a flood, washing over me like waves crashing into rock, slowly eroding it away until there is nothing left but rubble and dust. It feel like I have no control in life. That I am just a person looking into another miserable persons life, who is getting worse day by day, slowly succumbing to the poison known as living.

I know that this sounds very cliché, but this is the best way of describing it. Grades are going down, I'm not loving what I do, I don't feel motivated to do anything anymore, feeling of existential dread is grinding against my soul like a grindstone at a knife, but no sharpening it, its dulling it and turning it into something with no porpuse, no love, no happiness. Hope for a better tomorrow is just fiction at this point. I try seeking help. I go to a psychologist and I try to get better myself.

Im thinking of just writing a suicide note for my parents, been writing a diery of all my thoughts, not well written but it gets some of the thoughts out.

But I've reached a serious low point in my life. A point where I'm looking for other people's advice. An outside perspective if you would.

Sorry if there are some mistakes in my English. Not my first language after all.
