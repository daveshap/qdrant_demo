Most of Reddit is severely anti-CISPA, so I came here looking for a neutral perspective
Re-posting my earlier question with some guidance from the mods.

There are a lot of posts out there that focus on what CISPA is and what it will do. The overwhelming consensus on reddit is that it is indeed bad. I've heard a lot of negative things, including that my rights might be infringed if it does pass.

But there are two sides to every story. The bill clearly has some support in Congress, the business community has embraced it, and even some big internet firms like [Google](http://thehill.com/blogs/hillicon-valley/technology/223069-google-acknowledges-lobbying-on-cybersecurity-bill-cispa) are lobbying for it. 

The goal of the [bill](http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:H.R.3523:), according to the title, is to address global cybersecurity threats, which I understand are [an increasing problem.](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/27/us/cyberattacks-are-up-national-security-chief-says.html?_r=0&pagewanted=print)

If I am to form an opinion on a matter, I want to hear and give credence to what people from both sides have to say, and this sub has a reputation for looking at issues with a balanced perspective, so I ask you, /r/NeutralPolitics, is there anything good that can come from passing CISPA?
