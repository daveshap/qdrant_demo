JACK: What happened?
LILI: I don't know. They've hurt the unicorn.
JACK: Who?
LILI: My father and the Baron.
JACK: Damned hunters. It was a trap, and you were the bait!
LILI: I didn't know... I didn't... It was so lovely... he was in my lap like... like a baby... and... I...
JACK: They tricked you.
LILI: My own father...
JACK: How bad was the unicorn's wound?
LILI: It happened so fast. He was hurt and ran away.
JACK: He did run?
LILI: Oh, yes, and the mare with him.
JACK: Good. They'll never catch him. There's not a mount in the kingdom can outrun a unicorn.
JACK: There are many would pay a king's ransom for a few drops of unicorn blood.
LILI: I don't want it on me.
JACK: Its powers are strong.
LILI: I don't want to be reminded of what happened.
JACK: Do you think memory can be washed away like a few spots of blood?
