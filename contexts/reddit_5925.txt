Bachelor's Degree on Resume- Issues and concerns
Hello, I hope to get more responses here. In 2010 I graduated from a local physical accredited college with a Bachelor's in Business Administration. The school closed in 2011. I've kept it off the resume in the beginning as I was tired of being told I was "overqualified" for positions. I ended up moving into the materials testing industry As I am now looking to forward my career and move into management I wish to put this back on. 

My concerns are with background checks, as the school closed the records got transferred to the state. However I do have copies of my diploma and transcripts. 

How do most HR departments handle closed schools with background checks? Has anyone with a closed college ever had issues?
