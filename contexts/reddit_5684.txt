How do you get a job
So I used to work at Taco Bell but like they had walk in interviews so it was really easy to get hired. I quit a few months later because of conflicts with my hours and school but now I need a new job and I’ve been applying like crazy but I don’t even get called back. What can I do to find one. I just need a minimum wage job but even Mc Donald’s won’t call me back.
