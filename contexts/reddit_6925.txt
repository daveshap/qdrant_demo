How do I make recruiters stop talking to me?
I am training to be a call center agent but decided to just get a free English training because my Trainer is toxic, so when I end my training at 2:00 pm I keep getting 'persuade' by these recruiters to try to get me recruited to their company and they heard me speak English fluently, proficient and precise and immediately started to pay attentive to me and started trying to convince me than try to talk to do that to my classmates, which they ignored by the way (I noticed they only talk to people who spoke English as they leave making my escape easy). They're always outside 5 meters away from the building I was training.

All I need is a sentence to make them stop talking without saying no or getting their phone number when the company I am training at already wants me and has to train me to get better at what I can do as a person who took the opportunity to train or try to learn English more fluently.
