JOSEPHINE: Wyatt! My God...
WYATT: Did you ever see the sun come up Over the Rockies? It hits all of A sudden and below there's California and you swear you're Looking at heaven.
WYATT: I have nothing left. I have Nothing to give you. I have no Pride, no dignity, no money. I Don't even know how we'll make a Living. But I promise I'll love You every second of your life.
JOSEPHINE: Don't worry, Wyatt. My family's rich.
