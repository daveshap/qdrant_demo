AGATHA: Can't you see? She just wanted her little girl back.
ANDERTON: Who wanted her little girl back?
AGATHA: The drowning woman. Anne... But it was too late. Her little girl was already gone.
ANDERTON: She died?
AGATHA: She grew up.
ANDERTON: She's still alive?
AGATHA: She's not alive, but she didn't die.
ANDERTON: Oh, Jesus...
LARA: John? What is it?
ANDERTON: How did I not see this? Agatha, who killed you mother? Who killed Anne Lively?
AGATHA: I'm sorry, John, but you have to run again.
ANDERTON: What --
AGATHA: RUN!
