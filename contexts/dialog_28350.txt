MARY: Get out.
TED: Wait, hold on, Mary -- it's not as bad as it sounds. I certainly didn't know --
MARY: That you put a murderer on my trail?
TED: Well yeah, I didn't know much about him. I just thought --
MARY: What did you think, Ted? That you could spy on me and trick me into thinking you were someone I could... really go for?
TED: Mary, I swear I wasn't trying to trick you.
MARY: Then what the fuck did you do it for?
TED: I did it because because I'd never stopped thinking about you and if I didn't find you I knew my life would never be good again.
MARY: Please leave.
TED: Mary, come on...
MARY: Go!
TED: Okay.
