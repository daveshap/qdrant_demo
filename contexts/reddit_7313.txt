How do I make sure I will succeed in my first big boy job?
Thanks to all your advices reddit, after 4 looong months of constant search and disappointment, I had finally received an offer from my dream job!

I had never had a full time job and pretty much have only had retail experience, so I am very nervous and truly want to perform well in my new job, especially since my boss had decided to match my salary expectation with a pretty significant increase because he says he sees the potential in me. 

I am super eager to learn and I really want to do well and not disappoint anybody. 

I want to hear some stories from you guys, how have you prepared for you success in your first 'real job' and make sure you are learning things at a good pace? I would also appreciate any tips!!
