CHRISTMAS: What the hell were you doing? You nearly killed us!
BOND: I did kill us. She thinks we’re dead. And she thinks she got away with it.
CHRISTMAS: What the hell are you talking about?
BOND: It’s part of some plan. She dresses it up like a terrorist attack. The explosion covers up the theft of the plutonium.
CHRISTMAS: Who’s she?
BOND: Elektra King.
CHRISTMAS: Elektra King? Are you insane? This is her pipeline.
BOND: Makes her look even more innocent.
CHRISTMAS: What would she want with weapons grade plutonium?
BOND: I was hoping you could tell me.
