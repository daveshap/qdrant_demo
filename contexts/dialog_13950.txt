MILES: Do you have a hard heart, Marylin.
MARYLIN: Did you see the tape?
MILES: Not yet.
MARYLIN: See the tape. Then we can discuss my heart.
MARYLIN: Tell me Mr. Massey. What was your performance about this afternoon?
MILES: What does your lawyer think?
MARYLIN: Ruth says you've been too successful, that you're bored, complacent, and you're on your way down.
MILES: But you don't agree?
MARYLIN: How do you know?
MILES: Why would you be here?
MARYLIN: I told you. I was hungry.
MILES: I'll have the tournedos of beef. And the lady will have the same? I assume you're a carnivore.
MARYLIN: I know you do.
