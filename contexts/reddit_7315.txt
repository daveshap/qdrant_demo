New employee - 2 weeks in, training is going too slow. How do I ask for more work/training?
I get the feeling my boss/coworkers don't have the skills to train anyone.

I work in an office job.  One of my core responsibilities will be paperwork.  I'm 2 weeks in and they haven't started "teaching" me about the paperwork that is so easy it's self-explanatory, and instead have me doing almost nothing.  I'm over 30, speak 3 languages, have a degree, and years of experience in another professional field so it's not like I'm slow.

I want to do the paperwork, and asked the guy who is supposed to train me if I could get a copy of some old data to practice filling out paperwork.  He didn't, so I asked him again later, and asked the head of our entire branch before we went home.

This job pays better than any job I've had before, by a significant amount.  I like the staff, and the job has the potential to be interesting, but they're going at a snail's pace.
