HANA: Are you asleep?
THE PATIENT: Yes. Dropping off.
MADOX: What did you think you were doing in his tent?
ALMÁSY: Looking for the fossils. Why should we wait until we're in London? This girl was probably twelve years old.
MADOX: You shouldn't go into another man's tent. It's inexcusable.
ALMÁSY: Her hands and feet were tied.
MADOX: What did you do?
ALMÁSY: I looked at them. They're shrubs, small trees. Exquisite. And fossilized, rock hard. He walks away to the nose of the plane.
MADOX: I was talking about the girl.
ALMÁSY: Cut the ropes. I left a note, on his blanket. At the next Geographical Society I shall await with great interest the announcement of the Fenelon-Barnes Slave Knot. The Girl wouldn't leave, of course. Her father had sold her for a camel. He turns over the propeller, the engine cranks up.
HANA: I should try and move your bed. I want you to be able to see the view. It's good, it's a view from a monastery.
THE PATIENT: I can already see.
HANA: How? How can you see anything?
THE PATIENT: Not the window - I can't bear the light anyway - no, I can see all the way to the desert. I've found the lost fossils.
HANA: I'm turning you.
THE PATIENT: Zerzura, the White City of Acacias, the Oasis of Little Birds. As me about the scent of acacia - it's in this room. I can smell it. The taste of tea so black it falls into your mouth. I can taste it. I'm chewing the mint. Is there sand in my eyes? Are you cleaning sand from my ears?
HANA: No sand. That's your drugs speaking.
THE PATIENT: I can see my wife in that view.
HANA: Are you remembering more?
THE PATIENT: Could I have a cigarette?
HANA: Are you crazy?
THE PATIENT: Why are you so determined to keep me alive?
HANA: Because I'm a nurse.
