The person who lives above me
Why must you stomp around your apartment all day? You walk as if you are in a marching band. The pictures on my wall shake. I use to hate the girl that lived above me a year ago, but you are much, much worse. You wake me up at 6am. I have complained to the apartment manager to no avail. I have knocked on your door at 630am, when it was unbearable, and you didn't answer.

I wish there was some way I could just get back at you for all the wake up calls I never requested. It feels great to complain to someone. At this point, I just want to do something equally as annoying - even if that is not the best way to handle this. I feel I have exhausted my options in handling this like an adult. Any suggestions?
