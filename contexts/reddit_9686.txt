Thinking about Leaving SA
I am thinking about leaving the Student Affairs profession.  I think my passion for it has dwindled.  Does anyone have any advice in a profession I would be able to make the transition to?  I have a Masters in Higher Education Administration.  Am I stuck working for a university/college forever?
