PANTUCCI: Don't shoot!! Don't shoot!!
FINNEGAN: Just the man I wanted to see. On this puppy here, you remember if it's red to blue or blue to red...
PANTUCCI: Not even a Joey, I'm glad to see you? Joey, what happened to your leg?
FINNEGAN: Joey, you want to get sucked out by a giant fucking mutated squid?
PANTUCCI: Red cross over to blue double blue ...is that what it is? A squid?
FINNEGAN: Squid...squid like...squid type... it's got tentacles, a feed sac... probably one central nervous processor somewhere...what the hell do I know is going on deep down in the ocean...there's all sorts of shit we've never seen...eighty foot clams...60 foot sharks...I'm just guessing...can you get me more juice out of Hercules...fast?
PANTUCCI: For juice, I gotta rebuild. That's not fast.
TRILLIAN: How about noise? Can you get noise? We don't need speed, just noise, right?
FINNEGAN: Right...
PANTUCCI: Can somebody tell me what the object of the exercise is here?
FINNEGAN: Seafood salad. You ever operate a jet ski?
TRILLIAN: You want ME to go up there?
FINNEGAN: Not unless you can wire a missle or fix an engine.
TRILLIAN: And what if I run into one of those things?
