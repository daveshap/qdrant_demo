Had a girl judge me for having one pic on Instagram
This girl I met on a dating website was hot. 9/10. She's talking a lot, lightning fast answers. Then she asks if I have Instagram. I told her I just made it, it's nothing to look at. A few minutes go by, no request accepted. Then she says "it's kind of scary because I don't know if you're real". 20 minutes go by. Then I say, "you know a Instagram doesn't prove that more than a dating app right"? "Yes, I know", she says. And that was it. Wtf? Do people really judge you based on fucking Instagram?

Edit: Wow, lots of opinions, and some strong ones. Some people seem to think I have a lack of concern for a girl's safety. Not so, at all. I can really see where this girl was coming from--at first I thought it was a question on whether or not she was shallow, but to her this probably was more about her validation of me "being a real person" i.e. not a catfish. And in that regard, yes, I did blow it. What my original butthurt-ness was about, was the immediate disqualification I got. But I know that no one on a dating app is under any obligation to keep talking.
