I was just elected to City Council tonight.
Hey all. I’m 26 years old (F) and decided to run for City Council in the spring of this year. After making it through the primary, I worked on my campaigning all myself. Made my flyer, bought the list of registered voters from the city, bought all postage, folded them, and mailed them all out.

Tonight is a win for all of us. It’s proof that we can get over these mental barriers from anxiety  if we let ourselves. It’s a hard fight, but tonight more than one battle was won.
