What are the jurisdictional relationships between the local police departments and many federal agencies in and around Washington, D.C.?
After [protesting](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/george-floyd-protest-white-house-president-trump-secret-service/) broke out around the White House recently, President Trump tweeted (in part): 

>On the bad side, the D.C. Mayor, @MurielBowser, who is always looking for money & help, wouldn't let the D.C. Police get involved. 'Not their job.'

Tweet quoted from the [same article](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/george-floyd-protest-white-house-president-trump-secret-service/) 

According to the District of Columbia Home Rule Act [here](http://www.abfa.com/ogc/tit7.htm#740), the President may, in emergency situations, direct the MPD to "provide...services of the Metropolitan Police force". I have not seen any discussion of such an emergency declaration being made on or around May 29, the night President Trump referred to in his tweet. And in a broader sense, how are jurisdictional issues between the local PDs and Federal Agencies (the Park Service, the Secret Service, etc.) resolved and navigated?
