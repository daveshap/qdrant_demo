GABRIEL: You got one hour.
RUDY: I'm gonna need some money.
RUDY: Ten dollars? What do I do with ten dollars?
GABRIEL: Don't tip.
RUDY: Monster. If we're working together here, we gotta be working together. I can't walk in there looking like the Lone Fucking Ranger with ten bucks to throw down. You don't want me getting noticed, right? Not getting noticed costs a guy at least a couple hundred.
