Should I start a website with the purpose of giving career advice to youth?
Hi everyone! I'm an alumnus from Dartmouth College working in product management in San Francisco. I have been giving high schoolers college interviews and helping recent graduates with finding jobs and general career advice.

I'm thinking of starting a website and volunteering some of my spare time to give career advice. I was wondering what the interest level would be for this kind of assistance. I thought this might be a good place to ask.

Would it be a good use of my time? Would anyone be interested in this?
