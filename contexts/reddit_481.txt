My mom is smoking behind my step-fathers back , saying she quit - he quit smoking for HER , successfully.
I need some solid advice.

About a year ago my mom landed in a hospital due to  health issues -  connected to smoking.

She told my Stepfather (Michael) that she was gonna quit smoking cigarettes once she was out - he agreed and said he was gonna quit too - since he runs marathons and it would improve his preformance.

A couple months later my stepfather is smoke-free with iron will , a nicotine spray and a LOT of sport.

He enthusiastically tells me about how much money he's saving , how he can breathe easier and his stamina has gone way up - he drops me off at home and zooms to work.

I go out to the balcony and catch my mother - lighter in hand - smoking.

This shit has been going on for about a year - I tried to talk to her about it , tell her that not only is she ruining her health but also her relationship.
She made promises to quit and failed each and every one of them.

Michael has no clue - they literally got married 3 months ago - I've tried my best to just keep my mouth shut but I know that its only a matter of time until she gets caught - and that will end in tragedy.

tl;dr: My mother is lying to my stepfather about quitting smoking - I am afraid this will completely wreck their marriage.
