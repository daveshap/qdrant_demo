What are the pros and cons of merit-based immigration?
The Trump Administration recently unveiled a [new merit-based immigration plan.](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/president-trumps-bold-immigration-plan-21st-century/)   It reshapes the immigration system and prioritizes people with high skills to get visas to legally enter the country.

It has had its proponents and critics alike.    [Nancy Pelosi has criticized it.](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nancy-pelosi-speaks-to-reporters-as-white-house-gears-up-for-latest-immigration-battle/)  CNN has called it ["likely doomed"](https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/16/politics/donald-trump-immigration-plan-announcement/index.html).   Some have said that it ["is a step in the right direction."](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/05/trumps-merit-based-immigration-proposal-makes-sense/589846/)

I was wondering what the pros and cons would be to such a system.   There are pundits on both sides, as always, but I would like to see what verifiable evidence there is to the pros and cons of such a system without all of the bias from both sides.
