Should I include a rotation on my CV if it resulted in a publication?
I'm currently wrapping up my first rotation of a Biomedical Sciences PhD program, and I've decided not to join this lab for my thesis. However, since this project was entirely computational (my typical research is more wet lab), it progressed very quickly and I'm now getting ready to write up a paper for a mid-tier journal. I will be either 1st or 2nd author.

My question is, should I include this rotation under the "research experience" section of my CV? The only thing I'll be using it for in the near future is applying for grants/fellowships. Obviously I'll include the paper on my CV once it's published, but would a description of the rotation be beneficial to include as well?
