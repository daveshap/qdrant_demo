CORKY: There is no going back.
VIOLET: When I get the Scotch, how do I know you won't take off?
CORKY: The same way I'll know that you went to Scotch. Trust.
VIOLET: I still don't see how I'm going to get clean with the money in the apartment. Everyone will think I did it.
CORKY: Not Caesar.
VIOLET: Why?
CORKY: Because of what you are going to tell him. You have to make it as real as you can. The moment you open the door with the Scotch in your hand, you will be covered, and that moment is the most important moment in the plan.
CORKY: If it's real enough, he'll believe it, because deep down he'll want to.
VIOLET: C! Shit, I'm sorry!
VIOLET: They were early.
CAESAR: What are you talking about?
VIOLET: They just left, didn't they?
CAESAR: What are you, drunk?
VIOLET: You mean they weren't up here?
CAESAR: No! They're still on their way.
VIOLET: That doesn't make any sense.
CAESAR: Why?
VIOLET: Because I just saw Johnnie downstairs.
CAESAR: What?
VIOLET: I was getting out of the car when I saw him in the Mercedes.
CAESAR: It couldn't have been.
VIOLET: It was him. I'm positive.
CAESAR: It's impossible!
VIOLET: Caesar, I know Johnnie. It was him. I screamed when I saw him. I couldn't believe I missed them. I knew you were going to be upset so I thought I'd apologize and give Gino the Scotch. I honked a couple of times but he didn't stop.
