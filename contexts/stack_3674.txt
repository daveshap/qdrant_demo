What is the expected maximum value of a gamma distribution, as a function of number of samples? I have the following situation. I have observations that fill out a gamma distribution. (At least they seem to: the distribution of values of several thousand observations looks to the eye like a gamma distribution. For the purposes of this question, let's assume they do.) I want to know what the largest value I can expect is, as a function of the number of observations I make, i.e. the expectation value of the extreme value. I know that the more observations I make, the larger the largest value is likely to be, but I don't know how much larger. E.g. if I make 10 observations, the largest value I see might be 1; if I make 100 observations, it might be 1.5, etc. But what if I were to imagine making a very large number (e.g. 1e10) observations? I am reasonably sure this question is related to extreme-value theory, but I have not been able to answer it through reading/searching.I did find a nice paper that showed that the expectation value of the max of a gaussian distribution is given by norm.ppf(0.5264**(1/n)), where n is the number of samples. I am looking for a similar expression for when the distribution is gamma, instead of gaussian. Thanks in advance for the help!
