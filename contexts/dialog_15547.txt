MOTHER: He had been sick from the time you began growing in me. We thought he would die.
LHAMO: Cow.
MOTHER: Yes. A cow had died. One night, you stopped all your moving, and I said to your sister, His time has come.""
LHAMO: Me. First break of day.
MOTHER: At dawn, you were born. One eye was closed, and your sister opened it with her thumb. We gave you the sweet drink.

LHAMO: I miss my brother.
MOTHER: I miss him too.
