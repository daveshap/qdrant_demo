Does write stalls on separated MDF file affect performance My user database MDF file resides on separated disk. There is nothing else on the disk than this MDF file. I can see average write stalls higher then 20ms on the file using appropriate DMV. I assume that writes are only made assynchroniously by checkpoints or lazy writer.I doubt whether there is any direct negative impact on the workload performance because of these write stalls? Or is there any good reason we should try to increase write performance of the disk?
