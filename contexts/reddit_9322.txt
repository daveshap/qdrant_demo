I paid off my credit card... but then I had to pay it off again.. and again.. and again
I’ve seen a lot of “Yay I paid off my debt” posts here and just wanted to add in my experience. 

Paying it off is a massive success - be proud of yourself, youve worked hard to get to this point! But the biggest challenge is actually breaking the habits that set you down that path in the first place. 

It took me years to pay off my credit card, then the balance grew and then it took me several months to pay off but then it grew again... It started with a few purchases that were over budget combined with an “I’ve got all this extra money now” attitude and then suddenly my balance was more than I could pay off with my pay check - it was a slippery slope back to square one. 

If you are working towards your goal, make sure you set new goals when you achieve them. Paying off debt is fantastic, but keep the momentum going and avoid the same pitfalls that may have brought you there in the first place.

I hope this helps someone out there and encourages those that might be in the same cycle I have been in! 

Disclaimer - Obviously this doesn’t apply to unforeseen  circumstances (one day maybe we will all have emergency funds) but rather the change in attitude of not being “poor” and having money again.
