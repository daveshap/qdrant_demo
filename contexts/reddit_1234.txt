Coronavirus Megathread

Hello, everyone. We understand that there is a lot of concern right now with the Coronavirus. We are seeing a very high number of posts related to the virus and many are being reported as spam. From this point forward, please direct all of your Coronavirus comments to this post. Others will be removed as we see them. 

A gentle reminder to keep the conversations helpful or supportive. Comments that incite more panic will be removed. 

We are including a link to the r/askscience [megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/etkdx1/coronavirus_megathread/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) as well for more helpful information.

Edit: Please refrain from posting symptoms or looking for medical advice. This is not a clinic and we are not doctors. Please reach out to your doctor if you have medical questions or questions about symptoms.

Edit II: Everyone is doing a really great job. It’s been fascinating and inspiring to see all the ways this community has been supporting each other and lifting each other up. There are people here from all over the world and it’s clear that a lot of our concerns are the same, no matter how different our situations are. I look forward to the day that we can look back on this thread and hold it up for ourselves to see how strong we all really are and how we are able to keep forging ahead, even when it feels like we’re not. Keep your chins up, everyone.

Edit III: Refrain from comparing one illness to another (eg - flu vs covid) as there are people here who are anxious about *any* illness.

Edit IV: We have temporarily established a discord chat for Covid-19. Please utilize that as you wish and remember our discord has voice as well. https://discordapp.com/invite/vF4DqMJ
