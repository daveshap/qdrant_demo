Humanities: how do you come up with original questions/paper topics?
Hi! I’m a masters student in religious ethics and I’m having so much trouble with paper topics. Basically, the feedback I got from every professor last semester is that my papers summarize the arguments from a scholar/philosopher/theologian well but I’m not actually writing anything interesting or new. I love grad school and I love learning. I love my field! But I’m feeling paralyzed when it comes to asserting my opinion or making original connections. I just don’t feel equipped with enough knowledge to do that yet. I know a lot of people say that but I’m scared I didn’t take enough foundational courses in undergrad. I really want to be a professor, but this is making me question my ability to be a true scholar. How do you come up with good questions in the humanities and move forward with confidence that you can write a ~20 page paper on it without summarizing someone else’s thoughts for >half of it? How do you write something original when you’re just doing a close reading/exegesis on a text?
