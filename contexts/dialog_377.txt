EDDIE: You know how my tapes sell. People eat this stuff up.
MALE VOICE: I had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month. Do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt, and try to fucking return it?
EDDIE: Maybe there's something wrong with the scumbag customers coming into your place, ever think of that?
MALE VOICE: The only thing wrong is the cheap, softcore crap you're peddling, Eddie. Where do you get this stuff?
EDDIE: Look, you cocksucker...
MALE VOICE: Get together some upscale product where the girls still have teeth in their head. Till then, fuck you.
EDDIE: Fuck you!
EDDIE: Celebrity Films.
WELLES: Eddie.
EDDIE: Yeah, who's this?
WELLES: I know what you did.
EDDIE: What?
WELLES: I know what you did.
EDDIE: Who is this.
WELLES: You murdered that girl, Eddie. Six years ago...
EDDIE: What the fuck are you.. ?
WELLES: You killed that girl and you put it on film. You and your pals, you're fucked. You fucked up real good.
