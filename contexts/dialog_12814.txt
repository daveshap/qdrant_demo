HILDY: A fine bunch of reporters. Biggest story in two years and they're too lazy to go after it.
ENDICOTT: It's easy for you to talk. You're retired. We're still working.
MCCUE: Okay. Forget it.
HILDY: What's the matter with you boys? Afraid it might rain? If you want to go, I'll cover this end.
MURPHY: Say, Hildy, if I know you, you sound pretty anxious to get rid of us. Are you trying to scoop us or something?
ENDICOTT: Something smells around here. If you ask me Mollie gave her the story on how Williams got that gun. Did you smuggle that gun into Williams, Mollie?
