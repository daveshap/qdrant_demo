RAE: Sorry.
LAZARUS: Looks like you know a song.
RAE: Don't know where I learn't it, but... it's there in my head.
LAZARUS: How you feelin' today?
RAE: You know how you feel when you come out of a bad hangover? Like your eyes can open a little bit more.
LAZARUS: I know that.
RAE: Woke up real early. Sun was shining. Just thought I'd mess around, try to learn a song.
LAZARUS: Go'on and sing it, I'll play.
RAE: No, you do it. I can't sing.
LAZARUS: Stop that foolishness. Just do as I say and close your eyes. Close your eyes. And think about... well, for a song like this, I'd say you think about what you love.
RAE: What I love.
LAZARUS: Get a good picture in your mind.
