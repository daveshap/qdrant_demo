Living with suicidal ideation is like having to put killing yourself on the bottom of your checklist for the day and hoping you don’t get everything done
Like, I (F23) WANT to live. I want to be happy and normal (and I know people are like “there is no normal, we all get sad!” But since puberty I have heard voices, pulled out my hair, self harmed, been generally anxious and extremely emotional, and always suicidal). But my therapists and psychiatrists and parents and friends just tell me to make a list. I get overwhelmed easily and my brain immediately goes to “just die”—but they say making a list helps. So I try, and I put it on the bottom of my list everyday. For example, tomorrow:

-breakfast&coffee
-homework
-shower 
-clean
-work
-homework
-commit suicide

And if I get tired at any time, I just go to sleep and start over again. But dying is always at the end of my list. Its worked for me so far. I’m a great procrastinator, so just putting it off until the next day helps me survive. 

I know sometimes it seems death is grabbing you by the nostrils and screaming in your face to just do it, but I’m talking about just day to day life.
