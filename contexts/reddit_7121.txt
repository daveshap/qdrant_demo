CEO sounds like he's mentally ill.
So i started a new job about 3 months ago with a startup that does sales for other tech companies. This isn't my field, so it's an entry level position with entry level pay. My boss said that health insurance is "coming" but haven't heard anything so far. We're about 20 employees. Anyways, last week my boss starts posting extremely bizarre shit on our skype account, saying that "we're all slaves" and to "set ourselves free" "You know this" and then says he has to go away for awhile, not sure when he'll be back. It's been a week and we're all wondering what the hell is going on. Anyways, the pay isn't great, i'm 28, and the commute is not the best to this job. Wondering if anyone has any advice on this situation. Our CEO seems like he's off his rocker though, legitimately sounds mentally ill.
