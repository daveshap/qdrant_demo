My family's pressuring me to get a job. How can I convince myself that it won't be so horrible?
I have some Pure-O OCD, anxiety and mild depression and I'm in a junior college now but don't care about my major and will drop out. How can I get into the mindset that working a crappy job will be good for me and that I'll have motivation to get out of bed every morning?
