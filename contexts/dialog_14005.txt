LINDA: Jimmy, calm down! What happened? Tell me what happened!
JIMMY: I got trapped in Mrs. McKeltch's van -- and she went to the tunnel and went down there with them -- behind my house. I saw them.
LINDA: Where, Jimmy?
JIMMY: Behind my house, up on the ridge.
LINDA: If we go and look and there's nothing there, you'll have to admit to me that this is all in your mind.
