Is the encryption passphrase presented on install required if I have a luks header backup? After installing Lubuntu 16.04 with LUKS full drive encryption and LVM I was presented with a long passphrase to record for recovery purposes. I'm assuming this is the \"true\" encryption key that my LUKS key / boot password unlocks. If so, do I need to record it if I am keeping a LUKS header backup on some removable media? I assume that with this passphrase all data could be recovered from the drive, even if the LUKS header was corrupted and no backup available. And that if this passphrase is leaked then all data would be up for grabs.Is this right?I just want to be sure I understand correctly what this passphrase is for and the risks / usefulness associated with it.
