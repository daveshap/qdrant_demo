NAPOLEON: As for the author... shoot him.
DELBENÈ: A word of caution, Sire: we all remember what happened to Robespierre, Danton and Marat. Put the Marquis to death, and history might even regard you as a despot.
NAPOLEON: But I am history.
DELBENÈ: Of course, Your Highness. Nevertheless... cure the Marquis de Sade... succeed, where countless physicians and priests have failed...
NAPOLEON: Yes?
DELBENÈ: No one can fault Napoleon for merely bringing a man to his senses.
