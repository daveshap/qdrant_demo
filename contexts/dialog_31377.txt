GRADY: Are you and Hannah seeing each other, James?
JAMES LEER: No! What gave you that idea?
GRADY: Relax, James. I'm not her father. I just rent her a room.
JAMES LEER: She likes old movies like I do, that's all. Besides, she doesn't really know me. She thinks she does, but she doesn't. Maybe it's because she's Mormon and I'm Catholic.
GRADY: Maybe it's because she's beautiful and she knows it and try as she might to not let that screw her up, it's inevitable that it will in some way.
JAMES LEER: You're not like my other teachers, Professor Tripp.
GRADY: You're not like my other students, James. So what was the movie you two saw?
JAMES LEER: Huh? Oh. Son of Fury. With Tyrone Power and Frances Farmer.
GRADY: She went crazy, Frances Farmer.
JAMES LEER: So did Gene Tierney. She's in it too.
GRADY: Sounds like a good one.
JAMES LEER: It's not bad.
GRADY: Listen, James, about this afternoon. In workshop. I'm sorry. I think I let things get a bit out of control.
JAMES LEER: They really hated it. I think they hated it more than any of the other ones.
GRADY: Well...
JAMES LEER: It doesn't matter. It only took me an hour to write.
GRADY: Really? That's remarkable.
JAMES LEER: I have trouble sleeping. While I'm lying in bed I figure them out. The stories.
GRADY: You cold, James?
JAMES LEER: A little.
GRADY: So what are you doing out here?
JAMES LEER: It's colder in there.
GRADY: You're right.
JAMES LEER: Actually, I saw the greenhouse. So I thought... I thought I'd come out here and take a look at it. You don't see one of those every day. It looks like heaven...
GRADY: Heaven?
JAMES LEER: I saw a movie once. Part of it took place in heaven. Everyone wore white and lived in crystal houses. Like that. At least that's the way I remember it...
