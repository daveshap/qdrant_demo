JOANNA: Ted, when we got married it was because I was twenty-seven years old and I thought I should get married and...when I had Billy it was because I thought I should have a baby...and I guess all I did was mess up my life and your life and--
TED: Joanna, what the hell is--
JOANNA: Please...Please don't stop me. This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do..
JOANNA: After I left...when I was in California, I began to think, what kind of mother was I that I could walk out on my own child. It got to where I couldn't tell anybody about Billy--I couldn't stand that look in their faces when I said he wasn't living with me. Finally it seemed like the most important thing in the world to come back here and prove to Billy and to me and to the world how much I loved him...And I did ...And I won. Only...it was just another should." ...Sitting in that courtroom. Hearing everything you did
TED: What?
JOANNA: He's already got one mother, he doesn't need two...He's yours... I won't fight you for him any more. He's yours...
TED: Oh, God...Oh, my God...
JOANNA: Only can I still see him?
TED: No more waiting in Coffee Shops ...I promise.
JOANNA: Okay...I think I'll go talk to my son now. How do I look?
TED: Beautiful.
