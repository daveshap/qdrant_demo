Are there any Carthaginian ruins in Libya? Libya is known for some beautiful and well-preserved Ancient Roman ruins.  Before it belonged to Rome, the territory of modern-day Libya was part of the Carthaginian Empire.  Do there exist any monumental or architectural ruins from the Carthaginian era that can be visited by tourists?I'm aware that it's generally not considered safe to visit Libya at the moment.  Consider this question to be long-term planning for a future visit once the political situation has stabilized.  If any Carthaginian sites were open to tourists during the Gadaffi era, and are not known to have been destroyed since then, please tell me about them.
