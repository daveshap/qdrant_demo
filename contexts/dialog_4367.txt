JEREMIAH: What the hell do you want?
LUPOVICH: Just a visit with my old pal, Jay-bird.
JEREMIAH: Don't call me that.
LUPOVICH: You certainly traded up. ...the trophy wife. Nice lookin'.
JEREMIAH: Keep your hands to yourself, willya?
LUPOVICH: I been watching you. You done good. Invested wisely. Respectable businessman now. Just like you always wanted.
JEREMIAH: And you? Still a pig. Just a much fatter one.
LUPOVICH: No reason to get nasty. Yeah, I've stayed in the organization. But then again I never got the percentage you did.
JEREMIAH: Or you didn't know what to do with it.
LUPOVICH: Maybe so. Maybe so. But that ain't why I came to see you. You sold the building.
JEREMIAH: What building?
LUPOVICH: Don't shit a shitter. Our building. What did you call it? His 'tomb'? We had an agreement. You were supposed to sit on it. Not sell it --
JEREMIAH: I didn't sell it.
LUPOVICH: Well, somebody bought it. That's what I heard.
