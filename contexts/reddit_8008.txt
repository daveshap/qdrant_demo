How did you go about applying for student loans and what's a good interest rate?
 I'm planning on attending graduate school in Europe and will not receive much financial aid at all. Im looking at different options to pay for graduate school and am thinking that a student loan would be the best way to pay for it. 

How did you find your student loan provider? Im scared about student debt and dont want to be paying a large amount of money through interest. What's a good interest rate range?
