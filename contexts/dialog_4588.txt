CAESAR: You can't leave.
VIOLET: The hell I can't!
CAESAR: I need you ...
VIOLET: Bullshit! You don't need me! You've never needed me! I can't help you! Understand?! I have to get out.
CAESAR: Violet, I won't let you leave.
CAESAR: If you're not with me, Violet, then I have to assume you're against me.
VIOLET: Caesar, this is crazy.
CAESAR: Maybe it is, maybe it isn't. Maybe you dropped the Scotch by accident. Maybe you didn't.
CAESAR: It would have been so easy to let him in as you went out.
VIOLET: You don't, you can't believe that ...
CAESAR: I've seen the way he looks at you. He's always wanted you. Maybe two million dollars finally bought you.
