KIRK: On screen.
UHURA: Admiral --
KIRK: Do it, while we have time.
KIRK: Khan!
SAAVIK: Who?
KHAN: You still remember, Admiral. I cannot help but be touched. Of course, I remember you.
KIRK: What is the meaning of this attack? Where is the crew of the Reliant?
KHAN: Surely I have made my meaning plain. I mean to avenge myself upon you, Admiral. I've deprived your ship of power and when I swing round I mean to deprive you of your life --
KHAN: -- But I wanted you to know first who it was who had beaten you: I, Khan Noonian Singh, the eagle you attempted to cage forever.
KIRK: Khan, listen to me -- if its me you want, I'll have myself beamed aboard. All I ask is that you spare my crew.
KHAN: That is a most intriguing offer. Typical, I must say of your sterling character. Let me think.
