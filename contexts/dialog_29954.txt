GRACE: I thought you would be on your way to Vegas by now. Is there something you wanted?
JOHN: I wanted to talk.
GRACE: I don't think we have anything to talk about.
JOHN: What about us?
GRACE: There is no us, remember?
JOHN: Except I can't get you out of my head, Grace.
JOHN: I've thought about you every second since I left. I can still taste you on my lips.
GRACE: Stop it.
JOHN: Why? Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
GRACE: Because I know you're full of shit.
JOHN: I mean it, Grace. I'm getting out of here, and I want to take you with me.
GRACE: I thought you couldn't leave. I thought you couldn't get your car.
JOHN: I could if I had Jake's money.
GRACE: Is that what changed your mind? The money?
JOHN: I don't give a damn about the money. I want you, and I want to get us out of this shithole. There's only one way to do that.
GRACE: Are you sure? About me, I mean?
JOHN: I came back for you; this morning I came back. Before I even knew about the money. You're what I want.
JOHN: The only reason I stormed off is because you sort of spooked me talking about Jake. But I've had nothing but time to think about it. It keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here. But we've got to get the money, baby. We get the money, I get the car, then we get the hell out.
GRACE: You said you couldn't kill anybody.
JOHN: We don't have to kill him. Just knock him out and tie him up 'till we get away.
