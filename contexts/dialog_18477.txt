BABE: There you are. Grant's Tomb. I hope you're not disappointed.
LONGFELLOW: It's wonderful.
BABE: To most people, it's an awful letdown.
LONGFELLOW: Huh?
BABE: I say, to most people it's a washout.
LONGFELLOW: That depends on what they see.
BABE: Now, what do you see?
LONGFELLOW: Me? Oh, I see a small Ohio farm boy becoming a great soldier. I see thousands of marching men. I see General Lee with a broken heart, surrendering, and I can see the beginning of a new nation, like Abraham Lincoln said. And I can see that Ohio boy being inaugurated as Presidentâ€” Things like that can only happen in a country like America.
