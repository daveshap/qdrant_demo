BARNEY: I asked you how you like your coffee...? We have black and bitter. As the Soul of Man. Or light and sweet, as the world- view of the self-delusive.
STARLING: We got a bunch of <u>materials</u>, coming up at auction. Materials which disappeared from Dr. Lechter's cell, drawings he made, his <u>books</u>.
BARNEY: Yes?
STARLING: And I'd like your help, determining who's bidding for their purchase.
BARNEY: Why me?
STARLING: Waal, because your <u>selling</u>'em... Two years ago, his annotated Dictionary of Cuisine, by Alexander Dumas, went for sixteen thousand dollars. Seller's affidavit of ownership, signed Cary Panz. P.A.N.Z. Sounds to me like an Orderly. Whadja clear on the book? Ten, twelve grand?
BARNEY: ...very good.
STARLING: Here's what they want you to do: we want the rest of the stuff you stole from his cell.
BARNEY: ...why?
STARLING: Let's just say they got a passion for collectibles...
BARNEY: You said here's what <u>they</u> want you to do..." Why?"
STARLING: Now, whyn't you help us?
BARNEY: That would adversely impact my income.
STARLING: Not as much as being jailed for theft of Government Property, or for failure to pay income tax, on undisclosed income.
BARNEY: We could skip the Gavotte.
STARLING: Say it in English.
BARNEY: Lechter's not buying up his Memorabilia. He keeps it all in his mind
STARLING: Then who's buying it?
BARNEY: There's one or two freaks, and, for a <u>Pass</u>
STARLING: <u>That's</u> the spirit...
BARNEY: ...aren't you afraid of me...?
STARLING: You want me to be?
BARNEY: I'd prefer it... But it's just a vacant exercise.
