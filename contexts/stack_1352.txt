How should I build a garden fence on the edge of a swamp? I'm currently building approximately a 60' X 100' garden on the edge of a swamp (1-2 feet above the water table), and am wondering what to build the fence out of, and how to build it as this is also my wild mushroom garden, and the mushrooms will attack the poles.
