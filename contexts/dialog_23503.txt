WILL: Can you love a fool?
VIOLA: Can you love a player?
WILL: Wait! You are still a maid and perhaps as mistook in me as I was mistook in Thomas Kent.
VIOLA: Answer me only this: are you the author of the plays of William Shakespeare?
WILL: I am.
VIOLA: Then kiss me again for I am not mistook.
VIOLA: I do not know how to undress a man.
WILL: It is strange to me, too.
