Book identification: 1990s children's book with robot and credit card I'm UK-based, and recall reading and loving a book series in the 1990s about:a young male character, and to a lesser extent his familywho had a robot companion (who I think was referenced in the title)who had access to a debit/credit card called a \"Junior Credit ID\"There was definitely a futuristic vibe about them, too.The books are long since gone from my parents' house, and no-one can remember the title or any character names, but apparently one of my homemade \"Junior Credit ID\" cards has survived.All help gratefully received!Edit to answer comment questions:I\u2019m not 100%, but I seem to remember reading at least two separate books, since I was excited when I found \u201cthe next one\u201d at the library.YA rather than pure children\u2019s. I didn\u2019t feel condescended to as an eleven/twelve year-old, and had more adult concepts - that\u2019s probably why the Junior Credit ID still stands out in my memory. It wasn\u2019t a picture book. There may have been chapter illustrations, but I\u2019m not certain. For some reason I think the cover illustration was quite cartoony in nature, and I think the robot might have been yellow/gold. It\u2019s occurred to me the robot may have had a human name, but as an acronym. Again, I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s my memory playing tricks!
