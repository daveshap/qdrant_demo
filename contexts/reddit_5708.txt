Jobs in small cities in England.(Hull)
I just moved to small city and I was a little surprised that I didn't get a single interview.

I'm 18 all GCSE done graduated college worked for a year in sales and moved to this city in England. Well all is good except it's after new years, bad timing on my side. I visited all the shops, shopping centres etc and not a single offer.only thing was go online do it on website, only part time in 2-5 months for weekends.

I constantly apply online for anything that pops out, everytime I get a reply which is quite rare it says you didn't pass to next section.

Any advice? literally I'm applying to everything except factory work however that might soon change.

TLDR
Can't get a job in small city for minimum wage.
