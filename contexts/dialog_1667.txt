PANES: She's even better looking in the flesh.
SALLY: Really? I need a drink. Come hide with me.
SALLY: Oh, Jesus, Panes. I can't, I can't believe that bitch is in my house.
PANES: You don't know she's a bitch.
SALLY: She's all over him, are you blind?
PANES: It could be worse.
SALLY: How?
PANES: She could be playing the role in Joe's movie that should be yours.
SALLY: Fuck you, Panes.
PANES: You see, that's worse.
SALLY: I just wanted tonight to be with the people we love.
PANES: Like your business managers?
SALLY: They're not just our business managers, Panes.
PANES: Oh, okay, forgive me. Your neighbors are here, for fuck's sake.
SALLY: Exactly what I mean. It's all ruined.
PANES: It's not ruined, for fuck's sake. It's one of your parties.
SALLY: I don't want it to be just one of our parties.
PANES: How are you really doing
SALLY: Like the last time.
PANES: No. No, not like the last time. She was the rest of my life.
SALLY: Like the last time.
PANES: I wasn't finished.
SALLY: Okay.
PANES: We can't stand seeing you like this
SALLY: It's our anniversary, Panes.
PANES: I didn't hear me say tonight.
SALLY: We're just feeling our way back.
PANES: Otherwise
SALLY: You know it's true.
SKYE: Oh my God, sorry. I'm interrupting.
SALLY: I'll be right out.
PANES: Come on in.
SKYE: I'm in the same room with Sally Nash. Oh my God. You're my icon. I've been watching your films since I was a little girl. Like, four years ago I followed you all around the Beverly Center - at least half a day, working up the courage to introduce myself.
SALLY: I don't think I ever spent half a day in the Beverly Center.
SKYE: Whatever, do you remember? I've seen all your movies. When I was in rehab, the second time, they wouldn't even let us see your drug addict movie. They said you were too real. I worship you. And I couldn't be more flattered, because I know the part I'm playing in Joe's movie is based on you as a young woman.
SKYE: And I'm overwhelmed. And I want to do it justice. And I hope we can spend time together. And I'm gushing. It's my worst quality.
PANES: Not at all.
SKYE: Oh my god. I've been so rude. I'm Skye Davidson. Has anyone ever told you, you look like Peter Sellers?
PANES: No, never.
SALLY: Everyday.
PANES: I'm Levi Panes. Will you excuse us, Skye? It's time for Sally's meds.
