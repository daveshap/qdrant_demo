RAY: Why d'you wanna leave all this?
ABBY: You kidding? I don't wanna leave all this, I just wanna leave Marty...
ABBY: ...Drive me to a motel?
RAY: You can stay at my place, I'll drop you there.
ABBY: Where... where you going?
RAY: See a guy.
ABBY: Don't go to the bar, Ray. I know him, that ain't a good idea.
RAY: I just gotta see a guy.
MEURICE: Howdy stranger.
RAY: Meurice. Sorry I didn't show last night.
MEURICE: Wasn't too busy. You missed a good one, though. This white guy walks in about one o'clock, asks if we have a discount for alcoholics... I tell him to get lost, but Marty's sitting here listening and I can tell he's thinking that maybe it ain't such a bad idea...
