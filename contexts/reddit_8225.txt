META: On the Meaning of "Neutral"
With the American election season heating up, NeutralPolitics has seen continual growth. As posts and comments have come flooding in, mods have noticed an increasing number of user reports with just two words: "not neutral".

We appreciate reports on posts that don't meet our [guidelines'](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines) requirement to be "framed in a neutral way," but it's important to understand that comments have no neutrality requirement.

In 2011, NeutralPolitics was founded with the goal of creating a space for logical, respectful and evidence-based political discussion. Our [Original FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/pteu5/meta_rneutralpolitics_frequently_asked_questions/) spells out how neutrality plays into that:
>**Is this a subreddit for people who are politically neutral?**

>No - in fact we welcome and encourage any viewpoint to engage in discussion. The idea behind r/NeutralPolitics is to set up a neutral space where those of differing opinions can come together and rationally lay our respective arguments. **We are neutral in that no political opinion is favored here - only facts and logic.** Your post or comment will be judged not by its perspective, but by its style, rationale, and informational content.

So, it's the environment that's neutral, not the comments themselves.

**Here's how some of our mods have put it:**

* /u/cassisback: "Neutral means evidence based positions, and willingness to discard current positions in light of new evidence."

* /u/lolmonger: "I tend to think of "Neutral" as meaning a position that has some kind of logical grounding and is communicated along with how the conclusion was made and acknowledges it isn't the final word, necessarily, and is open to new information changing it."

* /u/lulfas: "Perspective, sources, facts. I had a professor that said 'if you can't argue both sides of a topic, you don't know enough about it to speak in public'. I attempt to live that on NeutralPolitics."

* /u/PavementBlues: "The phrase that I use to briefly describe a neutral approach is that it is one in which we seek to find out whether our opinions are correct rather than prove that they are correct."

Additionally, both the mod team and the userbase [have had discussions](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/15d8fc/is_neutral_the_same_as_moderate/) on whether "neutral means moderate" and the answer has been a resounding "no".

We don't advocate for a "moderate" or "centrist" perspective. You can be a progressive, a monarchist, an anarcho-liberal, a Burkean, a syndicalist or a classical reactionary. **As long as you're willing to have a polite, good-faith, evidence-based discussion with the other users and are open to new viewpoints in light of new evidence**, we're glad to have you here.
