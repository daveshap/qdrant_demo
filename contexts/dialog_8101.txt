MERRICK: Mr. Treves! Treves.
TREVES: John.... how can you ever forgive me?
KENDAL: It's all arranged. I'll send over some evening gowns for the sisters that you select to accompany Mr. Merrick. You'll be using the Royal entrance and Princess Alexandra herself will be there to welcome him to her private box.
TREVES: I'm very grateful to you, Mrs. Kendal. This is just the thing to help him forget his ordeal. John will be very excited.
KENDAL: Well it is a miracle he ever got back. And, I'm sure, Mr. Treves, under your expert care, he'll have many happy years ahead.
TREVES: I fear not, Mrs. Kendal. Even in the short time he was gone the size of his head has increased rapidly... as is his pain.
KENDAL: How awful for John.
TREVES: And yet, not once have any of us heard him complain.
KENDAL: Is he... dying then?
TREVES: Yes. There is nothing more frustrating, nothing that makes a physician feel more useless, than standing by watching his patient deteriorate. And when that patient is a friend, no... no, there's absolutely nothing I can do.
KENDAL: Well, it's all quite... I've never heard... It's quite...
TREVES: Yes.
