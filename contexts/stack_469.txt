Keyboard switched to Arabic Hello I am very concerned. I was just typing characters into google and my computer lagged a little bit and changed to arabic for a solid minute. I was trying to figure out what keys I pressed to cause this or it just happened on its own. After that minute the computer lagged and it switched back to english. Is there some computer shortcut that does this language switching or should I be concerned that someone out there is monitoring my use of this computer? FYI, I have a thnkpad t410 and on Ubuntu 16.04 loving it :).
