BARBATUS: Z! Over here!
Z: Barbatus?
Z: Barbatus!
BARBATUS: Be honest, kid -- am I hurt bad?
Z: No, no, you're...lookin' good. You've got good color in your cheeks.
BARBATUS: No -- I can see it in your eyes. I'm a goner. It's alright, Z. In this ant's army, a soldier's life ain't worth a sack of fungus. I can't feel my legs...
Z: Hang in there, buddy! You can make it! Just -- take deep breaths, I'll try and find your body -- it's gotta be around here somewhere!
BARBATUS: I wonder...what...was it all...for...
Z: Barbatus, hang on -- Barbatus!!
BARBATUS: Don't make my mistake, kid... don't...be a grunt...your whole life...
AZTECA: Hey, slow it down, big boy. You're making the rest of us look bad...How come I haven't seen you around here before?
WEAVER: I'm new...I was born yesterday.
AZTECA: Tell me about it.
WEAVER: Nobody told me digging was so much fun! You pick up the dirt, you move it, you pick it up again, you move it again -- lots of repetitions, you exercise the forceps, and the pincers --
AZTECA: Mmm, yes, I see what you mean...
