I woke up at 5 am and got broken up with
I doubt anyone will see this because it’s almost 6 by this point, and I’m sorry if this breaks the subreddits rules, but I just needed to vent.

I’ve been dating this girl for two months now, and everything was going really well. On Thursday I helped her pack her car to get home, and we promised that we would try and see each other over break. The town that we go to school at is halfway between where we each live, so it was definitely in the realm of possibility.

We had been texting since break started and talked on the phone Sunday night when she got home from work. I woke up late yesterday (around 11) and sent her a good morning text. She didn’t text me back because she had work, and had been busy all through the weekend, and I didn’t think much of it. Eventually it got to be evening with no reply, and then almost midnight, so I sent her another text saying goodnight and went to bed.

I woke up at 5am to find a text about how even though she liked me, and that we had talked about our relationship, that she wanted to break things off, and wanted more ‘autonomy,’ and that she’s ‘just not feeling it’. I honestly don’t know what to feel. I thought things were going great, but obviously they weren’t, and now I’m lying in bed typing this up wide awake.
