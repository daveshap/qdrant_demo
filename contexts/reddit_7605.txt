What Experience Would Have Helped in Grad School?
So I have about 8 months left of my gap year before entering a PhD program focused on genomics and evolutionary biology. What kind of experience or skill do any of you wish you had before beginning graduate school, or what would have helped things run smoother?

Thanks guys!
