Hourly Resident Directors & Labor Laws
Hello!

(These are USA specific questions since they involve labor laws but happy to hear from a broader range of inputs as well)

A few questions surrounding this.

1. Is anyone else doing hourly (FT) Resident Directors?
2. If so, how have you navigated providing Res. Life coverage / services over extended breaks where time-off is required like Winter, Summer, etc?
3. If your University is not using hourly Resident Directors, are they including the value of campus housing and other benefits to meet minimum FLSA salary requirements?
