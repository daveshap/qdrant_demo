PAULINE: My name is Gina!
HONORA: It's a letter from the school . . . from Miss Stewart.
PAULINE: What does old Stew want?
HONORA: She says the standard of your work is slipping. At this rate she doesn't think you'll get School Certificate.
PAULINE: Who cares!
HONORA: I care . . . your father cares . . . we want you to have a good education.
PAULINE: I'm educating myself!
HONORA: You're failing English . . . you used to be top of the class- PAULINE I'm doing my own writing!
HONORA: snatches up an exercise book from a large pile.
HONORA: These stories are not going to get you School Certificate! You don't seriously think anyone's going to publish them?
PAULINE: What do you know? You wouldn't know the first thing about writing. You're the most ignorant person I've ever met!
HONORA: is very angry.
HONORA: You're rude . . . rude and insolent! I don't see why I should keep a horrid child like you at school a minute longer.
PAULINE: I don't wanna be in bloody school!
HONORA: All right! You go out there and get a job and you damn well pay your own way!
