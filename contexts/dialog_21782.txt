VICKIE: What's the matter with you?
JAKE: Tryin' to get this fuckin' TV to work. Paid all this money for it and still can't get a station a mile away. And Mr. Wizard here ain't no help.
JOEY: Screw you, Jack.
JAKE: Where you been?
VICKIE: I went out.
JAKE: What's that kissing on the mouth shit?
JOEY: What? I just said hello. Since when I can't kiss my sister-in-law?
JAKE: Ain't a cheek ever good enough for you? I never even kissed Mama on the mouth.
JOEY: Well, you're not supposed to kiss your mother on the mouth.
JAKE: Well, that's what I mean.
JAKE: How's that?
JOEY: I can't tell. You're stomach's in the way.
