Headhunter Etiquette
I was contacted by a headhunter on LinkedIn. We've been working together for a week and it's going well - one interview and one phone screen so far, both with companies where the work is right up my alley.

Meanwhile, my former boss emails me today and says he's been singing my praises to the headhunter that helped him with his search for an executive role. Apparently that headhunter really wants to talk to me.

Is there etiquette on this? If you work with one headhunter while talking to another is it like cheating on your spouse? Or is it more like I can do what I want since it's my job search?

TL;DR Is it wrong to work with two headhunters at the same time?
