FREDDY: But they told me it was Ee gor.
IGOR: Well, they were wrong then, weren't they?
FREDDY: You were sent by Herr Falkstein, weren't you?
IGOR: Yes, that's right. My grandfather and your grandfather used to pal around together. You and I should have a lot of laughs.
FREDDY: I'm sure we will.
IGOR: This is Inga. They thought you might need an assistant temporarily.
