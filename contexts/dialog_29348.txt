WOODY: Oh, no...it's a Combat Carl.
SID: Just stay where you are, Corporal! Don't move, Carl. You'll blow up. I know you're tired! I know your leg is cramping, but you can't move. Do you hear me?
BUZZ: What's going on?
WOODY: Nothing that concerns you spacemen. Just us TOYS.
BUZZ: I'd better take a look anyway.
BUZZ: Why is that soldier strapped to an explosive device?
WOODY: That's why. Sid.
BUZZ: Sure is a hairy fellah.
WOODY: No! No, that's Scud, you idiot!
WOODY: THAT is Sid!
BUZZ: You mean that happy child?
MR. POTATO HEAD: That ain't no happy child.
REX: He tortures toys -- just for fun.
