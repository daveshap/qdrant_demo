JAKE: What are you talking about? Ten's standard.
ROTTOVICH: Yeah Well, Sobo's kid needs braces.
SOBOZINSKI: Do you have any idea what those monks charge for that medieval torture?
JAKE: We got a good thing going here. You want to blow it over an overbite?

JAKE: All the shit we pulled with you and you're trying to shake us down? You guys got sack.
ROTTOVICH: Was that a threat? Did I hear a threat? Last I remember, we were talking economics, then this...? What happens next time if we gotta stop and help a little old lady cross the street? Well, shit... Then we gotta pass the call to someone else.
