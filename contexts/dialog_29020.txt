MCKINNEY: Nice girl, that-- I'd hate to see <U>her</U> get a raw deal. You know, the great trouble with crooks is they're <U>too</U> smart. Now if I'd taken that bracelet, I'd find some way to slip it back--I'd know I could never get ashore with it.
BRETT: Anybody that's taken the trouble to get it would be a mug to put it back.
LOTHER: Could I see you a minute?
BRETT: Sure! Excuse me.
MCKINNEY: Congratulations.
SALLY: Exciting, wasn't it? Where's Jimmy?
MCKINNEY: He'll be back. What would you do if anybody gave you a bracelet?
SALLY: Say, Thanks very much!""
MCKINNEY: I mean if you knew it were stolen.
SALLY: Well, of course, I wouldn't take it.
MCKINNEY: And if you liked the person, you'd naturally persuade him to give it back and go straight, wouldn't you?
SALLY: Sure I would--but I don't get what you're driving at.
MCKINNEY: Maybe you will after you've thought it over.
