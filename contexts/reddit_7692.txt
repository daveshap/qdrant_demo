Master's in Curriculum & Instruction to teach College-level English?
Hey all! I'm looking at applying for adjunct teaching positions at my local community college in the English department over the next few years, but without a Master's degree, I know my chances of landing a decent position are fairly low. With that said, I'm in a place where I can get a Master's in Curriculum & Instruction in less than a year for very little money. Do you all think that degree would help my resume, even though it's not in the English field?

Thanks for your help!
