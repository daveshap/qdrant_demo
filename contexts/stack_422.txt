Ubuntu slow on old laptop with some non working keys I put ubuntu 17.04 on an old laptop that i want to donate to somebody as windows was already slow on itlaptop was very slow after installing ubuntu especially the animations so i disabled them all. still its a little less than usablei have my backspace key and underscore/hyphen key not working (this is the primary question) and i want to know how do i remap them to pausebreak and insert keys (since i can't know their key codes what should i do?)also can i disable some more features so as to make it a bit more usable or should i consider lubuntu
