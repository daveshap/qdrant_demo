CYNTHIA: Honey, some of this is... farfetched. You take after me. People skills and common sense. Good dependable qualities.
LANDON: I could take after Dad, too.
CYNTHIA: You do. You're handsome and charming.
LANDON: I meant he's a doctor.
CYNTHIA: That's eight years of school and training -- after college. And all that doesn't necessarily make you a better human being.
LANDON: I could do it if I tried. Even Kelly thinks so.
CYNTHIA: That'd be something.
CYNTHIA: But if it doesn't happen, grab for something within reach. Life's tough enough without causing yourself disappointment --
LANDON: Whatever my life is, I'm going to be friggin' sure I'm never disappointed --
CYNTHIA: Have I told you how proud I am of you -- ?
LANDON: Mom, great. But what I want is for me to be proud of me.
REV. SULLIVAN: Landon. You're not the quiet type.
LANDON: No.
REV. SULLIVAN: So talk to us about something.
LANDON: Like what, sir?
REV. SULLIVAN: You decide.
REV. SULLIVAN: How about your family?
LANDON: Okay. Sure. My grandfather. When he was seven, he shook the hand of an old guy, a war vet or something, who had once shaken President Lincoln's hand. Made a big impression on him.
LANDON: We didn't tell him any different for years --
REV. SULLIVAN: Your parents are divorced?
LANDON: Since I was five. My mom's a cocktail waitress.
REV. SULLIVAN: How do you -- the two of you -- get by?
LANDON: Materially or spiritually?
REV. SULLIVAN: Either. Both.
