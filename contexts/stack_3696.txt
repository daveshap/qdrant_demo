Is this feature extraction? I have a data set consisting of a large number of univariate time series.  I have empirical reasons to expect that each time series can be well described by a function with a small number of parameters, but the parameters can vary across time series.I have no theoretical reason to prefer any particular parameterization of the function.  I'm concerned that choosing a parameterization myself could result in bias in the subsequent analysis.  I'm wondering if it is possible to extract or visualize an appropriate \"shape\" or \"type\" of function directly from the data.  One of the features I expect to differ across time series is essentially a delay, so that the time series all have similar shapes but different temporal offsets and amplitudes.This seems like a feature extraction problem in dimensionality reduction - am I on the right track?  I'm not sure how something like kernel PCA would deal with the delay aspect.  Can anyone recommend good references?
