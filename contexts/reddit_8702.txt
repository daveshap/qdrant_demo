What are the pros and cons of nationalising the U.S. Defense Industry?
Recently, I've read this [post by John Stanton](https://www.counterpunch.org/2006/07/06/nationalize-the-defense-industry/) where he's arguing that the U.S. Defense Industry should be nationalised. In which, he discusses what he sees as issues with how the military and defence works, and how nationalising would help solve these problems. 

Some context:

Dwight D. Eisenhower warned Americans of a [Military Industrial Complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military%E2%80%93industrial_complex) - which is "an alliance between military officers and corporations that supply the military that does not serve the public interest."

Some groups have pushed in favour of further use of private military contractors. Well known Conservative thinktanks have called for [higher levels of privatization on military maintanence](https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/privatizing-military-maintenance), while others, including Jared Kushner, have also called for [hirings of so-called "private armies", such as Blackwater](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-michaels-privatization-military-20170720-story.html) for deployment abroad. 



U.S. military spending has continued to [increase](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2019/04/18/us-military-spending-set-increase-fifth-consecutive-year-nearing-levels-during-height-iraq-war/), meanwhile the top 100 companies around the world with military contracts, such as [Boeing and Raytheon,](https://www.businessinsider.com/the-top-9-biggest-defense-contractors-in-america-2016-5?r=US&IR=T#3-raytheon-company-3)  saw [$389 billion in total arms sales in 2018](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/02/21/military-spending-defense-contractors-profiting-from-war-weapons-sales/39092315/). President Trump has been [warm to large military budgets](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/03/10/pentagon-eyes-windfall-as-trump-seeks-750-billion-defense-budget-military/), and has even nominated former Boeing board member, Patrick Shanahan, to [lead the Pentagon](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2019/05/10/trump-nominates-embodiment-military-industrial-complex-patrick-shanahan-lead).



However, critics of the current U.S. military system, like U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, have openly [attacked the current system](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2019/08/02/we-cannot-keep-handing-over-billions-military-industrial-complex-says-sanders-senate), saying that current spending and management is causing a so-called [death spiral in the defense industry](http://nation.time.com/2011/07/19/the-defense-death-spiral/). Senator Warren has proposed plans to [ban military contractors from hiring former Pentagon officials](https://www.defensenews.com/congress/2019/05/16/elizabeth-warren-announces-plan-to-unravel-military-industrial-complex/), and [proposes a bill that would curb Defense Lobbying](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/elizabeth-warren-introduces-bill-to-curb-defense-lobbying/), which has had reports of ["wasteful contractor payments"](https://www.forbes.com/sites/charlestiefer/2018/10/05/republicans-and-contractor-lobbies-force-defense-into-wasteful-contractor-payments/)

Even Donald Trump himself, has [lambasted the military industrial complex at times](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/oct/9/donald-trump-laments-endless-wars-amid-syria-backl/)


What are the pros and cons of nationalising the U.S. Defense Industry? 

Are there any examples of other countries implementing something similar? If so, what were the results and/or effects?

Is there any mainstream support for this idea?
