Advice for Marketing graduate wanting to get into graphic design and animation?
Sorry in advance if the flair is wrong I am kind of new here.

So I have been in my current “Marketing” job for about a year and a half. I noticed I do not want to be in marketing and I should have done something else in college. My cousin does a lot of graphic work and 3D animation and I realized that is something that I find really interesting and would maybe want to get into. He helped me out with learning some things on Adobe After Effects and Premiere but I do not know where or how to start. I have used some tutorials to learn things through youtube and started to build a small portfolio with those projects but I know that wouldnt be enough. Does anyone know of a good way to transition into something like this?
