McDonald's employee just saved my life.
This is probably not the right subreddit, but whatever. I just needed to say this.

It was 4 AM. 

I was cold. I was lonely. I was tired. I was intoxicated. I was depressed. I was just about ready to finally put a bullet through the roof of my mouth.

But I hadn't eaten in three days, and I sure as hell wasn't dying on an empty stomach.

I stepped outside and lit a cigarette. It was going to be the last cigarette I would ever smoke.

I walked to my local McDonald's. It was the only place still open. It was completely empty. There was one employee left, manning the cash register.

I placed my order and pulled out my debit card.

"Sorry, the system's down, we're cash only for about 10 more minutes."

I nodded and took a seat in a nearby booth. I could wait for 10 minutes.

I listened to the song on the radio. "Just a couple more minutes," he said.

Another song went by. Then another, then another, then another, and another... 

He walked out, bag in hand, and handed it over to me. "Don't worry about it," he said.

Confused, I walked to the cash register, debit card at the ready. "So is it ready yet?"

"Don't worry about it."

I was shocked. "Thank you, sir."

I walked out, returned home, and had the best, free, 5 dollar meal I've ever had in my entire life.

I won't kill myself tonight. Maybe I won't, ever. 

Thanks man.
