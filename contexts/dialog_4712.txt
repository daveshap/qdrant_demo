MARION: You've been here before?
WILLIAM: Some nights. I have dreams. Mostly dreams I don't want. I started riding at night to fill up my mind so that when I did sleep I'd dream only of the ride and the adventure.
MARION: Did it work?
WILLIAM: No. You don't choose your dreams. Your dreams choose you.
WILLIAM: I want... to marry you!
MARION: I... accept your proposal!
WILLIAM: I'm not just saying it!
MARION: Nor I!
WILLIAM: But I won't give you up to any nobleman.
MARION: You scare me.
WILLIAM: I don't want to scare you. I want to be yours, and you mine. Every night like this one.
MARION: This night is too beautiful to have again.
WILLIAM: I will be with you, like this. Forever.
