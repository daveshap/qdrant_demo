Is it possible to install different display drivers for each user account? Is it possible to install a display driver for one account (for example an NVIDIA display driver), and use another version for the second one?Currently I'm trying to test between two methods of installing a framework. One uses deb package which installs all dependencies automatically.In the other one however, I am the one who installs all needed dependencies.Each method has its own pros and cons. My main problem is that if I use the first method, it will install a lot of dependencies, kernel headers, development packages, etc that may cause me issues. I do not know if I can be able to unroll all the changes the first method causes.So I'm asking if creating a new user-account would give me the same capability so if one account gets ruined I would still be able to use the other account and be just fine.
