MICKEY: Much obliged. What do I do for fun? Do you want to know what I do for fun or what I did for fun?
WAYNE: What? Oh, aaahhh, what you did for fun for starters.
MICKEY: What I did for fun for starters. Well, something I used to do...always was a lot of fun... No, scratch that. Let me think of something else. In fact, why don't we come back to that question. Ask me something else.
WAYNE: Do you miss Mallory?
MICKEY: Of course, I miss Mallory. She's my wife. I haven't seen her in a long time. What a stupid question.
WAYNE: Then was it worth it?
MICKEY: Was what worth it?
WAYNE: Was massacring all those people worth being separated from your wife for the rest of your life?
MICKEY: Do you think up these questions or the girl with no tongue?
WAYNE: No, Mickey, I can't let you get away with that shit. Answer the question. Was it worth it? You haven't seen, heard, or smelled Mallory in a year. Was it worth it?
MICKEY: Was an instant of purity worth a lifetime lie? Yeah, it was.
WAYNE: Excuse me, did you say an instant of purity? What was the instant of purity? The bodies you left behind on your bloody trail?
MICKEY: That's only part of it. I mean, it's a big, big, big part. But it's only the chorus, it's not the whole song.
WAYNE: Please explain to me, Mickey, where's the purity that you couldn't live without in five year old Danny Millhouse's blown off head? Where's the purity in forty-eight people who are no longer on this planet because they met you and Mallory? What's so fucking pure about that?
