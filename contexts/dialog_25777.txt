PICARD: There's still no indication of why they attacked the station?
RIKER: We think they were looking for something- they practically tore the place apart.
PICARD: Hmm, Inform Starfleet Command. This could indicate a new Romulan threat in this sector.
RIKER: You want me to contact Starfleet?
PICARD: Is there a problem?
RIKER: No, sir.
PICARD: Thank you, Number One.
RIKER: There is something else, Captain. One of the scientists, a Doctor Soran,has insisted on speaking with you. I told him you were busy, sir, but he said it was absolutely imperative that he speak with you right away.
PICARD: Understood. That will be all.
RIKER: Sir, is there anything wrong?
PICARD: No. Thank you.
