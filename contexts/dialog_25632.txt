STAR MAN: I don't understand.
MAN: Parlez vous Francais?... Habla Ingles?... Sprechen zie deutsch?
MAN: Good job, neither do I. What do you do for a living?
STAR MAN: I don't understand.
MAN: I'm a cook. Do you understand 'cook?'
STAR MAN: No.
COOK: Food. Eat. I prepare food. I work as a cook. That's how I make money.
STAR MAN: I understand.
COOK: What do you do?
STAR MAN: I make maps.
COOK: Hey, that sounds interesting. You like it?
STAR MAN: Eh... yes.
COOK: Make any money?
STAR MAN: No.
COOK: You don't get rich as a cook, either, believe me. I got a girl going to college this fall. The wife had to go back to nursing to help pay for it.
