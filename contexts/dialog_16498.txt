MR. EDDY: I'm leavin' the Caddy, like I told you. Think you'll get a chance to give her a once over today?
PETE: Sure... Sure, Mr. Eddy. You gonna pick it up later, or tomorrow?
MR. EDDY: If you think you can finish it, I'll be back later today.
PETE: It'll be ready.
MR. EDDY: You're my man, Pete.
SHEILA: What do you want?
PETE: Nothin'... You want to go for a drive?
SHEILA: I don't know.
PETE: Come on... get in.
