How can I avoid electrostatic discharge? I recently started an internship in an office with a rugged floor everywhere. After a few days, I started receiving electrostatic discharge all the time after I walked a little bit around the floor (probably due to the rug). Everytime I walk around, and then come back to my computer, I get shocked when I touch it. Things I tried: Using different shoes to prevent the electrostatic buildupChange my power adapter, so it would be better grounded (don't know if it actually makes sense, but I tried anyway)Changing various devices at my desk (monitor, smartphone charger, etc.)Things I cannot do (I'm not alone in this office)Removing the rug (obviously)Wear an electrostatic wrist strap (unless they exist without having to be clamped somewhere)Setting the humidity level in the officeIs there any trick I could use to avoid getting shocked after I walked on the rug?
