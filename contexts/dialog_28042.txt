MICHAEL: It's early. Why do we have to go home?
LUCY: Bring your own wheels tomorrow night and you can stay as long as you want... well 'til eleven thirty maybe.
MICHAEL: I'll hitch.
LUCY: Oh, no, you won't.
SAM: Mom, you hitched all the way to Berkeley once, remember?
MICHAEL: Mom, just give me five more minutes. Just five minutes, okay?
SAM: He met a girl.
LUCY: I guess no one cares what I got a job.
SAM: Can we get a T.V.?
