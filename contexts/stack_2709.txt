Given a set of curved geodesics in 2D space, is there a way to determine the geometrical shape of said space? I know that the geodesics for Euclidean Space are straight lines and likewise in the absence of forces like gravity, the geodesics are straight lines. But what if you took some curved lines and tried to work backwards to determine the geometry of the space consisting of the curved geodesics. How would one go about determining the shape of this space? Would this even be a possible or useful approach?
