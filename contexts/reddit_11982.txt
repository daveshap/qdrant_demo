I'm having my vestibular system removed/destroyed in both ears tomorrow, and I'm worried since I read an article saying you need vestibular hair cells to breathe. Is this true?

I have meniere's so i get extremely bad dizzy spells. i opted to have my vestibular system in both ears removed, but since the referral for surgery i accidentally came across a news article saying how you need vestibular hair cells to be able to breathe during sleep. the scientist's name was Reubens and he said the hair cells in your vestibular part of the ear detect CO2 and tell your body to breathe and if both vestibulars in the ear are damaged, there will be no or very little response to CO2, and he said people with damaged vestibular hair cells could stop breathing in their sleep. this worried me a lot. the study was done on mice but a review said the experiment also damaged the mice's brains so i am unsure if it was damage to the brains causing the results of the study or chemical removal of their vestibular system.

a follow up paper said mice with damaged ears lost 60% of their respiratory drive to CO2, meaning 60% of the cells responsible for telling the body to breathe were gone.
