SHAUNESSY: Whom you've seen twice in a year? Mrs. Kramer, your ex-husband, wasn't he the longest personal relationship in your life?
JOANNA: I suppose...
SHAUNESSY: Would you speak up, Mrs. Kramer? I couldn't hear you.
JOANNA: Yes.
SHAUNESSY: How long was that?
JOANNA: We were married two years before the baby. And then four very difficult years.
SHAUNESSY: So, you were a failure at the longest, most important relationship in your life.
GRESSEN: Objection!
JUDGE: Overruled.
JOANNA: I was not a failure.
SHAUNESSY: Oh? What do you call it then --a success? The marriage ended in divorce.
JOANNA: I consider it less my failure than his.
SHAUNESSY: Congratulations, Mrs. Kramer. You have just rewritten matrimonial law. You were both divorced, Mrs. Kramer.
GRESSEN: Objection!
SHAUNESSY: Your honor, I'd like to ask what this model of stability and respectability has ever succeeded at? Mrs. Kramer, were you a failure at the longest, most important personal relationship in your life?
