Tips on staying motivated after getting turned down from interviews.
Hello, about a month ago i was layed off from my job. its been a struggle these past few weeks during the job search. I have worked for the past 5+ years without being unemployed this is my first month in 5 years being unemployed so its very tough at the moment. The past few weeks i have had some big interviews for some really good jobs. I work in Information Technology and i consider my field to be very competitive i live in a decently populated area of about 100,000 people however it is not the same as being a big city Atlanta, Washington, California where there is more opportunity in the field. I had 3 final interviews the past week 1 job was actually a referral from a friend that works for the company i had really high hopes at getting that job they even had me come in before the final interview to shadow to get used to the systems. Today i received three emails "thanks for applying but we have decided to move on" kind of thing from all three jobs today " today has crushed me which is why i cannot sleep and looking for advice. I guess its back to the drawing board tomorrow.
