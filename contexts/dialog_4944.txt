LEONARD: Well...why did you put a knife in it?
WALTER: I didn't mean to.
LEONARD: Got carried away, huh?
LEONARD: Alright, I'll tell you what. I'll put it in the corner of the alcove. If it sells, we'll split it fifty- fifty. How's that?
WALTER: Sure! So I guess that means I'm an artist after all.
CARLA: Maybe so...
LEONARD: I wouldn't give up your day job.
WALTER: All that is comes through the eye of the artist...
LEONARD: Alright get a grip on yourself Now since you're here why don't you start early, the kitchen needs cleaning.
WALTER: Sure!
WALTER: You really like it?
CARLA: Of course...it's wonderful.
