Career prospects seem lower than they were before graduating college
It's been close to 3 years and the only places that took me were a call center that axed me when their seasonal period was over and the military, which outprocessed me after a training injury. Low GPA of 2.7, only a few jobs from college working in customer service and sales, and a useless degree in biology... seems like all I need is a bullet to the head. I've reworked the resume, proactively reached out to companies I applied to, applied to positions that nobody would seem to want in places that nobody would want to live, still nothing. No criminal record, no disabilities, but no opportunities or potential. Weren't we all supposed to make it?
