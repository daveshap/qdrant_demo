I was laid off but the company received a government bailout and layoffs were rescinded. What are my obligations?
As outlined in the titled, I received a written letter issuing my layoff on March 30th. My boss texted me that they're paying us regardless of available work.

However my issue with this all is that I am due for a raise, it's been two years and I've seen <50 cent (CAD) pay increase across that whole time (and I'm already underpaid as it is). My question is am I obligated to accept the recall of layoffs? I'm ready to walk away. I have two job offers on the table and a third in the works. 

Can I essentially treat this as a job offer and negotiate for a higher pay? I expected to get a new official offer essentially rather than "hey jk about the layoffs come to work monday"
