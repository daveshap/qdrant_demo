Are there any cities that tend to vote Republican as opposed to Democrat?
[CityLab had a great article](http://www.citylab.com/politics/2013/02/what-makes-some-cities-vote-democratic/4598/) about why cities tend to vote democratic, which is definitely worth a read.

But are there any examples of cities or major urban populations (I'm leaving this deliberately open ended) that tend to vote Republican, or at least go back and forth?

Which cities? Why?

At the suggestion of others, lets narrow the definition of cities to cities with a population over 100,000
[as seen here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_cities_by_population)

Also lets not limit this question just to Donald Trump. I'd love to see information that spans far before the last election cycle
