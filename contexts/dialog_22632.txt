CARTER: I wouldn't do that!!!
LEE: It's a bomb.
ISABELLA: You see, no bomb. Now stay away before I throw you both in jail for obstruction.
CARTER: Throw us in jail? I'm about to bust you right now.
ISABELLA: I'm an undercover agent for the United States Secret Service.
CARTER: How do we know you're not lying? Let me see your badge.
CARTER: Let me see it again?
LEE: We can help you. I'm a detective in Hong Kong.
ISABELLA: I know who you are, Inspector Lee.
LEE: Then you know I'm not walking away from this case.
CARTER: Yeah, that's right.
ISABELLA: We need to get out of sight. Come down to my suite.
ISABELLA: Look, I've been working this case for months now...
CARTER: So what's your story?
ISABELLA: They think I'm a crooked customs agent.
LEE: Is this a payoff?
ISABELLA: No. It's a sample. You guys ever heard of the Superbill?
CARTER: It's a myth. Some kind of counterfeit.
ISABELLA: It's much more than a counterfeit. 14 out of 15 world banks can't tell the difference. The paper is Crane linen blend -- and the bills are printed on U.S. Intaglio presses.
CARTER: How're they getting into the U.S. Mint to use the presses?
ISABELLA: In 1959, the United States was very friendly with the Shah of Iran. We wanted his oil, so for the Shah's birthday, the government gave him a gift -- a U.S. Treasury Intaglio press. The only one to ever leave the country. Five years ago Ricky Tan bought that press on the black market.
