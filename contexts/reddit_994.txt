I am too sensitive for this world
Does anyone else just break down crying whenever they make the smallest mistake? I am so worried about never being good enough that anytime I do something wrong or can’t figure something out, the tears start coming. I feel like I have absolutely no control over my emotions and it’s humiliating me. I started crying in class, in front of my supervisor, and in public, all for reasons that seem so small in retrospect. But when I start crying I get so embarrassed that it makes me cry even more. My dad told me I need to grow a thicker skin and my supervisor told me my body language is always aloof and uncaring when I’m turning away to avoid making eye contact to try and stop the tears. I can’t seem to win. I can’t even check my email anymore because I’m so afraid to see someone saying I’ve done something wrong. I don’t feel as if I was made to fit into this world where I can’t even be told I’m not doing good enough without completely breaking down. What can I even do? I feel like I’ve lost all control of my life.
