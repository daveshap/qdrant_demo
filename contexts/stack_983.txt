Temporarily switch to a full-screen, hairline cursor I sometimes would like to have my cursor appear as crosshair lines going across the full screen (one vertical line, one horizontal line). I need it because I often look at statistical plots and would like to be able to quickly read an approximate value for a given point.Is there a simple way of achieving this?My current system: Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, with Unity.
