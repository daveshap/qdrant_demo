MIMI: Excuse me -- ?
ANDY: Do you wanna wrestle? It's a good way of breaking the ice. That instant physical intimacy really brings two people together.
MIMI: What are you talking about?! We just met an hour ago.
ANDY: No no no, it's not sex! I mean -- it can lead to sex... but really, it's just wrestling.
MIMI: I don't wanna talk about it!
ANDY: What do you mean?
MIMI: I mean -- uh -- the colors in the sky are so vibrant. I love this time of day.
ANDY: I've never understood that. It's just... getting dark. But I like you! Hey! Why don't we fill the car with gas, drive to Tijuana, and GET MARRIED???
