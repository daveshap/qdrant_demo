Interview got cancelled because the job was filled.
I need to vent. I have been looking for jobs in the area I’m planning on moving to for a few months now and it really hasn’t panned out at all. I keep getting ghosted or rejected by potential employers and it’s pushing back mine and my SO’s moving timeline. I finally scored an interview (or so I thought) but I didn’t get a call at the scheduled time. I waited half an hour, was just about to email the person back to reschedule when I saw they sent me a generic “Thank you for your time” email letting me know the position got filled. I’m beyond frustrated and distraught with this round of job searching, no one values your time whatsoever. I was always prompt with my email responses, while they sometimes took over two days to respond causing me to miss en earlier interview window where MAYBE I would have had a chance to present myself. 

I might edit this post later, but I’m not sure what else to add. Thanks for reading.
