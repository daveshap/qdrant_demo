Traineeship in a different field
Hello! Does anyone know the go about traineeships here in Sydney, NSW?

I have a diploma in business administration and a diploma in event management and so far I've been working in the hospitality industry. I am looking for a career change and I don't have much experience outside of administration, food & beverage and customer service. 

So I wanted to know if I am able to go for a traineeship even though I already have "degrees" in other fields - thinking of something like child care for example. 

Thank you for you help! ✌️🏼
