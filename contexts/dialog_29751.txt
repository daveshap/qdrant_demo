GIB: I thought this look like your work.
HARRY: Let's go. I'll brief you in the air.
GIB: You're welcome.
GIB: --you tell the son of bitch this is Bright Boy Alert. Repeat, a Bright Boy Alert. And I need a patch of the White House ASAP. That's right--
HARRY: ... the Coast Guard has to clear them back to a twenty mile radius. Anybody that can't make the minimum safe distance we need an airlift on, immediately--
GIB: I can get 3 Marine Corps Harriers here in about 12 minutes. They're on maneuvers out of Boca Chica.
HARRY: Get 'em. I'll brief them on the way in.
JUNO: Like one?
HELEN: Fuck you.
GIB: ... well get the Highway Patrol to go through the streets and tell everybody on their damn loudspeakers. Just the basics... get away from windows, don't look at it... yeah--
HARRY: Here they come.
