NICK: Short shift?
CONNIE: Yeah... I came to save you. If you're hopeless, I'll pull the plug.
CONNIE: It's getting too cold even for me, Nick.
NICK: Connie...
CONNIE: All right, how's the new partner?
NICK: High spirits, desire, commitment.
CONNIE: You'll take care of that.
NICK: Give me a break, would you?
CONNIE: If you give me one.
NICK: Are you expecting anyone?
CONNIE: I wasn't expecting you.
