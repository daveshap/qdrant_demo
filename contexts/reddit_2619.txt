Has anyone ditched their 9-5 for something with weirder hours?
Im a 22M 4 months into my (accounting) 9-5 job, which is actually more like an 8-6. Sometimes worse. I hate it. My SO is an overnight nurse who works 36 hours a week (3- 12 hour shifts), makes more, and sometimes even has 6 days in a row off. I’m so envious of her work life.

So, has anyone here left their 9-5 for something with less structure? I have no responsibilities outside of myself, so it’s not like kids are preventing me from doing this. I can’t stand sitting at my desk 10 hours, barely moving, and then doing it again 4 more times.
