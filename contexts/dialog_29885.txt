SARAH: You lied to me about those school books. I found them upstairs on your bed.
LAURA: What were you doing in my room?

LAURA: I had to see Bobby. I know you really don't like Bobby, but there was a problem and I didn't think you would understand.
SARAH: Oh, honey, you don't have to lie to me. Ever. You can tell me anything. I'll understand.
LAURA: I'm sorry, Mom.
