ANNIE: How long is this going to go on?
GRACE: What?
ANNIE: You know what I mean? Is this it now? Is this the way we're going to be from now on?
ANNIE: Do you want us to turn around and go back home? Do you?
GRACE: What are you asking me for? You didn't ask me if I wanted to come in the first place -- now I get to decide? Forget it!
ANNIE: Who do you think I'm doing this for? I'm doing this for you!
GRACE: Bullshit! It's about you! About you deciding! About you always being right! You always getting everything your way, controlling everybody -- like we work for you or something!
ANNIE: I don't believe this!
GRACE: You just want to get away from Daddy and you're using me to do it!
ANNIE: That's not true! Whatever problems your father and I are having, have nothing to do with this.
GRACE: You're amazing! You act like I don't live in that house! Don't you think I hear the two of you!? Don't you think I can tell what's going on? I'm not five years old, Mom! You want to divorce Daddy and Daddy doesn't want to.
ANNIE: Did he tell you that?
GRACE: He doesn't have to! It's, like, so obvious you can't stand him.
ANNIE: That's not true!
GRACE: Then why do you want to leave?
ANNIE: It's... it's not that simple to explain. I know you think it is, but it's not. The truth is, I don't really know what I want to do. I don't have all the answers.
GRACE: No, you just act like you do.
