JOE: Why'd you ask him.
RENE: He's a client of mine! What's the matter. You can't suspect Dieter. He's a famous photographer. He makes millions.
JOE: Maybe I'm wrong. Then GRUNER won't be here.
DIETER: What are you doing here, where've you been?
RENE: I have a new client.
DIETER: That crazy guy?
RENE: Yes. Joe.
