JOE: Perhaps the Jam-in-ator" appeals to you. Absolutely no practice necessary. You shread like a giant. Just press a button."
ENID: That's okay...
ENID: Do you have any other old records besides these?
JOE: Seymour does.
ENID: Who does?
JOE: Him. Seymour. He's the man with the records.
ENID: Do you have any old Indian records?
SEYMOUR: Indian records?
ENID: You know, like weird 1960's Indian rock n' roll music.
SEYMOUR: I don't have anything after about 1935. I may have one Hindu 78 from the twenties in my collection, but it's not really for sale. I don't really collect foreign.""
SEYMOUR: Those are all 78s... Can you play 78s?
ENID: Sure!... Wait, maybe not 78s, but I can play regular records...
SEYMOUR: There's some good stuff in here... do you like old music?
ENID: Sure, I guess.
SEYMOUR: Well there's a few choice LPs in here that re-issue some really great old blues stuff.
ENID: Is this one any good?
SEYMOUR: Nah, it's not so great. Here's the one I'd recommend.
SEYMOUR: This track alone by Memphis Minnie is worth about $500 if you have the original 78. She was one of the greatest guitar players that ever lived, and a great singer and songwriter as well. I know the guy who owns the original and lent it for use on this reissue.
ENID: Wow!
ENID: How much is it?
SEYMOUR: A dollar seventy-five.
ENID: Okay.
