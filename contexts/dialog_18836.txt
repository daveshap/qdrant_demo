THOMAS J: They're not gonna let us in Vada, we're kids.
VADA: We're not gonna bet, we're just gonna watch.
THOMAS J: Watch bingo? I don't even like to play bingo.
VADA: Duck!
SHELLY: Oh great!
THOMAS J: Hey there's your Dad and Shelly.
VADA: Ssshhhhh, I don't want them to see me.
SHELLY: Aarrggh.
SHELLY: I just had a terrible thought Harry.
HARRY: What's that?
SHELLY: I'm gonna be putting makeup on some of these people very soon.
HARRY: Why d'you think these seats were empty.
THOMAS J: Can we go yet?
VADA: Go???
THOMAS J: You know I'm not allowed outside my myself after dark.
SHELLY: Oh, I'm just not lucky Harry.
HARRY: Look, it's not always luck, I mean, depending upon the placement of the numbers, a guy with 10 cards could win just as easily as a guy with 100.
SHELLY: Kinda like men.
HARRY: Oh, how do you mean?
SHELLY: You can be in a room with 100 men, and not like any of them, or you can be in a room with just one man, and he's exactly the one you want.
