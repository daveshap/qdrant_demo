EDWARD: We can reach an understanding on this.
DAVID: I don't think so. You should know we're going to fight you with every resource we have.

DAVID: I do. I take it all very personally. Very nice meeting you, Vivian.
EDWARD: And that's the way the game is played.
VIVIAN: Some game. Screwin' some poor slob out of his retirement.
