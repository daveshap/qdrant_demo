PAUL: I know you do. I love you too, Annie. And you're right. We are meant to be together. And I know we must die. But it must be so that Misery can live. We have the power to give Misery eternal life. We must finish the book.
ANNIE: But the time is now. Soon others will come.
PAUL: It's almost done. By dawn we'll be able to give Misery back to the world.
