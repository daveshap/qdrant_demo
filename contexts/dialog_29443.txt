FRANCISCO: You were followed by the police, but they won't hear us over the children. I want to use a bomb.
HELENA: You're kidding. Can't you shoot him or something?
FRANCISCO: I don't really like guns. You shoot someone in the head three times and some doctor will keep them alive.
HELENA: When will you do it?
FRANCISCO: I don't know. Eduardo Ruiz is the only real witness against Carl. The security is very tight. There may not be a way.
HELENA: There's always a way. If people get to the Pope or the President, you can get to him.
