BARON: Please do not be frightened, Madam.
GRUSINSKAYA: What do you want here?
BARON: Nothing -- only to be here.
GRUSINSKAYA: Why do you hide in my room?
BARON: But surely you must know -- because I love you.
GRUSINSKAYA: Because you love me -- you love me?
BARON: Poor little Grusinskaya! Does it do you good to cry? Are you afraid? Shall I go?
GRUSINSKAYA: I was so alone -- always alone -- and suddenly you were there and said that. No. I am not afraid. It is strange.
BARON: Don't cry -- it tears my heart to see you sob like that.
GRUSINSKAYA: Nerves -- just nerves. You must forgive me. I have had a bad evening. I am very tired. Do you know what it is to be tired -- tired of a routine existence?
BARON: I'm afraid not -- I usually do just what I feel like doing at the moment.
GRUSINSKAYA: So you feel like coming into a lady's room -- and you come... What now?
BARON: I'd like to smoke a cigarette.
GRUSINSKAYA: Certainly.
GRUSINSKAYA: Why do you look at me like that?
BARON: I did not know you were so beautiful... and --
GRUSINSKAYA: And then --?
BARON: No irony. You're so appealing -- so soft -- so tired. I feel like taking you in my arms and not letting anything more happen to you -- ever.
GRUSINSKAYA: And -- and --
BARON: How tired you are!
GRUSINSKAYA: Yes -- tired...
BARON: So alone.
GRUSINSKAYA: Alone. All alone. Oh, you strange -- strange creature.
BARON: You mustn't talk Russian to me.
GRUSINSKAYA: Strange man...
BARON: Am I quite strange to you?
GRUSINSKAYA: Not quite strange now. It is as if I had been expecting you. You know, once when the Grand Duke was alive, I found a man hiding in my room -- a young officer --
BARON: And...?
GRUSINSKAYA: He disappeared. Later he was found dead.
BARON: I never knew it was so dangerous to hide in a woman's room when she's alone.
GRUSINSKAYA: Go away. Who are you --?
BARON: A man who could love -- that is all, who has forgotten everything else for you.
GRUSINSKAYA: You could love me. It is so long since I have heard that word. Nobody has loved me for a long time. It is so icy-cold to be famous. One is so cruelly alone. How is it that you -- Let me look at you. Your hands. Your eyes. Why could you love me?
BARON: I saw you just now -- then I saw you cry -- and now I see you in the mirror -- Grusinskaya...
GRUSINSKAYA: Grusinskaya... Oh -- oh if you knew how I slaved and slaved for Grusinskaya -- for the success of Grusinskaya -- for the triumph of Grusinskaya... and what is she now? Just someone who has found that on the day success ceases life ceases -- Are you listening to me -- Do you understand? -- I want you to understand.
BARON: Yes -- I do understand.
GRUSINSKAYA: I think you must go now -- the key is on the floor.
BARON: I'm not going -- You know I'm not going -- Let me stay here?
GRUSINSKAYA: I want to be alone.
BARON: That is not so -- you don't want to be alone.
GRUSINSKAYA: I want to be alone --
BARON: No -- You don't want to be alone at all -- You were in despair before -- If I left you, you'd feel worse than you did before, You must not be alone -- You mustn't cry -- you must forget... Tell me that I can stay with you -- tell me.
GRUSINSKAYA: Just for a minute then.
