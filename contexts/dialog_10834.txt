STANTZ: Forget it. The Vienna Boys Choir couldn't get through this stuff.
VENKMAN: Good effort. Now what? Should we say supportive, nurturing things to it, Ray?
SPENGLER: It won't work. There's no way we could generate enough positive energy to crack that shell.
STANTZ: I can't believe things have gotten so bad in this city that there's no way back. Sure, it's crowded, it's dirty, it's noisy. And there are too many people who'd just as soon step on your face as look at you. But there've got to be a few sparks of sweet humanity left in this burned-out burg. We just have to mobilize it.
SPENGLER: We need something that everyone can get behind, a symbol --
STANTZ: Something that appeals to the best in each and every one of us --
SPENGLER: Something good --
VENKMAN: And pure --
WINSTON: And decent.
HARDEMEYER: Look, I've had it with you. Get your stuff together, get back in that clown car and get out of here. This is a city matter and everything's under control.
VENKMAN: Oh, you think so? Well, I've got news for you. You've got Dracula's brother-in-law in there and he's got my girlfriend and her kid. Around about midnight tonight, when you're partying uptown, this guy's going to come to life and start doing amateur head transplants. And that's just round one.
