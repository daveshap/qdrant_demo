Harry Potter funny fanfic, where Harry is convinced he is an elf - probably on fanfiction.net There's a fic where Harry runs away or gets left outside after finding a book in a library on magic and believing he is an elf.He grows up learning \"wish for a trade\" or magic for a trade bartering and such, meeting odd people along the way, multiheaded snakes, I think Mr. Lovegood, child Malfoy, and more until he's old enough to go to Hogwarts and someone finds him and enrolls him.There are already several fanfics as its a series going up by each year or two. They are also definitely over 30-50k+ or more. It's really funny and everyone keeps trying to convince him he's not an elf, except either Malfoy or Granger or some unexpected friend; not the usual trio.It might also be on Archive of Our Own, but I'm very sure it's fanfiction.net as that was my soul and life blood until recently.
