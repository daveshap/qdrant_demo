I’m desperately trying to stay sober and I’m failing.
I’ve been struggling with substance abuse for the past 13 years. I quit opioids 7 years ago and haven’t touched them since. But it’s alcohol that has a hold on me. When I drink, I drink until I’m blackout drunk. I wake up with the shakes. I’ve gone to rehab but I’ve gone downhill since then. I’m subscribed to quit drinking subreddits on here but I never really post. I’ve been hospitalized 3 times this year because of alcohol. All because my throat is starting to bleed when I drink. I’m only 31 and I know I won’t make it to 40 if I don’t quit. I don’t know I just needed to say this out loud.
