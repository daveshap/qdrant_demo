LOUIS: How do we seem to you? Do you think us beautiful, magical, our white skin, our fierce eyes? Drink, you ask me! Have you any idea of the thing you will become?
CLAUDIA: Your evil is that you cannot be evil! And I will suffer for it no longer!
LOUIS: Don't make me, Claudia! I cannot do it!
CLAUDIA: Yet you could do it to me! Snatching me from my mother's hands like two monsters in a fairy-tale! Couldn't you have waited? Six more years and I would have had that shape! And now you weep! You haven't tears enough for what you've done to me.
