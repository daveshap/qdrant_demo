MRS. MOEBIUS: Do you have a suit? Let's get him one.... And a cell phone too. And if you insist on blowing up a synagogue, make it that big one on Fifth Avenue, would you?
DANNY: Beth Shalom? It's Reform.
MRS. MOEBIUS: So what?
DANNY: They're not that Jewish.
MRS. MOEBIUS: I don't care what they are. I know those people, and I don't like them. The rest are just a bunch of kikes, aren't they?
