People of Reddit, Tell me the lamest lie a potential love interest tried telling you.
Here is mine

Met a guy off Pof.com (avoid this site if it still exists) talked for a few weeks and hung out a few times before a big date. Now I felt this guy was a little off but I thought it was me being an asshole because I totally can be anyways he would want to come to my house to hang out but he never would want to hang at his house that he paid for because his grandparents didn't like strangers. I also lived with my grandparents at the time so I just figured hey old peeps set in their ways. 
Fast forward to a week before our big date, now before I go on a real date, I try to get to know everything about the person online first so we chatted about everything our current lives, our pasts, what we want in the future etc so I thought i had gotten to know him pretty well
Hahaha since you are still reading,  you know damn well that's not that case so one night I go out to dinner at home town buffet with my grandparents and I see him and of course Im happy to see him and say hey....well the guy pales...I mean goes ghost white and wide-eyed like I was Pennywise from It, being confused as hell I take off my hat and tell him hey its me and he just slightly waves and takes off the in other direction

And sits down with a woman and a little boy the spitting image of him. Humiliated, I hurriedly finish my meal as my grandfather is telling me how ashamed I should be as if I should have somehow known. 

An hour later, I get a text saying "Hey baby, I heard you met my twin"

This is why I feel some people go all FBI with a new love interest. 

TD;LR Potential love interest and me ran into each other at hometown buffet while he was there with his wife and kid and later tried telling me it was his twin. Never mentioned twin at all.
