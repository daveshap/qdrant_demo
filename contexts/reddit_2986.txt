Realized I make LESS now than I did when hired 5 years ago. Now what?!

32M, BSA, 7 years experience in current role, 5 at current org

I’ve been in my position w current org for five years now. Over that time I’d guess my overall skills pertaining to this position improved 50%, and the job has undoubtedly gotten more complex.

I’ve only gotten positive yearly reviews and feedback. Last year I asked my manager (and his manager) what it would take to get to the next level, and was not given an answer, just lip service. Lack of path forward is a complaint I’ve heard from all of my coworkers, and as such we face increasing turnover.

To add salt to the wound, yesterday I compared my first paycheck in early 2015 with this company to the most recent paycheck and the difference is lesser than increase in inflation for that time period. That is, I effectively make LESS now than I did when I was hired. We’ve also lost some benefits and now pay more for healthcare, compounding this issue.

What next? Do I threaten to leave without a substantial raise, or do I just get out? Only issue is current job is walking distance from home, comparable position elsewhere would include :30 commute.

Yes, I should have addressed stagnant wages years ago, but the last few years have been very busy on a personal level and I just haven’t.
