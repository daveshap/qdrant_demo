Why does it seem like every field nowadays is over-saturated and competitive?
For example, to name a few:

Web Development / Programming: Mid-2000s, you could get a decent job just knowing some basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The rest you’d learn on the job. Nowadays? You need to know every front-end and back-end language, you need to have an understanding of different frameworks, must have 3-5 years of experience, a portfolio, CS degree, etc.

Nursing: It feels like 2015 is when nursing reached its popularity and started becoming over saturated. Getting into nursing school is now more competitive than ever, and with the exception of some geographic areas, it’s no longer as easy to land a job in nursing (unless of course, you have 5+ years of experience).

IT: I don’t know how IT really used to be back in the day, but nowadays I hear a lot of stories of people struggling to land entry level jobs, despite having certifications and a degree.

Trades: This is usually Reddit’s go-to answer, but apprenticeships are getting more difficult to get into as well (at least in my city). I have friends who are on waitlists and struggling to get in because of the large number of applicants.
