NAZEER: This has nothing to do with me, this, uh, drinking, yeah.
TIM: No, this has everything to do with you.
NAZEER: No, no, she went up by herself. This was not my responsibility.
TIM: Hey it's your roof. It's your fucking problem. Hi, uh, there's an emergency down at the Circle A on first Street, Yeah, Okay. You're fucked now, pal! Um, send an ambulance 'cause I, I think it's an overdose or something. Okay. Okay. Jeff, they're coming. Just wait here. I'm gonna go over to Scuff's and see if he's got his truck. Listen, if she dies, you're gonna be so sorry that you ever showed your brown face in this town!
NAZEER: This has nothing to do with me! She went up by herself. Yeah I tell them don't go on the roof! They can't go on the roof! How is she?
JEFF: I don't know. I think she's breathing.
