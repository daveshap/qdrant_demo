I realized I want a meaningful career, what are my options?
I always wondered why I was never fully happy at my job. I work 8-5 corporate job in business development even though I am given different projects to work on and there is always change. My work doesn't feel meaningful. Our positions only exist to make the company money. My boss also treats lower paying workers like garbage. There's a lot of gossip and it gets on my nerves. I want a more meaningful job where I can help people but I can't stand blood?
