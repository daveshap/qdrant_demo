ROSE: Nothin'. I got myself up, that's all.
DADDY: Got yourself up?
ROSE: Yeah. I'm goin' out.
DADDY: Um-hmm. Well, that is the damndest outfit I ever saw in my life. You walk down the street like that and they'll put you in jail, Rose.
MOTHER: Why, they won't either. She looks pretty. And I wish you wouldn't pick on the poor girl all the time. Don't listen to him, Rose, you look pretty, even beautiful.
ROSE: You're so sweet.
DADDY: If you've got time before you go out
ROSE: Why, sure, always got time to get you a half-a-cup, and one of these days I'm gonna get you a whole cup and see what happens.
DADDY: Um-hmmuhh. I never drink a whole cup, my nerves can't stand the caffeine. Ehh-hh, Lord awful insomnia in reverse last night. Lay there and sweated blood for hours.
DOLL: Daddy, Buddy was up late last night reading little dirty comic books. Mother gave him a dose of castor oil and he cursed it, he took the Lords name in vain, then claimed he hadn't said it. He lied, Daddy.
MOTHER: You mustn't be a tattletale, dear. You mustn't be Delilah-ish and Jezebel-ish toward your brother, dear.
DOLL: I'm only trying to help him, Mother.
BUDDY: Heh, what a hypocrite.
MOTHER: I do wish you'd speak to Brother. It's true he's been looking at those horrible little books again.
DADDY: Lay off of that stuff, son. It upsets your mother.
MOTHER: I'm serious. We forget he's just a child. I wish you'd speak to him.
DADDY: I'll take him with me downtown. And you, too, Rose, if you want a ride.
