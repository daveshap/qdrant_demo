DUDLEY: I'm loathe to kill my brother officers, Edmund.
EXLEY: Tell that to Jack Vincennes. To Stensland.
DUDLEY: Jack was a shame, but Dick Stensland had the audacity to try to sell me my own heroin. Through his whore girl friend. I sent him to make the buy. The rest is history.
EXLEY: Why?
DUDLEY: A vacuum, Edmund. That's what we have in Los Angeles. Sending Mickey Cohen up created it. My containment work maintained it. Certain photographs guarantee it. Organized crime has been held back, but there's still a demand for the services it provides.
EXLEY: And now you'll provide them.
DUDLEY: Absolutely. Prostitution and gambling are victimless crimes. The heroin we'll run down to the coloreds. Anesthetize them. As long as it's not a middle class problem, no one will care. It's still a crime free city... for respectable people.
