GEORGE: People love... comedians.
ANDY: I'm not a comedian. I have no talent. I'm a song-and-dance man.
GEORGE: You show a lot of promise... but... my concern is I don't know where to book you. You're not a stand-up... your act doesn't exactly translate to films... help me... where do you see yourself?
ANDY: I've always wanted to play Carnegie Hall.
