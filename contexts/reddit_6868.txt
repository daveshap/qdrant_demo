Has anyone had the good fortune of getting a job that put you in charge of the person that fired or laid you off?
ngl, it's a fantasy of mine! 

The only person I know that's done it is Jack Dorsey at Twitter -- but I was hoping to hear of more low-profile instances: either you joined another company and then your old manager applied, or you rejoined the company at a level above your old boss.
