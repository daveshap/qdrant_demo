FELICIA: -- is that right?
LESTER: -- yes, we're all trying to do something to make this a better country to live in, believe it or not.
FELICIA: -- is that what this is all about?
LESTER: Yes and you don't have to be sarcastic about it, that's a beautiful thing he's doing -- some people do more than go to the beauty parlor and shop at Saks --
FELICIA: Lester, you're a miserable man. You're not helping anybody. You're just twisting arms to raise money for a lot of silly son of a bitches that are out for themselves -- this is just business, don't kid yourself. And you know the worst thing about it, even if it does somebody some good somewhere which I can't possibly imagine, you'll never know the difference. You're just sweating and kidding yourself - and you're kidding yourself if you think your new business partner is going to keep his hands off that girl -- or that she'll keep her hands off him.
LESTER: What are you talking about?
FELICIA: -- think what you have time to think, Lester.
