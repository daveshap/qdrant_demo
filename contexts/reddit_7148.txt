I Am At A Crossroads - What Can I Start On My Own?
So I work in a big industry as a programmer and have a degree in mathematics. I have worked in corporate for years in various roles - all technical.   

&nbsp;

However, technical matters are not my only strength as many may be inclined to conclude. I also have good interpersonal skills and enjoy reading and writing. In fact, prior to graduating college, I excelled as a server at a restaurant and always made the best tips among my contemporaries - I was good at sales. 

&nbsp; 

But I've hit a ceiling financially in my career in corporate, and I no longer wish to be capped by the corporate structure. I never really wished for it, to be honest. If someone had told me 10 years ago I was on a path to be ultimately capped at such a young age, I would have never continued on this road.  

&nbsp; 

Quite honestly, I feel like I'm on the easiest path to a hard life. Of course, I could keep my job for the foreseeable future - I work on millions of dollars in business and outperform my peers at every juncture.  

&nbsp; 

But I know I will never make enough to accomplish some of the primary goals I have - to fix up my old house, to have my wife work less, and to actually afford a vacation per year (I have a huge bank of vacation days each year, and the only vacation I can really afford is the one where I buy plane tickets to visit my elderly parents at their vacation home - it's not a real vacation).  

&nbsp; 

I am considering roles/industries such as public adjusting, corporate real estate, insurance, or perhaps opening a small software development company/consulting firm. But I am not sure these should be all the career opportunities I should be considering. 

&nbsp;  

Can you all shed some light on some potential career opportunities I could perhaps start on my own with my background and skill set? Consider that I could afford reasonable start up costs (ex: buying a McDonald's franchise is unreasonable; renting an office space is reasonable) and am open to acquiring additional skills/certifications/licenses. I am not open to professions that have a clear cap on potential earnings. I'm also disinclined to go back to college. And working for others for an extended period of time (beyond 2 years) is also undesirable.  

&nbsp; 

I really appreciate your thoughts in advance.
