VOICE: I said SIT DOWN. Who do you work for?
HELEN: Kettleman, Barnes and McGrath. I'm a legal secretary.
VOICE: Of course. Mrs. Tasker. And what were you going with the international terrorist, Carlos the Jackal? Taking dictation?
HELEN: He said he was an American agent.
HARRY: How long have you been a member of his faction?
HELEN: I don't know anything about a faction. I just met Simon... or whatever his name is... a couple of weeks ago. I barely know him.
