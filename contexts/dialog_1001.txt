BILL: Only in some ways. You're prettier...
MARGO: I'm a junk yard.
KAREN: Bill!
BILL: Huh?
KAREN: This is Eve Harrington.
BILL: Hi. My wonderful junk yard. The mystery and dreams you find in a junk yard-
MARGO: Heaven help me, I love a psychotic.
BILL: Hello, what's your name?
EVE: Eve. Eve Harrington.
KAREN: You've already met.
BILL: Where?
KAREN: Right here. A minute ago.
BILL: That's nice.
MARGO: She, too, is a great admirer of yours.
BIRDIE: Imagine. All this admiration in just one room.
