TAYLOR: Ok Mac... I'll talk to you on this. I want to find a way to get to the bridge, then I want you to come back.
MAC: Certainly. Anything I can do to be of service.
DAWN: He certainly is polite.
TAYLOR: Close every door behind you!
TAYLOR: How is it looking, Mac?
MAC: I would recommend a maintenance crew in this sector.
TAYLOR: Is it safe for human transport?
MAC: That's affirmative.
DAWN: It must be oxygenated if we can hear him.
TAYLOR: Yeah, let's hope he can find a way through.
