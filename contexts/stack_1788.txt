How to measure radio signal strength I am building several types of radio antennas, and I would like to test which is the most effective.  I am wondering: What is the best way to measure the strength of the received signal?It is at ~151 MHz and 2 watt transmission power, and I will be testing over a distance of at least a couple of hundred feet. The results don't have to be calibrated, only correct relative to one another. Any ideas?Edit as per comment request:I am transmitting from a handheld unit which is capable of 2, 4, and 8 watt transmission power, but I am using the 2 watt setting to comply with MURS regulations.  The ideal measurement device would be low cost or home made, such as the one described in the answer below.  Thanks in advance.
