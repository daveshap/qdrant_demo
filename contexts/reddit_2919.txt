Just don't understand how to get INTO a career?
Please don't get me wrong - I have an excellent work ethic. I have two university degrees, but I haven't been able to use them. Ever. I just can't really understand or comprehend how to get into a career. I understand needing to start at the bottom and I'm happy to do so. It just seems almost impossible to get noticed. Specifically I have degrees in design and film and television. But this industry is almost like a locked vault, and I just can't break in. 

But it seems the same with a lot of industries. I'm currently thinking of retraining to be something in the arts - perhaps a museum curator or archaeologist or an art historian or something. I also have a passion for fashion and costume design. And writing... But it seems like it would be the same issue. 

How do people actually get into their chosen career paths in this day and age? It seems so difficult to get your foot in the door. I'm really sorry if this comes off as whinging - I'm not. I'm just genuinely at a loss and confused about how to START, and how to do it successfully.
