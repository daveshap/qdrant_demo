Classic Girl Problems
For the love of me I cant get a girl that seems really interested in me, go out with me or will hangout with me! I a sophomore in high school and short for my age/grade, ( 5,4 ) Im a decent looking guy, somewhat popular.. social, not that awkward etc.. I cant find a girl for the love of me.. For example right now I kind of have a " thing " with a freshman girl and she says she wants to hangout, flirts with me, compliments me but whenever I ask her to hangout she makes excuses and we have never hungout yet and ive tried about 5 times.. Another example was a while ago I was talking to a girl I wanted to go out with, Shes very nice, I talk to her, Compliment her, hint im interested in her but she just doesnt like me and isnt interested... Basically Im just wondering what my problem is? is it my height? Can I not be taken serious? Im I trying to force things?
