EDWARD: People needn't worry so much. It's not my time yet. This isn't how I go.
WILL: Really.
EDWARD: Truly. I saw it in The Eye.
WILL: The Old Lady by the swamp.
EDWARD: She was a witch.
WILL: No, she was old and probably senile. Maybe schizophrenic.
EDWARD: I saw my death in that eye. And this is not how it happens.
WILL: So how does it happen?
EDWARD: Surprise ending. Wouldn't want to ruin it for you.
EDWARD: There was this panhandler who used to stop me every morning when I came out of this coffee shop near the office.
WILL: Okay.
EDWARD: And every day I gave him a quarter. Every day. Then I got sick and was out for a couple of weeks. And when I went back there, you know what he said?
WILL: What did he say?
EDWARD: You owe me three-fifty.
WILL: Really.
EDWARD: True story.
WILL: When did you ever work in an office?
EDWARD: There's a lot you don't know about me.
WILL: You're right.
