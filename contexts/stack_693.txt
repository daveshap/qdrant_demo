Newbie needing some help with Wine and PlayonLinux Alright, so I have not used Linux Ubuntu since probably 14.10, but I wanted to come back and was tired of Windows consistent crash and bugs. I like playing games on my PC, I have Wine and PlayonLinux. I am not as literate of the Linux world as I used to be. I don't want to ever switch back, but I am not sure how to get things rolling on here. This is the specs for my laptop. RAM: 4GiB(3.8 usable) Processor: Intel\u00ae Core\u2122 i3-5005U CPU @ 2.00GHz \u00d7 4 Graphics: Intel\u00ae HD Graphics 5500 (Broadwell GT2) I am running on 64bit Ubuntu. I tried installing Star Wars the Old Republic, but it keeps saying it can only run one instance at a time. Any feedback, tips, would be greatly appreciated. I am running Ubuntu 16.04.
