CLAIRE: Did we get it?
ETHAN: We got it. On your feet.
CLAIRE: I want to sleep. Can I sleep here.
ETHAN: Walk, just walk. Start walking.
CLAIRE: I'm walking.
ETHAN: Talking's good, walking's better.
CLAIRE: Sleeping's better.
CLAIRE: Are <u>you</u> all right Ethan. What's wrong with you?
ETHAN: If you're gonna do this again Claire, It's not gonna be on my watch.
CLAIRE: Oh yeah?
JACK: Claire.
ETHAN: Jack.
ETHAN: IS THERE ANY PARTICULAR REASON WE'RE NOT OUT OF HERE YET?!
JACK: Just waiting for you, tubs.
