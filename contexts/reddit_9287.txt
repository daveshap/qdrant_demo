It took 15 months.....
I finally bought a ps4.  It's used, and the controller is kinda busted, but I saved every dime and now I finally have one.

Just wanted to share.  :)

Edit:  I started today just happy to finally buy myself a very rare luxury item.  It snowballed into so many amazing people sending me games they don't play anymore, games they never played and flat out buying games for me.  You all are fucking amazing.  This is crazy.  I just wanted to share that I bought myself something, and you all have made my month.  Thank you all so much.
