What are the low cost, online grad schools?
I have recently graduated from UC Berkeley, and I want to pursue grad school. I want something online, and low cost. 

I am considering Boston Universityâ€™s MBA, Western Governor University, and Georgia Techs OMSCS.

Am I missing another low cost, but credible school or program?
