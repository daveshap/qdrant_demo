Is an RV rental vehicle proof of accommodation for Schengen entry? We are four guys who have a reservation in Germany for an RV (a motor home vehicle). Will our reservation enough at immigration when we arrive, or do we have to reserve hotels?Actually, we plan to stay in Germany for 9 days, and after we are going to Italy and France. We plan to sleep in the RV for the entire time.
