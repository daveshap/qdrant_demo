MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE: Too many people know where you're going, Snake. That's not good. Delgado and his men were back there waiting for you.
PLISSKEN: Delgado?
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE: Cuervo Jones' right-hand man. One tough hombre. You don't understand, Snake. Cuervo Jones wants to unify the island. We're on the move, man. Big time.
PLISSKEN: Stop the damn car.
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE: No way.
PLISSKEN: I said pull over.
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE: All right. Anything for you, Snake. Although I was going to take you to Cuervo Jones' place.
PLISSKEN: Where is it?
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE: Right over there.
