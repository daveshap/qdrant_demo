GRACE: Thank you, Bobby.
BOBBY: You're welcome, Grace.
GRACE: You're not from around here, are you?
BOBBY: Why you say that? Just because I help a lady with her package?
GRACE: You don't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day.
BOBBY: I just drove in this morning.
GRACE: Drove into Superior? What for?
BOBBY: Didn't have a choice. My car overheated up the road.
GRACE: You're lucky you didn't break down in the desert. Day like today, you'd be dead in no time. When you leaving?
BOBBY: Not until my car's fixed. I don't know how long that's going to take.
GRACE: And here I've made you all hot and sweaty.
SHERIFF: Morning Grace.
GRACE: Morning Sheriff. Got my drapes.
SHERIFF: Well it's about time. Looks like you found yourself a helper too.
GRACE: Well, he offered, and I just couldn't refuse. His car overheated.
SHERIFF: Oh?
BOBBY: Morning, officer.
SHERIFF: Son. Little excitement out at the reservation this morning. Wayne and Dale Elkhart were up drinking all night and then Wayne starts chasing Dale around the desert with his shotgun. BIA handled it. I went by for backup.
GRACE: Anybody hurt?
SHERIFF: Hell, no. That Wayne can't shoot when he's sober, much less drunk. He's lucky he didn't kill his own danged self. Well, anyhow, you stay cool. Nice meeting you, son.
