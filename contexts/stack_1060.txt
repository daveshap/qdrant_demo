How to fix/diagnose GUI issues on Ubuntu 18.04/18.10? For the past few weeks, there have been some issues with the GUI lately. I believe these issues started when I installed CUDA 9.0.My machine:GPU: GeForce GTX 1060 Mobile + Intel HD GraphicsOS: Ubuntu 18.10 Cosmic CuttlefishGUI Issues:When switching to tty1 and logging in, the login screen's mousecursor is still there (doesn't occur anymore)Sometimes the, when I try to lock the screen, the display freezes on the Desktop and then a glitch occurs: the system menu keeps showing up multiple times on top of each other)When I login, the screen flashes a couple of times and lags a bitbefore rendering the desktop (I believe this is because of a new TTY is starting up for X Server, although it doesn't happen when I switch to Intel Graphics from NVIDIA X Server Settings -> PRIME Profiles)Sometimes when I logout and try to login, a \"login loop\" occurs where the I enter the password and the login screen keeps showing up instead of the desktop (I have to use chmod on .Xauthority to login)When I lock the screen, and close the lid (suspend) then open it again, I find myself logged out.At first I had Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, I thought if I upgraded to Ubuntu 18.10, these issues would be fixed but nothing happened.Other things I tried:Reinstalled the NVIDIA driversUncommented WaylandEnable=false line in '/etc/gdm3/custom.conf'Switched to LightDM (new issues occured so I switched back to GDM3)Reinstalled GNOME and GDM3Reinstalled X Server (using apt install --reinstall)Is there any way to further diagnose/fix this problem? The only solution I'm thinking of is to install Ubuntu 16.04.
