Confidence is king
I am a 17 year old Male and I have issues with accepting myself and being very self conscious. I always try to dress nice and look skinnier. (I am 5"11 and 250 but look 225) at one point in time people thought I was gay because I always dress nicely. I can talk to girls that I know but when it comes to snapchatting someone new or talking to someone new I am very shy and always 2nd guess myself. Any tips on how to talk to girls that I dont know and to go for someone who is "out of my league"
