Definition of "Course Registration"
Hello all,

Long story short, I last took a course at my local college in 2013. In 2017, I signed up for and then within 10 minutes immediately withdrew from the course.

In addition, my unofficial transcript does not show the withdrawal, and doesn't even show the semester, but they have some internal record where they see this.

There is a program, per college policy, "...available only to students who have not registered for courses at the college for a minimum of five consecutive years." that I would like to apply for.

I'm trying to make the argument that I was not registered for any courses since 2013. I'm trying to find a definition or any supporting argument for why I've not been registered since 2013.

Any ideas?

Really appreciate any time or assistance!
