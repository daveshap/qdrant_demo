AXE: Aw man, Stephen, listen to me...
STEPHEN: -- What the fuck were you thinking, huh? Burning people? You're a fireman.
AXE: They were killing firemen, man. When Sally showed me what was in Swayzak's files... They were my friends, I had to do it. I had to do it for the department.
BRIAN: Did you do it for Tim?
AXE: That was an accident! Jesus Christ, why did you have to go in there so fucking early? Why didn't you listen to me!
AXE: You gotta let me finish --
BRIAN: Just come down, John. Just --
AXE: -- Shut up! Your dad would fucking puke if he saw how you've shit on his department!
STEPHEN: -- Knock it off!
AXE: -- You can't let him turn you against your friends, man --
BRIAN: -- He killed people --
AXE: -- You know what Swayzak would do to the department if this got out? --
BRIAN: -- Stephen, this is bullshit --
AXE: -- What he would do to your dad's department? You gotta let me finish it --
BRIAN: You're his Lt., Stephen... Are you gonna handle it? Are you Stephen?
STEPHEN: Shut up!
AXE: ...What do you want me to do, Stephen? Talk to me. What am I supposed to do?
STEPHEN: There's a fire. We've got a job here. Let's get on with it.
