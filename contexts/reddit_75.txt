a girl said she liked me, but i don’t like girls
i (13f) received a text message while i was on vacation from a fairly(?) recent friend of mine, that was extremely long, detailing how she had a crush on me and stuff. she came out to me towards the end of the year and i was supportive, and so were all of our other friends. so it’s the first week of july, and i’ve been friends with this girl since the end of may. so i thought she hated me because i spent an entire dance with my close friend since grade primary, and she had a crush on him. somehow we ended up friends. at the time she texted me, i was running out of data, but was on wifi. i texted some other friends and she had become almost obsessive... like being bi and having a crush on me was her entire personality. she went to the movies with a group of girls featuring my best friend and asked all of them if they had gotten a text from me, and told them she liked me... yikes. so i ran out of data and didn’t have wifi for the next few weeks. when i got home i told myself i would text her, and made drafts in notes, but i never sent them. i didn’t know what to say, i barely knew this girl. she even forced other people to tell me to text me back. at the beginning of the school year she wouldn’t even look at me, and made other people come up to me to force her to talk to me. now she’s always looking at me awkwardly and idk what to do. we weren’t even close in the first place so i’m rlly confused. idc if no one responds, i just need to rant.
