How should the world deal with North Korea?
At the beginning of July, North Korea [test fired an ICBM](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/04/world/asia/north-korea-missile-test-icbm.html?mcubz=0) making North Korea a global threat where it had previously been contained to being a regional threat. 

The reclusive state has been a foreign policy problem for the USA since the end of the Korean War in the 1950's and more so since the end of the Cold when the North Koreans began their pursuit of nuclear weapons. Presidents from Bill Clinton to Barack Obama tried different approaches to deal with them, such as diplomatic engagement, labeling it a state sponsor of terror, or simply ignoring it in hopes that the regime would collapse on its own. None of those approaches worked 

Inter-continental nuclear capability changes the nature and scale of the threat that North Korea Poses. [An article in the latest edition of the Atlantic lays out 4 broad options for dealing with North Korea](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/07/the-worst-problem-on-earth/528717/) 
> 1. Prevention: A crushing U.S. military strike to eliminate Pyongyang’s arsenals of mass destruction, take out its leadership, and destroy its military. 
> 2. Turning the screws: A limited conventional military attack—or more likely a continuing series of such attacks—using aerial and naval assets, and possibly including narrowly targeted Special Forces operations. 
> 3. Decapitation: Removing Kim and his inner circle, most likely by assassination, and replacing the leadership with a more moderate regime
> 4. Acceptance: The hardest pill to swallow—acquiescing to Kim’s developing the weapons he wants while continuing efforts to contain his ambition.

As the article stresses, none of these options are particularly attractive. Which leads to my question(s), how should the world deal with North Korea?
