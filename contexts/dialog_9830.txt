FORD: Ouch... Of course I want off the case. Some monster from Woodstock tried and succeeded in killing me tonight. The fact I'm alive's a technicality.
COLLEEN: So you...
FORD: Listen, Queen Collie, I have a code. I never, ever, drop a case. Besides, I, uh, used all your money to pay my bills, so I kinda owe you.
COLLEEN: Nonsense. After what you've been through, it sounds like I owe you.
FORD: They did one of these about my ex- wife. It's called 'The Nutcracker.' 'The Nut-crack-er'... I don't need money. I need some questions answered.
COLLEEN: I'll do my best.
FORD: Question one: Can I have some money? Kidding. Why didn't you tell me about you and Johnny? You two were into something even more dangerous than sex, weren't you? Who? What? Where? How? Now.
COLLEEN: Jonathan was such a beautiful man. No one knew him like I did... Excuse me. I can't do this now. I'll call you tomorrow.
FORD: Thanks for the information. Appreciate it.
