OSBORNE: This is the straight hitting on me you were talking about, isn't it?
HARDY: The very same.
OSBORNE: You do understand that there's absolutely no way I could ever be attracted to you, right?
HARDY: I plan to grow on you.
OSBORNE: You're off to a late start.
HARDY: So noted.
HARDY: You guys really got the shit kicked out of you here.
OSBORNE: Imagine what it must have been like for them out there. What do you think of Dunbar?
HARDY: He's telling the truth, up to a point.
OSBORNE: What point?
OSBORNE: Something wrong?
HARDY: Being back here. Gives me the willies.
OSBORNE: Not the happiest of memories?
