WITWER: At least now you -- and I -- have the chance to make sure that kind of thing doesn't happen to anyone ever again.
ANDERTON: Why don't you cut the cute act, Danny, and tell me exactly what it is you're looking for?
WITWER: Flaws.
ANDERTON: There hasn't been a murder in six years. There's nothing wrong with the system. It's perfect.
WITWER: I agree. The system is perfect. If there's a flaw, it's human. It always is. Thank you for the tour, Wally.
