BRETT: Where have you been hiding?
SALLY: Oh--hello! I got the flowers. That was sweet of you--thank you.
BRETT: Don't thank me. Do you recognize me without the lipstick?
SALLY: So you washed it off!
BRETT: How about giving me another coat?
SALLY: Good-by.
BRETT: Wait a minute!--They're dancing in the palm court--
SALLY: Good-by!
BRETT: There's soft music--
SALLY: --sorry--got an appointment to play shuffle-board.
BRETT: Have we?--Well, I'd just as soon play shuffle-board.
DAN: Hello, Denby!
DENBY: I thought I put you to bed.
DAN: Oh, was that me you put to bed? Thanks. I've been looking all over for you.
DENBY: Well, did you find me?
DAN: Not yet. Say, where is this boat headed for?
DENBY: This is a fine time to be asking that. You're on your way to France.
DAN: That's news to me. I'd better cable my wife.
DENBY: Hey, boy--give this man a cablegram blank. Where is your wife?
DAN: She's in New York.
SHORTIE: Here you are, sir.
DAN: What'll I say?
DENBY: Tell her you're on your way to France and will be back in four weeks.
DAN: That's fine.
