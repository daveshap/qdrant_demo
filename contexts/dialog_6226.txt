PEE: D'you think we should do something?
EM: Would you like me to make you a nice cup of tea, son?
ALEX: No thanks, Mum. It'll pass in a minute... ... What have you done with all my own personal things?
PEE: Well. That was all took away, son, by the Police. New regulation about compensation for the victim.
ALEX: What about Basil? Where's my snake?
PEE: Oh well, he met with like an accident. He passed away. Alex becomes a bit weepy.
ALEX: What's gonna happen to me then? I mean that's my room he's in - there's no denying that. This is my home also. What suggestions have you, my Pee and Em, to make?
PEE: Well, all this needs thinking about, son. I mean we can't very well just kick Joe out... Not just like that, can we? I mean Joe is here doing a job. A contract it is, two years. Well, we made like an arrangement, didn't we Joe? You see, son, Joe's paid next month's rent already so, well, whatever we do in the future, we cant just say to Joe to get out, now can we?
