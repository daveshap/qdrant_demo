If you have a bachelors degree, you can get a job as an online English teacher
A lot of people don't realize that this is an option! It's an option even if you do not have formal teaching experience. Keep in mind that as you are teaching English, you're probably teaching students in Asia. So, your hours will be skewed from the normal 9am - 5pm. But hey, money is money! And if anything, this can be a second job if you already have one. 

Teaching online has helped me get back on my feet and start paying off my bills. Depending on the company you work for and your experience, you can make 14-26 dollars an hour. 

Just some food for thought!

Edit:

Just realized you might not need a degree for QKids. Enrollment in school could be sufficient. Worth a try.
