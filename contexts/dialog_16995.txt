ATHOS: Who is he, Aramis?
ARAMIS: Tomorrow.
ATHOS: Tonight! Right now! We steal a man from a royal prison, we hide in a country chateau among an assortment of saints and sluts such as only you could provide, and still you wish to tell me nothing?!
ARAMIS: You seek facts, when it would be better to seek truth.
ATHOS: You are not my priest, Aramis! You would not be, even if I had one.
ARAMIS: You are bitter, Athos. You are torn by grief, not only for Raoul, but for d'Artagnan, whom you love, and now treat as an enemy.
ATHOS: He who is not with us is against us.
ARAMIS: Those are the words of a broken spirit. My spirit is whole. I have trusted d'Artagnan with my deepest secrets, and I will never believe he is my enemy.
ATHOS: Then you are a fool -- a fool who has never lost a son. What gives you the right to judge me, to play God with the lives of others? Is it because you are so much holier than everyone else?!
ARAMIS: There is that, of course -- but mainly it is because I am so much smarter than everyone else.
