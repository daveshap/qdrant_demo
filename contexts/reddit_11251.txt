Went to see a GP about depression, he told I'd get over it because I'm young
It's long term and comes and goes, and I've tentatively narrowed it down to either seasonal affective depression or dysthymia.

I feel like I've hit an all-time low right now. I have strong doubts to the quality of my future and post-graduate opportunities (if there even are any, given the glorious state of our economy right now), and then there's just the strong feelings of inadequacy and loneliness where I wonder why I'm still trying.

For background info: I thought I was doing better this year; concentrating on final year at university, surrounded by a good group of friends, working up the courage to quit the part-time job I hate. But then all of the negativity just hits me again, and it's just dragging me down slowly. I'd say objectively I have a good life, but this is something that's hard for me to bring up to my friends when they're under the impression I'm well-adjusted and happy. Because I'm not. But it's so much easier to fly under the radar with a smile on your face. And when I am genuinely and inexplicably sad, I get dismissed as moody, because there is no easy way to describe why I feel so pathetic and doubtful in my own abilities, and how the sense of uselessness is so crushing. 

I need validation in my own existence. I know what I need is someone to love me but I'm so far into the friend-zone I don't even get signal. I've tried, but maybe I should just pledge abstinence. It's not like I'll be missing out on any.

I just need to know that I'm not alone in feeling like a shitty human being.
