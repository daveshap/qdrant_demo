Is learning coding/programming as useful as it proves to be?
I keep seeing posts about learning how to code and program and wonder if it's as useful as these posts make it seem. I have in interest in learning different things and I don't mind learning how to do this type of thing, but it is really as much of a useful skill as it seems. Is it really a highly sought after/employable skill?

Like I said, I don't mind putting in the time and effort to learn it and see if it's something I'm interested in and can do for a (short term) living and job, but I am also curious on the demand for someone with that type of a skill set.

If it IS an in demand skill set, what can you do with it and what should I be doing to help myself learn it better and come off as employable? I know I'm going in blind, so any help would be useful.
