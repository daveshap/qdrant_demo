Being absolutely spammed by recruiters when a new job req drops - what's going on?
This is now the third time this has happened. A job req goes live (I'm in web development). It is usually for something for the website of a state or city, and for the next 2-4 days, my phone is ringing off the hook. I'm talking sometimes the same number will call me 4-5 times in a row. Typically, these recruiters are foreign, and sometimes I'll get multiple recruiters from the same company contacting me! What is going on? It feels massively unprofessional and is super annoying to boot.
