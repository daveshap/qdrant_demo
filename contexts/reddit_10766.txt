From the SW Mod team: Please be cautious if your post references political events
Please be aware that there's a risk of trolling in response to posts mentioning politics. We are allowing posts of this nature from individuals in sincere distress because we know that the political climate can impact our emotions, worldview, and hopes for the future.  But we also encourage you to consider carefully whether you might feel comfortable reaching out to another source of support, such as one of the [hotlines in our international directory](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/hotlines).  You might also want to have a look at [these resources for helping those struggling with thoughts of suicide](http://redd.it/1c3p3z).  

We are taking all possible steps to prevent abuse, but if you receive any kind of trolling or guideline-breaking response to a post or comment you've made here, whether it mentions politics in any way or not, please let us know and we'll be on it as soon as we can.  

We have been and still are working closely with the reddit admins to ensure that anyone who abuses vulnerable people here is dealt with, not just at the subreddit level.  

Edit:  Added direct links to resources & clarified wording.
