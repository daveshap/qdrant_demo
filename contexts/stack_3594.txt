Is it possible to verifiably timestamp a video? I am wondering if there is a way to timestamp a video. (e.g. Security camera footage)I know that there is a way to timestamp a document with a trusted time authority, and it will certainly be possible to cut the video, send it to a time authority and get it timestamped. But it won't ensure that the footage is exactly from a specific time.Could there be any trust-able methods to timestamp the video while it's being recorded, so that there will be a method to verify that the exact frame of a video footage is from exactly that time?
