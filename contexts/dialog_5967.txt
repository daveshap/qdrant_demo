CANDY: What are you so crazy about the movies for?
HOMER: It was my favorite night at the orphanage--movie night. We'd race into the dining hall. Of course everyone wanted to sit in front, so we'd be packed in so tight you could feel the kid next to you breathing.
CANDY: At least you were never lonely.
HOMER: I didn't say that. Growing up in an orphanage, you're always lonely. You're just never alone.
