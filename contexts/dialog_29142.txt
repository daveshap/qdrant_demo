BOND: Why don't we just take these -
SIDNEY: No. I want Sir Elliot to keep them.
HARMSWAY: ...Well! I do believe this requires further investigation!
SIDNEY: Thank you, Uncle Elliot.
HARMSWAY: No matter what the British government says, I won't kill this story. Miss Oxford will show both of you to the elevator... And one of my people will definitely be in touch sooner than later.
BOND: I'm sure they will.
HARMSWAY: Good-bye, Mister Bond.
