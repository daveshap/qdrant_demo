How do I aggregate percentiles from previously aggregated percentiles? I have previously aggregated data for every 5 minutes with a count of sensors at that location and 5% percentiles of a value of interest: 5th, 10th, ..., 90th, 95th. A sensor can have multiple observations in that 5 minute period, or it can have noneI want to aggregate these data up further and calculate the same percentiles. How can I do so?My thought was to treat the percentiles as observations and assign them a weight of 21 / c_t, where 21 is the number of percentiles at time t and c_t is the count at t. I would then calculate a weighted percentile from there.
