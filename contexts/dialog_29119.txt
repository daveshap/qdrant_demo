MINISTER JOHNSTONE: At least we know where the gold is. When are the recovery ships due?
ADMIRAL ROEBUCK: 36 hours. They've already sailed from the Persian gulf.
MINISTER JOHNSTONE: I expect to have that gold recovered in 36 hours. Until then, I'm imposing my own electronic silence: For the sake of the economy, not a word to NATO, the press, the CIA. ...And so long as Commander Bond here seems to be such an expert on these matters, I want him to go along as an observer. Are we agreed?
