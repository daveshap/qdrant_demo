HAGEN: He's his own boss, and very competent.
DON CORLEONE: And with prison record.
HAGEN: Two terms; one in Italy, one in the United States. He's known to the Government as a top narcotics man. That could be a plus for us; he could never get immunity to testify.
DON CORLEONE: When did he call?
HAGEN: This morning.
DON CORLEONE: On a day like this. Consiglero, do you also have in your notes the the Turk made his living from Prostitution before the war, like the Tattaglias do now. Write that down before you forget it. The Turk will wait.
