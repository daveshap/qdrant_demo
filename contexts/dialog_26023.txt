TICK: Don't have a fucking coronary, Lenny.
LENNY: Well you could've at least warned me. You know I hate the zap... when they die. It just brings down your whole day. Jeez, Tick.
TICK: Sorry.
LENNY: How'd you get the tape? Why didn't the cops put it in evidence?
TICK: With all the blood I guess they didn't see the rig. Guy had it under a wig.
LENNY: Yeah, but how'd it get to you?
TICK: I got ways, Lenny, I got ways. Okay, okay... I got a deal with some a the paramedics. My guy pages me and I pick it up at the morgue. So whaddya think? This clip's gotta be worth at least a grand. Right?
LENNY: Tick. Not to dash your hopes, but I don't deal this kind of product, you know that. I'll give you four for it, cause I've gotta cut off the last bit. And my customers want uncut.
TICK: Fuck that! The last part's the best. You dry-dive six stories and blammo! Jack right into the Big Black.
LENNY: I don't deal black-jack clips! It's policy. I got ethics here.
TICK: Yeah, when did that start? Come on, man! It's what people want to see, and you know it.
LENNY: So lay it off to somebody else.
TICK: Come on, Lenny. I got expenses. I got to get this rig fixed. Look at it...
TICK: Give me six at least. This's a good clip, here. Gets you pumpin'.
LENNY: Yeah, well, the first part's okay. Better than the usual soaps you bring me.
TICK: Now that is cold, Lenny. I always bring you choice.
LENNY: Sure, like this low-grade shit here, some girl in a fight with her boyfriend... it's a test-pattern. Nothing happens. I'm snorin'.
TICK: Hey, you're always saying, 'Bring me real life. Bring me street life. And, like, one man's mundane and desperate existence is another man's Technicolor.'
LENNY: I said that? Look, I'll take it for five, and you'll make out okay, because in this case it's pure cream, you don't have to cut anything back to the wearer.
TICK: Ha! That's for fucking sure.
LENNY: What else you got?
