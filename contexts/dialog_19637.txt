NEIL: I'm glad things have worked out for you.
KRISTEN: I think new York was just what I needed. So many people. I never feel alone.
NEIL: The city that never sleeps. So what will you do now?
KRISTEN: I don't know. I'm busy with school. New friends. But I'll never forget the old ones.
NEIL: To old friends. And your new dreams.
KRISTEN: To old friends.
NEIL: It was great seeing you again. I'm glad you dropped by.
KRISTEN: Do you still...see each other?
NEIL: Yes. I'm going to see her tonight.
