HILDY: Hildy Johnson... Oh, hello, Bruce. Have you got it? Is it certified?
BRUCE: Certified and everything. Got it right here in my wallet... What? No, he's not here -- I'm in a phone booth.
MCCUE: Certified, eh? Who is it -- your milkman?
HILDY: But, Bruce, don't keep it in your wallet!... Well, you see -- -- there's an old newspaper superstition that the first big check you get you -- you put in the lining of your hat. That brings you good luck for ten years.
MCCUE: Say, I've been a reporter twenty years and never heard any hooey like that. Where'd you get it?
HILDY: I made it up just now, and who's asking you? I know it's silly, honey, but do it for me, won't you?... Yes, right now.
