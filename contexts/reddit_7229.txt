My cash drawer was short, how do I NOT do this I'm the future?
I'm at a brand new job, it was my 2nd day. At the end of the day my cash drawer was short by less than a dollar. I didn't get in trouble or anything, I just don't want this to happen again. Im pretty sure I was counting the correct change, so I'm not sure what I did wrong, if anybody has an advice it would be greatly appreciated, like tips or tricks.
