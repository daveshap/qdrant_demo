I'm 28 and never dated. Where's the tutorial level?!?
As the title states, I'm 28 going on 29 and dating was never really a part of my life as I tended to fall for girls who never reciprocated those feelings when I was much much younger. I stopped trying altogether when I left for college and I've gotten so used to being alone that I couldn't imagine myself wanting to be with someone else because being single felt so freeing. I thought I was happy on my own with my solitude.

This quarantine has proved that theory wrong in every way possible.

I know now that I WANT to be with someone, but I have exactly zero idea of how to actually make that happen.  This is further not helped by the fact that I'm a bigger guy with little confidence in most things, let alone dating. So any advice on what I can at least be doing to get started so I don't walk into instant failure would be more helpful than words can express.
