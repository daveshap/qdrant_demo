Does a business associates count for anything?
I just dropped out of a 4 year program with 2 years to go due to severe burn out. I just discovered though, with two more basic classes, I could have an associate degree in business. No other degrees, my prior jobs have been retail and food service, and my current job is administrative assistant. The two classes would cost me about $1500 including books. Would this be a worthy investment? I realize it's not much, but is it better than nothing? I'm in my late 20s and trying to plan for my long term future. Thank you!
