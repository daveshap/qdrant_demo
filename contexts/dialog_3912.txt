LEVY: According to Caltech, this Webber guy was a bonafide genius and a borderline nutcase.
ATKINSON: Well, he and Mrs. Nutcase must have been out here when the plane hit.
LEVY: Unless we get a postcard or somethin', that's my guess.
ATKINSON: What about relatives?
LEVY: All back East.
ATKINSON: The neighbors over there said the guy spent day and night out here. She'd bring him sandwiches and hot Dr. Pepper.
LEVY: He drank it hot?
ATKINSON: Yeah.
LEVY: Good god.
ATKINSON: Yeah.
CALVIN: Hi, honey! Feeling better?
HELEN: No.
CALVIN: We have to be strong, sweetheart. If not for ourselves, for the child.
HELEN: All our friends...
CALVIN: Burnt to a crisp. I've given you the most well-done cut.
HELEN: I'm not hungry.
CALVIN: Hot Dr. Pepper! Your favorite!
HELEN: No, Calvin, you're favorite.
CALVIN: Really?
