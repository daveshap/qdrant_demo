SAILOR: Life is a bitch and then you marry one.
LULA: What kinda trash talk is that?
SAILOR: What it says on the bumper sticker up front. On that pickup.
LULA: That's disgustin'. Those kinda sentiments shouldn't be allowed out in public. Is this Biloxi yet?
SAILOR: Almost. I figure we should find us a place to stay and then go eat.
LULA: Got anyplace special in mind?
SAILOR: We oughta stay somewhere outta the way. Not in no Holidays or Ramadas or Motel Six. If Johnnie Farragut's on our trail he'll check those first.
