twiddling my thumbs
Hey r/GradSchool. All the defense posts have been great to see lately. I wish I had one of my own to share. Instead, I'm sitting here waiting to see what my committee chair has to say about my data and conclusions chapters. Waiting for feedback has repeatedly been the most agonizing part of the past year-plus; my chair takes forever to get anything back. I realized too late the entire process would consist of handing him a chapter, hearing nothing for weeks, only to follow-up to get a few comments and then send an updated draft to the rest of the committee to get truly reviewed. I'm trying not to get too impatient right now, everyone's dealing with their own shit. But he's been close to the most worthless chair ever, if you know a good way to passive aggressively call this out in an acknowledgements section add it in the comments.  

This time I thought I'd head off the process a little by sending the whole committee my last two chapters at once. So now instead of just me waiting to hear feedback everyone is waiting to send their review until they hear from the chair. Not awesome! 

He's had these chapters for about three weeks now. I've managed to be a little productive in that time; put some slides together thinking I'll have a zoom defense, edited the first three chapters for the first time in months to clean them up. But I think I'm about out of things to do except drink, so that's what I'm going to do next. Happy Friday reddit, I'm going to go visit r/whiskey.
