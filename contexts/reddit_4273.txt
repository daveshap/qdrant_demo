I had my first kiss last night
I’m 16f, and have been asked out a handful of times I guess but I haven’t really been interested in anyone. I reconnected with a boy I was friends with and we went out to the movies, and last night went to a park. Had a good makeout sesh in his car :) I’m buzzing now thinking about it and we’re going out today for lunch. So excited for the future!
