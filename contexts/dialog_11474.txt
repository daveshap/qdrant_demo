GRUSINSKAYA: What?
BARON: The veronal -- you. I'm going to stay here with you.
GRUSINSKAYA: I want to be alone.
BARON: That is not the truth. You do not want to be alone -- you're afraid of being alone -- I know you're afraid. I know you. You were desperate, just now, if I go away you'll be more desperate than ever. Say I am to stay with you... say it.
