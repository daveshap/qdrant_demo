SWAYZAK: When are you going to catch the prick that's doing this, Don?
SHADOW: Don?""
SWAYZAK: Don't you have any leads at all?
SHADOW: No Marty, I don't.
SHADOW: We still haven't found a connection between the victims.
SWAYZAK: Jesus, open your eyes! Seagrave, Cosgrove, and now Holcomb -- fried in a goddamn high-rise!
SHADOW: Holcomb? I didn't know the name of that victim had even been released yet.
SHADOW: Is there a connection between them, Alderman?
SWAYZAK: Just catch the son of a bitch.
SHADOW: What the hell are you doing here?
BRIAN: I'm finished with Swayzak. I'll do whatever you want me to do. I just want to help catch the guy that burned Tim. You gotta give me another shot.
