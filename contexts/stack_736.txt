Dual-boot over two hard drives I have a Laptop with an SSD and an HDD. It came with Windows installed on SSD and since it is small, I added a HDD to store all my files and install all my games. I would like to install Ubuntu on a part of the HDD (without losing all the data on it. I have about 300GB free and can create an empty partition by \"shrinking\" the corresponding D: drive, so that should not be a problem) and want to keep using Windows as well as Ubuntu. I have seen several tutorials and questions about installing dual-booting Ubuntu and Windows, but all of them assumed they were installed on same disc. Is something different when it comes to installing Ubuntu on a different hard drive, will it still work and what are the possible problems and solutions?
