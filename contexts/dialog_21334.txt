UTAH: No, but there are four guys back there you might check out.
PAPPAS: Thanks, buddy.
UTAH: Friends of yours, huh?
BODHI: The one you decked is Bunker Wiess. The big one is his brother, Warchild. The other two always hang. They think they're some kinda death squad around here.
UTAH: What's their program?
BODHI: They're punks. Nazis. Their brains are wired wrong. They hurt surfing because they give nothing back, and they have no respect for the sea. They just want to get radical. It's mindless aggression. They'll never get it, the spiritual side of it.
UTAH: You always talk like this? You're not gonna start chanting or anything are you?
BODHI: No. So I was up the beach. I saw it going down. you didn't hesitate... they never backed you up an inch. That's rare in this world.
UTAH: Thanks for stepping in.
BODHI: De nada.
UTAH: Gonna be some people at my house tonight. Maybe you can make it.
UTAH: Where?
BODHI: Come with Tyler. She knows.
