OWEN: And Cecelia, how is she? Where is she tonight?
BATEMAN: Cecelia is, well...you know
OWEN: Evelyn. Great ass. Goes out with that loser Patrick Bateman. What a dork.
BATEMAN: Another Martini, Paul?
BATEMAN: Paul, give me your Amex card. Good boy. Bateman slaps the card down, looks at the check.
BATEMAN: Two-hundred-and-fifty. Very reasonable. Let's leave a big tip, shall we? My place hr a nightcap?
OWEN: No, man. I'm gonna bail.
BATEMAN: Come on, you dumb son of a bitch. I've got a preview of the Barneys catalogue and a bottle of Absolut waiting for us.
