Should I continue with online education after receiving my BS?
I'm wondering if it's worth the time to continue my education with EGCC, an online community college.  I have a bachelor's degree from Texas A&M in Tech Management and minoring in Business. The reason I am now studying at EGCC is it is a free benefit from my mother's union job that family members may use. There are several free business associate's degrees I can get and am currently working on one. Each one should take 1 to 1 & 1/2 years to complete. I imagine the longer I stay the less time it will take to get each degree as they likely use some of the same courses. The classes typically aren't that difficult as it tends to just be a lot of writing. So it's free and takes up some time on my weekends.

The reason I'm posting this is I hear a lot of bad stuff about online schools and how employers will completely disregard them on a resume. I'm wondering if it is worth my time with these degrees. Since I already have the bachelor's I was thinking the extra degrees would at the very least show a willingness to learn/better myself. And like I said it's very little investment on my part. I would still like to get your opinions and any experience you have with the subject. Thanks!
