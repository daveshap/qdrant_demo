When the rain comes, it rains, but it doesn't stay.
Jim Carrey told inews, “At this point, I don’t have depression. There is not an experience of depression. I had that for years, but now, when the rain comes, it rains, but it doesn’t stay. It doesn’t stay long enough to immerse me and drown me anymore.”

People with depression have a hard time separating their thoughts from reality; they can often fall victim to black and white thinking. This means that they view everything as all good or all bad, and can’t see any grey area. However, if you detach yourself from your ego and simply view all of life as an experience, it can help you move through your journey on Earth in a more fluid way.
