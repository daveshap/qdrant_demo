It of state resume follow up [bos to phx]
Currently I live in Massachusetts but I'm looking to relocate to the Phoenix area. 

In my field (construction) I have experience, but I haven't heard back from any submitted applications. The one I DID hear back from one, it was because I called to follow up. That landed me an interview. Unfortunately the particular job area I applied for isnt as strong there as it is here.. would've had the job but terrible pay.

Knowing this, I've slightly changed the areas I apply too, still equally qualified for. Back to hearing nothing.

After searching thru older threads I've seen a split some say, dont contact at all, some say only after an interview, some say always follow up to separate yourself.

I do know that when I called on that previous offer, they had trouble finding my application at first. Then noted a sorting system used to help weed through resumes, and that it more than likely picked up on my location and deemed me not suited for the position.

Am I to believe there is no solid right or wrong when it comes to follow up etiquette? However, when it comes to people in my position, it's important to follow up? 

Thanks
