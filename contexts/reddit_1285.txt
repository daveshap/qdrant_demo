Does anyone else feel like a psycho while having conversation with yourself in your mind?
I was just recalling my past and having long conversation with myself in my mind as usual, sarcastically speaking and dark humour made me laugh and I felt like a psycho tbh.

Edit; thank you, yall! It really gives me relief knowing I'm not alone and that it's normal. I mean, I knew it's normal thing to do but I just couldn't help but doubt myself sometimes. ðŸ˜…
