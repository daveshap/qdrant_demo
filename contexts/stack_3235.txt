Duo of alien xenologists study couple of Terran explorers, later save them I once read a SF short story in the 80's, but I can't remember either the name nor the author. The protagonists are two alien anthropologists (one shaped like a tiger, the other like a dragon, I think) intent  on secretly studying two Terran explorers. The Terrans (dubbed \"the big one\" and \"the small one\") we soon learn are a couple and at one point they get in some kind of danger.The two alien anthropologists decide to save them and manage to do so without revealing themselves, thus also \"saving\" their study.
