VL53L0x Array, Sensor Sync with I2C I'm working on an array of VL53L0x by ST, composed of 15 sensors.I'm using a polling policy to read the measurements coming from the Array, and each sensor in set to Continue Ranging mode and in HighSpeedMode (nominal 20ms per reading).My problem is that when i read the array it takes like half a second to read it all, when the speed I aspected was 20ms since the sensors can work in parallel.I call the GetMesurament() for each Sensors and, at the end, I wait for 20ms.The measurement when i call the function must be ready, because of the continuous ranging and because I've waited for 20ms since the last time i asked for measurement. Instead it looks like I've to wait for each sensors to be ready.I've forgotten something particular in the setting part? there is a right call procedure to do what i want?
