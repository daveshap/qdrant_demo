Ask a girl to the dance and date her?
Hey I'm new to reddit so please excuse my lack of proper etiquette but I need some help.

So I am more of an extrovert but there is a really cute girl I like and want to take her to our sweethearts dance. She is an introvert and is very shy and doesnt really have a large group of friends. What is the best way to ask her to the dance and ask her to be my girlfriend in the same night, without making her feel overwhelmed?

Thanks
