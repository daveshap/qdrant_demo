MARYLIN: Getting married.
MILES: To him? He's a sick freak.
MARYLIN: He's passionate.
MILES: Passionate! He's a pervert. He should have to register when he moves.
MARYLIN: All girls enjoy a little rough trade from time to time.
MILES: Marylin! Listen to me.
MARYLIN: No. You listen to me. You busted me, Miles. You left me with nothing! What did you expect me to do? Get a degree in counseling? Write a book about table linen? Because that's what wives do when they get dumped, and frankly, I'm not quite ready for that.
MILES: But why him?
MARYLIN: We told you. We realized we've always been in love.
MILES: The Massey pre-nup has never been pene -- successfully challenged.
MARYLIN: So I hear. Is that all?
MILES: No, that's not all.
