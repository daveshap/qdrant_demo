MR. KELLY: Your grades for fall semester. They're -- good.
LANDON: You came here to give me my report card?
MR. KELLY: I've seen students with records like yours go to J.C. for a couple of years, then transfer to a good college.
MR. KELLY: I'd gladly write you a letter of recommendation.
LANDON: Thank you.
MR. KELLY: You're welcome.
JAMIE: I can't believe you asked my father's permission.
LANDON: I wanted this to be a date.
JAMIE: Is there a rush?
LANDON: I have to get you home by one.
JAMIE: It's only 7:30.
LANDON: We're going somewhere. After. And no. I didn't ask your father.
LANDON: Your turn.
JAMIE: No.
LANDON: I know you want to.
