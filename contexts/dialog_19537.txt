LT THOMPSON: Decide to take a day off after all?
NANCY: Dad, I want to see Rod Lane.
LT THOMPSON: Only family allowed, Nancy. You know the drill.
NANCY: Just want to talk to him a second.
LT THOMPSON: He's dangerous.
NANCY: You don't know he did it.
LT THOMPSON: No, I know, thanks to your own testimony, that he was locked in a room with a girl who went in alive and came out in a rubber bag.
