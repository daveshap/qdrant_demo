Am I screwed for the next (1? 2?) years as a single person due to corona?
I’m looking for a serious relationships. I don’t like dating apps and I’m convinced that it’s tough to find a guy who wants anything serious on there. Plus I’m not super attracted to anyone I’ve seen on the dating apps. I’ve never been in a serious relationship due to wanting to focus on school,  but now I’m getting lonely. The best “relationships” I’ve had (no matter how short lived they were) were with people I met in real life. Do you think i should throw in the towel and consider myself single for however long corona is around?  Am I doomed for the next year or two? Does anyone have any success stories of meeting your SO during corona? Brownie points if you met them outside of a dating app.
