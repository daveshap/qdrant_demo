BLIND MAN: Ain't over yet. Night is part of day; separate, but equal. Night is when you let your guard down; when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark.
BOBBY: Difference between you and me, old man, is I see the glass half full, you see it half empty.
BLIND MAN: Night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'. It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of.
BOBBY: You afraid of the dark?
BLIND MAN: Afraid of it? Boy, I live in the dark. All cause of a woman who made me this way. People are afraid of what they can't see. I can't see nuthin', so it's all the same to me. Kiss from a beautiful woman, kissy kissy kiss, a lick from a dog, slurp, slurp, the kiss of death . It's all the same to me.
BOBBY: So, we're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride. Is that it?
BLIND MAN: More or less.
BOBBY: Not this twig, friend. I got plans.
BLIND MAN: Nothing makes the Great Spirit laugh harder than a man's plans. We all got plans. I planned on seeing all my life. I know you didn't plan on straying into town.
BOBBY: No and I don't plan on sticking around either.
BLIND MAN: Well, don't say I didn't warn you when things go your way.
BOBBY: You got a lotta philosophy in you, old timer but you don't fool me for one second with all this blind man crap. One minute you lost your eyes in Vietnam, next it's the joint. Now it's a woman? I'm hep to you.
