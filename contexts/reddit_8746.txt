To what degree does the United States' Senate represent the states as sovereign political entities?
The United States' federal government is a [bicameral legislature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress) with a House of Representatives and Senate.  Before the [Seventeenth Amendment](https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendments/amendment-xvii) was ratified in 1912, Senators weren't directly elected; instead, State legislatures appointed two Senators for six year terms each. George Mason, one of the original founders, argued that ["...state legislative solutions gave states the power of self-defense against the federal government."](https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendments/amendment-xvii) Wendell Pierce held a different view, arguing that ["...the contrast between a state legislatively-appointed Senate and a popularly elected House would increase the types of interests represented in the federal government. By requiring the consent of two different constituencies in the House and the state legislatures in the Senate-- the composition of the Senate was seen as essential to the system of bicameralism, which would require 'the concurrence of two distinct bodies in schemes of usurpation or perfidy'."](https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendments/amendment-xvii)

Contrast this with the German [Bundesrat](https://www.bundesrat.de/EN/organisation-en/organisation-en-node.html). According to the [*German Basic Law (Article 51)](https://www.bundesrat.de/EN/funktionen-en/go-en/go-en-node.html) Rather than two representatives with six year terms per person inhabiting the institution, the state governments send delegations of representatives that act in the will of the composition of that state, ensuring indirect majority-rule from the bottom-up. Each delegation receives votes based on the population of their state; ["Länder (State governments) with more than two million inhabitants shall have four, Länder with more than six million inhabitants five, and Länder with more than seven million inhabitants six votes."](https://www.bundesrat.de/EN/funktionen-en/go-en/go-en-node.html) Most German states use some variation of proportional representation for their electoral systems, so representatives tend to represent more than [two political parties at once](https://www.bundesrat.de/SharedDocs/bilder/EN/artikel/zusammensetzung.jpg?__blob=panorama&v=23).  They're subject to [recall](http://www.senat.fr/senatsdumonde/english/germanyenglish.html) at any time by the state government, whereas U.S Senators [are not](https://www.dailysignal.com/2010/02/02/can-u-s-senators-be-recalled/).  


Is the German system of majority rule in both federal legislative houses conducive to people's liberty or detrimental to the long-term liberty of the people? Does it represent everyone or is it failing in protecting minorities? By and large, do U.S Senators succeed or fail to represent their state, and if they fail, does the German system offer a means by which to achieve success?  Is it possible to reconcile gerrymandering and the two-party system with fair representation in government alongside the goal of Senators to represent the entirety of their state in the federal legislature?

How does one define the representation of a state:  If its the government, does that mean the entire legislative branch of a state is represented or merely the majority?  If it's the people, then does that include everyone, or the constituents who voted for said U.S Senators?
