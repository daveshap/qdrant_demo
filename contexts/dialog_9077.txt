KATE: It’s been interesting, that’s for sure.
JACK: But I’ve done some good things too, haven’t I?
KATE: You’ve been Jack Campbell. And that’s always a good thing...
JACK: I need you to remember me, Kate. How I am right now, right this very moment. I need you to put that image in your heart and keep it with you, no matter what happens.
KATE: Are you okay, Jack?
JACK: Please, just promise me you’ll do that. You have to promise, Kate. Because if you don’t, then it’s like it never happened and I don’t think I could live with that.
KATE: I promise, Jack...
JACK: Promise me again...
KATE: I promise. Come to bed, honey.
