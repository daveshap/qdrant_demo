What are the pros and cons of taxing capital gains as ordinary income?
A [capital gain](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/capital%20gain) is "the increase in value of an asset (such as stock or real estate) between the time it is bought and the time it is sold."

The United States has a system of [marginal progressive income tax,](https://www.pgpf.org/blog/2019/03/how-do-marginal-income-tax-rates-work-and-what-if-we-increased-them) but long-term capital gains (on the sale of assets held for more than a year) are [taxed at lower rates.](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/101515/comparing-longterm-vs-shortterm-capital-gain-tax-rates.asp)

Several Democratic candidates for President ([Booker](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2019/04/17/election-2020-cory-booker-earned-income-tax-credit-workers-pay-iowa-caucus-trillion-democrats/3493619002/), [Delaney](https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1105562902784806913), [Inslee](https://qz.com/1536793/your-guide-to-the-2020-democratic-presidential-candidates/)) have proposed that capital gains should be taxed as ordinary income. 

Was it ever this way? What inspired the idea of taxing capital gains at a different rate in the first place? What are the pros and cons of such a change?
