Let's get some upvotes and pay some respects for all our brothers and sisters still having to write over 20 supplements, apply to 10 more colleges, and stress over the next few months. Lets get to grinding with the January 1st deadline only 16 days away.
As my profile name suggests, LETS-GET-IT!!! I believe in all of you and shrug those rejections and start grinding to acquire that bread! Lets rub this shit in the faces of Harvard, Stanford, Rice, Yale, MIT, Caltech, Northwestern, Princeton, Brown, Duke, all the UCs, Dartmouth, and all them prestigious schools.

They demoralized us? Ha, they thought!! They didn't know we were still gonna be grinding.

In all honesty, lets get this party on the road.
