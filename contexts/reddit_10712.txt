Do you ever want to just fade away?
To fade away like the smoke from a cigarette and no longer trouble myself or others. For all the memories I'm involved in to disappear with me and all traces of my existence gone. That's what I wish for. 

I don't want to have to deal with this mess I've created anymore and I don't want anyone else to have to clean it up after me. Why can't I just disappear? It would be so much easier for all.
