I’m confused about my sexuality. Help?
I’m 16F and I’m having thoughts. Not suicidal ones... but sexual ones. But they aren’t just boy x me, sometimes it’s me and some girls I know. For my whole life I’ve been straight but as of late, I’ve been thinking about kissing this girl in my weightlifting class. She’s really beautiful too. But she’s a bit out of my league. Enough about this.
Now to the point. I don’t know if I’m just curious or I’m actually lesbian or bi. Advice??

Edit: I texted her and got rejected. I’m okay and I’m gonna come out to my family
