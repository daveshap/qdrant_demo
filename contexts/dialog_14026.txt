KARLA: You gotta sell his butt on the Bahamas?
JULIE: Ray, come on. I want us to be together.
RAY: Julie, we're working a big run up here. It's been crazy. We probably have to go out again tonight. I don't think I can do it.
JULIE: Will you try...for me, please?
RAY: Okay, I'll try. But, listen... If I don't make it up, then you go ahead and have a great time.
JULIE: Ray...please try. I really miss you. Okay. Bye.
