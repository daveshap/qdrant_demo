KAYLEIGH: Just shut up, Evan. You're wasting your breath.
EVAN: You can't hate yourself just because your dad's a twisted freak.
KAYLEIGH: Who are you trying to convince, Evan?! You come all the way out here to stir up my shit just because you had a bad memory!? You want me to cry on your shoulder and tell you that everything's all better now? Well fuck you, Evan! Nothing's gonna be all better! Okay?! Nothing ever gets better!
