LOWELL: You believe that?
WIGAND: No.
LOWELL: You should. Because when you're done, a judgment is going to go down in the court of public opinion, my friend. And that's the power you have.
WIGAND: You believe that?
LOWELL: I believe that? Yes, I believe that.
WIGAND: You believe that because you get information out to people... something happens?
LOWELL: Yes.
WIGAND: Maybe that's just what you've been telling yourself all these years to justify having a good job? Having status? And maybe for the audience, it's just voyeurism? Something to do on a Sunday night. And maybe it won't change a fucking thing. And people like myself and my family are left hung out to dry. Used up! Broke, alone!
LOWELL: Are you talking to me or did somebody else just walk in here?! I never abandoned a source!
WIGAND: I don't think you really understand --
LOWELL: No, don't evade a choice you gotta make be questioning my reputation or 60 Minutes'" with this cheap skepticism!"
WIGAND: I have to put my family's welfare on the line here, my friend! And what are you puttin' up? You're puttin' up words!
LOWELL: Words! While you've been dickin' around at fucking company golf tournaments, I been out in the world, giving my word and backing it up with action.
