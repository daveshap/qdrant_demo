SNOW: Was her breakfast conversation that bad?
KELVIN: Shut up.
SNOW: I told you, try to stay calm. You're supposed to be the psychologist of the bunch.
KELVIN: What was it?
SNOW: Personally, I think it's God. At least, it fits my definition.
KELVIN: And professionally?
SNOW: I'm not sure. It started with Gibarian. He locked himself in his room and refused to talk except through a crack in the door. He covered the video lens. Obviously we thought he was having a nervous breakdown. I don't know why he didn't tell us he had somebody in there. By this time, we were getting visitors, too. He was desperately trying to figure it out. Day and night. Who was she?
KELVIN: My wife.
SNOW: Dead?
SNOW: She has materialized from your memory of her. What was her name?
KELVIN: Rheya.
SNOW: It started about three months ago. Right after the government sold the expedition. We were ready to go home.
KELVIN: Will she come back?
SNOW: Probably.
KELVIN: I wish you'd told me.
SNOW: Told you what?
SNOW: What will you say?
KELVIN: To who?
SNOW: What are you going to report back to Earth?
KELVIN: I don't know.
SNOW: An enormous amount of money changed hands to get control of this project. We are in little danger of being left alone for long. You'll need to do something. Otherwise they'll be sending someone out to recover you.
KELVIN: Gibarian said he thinks Solaris should be destroyed.
SNOW: That's ludicrous. This is contact. We have found God. The only issue is figuring out how to prove this in a way that will make sense back on Earth. So how will we describe it, if we choose to describe it at all?
