Can you get a research assistantship in a different department than your MS department?
I got into a MS in Data Science program and the Math&Stats dept that the program is under does not have research/graduate assistantships  for the Data Science students. I would like to either get a PhD in computational science or go into industry as a computational scientist. This summer I am doing research in a biophysics lab at the same university as my MS program doing some computational biology work. Theoretically, if I were able to prove myself a good worker/researcher, would they allocate some funding(idc how much, anything would help) to let me be a researcher during my MS? I know I am getting ahead of myself but I just want to know if this is a possibility.
