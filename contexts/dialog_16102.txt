BRYAN: Listen...maybe I can get you a year.
GEORGE: I hate this job.
BRYAN: What are you talking about? You love your job.
GEORGE: From the day I started...to today. Can't stand it.
BRYAN: Then it sounds like I'm doing you a favor.
GEORGE: It may sound that way, but I react out of fear. My life has nothing to do with what I like or don't like. You haven't been listening, have you?
BRYAN: I didn't know there would be a quiz, George.
GEORGE: For everything.
BRYAN: Well, I feel better about this now.
GEORGE: Good. I was hoping for that.
GEORGE: I've got one favor to ask.
BRYAN: What can I do for you, George?
GEORGE: I built my first model here when I was twenty. There are hundreds of them on shelves around the office. Twenty years of my life. I was wondering if I might be able to pick a few to keep, to take home? Only the ones that really mean something to me.
BRYAN: Oh, well...those are...I mean, we don't get to keep our work. I could maybe ask them if you could choose one. But, you know, frankly George, you were the best. Computer models can't begin to match the beauty you gave yours. They're a part of this firm. They inspire me. I go out there and sometimes just stare at something I've designed. It amazes me. I would miss that too much. Look, I may be going out on a limb, but you go out there and look them over, every single one of them and pick the one you like the best and take it with you. Just run it by me first, just in case, you know...but I'm sure it'll be okay.
GEORGE: Thank you.
BRYAN: Well, it's the least I can do.
GEORGE: Yes, it is.
