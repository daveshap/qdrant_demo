PIERSON: Roy Dillon?
ROY: Yes?
PIERSON: Lieutenant Pierson, Phoenix police. I have a car here.
ROY: Thank you.
PIERSON: I realize this is a shock.
ROY: Well, mostly, I don't believe it.
PIERSON: That's natural.
ROY: No. I mean, I don't believe it. Lilly is not a suicide. I know my mother, nothing would make her check out.
PIERSON: I'm sorry, it was her all right. Her gun, even.
ROY: Gun?
PIERSON: I grant you, it's a little odd, shoot yourself with a gun with a silencer on it, but it was hers, all right. It really is your mother, Mister Dillon.
ROY: It may be Lilly, but it isn't suicide.
PIERSON: Do you have any particular reason to say that?
ROY: My mother... Well, I guess it doesn't matter now. She worked for gamblers. She always knew they might turn on her some day.
PIERSON: A hit, you mean. Honestly, it doesn't have that feel to it, but I'll certainly consider the possibility. Thank you for telling me.
ROY: Not that it matters. This is the morgue?
PIERSON: You up to it now?
ROY: Sure. Let's get it over.
PIERSON: One thing I have to caution you about. A gunshot wound...
ROY: Yes, I know, I know.
PIERSON: Well, uh, you know, she ate the gun.
ROY: What?
PIERSON: I'm sorry, that's an unfortunate phrase, it slipped out, I'm, to tell you the truth, Mr. Dillon, this isn't an everyday occurrence around here.
ROY: Ate the gun. Oh.
PIERSON: Someone who knows her well could still identify her, that's not the problem. It's just there's, uh, it's likely to be a shock.
ROY: Well, let's get the shock over with.
ROY: Not many laughs in this room, eh?
PIERSON: Not many.
