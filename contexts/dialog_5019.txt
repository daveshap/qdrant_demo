MERRICK: It's not pretty, but it does suit our purposes.
BUFFY: Our purposes.
BUFFY: What, um... What do we do?
MERRICK: There's a great deal I have to show you, I'm not even sure where to start There's so little time.
BUFFY: Why do you keep saying that?
MERRICK: Do you know what a Vampire-King is?
BUFFY: A Vampire-King? You mean like Dracula?
MERRICK: Oh, yes. And the man from your dreams. Lothos.
BUFFY: Oh, him.
MERRICK: Yes. They travel about, usually with one or two of their followers to lay the groundwork. The vampires find a community and they feed on it, make it their own. You were difficult to trace, and I think the process has gone a lot further than I'd anticipated. Usually this goads a community into some kind of paranoid frenzy. But for some reason, nobody here seems to be paying any attention.
BUFFY: What?
MERRICK: We'll cover it later.
BUFFY: I still don't get how they happened to come to my town. I mean, was I born here because... because they were coming here? That Lothos guy, and his buddies?
MERRICK: In a way, yes. Your fate is inexorably connected to them.
BUFFY: Great. First I have a birthright, now I've got a fate. Hey, do I have to take notes on this?
MERRICK: We're going to have the work hard. You'll need some excuse for staying out. For your parents.
BUFFY: Not a pressing issue.
MERRICK: I tell you, the best thing I can do right now is find out more about you. What your strengths are, your likes... Everything. What's your best subject?
BUFFY: Uh... gym.
MERRICK: Yes, you used to do gymnastics. But you stopped. Why?
BUFFY: Well, everybody says... it's just kind of dorky. I mean, have you ever seen a gymnast's legs? They're like -- -- the mighty oak. It's not a look.
MERRICK: But you enjoyed it, yes?
BUFFY: Well... I do cheerleading now. It's way cooler.
MERRICK: Cheerleading. For... sporting events, yes?
BUFFY: Sporting events, yeah.
MERRICK: All right. Why don't you show me a cheer?
BUFFY: Here?
MERRICK: Yes, yes. It would be interesting. A nice cheer.
BUFFY: Okay.
BUFFY: Who we gonna beat?
MERRICK: Who we gonna beat?
BUFFY: No -- you don't have to --
MERRICK: Oh. I thought... you lead me --
BUFFY: No. You don't do anything. I do it.
MERRICK: Oh. Good.
