Invitation letter for Romanian tourist visa I am an Indian citizen with US Permanent Residency.I am planning to visit Romania soon just for spending a vacation, however I came to know that Indian citizens need an invitation letter for Romanian tourist visa.I heard in some places that it is not a strict requirement.Also I came to know that persons who belong to the countries that need the invitation letter, if they are permanent residents of Canada, the requirement is waived.I do not need a travel agency for the tour, I was planning to do it alone. Could anyone comment on:i. Is it absolutely necessary to have the invitation letter?ii. Is the requirement waived for a US permanent resident?iii. Is it possible to get a travel package for one day from a travel agency and get an invitation letter?I am going for 7 days, that way I don't have to have buy package for all 7 days.Thank you very much in advance!Argha
