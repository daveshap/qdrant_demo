TOM: I'm not sure I dialed right -- Jane?
JANE: Jane, yes. Tom? Tom, is that you? Is this Tom?
TOM: Yes.
JANE: I had to sleep fast so I took two allergy pills to help me...I'm sorry...Hey, you called me.
TOM: It's not important.
JANE: Says who? Not important -- ha-ha-ha. I was dreaming -- Oh, no -- can't tell -- how embarrassing for me. Gosh.
TOM: What pills did you take? You sound more like someone on a general anesthetic. Maybe I'd better speak to you tomorrow.
JANE: Nooo. Is it your story?
TOM: No. Are you going to the Correspondents' Dinner on Saturday?
JANE: Why, you need me for the story?
TOM: No. Were you going to you?
JANE: Uh-huh.
TOM: Maybe I'll get off work. I'd like to go.
JANE: Oh, good.
TOM: We can go together.
JANE: So you like me, huh?
TOM: I like you as much as I can like anyone who thinks I'm an asshole.
