BABE BROTHER: I have more sense than to give up everything, my family, you and Sunny. It wasn't me, I mean the real me inside my body. I'm glad it's over. It's like a veil has been lifted.
LINDA: Like a veil has been lifted?
BABE BROTHER: It's like I've been swimming in muddy waters.
LINDA: Like muddy waters?
BABE BROTHER: It was like all those things old country people try to tell you what hell is like.
LINDA: You were in hell?
BABE BROTHER: I couldn't believe the things I was doing. It was like an internal struggle going on inside my body.
LINDA: Do you think you won?
BABE BROTHER: It was nip and tuck.
LINDA: And what lesson have we learned from all of this, Babe Br... Sam... I mean Samuel?
BABE BROTHER: I guess it proves you really care about me. You hung in there.
GIDEON: When are you boys going to fix that roof?
BABE BROTHER: Soon as I rest a bit. I meant as soon as we are back to normal again, anytime.
GIDEON: Here I am thinking about myself when poor Harry is resting on the floor of the kitchen.
