BIANCA: But she doesn't want to date.
WALTER: Exactly my point
WALTER: Jesus! Can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating?
SHARON: Tumescent!
WALTER: You're not helping.
BIANCA: Can we make this quick? Roxanne Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break- up on the quad. Again.
CAMERON: Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you.
BIANCA: Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part. Please.
CAMERON: Okay... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine. Saturday? Night?
BIANCA: You're asking me out. That's so cute. What's your name again?
CAMERON: Forget it.
BIANCA: No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have a proper introduction ---
CAMERON: Cameron.
BIANCA: The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser. My sister. I can't date until she does.
CAMERON: Seems like she could get a date easy enough...
CAMERON: Why?
BIANCA: Unsolved mystery. She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something.
CAMERON: That's a shame.
BIANCA: Gosh, if only we could find Kat a boyfriend...
CAMERON: Let me see what I can do.
