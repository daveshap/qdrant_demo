JOHN: It's just so blatantly stupid, I have a hard time believing you did it.
CYNTHIA: What's so stupid about it?
JOHN: That you... you don't even know the guy.
CYNTHIA: Well, you know him, he's a friend of yours, do you think he can be trusted?
JOHN: Shit, after what you've told me, I don't know. I should've known, when he showed up dressed like some arty brat.
CYNTHIA: I like the way he dresses.
JOHN: What if this tape gets into the wrong hands?
CYNTHIA: The wrong hands"? We're not talking about military secrets
JOHN: Jesus Christ. And he doesn't have sex with any of them? They just talk?
CYNTHIA: Right.
JOHN: Jesus. I could almost understand it if he was screwing these people, almost. Why doesn't he just buy some magazines or porno movies or something?
CYNTHIA: Doesn't work. He has to know the people, he has to be able to interact with them.
JOHN: Interact, fine, but did you have to masturbate in front of him, for God's sake? I mean...
CYNTHIA: I felt like it, so what? Goddam, you and Ann make such a big deal out of it.
JOHN: You told Ann about this?
CYNTHIA: Of course. She is my sister. I tell her almost everything.
JOHN: I wish you hadn't done that.
CYNTHIA: Why not?
JOHN: It's just something I'd prefer she didn't know about.
CYNTHIA: She's a grown-up, she can handle it.
JOHN: I just... Ann is very...
CYNTHIA: Hung up.
JOHN: It just wasn't a smart thing to do. Did you sign any sort of paper, or did he have any contract with you saying he wouldn't broadcast these tapes?
CYNTHIA: No.
JOHN: You realize you have no recourse legally? This stuff could show up anywhere.
CYNTHIA: It won't. I trust him.
JOHN: You trust him.
CYNTHIA: Yeah, I do. A helluva lot more than I trust you.
JOHN: What do you mean?
CYNTHIA: Exactly what I said. I'd trust him before I'd trust you. How much clearer can I be?
JOHN: It hurts that you would say that to me.
CYNTHIA: Oh, please. Come on, John. You're fucking your wife's sister and you hardly been married a year. You're a liar. But at least I know you're a liar. It's the people that don't know, like Ann, that have to watch out.
JOHN: By definition you're lying to Ann, too.
CYNTHIA: That's right. But I never took a vow in front of God and everybody to be faithful" to my sister."
JOHN: Look, are we going to do it or not?
CYNTHIA: Actually, no, I've changed my mind. I shouldn't have called.
JOHN: Well, I'm here now. I'd like to do something...
CYNTHIA: How about straightening up the living room?
CYNTHIA: Come on, John. You should be happy, we've gone this far without Ann finding out, I'm making it real easy on you. Just walk out of here and I'll see you at your house for a family dinner sometime.
JOHN: Did he put you up to this?
CYNTHIA: Who?
JOHN: Graham.
CYNTHIA: No, he didn't put me up to this. Jesus, I don't need people to tell me what I should do. I've just been thinking about things, that's all.
JOHN: I can't believe I let him stay in my house. Right under my nose. That deviant fucker was right under my nose and I didn't see him.
CYNTHIA: If he had been under your prick you'd have spotted him for sure.
JOHN: God, you... you're mean.
CYNTHIA: I know. Will you please leave now?
JOHN: Maybe I don't want to leave. Maybe I want to talk.
CYNTHIA: John, we have nothing to talk about.
JOHN: I knew it, I knew it. Things are getting complicated.
CYNTHIA: No, John, things are getting real simple.
