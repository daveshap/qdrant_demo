CHARLIE: If we went out that window right now we'd have a chance...
BETTY: I better go check on them.
CHARLIE: Wait, Betty... you still haven't answered me.
BETTY: This is really awkward...
CHARLIE: Ahh, it's too late, anyway. It's too late. Listen, I could shoot my way out, maybe take one of them with me... If you'd gimme my gun back.
BETTY: I'd rather not...
CHARLIE: Betty, I don't wanna shrivel up alone in some stinking prison. No way. I've got some professional pride. And I don't want anybody else to get the credit for taking me out.
BETTY: ...what're you saying?
CHARLIE: When a Roman general knew a battle was lost, he'd throw himself on his sword.
CHARLIE: Did... did you really come here because you love this guy?
BETTY: Yes... Not the actor, though, the doctor. I think.
CHARLIE: So all this... really was because of that soap opera? My son is dead because you came out here to be with that doctor? A fake doctor?
BETTY: I wouldn't have put it quite that way, but...
CHARLIE: Wesley didn't even want to come up here. He warned me, but I insisted... I have to ask you, Betty...are you crazy?
BETTY: I don't think I am.
