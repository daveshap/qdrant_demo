sibling stress
I have a younger brother who has trouble controlling his emotions, he has recently been diagnosed with dyspraxia and fine motor skills. Being extremely sensitive this effects me. Whenever I do the smallest thing that doesn’t involve him he starts crying, blames it on me or has a tantrum. He’s only 10. My mum tells me to go away and leave him alone, but when he calls me names and attacks me it’s real difficult to just walk away and let him win. I don’t want him when he’s older to think if he does something he’ll win and get away from it. But him doing all of this makes me stressed and anxious. From this I usually break down and start crying. The other day my mum called me a disappointment which really hit hard. I don’t know what to do and how to deal with when I get stressed, or how to cope with walking away. Any advice or anything please.
