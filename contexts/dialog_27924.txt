JERRY: Doc -- something you said the other day --
GALBRAITH: Yes?
JERRY: It doesn't jibe with this —— you told me the leopard would go out into the country —- it wouldn't stay in the city ——
GALBRAITH: Sure -- certainly —- but what's that got to do with this?
JERRY: That's what I don't understand -- why should it come here -- and why didn't it stay here? It's got trees and bushes here -- outside nothing but cement and asphalt.
GALBRAITH: Jerry, I talked to you about the habits of an ordinary wild leopard. This leopard is another matter entirely - - a caged animal travelling around with Charlie How Come for years and years.. That's why it kills human beings.
JERRY: Why?
GALBRAITH: It doesn't know how to hunt its natural prey.
JERRY: But it doesn't eat what it kills.
GALBRAITH: Caged animals are unpredictable. They're like frustrated human beings. I can't answer your question.
ROBLES: That's why it just mauls and tears at them.
JERRY: Something's wrong with this whole setup --
ROBLES: Yes, there is something wrong. People who want publicity and don't mind how they get it --what risks they make other people run - - what agony and sorrow they bring to other people --
JERRY: I know all that, chief, and I don't like it any better than you do, but there's something else --
GALBRAITH: Just a minute, Robles. Let him go on.
JERRY: I can understand about the cat killing the first girl. Charlie How Come told me. All that noise and those lights -- scared crazy it would do anything. Last night there was nothing to disturb it. Just a little girl alone in a cemetery.
ROBLES: What are you getting at?
JERRY: Nothing much -- just that it might not be a cat this time.
