Emergency question!
Hey there. Throw off for obvious reasons. I have a quick question. My gf has herpes on her lips, it’s second day since it came up. We had sex and we gently kissed on the lips. After couple minutes I forgot about the kiss and swiftly licked her “women parts”. Should we be concerned? We cleaned it with the wet hygiene tissues and wiped dry with regular tissues

Edit: She’s taking antiviral meds as so as she noticed herpes on her lips.
