CROW HORSE: Red Deer Table, Ray.
RAY: Don't tell me: heavy duty.
CROW HORSE: Heavy, heavy duty. Taku Wakan. Wanagi Spirits. It's one of those few places we'd never go to as kids. Still don't. Some of the old people say Crazy Horse is buried back there. We have to go Ray. Together. Like his vision.
RAY: Walter. When I fill out my 302, do I say that evil spirits are killing everybody on the reservation?
CROW HORSE: Ray --
RAY: -- no. No offense to the old man. I appreciate you trying to help. But I put my ass on the line coming out here, man.
CROW HORSE: What'd you expect to hear?
RAY: Not Native American myths and legends. I'm with the FBI, Walter, remember? Not National Geographic.
CROW HORSE: What you call myths, we call our history.
RAY: It's not real.
CROW HORSE: What's real to you? Wall Street? Capital Hill? Now they are myths.
RAY: I can't be dicking around here. That's all I'm saying. I don't carry crystals, I don't wanna come back in another life. I just wanna do my job, and do it right, and get the fuck outta here.
CROW HORSE: You ain't no Indian. You're a Sal Mineo Indian.
