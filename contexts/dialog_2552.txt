GEORGE: What do I say?
MARTY: Say what you were supposed to say in the cafeteria.
GEORGE: Oh, no! That was for the cafeteria! This is different!
MARTY: Christ, it's a miracle I was even born!
GEORGE: Huh?
MARTY: Nothing. Look, I'll write it down for you, okay?
GEORGE: What is that? A pencil that writes in ink?
MARTY: It was Marty's turn to be confused. Huh?
GEORGE: Lemme see that.
GEORGE: 'Bike fine point?'
MARTY: Bic... It's a Bic pen.
