How do I reduce the frequency of electric current for part of a circuit that has variable frequencies? I want to reduce the frequency of electrical current that is operating in the 220 to 240 khz range, to being a maximum of 20khz.  I want it to still be variable though, and the magnitude of variation to be the same (so 240 kHz for the part of circuit operating at high frequency becomes 20 kHz on the low frequency part,  and 220 kHz becomes either 0 kHz (subtracting the frequency to get it below the maximum), or about 18 kHz if we scale it down by 12 (240/12=20, 220/12= appr. 18.33).  Really I just want to know how to isolate a part of a circuit and have it shift the frequency of the electrical current down to a frequency that is compatible with being heard when sent through a speaker.  The magnitude of the reduction for each side doesn't matter, it doesn't even need to be equal, as long as it remains variable but is reduced to a hearable frequency.Extra Details:  The circuit I have already converts DC current into pulsed current using Schmitt triggers.  This pulse is sent into an induction coil to create a pulsed em field at the same frequency.  If a conductive material or ferrous metal goes within the effective range of the pulsed em field, it induces current in the material and generates its own em field, which affects the pulse going through the induction coil, changing the frequency that the current is at.  I want to be able to detect that change in frequency.  Most methods involve converting it into sound through various means, one being to wrap some wire from the circuit around an AM radio, another being directly connecting it to a speaker of some sort along with an amplifier, but only after converting it to frequency that the speaker will output within the human hearing range.
