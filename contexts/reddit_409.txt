How can I be happy for other people? :(
So I wasn’t exposed to a lot as a child as far as support from my parents and encouragement goes. They say they were there for me when it came to my passions and interests but they never actually were. I’ve missed out on a lot of my life because of myself and also because of their discouragement. Until recently I never thought I was capable of learning the things I wanted to learn or doing the things I wanted to do; I was isolated and in online school with no friends or socialization. I’m in public school now and I’m finding it difficult being happy for other people especially my friends. I’m accidentally envious towards them and I don’t mean to be, how can I change this behavior tho? For example, a lot of them are really into music. I am too, I’m a sound engineer but I don’t know how to play any instruments and when they talk about playing and performing I get really upset even if I try to stop myself from getting upset. It still upsets me, I think it’s because I wish I had that skill and I’m working on it, but it’s not something I’m capable of doing in the same way right now. Any advice? It’s just jealousy in general, like they’ve all known each other since they were little and I’m just kind of here. It’s getting better but it’s also getting worse.
