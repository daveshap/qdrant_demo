I didn’t plan on bringing in my 30th birthday alone. But here I am. And that’s ok!
I was flaked on not once but twice yesterday by two different guys lol. Guy #1 “loosely” invited me to dinner then stopped responding. Guy #2 was supposed to meet up with me for drinks then 20 mins before proclaimed that he “lost his wallet” so couldn’t make it anymore. 

So, you know what I did? I went out absolutely solo and that’s ok! One thing I have learned while dating is not to put your happiness in the hands of others. People will flake. You’ll get mixed signals. You’ll think everything is going great and then it dissipates. It’s all a part of the race I suppose. 

I’m at a turning point in my life where I’m becoming ok with being alone. I’m learning to celebrate and enjoy my own company. I know my worth. I’m intelligent, beautiful, smart and pretty funny if I must say so myself. 

One day, I’ll find someone who is interested in being an extension of me. I do want a relationship but I won’t force one just to have someone. So as I woke up on this “monumental day”, I laughed, I smiled, even cried a little bit. But I’m here and I’m present. Happy Birthday to me.
