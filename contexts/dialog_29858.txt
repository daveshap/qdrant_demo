STANLEY: Oh, the uncle is missing.
DESMOND: Not Cole's Uncle but probably the sheriff's uncle in federal prison.
STANLEY: So the sheriff had got an Uncle who's committed a serious crime.
DESMOND: Right, which is probably why Lil was wearing a red wig meaning we are headed into a dangerous situation. Let me ask you something, Stanley, did you notice anything about the dress?
STANLEY: The dress she was wearing had been altered to fit her. I noticed a different colored thread where the dress had been taken in. It wasn't her dress or she must have lost some weight.
DESMOND: Gordon said you were good. The tailored dress is our code for drugs. Did you notice what was pinned to it?
STANLEY: A blue rose.
DESMOND: Very good, but I can't tell you about that.
STANLEY: What did Gordon's tie mean?
DESMOND: What? That's just Gordon's bad taste.
STANLEY: Why couldn't he have just told you all these things?
DESMOND: He talks loud. And he loves his code.
STANLEY: I see. He does talk loud.
DESMOND: Gordon would not have sent us to Deer Meadow without thinking it was a high priority situation.
STANLEY: It must be a high priority situation.
