My little brother has unlocked comebacks
I asked him “why did the chicken cross the road?” He said “to get to the other side?” I said no, that it crossed it to get to the idiot’s house. Then I said “knock knock” he asked who’s there and I said “the chicken”.

After a couple of seconds of indignation his face changed into a grin and said “oh, you must be looking for my brother, let me get him for you”.

Not bad kid...
