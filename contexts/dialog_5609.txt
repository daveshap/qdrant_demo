REGGIE: Him: 'Do you mind if I come in for a nightcap, Reggie?' Her: 'Well -- it is awfully late.' Him: 'Just one, all right?' Her: 'Promise you'll behave yourself.' Him: 'Sorry, baby, I never make promises I can't keep.'
PETER: How would you like a spanking?
REGGIE: How would you like a punch in the nose? Stop treating me like a child.
PETER: Then stop acting like one. If you're really in some kind of trouble, I'd like to hear about it. Otherwise, it's late, I'm tired and I'm going home to bed.
REGGIE: Do you know what's wrong with you?
PETER: What?
REGGIE: Nothing. Good night.
PETER: Good night.
