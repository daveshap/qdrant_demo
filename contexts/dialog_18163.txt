LUCIANO: At least Masseria plays by the rules. Maranzano thinks he's God, and the rules don't apply.
LANSKY: Without us, Masseria don't stand a chance, and he knows it.
FRANK: I'm sorry, but I sleep better when I know I'm with the winning side.
LANSKY: We're gonna be the winning side. It's like Rothstein said about that guy in Austria. We're gonna use Maranzano and Masseria. Let 'em knock each other bloody. And then, when everybody's screamin' for peace, we step in to make it. What they're fight in' over, everybody will beg us to take.
FRANK: I thought we just wanted to be left alone to run our business.
