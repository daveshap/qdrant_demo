Looking for a short story in which an alien visits earth using ftl after a sub-light interstellar probe visits their star I'm almost certain this is a Larry Niven short-story but I don't know how to identify it.It's set in the equivalent of a NASA project station and they are receiving the telemetry from an interstellar probe as it encounters a star and contact is about to fade as the probe goes around the far side of the star. The alien in the audience apologetically explains that telemetry won't resume because they shot and destroyed the probe.The alien explains that his race is deeply impressed by the humans' ability to create technology that can still work after the journey but the humans are depressed because the alien used ftl technology to easily achieve what was a monumental project for humans.
