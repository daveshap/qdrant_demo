I'm tired of being a nice, responsible, honest, overall "good" person.
I feel like these traits make people take advantage of me. Everyday I see people who lean more on being bad (cheaters, liars, dicks, irresponsible people, etc) get away with it. Sometimes they even get more than what they deserve.

I'm tired of being "nice" but I can't help it. I feel guilty when I hurt other people, when I don't take care of my responsibilities. But it seems like I don't even get anything for it. Do you see what I mean? These dishonest pricks get away with being dishonest pricks, and I on the other hand, gain nothing. So what's the point of being good anymore? I should grow a mean spine.

Being nice/good makes me feel weak.  I hate it. I'm tired of it. But it's who I am. I don't like hurting people and I don't like being irresponsible.  

I don't like being taken advantage of, so maybe I should just be mean.
