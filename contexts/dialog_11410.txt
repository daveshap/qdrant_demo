MRS. BRADDOCK: It's pretty embarrassing. I really don't know what to tell Mr. Robinson. It's awkward and strained for me every time he suggests that you call up Elaine.
BEN: Next time he suggests it, I'll tell him I have no intention of ever calling her up in my life.
MR. BRADDOCK: I guess she's not good enough for you, is that it?
BEN: Look -- Elaine Robinson and I do not get along.
MR. BRADDOCK: How do you know? You haven't seen her since high school. I guess your evenings, whatever you do with them, are just too valuable.
BEN: That has nothing to do with it --
MR. BRADDOCK: I guess I'll just tell Mr. Robinson that you're just too busy every evening -- doing God knows what --
MRS. BRADDOCK: Don't go on like this. Now if Benjamin absolutely refuses to take her out --
BEN: I do.
MRS. BRADDOCK: -- then I'll simply invite all the Robinsons' over for dinner on Thursday.
