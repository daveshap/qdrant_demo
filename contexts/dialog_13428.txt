ALMA: Things so bad, nobody can help -- not even Doctor Maxwell.
BETSY: Doctors and nurses can only do so much, Alma. They can't cure everything.
ALMA: Doctors that are people can't cure everything.
BETSY: What do you mean -- doctors that are people"?"
ALMA: There are other doctors...Yes, other doctors...Better doctors...
BETSY: Where?
ALMA: At the Houmfort.
BETSY: That's nonsense, Alma.
ALMA: They even cure nonsense, Miss Betsy. Mama Rose was mindless. I was at the Houmfort when the Houngan brought her mind back.
BETSY: You mean Mama Rose was like Mrs. Holland?
ALMA: No. She was mindless but not like Miss Jessica. But the Houngan cured her.
BETSY: Are you trying to tell me that the Houngan -- the voodoo priest -- could cure Mrs. Holland?
ALMA: Yes, Miss Betsy. I mean that. The Houngan will speak to the rada drums and the drums will speak to Shango and Damballa.
