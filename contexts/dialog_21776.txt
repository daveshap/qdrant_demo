JAKE: What who's been sayin'?
EAGAN: You were a big favorite in this fight. Then two days ago the odds start jumping all over the place until you're a 12-5 underdog.
JAKE: I don't follow no gamblin' Commissioner. I'm just a fighter.
EAGAN: Now the fight's off the books altogether. Meyer Lansky couldn't get a bet down on this fight. Some people are saying you're going into the tank.
JAKE: Believe what you want.
EAGAN: I want to believe you, LaMotta.
JAKE: I'm gonna kill him. That fuckin' jig's gonna wish he never came outa the jungle. You got any money?
EAGAN: What?
JAKE: You got any money you want to bet on Billy Fox, you can put it right here... 'cause Jake LaMotta don't go down for nobody.
