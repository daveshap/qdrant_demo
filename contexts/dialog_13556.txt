MARGARET: Your son.
JASMINE: He's my angel.
MARGARET: Was his father stationed here?
JASMINE: He wasn't his father. I was kinda hoping he'd want the job, though.
MARGARET: So, what do you do for a living?
JASMINE: I'm a dancer.
MARGARET: Really? Ballet?
JASMINE: No. Exotic.
MARGARET: Oh. Sorry.
JASMINE: Don't be. I'm not. It's good money. 'Side, he's worth it.
MARGARET: And when the dancing's over? What about your future?
JASMINE: Funny, it used to scare me when I thought about the future. Guess it doesn't really matter anymore.
JASMINE: Dylan, come here. I want you to meet the First Lady.
MARGARET: I thought you didn't recognize me.
JASMINE: Didn't want to say anything. I voted for the other guy.
