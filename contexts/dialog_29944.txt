JOHN: Doesn't the heat bother you?
GRACE: Yeah, but I like the sun. I grew up on a reservation. The sun, the desert; they were like a religion to us. Jake's the same way. He loves the desert. I guess we're alike that way. That's about the only way.
JOHN: You love him?
GRACE: No.
JOHN: Did you ever?
GRACE: Depends on what you call love. When I was growing up I had nothing. I learned to want everything. I wanted more than Sierra anyway. Jake was my ticket. He's not much; he's older than me, different than me, but he's got more money than half this town put together. I courted him. I let him think he was courtin' me, but I reeled him in like a fish on a line. I wanted him. I wanted what he could give me, and I would've done anything to get him. Is that love?
JOHN: I'm guessing no.
GRACE: Yeah, I guess you're right.
JOHN: And I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.
GRACE: I'm still here, aren't I? See this?
GRACE: All this nothing? I've spent my life in this stinking desert. It doesn't get to Jake like it got to me. He doesn't mind being out here. He doesn't mind being nothing but a land broker. Big fish in a small pond, he says. More like a little fish in a dried up watering hole.
JOHN: You could just leave him.
GRACE: I don't know how.
JOHN: You just walk away.
GRACE: It's not that easy. Maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please. I can't. I don't want to be alone. I need to know I'm going to be taken care of.
JOHN: You need a meal ticket is what you mean. Some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here.
GRACE: Is that so bad? It's not like I wouldn't try to make him happy. For awhile, anyway. I mean, I would . . . do things for him. I guess I'm no good that way. I guess I tried to sucker you along like that. Do you hate me for it? I wouldn't blame you if you did. But maybe it's like you said: You just got to do whatever it takes to get out.
JOHN: Whatever it takes.
