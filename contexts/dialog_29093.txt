DOC: Well hell, Wyatt. Wyatt, I want You to meet Father Feeney. Father Feeney's just been initiating me Into the mysteries of the great And ancient Church of Rome. You See, it appears my hypocrisy Knows no bounds.
WYATT: How you feelin', Doc?
DOC: Rather an obvious question under The circumstances, don't you Agree? A better one might be how Do you feel?
WYATT: Hurts. Hurts pretty bad.
DOC: I imagine it would, yes. So now We can add self-pity to your list Of frailties.
WYATT: All right, Doc...
DOC: You think I'm kidding. You're the Most fallible, wrong-headed, self- Deluding, just generally Benighted jackass I've ever Known. Yet, withal, even at your Worst, you're the only human Being in my entire life who ever Gave me hope.
WYATT: All I ever wanted was to live a Normal life.
DOC: When will you wake up? You Wouldn't know a normal life if it Bit you in the ass.
WYATT: That's great coming from you.
DOC: I played the cards I was dealt, Wyatt. Your problem is you're Always trying to play someone Else's. Allow me to tell you the Truth and thus set you free: There is no happiness, Wyatt There is no normal life. There's Only life, that's all. Just life. The rest is relative.
WYATT: Then what do I do?
DOC: First you can grab that black- Haired woman and make her your own.
WYATT: All right. Then what?
DOC: Run. Take that girl and start Running. Run and don't look back. All your life you been running And looking back and just barely Existing and calling it getting By. This time run and don't look Back and call it living. Live Every second, live it right up to The hilt. Live, Wyatt... Live for me.
