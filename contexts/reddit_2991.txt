Recent college graduate with degree in biology. Discovered I hate academia and grad school isn’t for me. Go back to school for a trade? Push through with career using B.S. degree? Just look for advice please!!
Recent college graduate with biology degree. Not sure where to go, especially in these weird times.

So I have a biology degree with a focus in ecology and conservation. I’ve had numerous internships and some research experience. I found in the past four years of university that I despise academia, so going back for grad school won’t be happening any time soon if I want to keep my head on straight. 

Personally, I feel the urge to go to community college and get a trade certificate...maybe I’m ungrateful for my degree, but I simply can’t see how I am marketable in the work force with the degree I have. I have learned that I’m a very hands on person, which is why I’m leaning towards learning a skilled trade.

On the other hand, I’ve also had an interest in GIS, so I could easily get a certificate in GIS which would pair nicely with my current degree. However, I have become quite opposed to desk work in the past year. 

All in all, I feel quite silly for the degree I got and further confused because I’m a much different person than I was when I started school in terms of work ethic...maybe I’m not different, but I certainly have learned more about who I am and what I think I desire out of life.

Thanks for simply reading through this little rant. Feel free to ask questions if you’d like to hear more about my situation/if you feel I’ve left anything out. 

TLDR: Want a hands on career. Not a desk job. Am I acting childish, or should I go back and get schooled in a trade?
