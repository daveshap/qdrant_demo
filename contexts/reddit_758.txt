Ex friend
There was a girl that I was super close with at the beginning of last year, we had sleepovers at both of our houses multiple times. (we had also been friends in 7th grade but lost touch) I decided to tell her that I was bi, and she completely cut me off and stopped talking our entire lunch table. I hated her for so long. We have floral design together and the teacher assigned us seats next to each other. At first I just stayed silent, but she's been making an effort and I think she wants to be friends again. She's been seeing me do art on my iPad for years so the other day she logged into her account to download procreate for me so I didn't have to pay for it. I do usually give people second chances but never this quick, I don't know how to feel yet, if she's actually been able to change enough for me to let her in again.
