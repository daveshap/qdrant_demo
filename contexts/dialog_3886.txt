HEATHER: Dad...?
DOMINI: What'd you say?
DOMINI: Are you alright?
HEATHER: ....I don't know.
DOMINI: So lemme see it.
COTTER: Just let me get my coat off--I had eight cups of coffee, I'm wired for sound here.
HEATHER: Where <u>is</u> it?
COTTER: I got the tape enhanced--and I managed to sleaze a photo blow-up. Jesus, he's gonna kill me when he finds out about the camera.
HEATHER: Gimme it!
