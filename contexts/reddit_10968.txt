anyone else feel like the concept of life is such a cruel thing
we are literally born for no reason, no one asked to be here and weâ€™re all going to eventually die anyways. yet we have to study, work and make a living for the bare minimum. literally everything is meaningless. how the fuck did everything even start? why is life so unusual and complex. i feel like an alien.
