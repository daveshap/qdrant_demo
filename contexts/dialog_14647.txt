MIKE: After all, that's how you catch fish, isn't it?
PHILIP: You could also try a bamboo pole and a worm.
CALVIN: What's your plan, Brody?
MIKE: It's easy. Put a net on the derrick. Put the net in the water by the intake passage. Turn off the intake passage. Shark comes out into the net and is hauled up.
PHILIP: A piece of pie on Sunday.
KATHRYN: The net would have to be secured by the intake passage.
MIKE: That's right.
KATHRYN: Who's going to do it?
MIKE: Me.
KATHRYN: Michael, you're not going down there.
MIKE: I am. You're not.
KATHRYN: But you --
MIKE: It's a construction job. I'm the only one that can do it.
PHILIP: I'll go with you.
MIKE: No way.
PHILIP: I'll stay out of your way. I won't interfere.
MIKE: I'm sure you won't. But you're going to have to wait till we come up. Then you can film all you want.
KATHRYN: Michael, you don't have to go down there.
MIKE: I want that shark, Kathryn.
KATHRYN: You don't have to prove anything.
MIKE: Only to myself.
