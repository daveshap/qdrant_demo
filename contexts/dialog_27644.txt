PETE: Sir, that is true.
CLYDE: Mr. Appleton, do you know an Albert Lucas Trumbo?""
PETE: Luke Trumbo? We never met. But I'd like to think I know him.
CLYDE: Is that because you were masquerading as Luke Trumbo while you were in Lawson?
PETE: Mr. Clyde you're twisting things around. I wasn't masquerading. Luke Trumbo... Luke was a good man who gave his life for his country. I just... happen to look a little bit like him. That's all.
CLYDE: Yes, I see that Private Trumbo was reported missing in action and is presumed dead. I also see that you were posted stateside during the war. Fort Dix?
PETE: Yes, sir.
CLYDE: Well, I'm sure we're all glad to see you came through it all right.
CLYDE: Now, I see that you've been running a movie theater in Lawson called The Bijou
PETE: Yes sir. But I didn't go to Lawson to run The Bijou, that was... that was something that just happened. You see, I was involved in an accident in Lawson, and I spent some time recovering there.
CLYDE: Anyone who reads the newspaper is quite familiar with your... accident
PETE: Yes.
CLYDE: And what is the state of your memory now?
