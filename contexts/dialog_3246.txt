ADAM: Handbook for the recently diseased.
BARBARA: De<u>ceased</u>. I don't know where it came from.
ADAM: Look at the publisher. Handbook for the Recently Deceased Press.
BARBARA: I don't think we survived the crash.
ADAM: This is going to take some time.
BARBARA: I don't like situations like this. I hate it when I'm not in control. So just tell me the basics.
ADAM: This book isn't arranged that way. What do you want to know?
BARBARA: There are a thousand things... Why did you disappear when you walked off the front porch? Is this a punishment? Are we halfway to heaven or are we halfway to hell? And how long is this going to <u>last</u>?
ADAM: I don't see anything about 'Rewards and Punishments' or 'Heaven and Hell.' This book reads like stereo instructions! Listen to this... 'Geographical and Temporal Perimeters... Functional perimeters vary from manifestation to manifestation.' This is going to take some time.
