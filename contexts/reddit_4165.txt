I know this is crazy, but I think she's my soulmate. How do I approach her without coming off as a creep?
Okay, so here is some background. When I was 12 years old, my mom sent me to a summer camp where we spent 11 nights in the woods. I didn't know anyone and other campers were mean to me. Except this one girl. She spotted me sitting alone and came over to talk to me. I thought she was the most beautiful person I'd ever seen at that point. She told me her name and we spoke for all of 5 minutes. Over the years, I've thought of her here and there and have even dreamt of our encounter on occasion. I've tried Facebook searches to find her but without her last name it's impossible. But last night I dreamt of her again. This time, it was different. It felt so real. We were both adults and getting married. Anyway, when I woke up I hop on Tinder and there she is. I swipe right and it's a match. 12 years later and I've finally found her. This is crazy. What do I say? Should I see if she remembers me? I don't want to come off as creepy.

UPDATE: 

We're finally gonna meet up. I asked her to go to Summerfest with me next week and she said yes.
