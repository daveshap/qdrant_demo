Is it possible to be over qualified for a internship
So I’m a university student entering my last year. I need to hunt down an internship. 

I have devoted the last 3 years to building my resumes. Over the last 3 years I have acquired work experience through a medical school, oil companies, political parties and lobby groups. 

After my experience I have had all top ranking people from these organizations advocate for me and say that I am a darn good employee. 

I also have my name published in a university journal for research. Three times actually. 

That information is on my resume. 

This sounds great and all but it most certainly is not. Someone entering their second year of my program is also hunting for a job. She told everyone she applied for it and I happened to apply for it as well. She has 0 prior work or volunteer experience. Well I guess she worked at foot locker for 3 months. Well long story short I didn’t even hear an email back and she was hired without an interview. 

What???? Is it possible to be over qualified

Like I have worked my butt off for the last 3 years. I have skipped personal events, stopped playing sports, and have cut off relationships. All of this just to build my resume into the beast it is today. Now I can’t even hear back from a entry level internship position
