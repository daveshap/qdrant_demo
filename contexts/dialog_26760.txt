JOHN: Now don't take this the wrong way, but you are a terminator, right?
TERMINATOR: Yes. Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.
JOHN: No way!
JOHN: Holy shit... you're really real! I mean... whoah! You're, uh... like a machine underneath, right... but sort of alive outside?
TERMINATOR: I'm a cybernetic organism. Living tissue over a metal endoskeleton.
JOHN: This in intense. Get a grip, John. Okay, uh... you're not here to kill me... I figured that part out for myself. So what's the deal?
TERMINATOR: My mission is to protect you.
JOHN: Yeah? Who sent you?
TERMINATOR: You did. Thirty years from now you reprogrammed me to be your protector here, in this time.
