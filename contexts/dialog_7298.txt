MERLE: You can do it, Sal.
SAL: No. No, no.
MERLE: Sal... listen to me, Sal! You have to do it.
SAL: I want to go home, Merle.
MERLE: You have to think about this, Sal. Listen to me, Sal! You have to think about this.
SAL: This is horrible!
MERLE: Listen to me, Sal. If you don't do it they'll put you in the pit. If they put you in the pit, Sal, you're gonna die... Sal, do you understand?
SAL: Merle, I wanna go home!
