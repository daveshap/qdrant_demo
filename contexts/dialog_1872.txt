MATUSCHKA: Baxter?
BUD: Yes?
MATUSCHKA: What's with you, Fran -- did you forget where you live?
FRAN: This is my brother-in-law, Karl Matuschka.
BUD: How do you do, Mr. Matuschka?
MATUSCHKA: Okay, get your clothes on. I got the cab downstairs.
BUD: Now, wait a minute. I know what you're thinking -- but it's not as bad as it looks -- MATUSCHKA It's none of my business what you do, Fran -- you're over twenty- one -- but your sister happens to think you're a lady.
BUD: All we were going to do is eat and wash the dishes --
MATUSCHKA: Look, Buddy-boy -- if there wasn't a lady present, I'd clobber you.
