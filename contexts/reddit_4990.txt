"How to Save a Life"-- my nightmare
i was listening to "How to Save a Life" by the Fray and it just hit me how many people who are listening have probably lost their loved ones and felt helpless at some point because they "failed" to save them. idk why but the idea was so potent and charged with such strong sentiments that for a second i urged myself to trade shoes with one of these people and the feeling had me crying so hard. i felt idle, like a disappointment, like i failed someone i didn't even know who in a way relied on me to end their misery but instead i just watched them slip away into thin air while my hands were cuffed. the desire to reach out and grab their hand with every muscle in my feeble body was there but not strong enough to cast off the shackles of oblivion, ignorance and apathy. as the song went on , i was still trapped in this body of a someone who didn't know how to save a life. a life that felt incredibly real and close to me even though it was a mere figment of my broken imagination. the idea of this person drowning in a sea of dark wishes, hopeless thoughts and broken hearts had me gasping for a nonexistent power to just invade my own imagination and toy with the plot, hoping for a happy ending one that unfortunately wasn't meant to be. as the video neared its ending i began to imagine the countless lives ending as i stood inert,helpless and hopeless. i wished i could save all of them but i soon realized that i don't know "how to save a life" and neither did those people.
