MARSHALL: Did they say anything about my family?
V.P. CHANDLER: They're still alive, but the loyalists plan to start killing hostages in forty minutes.
MARSHALL: Then tell me there's a rescue operation underway.
V.P. CHANDLER: and if that means negotiating...
MARSHALL: You know my policy. We don't negotiate with terrorists. If we start now, all of America becomes a target.
V.P. CHANDLER: But this is different, sir. You're the President.
V.P. CHANDLER: Please, Mr. President. You're going to get yourself killed. Is that your solution?
MARSHALL: Freeing Stravanavitch is gonna get tens of thousands killed. I can't live with that. I'm not royalty. I'm an elected official and the integrity of the office of the President is infinitely more important than the man who holds that office. We don't negotitate. Not as long as I'm President. Is that understood?
