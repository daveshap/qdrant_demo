Get linux 'screen' to recognize xterm mouse-click cols > 95 I have a Web-based terminal using xterm.js and ssh2 from node.js.  When I click, xterm.js sends mouse-click coords via xterm escape sequences.  This works fine.  When using the 'screen' cli utility, anything greater than 95 columns is registered as 95 columns.  An example is, when using Midnight Commander over 'screen',  it only registers clicks past 95 cols at the 95th column.  Without 'screen', it works normally.  Is there an easy fix?I'm using Ubuntu LTS.
