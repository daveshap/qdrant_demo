Moved files to trash when booted with Linux CD, can I recover them? This sounds really silly... I burnt an ISO of Ubuntu 16.04.4 LTS to a disk and booted up the Live CD with the first option (try Ubuntu without installing). I mounted an external hard drive and moved a folder to trash. I then emptied the trash.Can this folder be recovered? Does the Ubuntu disk use the hard drive of the the machine it booted on to hold temporary files so it may be there? Or will I have to run a recovery tool on the external hard drive?
