SIDNEY: Awright, that brings us up to five weeks ago. Sidney
HUNSECKER: Are you finished?
SIDNEY: No, lemme finish. I DON'T LIKE THIS JOB! That boy is dumb only on matinee days - otherwise he's got a head. And Susan, like you said, she's growing up. Two heads. What I mean, we got a slippery, dangerous problem here!
HUNSECKER: Not we"
SIDNEY: Correct me if I'm wrong - WE! Because when I'm out on this very slippery limb for you, you have to know what's involved.
HUNSECKER: Ha! My right hand hasn't seen my left hand for thirty years!
SIDNEY: I'll do it, J.J. - don't get me wrong - in for a penny, in for a pound. I'll see it through, but stop beating me around the head. Let me make a living!
HUNSECKER: What you promised - do it! Don't finagle around. It's later than you think.
