HAL: Could you identify 'em, if ya saw 'em again?
LENA: Hal, I've told you about twenty times, yes, I could identify 'em, but neither one of them was the type to pull something like this.
HAL: Well, you're not exactly an expert witness, but what makes you so sure?
LENA: If waitin' tables in a bar don't make you an expert on human nature, then nothin' will, and I could've told you that Harlan Puckett would end up buyin' it in a parkin' lot. I'm just surprised it didn't happen before now.
HAL: Who do you think did it?
LENA: Has anybody asked his wife? She's the one I hope did it.
HAL: Lena, just cut the bullshit, will ya? Do have any ideas or don't ya? I been standin' in this stupid parkin' lot all goddamn night, and I still got to go file a report before I can go home in time to get back up again!
LENA: Well, if I had to guess, I'd say it was some ol' gal, some ol' gal's husband. But it wasn't either one of those two. The tall one, the redhead, she left me a huge tip.
HAL: You didn't happen to notice what kind of car they were driving?
LENA: It's a nightclub, not a drive-in, Hal. I don't follow the customers to the parking lot.
HAL: Alright, Lena. Go on home. We might have to call you in for some more questioning.
