Ubuntu 16.04 running on Acer Aspire ES1 571 I am trying to purchase a mid-range laptop which will be used with Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. Not an easy task in my country (Hungary) since it is practically impossible to get Ubuntu-preinstalled laptops here.Does anybody have experience with the Acer Aspire ES1 571 series on Ubuntu 16.04?installation tricks necessary (if the Ubuntu installer fails on it by default)which hw components don't work at all after a default installwhich hw components work after a default install but only badly (e.g. low wifi performance because there are no proper drivers for Ubuntu but works normally under Windows)Many thanksEspecially see comments in Answer 1.
