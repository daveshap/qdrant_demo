Higher Ed College Planning Consulting- Post Masters Credentials
So, I have been doing some research on what is needed to become an College Transition Counselor/College Planning Consulting. I have been researching credentials that I would need beyond the master's degree. I am planning on getting my masters in College Student Personnel (Administration)/Student Affairs Administration [however you would like to call it]. After working for an office of my choice, I would like to begin eventually working part-time as a consultant taking on only a few clients. Another certification I would need is a College Educational Planner (CEP) certification by the IECA (Independent Educational Consultants Association) by UC Irvine.  
The other thing is that I have considered is a doctoral degree; however with the topic matter of college planning and transition, I am not sure what doctoral degree I should be pursuing or even if a doctoral degree should be something looking towards. One of the reasons, I would want to pursue one is to understand educational issues at the secondary level of education, how that impacts college readiness,  and what can be done about that in present day. I also would like to focus on diversity, inclusion, and equity measures for all students to have the opportunity to apply for college with the vary degree of diversity in our society today. The only degrees I have seen that would be compatible are the Ph.D or the Ed.D. When I was looking, I was more attracted to the Ed.D. In my opinion, the Ph.D I don't think would meet my goals necessarily since I want to span outwards in having my own small business. I could be missing something but do you all have any input? I know that educational leadership is the main umbrella term which this falls under but are there some specific areas of some programs that you all would recommend I start looking?
