In Trump's Executive Order 13769 would Sunni Muslims in Iraq be considered a Religious Minority
From the text:

>the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, is further directed to make changes, to the extent permitted by law, to prioritize refugee claims made by individuals on the basis of religious-based persecution,  provided that the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individualâ€™s country of nationality.

Considering that Sunni Muslims are a religious minority according to [Iraq Religions 2014](http://gulf2000.columbia.edu/images/maps/Iraq_Religions_2014_lg.png) would this mean that potential refugee claims for Sunni Muslims would be prioritized over the Shiite majority.

Considering that ISIS is basically from the Sunni community, and those fighting ISIS with US and western backing are Shiites, this sounds like it would be exactly opposite what the government would intend.
