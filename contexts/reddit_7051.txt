Has anyone worked for as a employee for a small local business?
Something like maybe a pool cleaning company or a lawn care company, house renovating company or things like that sorta small local businesses if that makes sense.

I'm from Florida so theres a lot of these little business out there was wondering what its like to work for them as i'm seeing a few listing on Craigslist about it. Specifically a pool cleaning business they give you a truck and train you up seems more fun than working a desk job.

If anyone can share their experience with this top of job and what the pay was like i'd appreciate it!
