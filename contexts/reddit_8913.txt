What new information about links between the Russian government and the Trump campaign have we learned from the Mueller report?
In [his report](https://www.justice.gov/storage/report.pdf)^1 released with redactions today, Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller said:

>[T]he Special Counsel's investigation established that
Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election principally through two operations. First, a
Russian entity carried out a social media campaign that favored presidential candidate Donald J.
Trump and disparaged presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Second, a Russian intelligence
service conducted computer-intrusion operations against entities, employees, and volunteers
working on the Clinton Campaign and then released stolen documents. The investigation also
identified numerous links between the Russian government and the Trump Campaign. Although
the investigation established that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump
presidency and worked to secure that outcome, and that the Campaign expected it would benefit  electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts, the investigation did not
establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian
government in its election interference activities.^2



* What if any of the "numerous links between the Russian government and the Trump Campaign" were not previously known to the public before this report?

Special request:  **Please cite volume and page numbers when referencing the report.**

This thing is an absolute beast of a document clocking in over 400 pages.  It is broken into two volumes, volume 1 on Russian interference efforts and links to the Trump campaign, and volume 2 on obstruction of justice.  Each volume has its own page numbers.  So when citing anything from the report, please say a page *and volume* number.

If you cite the report without a page number we will not consider that a proper source, because it's too difficult to check.
