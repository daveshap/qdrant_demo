CECILE: Want to join me?
SEBASTIAN: Some other time, Cecile.
CECILE: Am I suppose to be this sore?
SEBASTIAN: For the first time, yes. It'll pass.
CECILE: I like it better when I'm on top.
SEBASTIAN: Cecile. This is what I like to call quiet time. This is time when we reflect on what we've done.
CECILE: I'm sorry.
SEBASTIAN: You think?
CECILE: Is it me?
SEBASTIAN: No, you were fine.
