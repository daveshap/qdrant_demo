I wish I wasn’t so worried all the time. I wish I was actually brave for once. I wish I didn’t always think about what others think about me. I wish I could let go of the past. But I can’t.
For the longest time, I’ve had this dream that I’ll be a musician. Singing songs and making people happy. Making myself happy. I’ve wrote songs before, I’ve played many instruments before, I’ve spent hours playing around secretly in GarageBand. I took singing lessons for a while. In the 4th grade I was in the 5th grade music class, because apparently I was ahead of my classmates. I played piano, and took up drums for a while. 

I quit singing lessons last year. The violin is gone now. And every once in a while on some stupid magical moment, I play piano. But I still long for music.


Even with drawing, which I put my heart and soul into, I still long for music.


Even when sewing, I sing. 


Even when I’m outside, I sing and sing and cry. Because I’m so weak.

I’m weak because I couldn’t sing in front of others. I’m weak because I’m so shy. I’m weak because I couldn’t even sing properly with my singing teacher. I never let go.


I’m so mad at myself. I want to let this dream go, but I don’t at the same time. Isn’t it enough for me? Art, drawing, and sewing? Why do I still cling to music? I can’t sing. I sound horrible when I’m standing in front of people. My legs shake and I cry. I can’t even sing outside anymore, because I’m afraid of neighbors hearing. I can only sing with headphones on because even I judge myself. I’m my worst enemy. 



Why do I STILL want to sing? Why do I still find myself singing when I can? Why can’t I just let this stupid dream go? This stupid worthless dream. I’m going to art school to draw, which I’m still bad at. I’m not going for music. 


I want to let go of song. But I don’t at the same time. I’m stuck yet again. I don’t know why I’m here.


I just needed to vent.
