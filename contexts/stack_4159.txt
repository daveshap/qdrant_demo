Travelling to Ireland with UK short-term student visa with no BIVS endorsement (Indian passport) I am an Indian passport holder. I am currently on university exchange in the UK using my UK Type C Short-term Student Visa (i.e. NOT a Tier 4 long-term student visa). My UK visa is valid for 180 days. This visa was issued in India.I would like to visit Dublin, ROI for a few days during my university break. While it appears that I meet the criteria for the Irish short stay visa waiver programme, my visa does not mention anything about a \"BIVS endorsement\".Can I still travel to Ireland for a few days regardless, considering that I meet all other criteria?If not, then is there a way for me to apply for a BIVS endorsement on my pre-existing UK visa without having to apply for a separate Irish visa altogether? (Assuming that would be the faster route.)If not, then how do I apply for and be issued an Irish visa soon? The Irish visa website mentions that it may take up to 8 weeks; however, I would want to travel to Ireland in March (it is February now)  and also travel to other countries in the meanwhile.
