WILDER: You don't get in without one. It's like a gentlemen's club for illusionists. Except most of us aren't gentlemen.
HARRY: Are they all in the business?
WILDER: It's not a business. Harry. It's a vocation.
WILDER: That's what they call the Repository. Every magic secret known to man's locked up in that room.
HARRY: Have you been in?
WILDER: No. There's only three keys. Vinovich has got one, of course. He's a little crazy, by the way. And he's a mean drunk. Otherwise, he's a real charmer.
