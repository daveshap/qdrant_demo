Just went 1 hour to a friend's gig but didn't go in.
Lighter than most stuff on this sub but want get this off my chest. 

Some friends of mine (which I don't see very often) have a band and had a gig in a bar and asked me if I wanted to come. I said maybe( I'm a little socially anxious so I don't like to commit in the case I don't come). So today I went about 1 hour by train to get to the bar. As I go in I see some guy I know sitting there on a table with his friends and I immediatly leave. 
I know that guy from my school time - even though we didn't really have contact - and met him at the last gig where we had just a short awkward chat before I isolated myself for the rest of the evening. 
The thought of spending the whole evening there with his friends either awkwardly trying to make conversation or just sitting there quietly like a wierd loner scared the shit out of me.

Well, just now I'm going riding home and I plan to drink a beer and play Overwatch. Feels like another evening on my road to social isolation. 
Don't take this too seriously, just need to get this off my chest.

Cheers.
