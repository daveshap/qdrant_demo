How do you know what you're doing with your job?
Yesterday, I was talking to my uncle about my job search and he mentioned how he's heard of people saying that they see their co-workers all the time not having a clue about how to do their jobs. I'm preparing for a couple of interviews and while reviewing these job descriptions, I'm wondering if I'll know how to do my job correctly if I get hired. I definitely don't want to be known as someone who doesn't know anything.
