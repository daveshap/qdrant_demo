CHILI: Okay, Harry, I'm wrong. You're not the one he's setting up.
HARRY: I mean, at least Bo's invested in three of my movies.
KAREN: Harry, we spoke with Martin.
HARRY: 'We?'
KAREN: Chili and me.
HARRY: Really.
CHILI: Yeah, he wants us to talk to Buddy, set up a meeting.
HARRY: A meeting with who? You and Karen?
KAREN: Harry -â€“
HARRY: Man's in town two days, thinks he's David O. fucking Selznick.
HARRY: So how 'bout it, Mr. Selznick, do I make my deal with Bo? Or you gonna finally help me out, have a word with your dry cleaner when you find him.
CHILI: I found him.
CHILI: Forget about Leo's money, Harry.
HARRY: You have it?
CHILI: Harry, if I gave you Leo's money you'd have Ray Bones all over your ass and then you'd be in a whole new kinda trouble.
HARRY: Who?
CHILI: Ray Barboni. Guy from Miami, owns Leo now that Momo died.
HARRY: Who the fuck is Momo? Jesus, these fucking names...
CHILI: Tell you what, Harry, tomorrow morning, when the airport's crowded, I'll go check it out. If I don't see a problem, I'll pick up the money...
