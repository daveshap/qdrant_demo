BROCK: I thought cats were supposed to have nine lives, not thirty one! What do you think you're doing?
CATWOMAN: Winning.
BROCK: What do you want from me?
CATWOMAN: At this point, a nap. Oh by the way, I killed your butler and your dog..
BROCK: My dog!
CATWOMAN: Oh Honey, it's so much better when we do it without the helmet.
BROCK: I've been thinking. I've been thinking about us. I'm sorry I've been so hard no you these past couple days. I realize now it's because you're the only woman who ever understood me and I couldn't handle it! I've never revealed myself to anyone the way I have to you. Let's blow this town together. We'll run a bed-and-breakfast in Vermont by day, and by night, we'll dress up and kill anything that...

CATWOMAN: I know, I know, a Warrior. You're very annoying..Now tell me how to defuse the bomb you've set..

CATWOMAN: You might be right, but Fun is overrated. I need something real.
BROCK: Well then, let's agree to disagree...Now how about a picture for my scrapbook?
BROCK: Don't you realize there's nothing you can do, anyway! Nine minutes and it's all over! The Fun Palace is a tomb. No one can get out. And choke on this furball: all doors and windows are blocked, locked, and electrified! Even the glass around the bomb is rigged.
CATWOMAN: Even the skylight?
BROCK: The skylight?" Fool! It's too high for anybody to climb out the damn skylight..."
CATWOMAN: What about climbing in?""
