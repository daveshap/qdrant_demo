Thoughts on building a wiki for this subreddit?
Recently I've been thinking about how a wiki could be really helpful in this subreddit for addressing topics that regularly come up such as applying to grad programs, prepping for interviews, helpful resources around the web, etc.  Is this something that other people would be interested in?  I would be willing to get things started by writing up initial information on various topics and soliciting/collecting feedback and additions.
