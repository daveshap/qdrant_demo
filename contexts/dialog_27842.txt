SONNY: Yeah.
VOICE: Do you recognize my voice?
SONNY: I think so. Detective squad?
VOICE: Right. Don't say my name, just listen. Somebody shot your father outside his place fifteen minutes ago.
SONNY: Is he alive?
VOICE: I think so, but I can't get close enough. There's a lot of blood. I'll try to find out more.
SONNY: Find out anything you can...you got a Grand coming.
