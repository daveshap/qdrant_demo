JOHNNY: What the ... ?
ZACH: What happened ?
JOHNNY: The power went out in half the park.
ZACH: How can this happen ?
JOHNNY: I don't know. I think that a power grid just needs reset. Don't get your panties in a bunch. I'll go down and reset it.
ZACH: Go in there ? What if Bruce finds you ?
JOHNNY: Yeah, right. He's stuck all the way over here
