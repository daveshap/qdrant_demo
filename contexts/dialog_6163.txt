HAL: What the hell are you doing here?!
GABE: I was with Jessie, she filled me in.
HAL: Now let me fill you in. You can get your ass back down an' go back to that hole you been hiding in--
GABE: When we get this group down, I'm gone.
HAL: You're gone now! I don't climb with people I can't trust. Why'd you come up, to prove something?
GABE: I'm here for the same reason you are, so let's do it.
HAL: Can't pass up another chance to play hero, can you.
GABE: Look, I know--
HAL: You don't know anything. You did it your way and she died.
GABE: I did what I thought was right.
HAL: Well you were wrong! It was your weight on the line that did it--
GABE: There wasn't time for anything else.
HAL: We'll never know, will we?
GABE: Look, it was a bad time for everybody.
HAL: What the hell do you know about bad time. You didn't love her, you didn't have to explain to her family.
GABE: And you weren't looking into her eyes when she fell. Now drop it!
HAL: No, buddy, it was you who dropped it!
GABE: If you want, do it. I don't care.
