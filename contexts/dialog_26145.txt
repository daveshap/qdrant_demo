LT. QUIFFER: Yeah, I got it in the thigh.
MAJOR KONG: Lieutenant Toejam, why don't you help him?
LT. TOEJAM: I thought I should check out the damage first. My gear is busted up pretty bad.
MAJOR KONG: Lieutenant Toejam's going to help you in a minute. Can you check your ECM?
LT. QUIFFER: Why can't he help me now? He's sitting two feet away from me!
MAJOR KONG: Come on, Quentin, isn't that pretty selfish, putting yourself ahead of the mission?
LT. QUIFFER: Look, I'm shot - it hurts.
MAJOR KONG: Lieutenant Quiffer, we're all sorry you were hit, and we'll help you stick it together as soon as we get squared away.
LT. QUIFFER: Look, can't someone help me?
