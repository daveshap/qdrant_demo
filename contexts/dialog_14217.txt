SAM'S VOICE: I have a big deal coming up that's going to make us all rich. George, you remember that night in Martini's bar when you told me you read someplace about making plastics out of soybeans?
GEORGE: Huh? Yeah-yeah-yeah . . . soybeans. Yeah.
SAM'S VOICE: Well, Dad's snapped up the idea. He's going to build a factory outside of Rochester. How do you like that?
GEORGE: Rochester? Well, why Rochester?
SAM'S VOICE: Well, why not? Can you think of anything better?
GEORGE: Oh, I don't know . . . why not right here? You remember that old tool and machinery works? You tell your father he can get that for a song. And all the labor he wants, too. Half the town was thrown out of work when they closed down.
SAM'S VOICE: That so? Well, I'll tell him. Hey, that sounds great! Oh, baby, I knew you'd come through. Now, here's the point. Mary, Mary, you're in on this too. Now listen. Have you got any money?
GEORGE: Money? Yeah . . . well, a little.
SAM'S VOICE: Well, now listen. I want you to put every cent you've got into our stock, you hear? And George, I may have a job for you; that is, unless you're still married to that broken-down Building and Loan. This is the biggest thing since radio, and I'm letting you in on the ground floor. Oh, Mary . . . Mary . . .
