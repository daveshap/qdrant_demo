What are the drawbacks to automatically deleting web server access logs? What would be the downsides to either disabling or automatically deleting web server access logs that are older than 7-10 days?I'd like to limit how long I store personally-identifiable data (IP address) for my visitors but would also like to strike a balance with regard to security. Would I be losing anything important if I were to disable logs or just didn't notice something wrong with the site until after the logs had been deleted?
