MICHAEL: Hoity-toity! John Best, what's the matter here?
CAPTAIN BEST: I'll tell you what it is, Mr. Dugan. I have had enough of Miss Dugan here and your Irish ways. I ain't used to 'em, sir.
MICHAEL: Well, well! What is it? We'll make you used to our ways, or adopt English ones.
CAPTAIN BEST: It's not the English way, for ladies to have two lovers, and, so, Mr. Dugan, I'll thank you to pay me the sum you owe me, and I resign all claims to this young lady. If she has a fancy for school-boys, let her take 'em, sir.
MICHAEL: Pooh! Pooh! Best, you are joking.
CAPTAIN BEST: I never was more in earnest.
