QGIS working with a point and polygon layer I have 2 layers, layer A ( point data) and layer B (polygon data).   Within layer A I want a column which will indicate Yes or No if a polygon is within 500m.  I have created a 500m buffer for layer b and have currently used the geomtouchs function to select those polygons.  I can't get it to fill the column with Yes or No though.  Has anyone any other methods they would use?
