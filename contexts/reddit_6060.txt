Job not Taking COVID-19 Seriously
I’m a college student working part time at a local fast food place.  I’ve only been working three weeks but have been becoming increasingly concerned about my COVID risk.  My county has some, but not a ton, of reported cases.

My coworkers do not believe that coronavirus is “real”.  They believe pretty much every conspiracy theory about it.  There is no social distancing inside the store (it wouldn’t be possible), and those not directly handling customers don’t wear masks.  From the conversations I hear my coworkers have, they have been living “normally” outside of work, not wearing masks, going shopping whenever they want, visiting other peoples houses.

The most concern I have is from a coworker that called off sick with a fever today.  I asked a manager about if that employee would be allowed to return to work within two weeks.  I was given a non-answer about how that employee calls off sick whenever she doesn’t want to come in, and “it’s probably not covid”.  I’m scheduled to work with this employee in a few days.  She refuses to wear a mask even when interacting with customers.  Additionally, I found out today that the health department has been calling our store because customers are reporting that not all employees are wearing masks (which is true).

I don’t know what to do.  I live with someone 65+, and my family takes care of another vulnerable person.  My current game-plan is to go to work when scheduled, see if the (sick?) employee is there, and talk to our head manager regardless.  I’m worried that sharing my concern with a bunch of coronavirus “truthers” could cause me to lose my job.  I don’t desperately need it, but my mother is forcing me to work (despite her being aware there is a pandemic and working from home herself).
