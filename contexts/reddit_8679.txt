Has there been progress towards a US Federal budget since the shutdown ended?
The US federal government re-opened for 3 weeks (https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/25/politics/congress-reopens-government-shutdown/index.html); ever since then, I've heard very little of negotiations or bills. Has there been any progress or is it just unreported?
