JACKIE: This looks pretty good on me.
AMY: Are you kidding, it looks great. You wear this to a business meeting, you're the badass in the room. But you can go out dancing in this too. It's a total power suit.
JACKIE: I think I'm gonna just get this for today. I'm in kind of a hurry. Would you mind ringing this up while I change out of it?
AMY: Not a problem.
JACKIE: Thanks.
MELANIE: Jackie?
JACKIE: Hi, Melanie.
MELANIE: Are you getting that black suit?
JACKIE: Yeah, do you like it?
MELANIE: It looks good on you.
JACKIE: Do you got something for me?
MELANIE: You betcha.
