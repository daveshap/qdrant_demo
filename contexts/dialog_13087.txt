MR. WILLIS: We gotta break it open.
NAISH: I ain't got a warrant.
MR. WILLIS: Tell it to my daughter.
NAISH: Shit... fuck procedure.
MOTHER: Well hello, officer.
WYDELL: Excuse me, I'm sorry for disturbing you this fine afternoon.
MOTHER: Aw, you ain't disturbing me, but it kind of looks like rain, don't ya think?
WYDELL: My name is Lt. Wydell, I'd like to ask you a few questions.
MOTHER: Questions? Well, heck, I'll tell you anything you want to know.
WYDELL: I appreciate your cooperation. I'm looking for a missing girl... ...this girl here, Denise Willis... have you seen her?
MOTHER: Well, I... mmmmm... no, I ain't seen her, sorry.
WYDELL: Please, could I please come in and talk to you for a minute? Maybe you could take a better look at the picture... might stir up something.
MOTHER: I um... no, I don't think so...
WYDELL: Please, just a minute.
MOTHER: Oh, alright... I guess I can trust you... being a man of the law and all.
WYDELL: Thank you.
MOTHER: Oh, you are very welcome... Lord knows how I love a man in uniform.
NAISH: Jesus Christ.
MR. WILLIS: Call Wydell.
WYDELL: Think... do any of these kids look familiar in any way?
MOTHER: No, I can't say that I ever seen 'em before... ...he looks familiar, is he on TV?
NAISH: Wydell.
WYDELL: Excuse me for a second.
WYDELL: Over.
NAISH: We found one.
