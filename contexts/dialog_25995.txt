MARCUS: What do you want?
VI: Don't be so upset. It's OK...
MARCUS: What the fuck are you talking about? What's OK?
VI: You know he hated my story also.
MARCUS: Your story was terrible!
VI: Marcus...You'll write something better next time!
MARCUS: Patronizing fuck! If you had just been honest with me in the first place I wouldn't have read it. I knew it was shit. But - idiot! - I believed you!
VI: That's not fair! I was honest! Just because I wasn't sucking up like 	that bitch Catherine.
MARCUS: Well, I sure didn't hear you voice your opinion in there when it mattered.
VI: I admit it - I was scared! I was shocked, in fact , by what he said. And he's so...convincing. I'm sorry if I let you down, but really, I still say he's just one opinion. I don't even like his books that much. They're all so aggressively confrontational. I don't care if he's won the Pulitzer Prize.
