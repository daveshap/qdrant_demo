Got into grad school, trying to get a new job. Best course of action?
I plan to go part time and work full time. I have no idea how to tell employers this, or when to tell them in the interview process. Do I tell them just as I get an offer and risk it being rescinded? Before the offer? 

Point is, I just really dislike where I work now and I donâ€™t know if I can stay for another 2-3 years while pursuing a degree. Plus, at another job, I would be able to use what I learn in class more probably.
