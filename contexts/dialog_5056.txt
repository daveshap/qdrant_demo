CRASH: I don't believe in fighting.
EBBY: Pussy.
CRASH: Take the first shot at me.
EBBY: I ain't hitting a man first.
CRASH: Hit me in the chest with this...
EBBY: I'd kill ya.
CRASH: From what I hear you couldn't hit a bull in the ass with a slingshot
EBBY: Don't try me.
CRASH: Throw it. C'mon, right in the chest.
EBBY: No way.
CRASH: C'mon, Meat. You can't hit me 'cause you're starting to think about it already, you're starting to think how embarrassing it'll be to miss, how all these people would laugh. C'mon, Rook--show me that million dollar arm 'cause I'm getting a good idea about the five cent head--
