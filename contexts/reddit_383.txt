Am I a hopeless romantic?

My girlfriend of 6 months and I have had a very stressful past month in our relationship. We have been very open and honest with eachother,  and she feels as though she loves me, but not in a romantic way.  She thinks that the spark is gone and we can’t reignite it. I personally, while it is wrong of me to assume what is going on in her mind, think that those is because of her self-esteem issues and her worrying that she has to make me happy (the latter of which we openly discussed, and I have told her that I’m always happy with her, and that she doesn’t need to jump through hoops to please me). She decided it was best if we break things off yesterday, which didn’t surprise me, but hurts nonetheless.  I told her that I would be here for her always. I’ve always been there for her, and I’ve never hurt her in any way. Anyway, I’m asking reddit if there’s anything I can really do to save our relationship, or find the spark. I’m willing to give more information if I haven’t said enough. (TL;DR Guys please just read it)
