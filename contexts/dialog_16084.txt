RAY: Are you trying to tell me after all this time you finally have a plan for busting out of here?
CLAUDE: Shh! Is that so hard to believe?
RAY: Don't tell me, I don't want to hear it. It's probably all fucked up, anyway.
CLAUDE: You don't want to hear it, you don't want to hear it. There's no shame in that.
RAY: It's too late for plans.
CLAUDE: Never thought I'd hear Ray Gibson say that. Hell with you then. You'd only slow me down anyway.
