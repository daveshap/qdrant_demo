DELTOID: You are now a murderer, little Alex. A murderer, yes.
ALEX: Not true, sir. It was only a slight tolchock. She was breathing, I swear it.
DELTOID: I've just come back from the hospital. Your victim has died.
ALEX: You try to frighten me, sir, admit so, sir. This is some new form of torture. Say it, brother, sir.
DELTOID: It will be your own torture. I hope to God it will torture you to madness.
