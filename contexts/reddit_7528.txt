Online Masters of Social Work Programs?
I am seeking advice about online grad school programs. I live in Ohio and have 15+ years’ experience but only have a Bachelor’s Degree. Did most of my undergrad at Ohio State and the last 2 semesters at Wright State University. I am considering both schools for my grad degree and I’ve also been looking into many online programs. So many out there seem great...It’s overwhelming. Any tips or info to share? Thanks!!

(Apologies in advance if this has been posted before, but I searched and I could not find anything.)
