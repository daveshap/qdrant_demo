MUMFORD: Be specific.
SOFIE: Well... I'm tired all the time, obviously. I always feel like taking a nap. But when I try to sleep, I have trouble. My muscles ache. And my joints. I feel like an old person, or like I did back when I used to work out too hard... What else?...
MUMFORD: Sore throat?
SOFIE: Uh-huh.
