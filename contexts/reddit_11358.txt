Still thinking about you
Every single day. Sure, some days are worse than others, but even if it's for just a moment, not a day has passed. I miss you and I hope you're doing well. I'm doing great, don't get me wrong, but your presence is and will always be sorely missed. I don't think I'll ever hear from you again and I accept that, but it still makes me sad.
