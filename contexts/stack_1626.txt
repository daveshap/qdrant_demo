Question regarding voltage and current Please forgive me if this question sounds stupid but I am still an amateur.I was trying to power a DC motor a while ago and blew a transistor. Later I realized that it was rated for 200mA and I exceeded that with my batteries. Anyway then I wondered how to solve this problem. Should I get a transistor that can handle more current or should I step up the voltage (and as I understand decrease the current) so that I don't blow the transistor but still get enough power to the motor (a rather small one). I was also wandering if it is a good idea (in general) to step up the voltage and in doing so decease current (correct me if I'm wrong) to protect components that can only handle like 200mA or it it better to get components that can handle more current.Again I'm a bit nooby so please correct me if I'm wrong.
