MIKE: You don't want to know.
CLAIRE: Oh, I do want to know. I tried to reach you at the precinct.
MIKE: I've moved into Scotty's... Good news about T.J., though. Looks like that tough son of a gun is gonna pull through.
CLAIRE: Oh God, that's great!
MIKE: Are you okay?
CLAIRE: Oh, I'm fine. They've replaced you with quite an entourage. It's a regular marching band". You should see me on the street
CLAIRE: I'm taking them all out to Queens, as a matter of fact, right in your neighborhood. There's an event at my Father's school... an anniversary... I thought maybe you could come...
MIKE: Oh that thing in Queens.
CLAIRE: I'm going away after that, the next morning.
MIKE: Where?
CLAIRE: Pretty far. I'm told not to say anything about it on the phone, in case it's tapped... they think it's best, safer, if I go away, at least till Venza's found.
MIKE: When can I see you?
CLAIRE: I don't know. Garber's left orders here not to let you in the building.
MIKE: Oh yeah. When is it? This thing in Queens.
CLAIRE: Tomorrow night. Can you come?
MIKE: I don't know. It wouldn't be very smart.
CLAIRE: Listen, you're right. Don't do it. I'll just... send you an address, okay?
MIKE: Claire...
CLAIRE: No really, it's okay, I've gotta go. I'm expecting some calls. I'll be fine, really.
MIKE: I'll think about Wednesday.
