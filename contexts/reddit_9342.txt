Just, this morning, made my last credit card payment!
I'm still waiting for the confirmation email, but I just paid my last credit card payment and I wanted to share it with someone because it's such a relief!

I still have other debts to focus on, but having one out of the way helps me stay motivated to keep going!  I've been trying to focus on reducing my debt for about two years now.  Until recently, I simply wasn't making enough money to really make any progress toward my goals.  I was taking a ton of credits in school and paying for that out of pocket and, because of my school schedule, I was working a crappy job with flexible hours but garbage pay.  I started selling as much random old stuff as I could on eBay to make some extra cash.  Then traded in my car for a cheaper, more efficient car.  I found a better job, closer to home, with better pay.  I have also chosen to ride my bike to work a LOT (about 8 miles one-way), but it's getting incredibly cold/windy/rainy where I live so I might take a few months off of that!!  I will say, that time spent commuting by bike really helped my mental state in so many ways, I think exercise is so important, especially when life is getting you down because of things like finances.

If you asked me this time last year if I would've been able to do all of this, I would've said no way.  I was drowning and though there was no way to get out.  I was getting so anxious about my debt that I couldn't sleep.  Some nights I would just lay awake and sweat profusely from the anxiety of it all.  But with little steps, I'm making progress!  Thanks for listening to my story/rant, I hope maybe it can help someone else who is where I was only a year ago!
