I really like my friend and I have for over a year, I can’t get over it!
So I really like my family friend, I so badly just want to tell him, but I am so scared of rejection(as it’s a family friend)  he is my age and really cute, he seems close to me, he has put his arm round me before, and laid his head on my shoulders, he also seems to always sit really close to me- not to others, and I have been watching. I might be just looking for signs though so I don’t know. I really really like him, I don’t know if he feels the same way. My annoying little sister, who’s 13, thinks he might like me as he completely ignores her when I am around and apparently acts differently. I really need advice, I am 16, I have pretty much no relationship expieriance and have never even kissed anyone, it’s not that I haven’t met people and had the opportunity, it’s just I’m so hung up over this guy, since dating became an actual thing!! I need to get over it somehow so I can either be with him, or join the dating world! But how!! Please give me advice, I need help, thanks :)
