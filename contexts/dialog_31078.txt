SANTOS: I got your message... But you went right to Johnnie, didn't you?... I can't trust you, bitch - not for one minute... Naughty girl... Sailor and Lula are headed west, and guess what? There's no turning back. I'm in a killing mood.

SANTOS: My very best to Johnnie... Bless his soul.
JOHNNIE: Who was that?... Who know's your here?
MARIETTA: I'll be damned if that wasn't a wrong number?
