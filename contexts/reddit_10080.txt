Need Advice for Graduate Assistantship Interview
This week I'll be flying out to Norfolk, VA for Graduate Assistantship interviews. This is the first time I'll be interviewing for a GA and the institution I'll be interviewing at is very special to me because it's where I did my NUFP internship this past summer.

I'm looking for advice on attire, the interview process, etc.
