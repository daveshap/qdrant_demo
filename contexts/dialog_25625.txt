SECURITY GUARD: Is there a reward in this?
SHERMIN: Huh?... Eh... no, there isn't
SECURITY GUARD: Because I'm the one who called the police, you know.
SHERMIN: Yeah, thanks. We appreciate that.
SECURITY GUARD: Hey, it's none of my business why you're chasing a retard... You want my opinion, it's the girl. She had to hold the guy's hand all the way to the car like he was a kid.
SHERMIN: You saw that?
SECURITY GUARD: Hey... he didn't look like no big time criminal to me.
SECURITY GUARD: Eh... the store tells you to call when there's trouble, so they won't get sued... But that shouldn't matter if there's a reward, right?
SHERMIN: I wouldn't think so.
SECURITY GUARD: That's what I thought. So remember it was me because sometimes rewards come late, you know.
SHERMIN: We will. Something's wrong here. She's helping him now.
LYMAN: I know. She bought him a ticket for Lathrop Wells and put him on the bus. He didn't stay on though and they drove off together.
SHERMIN: Doesn't make sense.
LYMAN: Maybe he's turned her into one of them. They enter the crowd around the helicopter.
JENNY: Why did your ship land on this planet... on Earth?
STAR MAN: It was a mistake.
JENNY: You thought we were a different planet?!
STAR MAN: No. My ship was doing a map of all the suns and...
JENNY: Stars... When a sun is far away, we call it a 'star.'
STAR MAN: We were doing a map of the stars and all the other things up there when we saw a small ship. My... eh... we kidnapped it. On it there was a map that said how to come to Earth. This was very important. Before then, we thought we were the only people in all the stars.
JENNY: You did? That's funny. So did we.
STAR MAN: Yes?
JENNY: Yes.
STAR MAN: We told our home, and the people who tell us what to do on my planet said to come and look but not to talk, not to land, not to shoot. Just to look from up there. We came and... the driver of my ship...
JENNY: The captain...
STAR MAN: The captain wanted to land to see close and to get some things from Earth to take home. The police came and shot at us. One of the people from my ship was killed.
JENNY: Oh, that's terrible. I'm sorry. Was he a good friend?
STAR MAN: I don't understand 'friend.'
JENNY: A friend is a person that is good to you... someone you like to be with... someone you like to laugh with...
STAR MAN: He was a good friend... The captain took the ship away fast and I was not in the ship.
JENNY: The police shouldn't have started shooting. But you can hardly blame them. You surprised them. They didn't know you were up there. When they saw you, they thought you were here to hurt us.
STAR MAN: I understand.
JENNY: Sounds like your captain's going to get hell when he gets back home.
STAR MAN: What is hell?
JENNY: It's bad.
STAR MAN: He will.
JENNY: What are you doing?
STAR MAN: Are you my friend?
JENNY: Yes.
STAR MAN: I am your friend.
