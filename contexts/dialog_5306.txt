BORELLI: You gotta go back there and talk to that guy.
PISCANO: Come on, go back there? I never got paid my expenses for the last trip.
BORELLI: What expenses?
PISCANO: Well, I'm goin' all over, layin' money out of my own pocket, and I never get anything back. What the hell's goin' on?
BORELLI: You gotta go back out there.
PISCANO: Well, then, from now on, I'm gonna start keepin' records.
BORELLI: Artie, no records, Artie. What are you gonna do with records? Pay taxes?
PISCANO: Well, I keep layin' out my own fuckin' dough for these trips and nothin' ever comes back. I mean, what hell's goin' on? What are we doin' over here?
BORELLI: You're goin' out to Las Vegas, you're havin' a good time at my expense. What the fuck? I mean, after all, you're the one having a good time, not me.
