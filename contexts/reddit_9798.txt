Is a masters program worthwhile if you can afford the tuition but were not able to secure an assistantship?
I was accepted into a higher ed masters program for this fall (background is I have no experience in the field) but I did not receive any offers for the assistantships I applied to. Now I have seen many people in higher education comment on how this is not a degree to go into debt for but I can pay for the entire program with the money I have saved. What worries me is missing out on the experience, both in terms of personal growth and my CV.
