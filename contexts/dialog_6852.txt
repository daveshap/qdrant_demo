GREG: Annette Harrison? I don't know what you're talking about.
SEBASTIAN: Come on Greg. You're the only one who knows her. The truth will save you.
GREG: I swear on my life, I never said a word to her about you.
BLAINE: I think he's telling the truth Valmont. Greg couldn't write a grocery list let alone a letter.
SEBASTIAN: Alright, I believe you. Stop crying. Your secret's safe with me.
