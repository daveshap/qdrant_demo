College Admission Bribery Scandal
Shock, outrage, scandal!  Honestly, who is surprised?  Rich people paying to get their children into elite colleges.  Maybe a little more dishonest than previously, but isn't this how it works for rich people?  Work the system, pay some money, get your mediocre child into a top 40.  We all know that there are lists at schools of students you don't mess with, the untouchables, the students that get the best rooms, the administrative doors open for them, and they get what they want.  Money makes the world go round.

Is anyone really clutching their pearls on this one????  (not saying it is right, just being honest)
