Is it really easier to meet girls/women at university?
So I'm in my second year at uni (21 Y/O) at the moment and I'm constantly bummed out by the fact I am alone. I have always been reserved around other people (thanks to my high functioning Aspergerâ€™s), and generally only talk to a couple of close friends on the course. I want to talk to more people (especially girls) but I can't start conversations and have to wait until they talk to me - which happens once in a blue moon.

I live at home and, as you can well guess, am not the type to go out or socialise with people. I have never had a girlfriend in my entire life, but have had crushes and been in love with girls before, it just sucks when that is not reciprocated. My lack of general socialisation has turned me into a cynic on the world, and I need a connection to make that better.

What doesn't help about living at home is I end up spending way too much time with my parents. They're literally the only people I'll end up soeaking to for weeks on end since most of my friends live quite far away from me. 

I might be romanticising the whole "true love waits" thing, but I need to escape the social paradox of shyness, as well as having a trusting, female companion. I have felt like this for the past few years. Any help with how to improve my self and approach people, or how to stop feeling lonely?
