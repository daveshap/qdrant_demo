[META] Our plan for the Mueller Report
The Justice Department [has stated](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/15/us/politics/mueller-report-release.html) that they intend to release a redacted version of the report of special counsel Robert Mueller Thursday morning.  

Because the report is ["nearly 400 pages"](https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/724-barr-mueller-report-letter/67bcb7e31e2c8ab26c7c/optimized/full.pdf) we do not think it would be productive to immediately have a discussion thread about it, because people will need time to read it.  However, we also know people use NP as a source for finding good quality sources.

Our plan tomorrow is then twofold:

1. As soon as possible after the report is out, we will put up a post with a link to it, but the post will be locked to comments.

2. After a few hours of the report being out, we will either make a new discussion thread or open up comments on the link post (I'm open to user suggestions on which of these is better).

We are posting this now as a precommitment so that it is not unexpected by our users, and to ensure that this is our plan in advance, and not a response to any content of the report.
