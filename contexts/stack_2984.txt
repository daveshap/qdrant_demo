How does Newton's corpuscular theory explain the speeding up of corpuscles when entering a denser medium? I can't find an explanation for this anywhere. Intuition would imply that the corpuscle would slow down. I mean a person running at a constant speed enters a crowd of people or a forest. The presence of obstacles would cause a reduction in velocity. How did Newton think it would speed up the particles ?
