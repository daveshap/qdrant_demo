Unconditional to uni, how can do I find the motivation to keep working with no conditions to meet?
I have an unconditional to my first choice university, in other words I already have a place at uni. Because of this I am finding it really hard to find the motivation to study for school. I no longer NEED to do well so I find my self caring less and being distracted easier. 

I've know I should work hard to make my transition to uni easier and as employers will look at my school grades.

Is there anyway I can be motivated again to study? I am on holiday at the moment and find myself procrastinating most of the time.

Note : My courses are based on final exams only
