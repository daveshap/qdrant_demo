ROBY: Look at that.
HUNTER: What is it -- I can't tell anything --
ROBY: It's some kind of organ -- it's inserted some kind of tube or something down his throat.
HUNTER: Oh... God...
ROBY: I think that's how it's getting oxygen to him.
HUNTER: It doesn't make any sense. It paralyzes him... puts him into a coma... then keeps him alive.
MELKONIS: We can't expect to understand a life form like this. We're out of our back yard. Things are different here.
HUNTER: Well, can't we kill it? I mean, we can't leave the damn thing on him.
MELKONIS: We don't know what might happen if we tried to kill it. At least right now it's keeping him alive.
HUNTER: How about cutting it off? We can't pull it loose, but we can cut off everything but the bottom layer, where it's stuck to his face.
