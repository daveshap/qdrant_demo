I really hate my life.
I'm tired of this shit. I can't believe that I'm 27 years and I'm the way I am. I'm still stuck on a dead end job and can't figure out what I like to do for a stable career. I still live at my grandmothers place and still haven't gotten my shit straight to get on with my life. Im literally a fucking loser. I hate that I put myself in this situation. I have no social life or no friends so in order to keep myself busy I have no choice but to go to my moms house where she acts narcissistic. I feel like I stuck myself like this because I'm afraid to put myself out there and break away from this comfort zone I'm in. I've always been afraid to get too involved with other people and I isolate myself. I don't know why I'm like this. It's now taking a toll on me and I don't know what to do anymore. I'm just tired of this lifestyle and it's only causing more stress. I still can't even choose a career. I'm tired of feeling like I can't financially support myself if I move out. I'm just a empty human being. I don't even know what my problem is and why I'm doing this to myself.
