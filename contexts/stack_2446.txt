Seeking process in ModelBuilder that can choose among several shapefiles in folder? I created a model in ArcGIS 10 which selects those parcels that intersect my polygon shapefile. It will then remove all r.o.w parcels. I then export the table it produces to an excel file. The shapefiles are in a folder.Is there a process which will direct ModelBuilder to said folder then prompt me as to which shapefile I want to run without using python?
