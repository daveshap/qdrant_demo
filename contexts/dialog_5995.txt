CANDY: Please don't make me say it again.
HOMER: No, that's not it--I just want to be sure I understand you.
HOMER: I *helped* you not to think about Wally. You were so upset--you couldn't stand worrying about him, about his being killed and not coming back-- but when you were with me, you could stop worrying... well, for a while, anyway. This is how I helped you, right?
CANDY: Please... that's enough. I *loved* you, too--you know I did.
HOMER: ...did." Well
CANDY: Please don't...
HOMER: And now that Wally's coming back, and because he'll certainly *need* you...
CANDY: You say that as though it's some awful thing! I never stopped loving Wally!
