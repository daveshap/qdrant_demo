Starting new job (internal) - How can I be more effective in learning?
I'm feeling a bit nervous. I am not expected to know everything, but I am expected to learn quick and perform well. It's giving me a bit of anxiety because I've been doing my past role for 8 years and do it in my sleep. This will be taking me out of my comfort zone.

What advice would you give me?

My concern is also asking too many questions and annoying people. Is there any way to diminish someone from being irritated by the new guy?
