Does anyone else experience huge anxiety depression and a feeling of doom when you first wake up?
It doesn't seem to matter how good of a day I had the day before or what happened it seems I always wake up with lots of depression and anxiety that doesn't fade away until two or 3pm. It seems as though my Day is predetermined, Some mornings for whatever reason I wake up with no anxiety or depression and its like I'm a completely different person. Its almost guaranteed that that day will be a good day but the next day is usually back to the same old feeling in the morning that take all day to overcome. I feel like if i could replicate the few days i don't wake up with anxiety that my situation would improve.
