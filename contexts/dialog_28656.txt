EPPS: Yeah! Welcome to beautiful Iraq. Land of enchantment and riches.
WES: Oh, God.
JAEGER: You're such a pussy, you know that? How'd you get in the army?
EPPS: Cool it, Jaeger. Hey, Wes? Wes?
WES: What?
EPPS: I know you think this is crazy, but a couple of hours from now you're going to be one rich dude trying to buy up every other puzzle box out there.
WES: I'd settle for being alive. Really. Alive would be fine.
JAEGER: Epps, is that a sand dune.
WES: Oh, no.
EPPS: Why, yes, Jaeger. I believe it is.
WES: No, please, not again.
