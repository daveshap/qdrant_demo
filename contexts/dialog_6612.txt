MICHAEL: I was brilliant, or at least boringly sane.
LETTY: So there were no problems?
MICHAEL: Not a one.
LETTY: And did you go to the mission?
LETTY: Just checking.
MICHAEL: I saw Paul leaving. Did you do the dirty deed?
LETTY: Yeah.
MICHAEL: So, it's over?
LETTY: All over. Did you see your new apartment?
LETTY: Furnished?

MICHAEL: I better make a list.
LETTY: List schmist. You'll remember.
