TOBY: 'Cause I'm just like dynamite. And when I go off, somebody gets hurt.
BOBBY: Fine. I was making time with your girl. Now I'm scared to death and I learned my lesson. Now can you go away?
TOBY: Not before I settle with you, chickenshit!
BOBBY: Christ, I don't believe this!
TOBY: Stand up.
BOBBY: I wasn't hitting on your girl!
TOBY: Stand up, Mister, or I'll beat you where you sit.
