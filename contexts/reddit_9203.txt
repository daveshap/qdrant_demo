If you are in the U.S. and can't afford insurance you should know about K health
Like many others I lost my job and insurance due to the pandemic. I woke up with a abscess tooth and had no way to pay to go the urgent care.
So I did a little research (after panicking) and learned about an app called K health. It is $20 the first time you use it to chat with a doctor online, and then they send in a prescription to your pharmacy. They automatically did a cheaper prescription and applied goodrx. I got antibiotics for $11 and picked them up about two hours later. 

While this obviously isn't a long term solution it is SUPER useful if you are in a pinch like I was. They also do anxiety and depression medicine! 

I realize this sounds like an ad but it definitely isn't, I was just do relieved and I thought it could help other people
