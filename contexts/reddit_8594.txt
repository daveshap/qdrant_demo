What are the First Amendment implications now that Cowboys owner Jerry Jones has stated that players will be benched if they do not stand for the national anthem?
This Sunday, Cowboys owner Jerry Jones stated that any player that disrespects the flag, will not play.  While, undoubtedly NFL teams have the right to dictate player behavior on (and off) the field, this right seems to have been complicated by President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence's actions and words.

There is evidence that President Trump is attempting to influence/encourage/suggest a change in NFL policy, per twitter @realDonaldTrump:

>Sports fans should never condone players that do not stand proud for their National Anthem or their Country. NFL should change policy!

>If NFL fans refuse to go to games until players stop disrespecting our Flag & Country, you will see change take place fast. Fire or suspend!

This week Vice President Mike Pence publicly left an NFL football game after members of the 49ers kneeled during the national anthem.  This would appear to be a direct escalation and encouragement of Trump's above tweet encouraging a public boycott.

There are also reports that President Trump called Jerry Jones 4 times the previous week, urging the owner 'not to allow his players to kneel' during the national anthem.

 So, supposing a Cowboy player is punished next week for failing to express 'adequate' respect for the flag, what are the legal implications in terms of First Amendment rights?  Can we trace a clear path from the President's words to a private citizen's punishment?  At what point does pressure (on the part of the federal government through Trump's public advocacy) reach coercion?  Has public federal advocacy here exposed NFL owners to potential liability if they follow through?  Are the Cowboys uniquely exposed due to President Trump's personal involvement?
