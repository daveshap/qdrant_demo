GIDEON: Your feet are cold.
SUZIE: Go back to sleep.
GIDEON: I asked you to wake me when Babe Brother comes.
SUZIE: You all act like two roosters.
GIDEON: I'm not going to let him get away with murder.
SUZIE: You and Babe Brother are so much alike...
GIDEON: He ain't nothing like me. How come a man has to have sons that are day and night apart? You ought to stop protecting him.
SUZIE: Hush.
GIDEON: You're always taking his side.
SUZIE: Hush.
GIDEON: I'm trying to make him a man but you keep babying him.
SUZIE: You're going to find yourself on the floor.
