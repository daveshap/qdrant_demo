Is there a term for using color to describe taste or flavor, instead of using the actual flavor? For example, if someone says \"this tastes purple\" instead of saying it tastes like grape, or if asked what flavor of Gatorade you prefer you answer with, \"blue\".It also seems common with candy and artificial flavors (or flavors perceived as artificial), and I'm wondering if there's specifically a name or term for this type of substitution.I'm specifically talking about uses that are not due to synesthesia or some other kind of disorder or medical condition.
