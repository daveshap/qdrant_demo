LUKE: I'm here.
HARRY: Did you... did you...
LUKE: Did I what?
HARRY: Did you fix the damn film? It broke in the last reel.
LUKE: I know. Everyone went home. We offered them refunds.
HARRY: Anybody take it?
LUKE: A few.
HARRY: Vultures...
HARRY: I'm not happy about this, mind you, but if I have to go, at least I'm going in my own bed, the same bed my Lily died in, and... knowing that my son is alive. That's not too shabby, is it?
LUKE: You're not going anywhere, Harry.
HARRY: Don't tell me, I know about these things. I've seen it before. It's all right. It's... all right. You're here. Oh, God, I love you, son.
