TINY TIM: So, what's our first plan of attack Santa?
SANTA: While I was in Taiwan negotiating the solution to our labor problems, I came across a factory that illegally manufactures the most addictive, Jewish pride weakening substance on the planet. I bought the entire plant.
TINY TIM: What should I charge?
SANTA: Oh, that's the beauty of it. These are free samples.
TINY TIM: So what's in the boxes? Heroin? Cocaine?
SANTA: Worse.
SANTA: Bootleg copies of the Frank Capra classic, 'It's A Wonderful Life.'
TINY TIM: That's some cold shit.
