Non-intrusive measurement of current and voltage Sorry if this question is too basic for this forum... I'm an interested amateur but far from a professional. I'd really appreciate information from someone more informed than myself.Hypothetical challenge:  Assume I have several UK mains electricity (~240v ~50Hz AC) insulated cables and have access only to the insulated exterior of the cable.Can I (hopefully accurately) determine the direction and magnitude of power flow?  Please assume that it is unacceptable to strip the insulation, or break the circuit, to insert traditional test equipment.Added: How accurate an answer can I expect to achieve, given the constraints?
