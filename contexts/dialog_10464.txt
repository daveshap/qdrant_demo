WASHINGTON: There was this anonymous pamphlet circulated at Congress which says I am personally responsible for all our hardships. And... that I have encouraged the people of America to make me into a God! Benedict, it says that I have gone mad!
ARNOLD: That can't be.
WASHINGTON: There's this whispering campaign against me ever since Gates won at Saratoga.
ARNOLD: Gates? He used my battle plan and I humbly submit that without me he'd still be back at Saratoga waiting for the British to attack. George, why haven't you moved into the Potts' house back at the creek? Much more befitting of a Commander and Chief than your field tent. And... you could entertain. I think you need to entertain more. Seriously! Get a few New Jersey whores up here, invite some Congressmen... couldn't hurt.
WASHINGTON: As soon as the men have good shelters I'll move. Perhaps Martha will join me this winter.
ARNOLD: There, then, you can have sort of a normal life.
WASHINGTON: Have you heard? The British are negotiating to make a trade for General Lee.
ARNOLD: I'm sure his dogs will be overjoyed.
WASHINGTON: The point being: he's also a candidate for my job. If we can pull this off, maybe I can restore their faith in me.
