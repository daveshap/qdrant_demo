I've been feeling extremely anxious and untalented. I don't know what to do.
Everyone seems to have at least one special talent or “calling.” I’ve never been able to find mine. I’ve tried many different things (drawing, writing, sports, baking, etc), but nothing ever stood out to me. I eventually found musical theatre which has been my creative outlet for years. I’ve been taking singing lessons for almost two years, but I don’t think I’m getting any better. I’ve been in seven musicals, but I don’t think my dancing skills have improved. I have auditions for Hairspray coming up; I’ve been planning to try out for the lead. But recently, I’ve been having second thoughts. I’ve been feeling much less than good enough for the role. I’ve been getting awful anxiety about the auditions; every time I think about them, I get this huge, aching knot in my stomach (which sucks a little bit since I’ve been thinking about them so much). I think that I need to relax and calm down a little bit, but I just can’t seem to and I’m not sure why. I'm so sorry that this probably just sounds like complaining, rambling, and it might sound pretty pathetic, but I feel lost. I don’t know what to do.
