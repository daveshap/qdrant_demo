STEW: Good morning, everybody— Well, maybe it isn't a good morning, huh? Anne, did you ever get the feeling that there was someone else in the room with you?
MRS. SCHUYLER: Have you seen this?
STEW: Yes - the worm!
MRS. SCHUYLER: I beg your pardon?
STEW: He's a worm - and I'm gonna step on him!
MRS. SCHUYLER: To engage in a brawl! A cheap, common brawl, in my own home! I wear the pants!" The pants ! Not even the trousers!"
GRAYSON: I've tried to stop the evening papers, but it's useless.
STEW: You quit trying to stop anybody—
GRAYSON: Well, at best you might deny it.
STEW: Why deny it? The more you deny, the more they print. Let them alone! The thing to do is to sit still and keep our traps shut.
GRAYSON: Traps shut!
STEW: Certainly! I'll take care of this guy Bingy myself, personally. Now what are you crying about?
ANNE: Is this true, Stewart? Did you really say it?
STEW: Yes, I said it. Sure, I said it. I didn't say it for publication, however.
MRS. SCHUYLER: And you struck him right here in our house—?
STEW: Yes, I'm sorry, I struck him right here in your house. And I'll strike anybody in anybody's house that calls me a Cinderella Man.
GRAYSON: Well, what else do you expect them to call you?
ANNE: Dexter.
STEW: That's the fourteenth crack you've made to me. I'm keeping count. When you get to twenty, I'm gonna sock you right on the nose. As a matter of fact, I ought to sock you right now.
MRS. SCHUYLER: Anne Schuyler, are you going to sit there and watch this man insult us? Haven't you any decency left?
ANNE: Why doesn't Dexter show some decency? And you might show some too, Mother. What do you expect a man to do when he's called such names? I'm glad you hit that reporter, Stewart. He deserved it.
MRS. SCHUYLER: All right, all right! It's your funeral, Anne Schuyler!
