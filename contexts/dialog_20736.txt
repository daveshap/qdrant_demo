CHASE: Hey! Where're you off to?
GEOFF: I'm going out, Dad!
CHASE: Out?
MARJORIE: He's probably going up to the Pet Sematary. Kids've been going out there on Halloween night for years.
CHASE: What do they do up there?
MARJORIE: Oh, you know... drink beer, tell ghost stories. They try and spook each other out, talking about zombies and things... It's no big deal, Chase. I did it when I was young.
