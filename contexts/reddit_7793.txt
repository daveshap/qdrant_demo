Industry collaborations during PhD -- What am getting myself into?
A former mentor of mine is now working in a biotech startup in the same city I am doing my PhD in. I did one of my rotations there and really like the cutting-edge work they are doing, and have been invited to continue working with them for part of my dissertation work. One of the founders of the startup is a professor at my institution (and a very big name in the field) and would serve as a pro forma co-advisor and/or committee member.

I am not sure if my department administration will let me do this anyway, but before I even ask I just want to do a sanity check to see if this is something I necessarily want. In particular, I'm worried about:

1. Security of funding -- if the startup does not pay me and the work I do for them will contribute to my dissertation, will my fellowship funding be safe despite restrictions on "outside work"? In particular, I'm currently on an NIH T32, have NSF GRFP on reserve, and hope to get an NIH F31 and/or F99 in the future.
2. Managing the collaboration -- I've generally been advised that it's not a good situation as a PhD student to be the "glue" of a collaboration. While my advisor has indicated interest in the topic and would be happy to advise me on the work I do with the startup in addition to what we're already working on, should I expect the typical drawbacks of "gluing" a collaboration?
3. Career prospects -- I am very firmly hoping to land a tenure-track academic position in the long run, but obviously understand that it would help to have industry relationships to fall back on. That said, will future academic hiring committees be concerned about or even look down on these kinds of industry collaborations as long as I still publish my work in academic journals?

If you've done industry collaborations during your PhD, what was your experience like?
