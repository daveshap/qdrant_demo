KAGGS: Kaggs. Home office.
ROY: Roy Dillon.
KAGGS: I know that. Knew it when I saw you out there. The best salesman here, which isn't saying much. Want to talk to you, Dillon.
KAGGS: What's up?
ROY: That was a pretty backhanded compliment. If I let people get away with things like that, I wouldn't be a good salesman.
KAGGS: You're right. I apologize. But I still want to talk to you.
ROY: Lead on.
