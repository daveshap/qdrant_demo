Does anyone else shut down when being yelled at?
(M24) Whenever my mom is in a bad mood or pissed at someone or something. I feel like as if I have to walk on eggshells around her. If I take too long to do something or do it wrong she yells at me. Don’t get me wrong I love my mother to pieces but when she’s yelling at me my mind kind of shuts off, I can’t even think of a response and even if I do it never comes out right. I start stuttering and my anxiety shoots to 100. 

Then I get the usual thoughts of being useless, a failure etc. The rest of the day I feel like absolute garbage and I accomplish nothing other than laying in my bed. 

Does this happen to anyone else? Have you found a way to deal with it and not feel like trash?
