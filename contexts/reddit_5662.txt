Unemployed for 10 months, what should I do?
My degree was in a worthless social science and I have few hard skills. However my school is well-regarded, my gpa is excellent, and I have had multiple internships (including one at a FAANG).

Since graduating last May I’ve tried many approaches to the job hunt. I’ve tried the “spray and pray” method. I’ve tried more targeted approaches including referrals. I’ve tried gaming the ATS systems. I’ve tried reaching out to fellow alumni and other weak ties in my network. I’ve gone to job counselors. All and all I’ve applied to about 150-200 jobs, 5 of these resulted in onsite interviews, and I’ve had 0 offers. Is there anything else I can do? Any other approaches that might prove fruitful? 

I feel like I’m out of options and am beginning to burnout; I’ve tried to do everything right and be very conscientious throughout the process, but nothing I do seems to make any difference.
