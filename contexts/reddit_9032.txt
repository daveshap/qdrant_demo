How have Donald Trump's recent statements affected his campaign?
Donald Trump has made many controversial statements (see: [1](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/31/us/politics/donald-trump-khizr-khan-wife-ghazala.html), [2](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2016/08/02/donald-trump-paul-ryan-john-mccain-republican-primary/87970700/)) over the past week that have dominated the news cycle and seem to have left his campaign in turmoil. ([3](http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/02/politics/donald-trump-campaign-election-2016/))

My questions are these:  
1. Is his recent polling decline ([4](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html)) due to his controversial statements?  
2. If so, what makes these statements different than other ([5](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2015/dec/21/2015-lie-year-donald-trump-campaign-misstatements/)) controversial statements he has made in the past?
