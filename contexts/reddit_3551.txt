Taboo to give out number
I was at Best buy and saw this guy with a hamburger backpack. I asked him if it was from Steven Universe, he responded "Yeah!! Glad you made the connection". I introduced myself and we started chatting. We had a lot of the same cartoon and anime interest. I was a lil shy so we ended conversation and he went back to work. My friend pushed the ideal of me giving my number to him. So, before he walked out the door I told him, Its rare when I find someone who likes Steven Universe and Gravity Falls. I gave him a card that I wrote my number on. I told him if he wanted to chat more that would be awesome. He smiled and said sure. 

If I like someone, I'll talk to them. My other friend thought it was crazy that I approached him and talk to him. I told her, I'm not going to sit and wait for some guy to talk to me... I'll die old and alone...fuck streotypes and that gender role crap..  If you like someone talk to them. Why is it so dam taboo for women to approach men and talk to them???
