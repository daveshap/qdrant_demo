Wife Frustrated At The Current Job Market
Thanks for reading...

My wife is in her 50's and has been a stay home mom for a long period and wants to get back into the job market.  

She is from a different country (we live in America) yet has two business degrees from her country.  She specializes in accounting.  

She has applied for different jobs here and the employers either don't call her back or if she follows up, they tell her that they haven't gotten to her application.

I try to encourage her yet she is getting discouraged. 

Any ideas or suggestions?  I'm open to them.

I don't want to get a second job since I'm the only one working yet we want to better ourselves.
