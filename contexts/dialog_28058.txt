LUCY: Michael, are you still in bed?
MICHAEL: No. I'm up.
LUCY: Michael, will you do me a favor this evening? Will you stay home with Sam tonight? I'm meeting Max for dinner after work.
MICHAEL: I watch him all day. The only time I have more myself is at night. Let Grandpa watch him.
LUCY: Grandpa has plans of his own. Michael, I want you to do this. Everybody has been bending over backwards for you. You come home late. You sleep in to the middle of the day -- Sam is always alone. You do exactly what you want... tonight do what I want for a change.
LUCY: Okay?
MICHAEL: Okay.
