DOC: All it takes is a long arm.
BEYNON: Hard to judge how these things happen. The Parole Board almost never reverses their decisions.
DOC: I guess it was because I was a model prisoner.
BEYNON: This is the only time you and I meet in public. Any business with me, handle it with him...
BEYNON: You're back with your own people now. Got you some professionals.
DOC: I get my own help.
BEYNON: You run the job, but I run the show. You got two weeks to set it up.
DOC: What about them?
BEYNON: They're mine. The one with the moustache is my brother. They stay out of it. We stay clean.
BEYNON: Rudy Butler, Frank Jackson...
DOC: I heard about you. You work with Miller.
RUDY: You're out of touch. Cops blew him up.
DOC: Where?
RUDY: Chicago.
DOC: You were with him?
RUDY: Yeah. I got out.
DOC: What about you?
