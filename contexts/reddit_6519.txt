What trades job (plumber, electrician, mechanic, crane operator etc) has little exposure to dust/smoke.
My brother has asthma and is considering getting a trade but it seems many of them have much exposure to smoke/dust/ etc. and he has asthma and is not very tolerant of such things in the long term.  What would be a good trade for him with minimal smoke/dust exposure but also good income?
