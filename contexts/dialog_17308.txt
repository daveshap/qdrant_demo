NEO: So is this the same oracle that made the, uh, prophecy?
MORPHEUS: Yes. She's very old. She's been with us since the beginning.
NEO: The beginning?
MORPHEUS: Of the Resistance.
NEO: And she knows what? Everything?
MORPHEUS: She would say she knows enough.
NEO: How does she know?
MORPHEUS: She is a true psychic. She sees beyond the relativity of time. For her there is no past, present or future. There is only what is.
NEO: And she's never wrong.
MORPHEUS: Don't think of it in terms of right and wrong. She is a guide, Neo. She can help you find the path.
NEO: She helped you?
MORPHEUS: Yes.
NEO: What did she tell you?
MORPHEUS: That I would find the One.
