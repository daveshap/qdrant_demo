Was Senate Rule 19 properly invoked by McConnell against Warren to prevent her from criticizing Sessions' character?
Yesterday evening during Senate debate over the confirmation of Jeff Sessions to US Attorney General, Mitch McConnell [invoked Rule 19](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/02/08/the-silencing-of-elizabeth-warren-and-an-old-senate-rule-prompted-by-a-fistfight/?utm_term=.4bd79a74f598) to prevent Elizabeth Warren from reading a [letter](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/02/08/514085145/read-coretta-scott-kings-letter-that-got-sen-elizabeth-warren-silenced) written by Coretta King which accused Sessions of abusing the power of his office while AG of Alabama to intimidate elderly black voters.

The relevant piece of the text of [Rule 19](http://www.rules.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?p=RuleXIX) reads:

>No Senator in debate shall, directly or indirectly, by any form of words impute to another Senator or to other Senators any conduct or motive unworthy or unbecoming a Senator.

The (very brief) [history](https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/censure_cases/090Tillman_Laurin.htm) of Rule 19 is essentially this: during a debate on a bill one Senator accused another of taking a particular position on that bill due to "improper influences." The accused Senator, after being informed of what was said, rushed into the Senate chambers, had a short, heated argument, then began having a fistfight with the Senator who made the accusation. After the incident, the Senate created Rule 19.

It's not super clear what "conduct or motive unworthy or unbecoming a Senator" means, but I think saying a Senator once abused his office as a state Attorney General to carry out a program of racist voter suppression probably qualifies. So, McConnell's argument is pretty straightforward; that accusation falls within the bounds of Rule 19, Warren made that accusation, so she violated Rule 19.

Is that a proper application of Rule 19, or was McConnell's move unjustified?
