I had a threesome and I regret it
I don’t know what I was thinking. I feel anxious now and I didn’t realize how much I liked one of them. I also struggle with self esteem issues and I feel like maybe I’m not as pretty as her or like able or whatever. I don’t know how to process it and I don’t feel like I can say anything because it’s supposed to be casual. Would it be wrong to ghost someone after something like that?
