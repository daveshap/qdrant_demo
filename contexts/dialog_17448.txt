PARRISH: What, honey?
ALLISON: I lay awake nights in a cold sweat, I want this party to be like some- thing Mom would have made for you, I want it to be perfect --
PARRISH: I know you do, darling.
ALLISON: And you could care less --
PARRISH: Oh, you couldn't be more wrong, sweetheart. I can' tell you how much I appreciate it and how I'm looking forward to it.
ALLISON: Good. Songs. What songs should Sidney -- Pancho and his six men we can forget about -- what songs do you think he should play?
