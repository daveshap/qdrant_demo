DOUG: Let's walk over the bridge, we haven't done that for a while.
KATKA: We should go to the Metro it's quicker.
DOUG: Nonsense, we can pick up the tram on the other side, it won't take any longer. Come on!
DOUG: Kat, I'm in paradise. I don't ever want to leave.
KATKA: So, we won't be going to London?
DOUG: No, not just yet.
DOUG: I hope you're going to invite me in?
KATKA: Everybody is at home, it's no good.
DOUG: Let's have a look anyway.
