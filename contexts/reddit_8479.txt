Are there grounds to question the "lawfulness" of a theatrical production wherein a "Trump-like" leader is assassinated on stage?
I refer to this article: [NYC Play Appears to Depict Assassination of Trump](http://insider.foxnews.com/2017/06/11/donald-trump-julius-caesar-stabbed-death-women-minorities-shakespeare-central-park)      

I am involved in the theatre community in NYC and this play has been a big point of contention over the past couple of months. People have called to express their disgust and outrage at the disrespect it shows to a sitting President. I'm sure we can debate that as its own topic, but I'm curious as to the lawfulness of the situation. And Donald Trump Jr.'s [retweet of the story](https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/873916847191724033) brings up for me, an interesting point.     

Even with the context of the play and the play's ultimate message (the story has much more to do with the assassins' and conspirators' downfall from their folly than it does with the passing moment of Caesar's brutal murder onstage) I'm curious about at what point does the artful expression become a political statement, and are protections afforded for that?    

EDIT: Removed an unsupported assertion.
