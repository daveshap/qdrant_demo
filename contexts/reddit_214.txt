Help I’m becoming an incel
I am 16 in junior year and it’s happening, I realize I am becoming a simp and an incel. I have come a long way though. In the last 3 years I have gone from a tiny twig to a big muscular powerlifter. I did this because I was bullied and found an outlet. But my self loathing and anxiety has all but shrunk. I have gotten nowhere romantically despite being attractive and pretty jacked. I have no confidence in myself and every time I’m not in the gym and I’m in class I feel like myself from 3 years ago, tiny and scrawny. I notice that I am starting to have simp and incel tendencies badly and my friends notice too. Everyone in my friend group is no longer a virgin. I have done literally nothing. I have discovered the “red pill” idea of being alpha but doesn’t get me anywhere, I just have what they call “red pill rage” I don’t know what parts of my behavior to change to get people to take interest in me. I want to get to know girls and see where that takes me but I cannot have conversations with them because I’m scared. Anyone who has gone through this and made it out, how did you do it?
