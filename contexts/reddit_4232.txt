anyone else having a hard time moving on right now?
whether it be a breakup, ghosting or unrequited feelings â€” whatever your circumstance, anyone having a tough time moving on due to the current state of things?

not being able to go out, social distancing, it's all putting a huge weight on mental health and dating. and sometimes, facetime dates just aren't the wave.

so i was thinking of making this a positive type of thread. where we can all share some kind words to one another to let us know we're not alone in our struggles. moving on is tough, and the state of things atm can make it tougher.

just know you're not alone. time heals all wounds. <3

**UPDATE: I just wanna say that i'm really glad everyone has found this post as a way to share what's been going on during this time and remind one another that we're not alone. I myself have had a tough time getting over someone, but there's light at the end of the tunnel. we just have to let ourselves feel. i'm so happy this thread's become a safe space for ya'll. <3**
