Can we stop assuming and telling people that they're "not attractive" when giving advice here?
A typical exchange I'm very tired of seeing here is when a person (and most times, it tends to be a guy, but I'm sure it happens to women, too) who is asking a question about a dating experience. Maybe they got ghosted and are trying to figure out what happened. Maybe the other person has been sending mixed signals about wanting to meet. Maybe the person on the other side of the screen is putting in hardly effort into the conversation. Whatever the case, inevitable someone (and in ALL cases, it is a guy) chimes in and says, "It's because you must not be attractive."

This "advice"is never based off of any evidence such as pictures of the OP that would suggest that much,. Even if the OP describes themselves perfectly accurate and honestly, and really is decent looking, there are still these commenters who insist that every dating failure is due to a lack of being physically attractive.

People come here for helpful advice and not a reason to feel even worse about dating. We should not be looking for opportunities to tear them down. It's not difficult to not be a dick. While there are definitely people who may be setting expectations too high out there, I'd like to give everyone the benefit of the doubt and assume that if they can get a match and a conversation going, they weren't hideous.

If any mods are reading this, I'd like to see toxic and unhelpful comments such as this resulting in temporary/permanent bans of commenters.
