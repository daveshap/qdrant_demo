L.C.: My brother is going to kill us. He's gonna kill you and then he's gonna kill me. He's gonna kill us.
SPICOLI: Just be glad you're all right.
L.C.: My brother is gonna shit.
SPICOLI: Make up your mind. Is he gonna shit, or is he gonna kill us?
L.C.: First he's gonna shit. And then he's gonna kill us.
SPICOLI: Will you just relax, mon? He's not gonna kill us. My father is a television repairman. He's got all kinds of tools. I can fix-this car.
L.C.: You can't fix this car, Spicoli.
