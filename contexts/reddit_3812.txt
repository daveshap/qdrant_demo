Ladies, do you find Asian men attractive?
I'm an Asian man in my 30s and happily married, my wife is Chinese-Vietnamese growing up in the US. She has been with me for 10 years and prior to me she has never ever dated or even attracted to Asian men, despite being friends with many of them. She had always been in relationship with Caucasians. 

As for me, I spent my high school, college and working life in the US, and I was never able to start a relationship with anyone. Nobody ever found me attractive except my wife. But that was 10-20 years ago, and I'm curious whether things have changed these days. 

So ladies, if you don't mind me asking - do you ever find any Asian men attractive, either in real life or as a celebrity? If you do, what's the quality of the man that turned you on the most?
