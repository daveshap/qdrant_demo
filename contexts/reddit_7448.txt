MPH Canadian Graduate Programs
Hi, does anyone with any experience in applying or doing a graduate program related to public/global health (MPH) in specifically Canada give me any insight into the process. What schools did you look at, what career opportunities did it open for you once completed? I will be graduating from UofT, but I don't think I stand a good chance of getting into their masters programs since my GPA over the last two years is just a B+. Since I'm aware this is not a competitive GPA, is it recommended to look abroad or even the U.S, which I assume means I need to take the GRE? I haven't been able to find much advice on the processes at Canadian schools, so I would appreciate any insight!
