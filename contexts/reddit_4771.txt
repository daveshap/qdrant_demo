I got sick of online mental health chat services so I made a better site called MellowTalk. It helps people work out problems by incentivising good listeners
Hello! My name is Benjamin, I'm a highschooler from Virginia. A little while back I had some serious problems with depression and many times I used the chat service Blahtherapy as a release by helping people on the weekends. However, in the past couple months the chat quality has dropped severely and I find the site is often overrun with bots or trolls. It really seems like they are putting all their effort into the online therapist portion of their site and leaving the far more popular chat aspect as an afterthought.

After a couple weeks of this I decided I could do better myself so I made the site [MellowTalk](https://mellowtalk.com) to replace the platform. My site is also for the purpose of mental health and is free with no ads, forever. It pairs listeners and talkers in one-on-one conversations with the talkers being given the ability to give the listeners points if they feel like they are doing a good job, making them ascend up a leaderboard. All names are silly and randomly generated and refresh at the beginning of every chat making things totally anonymous and safe. Inbound and outbound connections are also heavily encrypted so I promise there is complete and total privacy. I designed the site based on what I wanted and I only hope that other people might want it too. I didn't have anyone to talk to and I don't want anyone else to have that experience.

It's a very small site right now. Very, very small. And totally community funded, so not exactly profitable. That said, if it seems interesting please check it out because I think it has some good vibes going. I'd love some feedback and for questions or concerns, leave a comment or send me a PM and I'll definitely get back to you. Thanks for listening, take care.

I hope this can be posted here, I want to be clear that my goal is not solicitation.
