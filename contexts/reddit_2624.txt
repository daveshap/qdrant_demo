Ever apply for a job just to see if you get an interview?
I have a job now, been here for 4 months, but I like to explore my options.  The people I work with currently are nice, however, I recently found out I have to work on the holidays.  I have two interviews lined up to learn more about the positions I applied for and the company itself.  Do you guys think there is anything wrong with that?
