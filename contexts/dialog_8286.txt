MADOX: Had a letter from my wife. The wisteria is still out, which I'm looking forward to. She says Dorset is gripped with Invasion Fever. Wrong coast I should have thought, still…
ALMÁSY: Right.
MADOX: Bermann thinks he'll be interned, poor fellow. I'm going to do what I can, but… And D'Ag turns out to be a great admirer of Mussolini. So now you can say I told you so.
ALMÁSY: I told you so.
MADOX: We didn't care about countries. Did we? Brits, Arabs, Hungarians, Germans. None of that mattered, did it? It was something finer than that.
ALMÁSY: Yes. It was. Thanks for the compass. I'll look after it for you.
MADOX: When's Clifton picking you up?
ALMÁSY: Tomorrow afternoon. Don't worry. I'll be ready.
MADOX: I'll leave the plane in the hangar at Kufra Oasis. So if you need it…hard to know how long one's talking about. We might all be back in a month or two.
MADOX: I have to teach myself not to read too much into everything. Comes of too long having to read so much into hardly anything at all.
ALMÁSY: Goodbye, my friend. They shake hands.
MADOX: May God make safety your companion.
ALMÁSY: There is no God. But I hope someone looks after you.
