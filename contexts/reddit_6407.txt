Need advice dealing with unreasonable subordinate
There is a supervisor, subordinate to me, who has been at my current job slightly longer than I have (8 years vs 7). I've been promoted to be his superior as his schedule has been limited, he had some earlier health issues which cost him to miss a lot of work, etc.

Recently he got sick again. With no vacation time left and no sick time left either, I put in, with my boss' in-writing blessing' 40 hours but told him I would have to take some vacation time initially to cover my ass. 

We had a meeting discussing his future and decided on a modified schedule until he gets back on his feet. I told him about what I was going to do as my hands are tied and it isn't my money...He seemed fine with it as he left.

He later threw it back in my face via email that I am exacerbating the situation, making life stressful and hellish for him and now he says he'll go on disability and doesn't know if/when he'll be back.

From a quick phone conversation with my boss regarding this, I also found out he'd been making comments about me to my superiors. Nothing egregious, but enough that they had to take notice and were monitoring the situation. Of course this whole situation skews them towards my side, thankfully.

Given that, I'm basically done with him and will be happy when he's gone. But he's the type of person who will stick around out of spite.

So I guess my question is this: How do I make this problem employee leave while still covering my own ass?

tldr: Help an employee, get shit on by same employee. Best way to subtly push him out the door?
