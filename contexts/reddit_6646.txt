Contacted by the same recruiter for another position.
In the beginning of May I had an interview for an Analyst position. I did the initial phone interview and an assessment that had few problems to solve using a spread sheet. After submitting my work I received an email that I was not fit for the position, judging from the work I submitted. A week after I get another email from the same recruiter for a Junior level Analyst position... I’m not going to answer her. I’m done with this crap.
