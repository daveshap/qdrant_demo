Can waves transport temperature? or How to stop atoms from creating heat I'm working on a story in which a artificial crystal can turn elements into other elements using waves of protons,neutron and electrons in a pattern, but my question is: can cold be transported by the waves? can infra red light do anything? or is there a wave that can calm atoms / lazer that can calm down atoms(make them stop so that the dont create heat)? or is it scientifically impossible
