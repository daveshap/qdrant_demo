How are you meant to kill the first shielded unit? I've gotten to I think the third overall battle (excepting a dungeon), and I plowed through 8 of the enemies who stood no real challenge, and now am getting bodied by the singular remaining unit to takes maybe 1 damage per attack and can kill any of my units after only two rounds of battle.How am I supposed to get past this?
