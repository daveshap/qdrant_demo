Goodness of fit test What is the intuition behind pooling frequencies that are less than five in a Chi-squared goodness of fit test?Even though I have been told that it is not used in industries today, the concept is still taught at the undergraduate level. And is incorporated in every question and practical of goodness of fit test that we solve.
