VITO: I know this.
PINO: I love you.
VITO: I'm listening.
PINO: Good. I want you to listen.
VITO: Jesus Christ on the cross, I said I'm listening.
PINO: Good. Vito, you trust that Mook too much. So does Pop.
VITO: Mookie's OK.
PINO: You listening to me?
VITO: Stop busting my balls. I said I'm listening ten fucking times already.
PINO: Mookie is not to be trusted. No Moulan Yan can be trusted. The first time you turn your back, boom, a knife right here. In the back.
VITO: How do you know this?
PINO: I know.
VITO: You really think so?
PINO: I know so. He, them, they're not to be trusted.
VITO: So what do you want me to do?
PINO: Be on guard. Mookie has Pop conned already, so we have to look out for him.
VITO: I like Mookie a lot.
PINO: And that's exactly what I'm talkin' 'bout.
SAL: Vito! Pino! Let's go.
PINO: Be right there, Pop. Listen to what I said.
