My resignation
I’m a 23 year old male who was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and anxiety a couple of years ago., and recently I was diagnosed with panic disorder. I’ve been on medication for quite some time now and I’ve been able to manage things up until late. I’ve been working for this big company for about 4 months now and had nothing but good experiences throughout.

Last week I experienced my first panic attack. It was a ride. These attacks went on for days. And once I was able to see my doctor we found out that I had panic disorder, and that my depression and anxiety were contributing to the development of this new disorder. We discussed what I’ve been experiencing and she advised me to resign from work. I decided not to do that and try to work on and power through it, but it only made things worse. 

Fast forward to today, I decided to resign from my company because my conditions were getting in the way of me being able to do the work that was expected of me, and it’s been taking a physical toll on my body as well. I had to explain to my superiors why I decided to resign, and I did my best to explain to them. To my surprise they didn’t ridicule or judge me. They gave me encouraging messages. They gave me support and understanding.

Being a young man with depression we all know that comes with it’s fair share of stigma. I was blessed enough to be employed by a company who’s superiors are understanding.

Right now I’m on the road to recovery. Hopefully it all goes well.
