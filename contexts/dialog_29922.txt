GRACE: Where you coming from?
JOHN: All over. Chicago, Miami, Detroit. Just lately Albuquerque.
GRACE: You've been around.
JOHN: I guess I've got wander in my blood.
GRACE: Where you headed?
JOHN: I don't know. I have to make a stop in Vegas. Business to finish. Then maybe I'll head to Santa Barbara. I might be able to pick up some work there.
GRACE: You just travel around, no direction, no steady work. You must like taking chances.
JOHN: If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
GRACE: What happens if you lose?
JOHN: I pack up and go somewhere else.
GRACE: Somewhere else. I've never been anywhere else. Just once. Years ago. Went to the state fair. It was nice, but it wasn't nothing.
JOHN: I couldn't stay in this place. I wouldn't. I'd just pick up, do whatever I had to do, and get out.
