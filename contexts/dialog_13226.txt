GATES: Hudson Hawkins gets the chair of honor. How about a Gates-arita? I used real hot dogs.
HAWK: Weren't you the bartender at Jonestown?
CESAR: Good job, not pretty, but good.
HAWK: Ah, the mafia, the cops; do I know how to party or what?
GATES: All this trouble for a horsey. I may not know art, but I know what I like.
HAWK: You certainly do.
GATES: So when's that Sebastian-Cabot- Buckingham-Palace-looking- Butlerhead getting here?
