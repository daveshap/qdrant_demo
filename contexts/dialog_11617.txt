MYRA: ) If you could have seen your face when I told you good night! You looked so, so... Ah!
ROY: Oh, come here.
LILLY: Roy! What are you doing in San Diego?
ROY: Myra and me come down to LaJolla for the weekend.
LILLY: If you come out to the track, don't know me.
ROY: We won't hit the track. The beach. Couple a nice restaurants.
LILLY: What's that?
ROY: Four grand. For the hospital. Is that enough?
LILLY: Roy, I don't want money from you.
ROY: I pay my debts.
LILLY: You do?
ROY: Expecting visitors?
LILLY: No. That was the point.
ROY: You ought to put a bandage on that.
LILLY: No can do. Have to dip in and out of my bag too much. Besides, it'll heal in the air.
