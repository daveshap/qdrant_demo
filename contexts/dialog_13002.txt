ZOZO: What do we do with all these people?
PAUL: Open up the ballroom, we'll put them there. And Zozo tell the kitchen to make rice and beans - a lot of it.
TATIANA: You could leave, Paul.
PAUL: What are you saying, Tatsi?
TATIANA: Your card says Hutu. Take our children, go and get the twins, pay money at the roadblocks. Get them out. Please.
PAUL: Enough of this. We stay together. Let me rest, I will feel better then.
LIEUTENANT: You are the manager?
PAUL: Yes, sir. What is wrong?
LIEUTENANT: Everyone must leave the hotel now.
PAUL: Why sir?
LIEUTENANT: It's an order. Get everyone out now.
PAUL: I...ah...need some time. Please give us twenty, thirty minutes. People are sleeping.
