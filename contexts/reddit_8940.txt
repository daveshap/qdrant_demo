What is the neutral approach to addressing sexual assault allegations made against both Bill Clinton and Donald Trump?
Something I want to get out of the way right off the bat: There is no neutral approach to the act of sexual assault - It is an egregious crime and accusations of such should be taken seriously.

That being said - the past 48 hours have featured as many as ten women, through various news outlets ([Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/donald-trump-new-york-times-allegations-229705), [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/13/us/politics/donald-trump-women.html?_r=0)), accusing Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump as a sexual assailant, in various forms.

Per usual, even these allegations have seen reactions along party lines (unfortunately), and while many jump to the defense of Trump due to various reasons, many more have simply convicted him in the court of public opinion.

Here's my question: These allegations, both in the case of Donald Trump and in former president and known-philanderer Bill Clinton, consist of multiple variables that would make them somewhat difficult to prosecute - specifically time. Many of these women are 40, 50, 60+ years old and are speaking on incidents that allegedly happened years ago.

Is there a statute of limitations on these crimes? What sort of evidence would be necessary to actually label one of these men a sexual predator? Would Donald Trump have a libel case against any of these accusers should they lack a preponderance of evidence?

Most importantly - who has the burden of proof in these scenarios? Is it on the accused to prove innocence in the face of countless accusations that no doubt have a timely element? Or do we place the burden on the accuser - who likely has been through a mental struggle in their path to facing these crimes?
