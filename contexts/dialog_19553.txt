NANCY: Much better.
GLEN: I heard your ma went ape at the security store today. You look like the Prisoner of Zenda or something. How long's it been since you slept?
NANCY: Coming up on the seventh day. It's okay, I checked Guiness. The record's eleven, and I'll beat that if I have to. Listen, I... I know who he is.
GLEN: Who?
NANCY: The killer.
GLEN: You do?
NANCY: Yeah, and if he gets me, I'm pretty sure you're next.
GLEN: Me!? Why would anyone want to kill me?!
NANCY: Don't ask -- just give me some help nailing this guy when I bring him out.
GLEN: Bring him out of what?
NANCY: My dream.
GLEN: How you plan to do that?
NANCY: Just like I did the hat. Have a hold of the sucker when you wake me up.
GLEN: Me? Wait a minute, you can't bring someone out of a dream!
NANCY: If I can't, then you all can relax, because it'll just be a simple case of me being nuts.
GLEN: I can save you the trouble. You're nutty as a fruitcake. I love you anyway.
NANCY: Good, then you won't mind cold-cocking this guy when I bring him out.
GLEN: What!?
NANCY: You heard me. I grab him in the dream -- you see me struggling so you wake me up. We both come out, you cold cock the fucker, and we got him. Clever, huh?
GLEN: You crazy? Hit him with what?
NANCY: You're a jock. You must have a baseball bat or something. Come to my window at midnight. And meanwhile...
GLEN: Meanwhile...?
NANCY: Meanwhile whatever you do don't fall asleep. Midnight.
