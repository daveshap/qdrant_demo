Suicide hotlines are completely useless
I’m going through a rough time and called a suicide hotline. It was a totally pointless conversation. They just wanted to direct me to other resources that I already knew existed. I want to talk to someone, not be told to go to the emergency room or to get a psychiatrist. It’s like the people on the line assume you’ve never dealt with mental health issues or depression and completely lack common sense. I don’t need to go to a hospital or be committed, I just need someone to listen to me.
