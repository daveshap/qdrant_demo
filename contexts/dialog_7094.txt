SONRISA: So, how do you get the woman to come to me?
MAX: I told her it's just business to you, that all you want is a reasonable solution to this. You give her daughter back, she agrees to leave the country. I play the guarantor, drive her down to Mexico tonight, and put her on a train to Brazil or wherever.
SONRISA: And she bought that?
MAX: I have sincere eyes.
SONRISA: Make the call.
MAX: She's gonna need to know that her little girl's alright.
SONRISA: She's got my word.
MAX: She's gonna want to hear for herself.
MAX: Look, we gotta keep the momentum up here, not give her a chance to think. If she hears her kid's voice...
LAUREN: Hello...
MAX: Hang on, Lauren. We're conferencing in Sophy.
