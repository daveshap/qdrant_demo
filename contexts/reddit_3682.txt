I used to think that r/dating was for solid advice, but it's just a haven of horror stories, insecurities and pitty mongering.
Whether  people are aware or not, but this subreddit is depressing as fuck. Low self esteem cringeworthy stories and people who think  love  will fulfill empty voids.

Some of you want fwb or casual  and then complain and feel bad when a relationship is not the option. Or look for fun and then be disappointed when nothing turns out how it is.

The bottom line is simple. Some of you need to learn how to love yourselves first. A lot of you are insecure, unable to know what you want, but you're  quick to find someone  else because you're  lonely.

9/10 this leads to finding the wrong people to where you'll be back there again on here now asking  if the person in your life is good for you when they're  obviously  doing shitty stuff.
 
With all that said, yes there are exceprions to the rule here. People who take advice, people who wish to make a change and want better. 

Realize one thing  ladies and gents  you need to make a better you for someone else and they need to make themselves a better them for you. 

No matter how many dating apps you use and or delete or person you meet in person if your life is fubar you'll  never live to your optimum level.

Good luckâœŒ
