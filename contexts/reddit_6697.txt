Can I look for temporary work while currently signed to a contract?
So a little over a month ago, I was contacted by a recruiting agency that said they were looking for someone that was in my field for a new job. I went and did the interviews and got the job. I'm currently still a college student and this was basically like an internship with the possibility of becoming a full time job. I was very excited because I never had a job in my field before. But as of last week because of the pandemic people were furloughed and since I was on a contract for the recruiting agency I am basically just not working any hours and not getting paid because my contract was hourly. The recruiters told me that as soon as we could they would love to have me come back to the position immediately, but I don't know how long that is going to be. Basically my question is am I allowed to apply and potentially get hired for another remote position while I am still signed by the recruiting agency? I would very much like to get back to work as I am incredibly bored and my semester is just about done. I am looking for work in IT/Cybersecurity.
