Should I apply for a job that wants someone available immediately, even if I'm not able to start for two weeks?
Currently working a job I would need to give two weeks notice from. I found one advertised that seems perfect for me, in my field, entry-level position, and relatively close to home (in fact about half the distance to my current job). The only catch is the advertisement for this job says the candidate must be immediately available, which I know I'm unable to do unless I just walk out of my current job. I'm just looking for advice, should I even bother with applying?
