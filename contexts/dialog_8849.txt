KARRAS: Chris MacNeil?
CHRIS: Please go away.
KARRAS: I'm Father Karras.
CHRIS: Oh, I'm very sorry Father. Hi.
KARRAS: That's okay. I should've told you I wouldn't be in uniform.
CHRIS: Yeah, it would've helped. Have you gotta cigarette Father?
CHRIS: So, how'd a shrink ever get to be a priest?
KARRAS: It's the other way around. The society sent me through med school.
CHRIS: Where?
KARRAS: Harvard, Bellevue, John Hopkins.
CHRIS: You're a friend of Father Dyer, right?
KARRAS: Yes am.
CHRIS: Pretty close?
KARRAS: Pretty close.
CHRIS: Did he tell you about my party?
KARRAS: Sure did.
CHRIS: About my daughter?
KARRAS: No I didn't know you had one.
CHRIS: He didn't mention?
KARRAS: No.
CHRIS: Didn't tell you of what she did?
KARRAS: He didn't mention her.
CHRIS: Priests keep pretty tight mouthed then?
KARRAS: That depends.
CHRIS: On what?
KARRAS: The priest.
CHRIS: I mean, what if a person, let's say, was a criminal, like maybe a murderer or something, you know? If he came to you for help, would you have to turn him in?
KARRAS: If he came to me for spritual help, I'd say no.
CHRIS: You wouldn't.
KARRAS: No I wouldn't. But I'd try to persuade him to turn himself in.
CHRIS: And how do you go about getting an exorcism?
KARRAS: I beg your pardon?
CHRIS: If a person was possessed by a demon of some kind, how do you go about getting an exorcism?
KARRAS: Well, the first thing I'd do is put them into a time macine and send them back to the sixteenth century.
CHRIS: I didn't get you?
KARRAS: Well it just doesn't happen anymore Mrs. MacNeil.
CHRIS: Oh yeah, since when?
KARRAS: Since we learned about mental illness, paranoia, schizophrenia. All the things they taught me in Harvard. Mrs. MacNeil since the day I joined the Jesuits, I've never met one priest who has performed an exorcism, not one.
CHRIS: Yeah well, it just so happens that somebody very close to me is probably possessed, and needs an exorcist.
