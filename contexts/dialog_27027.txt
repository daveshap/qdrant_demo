THEO: She needs help.
MARROW: I'll take her with me to the University tomorrow. I can't believe I read the test wrong. I didn't see anything that looked like she was suicidal.
LUKE: You used the wrong test.
THEO: Will the two of you shut up! God damn it! Maybe the tests were right, Marrow. She's sensitive, she's vulnerable, but I don't think she's suicidal and I didn't have to test her. Maybe she wasn't trying to kill herself. Maybe she was really scared. Maybe she really heard voices.
LUKE: You're not telling us something.
MARROW: Watts. Those were his keys Nell found. His roommate called and said Watts left when he was supposed to. I think he's here.
THEO: He's wandering around the house, and Nell heard him. She thought it was ghosts. Let's go look for him again.
MARROW: No. If he's lost somewhere in the house... he'll have to stay lost until tomorrow, until the night is over. What we have to do now is be together, with Nell.
