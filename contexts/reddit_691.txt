Increase in pimples?
Just like my mother, I’ve only had about two pimples at most at the same time. However I currently have nearly 10, I’ve never had this happen before. I haven’t had any diet changes, although my diet isn’t necessarily the best, I’m confused as to why I suddenly have so many? I’ve been stressed recently, but I have been for the past few years. Does anyone have any idea why it might have suddenly increased? Any advice for getting rid of pimples is also appreciated, thank you
