ANGELA: Is your niece older than 12?
LAZARUS: Oh, she older than that.
ANGELA: My sister got a bad cough with her pneumonia. I just copied her prescription. You don't need to pay anything... just take it. But if she gets worse, you give me a call. I wrote my number on the box.
LAZARUS: This gonna get you in trouble?
ANGELA: Not if no one finds out.
LAZARUS: Thank you. Oh. My wife. She had a card here for her migraine pills. She ain't gonna be around no more... So if you...
ANGELA: I already tossed that out. Somethin' you should'a done to that woman long ago... how she treated you. Of course, that's none of my business.
LAZARUS: Don't make it less true.
