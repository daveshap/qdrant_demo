Career Change
I've been alifestyle journalist for over 10 years, I managed English-language magazines, websites etc. That is untill I relocated from Thailand to the UK six month ago. I haven't been able to find employment since. 

At first I aimed for marketing and communications jobs, but after months of rejections, I'm very much in doubt over what to do next. I actually ended up riding a bicycle for uber eats just to get out of the house and earn a little money. An while no work is shameful, I still feel sort of embarrassed working as a delivery guy, considering my previous jobs and experience. 

My question would be, has anyone here undergone a  career change? Can you share your stories? I'm 38 and the idea of starting at the very bottom again is not appealing at all... Looking for inspiration and a morale boost.
