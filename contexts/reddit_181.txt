My dad is the reason for my depression.....
My dad and I got into a really big fight a couple years ago which lead me to move out of his and his girlfriends house. My life went down hill after that. A month or so after that I got suspended for drinking vodka in school. When my grandma asked me: " Did you do it cause you felt unloved"? That really hit me. I wondered the real reason and i got my answer; I wanted to numb it. Thats when i started drinking when my mom and stepdad would leave. Things are slowly hurting less but i still cry almost everyday and now I'm not as social as i used to be. I also think i might have anxiety and i dealing with my sexuality. can someone please give me advice?
