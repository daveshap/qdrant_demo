How to get global application menu on Ubuntu 18.04 Is it possible to have global application main menu in Ubuntu 18.04 (similar to what was available in Unity, with application menu appearing in the top bar)?There are a lot of conflicting information on this subject on the internet, with mostly suggestions to install some Gnome extensions that are no longer available or not maintained. Besides, most (if not all) of the answers are for Ubuntu 17.10. So I am wondering if there's a way to have it for Ubuntu 18.04?
