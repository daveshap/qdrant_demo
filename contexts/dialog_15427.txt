CALLER: How'd you know I wouldn't be in the same room with her?
PETER: You told me. When you called you said she was in the other room. Drop the knife.
PETER: Computers. That's how you got into Homesearchers records. You can get into anything. But why? Why?
DAVID: You still haven't figured it out, have you? You think that I've put you through an ordeal. My scars run so much deeper than yours.
PETER: What scars?
DAVID: The scars on your chest. From where I stabbed you with my fountain pen.
