Training programs for job-specific skills?
Hello. I am recently coming out of some health problems that left me with only retail experience at a fresh 26 years old. Things are starting to look up for me but I'm kind of stuck job-wise so I was wondering if there were programs for individuals like myself that get you trained in a position and into the workforce. 

I know school would be a good solution but I just can't afford it, right now. I feel lucky to have the part-time work I do given the current situation.
