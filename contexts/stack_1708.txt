3 Phase calculations I have 3-phase utility mains power supply whose phase voltage is 220 V, 50 Hz.I keep getting confused about various calculations of the 3-phase mains as follows:Formula for the line voltage.Formula for the Average and RMS outputs of 3-phase full bridge rectifier.If I use this output of the bridge rectifier as my DC Link voltage to feed a 3-phase full H-bridge and drive it with 3-phase sinusoidal PWM then what will be Average and RMS voltages of the resulting 3-phase sinusoids?
