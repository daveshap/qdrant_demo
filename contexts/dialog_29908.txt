JACOBY: Laura, you didn't come and see me today.
LAURA: I couldn't it was Johnny Horne's birthday. I promised I'd be with him. I told you not to call me here.
JACOBY: A little trouble with your parents is the least of your worries and something I am certainly willing to put up with.
LAURA: I'm not.
JACOBY: Did you make me a tape?
LAURA: I already made you two tapes.
JACOBY: Laura, you have to deal with all of this.
LAURA: I'm dealing with it, Doc. Big time. Maybe I'll make you a tape tomorrow. Goodnight.
JACOBY: Send me a kiss.
