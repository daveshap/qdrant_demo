Just a friendly reminder...
Ghosting is not okay. 

If you've made concrete plans to go on a date (whether it's a 1st or 10th), and you're suddenly getting second thoughts...

Then put on your adult pants and TELL the other party. Ghosting is one of the most immature "outs" you have.

This is coming from someone who was really looking forward to another date. We texted back and forth until the day prior to the date. And then they vanished. I'll probably never know the reason, but for a solid few hours, I felt crushed, wondering what I did wrong, or if I just wasn't good enough.

And it's not worth making someone go through those mental gymnastics. Rip the proverbial band-aid off, be honest, and at least give the other person a REASON. 

Thanks for coming to my TED talk.
