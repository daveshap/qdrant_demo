Potential employer wants college transcripts. My college GPA kinda sucked. What do I do?
Hi, all. I applied for a job and listed that I had a 3.2/4.0 GPA. It's not a lie, but it is my GPA calculated from only my major courses. My cumulative GPA is somewhere around a 2.8 due to my 1st few semesters being a bit rowdy. Now an employer is asking for my transcripts. What should I do?   


My guess is that I should send the transcripts with a detailed explanation of what exactly they're looking at and/or why certain grades were so low. Should I even bother? Any and all advice is accepted. thanks in advance!
