Are \"the probability of something being seen\" and \"the probability of someone seeing something\" the same? I'm puzzling over how to treat the distribution of TV advertising spots.I have a list of spots and the % of the population who saw them.What I'm trying to get is a Gamma distribution representing the viewing audience and their probability of seeing random spots. Obviously some people watch more TV than others and therefore have a higher chance of seeing a random spot.I can fit a Gamma distribution to the spots, but I have a nagging feeling that the distribution of spots is not the same as the distribution of viewing probabilities, i.e., the distribution of the probability that a spot was seen is different to the distribution of the probability of someone seeing a spot.Can someone help me untangle my thoughts on this? Thanks.
