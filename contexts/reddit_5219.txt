Employee who is horrible at work
So all I have an employee who just started work very recently and she came to me a week after starting, and let me know that the schedule that I provided for her will not work. I explained to her that “you are currently in training and I want to make sure you are comfortable with the basics before I start making big changes to the schedule for you.” She replies, “well my boyfriend is the only one with a car and he works a different schedule so YOU NEED to change my schedule.” I explained to her the same thing about training and she gets upset and leave. Next day she came to work on her scheduled time and I just asked her the simple question “how is your day going?” She replies with a “you are my boss, I have my boyfriend to talk to” A few days later she shows up to work late by 25 minutes and I gave her the freedom to make up her 25 minutes  the same day or another day and she says “well I can’t do it because of my ride”. I forgot to even mention she is only a part time employee who works 17 hours a week. I’m currently weighing my options because now it looks like I made the wrong decision to hire her. Is there any good solutions you all may have for this situation?
