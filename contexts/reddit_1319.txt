I temporarily deactivated my Instagram, and it was one of the best things I’ve done for my anxiety/depression (:
I made a similar post regarding why social media can be toxic, etc....

But I finally decided to choose my mental health over some bullshit “Game of Likes” which is Instagram. Gonna take a niiice, long break (might be one month, might be six, who knows...). 

I’m proud of my decision and would highly recommend the same to anyone who has been on the fence. Trust, not having to subconsciously compare yourself daily to “perfect images” of “perfect people” will do wonders if you already struggle with anxiety or have self-image/confidence struggles.

That is all. 🖤

*side note: this song is a whole ass mood for me today since I did away with insta, maybe some of you can appreciate it too 🎧 “Flume - never be like you (Takaryu Redo)” * (:
