She also was found to have a urinary tract infection at that time and this was treated with ciprofloxacin. Her creatinine both at XYZ Hospital and University of A was elevated at 2.4. I do not have the results from the prior years. A repeat creatinine on 08/16/06 was 2.3. The patient reports that she had gastric bypass surgery in 1975 and since then has had chronic diarrhea and recurrent admissions to the hospital with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and dehydration.
