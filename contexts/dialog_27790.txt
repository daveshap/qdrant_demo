BOBBY: Well -- Professor Barnhardt, I guess. He's the greatest scientist in the world.
KLAATU: He lives here in Washington, doesn't he?
BOBBY: Sure. Right near where my mother works.
KLAATU: Where is that?
BOBBY: Department of Commerce. She's a secretary. They have a man they call the Secretary, but he isn't at all. My mother's a real secretary. Mr. Carpenter -- now can we go see the space ship?
BOBBY: Boy, I'll bet he's strong. I bet he could knock down a whole building.
KLAATU: I shouldn't be at all surprised.
BOBBY: Gee, I'd like to get inside and see how it works. What do you think makes it go?
KLAATU: Well -- atomic power, I would imagine.
BOBBY: I thought that was only for bombs.
KLAATU: No. It's for a lot of other things, too.
BOBBY: You think it can go faster than an F- 36?
KLAATU: Yes -- I think so.
