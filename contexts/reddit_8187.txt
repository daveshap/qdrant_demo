Reports suggest that police use of lethal force against minorities in the U.S. is higher than their white counterpart; and so is the rate of lethal force when compared to police forces in other countries. What policies, both federal and local, have been pursued to try and reduce this number?
T[his article by the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/28/opinion/minneapolis-police-brutality.html) goes deep into the issue of how the use of lethal force by the police in the U.S. still persists, particularly against minorities.

While the conclusion is still being examined, [there is evidence that suggests that rates of use of lethal force by the police in the U.S. are much higher than the rest of the world](https://theconversation.com/why-do-american-cops-kill-so-many-compared-to-european-cops-49696) and [the number of incidents where the ](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/09/the-counted-police-killings-us-vs-other-countries)[police force was involved is significantly larger in America](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/09/the-counted-police-killings-us-vs-other-countries) than in the rest of the world

One possible change that was discussed was [when Obama called for changes in policing in 2015](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/03/us/politics/obama-calls-for-changes-in-policing-after-task-force-report.html).

However, the rate of police lethal force against minorities is still very prevalent as quoted in [this study](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/34/16793.short) "for young men of color, police use of force is among the leading causes of death" and the persistent prevalence of use of lethal force by the police against minorities is claimed to be [racially motivated](https://www.law.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Paper-Obasogie.pdf). In contrast, [according to this study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6080222/) that examined police lethal force from 2009 to 2012, a large quantity of deaths by lethal force has occurred and at least 50% of the victims were white.

What other policies, local and federal, have been pursued? How successful have they been?

 What policy reasons have been given as to why lethal force from police is so prevalent in the U.S. compared to other countries?
