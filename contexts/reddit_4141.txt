Seems impossible to meet someone after college
I just can not understand how you meet someone after coming from university. Work is not an option because I can go an entire day and not see a woman my age. Then I go to a busy gym where it would seem really weird to even talk to someone. Lastly I head home to my apartment where I never see anyone.

Pretty much every friend I have is dating someone now too. So if I go out I feel like an extra wheel.

All my previous relationships have just been through partying in college so I am lost. I wouldn’t say I’m really introverted but I am very... laid back. Do people really just go up and talk to strangers at places like grocery stores or whatever? Just seems so odd to me.

Any advice or even telling the story of how you met your so would help.
