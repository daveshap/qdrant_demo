Is going to a more expensive physical therapy school with better facilities worth the extra cost?
I’ve been accepted to two pt schools and I’m not sure where to accept. School 1 definitely made a stronger impression on me when I visited for my interview day. School 2 was rather underwhelming when I went to visit but I’ve heard many good things about the program. School 1 had significantly newer and nicer facilities but costs about $20,000 (6700 per year) more. Any advice on making my decision? Are the better facilities worth that much more when job placement out of pt school is already as good as it is? Thanks for any help.
