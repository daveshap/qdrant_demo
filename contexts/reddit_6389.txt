[Advice] "Your 140 Character Pitch"
So I've been applying for a lot of social media marketing positions and I often run into this question. It's a lot more difficult than I ever expect it to be. This place has my resume, usually has my cover letter AND they want a 140 character summary of...what? Who I am? Why I fit?

How would you condense your application into a tweet? What areas should I try to target when I type this up?

Thanks in advance!
