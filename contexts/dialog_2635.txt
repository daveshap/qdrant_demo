DELACROIX: I have this concept for a TV pilot. There's no guarantee it will get made but regardless, you'll still make some money.
CHEEBA: How much?
DELACROIX: First things first. I have to know if Manray is up for this.
MANRAY: What do I have to do?
DELACROIX: Some tap dancing, some singing.
MANRAY: Where do I sign?
CHEEBA: What kind of show is this gonna be?
DELACROIX: Different.
MANRAY: How different?
DELACROIX: Trust me. Of course I still have to pitch it to my boss, but we'll have an answer one way or the other.
MANRAY: DeLa, I'm aboard. As long as I get to hoof and get paid too!!!
DELACROIX: That's right. Money turns the wheel.
CHEEBA: What about in the mean time? Not the in between time?
DELACROIX: You'll both get an advance and you can stay with me.
