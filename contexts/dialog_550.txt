WADE: Some party, huh? Sorry I lost sight of you. I had to step outside for a smoke. You find anybody you know here? There must be some kids you used to know from school. You want to go tomorrow? See your old teachers? Be more fun than hanging out with me all day.
JILL: No.
WADE: No what?
JILL: No I didn't see anybody I know. No I don't want to go to school here tomorrow. I want to go home.
WADE: You are home. There are lots of kids you still know here.
JILL: I don't want to be here. Don't worry, I love you, Daddy, I do. But I want to go home.
WADE: Jesus. Listen, Jill, tell you what. Tomorrow morning, you still want to go home, I'll drive you down. I'll get off work or something.
JILL: I called Mommy.
WADE: What? You called Mommy? Just now?
JILL: Yes.
WADE: Jesus, why?
JILL: I... because I want to go home. She said she'd come and get me.
WADE: Come and get you! Shit! It's a damn half hour drive each way. Why didn't you talk to me about it first?
JILL: See, I knew you'd be mad.
WADE: Yeah. Yeah, right, I'm mad. What'd you tell her, for Christ sake?
JILL: I told her I wanted to come home. Daddy, don't be mad at me.
WADE: Well, I guess I am. I planned this, I planned all this, you know. I mean, it's sort of pathetic, but I planned it. You shouldn't have called your mother. C'mon, we're gonna call her before she leaves.
WADE: She's gone already! Gone already! Couldn't wait.
JILL: Yes.
WADE: That's all you got to say? Yes"."
JILL: Yes.
WADE: She won't be here for a half hour. Think you can stand it that long?
JILL: Yes.
WADE: Where do you expect to wait for her? Obviously downstairs with the other kids isn't good enough.
WADE: Sit right there by yourself if you want. Wait for her by yourself. That's fine with me. Just dandy. I'm going downstairs.
JILL: That's fine with me too. When Mommy comes, tell her I'm up here.
WADE: I thought I told you to move that truck!
JACK: Relax, Chief. We're leaving. You wanna toke?
WADE: You gotta be more careful about that shit. Gordon or one of those guys sees you smoking that wacky tabacky around me they'll expect me to bust you. And I'll be outta a job.
JACK: Some job. Here, have a hit. Don't be such a hardass. I know you got problems, but everybody's got problems.
WADE: Not here.
