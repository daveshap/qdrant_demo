JIM: Plato?
PLATO: I'm here.
JIM: Boy, I'm blind as a bat! You got a match? I'm going to break my neck in here. Where are you?
PLATO: I've got a gun.
JIM: I know. Light a match, will you?
JIM: That's swell. How are you?
PLATO: I'm fine.
PLATO: You think the end of the world will come at nighttime, Jim?
JIM: No. At dawn.
PLATO: Why?
JIM: I just have a feeling. Where are you?
PLATO: Here.
JIM: Well, stop hiding and stand up. I can't talk to you if I don't see you.
