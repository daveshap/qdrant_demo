What's the definition of \"Dynamic Regression Models\"? I am trying to learn about Dynamic Regression models. However, the sources on the topic is (relatively) few compared to other TS topics, and so I cannot really get a grasp of where to start. I really want to get a specific definition of what a dynamic regression model is. What for example is the difference between an ARIMA model with external regressors and a dynamic regression models?Is it simply a AR distributed lag model with ARMA errors?
