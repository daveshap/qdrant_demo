CONRAD: Who are you?
M.J.: Inspector Halloran. Homicide. You were supposed to contact a Peter Kurten?
CONRAD: I was? How you spell that?
M.J.: Cut the crap. You got a sheet the length of my arm...
CONRAD: I never hurt nobody...
M.J.: Shut up -- I'm talking. You got felony breaking and entering, burglary, felonious...
CONRAD: I never carried a gun!
M.J.: You don't listen very good. This break in -- I can call it a felony -- three strikes, and you got about sixteen strikes already, and you're in jail for the rest of your life, no parole. Or I could see it gets forgotten.
CONRAD: You get me out first.
M.J.: Doesn't work that way. You had your chance, now fuck yourself...
CONRAD: Tell me what you want me to say. Anything.
M.J.: You were going to make a delivery to Peter Kurten for Daryll Lee Cullum. I want Kurten's phone number.
CONRAD: I don't have it...
CONRAD: Wait... wait... I already called him, I threw it away.
M.J.: You already made the delivery?
CONRAD: No, that's still in my jacket I was wearing. We were supposed to meet on the docks, that number 47 wharf, 10 o'clock Friday. He's gonna hand me 500 bucks.
M.J.: What Friday?
CONRAD: What day is this? In jail you lose track. This week. Friday.
