A quick note on being late on your car payment
Real simple. Just call the loan office. 

I posted a few days back asking questions about technicalities and if I was in danger of repo and truthfully the advice I got from the post was harsh (more to-the-point than anything) but tits-on accurate. I was in danger of repo and they were looking for me.

However, I ended up having to pay less than I thought I would (less than half) along with a 30 breathing period that will pick up with regular payments. And I was 97 days past due. More than I thought.

Now I can actually close my eyes at night instead having my heart race and me jumping to the window to see if I have to beg for my car not to get towed.

Weight=lifted. Thanks reddit.
