JACKIE: Nicolet and Dargus stop me at the airport and mark the bills.
ORDELL: Man, I don't like that part.
JACKIE: It washes off. I tell them we're doing it the same way as before. They'll follow Sheronda. I hate the idea of leaving her for a fall.
ORDELL: She won't have no problems 'cause she don't know nothin'.
JACKIE: Are you sure she don't know about the money?
ORDELL: She don't know shit about the money.
JACKIE: What does she think she's gettin?
ORDELL: I told her this is a game us rich folks play, exchanging gifts. Like a scavenger hunt. She didn't know what that was neither. No answer?
LOUIS: Uh-huh.
ORDELL: Hang it up, she's on her way. You gotta listen to this. This involves you.
ORDELL: No, you gonna give her a Robinson's/May bag this time?
JACKIE: Right, the one Simone gives me. Simone and I'll make the switch at Robinson's/May. She knows what I look like?
ORDELL: She saw you with Sheronda. So Simone goes to the dress department with her Robinson's/May bag.
JACKIE: Designer clothes.
ORDELL: She waits for you to go in the place where you try things on.
JACKIE: The fitting room. There's a sign over the door.
