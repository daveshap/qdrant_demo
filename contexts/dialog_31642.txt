GIBBONS: Congratulations, you've just graduated at the head of your class.
XANDER: You're a cold piece of work. You almost got three people killed out there.
GIBBONS: Good thing you were there to save the day. Come walk with me.
GIBBONS: You've really got me confused, Cage. On the one hand you showed leadership, courage under fire, a willingness to protect men you hardly knew... and on the other you have an arrest record that pegs you as near sociopathic. Help me out here. I'm not following your evolution.
XANDER: You want the cheap backstory? The runaway mom, the suicide dad and the foster homes? Gimme a break. You're not interested in my past, you're interested in my future as some kind of spy.
GIBBONS: You're perceptive too. I forgot to add that to the list of surprises. I'm with the National Security Agency. And unlikely as it may sound, I need your help.
XANDER: I'm not interested. I've already got a job.
GIBBONS: You're an adrenaline junkie with one foot in the penitentiary. You risk your ass building a daredevil myth that means nothing and you're not getting any younger.
XANDER: I plan on getting a lot older. And playing spy games sounds like a quick way to get yourself dead.
GIBBONS: That's too bad. I thought a guy like you would appreciate the challenge.
