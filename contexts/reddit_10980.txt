Was drunk last night and wrote notes to my friends and family, woke up to find this one and cried.
Dear Me,
I know how hurt you are, I know how sad you are. But one day, one damn day, you’re gonna look back and think, wow, times sucked back then, but I got through them. I’m happy with my family of four and I’m happy with my beautiful wife. The Godfather of my children is my best friend and they always ask to see him and we always do. We wake up every Sunday morning to eat pancakes and head to Church. I work at a job that helps take care of my children and wife, plus I make enough to hand over some money to my mom and dad. I’m happy with my life and don’t wish any bad upon myself or wish to die anymore.

At least, I wish that’s how my life could’ve been.
