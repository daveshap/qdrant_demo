What part-time jobs can house and feed a single adult?
For various health reasons it's looking like working 40 hours a week is going to be unrealistic for me.

By some miracle I was able to earn an associate degree in computer science, but I haven't been able to advance much beyond that.

I've been trying to slowly study the rest of my way towards a job in programming, but it looks like freelancing (my best shot at part-time programming work) is extremely difficult to get into if you don't have prior experience.

What other options are out there?
