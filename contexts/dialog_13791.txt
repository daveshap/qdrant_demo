LOWELL: Mrs. Wigand, how do you do?
WIGAND: Jump in, quick, c'mon...
LOWELL: I'm Lowell Bergman. We spoke on the phone, remember?
LOWELL: C'mere. I want to talk to you.
WIGAND: Good. I want to talk to you.
WIGAND: What do...
LOWELL: I did not burn you. I did not give you up to anyone!
WIGAND: This is my house... In front of my wife, my kids?! What business do we have?
LOWELL: To straighten something out with you. Right here. Right now.
WIGAND: So, you didn't mention my name? You haven't talked to anybody about me?
LOWELL: Why am I gonna mention your name?
WIGAND: How did Brown & Williamson know I spoke to you...?
LOWELL: How the hell do I know about Brown & Williamson?
WIGAND: It happened after I talked to you. I do not like coincidences!
LOWELL: And I don't like paranoid accusations! I'm a journalist. Think. Use your head. How do I operate as a journalist by screwing the people who could provide me with information before they provided me with it?
WIGAND: You came all the way down here to tell me that?
LOWELL: No. I did not. Big Tobacco is a big story. And you got something important to say. I can tell. But, yes. I did. I came all the way down here to tell you: story, no story, fuck your story, I don't burn people.
