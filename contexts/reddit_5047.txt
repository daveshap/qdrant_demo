Why Am I Not Getting Interviews or Offers?
I’ve been trying to leave my current retail job for a few months now and the whole virus thing has made things worse. I’ve been applying like crazy to places and I’m not getting interviews or responses back. I’ve been working in retail for 2 years. I have experience has a COS (check-out supervisor), cashier, stocker and I work trucks at my current job. I have an Associate’s degree and am currently going for my bachelor. My availability is 100% open and I’m more than willing to work all weekends/holidays. What am I doing wrong?

I do have a gap in my resume for about a year. I broke my foot at work and was essentially fired for it. I was unable to find work for the 6 months after and I didn’t include that job on my resume because I left in a horrible way. Could this be it?
