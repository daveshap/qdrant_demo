Are Agra main attractions closed on 31st of December? I'm planing a trip to India for the end of this year, and I want to know if Agra main attractions are closed on the 31st of December (like the Taj Mahal and Agra fort). I didn't find anything in the internet with respect to this. I only see that the Taj is closed on all Fridays.
