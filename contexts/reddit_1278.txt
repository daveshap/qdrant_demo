I cooked a whole meal just for myself today and I know it's not much, but I'm kinda proud.
I like cooking and baking especially, but usually I don't bother just for myself. Recently I've been having quite a bit of alone time at home, which honestly usually fires up my anxiety. Atm however, it is still necessary for me to be at home a lot, since I just got discharged from a psychiatric ward a week ago and don't feel ready to start working again quite yet. However, I made it my goal to do progressive muscle relaxation every other day, get out of the house for a walk or something similar once a day and try to eat properly. And I have actually done that in the last couple days :) Anyway, I just wanted to share with someone who understands and thought of you folk. Thanks for reading, pics of the food in the comments if anyone's interested :)
