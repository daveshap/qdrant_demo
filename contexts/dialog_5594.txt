REGGIE: What are you doing here?
PETER: I phoned but nobody answered. I wanted to tell you how sorry I am -- and to find out if there was anything I could do.
REGGIE: How did you find out?
PETER: It's in all the afternoon papers. I'm very sorry.
REGGIE: Thank you.
PETER: I rang the bell but I don't think it's working.
REGGIE: Yes it is -- I heard it this morning.
