SUSIE: Hey, pal. I don't know about you, but where I come from there's a little girl's room and a little boy's room and the little boys don't go where the little girls go.
FRANK: All right, but make it quick. Shoes! What size do you wear?
SUSIE: Nine.
FRANK: Nine?
SUSIE: Nine!
FRANK: Big feet.
FRANK: See anything?
JACK: How about these?
FRANK: Jack, for crying out loud. Your bachelorhood's showing. Ah, here we go.
