ThERE's tHiSSS GuYYY WHooo...
So in my class, there's this guy, I never tried getting close with ever since he entered school last year. We're the same batch. We  always sit close to each other but the thing is, we never tried getting to know one another and become literal friends. Until, this year started, he suddenly asks me with assignments, flood messages me, always ask things from me, and when I talk to this friend of mine in front of me about stories he enters the conversation all of a sudden, then I, SOMETIMES, CAUGHT HIM LOOKING AT ME!!!!!!! Also, when I'm in a certain place in the classroom, he goes there too! And when he laughs, he looks at me! Pleassseeeee helppp, I don't know what's going on! You think? \[By the way, add the fact, that there's an issue that might make him think that I like HIM!\]
