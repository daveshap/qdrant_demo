DON JAIME: The way she looked at me, Ramona! She hates me now. I think I've made a great mistake. She's going away, she's going away and nothing will stop her.
RAMONA: Speak to her again. Explain everything to her seriously.
DON JAIME: What for? She'll only look at me that way again ... I couldn't. You go. Perhaps she'll listen to you. Try to convince her.
RAMONA: But what can I say to her, sir?
DON JAIME: Tell her I lied, that I didn't take advantage of her.
