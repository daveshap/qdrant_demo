Is there a standard checksum for verifying multipart key fragments? We will have a symmetric key arriving in three component parts.  Once all parts arrive, the key custodians will get together for a ceremony where each enters their part of the key into a secured system.  This system will XOR the parts together to combine them into a final key that will be injected into the receiving system.  The secret-combining system verifies that each custodian has correctly entered his or her part of the key by having each custodian enter a checksum for their key part; these checksums were generated at the time when the key was split.  To avoid entering a corrupt key, if there are any errors in the data entry the process must be terminated and restarted.  My question is if there are standard checksum algorithms used for validating key entry into a multipart key exchange system?  Or is this something each crypto vendor typically comes up with on their own?
