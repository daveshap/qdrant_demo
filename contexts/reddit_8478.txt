Did the Clinton campaign receive incriminating information about Trump from the Ukrainian government, as Glenn Greenwald claims?
Greenwald claims that: "there’s an amazing Politico article from January of this year that describes how allies of the Clinton campaign, including somebody being paid by the DNC, met with officials of the Ukrainian government, which was desperate to help Hillary Clinton win and Donald Trump lose, and get information incriminating about Trump from Ukrainian officials. In other words, Ukraine was meddling in our election by giving Democrats incriminating information about Trump".

Anybody have a link to the Politico article in question? Is it credible? Does Greenwald represent it accurately?
