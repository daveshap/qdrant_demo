WELLES: So, she didn't leave a note? She never gave any indication where she might go, before she left?
MRS MATHEWS: No.
WELLES: She just seemed... depressed... ?
MRS MATHEWS: She didn't seem herself. For months there never was any way to get her to talk about it. One night we went to bed... the next morning she was gone. She took some clothes.
WELLES: What was she running from?
MRS MATHEWS: I don't know.
WELLES: If there's anything you feel uncomfortable talking about, tell me, but I have to ask. Your husband... he committed suicide?
MRS MATHEWS: Yes.
WELLES: September 4th, 1993. About a year after Mary disappeared.
MRS MATHEWS: We were divorced by then. Things fell apart... he was living with a friend...
WELLES: Why do you think he did it?
MRS MATHEWS: It got to be too much for him.
WELLES: You have to forgive me, but in these circumstances... with your daughter... Were there any indications of... any sort of abuse?
MRS MATHEWS: There wasn't anything like that. The police and the FBI people asked, but there wasn't anything happened like that, never. My husband... his heart broke when Mary left...
WELLES: I didn't mean to...
MRS MATHEWS: You try going through what we did. Bob couldn't take it, that's all. Christ, there's times when it still seems like I can't either.
WELLES: I had to ask. I apologize.
MRS MATHEWS: No one knows what it's like. You can't even imagine how much it hurts.
MRS MATHEWS: People remember me from the news. Can you drive me back now?
WELLES: Of course.
