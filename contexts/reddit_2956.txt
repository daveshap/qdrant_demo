How do I go about telling new employer that I need time every two weeks for therapy?
So without getting into too many details, I go to therapy every other week for a variety of mental health issues. It is extremely beneficial for me and I don't think it is something I could cut out of my life/budget.

I am starting a new job in two weeks. My current employer and I have a great relationship so I have been open with my boss about it and time wise it works out well because I don't go into work until 10 am (therapy at 830). This new job is 9-5 but like my current job has a lot of night time events and overtime where consistently scheduling therapy in the evening is very difficult.

Would it be out of place for me to ask for the same 10-6 traditional work schedule before i even begin? 9-5 in my field is rare to begin with because of all the evening and night time events (I work in college student affairs). Most official hours are either 10-6 or 11-7.

EDIT: Thank you so much for your responses everyone! I start in two weeks I will see what happens. Based off of conversations I have had with them the hours seem to be negotiable week to week but push comes to shove this job has a lot of PTO I could just use it to come in a half hour late twice a month like someone mentioned.
