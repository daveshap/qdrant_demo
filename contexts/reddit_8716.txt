Are public libraries needed in a world where everyone has internet access, and if no, should libraries serve a different purpose and if so what?
98% of the Swedish population has internet access at home ([see page 9](https://www.iis.se/docs/Svenskarna_och_internet_2018.pdf)). And 94% of the Swedish population actually uses the internet ([see page 10](https://www.iis.se/docs/Svenskarna_och_internet_2018.pdf))

The purpose of libraries is mainly to give the public free access to information, and has been so since the beginning of the history of public libraries (see history section on [wiki page](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_library?wprov=sfti1))

So in a modern society where 98% have access to the Internet at home, havenâ€™t public libraries lost their purpose? Should they serve a different purpose? What?
