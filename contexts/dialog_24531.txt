MOZARELLA: Good evening, sir.
MULLIGAN: I come to the old lady's funeral.
MOZARELLA: I don't believe I've seen you at any of our services before.
MULLIGAN: That's because I've been on the wagon.
MOZARELLA: PLEASE!
MULLIGAN: Where are they holding the wake? I'm supposed to be one of the pallbearers.
MOZARELLA: Show the gentleman to the chapel - pew number three.
