PRIEST: So... everything sounds... wonderful?
JEANNE: Yes, it is.
PRIEST: Then... why are you here so often?
JEANNE: I feel safe here. And it's where I can talk to him.
PRIEST: Him?
JEANNE: Well, I try and talk to him, but mostly he's the one who does the talking.
PRIEST: Who is this he"?"
JEANNE: He never says his name.
PRIEST: What... does he... look like?
JEANNE: Beautiful.
PRIEST: And what does he say to you?
JEANNE: He says... he says I must be good... and help everyone... and take care of myself. Do you think he's coming from the sky?
PRIEST: Perhaps... but wherever he comes from, I think you should listen to him, because it sounds like he's giving you very good advice.
