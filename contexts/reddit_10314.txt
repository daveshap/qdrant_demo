I'm afraid one day I'll just snap and kill myself
To be honest every time I'm angry or sad my mind goes to suicide. Even the smallest things: an argument, missing the bus, anything. And I'm just scared one day I'll get so mad or sad I'll kill myself. It's been like this for a year or two, but it keeps getting worse. I'm just so scared. I feel bad because other people have it worse then I do, but I'm just whining and afraid. A friend told me "other people's worse problems don't mean you're problems aren't bad" but I'm just so scared
