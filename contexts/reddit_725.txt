How in the H E C K do you get your hair to grow out long.
I, a trans mtf, want to grow out my hair but am cursed with the worst genetics and I cant grow it out very long. I want to know what to use on my hair to help with keeping it healthy whilst it grows  and if there are any vitamins or supplements that could help with it.
