MARTY: Mr. Haller said he'd check him out, and guess what? No one sees him again!
UNCLE AL: And what do you suggest I do about it, dear boy?
MARTY: I want you to turn this into a silver bullet.
UNCLE AL: You're not going to let it go, are you?
MARTY: I saw what I saw.
UNCLE AL: Marty, the moon wasn't even full!
MARTY: Jane... you don't have to do that.
JANE: Don't tell me what I have to do and what I don't, booger-brains.
MARTY: Will you marry me, Jane?
UNCLE AL: Would you kids mind telling me how this guy Lowe became a werewolf to begin with?
JANE: I don't know. Maybe he doesn't know, either.
MARTY: No one knows how cancer begins, either- or exactly what it is- but people still believe in it.
UNCLE AL: The kid is eleven years old and already he sounds like a Jesuit. A French Jesuit.
MARTY: I think he's going to come for me. Not just because I know who he is, but because I hurt him. Only I don't think he'll try again as Lowe.
UNCLE AL: Dear boy, you have gone right out of your mind.
MARTY: Will you do it?
MARTY: Please, Uncle Al.
JANE: Will you?
