Parents
Is it normal to be nearly completly disconnected from my parents?
It's like we have 0 common interests, I disagree with most of their views, and I feel as if I can't tell then anything serious. It's as if I rent a room from 2 people who live in the same house, and I barely see them, they rarely talk to me. And I'm just completly disconnected from them.

Any advice?❤🙂
