MARTHA: Like keeping her home from school?
MOTHER MIRIAM: Yes.
MARTHA: Listening to angels?
MOTHER MIRIAM: She drank too much. That's what killed her.
MARTHA: Do you know what she did to her?
MOTHER MIRIAM: I don't think I care to know.
MARTHA: She molested her!
MOTHER MIRIAM: Oh, dear God.
MARTHA: There is more here than meets the eye isn't there? Lots of dirty little secrets.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Oh God, if only I'd known.
MARTHA: Why didn't you? You knew she was keeping her home from school. You knew she was an alcoholic.
MOTHER MIRIAM: I knew that after the fact.
MARTHA: Why didn't you do anything to stop her?
MOTHER MIRIAM: Because I didn't know...
MARTHA: Oh, God.
MARTHA: Larry...
LARRY: Marty, what are you doing here?
MARTHA: Larry there's got to be something missing.
LARRY: I gave you the pictures Marty, what else do you want?
MARTHA: Something they... that they overlooked.
LARRY: What? You think that the girl is innocent?
MARTHA: I don't know.
LARRY: You got to be crazy.
MARTHA: Larry...
LARRY: What's the matter with you, you've seen the reports. It's a cut and dried case.
MARTHA: Maybe there's something that's not in the report that should be.
LARRY: You're too involved Marty. Jesus look at you. Why don't you turn this case over to someone else?
MARTHA: Thanks.
LARRY: If I find anything I'll call you.
