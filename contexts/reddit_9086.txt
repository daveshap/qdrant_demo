Why did youths vote for remain on Brexit referendum when their unemployment rate is so high?
[This FT article includes the graph that shows the turnout rate of youth populations](http://blogs.ft.com/ftdata/2016/06/24/brexit-demographic-divide-eu-referendum-results/). ~~Overwhelming majority of them voted for remain.~~ EDIT: [it appears that actual numbers of youths who voted were very few](http://m.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2016/06/brexit-vote-one-chart).

[Youth unemployment rate in the UK has been worsened off](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/feb/22/youth-unemployment-jobless-figure) however. [In 2010 it marked the highest in past 17 years; 19.6%](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jun/20/young-unemployed-george-osborne-cuts). Currently it stands at [13.4%](http://www.statista.com/statistics/266228/youth-unemployment-rate-in-eu-countries/), seems much more lowered in this five years but nevertheless, double the amount of Germany (6.9%) or [Japan (5.8%)](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jun/20/young-unemployed-george-osborne-cuts), and I assume it is still in the higher bracket.

The reason I came up with this question is because of the strong correlation between unemployment, lesser education, low income and the Brexit vote (as shown in the FT article I posted above). If we assume job dissatisfaction was the core issue of Brexit vote, how come youths voted for remain instead of leave?

I acknowledge that youths are generally liberal, and they benefit a lot from free movement and ability to get educations or meet different people in different places of Europe. Nevertheless, if their job condition is not satisfactory, I still wonder why it almost didn't have any noticeable impact.

Just want to point out I'm only an undergrad interested in this issue so a lot of my presumptions may be wrong, and I'm all happy and open to acknowledge and fix my errors. Thanks in advance.

---**EDIT**---

Thanks for many responses. There one point that I want to make it clear:

* I made a debatable premise that people with difficult economic circumstances voted for Brexit. Indeed it doesn't make any sense at a glance as Brexit will hurt the national economy more. But then again, a lot of people speculate that they didn't vote rationally. Also, statistics from the FT article shows strong correlation between lower income / unemployment and Brexit support. Finally, many of their arguments such as about Â£350 million to be taken back or immigrants taking their jobs, are in my opinion, manifesting that their Brexit vote were stemming from their economic dissatisfaction *they perceived* as resulted from joining the EU.
