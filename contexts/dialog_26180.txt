BUFF: Hey!
BEE-BEE: Hey. Do you have a cigarette?
BUFF: No I quit.
BEE-BEE: Hey, you said you did a video?
BUFF: Yup.
BEE-BEE: What's it about?
BUFF: It's really not about anything.
BEE-BEE: Oh. Well, what's it on?
BUFF: A cloud.
BEE-BEE: A cloud?
BUFF: Yeah. There was this cloud and I video taped it.
BEE-BEE: Oh.
BUFF: I was doing schrooms and I saw this cloud. It looks excellent on tape. The video is like my head and, and everything, you know, is, like, is like in there that I see. You know? Plus, I'm gonna come down here one night and walk around inside the Circle A with the camera and tape shit.
BEE-BEE: Oh, that's so amazing. I wish I could see it.
BUFF: You can see it. Whenever you want. Don't you, um, work at a hospital or something?
BEE-BEE: Yeah, I'm a nurse's aide at Mercy.
BUFF: Your a nurse?
BEE-BEE: No, I, you know, I help 'em out. I empty bedpans and bring 'em lunch. That kind of thing.
BUFF: Any gunshot victims?
BEE-BEE: Oh, some of 'em. But it's mostly just strokes and shit. I mean, most of 'em just sleep all the time and get kind of yellow. Usually they die id they're, you know, really yellow.
BUFF: Sounds like a bummer.
BEE-BEE: Oh, no, it's not. I mean, they're not all totally in a coma. I mean, they know when I'm helping them.
BUFF: Mm. Hey, what are you doing now?
BEE-BEE: Right now?
BUFF: Yeah.
BEE-BEE: I don't know. Waiting, I guess. You know?
BUFF: Do you wanna go to the van?
BEE-BEE: Now?
BUFF: Yeah, we could hang out and smoke a dube, you know?
BEE-BEE: I don't smoke dubes and I don't really hang out. But I'll go back. Okay.
BUFF: Okay, whatever you want.
