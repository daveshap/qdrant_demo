How do I find out what job I would like to do?
I have been looking through many job advertisements for a new job in 30 mile radius and cannot find something that appeals to me and have lost hope in finding something I would enjoy. If you can help offer some advice or point me in the direction of where I can find help then that would be much appreciated.
