How do I make a career change when so few of my current skills are applicable to my desired career?
I want to change careers to a marginally related field, but it’s just out of reach

After doing some intense soul-searching and reflection, I realized that I want to work in environmental policy and be a policy analyst. Based on what I’ve read, it seems to fit my interests while also being extremely fulfilling. I love the idea of constantly learning new things, solving problems by using that critical thinking part of my brain, and contributing to the protection and wellbeing of the environment and vulnerable populations. 

My issue is that my current career has not provided me with any relevant skills to make this transition. I’m working as a medical laboratory technician in a clinical lab. I have my BS in Biology, which isn’t completely unrelated, but it’s way too far to have gained any relevant skills or have taken classes useful for a policy analyst job. Literally none of the skills or education that I gained while in this current job are applicable in a policy analyst career.

I’ve been volunteering with a local environmental nonprofit for the past 6 months in hopes to eventually get hired. I’m slowly gaining some of the skills there and I want to take some of the proper classes to be a better candidate. However, I feel like that could take a lot longer than I originally anticipated, and I want to make sure I’m making the best use of my time to get out of my current job and start moving toward a more fulfilling career. 

Has anyone made this huge change? How did you go about this?
