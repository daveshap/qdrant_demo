What are some simple but not obvious tools/practices/ideas that made your daily life as a grad student more productive and that you are super glad to have figured it out?
Example (This is very primitive of me) - I got to know about citation managers only after writing my first paper using Word where I manually typed in all the references! It made all the difference. 

I am about to start grad school and thought of having a heads up. These may not necessarily be academic in nature. anything that made your grad life a notch better is welcome :)
