Honest opinions on earning 14/hr fulltime?
I'm graduating college in a week and have been offered and accepted a full-time job with a nonprofit that pays 14/hr, 27k a year before taxes. This job is in a social work field so I wasn't expected a high salary, but after talking to some friends they seem to think 27 is ridiculously low and it's making me nervous. I don't live in a big city so rent is not outrageous (hour outside of Denver, CO), and I will be living with a roommate. I've never known much about finance or budgeting, so i'm having a hard time grasping how living on 14/hr will really be. Will I be able to have any spending money realistically or is all my income going to go to bills?! I'm stressing a little.
Any advice is much appreciated!

additional info: the reason I accepted the position is because it is in my field of choice and will give me great social work experience (I plan on getting my masters down the line...)
