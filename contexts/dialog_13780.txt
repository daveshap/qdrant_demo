DEBORAH: Can I go to dance tomorrow? I'm better...
LIANE: ...if you are, then I'll take Barbara to soccer and take you to dance after...
WIGAND: I can take her.
LIANE: Don't you have to be at the office?
WIGAND: Is there any more rice...?
LIANE: Yes, it's on the stove...
LIANE: Do you want more rice?
DEBORAH: Maybe later.
LIANE: How about you?
BARBARA: I'll take some.
WIGAND: Instant rice...?
BARBARA: Can I go over to Janeane's house?
LIANE: I'm sorry, darling, have you seen my coffee mug...?
WIGAND: Try the car.
LIANE: Uh, what are those boxes?
WIGAND: I'm going to the store. You need anything?
LIANE: What do you need at the store?
WIGAND: Soy sauce...
LIANE: Right now?
WIGAND: That's my stuff from the office...
LIANE: Why did you take your stuff from the office?
WIGAND: I didn't want to leave it there...
LIANE: I don't understand.
WIGAND: I got fired this morning... Where else am I gonna take it?
LIANE: Why? Who said?
WIGAND: Thomas Sandefur...
LIANE: What are we supposed to do...? What about our medical coverage; what about our health? What about our car payments? The payments on this house?
WIGAND: There's a severance agreement... It includes cash payouts over time and continuing medical coverage... Sure you don't need anything?
LIANE: No, thank you.
