Six Sigma
My company's fiscal year is about to end and I realized I had a professional development stipend that I'd never used. Six Sigma caught my attention. 

The thing is, my experience with Six Sigma is limited to it being a long running joke on 30 Rock. 

I tried to find just how valuable this certification is but my searches only returned companies that do certifications. So, people out in the real world, how valuable has that been to you? If I get certified, is that something worth putting on my resume and LinkedIn? (I know, Jack would never)
