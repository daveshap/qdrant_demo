STEVEN: ...and it's now ringing...ringing... and -- Hello? Anthony's Pizzeria? Yeah, this is officer Randy Parker over at the station.
RANDY: Oh, c'mon, would you stop, please?
STEVEN: Is this Anthony?...Yeah, well, I just have one question for you, Anthony -- did you fuck my dog?
RANDY: Oh my God, Steven.
STEVEN: Yeah, well somebody fucked her and if I find out it was you, I'm gonna come over there and shoot you in the head.
RANDY: I'm now begging you.
STEVEN: Listen, since I got you on the phone -- ask the guys there if they wanna chip in for a hooker. I'll send her right over. Her name is Vicki.
VICKI: Steven!
STEVEN: She's a waitress at Joey B's but she needs some extra cash. Ward's the pimp.
VICKI: I'm literally going to kill you!
STEVEN: Ten dollars! Hell, I can't do that to you -- you can have her for a pizza.
VICKI: A pizza?!
