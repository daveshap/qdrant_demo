JESSE: I'm not asking.
EARL: Well you're not getting, either.
JESSE: Listen -
JESSE: I don't like getting grilled by that DEA bitch, I don't like taking that kind of heat!
BOOTH: None of us like it!

BOOTH: Just take it in stride.
JESSE: I'm not gonna take -- I'm not gonna take it in stride. I had a good run turn to shit on me like that - cleaned me out.

JESSE: I was on a roll! Iâ€™m a little overextended now.
EARL: Oh Jesus Christ...
JESSE: So I want the money and I want it now.
EARL: Well you can't have it.
