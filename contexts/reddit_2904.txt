Who succeeded in doing a career they were initially not suited for? What is your story?
English teachers and history professors used to sing praises about my work. Science and math teachers ignored me. 

I was clearly somebody who was suited for liberal arts. I read a new book every morning and debated Shakespearean history in the evening.

But I decided to be something else.

I was accepted to a university as a transfer student for marine science by the skin of my teeth. Ever since I got my acceptance letter, I swim every weekend, sail every other weekend, and study my old science textbooks. I am relentless in making this work because I love what they do, whether it's outdoor research or being cooped in a lab working on a paper.

So Redditors, what's your story?

EDIT: Thanks for all the responses! You guys are absolutely inspiring, and I hope to take a page out of your books to continue to make progress on my new path :)
