DANNY: Yeah, I uh, have a buyer who's looking for about a quarter's worth.
POOH-BEAR: Crank or glass?
DANNY: The good stuff. Can you handle that?
POOH-BEAR: I'm sorry. Would you like a taste?
DANNY: No, I'm good.
POOH-BEAR: I insist. It's delicious. Just a taste.
DANNY: Not bad.
POOH-BEAR: Secret recipe.
DANNY: Can we talk price?
POOH-BEAR: Make me an offer.
DANNY: I don't know, 14,000 a kilo?
POOH-BEAR: I deal in U.S. pounds, friend. None of that faggot metric crap for me.
DANNY: Okay ... How about um .. 6,000 a ounce.
POOH-BEAR: Hey, okay.
DANNY: You're serious?
POOH-BEAR: Anything for a dear friend.
DANNY: But I just met you.
POOH-BEAR: But you're a friend of Jimmy's. I think of you as a brother already.
DANNY: So that's 40 lbs. at 6 a pound then?
POOH-BEAR: If you say so.
DANNY: Pooh-Bear, I don't mean to be rude, but I get the feeling you aren't taking me seriously.
POOH-BEAR: Maybe you're the one who isn't taking me seriously.
DANNY: Why do you say that?
POOH-BEAR: I welcome you here with open arms and you got the nerve to low-ball me like some slick used car salesman.
DANNY: Hey, I was just trying to ...
POOH-BEAR: I want to tell you about the last guy who tried to jam me up on a deal.
DANNY: Hey, I don't play that.
