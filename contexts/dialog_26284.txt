NORMA: Don't turn around. Keep your eyes on the book.
GILLIS: Yes, Norma.
NORMA: I just came to say good night. I don't want you to see me -- I'm not very attractive.
GILLIS: Good night.
NORMA: I've lost half a pound since Tuesday.
GILLIS: Good.
NORMA: I was a little worried about the line of my throat. This woman has done wonders with it.
GILLIS: Good.
NORMA: You'd better get to bed yourself.
GILLIS: I think I'll read a little.
NORMA: You went out last night, didn't you, Joe?
GILLIS: Why do you say that?
NORMA: I just happen to know it. I had a nightmare and I screamed for you. You weren't here. Where were you?
GILLIS: I went for a walk.
NORMA: No you didn't. You took the car.
GILLIS: All right, I drove to the beach. Norma, you don't want me to feel I'm locked up in this house?
NORMA: Of course not, Joe. It's just that I don't want to be left alone. Not now, while I'm under this terrible strain. My nerves are being torn apart. All I ask is for you to be a little patient and a little kind.
GILLIS: I haven't done anything, Norma.
NORMA: Of course you haven't. I wouldn't let you.
