DANTE: Do you know that article is accurate? Caitlin's really getting married!
RANDAL: You know what I just watched?
DANTE: Me pulling a can off some moron's fist.
RANDAL: Return of the Jedi.
DANTE: Didn't you hear me? Caitlin really is getting married.
RANDAL: Which did you like better: Jedi or The Empire Strikes Back.
DANTE: Empire.
RANDAL: Blasphemy.
DANTE: Empire had the better ending: Luke gets his hand cut off, and finds out Vader's his father; Han gets frozen and taken away by Boba Fett. It ends on such a down note. And that's life-a series of down endings. All Jedi had was a bunch of Muppets.
RANDAL: There was something else going on in Jedi. I never noticed it until today.
DANTE: What's that?
RANDAL: All right, Vader's boss...
DANTE: The Emperor.
RANDAL: Right, the Emperor. Now the Emperor is kind of a spiritual figure, yes?
DANTE: How do you mean?
RANDAL: Well, he's like the pope for the dark side of the Force. He's a holy man; a shaman, kind of, albeit an evil one.
DANTE: I guess.
RANDAL: Now, he's in charge of the Empire. The Imperial government is under his control. And the entire galaxy is under Imperial rule.
DANTE: Yeah.
RANDAL: Then wouldn't that logically mean that it's a theocracy? If the head of the Empire is a priest of some sort, then it stands to reason that the government is therefore one based on religion.
DANTE: It would stand to reason, yes.
RANDAL: Hence, the Empire was a fascist theocracy, and the rebel forces were therefore battling religious persecution.
DANTE: More or less.
RANDAL: The only problem is that at no point in the series did I ever hear Leia or any of the rebels declare a particular religious belief.
DANTE: I think they were Catholics.
