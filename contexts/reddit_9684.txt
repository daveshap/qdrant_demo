New graduate with BSc in Computer Science considering Student Affairs
I just finished up undergrad with a BSc in Computer Science and I'm giving some consideration to going to grad school and pursuing a career in Student Affairs.

During my time at undergrad, I worked in a variety of roles at my college including working with the Admissions department and the higher-ups in Academic Affairs helping with the summer orientation sessions and training admitted students in the use of the school's online systems.  I genuinely enjoyed these experiences and I really feel comfortable with the general "vibe" (for lack of a better term) of the higher education work environment.

Would I be a marketable candidate for these types of positions (or grad school to begin with) considering my Computer Science undergrad?  I have spoken to a handful of former instructors and advisors, and most said they feel a tech-savvy candidate could be appealing due to the general tend towards technology in just about every aspect of higher education.

I just wanted to get some additional input and this seemed like a good place to ask!  Thanks for anything you can tell me.
