20yrs old and still have issues with self harm and self esteem
I’ve self harmed for a very long time; off and on and only when I feel overwhelmingly sad or angry especially. I remember being 7 and getting scolded for biting myself and leaving large unsightly bruises on my arms.

It’s come to the point where I feel so immature and ashamed for doing it, I mean I’m an adult now and I’m not supposed to be doing that kind of behavior at work, school, etc. I just can’t stop. I have no insurance so therapy is put on hold (which I really do want to go see another therapist but the last one I had I honestly didn’t like, and I essentially ghosted on her. I’m clearly amazing at proper communication aren’t I?) I was previously diagnosed with C-PTSD, Major Depression, and Social anxiety, but I’m also wanting to pursue a possible diagnosis of ASD since I strongly suspect I’m on the spectrum. 

Last night work was terrible, and I dug my nails into the vein part of my inner elbows. It left awful looking bruise scrapes which straight up looks like I’ve been shooting up drugs. My managers had to calm me down twice that night. I’m still incredibly embarrassed that I sorta made a scene and I’m almost positive my coworkers are done with my shit.

I plan on trying to sign back up for state insurance and find a therapist who specializes in PTSD. If I don’t get approved then I’m more than likely on my own with paying for that. I also feel conflicted on therapy...Like nobody really ever *wants* to listen to me. I’ve tried pouring my heart out on Reddit posts and were only met with trolls who message insults. It makes me feel like maybe I’m just a horrible person and that people can even smell it from a Reddit post. That I don’t deserve help.

Is there anybody out there who can at least empathize with me? Or who can maybe give a lil distraction tonight?
