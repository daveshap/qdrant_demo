Now that everyone is committing left and right, please remember to not judge people based on where they're going
**You don't know** if where they decide to go is based on money, (maybe they got accepted to their dream school but couldn't afford it).
 
**You don't know** if their reach school was your safety. 

**You don't know** if they got rejected everywhere else and didn't really have a choice anymore. 

**For whatever reason, you don't know.** So please keep that in mind when hearing about where everyone is going this year. Just because it's not a "prestigious school" or T-20 (or, if it is) doesn't mean they can't still be happy/successful. 
 
I find it easiest to just tell everyone congrats :)
