How do i tell a friend about the death of my grandpa?

Recently my grandpa died and i am really struggling to cope on my own. I havenâ€™t told one of my best friends but i feel like she should know as this is a big part of my life. She is always kind and supportive but every time i try to tell her, something stops me. How to i tell her i am going through this ? The funeral is coming up soon and i have never been more scared for something in my life. I need to tell someone but i really dont know how without bringing down the mood and just saying it out of the blue. If anyone has any advice please help.
