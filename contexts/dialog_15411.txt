KATHY: Each of those grids represents almost a square mile.
FRANK: That's a big area to cover.
PETER: Then let's narrow it down.
ANDY: Homesearchers.
WOMAN: You want me to what?
ANDY: I want you to feed every street in this grid into your computer.
WOMAN: It'll take hours. You can't make me do this.
ANDY: You're right, I can't make you do it. Besides, you're probably gonna be too busy with the Franchise Tax Board anyway.
WOMAN: What are you talking about?
ANDY: I gotta friend over there. He was telling me things are kind of slow. So, I figured I'd give him a call, have him come down here and look through your records. You know, give him something to do.
WOMAN: What's the first street?
PETER: As large as castles, you are still light as the air, one hundred men can't move me. It's posed as a question. What am I?
FRANK: A building?
PETER: A building isn't as light as air. What's large, but as light as air and can't be moved?
KATHY: As large as castles.
FRANK: Yes. Why not just say a building if he meant any general type of structure?
PETER: He's not going to give us direct hints. He's going to skirt around it.
FRANK: He uses castles...plural -- then says can't move me." Singular. Not can't move us."
PETER: A shadow. What's as big a castle? As light as air , but one hundred men can't move it? The shadow of the castle. Are there any buildings that have the name Castle in it that cast a shadow long enough to fall across another building?
FRANK: Wait a minute. There's an apartment in that area called the Castle Arms.
PETER: That's got to be it.
