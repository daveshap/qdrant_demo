Recruiters/Hiring Managers - Assigning "mock strategy presentations" to gather free ideas?
Hey r/jobs,

Happy Thursday! Is it ever a practice for companies to assign "mock strategy presentations" in order to generate free ideas, but with no intentions of moving forward with candidates?

I had a third round interview with a company last Monday. I didn't hear anything back until yesterday, where I was given an assignment to provide strategic recommendations next week.

Given the time it took for a follow-up, I'm anxious that they've selected another candidate - but have decided they might as well move me to this next round in order to gather free ideas.

Looking for brutally honest insights on recruiting/hiring practices: Does this fourth round assessment indicate my chances are looking pretty good as candidate, or is it ever a practice to give these assignments to gather free ideas?

Many thanks for your responses!
