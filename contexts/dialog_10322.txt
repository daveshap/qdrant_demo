NICKY: Laurel. Tickets are all set. I double-checked.
LAUREL: Thanks, Daddy. But I just need one. Mother's not going.
NICKY: Opening night?
LAUREL: I know -- why should a bitter divorce interfere with tradition?
LAUREL: Rogan, Laurel. You also have a Rogan, Lillian. She won't need it. Sell it.
NICKY: Take it yourself. Take a date.
LAUREL: I don't have a date. I don't want a date.
NICKY: And you blame me. It's because we never talk. Let's talk.
LAUREL: I have a class. I'm late.
NICKY: Can we talk later? Will you be at the party?
LAUREL: I'm not sure.
