Therapy requires money. And to get money you need a job, but you can't get a job because you have terrible anxiety. What do people with anxiety really do? They're in a position, it seems, where there isn't a way out. This seems like a dangerous place to be
I could easily see somebody in this position getting very angry and lashing out. I work coding jobs that don't require any contact with people in the real world. i barely make enough money to get by. If this job goes to shit, which is very likely btw, I could be homeless and screwed.

OH yeah and there's the dreams that you get every night that increase anxiety and the reason why I'm posting on here is because I just woke up from one of them.

But hey, I guess I just chose to be like this. That's what people would have you believe, anyway.
