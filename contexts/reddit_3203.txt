new job lied about working from home and is now at location, any advice?
I took new job to get out of a bad work situation and happy to either work on location or from home which is common in my field esp since I dont work with a team-- I was open. 

I accepted the job, I was told several times I was going to be a wfh employee from HR and have emails to show from HR saying this and docs they had me fill out for working at home and criteria for internet etc, that they canceled scheduled orientation date since I was remote.

The background check due to an error on their end took 2mths. Since knowing once background clears I will be remote job I decide to move in with fiance who works further away and this was the perfect chance with having the time before start. I set up new home office and picked out place with extra bedroom for office.

Boss now tells me this isn't the case. I addressed this clearly what I was told and how I was moving based on this info but I am being told that was a mistake and need to be in office everyday and can't even have one day - didn't matter what HR said.

I am stuck with a far commute that I didn't sign up for. I asked recruiter in interview what the hours are, he responded 9-5 now I am told 8-5. I wouldnt mind at all if was told upfront but now that I have a longer commute with a longer work day. I've had long commutes in past and really worked hard to avoid this by asking questions. 

I am discouraged from this horrible onboarding exp. I am not sure what I should do. I feel lied to. Its hard to take time off in the start of a new job to interview. Since I already discussed and was shot down not sure what more to do without looking bad myself. Leaving a job so early in does not look good but I really did not expect this. 

If you have any advice on how to handle this, it's great appreciated. Thanks!
