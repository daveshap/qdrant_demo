PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN: You answered the door!
MARTY: You were ringing the doorbell!
PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN: I told you not to interfere with any of the events of this time! Nobody's supposed to see you here! What if I was a mailman? Or a salesman?
MARTY: What if you lost your keys?
PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN: Then I would have figured out to get back in through the events in the natural course of history! Don't you understand? The fabric of history is very delicate. Anything you do could have serious consequences!
MARTY: Hey, look, gimme a break! All I did was answer the door! How's that gonna change history?
PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN: I don't know, but I don't want to take any chances! Now you stay here and don't do anything. Don't answer the door, don't answer the phone, don't go outside. Understand?
