SELENA: I said stop, I didn't say run into a brick wall.
BIANCA: What is it?
SELENA: The Coffer of Shadow. Look at it.
SELENA: What does it mean?
BIANCA: The danger. The one Nigel spoke of. It must be near .
SELENA: Oh, fiddlesticks. What could be dangerous about a baseball game?

SELENA: It must be the girls. One of the girls.
BIANCA: But which one?
SELENA: Drive on. We have already attracted enough attention.
SELENA: We'll bide our time and keep watch. Young girls just can't keep a secret. If one of them's up to something--we'll find out.
BIANCA: And then, like great cats---we pounce! And destroy!
SELENA: Bianca, try not to be so bloodthirsty when you're at the wheel. OK?
BIANCA: Sorry, mistress.
