TYRELL: You're the most beautiful woman in the bar tonight, Jules.
JULIE: Tyrell, you are an unstoppable force of nature.
TYRELL: That's right. It's how the species survives. You'll never convince me otherwise. Wanna dance?
KARLA: Say yes.
JULIE: No.
KARLA: No means yes.
JULIE: Tyrell, I appreciate it, but have you seen my people dance? We make the mouth face, we move the fingers --
TYRELL: Worse comes to worse, you can stand there and watch me.
KARLA: Come on, I'll take a break and we'll all dance.
JULIE: Karla! Did you tell him I'd be here?
KARLA: Nope. I told him that you absolutely, positively would not be here at this bar between ten o'clock and eleven o'clock tonight. And then he came anyway.
WILL: This was not my idea.
JULIE: What?
WILL: I said, this...Do you want a drink?
