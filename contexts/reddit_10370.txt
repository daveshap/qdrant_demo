I wish my problems were normal teenager problems
I want to be normal more than anything. I want to be grounded for sneaking out with friends instead of my parents desperately trying to make me get involved with other peers my age. I want to be tired because I stayed up late on my phone, not because I couldn’t sleep due to trauma. I want to cry alone in my room because I’m going through a bad breakup, not because I’m planning my suicide. Etc. I never feel like I can relate to other kids my age because our problems are completely different. It sounds bad but I’d give anything to be like everyone else
