DECKER: The fault is here, sir, not in the transmission. The antenna leads have been disconnected. V'ger never intended to accept a transmitted signal.
KIRK: Capture God! In order to retrieve V'ger's data, the Creator has to physically come here!...
DECKER: And plug the signal directly into the circuitry at this... ... point here, Captain. It should pick up even a tricorder playback.
KIRK: Enterprise, I want that signal again. Transmit!
SPOCK: Jim... he <U>wants</U> it.
DECKER: You got the Enterprise, it's what <U>you</U> wanted. This is what I want. But, Jim... ... <U>I'm</U> the right choice for this mission.
