VIRIDIANA: I hardly know him. I saw him only once, some years ago. I can't even remember him.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: In any case he's asking you to come and stay with him.
VIRIDIANA: I don't want to leave the convent, Mother.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: I'm afraid that his health is not good. He's your only relative and you ought to say farewell to him before taking your vows. You will certainly never see him again.
VIRIDIANA: But why does he want to see me? He has never bothered about me.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: He has paid for your studies and your maintenance, and he has just sent your dowry. Does that mean so little to you, Viridiana?
VIRIDIANA: I have no desire to see the world again, but if you order me to...
MOTHER SUPERIOR: The retreat will start soon. You can leave tomorrow morning.
