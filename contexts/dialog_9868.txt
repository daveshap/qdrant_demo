DRAMA TEACHER: This is the answer: a subscription drive to Voice of Action!" First prize is a trip to Moscow! You could visit the art theatre
FRANCES: But I'll never win that.
DRAMA TEACHER: Yes, yes, it's all arranged. Everyone's collecting subscriptions in your name. And the best part is: the trip returns you to New York.
FRANCES: Really?
DRAMA TEACHER: New York, Frances! Broadway! This is your chance! You belong on the stage!
FRANCES: Thank you.
FRANCES: Hi, Harry. Did you see the play?
HARRY: You think I'd miss it?
FRANCES: Well? What'd you think?
HARRY: I just wanted to see how you looked.
FRANCES: How'd I look?
HARRY: Enh.
FRANCES: Don't be a rat, Harry.
HARRY: You looked okay. Joint's pretty dead. How 'bout I take you home?
