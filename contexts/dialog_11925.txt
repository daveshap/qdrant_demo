KARA: Beth, who's that guy that lives across the hall from you?
BETH: Why? You interested?
KARA: No! I keep seeing him staring out his window. Watching me.
BETH: You mean Tommy. Yeah, on the weirdness scale he's about an eleven. Supposedly some scary shit happened to him when he was a kid. Messed up his head. He's harmless, though. Probably just lonely.
