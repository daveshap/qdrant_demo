How to reset or rebuild application search database in ios? I am having a strange problem on ios. When i search for any app by typing its name in the search screen, the corresponding app shows up, WITH THE EXCEPTION, of firefox for ios. Its odd to me that my firefox app is completely ommitred from search results and I have to manually find the app each time I want to use it. Is there a way to rebuild the app search database in ios?
