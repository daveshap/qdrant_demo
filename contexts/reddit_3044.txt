Anyone else had post job search anxiety?
Over the past 4 years I've spent the better part of 2 years unemployed, with the other 2 years with a company that became a hot bed of mismanagement and exclusionary bullying. After leaving that job I spent another 6 months looking for work. I've now started a part-time role but I can't seem to shake my unemployment anxiety, with constant feelings of inadequacy and fighting this constant urge to give up and quit at the slightest inconvenience (which is uncharacteristic, I have 3 degrees) . Anyone else ever experienced this? Is it normal/ have a name?
