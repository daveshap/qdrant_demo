Just got FIRED today and I donâ€™t know what to do!
So today started off just as any normal day would. I got to work and logged in. Started performing my daily tasks and attending meetings. 

Suddenly, out of the blue, I am pulled into a 1:1 conference and they tell me I am being let go. It was completely final and I was left speechless. Now I am here with all of these looming thoughts in my head, trying to make sense of it. 

I plan to take a couple days, and then try to get back on my feet but I am really in need of some advice or even similar personal experiences and how you got out of it. I feel slightly depressed and defeated right now. I only have about 15K saved up. I am 27 years old. Can someone please talk me through this...
