Quitting a job with nothing lined up due to mental health - terrible idea?
Hello all,

I’m at a crossroads and need some advice. Would quitting a job without something lined up be a huge black mark on my record? I’m currently at a job in high net worth wealth management that’s making me absolutely miserable. I love my company overall, but my current team’s culture is toxic and rife with bullies. We’re also working on a soul crushing project through the end of the year which has and will continue to require a great deal of mandatory overtime on nights and weekends. 

I would normally never go against the conventional wisdom to not leave a job before you have a job, but I think pushing through much longer will break me. I’m at the point where I’m having nightly panic attacks due to how much I dread having to go to the office the next day. I’ve also starting having suicidal ideations where I imagine killing myself in the office specifically. I would never act on these thoughts (I think), but the fact that I’m having them at all is worrisome.

I know my situation isn’t healthy, but I’m terrified of quitting with nothing else lined up as I live in a highly competitive and high cost of living area (San Francisco Bay Area). I’m so overwhelmed with the hours I’m working that I can’t even begin to think of applying and interviewing to new jobs, let alone get the mental health help I need. I’m also worried that quitting won’t even give me the relief I’m so desperately craving as I’ll likely be too stressed over being unemployed to fully relax and contemplate what I want. Additionally, I fear the the problem isn’t the job, but me. A part of me thinks I’m just a deeply sad person who will be just as miserable at my next gig, so there’s a chance I would be giving up my career only to end up just as miserable. What are my chances of landing an equivalent or better job if I take time off in order to protect my wellbeing? 

A bit about me for context:
