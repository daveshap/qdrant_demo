WILLOW: I hope she's all right. How much more do I have to do of this?
RAZIEL: Till it's in a powder. The energy exits within you...
WILLOW: I know, and the magician's goal is to find his true self. But what's this got to do with it?
RAZIEL: As below, so above. You hold the univers, Willow, in your hand.
MADMARTIGAN: I'm beginning to think you two *deserve* to be locked up.
WILLOW: The universe is a living creature, like you and me, Madmartigan.
MADMARTIGAN: We're a tiny version of all that?
RAZIEL: As above, so below.
WILLOW: I'm all finished. Now what?
RAZIEL: Burn it to a fine ash.
WILLOW: How am I gonna do that?
RAZIEL: Patience. Concentrate. You will find a way.
