MILTON: I'm sure we'll both make it...but just in case one of us...well, is there a message you'd like me to give someone?
BERNICE: No. I'm all alone.
MILTON: Just in case I don't have a chance to say goodbye, I want you to know that I haven't spent so many pleasant hours for many years.
BERNICE: That's a very nice compliment, and I'd like to say that...you've done the same for me.
