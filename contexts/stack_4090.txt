Visiting Canada by land and back My wife and I are New Zealand citizens and Mexico residents. We are driving across the US and thinking about traveling into Canada from Michigan and back into the US at Niagara falls or thereabouts.I found a page on the Canada immigration website suggesting that an \"ETA\" isn't required for NZ citizens when entering by land, however reading further all references are to flying in and requiring the ETA. Is it correct that the ETA is not needed?  We have US B1/B2 visas with I-94 permits issued at the US/Mexico border. Am I right to assume these are just as valid when re-entering the US at the US/Canada border?
