Questions for an interview with a startup
Hi, I have an upcoming interview with a start up company. I've worked for a "start up" previously, though that was far more established than what this company appears to be. So along those lines, the though of moving my family across the country for something that is less certain than my current job is a big concern. 

I'm looking for some questions to ask to vet the company when I have this interview. Technically I feel comfortable with a back and forth with the interviewer, but for the business side, I'm less sure.

Does anyone have some ideas of what to ask?
