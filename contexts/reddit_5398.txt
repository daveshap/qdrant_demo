Coworker did not get fired, but was "laid off" because the company feared a lawsuit. Is this common?
My coworker had been caught deliberately falsifying his time sheets, driving Uber during work, over-billing clients, and other infractions which I thought would warrant my company, an engineering firm, firing him for cause. It got so bad that our client wouldn't even let him work on their contracts anymore. 

My company eventually fired him for "lack of available work," which is BS because they were attempting to hire a new employee around the same time they fired him. Another coworker told me that they couldn't outright fire him for cause because they feared he would sue the company for discrimination or favoritism. This could have been the perception if we hired someone right after he was fired. This decision apparently came from our company's general counsel. 

The employee that was fired was African American and had been heard muttering about how the company was racist at the client's office. But the local office of my company has 17 employees, three of which are African Americans, two of whom have been there for almost 10 years.  While I can't say conclusively that there isn't any racism in our office, I personally have found no evidence of it. However, I could find plenty of evidence of the fired coworker's infractions.

TL;DR: Coworker was effectively laid off instead of fired because there was a risk he would sue for discrimination.

Which leads me to the following questions: 

1. Is it more common to lay off employees than fire them because of the risk of legal retaliation? 
2. How could an employer fire a POC for cause if they could always claim racism or discrimination was the reason for  their firing? 
3. How can an employer hire someone to replace an employee who should be fired if the hiring of someone new is retroactive evidence of favoritism or discrimination?
