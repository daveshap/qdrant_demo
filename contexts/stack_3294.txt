Is Dumbledore still on par with Voldemort after wounding his hand by the curse in Marvolo Gaunt's ring before the start of book 6?

Does this suggest that the curse slightly diminished Dumbledore's power, and Dumbledore is now weaker than Voldemort, so this prompted Rufus Scrimgeour to place more Aurors around Hogwarts to guard the campus?
