What is the range of electric field of an photon? Obviously every electric field has an specific range upto which it can have effect on.What is the range from the median line for an electric field of a photon.As most physics textbooks and physicist visualize the electric field of an photon as straight line and also the electric field has only one electric field strength at an instant.How this visulaization affect the range.Does it have effect on particles on the left and right side of the straight line that we visualized.This may be a bizzare question,but we got to understand everything about it to manipulate it.So please give your best opinions,Thank you.
