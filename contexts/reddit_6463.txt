Follow work or passion?
I am a seasoned data engineer but in whatsoever company I go, do not get the true data eng work. Most of the time it is managing or some software eng work. At the time of interviews, the JD looks pretty good but when I enter the company the project they put me in something diff. This becomes a little frustrating and made me change several times within the span of 6-7 yrs. What do you suggest , i shall do? Keep working in a company without much passion or shall I keep looking untill I find a work where I am passionately involved?
