NIKON: Biggest crash in history, front page, New York Times, August 10th, 1988. I thought you was black, man! Yo, man, this is Zero Cool! Oh, shit!
CEREAL: That's far out!
NIKON: This is Zero Cool, man! Whooo, haha!
KATE: Well that's great. There goes MIT.
DADE: I'll make it up to you!
KATE: How?
DADE: I'll hack the Gibson.
NIKON: They'll trace you like that man, cops are gonna find you, they're gonna find you with a smoking gun.
DADE: Fucked if I care, man.
NIKON: Look, even if you had the passwords, it'll take you ten minutes to get in, and you've still gotta find the files, man, I mean, the cops will have you in... five minutes.
CEREAL: Oh wow, we are fried.
KATE: Never send a boy to do a woman's job. With me, we can do it in seven.
CEREAL: You're both screwed. I help, we can do it in six.
NIKON: Jesus, I gotta save all your asses. I help, we can do it in five minutes, man.
DADE: Okay. Let's go shopping.
