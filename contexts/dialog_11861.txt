ANNIE: Get him out of here!
LINDSEY: Here, Lester.
ANNIE: I hate that dog. I'm the only person in the world he doesn't like.
LAURIE: What's this big, big news?
ANNIE: What would you say if I told you that you were going to the Homecoming Dance tomorrow night?
LAURIE: I'd say you must have the wrong number.
ANNIE: Well, I just talked with Ben Tramer and he got real excited when I told him how attracted you were to him.
LAURIE: Annie, you didn't. Tell me you didn't.
ANNIE: You guys will make a fabulous couple.
TOMMY: Laurie...
LAURIE: I'm so embarrassed. I couldn't face him...
ANNIE: You'll have to. He's calling you tomorrow to find out what time to pick you up.
LAURIE: Annie!
