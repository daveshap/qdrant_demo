Can I play/practice Fortnite's Battle Royale locally? Is it possible to be play Battle Royale in some sort of local environment?I'm not too great at some aspects of the game and would like to practice in my own time and pace and not worry about a sniper bullet or the storm, similarly to how you can play CS:GO or Overwatch on any map, by yourself, with all sorts of various settings changed. Has anything like that been implemented (yet) ?I haven't bought Save the World, just the f2p game.
