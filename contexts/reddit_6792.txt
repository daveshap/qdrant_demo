Two recruiters in the same week miss my phone screen interview times? (auto reply stating recruiter on vacation?? üòê0.o)
This has to be the most ridiculous and stressful week. I have had 4 back to back interviews for different companies. Countless studying on tech things and interview prep. I seriously baffled that this has happened twice in one week. I schedule an interview just for it to be delayed and its all on the recruiters end and not mine.

Whats ironic about this whole thing is that if i were to miss my interview they would automatically let me go but they as recruiters can be unprofessional and not state a thing. I was also scheduled with another person and not the recruiter.

Here is the thing from what I gathered from this. The recruiter who contacted me didnt want to do the phone screening so the recruiter assigned someone else to do it which is why the recruiter avoided the day I stated to do it which was yesterday. I wondering if there is a conflict with this recruiter and the other person lol. Who does that?? So i guess the person who was assigned is  like f this im not doing it. I guess they are just losing a great candidate because i recently got an offer that was 10k higher than theirs lmfao

This is weird and really unprofessional. My big question is will they throw my application out because the whole position that i applied for and was selected for starts in a week they told me and the recruiter told me they arent available after thursday :/
