TRENT: I wish the game still had fights so I could bitch-slap Wayne.
MIKE: This version doesn't have fighting?
TRENT: No. Doesn't that suck?
MIKE: What? That was the best part of the old game.
SUE: I don't know. I guess kids were hitting each other or something.
TRENT: You could make their heads bleed, though.
SUE: Yeah... If you hit them hard their heads bleed all over the ice and their legs convulse.
MIKE: No.
TRENT: Yeah.
SUE: It's kinda money, actually.
MIKE: Make someone bleed.
SUE: No, man, we're in the play-offs.
