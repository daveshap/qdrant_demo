Rejected but with a silver lining. How can I leverage it and turn it into something positive?
I went into an interview last Friday for a small wallpaper company (5-6 person) and the interviewer was impressed by my works, and said she will reach out by today. Still, I mentally brace myself for a rejection from my experience last 3 months. 

This morning, I did got a rejection as I anticipated.  She told me that  they're impressed by my works, but they feel like I'm overqualified as they won't be able to give me tasks that would unleash my potential. However, there's a silver lining as she said she will forward my reference to her colleague that is a professional designer in the city, which I assume is the owner of the firm since the interviewer did mentioned that the owner is a well connected designer in the city (Portland OR FYI, which is an incredibly hard market to break into), and the firm has only a handful of employees around. I have already sent her a thank you note letting me know their decisions, and I plan to leverage this feedback and turn it into something useful. (At least I know it's not a robotic email)

My plan is to give her a call and told her that I acknowledged that email I received, and ask to stay in touch with email and ask for a connection on LinkedIn, though I'm not sure which profile is hers since she wasn't listed at the firm that she's currently working at. My question is, do you think it's appropriate to give her a call to acknowledge the email and ask to keep in touch through LinkedIn? To be honest I really feel like this is a very bold move, as any missteps could jeopardize my future.
