MERCUTIO: Calm, Dishonorable, Vile Submission! Thou art my souls hate! Tybalt! You ratcatcher, will you walk?
TYBALT: What wouldst thou have with me?
MERCUTIO: Good king of cat's, nothing but one of your nine lives.
TYBALT: I am for you.
ROMEO: Forbear this outrage, good Mercutio.
BENVOLIO: Art thou hurt?
MERCUTIO: Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch. Ay, a scratch, a scratch. HA HA HA.
ROMEO: Courage man, the hurt can not be much.
MERCUTIO: 'Twill serve. Ask for me tomorrow and you shall find me a grave man. A plague o' both your houses. They have made worms meat of me. A plague on both your Houses! Why the devil did you come between us? I was hurt under your arm.
ROMEO: I thought all for the best.
MERCUTIO: A Plague o' both your houses.
ROMEO: NO! Mercutio!
JULIET: Come gentle night. Come loving black-browned night give me my Romeo. And when I shall die, take him and cut him out into little stars, and he will make the face of heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun. O, I have bought the mansion of love but not possessed, and though I am sold, not yet enjoyed. O, tedious is this day, as the night before some festival to an impatient child that hath new robes and may not wear them.
ROMEO: Mercutio's soul is but a little way above our heads staying for thine to keep him company!
