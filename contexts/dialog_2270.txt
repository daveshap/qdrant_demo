STEED: Doctor Peel, I presume?
EMMA: And you must be Steed. Please don't get up.
STEED: I was about to throw in the towel.
EMMA: I had a spot of bother at the door.
STEED: I shouldn't wonder. Not a woman inside Boodles since --
EMMA: 1922. Why the kippers?
STEED: Red herring would have been too obvious, don't you think?
EMMA: So what was all this -- some sort of test?
STEED: Congratulations, you've penetrated a bastion of male privilege. I guessed you weren't a stickler for Tradition, doctor.
EMMA: Whereas you are.
STEED: Dyed in the wool. But I can admire someone who doesn't play by the rules.
EMMA: Rules are made to be broken.
STEED: Not by me. Play by the rules, Doctor, or the game is nothing.
EMMA: And just what is the game?
STEED: I say, this is all terribly formal. Must I go an calling you Dr. Peel?
EMMA: Under the circumstances, you may call me Mrs. Peel.
STEED: Much better.
EMMA: And now that we've settled the matter of honorifics, will you kindly explain why you wished me to meet you?
STEED: I didn't. Mother did.
EMMA: Mother?
