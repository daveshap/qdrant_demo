Start working remote, could you give me some advice?
Hi guys, I am thinking to start working remote for a new company but I am afraid of not being able to spend some time with other people and clear my head up. In my previous companies, I was always on-site, and while this meant for me to commute for almost an hour, I ended up having great professional relationships in and out of the office. Doing coffee breaks, team lunches, etc. Now I fear that this will no longer be the case as everything will be remote. Does this feeling happen to you as well? How do you connect with people working remotely too? Any platform or suggestion?
