Where are the server \"alternate\" installer images? Long time user of Ubuntu, particularly 14.04 LTS.  Trying to do a fresh install on a new set of HDs with 18.04 LTS.  I have used 14.04 LTS on RAID 1 boot drives and want to do the same with 18.04 LTS.Historically I've used the \"alternate\" installer images to create my RAID partitions, etc. because the \"standard\" installer inexplicably does not support RAID installations, but those images seem to have disappeared from the download site / mirrors some time ago (I think coincident with 16.04 LTS).  Problem is the download page STILL refers to alternate installers and it provides a link that presently points to the 18.04 release directory but there are no alternate installers in that location.Where are the alternate install images?If they don't exist, is there another way to install 18.04 over RAID 1?I am completely content with a text based installer and doing the filesystem layout manually.  I don't want or need a GUI installer.Thanks for any help.
