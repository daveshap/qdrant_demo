HOWELL: How did you get this number?
TALLEY: Mr. Jones is dead. So are two of his men. The other three are in jail. I have the disks. I have Walter Smith. And you know what, you motherfucker? I have you.
HOWELL: I have your fucking family. Don't forget that.
TALLEY: I also have a couple of million in cash. Call Sonny Benza. Ask if I can keep it.
HOWELL: What do you want?
TALLEY: My wife and my daughter and the money. I'll bring the disks to the mall by the freeway, you bring my family. We'll trade.
HOWELL: Fuck that! You think I'm crazy?!
TALLEY: I think you got no choice.
HOWELL: Fuck the mall. You know that motel on the road west of town?
TALLEY: Yeah.
HOWELL: You got ten minutes. If you're one minute late, we won't be here to find.
BELDONE: The house is in flames, Benza's accountant is with the cops, and they're stacking the bodies like cordwood.
CASTELLANO: Jesus Christ, it's a clusterfuck.
BELDONE: You wanted to let Sonny handle it. I would've moved in when we first found out.
CASTELLANO: And by doing so, he would've known we have spies in his organization.
BELDONE: Yes, sir. But what about the disks? If the cops end up with the disks, we're gonna see a whole lot of heat.
CASTELLANO: I hate that Mickey Mouse bastard. I hated his father, and I hate Sonny, too. Always with the tan.
BELDONE: What do you want to do?
CASTELLANO: Our people out there, they good people? People in the right place?
BELDONE: The best.
CASTELLANO: Sonny's a fuckup. If he pulls this off, fine--life goes on. But if the cops end up with those disks, we cut our losses.
BELDONE: I understand.
CASTELLANO: I want a message sent: No fuckups allowed.
BELDONE: I'll make the call.
