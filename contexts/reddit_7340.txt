Tips for learning how to drive a forklift?
I've had previous experience using an electric jack and a walkie stacker but never a forklift that you drive. I started a new job and told them I was interested in learning how to drive one. The very first day they let me get on one to try it out but I had an incredibly difficult time with it, particularly turning the forklift so that the prongs fit underneath the pallets in the bin.

My question is, what is the best way to turn it in a precise matter? Is it better to just come at a pallet almost perpendicular like a "T" and do a 90 degree turn THEN go forward, or are you supposed to turn in one fluid motion? I think it's awkward for me because I'm used to a car having a moving front axle, not a rear axle. I kept turning too early and it was INCREDIBLY embarrassing, as the other 3 guys that were with me training seemed to have no trouble at all driving and moving palettes. I ask because I will continue trying to learn it and I don't want to keep embarrassing myself each time I try. Would love to pick it up much more quickly if anyone has tips.
