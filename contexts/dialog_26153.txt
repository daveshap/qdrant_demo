MAJOR KONG: Lieutenant Zogg, what do our orders say about the authentication of orders during an attack mission?
LT. ZOGG: Look, this is different.
MAJOR KONG: Our orders warn us to expect the enemy to use ingenuity in issuing contrary and confusing orders. And therefore, to disregard anything that doesn't come on the CRM-114.
LT. ZOGG: But the CRM-114 has been smashed for almost an hour.
MAJOR KONG: Then that settles it, doesn't it?
LT. ZOGG: Like hell it does.
MAJOR KONG: The CRM-114 is smashed, right?
LT. ZOGG: Right. So how could we get any messages?
MAJOR KONG: That's the point.
LT. ZOGG: I don't get you, King.
MAJOR KONG: I said that's the point!
LT. ZOGG: Look, King, maybe you've lost too much blood, or something.
MAJOR KONG: Lieutentant Zogg, how would you like your black butt slung into a General Court Martial when we get back???
LT. ZOGG: Take it easy, Major Kong.
MAJOR KONG: Then get off my back!
