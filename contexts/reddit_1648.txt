Unpopular Opinion: If you’re waiting to hear back from an Ivy, let go and give up.
Having a spot on a waitlist gives so many students an unhealthy hope of getting into an Ivy when they should be moving on with their lives and college plans. It’s unfair and emotionally taxing to students when Ivies put just as many students on a waitlist as the amount of students they accept. So please, accept that you will not get into an Ivy and increase my chances of getting off the UPenn waitlist. Thank you very much.
