Shout out to the guy who concocted an entire list of reasons why he couldn't be in a serious relationship...and then was in a serious relationship 2 weeks after we ended
Shout out to you sir. We see you. You were very convincing. Every reason you gave, from "I'll be moving soon and can't be tied down" to "I have way too much going on in my life/too many balls in the air to devote time to seriously dating" to "my previous relationship really did a number on me and I'm more cautious now" to "I just want to make sure we're a solid match first" to whatever else you came up with that I can't even remember...the performance alone was Oscar worthy. You must have really done some soul searching in those two weeks between our "breakup" and you going Facebook official with a new girl. Some serious inner work as well as all your supposed previous roadblocks suddenly being non-existent. Well played.

Remember kids, it's never "I'm not looking for a serious relationship". It's only "I'm not looking for a serious relationship with you". This sub is right.
