PHIL: Who was that?
JULIE: I'm having the floor fixed,
PHIL: And what was that neighbor guy doing here?
JULIE: Philip, what are <u>you</u> doing here?
PHIL: Look, I think we should work things out.
PHIL: I was having a bad day -- I lost that job, I was dependent on other people, I was let down --
JULIE: There's always an excuse, isn't there?
PHIL: I think it's time I came home now.
JULIE: That's not a decision for you to make on your own.
PHIL: What?
JULIE: No, Philip, I don't want you coming back here. And if you want to talk to me -- <u>call</u>.
PHIL: This is my house.
JULIE: I apologize for that scene with my husband. You must have overheard.
HIDER: An occupational hazard, I'm afraid.
JULIE: I bet. Going into people's homes.
HIDER: It's a living.
JULIE: Do you have a family?
HIDER: Uh, no -- I've never really found the time to settle down.
JULIE: You must value your independence.
HIDER: Yeah, I've always been able to make my way in the world. I don't like having to rely on other people.
JULIE: It's nice that you can make that choice.
HIDER: I was alone a lot as a child. No one to compete with. My parents ensured that I found happiness in the smallest things. When you're all alone it's your own world, you don't have to take orders from anybody. You don't necessarily believe the stories people tell you.
JULIE: Not me, I fell for it right down the line. Be a good girl and believe all the fairy tales. He married me because I was pretty.
HIDER: Because you <u>were</u> pretty?
THERAPIST: Well, these are good signs -- she's broken up with him and the two of you seem to be developing quite a rapport.
HIDER: I <u>know</u>. I just feel that the relationship has reached that delicate stage where the slightest little thing could wreck the careful groundwork I've laid up till now.
THERAPIST: I can't help you if you don't help yourself. It's really up to you. Brooding endlessly isn't going to help matters any.
HIDER: There's so much I want to say to her, it's all jumbled up in my mind, and I don't want her to misunderstand --
THERAPIST: Well, you'll just have to <u>make</u> her understand.
