Laid off yesterday morning due to workforce reductions. Help??
So I got laid off from my first office job yesterday morning. Well, I went to lunch and they called me up as soon as I got back.  I only started there in early October, after seven months of trying to get an office job post graduation. 

I’m supposed to move into an apartment in a week. Already signed the lease. 

This is part rant part me panicking because I don’t know what to do. Got an interview at a temp agency later today, but honestly nothing they’ve got listed is anything I’m qualified for at all. I’m just. Super super panicked right now. I don’t have to be, once I get this apartment situation fixed and hopefully out of this lease then maybe it’ll be better.  

It’s just. I thought I’d gotten out of retail for good (I have an awful back and retail messes with it badly) and my health was improving and now I just. I don’t know what I’m going to do. 

How DOES one get an office job quickly??
