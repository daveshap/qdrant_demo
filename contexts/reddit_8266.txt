What evidence is there to suggest that the NRA could be classified as a terrorist organization?
[The San Francisco Board of Supervisors has declared the National Rifle Association a "domestic terrorist organization."](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/sf-board-of-supervisors-declare-nra-a-domestic-terrorist-organization/ar-AAGM1YH) The resolution:

- cites "an epidemic of gun violence"
- refers to the US Department of Justice's definition of terrorism, "The use of any...explosive, firearm, or other weapon or dangerous device, with intent to endanger, directly or indirectly, the safety of one or more individuals or to cause substantial damage to property;"
- claims that the NRA uses its influence to "incite violence," "spreads propaganda that misinforms and aims to deceive the public about the dangers of gun violence," and "promotes extremist positions."

[The U.S. Code defines "domestic terrorism" as:](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2331)

> the term “domestic terrorism” means activities that—
> (A) involve acts dangerous to human life that are a violation of the criminal laws of the United States or of any State;
> (B) appear to be intended—
>   (i) to intimidate or coerce a civilian population;
>   (ii) to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or
>   (iii) to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping; and
> (C) occur primarily within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States; and

- From which Department of Justice document is the San Francisco Board of Supervisors citing the definition of terrorism? (I did a cursory web search, but most of the results were from news of the NRA's classification and I could not find the source of the definition.)
- Does the NRA meet the definition of a terrorist organization?
- Are there any examples of the NRA spreading misinformation, inciting violence, or fuelling extremism?
