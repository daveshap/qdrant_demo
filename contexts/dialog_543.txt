PATRIZIA: And here's Sandro. Why don't you two go upstairs and change?
SANDRO: Yes, we will.
PATRIZIA: Did you manage to find good rooms?
SANDRO: They didn't seem too good.
PATRIZIA: You should have told Ettore. He always manages to get what he wants.
SANDRO: Ettore must be fed up with me by now.
PATRIZIA: Oh, no, not at all. And then you know very well that he'll forgive you anything; just as long as you admit to him that you're a worse driver than he is...
CLAUDIA: How do you manage to put up with all this confusion? You always said people bore you.
PATRIZIA: You shouldn't always take me seriously. Actually, I'm used to it by now. First my mother and now my husband; both of them are like dynamos.
SANDRO: Your mother?
PATRIZIA: Yes, even I had a mother. She was part Austrian, but she was still my mother. My childhood was like a tennis match; they bounced me back and forth, here and there...
CLAUDIA: My childhood, instead, was a very sensible one.
PATRIZIA: What do you mean by sensible?
CLAUDIA: It means being without money.
