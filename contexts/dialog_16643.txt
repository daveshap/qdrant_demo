QUINCY: So how come you could play basketball?
MONICA: I just can.
QUINCY: I never knew a girl that could play.
MONICA: My Mom says she doesn't know where I come from 'cause I act different.
QUINCY: Your Dad play?
MONICA: He works at a bank.
QUINCY: My Dad plays for the Clippers." He says I'ma be a doctor or a lawyer
MONICA: I'm going to be number thirty-two, like Magic.
QUINCY: He's alright, but my Dad can take him.
MONICA: What was the most points your Daddy ever got in Junior High?
QUINCY: I don't know. A lot.
MONICA: One time Magic scored forty-eight points, and they only had six minute quarters and he sat out the whole fourth.
QUINCY: You do act different.
MONICA: I don't care.
QUINCY: Well, if anybody bothers you, you could just tell me cause I run this street.
MONICA: I'd just tell my sister, Lena.
QUINCY: She don't know how to box, I bet. My dad showed me how to fight like Ali.
