NIXON: This will get me a second term. Damn it, without risk, there's no heroism. There's no history. I, Nixon, was born to do this.
KISSINGER: Mr. President, this cannot be breathed! Especially to our secretary of state -- that cretin Rogers ... The Chinese would never trust us again. The only way, I emphasize only way, to pull this off is in secret.
NIXON: This is a major coup, gentlemen -- our own State Department doesn't even know. And if it leaks out of here tonight ...
HALDEMAN: Well, one way or the other, Kent State is not good. We have to get out in front of this thing. The PR is going to murder us.
NIXON: Money. Follow the money.
HALDEMAN: Sir?
NIXON: These kids are being manipulated by the Communists. Like Chambers and Hiss.
MITCHELL: This isn't '48, Dick. They'll never buy it.
NIXON: How do you know that, John? Did we try? Are we just giving up like the rest of 'em? What's Hoover found, for God's sake?
