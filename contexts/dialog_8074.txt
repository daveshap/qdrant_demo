TREVES: Now I think we really do understand one another.
BYTES: Right... Right.
CARR: Singularly unpleasant chap... uh... I don't suppose there would be any harm in my meeting your... patient, Mr. Treves.
TREVES: Thank you very much Sir. Shall we say in a few days then?
CARR: Shall we say two o'clock tomorrow afternoon?
TREVES: Wh... whatever is most convenient for you, sir.
CARR: Two o'clock then... you know Treves... It seems this acquaintance of yours has become rather more than just an acquaintance.
TREVES: ...Yes, Sir.
