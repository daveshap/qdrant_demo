YU: We must be careful. Governor Yu is a court official, and in charge of security. Any disturbance will cast suspicion on him. It might get Sir Te in trouble.
SIR TE: This is a delicate matter.
YU: Sir Te, can you find some excuse to invite Madam Yu and her daughter?
SIR TE: What do you have in mind?
YU: The best way to trap a fox is through her cubs.
MADAM YU: Madam Te is certainly spoiling us with these wedding gifts. She's being so considerate.
YU: I'm sorry she's not feeling well enough to receive you today.
MADAM YU: I heard Sir Te lost something. And now Madame Te's not feeling well...
YU: We know who stole the missing item. If the thief returns it, I'm sure Sir Te will pursue the matter no further.
MADAM YU: That's good. Sometimes the help can't keep their hands to themselves. It's very embarassing.
YU: Sir Te knows that even well-meaning people can make mistakes... that can bring ruin to themselves and their families.
MADAM YU: But don't be too lenient.
YU: No mercy will be shown toward the murderer who turned up in Peking.
MADAM YU: A murderer?
YU: Yes. The very killer of Li Mu Bai's own master. Last night, she killed a policeman who had tracked her down.
MADAM YU: A female criminal! Now that's news!
JEN: You say she killed a policeman?
YU: Yes, from the West. He went undercover and and followed her here,
MADAM YU: Maybe the murderer and the thief are one and the same.
YU: I doubt it. This thief... it very unusual...
