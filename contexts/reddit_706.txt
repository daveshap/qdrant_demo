Why do I fuck everything up?
I love my boyfriend but sometimes I feel like I don’t want a relationship. We took a break a while back and I missed him so we got back. But I keep screwing things up and I love him with all of my heart but I feel like I don’t want to be in a relationship. I don’t know what to do
