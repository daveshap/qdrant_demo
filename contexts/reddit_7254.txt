Manufacturing work? CNC, PLC, welding, machining?
I just got my associates in Information Systems. I couldnt find any good paying tech jobs but found a good position in another insustry. I now work as a maintanence technician for $15 an hr and i like what we do. I am now wanting to take trade classes and get a certificate (cnc machine operator). What are some some good classes/skills to take or learn that will help me make more?
