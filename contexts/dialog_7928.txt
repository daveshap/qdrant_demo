ED: Did you see that kid grab Vampira's tits?
BELA: I envied him. Hell, I envied you too, having a girlfriend that would jump in front of a car like that.

BELA: Eddie, I want to thank you. These last few days have been a good time.
ED: I just wish you coulda seen the movie.
BELA: No problem. I know it by heart...
