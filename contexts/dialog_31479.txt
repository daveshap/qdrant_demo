VICKI: We should live together.
WALTER: Live together.
VICKI: Move in with me.
WALTER: It's a bad idea.
VICKI: I think it's a fucking good idea.
WALTER: I don't even know how to live with myself.
VICKI: Just think about it.
WALTER: I've got problems.
VICKI: Who doesn't?
WALTER: Most people don't have my kind of problems.
VICKI: Guess that makes you pretty special.
WALTER: That's not what I meant.
WALTER: I say we call it quits.
VICKI: Fine.
