A helpful SciHub browser extension
I've been using this extension for about a month now (my University does have institutional subscriptions to some of the more obscure journals I need access to), I highly recommend it.

If you find yourself at a paywall, you just click the icon, and if the paper is on SciHub it downloads the PDF: simple, fast, effective.
