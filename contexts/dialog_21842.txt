ROSE: There ain't nobody here, Mr. Hillyer! Honest, there ain't!
DADDY: Where is he? Where have you got him hid? Ah, ha!
DADDY: And who, Rose, may I ask, is that?
ROSE: Well, it's Billy.
DADDY: And what, may I ask, was Billy doing here?
ROSE: Well, Mr. Hillyer, Billy's very poor, he don't have no money and there wasn't no place else to go.
DADDY: Well, it was a silly question.
ROSE: He's a nice boy, you'd like him. He wants to be a fireman.
DADDY: Ye gods and little fishes, a fireman. Put on some clothes, Rose, you're naked as a jay bird. When you're dressed, come on downstairs. I'm afraid your friend Billy is injured, where are his clothes?
ROSE: Under the mattress. I hid 'em so you wouldn't be mad. He wants to marry me, he loves me. I can't marry him, he's too young and hasn't got no job, but he loves me... now you wouldn't hurt him, would you?
