NICK: This is a goddamn disaster. Let's just pack it up and go.
ANNA: I want to see the tapes.
NICK: And what do you possibly think you're going to fucking see there?
ANNA: No idea. But if that's all we've got left--
COTTER: --nothing left to play 'em on, honey.
ANNA: Oh, sorry, right.
COTTER: You can be goddamn sure, though, I'm going to be looking at every second of 'em when I get back to Baltimore--I get proof who stole my shit and I call the cops!
ANNA: We're ticketed to fly back from Baltimore, anyway.
HEATHER: Me, too.
COTTER: Hey, I got a whole editing suite in my loft--more the fucking merrier.
NICK: Pointless.
DOMINI: No. I don't think so.
COTTER: 403 41st Street, kids: home.
NICK: I dunno it's safe to even get out of the car.
COTTER: By day? No sweat.
HEATHER: What about night?
COTTER: Not a great idea. Especially 'cross the street.
COTTER: Druid Hill Park.
ANNA: That's a joke?
COTTER: That's its name. A pastoral glade gamboling with crackheads and homeless and averaging at least one homicide a week.
NICK: Let's get inside.
COTTER: First enormous brick warehouse on your right.
COTTER: Used to be a meat-packing plant. Slaughter on the ground floor-- carcasses schlepped up on this thing for dissection and grinding and--
HEATHER: --Cotter: shut up.
COTTER: What?
NICK: Just one lock in this neighbor- hood?
COTTER: All I need--
COTTER: Get inside quick, they'll stop.
HEATHER: Too busy eating us?
COTTER: Just go.
