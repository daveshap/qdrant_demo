KITTY: I'm so sorry, Stu. I <u>wanted</u> to tell you what was going on. I really, really liked you.
STU: Kitty...<u>my</u> situation is really not important. The thing is, my girlfriend is now living with, and possibly engaged to, a demented monkey.
KITTY: You're such a beautiful man. Look at you - stuck in this place, and only thinking of her.
STU: Listen to me! Is there any way I can <u>warn</u> her what Monkeybone is up to??
