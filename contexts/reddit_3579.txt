Guys, at least act like you've talked to a woman before
I've had two separate 27 year old men say the uncoolest shit ever to me, today alone. One was going on about how he had never been to second base and then asked me if I had ever been to second base. And the other guy saying that his parents frequently cock block him when he tries to have "alone time with someone overnight". 
Like everyone progresses at their own pace, I don't care that you've never touched a girls tits, but the amount which you've talked about it is really concerning. I don't care that you live with your parents, I do too, but I don't want to hear about how they cock block you, read the fucking tone of the convo. 

Just act like you have some chill, try to be a little smooth. You make yourselves seem pathetic when you really don't have to. You're voluntarily bringing up unnecessary information and presenting it in an embarrassing manner. Just chill.
