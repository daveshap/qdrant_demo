Associates degrees or trades for career that won't have you pent up inside all day & will pay enough to buy my own house?
im in college majoring in biology bachelors degree. dumb decision, i already know. im trying to drop out for something else. i dont want to spend any more than two years in schooling anymore, it stresses the everloving hell out of me and any more than two years and id probably kill myself lol. the goals i want fulfilled are: a small house of my own in a friendly, quiet neighborhood (i dont want to be living in a ghetto apartment my whole life) and a job i semi enjoy (or atleast tolerate) that allows me to work mostly outdoors. preferably somewhere "out there" near the woods - i HATE big cities. what kind of career path would allow me to meet these goals? am i asking for too much?
