27 and never had a job, just sold my business, how to transition to career?
I've been running my small online business since I got out of highschool.

Learned a bunch of stuff along the way and was able to scale my digital services business to over $1.2m/yr in revenue. I am now selling the business for a very healthy sum, around $4M so I won't really have to worry about money too much.

I just want to invest that money and let it sit while I find some new work. I would love to work in online advertising or ecommerce, as these are 2 things I feel I know the most about.

I've gotten a resume professionally made and applied to a bunch of jobs in random pay ranges for these fields. $50k/yr SEO jobs to $200k/yr VP of eCommerce jobs.

I don't really get any replies. I don't have a degree or any job experience so it is hard to get interviews.

Online advertising/eCommerce are performance based industries, you either make money or lose money. Fairly binary. I have a 7+ year track record of 6 figure profits purely from my digital marketing acumen with the analytics to prove it.

How can I successfully angle my way in to the type of career I want?
