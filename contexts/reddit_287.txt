How do I ask my mother this sketchy question?
So I obviously need some advice. The advice I need is on how to bring up a question, and ask said question.

I need help on how to bring up and ask the question of, can my best female friend and I fly to a different state that's a while away alone (without an adult) to meet an online friend of mine. I know this sounds pretty sketchy but for some background I will include the following paragraph.

I met him online playing video games. We ended up talking and what not. We've been talking for a couple months now. I think of him as my bestest friend, someone closer then all of my other friends. We both really want to meet each other. He's a minor like myself and our age difference is very small. I know for a fact that he is a minor, not some older man pretending to be a teenager. The reason we haven't meet up is because of the large distance between us.

So that's the background. I already accounted for the cost of plane tickets, baggage, someone to go with, and a public place to meet. I will be paying for the whole trip for myself and my friend so my mother won't have to spend a penny on it. We're only going over for a day, and we (my friend and I) will be missing one or two days of school. We would go late one night so we'd get there in the morning then leave that day. We will be meeting at a very public place with tons of people. He might be bringing male friends as well. 

Just for the record because I feel like this will go along with what my mother will say, I am a responsible person. I act mature, never get in trouble, get good grades, ect. So if that helps any it's there. 

Also an extra question that I haven't quite thought out. My friend and I are legally allowed to fly alone but need a guardians signature. How would I do that on a round trip?

Any help would be appreciated. Thank you.
