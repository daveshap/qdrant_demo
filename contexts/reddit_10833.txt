My boyfriend killed himself a week ago
And I really want to do the same. It hurts so much to miss him every second of every day. We were a good couple, with so much love for each other. We were each other’s everything. Whenever I had anxiety or was simply sad, the only thing that helped was his hugs and kisses. Now he’s not here anymore, he’s just ashes.

My friends got worried about me and got me committed against my will at a short term mental hospital and I just got out today, 12 days after his death.

I miss him with every fibre and molecule and atom of my being. It’s physically painful, insufferable. I can’t think about anything else.

I tried overdosing on Xanax with alcohol but I didn’t have enough, and when I woke up the next day I was so disappointed. This was before the hospitalisation. During the hospitalisation I was ok, better than now. But I don’t want to go back there, the place was awful.

The only reason I’m not attempting a new OD this very second is that it would kill (figuratively) my parents. Everyone would be sad. And I can’t do that to them. But at the same time, my love is never coming back and he’s all I want. All I need. NEED with every cell in my body. It physically hurts.

I wish I could disappear from their memories and just die and nobody would be sad. Because I can’t take it anymore. The grief is too big, too hard. What can I do to make it okay for everyone?
