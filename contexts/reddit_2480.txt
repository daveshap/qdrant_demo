Does HR suck at every company in the world?
Long story but ill try to keep it short; i got a great job at offer with shorter hours at a different firm in September. After some negotiations I decided to take the job and quit, since I really hated my old job. I was supposed to start my new job in late October/early November, but their HR keeps asking for a whole set of different paperwork every time they contact me; last email was last week after i signed disclosures regarding the position, but nothing like a binding contract. I spoke to HR and they said that my whole package has to go to their panel or something for final approval, which no one told me about before. The offer they gave me had every detail about the job with benefits and they asked me to start the process of quitting my job, which i did. Now, i feel like I’m being gaslighted and just confused with the process because it’s taking so long and they’re being a bit dodgy about the whole thing. 
Any insight on this? Or advice? Im just stressing out over here
