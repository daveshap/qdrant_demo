[META] r/NeutralPolitics feedback and info post in honor of our birthday
r/NeutralPolitics turns 8 years old today! Thank you to everyone who participates in making this a place where differing opinions can come together and rationally discuss political issues. It's been quite a ride so far and promises to be a very interesting year. 

We're using this occasion to ask for some general feedback on how you all think it's going and what could be improved. But first, a few bits of information:

* We need more rules-compliant submissions. This subreddit runs on user-generated content and we're just not getting enough of it to keep things active. We get about 4 or 5 user submissions per day, but most don't comply with our submission rules.  If you have an idea for a post and aren't sure about the rules, ask us for help and we can help make sure it works. [Here's a post from last years with tips on how to get your submission approved.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/aq73o3/meta_how_to_write_a_successful_submission_for/)
* We sometimes get asked what "neutral" means with respect to this subreddit and how it plays into our moderation. This is covered in the [guidelines,](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_neutral-ness) but basically, we moderate by the rules, not by personal opinion. We don't remove content because either we or you don't like it. Submissions must be framed in a neutral way, per Rule B, but **there is no neutrality requirement for comments.** Participating in the comments does not require you to be neutral. It requires you to be factual and respectful. The [four rules on commenting](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_comment_rules) are what apply and we remove content that violates them.
* Our companion news subreddit, r/NeutralNews, is not dead. The reboot has taken a lot longer than we expected, but we've just begun testing our new moderation tools there, so we are making progress.


OK, that's it for the info. Feel free to comment below with things you like, things you dislike, features you'd like to see, etcetera.
