LILY: Doc...
MUMFORD: Lily.
LILY: Doc.
LILY: I don't want you to be mad at Skip...
MUMFORD: He told you.
LILY: Skip and I wouldn't have got together if it weren't for you. That's a big deal.
MUMFORD: You would have met in some shower eventually...
LILY: I want to give you something. Will you let me?
MUMFORD: Thanks, Lily, I don't need anything.
LILY: Yes, you do, you damn well do.
MUMFORD: Okay.
LILY: Here it is, some advice -- do the hard thing.
MUMFORD: That's it? That's what you're giving me?
LILY: Clean up the mess. No matter what it takes.
MUMFORD: What it might take is... doing time.
LILY: Too bad. That's tough, I mean it. I'm not unsympathetic. But Skip says you're in love.
