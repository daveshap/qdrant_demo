My employee offered more to stay than I make, is it time to ask for a raise or a new job?
So I'm in an awkward situation where I'm not sure how to respond. I am a lead engineer and have only one employee working for me who has been there for less than a year. He put in his two weeks notice and I have fought to get him an offer to stay because we are buried in work. The offer hr made him is more than I make by a significant amount. I don't know if they realized that it was more than they are paying me as all the hr is new there.

I have been in my company for 5 years and have really gone above and beyond this past year to make big things happen for them. I have worked weekends, holidays, and vacation days to make all this happen. My division's sales have quadrupled as a direct result of the projects I have done and is growing to upwards of 100 million revenue over the next year. 

The projects I have pulled off were done on a timeline we had never previously achieved in my company and have solidified a new relationships with THE biggest customer in our market. 

I got my lead position in november. The offer was a little under what I told myself I would accept, but I took it anyways because I wanted the management opportunity. Glass door says that I am in the bottom 10th percentile of earners in my area with my job title. 

My company has taken a huge change in direction recently (shortcuts), and we are loosing people right and left because of the highly stressful environment this creates.

What in the world should I do? Ask for a raise? Look for a new job? Hang in there until I have been in my new management position for long enough to get another job like this elsewhere? 

Thanks.
