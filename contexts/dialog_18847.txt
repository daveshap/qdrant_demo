NURSE RANDALL: So you fill it with water like this, and what have you got? A water gun.
THOMAS J: Cool, can I get one for Vada?
NURSE RANDALL: Oh yes, yes.
THOMAS J: Cause she's dying.
NURSE RANDALL: Do you think she is?
THOMAS J: No.
NURSE RANDALL: Why do you think she says that?
THOMAS J: Cause she gets scared of all those dead people in her house, and you know that saying, If you can't beat 'em, join 'em, well if she's one of them, she won't be as scared.
NURSE RANDALL: You know what I think? I think Vada's very lucky to have a friend like you.
