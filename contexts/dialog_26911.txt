REESE: Most official records were lost in the war. The computer knew almost nothing about Connor's mother. Her name. Where she lived, just the city. No scanner pictures. The Terminator was just being systematic.
REESE: You've heard enough. Decide. Are you going to release me?
SILBERMAN: I'm afraid that's not up to me.
REESE: Then why am I talking to you? Get out.
SILBERMAN: I can help you...
REESE: Who is in authority here?
