SISSY: Is everything getting worse?
CHINK: Yes, everything is getting worse. But everything is also getting better.
SISSY: The Countess has come to our aid. The Rubber Rose Ranch is officially deeded to all the cowgirls. And I have been asked to oversee the ranch. For $300 a week. And as it turns out, the Countess is not going to be the vegetable the doctors thought he was... here's a picture!
CHINK: I want to go back to the Clock People. I kind of miss those fool redskins and wonder what they're up to. What's happened to Jelly?
SISSY: She had a one way-ticket to Kansas City.
CHINK: You mean she's dead?
SISSY: But that's an old story now...... I can't believe that you would leave the Butte.
CHINK: Easy come, easy go.
