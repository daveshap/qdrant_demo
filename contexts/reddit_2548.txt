How long did you spend at a job you hate?
Long story short, I’ve been with my current company for coming up 2 years. My first job out of college and it’s a great job, pays well, great benefits etc. But there’s one huge problem which is I absolutely hate it and have felt this way for months. I desperately want a change and I’d like to do entirely different work from what I’m doing now. Problem is it’s been hard to find something I ACTUALLY want to do so I’m not in this same position after a year, so anybody ever been through something similar as this? How did you go about navigating through this time?
