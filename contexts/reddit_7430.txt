Planning my PhD
Hi folks, I started my Ph.D. in Robotics today, refer to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/gjs062/graduated_my_masters_and_phd_starts_early/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) for context. I am trying to figure out a way to plan out the next 4 years of my Ph.D. with the classes I want to take, my quals, paper publishing milestones, etc. I have seen someone do this with a Gantt chart before. Does anyone else have other ideas, or are Gantt charts the way to go for this? Anyone have any suggestions for templates to go off of? Or things that I should remember to include in the plan?

Thanks in advance!
