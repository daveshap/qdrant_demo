JACK: It's bluebells!
GUMP: What!
JACK: The flower. Bluebells. To hear them ringing means your life's at an end.
GUMP: Damnation! Codfish and cockles! Gammon and trotters! You've bested me, Jack.
JACK: A riddle without an answer is but an empty cup when you're thirsty for wine.
GUMP: Well spoke. True to the mark. And if it's wine you're wanting, it's wine we shall have.
GUMP: You be our guest, Jack.
JACK: I'm honored, Honeythorn Gump... but no more tricks.
GUMP: You have me word, lad. To answer a faerie riddle deserves as much.
JACK: Twas the Princess Lili gave me the answer... have you seen her, by chance?
GUMP: I've laid eyes on no mortal but you this day, Jack.
JACK: I fear she's lost.
GUMP: Mayhap you be the one what's lost, and she safe by the castle hearth... but, come Jack, we'll warm your bones.
