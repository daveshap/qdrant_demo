Ethics of requiring art students to use departmental printer
Hey,

I was wondering what you guys thought of a policy my friend is dealing with in her department. She tells me that she is in a class that requires the students use the departmental printer for all of their design drafts and final submissions. The refusal to do so will result in the reduction of her grade. Keep in mind that each 8.5x11 PAGE printed on this printer costs $4. So, if she can get equal quality printing done for less money elsewhere she is not allowed to with this policy. 

Is this ethical? Can the professor enforce this?
