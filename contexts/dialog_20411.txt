FOLEY: You like bourbon?
KAREN: Love it.
FOLEY: Well, we got that out of the way. Tell me, Celeste. What do you do for a living?
KAREN: I'm a sales rep. I came here to call on a customer and they gave me a hard time because I'm a girl.
FOLEY: Is that how you think of yourself?
KAREN: What, as a sales rep?
FOLEY: A girl.
KAREN: I don't have a problem with it.
FOLEY: I like your hair. And that suit.
KAREN: I had one just like it -- well, it was the same idea, but I had to get rid of it.
FOLEY: You did?
KAREN: It smelled.
FOLEY: Having it cleaned didn't help, huh?
KAREN: No. What do you do for a living, Gary?
FOLEY: How far do we go with this?
KAREN: Not yet. Don't say anything yet. Okay?
FOLEY: I don't think it works if we're somebody else. You know what I mean? Gary and Celeste, Jesus, what do they know about anything?
KAREN: It's your game. I've never played this before.
FOLEY: It's not a game. Something you play.
KAREN: Well, does it make sense to you?
FOLEY: It doesn't have to, it's something that happens. It's like seeing a person you never saw before -- you could be passing on the street -- you look at each other and for a few seconds, there's a kind of recognition. Like you both know something. But then the next moment the person's gone, and it's too late to do anything about it, but you remember it because it was right there and you let it go, and you think, What if I had stopped and said something?" It might happen only a few times in your life."
KAREN: Or once.
