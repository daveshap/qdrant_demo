COHAAGEN: What the fuck is going on down there?!
RICHTER: I'm trying to neutralize a traitor.
COHAAGEN: If I wanted him dead, you moron, I wouldn't have dumped him on Earth.
RICHTER: We can't let him run around. He knows too much.
COHAAGEN: Lori says he can't remember jack shit!
RICHTER: That's now. In an hour, he could have total recall.
COHAAGEN: Listen to me, Richter, I want Quaid delivered alive for re-implantation. Have you got that? I want him back in place with Lori.
