I love seeing my friends fall in love with their college decisions
One of my closest friends just committed to Stanford, her very last acceptance after a slew of unexpected rejections. One of my best friends is attending Loyola Marymount for film, one of the best film programs in the country. Another one of my best friends had to pick between USC and in-state U of A and fell in love with U of A and its unique physiology major. Several of my other friends are going to ASU’s Barrett Honors College and pursuing amazing things like Economics with a focus on Public Policy and premed and engineering and interior design and psychology. Two of my closest friends visited and committed to Utah State because of the amazing environmental studies program they have up there. We had some impressive acceptances as an entire class as well - MIT, Yale, Harvard, Rice, Duke, Cornell, Brown, Vanderbilt, WashU, NYU, UCLA, Berkeley, UChicago, Williams. A ton more from smaller name colleges with just as rewarding and exciting academic, professional, and personal prospects for the future. 

Yeah, I’m ecstatic for my future college experience. But it excites me so much to see my friends and peers fall in love with their futures and make these huge, inspiring decisions. I’m so lucky to know such talented, kind, and energizing people. I absolutely can’t wait to see the things they do in the future. I’m fueled by their success. I’m so happy for them, and it’s such a privilege to be able to ride out this crazy college admissions and decisions journey together.
