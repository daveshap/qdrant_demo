How do you respond when a recruiter asks you how much you make at your current position?
I'm in a situation currently where I am underpaid at my position- I'm paid embarassingly under the average (15-20%) and I know I won't get an appropriate raise from my company (already tried). Had a recruiter ask me my current salary and it made me realize it would probably work against me in trying to get better pay. How do you respond to that question?
