STEPHEN: It doesn't go like that.
BRIAN: Who asked you?
STEPHEN: If you do it like that it'll open in the fire. Then you'll get burned and DIE.

STEPHEN: Brian. He's not doing it right, dad. He never does it right.
DENNIS: Well, let's have a look.
DENNIS: Your brother's right. If you don't fasten these correctly they could open and you'd get burned.
STEPHEN: And DIE!
