DAY-DAY: Today ain't my day.
ROACH: Bummer, huh? And Friday is suppose to be a kick-ass day.
CRAIG: Yeah it is...the best day before the weekend.
ROACH: That's fuckin' poetic, Craig.
CRAIG: What's the green stuff poking out?
ROACH: That's cron-don, sir. My mom hates for me to smoke, so she made me bud-brownies. Wanna bite?
CRAIG: Naw, I already ate.
ROACH: Come on, Day, try it. For moms.
