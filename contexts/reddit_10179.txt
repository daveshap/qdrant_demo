I hate how your brain teases you with random moments of motivation/hope/joy/etc. then plunges you back into feeling like subhuman trash for days or weeks on end
I feel like I have nothing worth living for, my music sucks ass, which is the only thing I care about. I'm very grateful my parents care about me but I feel like this isn't getting better no matter how much I've tried. My therapist appointment is so far away even though its only thursday. I've tried holding on, but for some reason it just gets worse.

edit: dumbass spelling error
