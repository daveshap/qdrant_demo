TELLY: You know what else?
CASPER: What?
TELLY: I can tell that she had just entered puberty.
CASPER: How?
TELLY: Well, I was flipping through a picture book of her and her family, right.
CASPER: Right.
TELLY: And there was this picture of her painting Easter eggs or something. And I said, you were cute when you were little.
CASPER: Yeah.
TELLY: And she goes, yeah that picture was taken less than a year ago. I look younger without my makeup.
TELLY: And I looked at her, and thought to myself Oh my god, this girl is a baby.
CASPER: Yeah.
TELLY: And for a second I felt a little bit guilty. You know, because she's young and all. And then I was like, oh shit, that turns me on. I wanna fuck this little baby girl.
