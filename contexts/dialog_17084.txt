GRAHAM: Can you read it to me?
DR. CHILTON: It's written on toilet tissue. 'My dear Dr. Lecktor, I wanted to tell you I'm delighted that you've taken an interest in me. I know that you alone can understand what I'm becoming. 'I know you alone understand the reality of the people who die to help me in these things, understand that they are only elements undergoing change to fuel the radiance of what I am becoming. Just as the source of light is burning. Mr. Graham, there's a hole torn and punched out, then it says... 'I have a complete collection of your press notices. I think of them as unfair. As unfair as mine. The Tooth Fairy." What could be more inappropriate. Investigator Graham interests me. Very purposeful looking. I hope we can correspond. There's another piece missing here. I'll read the bottom part. 'After I hear back from you
CRAWFORD: Sarah, order a chopper. I want the next thing smoking and I don't care whose. Ours. DCPD. Or the Marines. Then call Documents. Tell them to scramble a team. I want everybody moving in five minutes. Dr. Chilton, please do not handle the note. I have a Documents team on the way to you by helicopter to pick it up.
GRAHAM: After we've worked the note we want to replace it in Lecktor's cell. I don't want him to know we found it. Where's Lector now?
DR. CHILTON: In a holding cell.
GRAHAM: How long can you keep Lecktor out without him getting suspicious?
DR. CHILTON: Three, four hours.
