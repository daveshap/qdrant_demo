Non-static spherical symmetry spacetime The Schwarzschild solution is a static spherically symmetric metric. But I wanted to know that how would the space-time interval look in a Non-Static case. I tried to work it out and got $$ds\u00b2= Bdt\u00b2 - Cdtdr - Adr\u00b2 - r\u00b2d\u03a9\u00b2$$Where $A,B,C$ are functions if $r$ and $t$. Being an amateur I am not sure whether this is correct.
