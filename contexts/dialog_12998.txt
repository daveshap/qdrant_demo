PAUL: Canadian Club?
PAUL: Congratulations, Colonel. You have saved us all.
COLONEL OLIVER: Congratulations. You should spit in my face.
PAUL: Excuse me, Colonel.
COLONEL OLIVER: We think you are dirt, less than dirt, worthless.
PAUL: I don't understand.
COLONEL OLIVER: Don't bullshit me, Paul. You're the smartest man here. You have them all eating out of your hand. You'd own this fucking hotel, except for one thing.
COLONEL OLIVER: You're fucking black! You're not even a nigger, you're African! They're not staying to stop this thing. They're gonna fly right out of here with their people.
PAUL: Their people?
COLONEL OLIVER: They're only taking the whites.
