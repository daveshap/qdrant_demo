Salary Negotiations in a Recession
I am almost to the point of getting a new job in a technical quality management possession in a pretty recession proof industry. I'm a bit confused as how to go about salary negotiations due to the current economic climate. Many experts are saying that the COVID-19 Pandemic could likely onset the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression.

I'm unemployed and I'm don't want to risk giving a salary range that will make them rescind their offer. Plus, I imagine there are a lot more options in the market now to get this type of job as more and more people lose their jobs. I'm wondering if I should even bother trying to negotiate up (salaries that would be seen in a healthy/stable economic situation) or just take whatever offer they give me so I at least have a job? Any insight?
