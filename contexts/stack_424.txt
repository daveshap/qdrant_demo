Ubuntu 16.04 setup crashed, stuck in temporary guest session I just got my hands on a Dell XPS13 developer edition machine with Ubuntu 16.04 pre-installed.Once I turned it on the first time, setup started. I reached the wireless step, entered my WIFI key, and it crashed abruptly. It then started a temporary guest session to \"allow me to fix the problem(s)\". But now I am stuck in this temporary guest session and I am no able to do anything:I have no root privilegescannot create usersif I reboot, I get back hereAny idea how to get back to the setup or to fix this? Thanks! :DUPDATE: I have been chatting for one hour with the Dell support and, after trying a number of procedures, they directed me towards a clean install with the latest Ubuntu image (after installing with their factory image failed...). I am now trying to re-install the system without erasing it first. If that does not work I will erase and install a clean Ubuntu 16.04 copy. I have been assured by the support that doing this does not infringe any warranty terms. :)
