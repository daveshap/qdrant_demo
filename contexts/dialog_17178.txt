MARTY: What?
MRS. PILLETTI: I say, why don't you go to the Stardust Ballroom? It's loaded with tomatoes.
MARTY: It's loaded with what?
MRS. PILLETTI: Tomatoes.
MARTY: Ha! Who told you about the Stardust Ballroom?
MRS. PILLETTI: Thomas. He told me it was a very nice place.
MARTY: Oh, Thomas. Ma, it's just a big dance hall, and that's all it is. I been there a hundred times. Loaded with tomatoes. Boy, you're funny, Ma.
MRS. PILLETTI: Marty, I don't want you hang arounna house tonight. I want you to go take a shave and go out and dance.
MARTY: Ma, when are you gonna give up? You gotta bachelor on your hands. I ain't never gonna get married.
MRS. PILLETTI: You gonna get married.
MARTY: Sooner or later, there comes a point in a man's life when he gotta face some facts, and one fact I gotta face is that whatever it is that women like, I ain't got it. I chased enough girls in my life. I went to enough dances. I got hurt enough. I don't wanna get hurt no more. I just called a girl just now, and I got a real brush-off, boy. I figured I was past the point of being hurt, but that hurt. Some stupid woman who I didn't even wanna call up. She gave me the brush. I don't wanna go to the Stardust Ballroom because all that ever happened to me there was girls made me feel like I was a bug. I got feelings, you know. I had enough pain. No, thank you.
MRS. PILLETTI: Marty...
MARTY: Ma, I'm gonna stay home and watch Jackie Gleason.
MRS. PILLETTI: You gonna die without a son.
MARTY: So I'll die without a son.
MRS. PILLETTI: Put on your blue suit...
MARTY: Blue suit, gray suit, I'm still a fat man. A fat ugly man.
MRS. PILLETTI: You not ugly.
MARTY: I'm ugly... I'm ugly! I'm UGLY!
MRS. PILLETTI: Marty...
MARTY: Ma! Leave me alone!
