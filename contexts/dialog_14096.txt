OLIVER: It doesn't look much like the fish spears I knew back in Marblehead..
ALBRECHT: Our friend, Poseidon, didn't use it for fishing. He raked the sea with it and stirred up the big waves.
OLIVER: I'll go up and take a look at the General —- perhaps sit with him.
ALBRECHT: He won't even know you're there. He is delirious.
OLIVER: All the more reason to watch him. He's had some wild notions lately.
ALBRECHT: Don't bother. Go to bed and get some sleep. I'll be working late. I can hear any movement down here.
OLIVER: Well ——
ALBRECHT: Go ahead. I'll wake you up when I go to bed. Then you can watch him.
OLIVER: Thank you, I'll do that. Good night.
THEA: You should sleep, Cathy. Lie down and close your eyes. Try to forget everything.
CATHY: When I close my eyes, I see Miss Wollsten. I can't think of anything else.
THEA: She is dead — at peace.
CATHY: Suppose, she isn't dead. Suppose it was a cataleptic attack?
THEA: It was, the plague
CATHY: We quarreled. She never dared get angry or frightened -- but I said things to her -- it was an attack, I know it was.
