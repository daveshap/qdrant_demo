App in background I have an iPhone 5C, running an app that is connected to a Bluetooth device. When the connection to the Bluetooth device is lost (spreading apart, Bluetooth turned off etc.) the app sounds a buzzer. From what I\u00b4ve read, specific apps are allowed to run in the background, and some of them communicate with Bluetooth devices. For this particular app, that is true almost all the time.The problem happens when I browse in the Web. Sometimes the app gets killed and the buzzer sounds. I am sure it gets killed because when I tap on the app in the multi-tasking UI, it reopens. When I tap on the app while running, it shows the Bluetooth device connected. Is there a way to prevent the app from getting killed?The App is Itrack Easy and the device is a Bluetooth button. I am testing this App because I intend to use this device as a panic button connected to the phone with my own App. My problem is not that hear the buzzer or not. My problem is that if this test App gets killed, mine will too and the button will not work as a panic device, available when the phone is near.
