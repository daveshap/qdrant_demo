Is it possible to serve vector tiles directly from S3? I have seen that it is possible to use S3 as a storage backend for vector tile servers such as Tegola. These work by fetching the tile from S3, then serving it through an application server.Is there any possible mechanism by which tiles would be fetched directly from S3 in the browser? Having a massively scalable infrastructure like S3 piped through a tiny server seems like a bottleneck to be avoided.
