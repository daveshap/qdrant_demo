Can the modal 'must' be used in the apodosis of a remote conditional? CGEL* has this on page 149:<blockquote>  The open conditional is the default type, while remote conditionals have the following properties:    [3] i Subordinate clause: must contain a preterite (or irrealis were) expressing modal remoteness.    ii Matrix clause: must contain a modal auxiliary, in the preterite if possible.[Footnote]    Footnote:  \u2018If possible\u2019 in [ii] allows for the occurrence in the present tense of those modals like must which have no preterite form (cf. \u00a76.2.1).</blockquote>In CGEL's terminology, an \"open conditional\" refers to a conditional construction (If P, then Q) where P and Q are presented as an open possibility; a \"remote conditional\" refers to a conditional construction where P and Q are presented as a remote possibility.What CGEL says above is, in \"If P, then Q\" in a \"remote conditional\" type, Q can contain the modal must.But I can't seem to find a remote conditional example where Q has the modal must.Unfortunately, CGEL's \u00a76.2.1 fails to show any example of a remote conditional whose Q contains the modal must.Can anyone think of a remote conditional example whose Q contains the modal must?*The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language
