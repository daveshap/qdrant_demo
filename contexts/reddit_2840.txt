Never worked, in my 40s, what do I do? Please help, any advice is welcome.
I need some "get real" advice.

I'm slowly emerging from a lifelong crippling clinical depression & anxiety disorder. I hope I will soon be healthy enough to work at least part-time. I'm in my 40s, have only a high-school diploma, never worked but have financial support, no children.

What do I do now? what realistic goals should I aim for? educate myself (apprenticeship? University? on the job training?)? does it even make sense to go to uni and risk finding no jobs afterwards because too old? shouldn't I just aim for unskilled jobs until I retire? What should I be thinking or worrying about? 

All and any advice is welcome.

edit: Thanks for your input, below some more information about me.

~~My interests:~~ I am attracted to those fields and activities:

Nature, forests, mountains, sea, lake, animals, growing vegetables, agriculture, fishing, boats, biology & biochemistry, physics, math & statistics, trains & railroads, cooking, bio & food technology, movies (scifi, thriller, spy movies, political/lawyer movies, stand-up comedies), learning new languages, traveling, journalism, religions & traditions, history, culture in general, working with wood, building stuff, repairing bikes, 

As a kid, I remember feeling happy in farms, mountains, forests, workshops, museums, boats, vegetable gardens, camping, swimming, ... 

**edit2:**

Wow, I can't thank you enough for all of your advice. I'm looking for volunteer work as a gentle introduction to work, but also to explore my health limits, my capacity/potential, my interests, different organizations & work environments that I find attractive, while still helping. That's a good idea. Thanks u/TheGingerHutchy! 

After a few months, If okay, I'm thinking of going to trade school (no college/university).

Any and all advice are still welcome, I'm still reading your comments gals and guys. 

**Thanks for your support!**
