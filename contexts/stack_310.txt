I bought a 'new' MacBook Pro from 3rd party. It came in a refurbished box, but they insist it was 'new' How do I know if this really is new or used? When I received the MacBook, it was in a 2016 refurbished apple MacBook Pro box even though the MacBook I received is a 2017 version. Are there any options that I have, to confirm whether this is a new or refurbished Mac?I saw online that I can ask Apple to check the serial number and see if its ever been registered with someone else other than me. Will that work? Can I go to the Apple store and ask them to verify it for me? Other than that, I received the MacBook exactly as I bought it; exact specs. I just thought that maybe they took the MacBook out of the original boxing and put it in a older box, but why would they do that, and why would they use an older box? Please help me out. Edit: I checked the battery cycle, and its at 4. Is that substantial? (Do new Macs come with a battery cycle like that?)Just for reference, I bought this from Other World Computing.
