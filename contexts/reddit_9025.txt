Should social security be privatized?
Occasionally I here about certain politicians planning to privatize social security (mostly from opponents of said politicians, but I digress). As is, social security will run out of money and have to cut benefits in 2030. (source: https://www.cbo.gov/publication/52298).

Could privatisation prevent this? What would privatisation detail? What alternatives are there?
