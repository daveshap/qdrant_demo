Laid off then rescinded without any discussion with HR or manager - what should i do?
May 26th - I was notified through my manager that I am being laid off from the company that I work at (large tech fortune 500 company) due to covid. They gave me one month notice and the final day of work was supposed to be June 24th. Severance package was going to be couple of months worth of salary.

June 12th - This is 2 weeks before my final day. I got an email saying that my separation from the company had been rescinded. Meaning, they were no longer laying me off. I had no prior conversation with my manager or HR regarding this happening. They just notified me without even speaking to me or any discussions.

Now, I have no severance package, but still have my job. I guess most people will look at this as a good thing but I was never really happy working at this company and had accepted the layoff and was moving on looking for new opportunities in this tough market.

I'm pretty upset that they are toying with my emotions and laying me off/bringing me back as they feel. I was happy about dropping all the BS work/stressload I had at the company. And then now I have to go back.

Is it just me, or is it messed up for the company to do that? What if I had gotten an offer from another company, and all I had was the choice was to move on without a severance. That's such BS.

What would you guys do, stay at the company or fight to get the severance package and be laid off?
