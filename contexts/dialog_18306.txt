DENNIS: You didn't bother to find out, did you?
ARTHUR: I've said I'm sorry about the old woman, but from the behind you looked ...
DENNIS: What I object to is that you automatically treat me like an inferior ...
ARTHUR: Well ... I AM king.
DENNIS: Oh, very nice. King, eh! I expect you've got a palace and fine clothes and courtiers and plenty of food. And how d'you get that? By exploiting the workers! By hanging on to outdated imperialist dogma which perpetuates the social and economic differences in our society! If there's EVER going to be any progress ...
OLD WOMAN: Dennis! There's some lovely filth down here ... Oh! how d'you do?
ARTHUR: How d'you do, good lady ... I am Arthur, King of the Britons ... can you tell me who lives in that castle?
OLD WOMAN: King of the WHO?
ARTHUR: The Britons.
OLD WOMAN: Who are the Britons?
ARTHUR: All of us are ... we are all Britons.
