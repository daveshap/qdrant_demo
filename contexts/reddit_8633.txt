How do laws requiring the phrase "In God we trust" to be displayed in public schools interact with the establishment clause of the constitution?
This upcoming school year, three states in the US ([Louisiana](https://abcnews.go.com/US/louisiana-public-schools-display-god-trust-beginning-school/story?id=64947756&cid=clicksource_81_null_articleroll_hed&fbclid=IwAR3RNoEI5gs2ssdVwQKq5kG2ReHry-K3drzP-NE6GYtxklO4SdOUy9z7AP8), [South Dakota](https://preview.abcnews.go.com/US/south-dakota-public-schools-now-required-display-god/story?id=64587406), and [Kentucky](https://apps.legislature.ky.gov/record/19rs/hb46.html)) will require the phrase "in God we trust" to be displayed in public schools. That phrase has been the [US national motto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_motto) since 1956 and first appeared on coins in 1864.

How do those new laws, and in a broader sense the national motto, interact with the [establishment clause](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment) of the first amendment?

From the [Cornell law school](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/establishment_clause):

>The First Amendment's  Establishment Clause prohibits the government from making any law  “respecting an establishment of religion.” This clause not only forbids  the government from establishing an official religion, but also  prohibits government actions that unduly favor one religion over another. It also prohibits the government from unduly preferring  religion over non-religion, or non-religion over religion.
