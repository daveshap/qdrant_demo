Correct term to describe apparent bias in expressing opinions -- extremity as a function of publicity I am looking for the proper term to describe the apparent bias that exists in voicing one's opinion. Here are two ways I currently conceptualize this bias:the content of the comparatively more outspoken individuals are moreopinionated/extremethe more public/widespread a message is, the more opinionated/extremeit tends to be.There is a bit of nuance that sets the above explanations apart, but they loosely govern the same principal. Principal may even be a bit of a strong word, I admit, it's almost akin to a generalization. Nonetheless, there are certainly some sociological/psychological mechanisms at work, so my hope is that there is an existing term for this. It might be helpful to include a quick example/anecdote:Example 1: When one looks at graffiti messages on walls, they tend to make a distinct stance on something. It would be much more likely to see \"Chuck Norris is awesome!\" or \"Chuck Norris is stupid!\" written on a wall than it would be to see \"Chuck Norris is so-so.\" Bear in mind I'm not grappling with causality or anything, merely correlation. It could very well be that more opinionated messages are more entertaining, sell more views, or what have you. I simply wish to find the proper term for this phenomenon or have the phrase I coined criticized. OptionalIf there is truly no existing term for this bias, I would like to include an optional section for addressing the term I coined for it, which is: \"Extrema Bias\". It has a nice ring to it, I'm not sure if the etymology is justified by the word roots though.
