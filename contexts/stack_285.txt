Mac after reboot only allows one account to logon Afternoons all,So I have a MacBook Pro, 2018 TB with High Sierra that's bound to a Windows domain, built via JAMF.We have one admin account on the machine which our IT team use then the user account where they themselves are also admins. I should point out I have admin rights on the machine.Nothing special about these accounts as far as I'm aware.However when my user logs onto the machine, to do their work and then reboots, at logon they are only prompted for the password for the IT admin account. They don't see the username and password fields.I'm trying to go through the console logs but unsure what I'm even looking for.I should have mentioned, I have admin rights but some features are locked down via JAMF security profiles.Anyone else seen this issue?
