DOCTOR: Who are you? Doctor Adams was supposed to assist me.
BONES: We're just -- observing.
DOCTOR: I was not informed about observers.
DOCTOR: What the hell do you think you're doing?
BONES: Reading the patient's vital signs.
KIRK: An experimental device, doctor.
BONES: Tearing of the middle meningeal artery...
DOCTOR: What's your degree in, dentistry?
BONES: How do you explain slowing pulse, low respiratory rate and coma?
DOCTOR: Fundoscopic examination --
BONES: Fundoscopic examination is unrevealing in these cases!
DOCTOR: A simple evacuation of the expanding epidural hematoma will relieve the pressure.
BONES: My God, man, drilling holes in his head is not the answer. The artery must be repaired without delay or he will die! So put away your butcher knives and let me save the patient!
