Cheating on a test?
An instructor hands out a take-home exam and claims that the text is open-book and open-internet (the only rule is no communicating with others students).  The take-home exam has problems found in various textbooks, all with searchable solutions online.  Is it cheating to look at those solutions?  Does open-internet mean anything you find on the internet?
