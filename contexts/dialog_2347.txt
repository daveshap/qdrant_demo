LANDON: Like in a church painting. I see this giant hovering over the ground. He's wearing a robe, and has long flowing hair, and he's pointing his finger at something.
JAMIE: Do you ever wonder why things happen the way they do?
LANDON: No.
JAMIE: I know there's a plan for everyone, but sometimes I don't understand what the message is -- or what the point is.
LANDON: There is no point. You live. You die. The end.
LANDON: You have to believe to have faith.
JAMIE: You don't believe in anything?
LANDON: The Bible. Why should I read a bunch of dumb stories about some ancient guy who supposedly worked miracles.
JAMIE: Interpreted by another guy like my father.
LANDON: Your father doesn't like me.
JAMIE: He doesn't trust you.
LANDON: Sometimes I don't even trust me.
