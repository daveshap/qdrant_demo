LEE: Carter, get off that stage!
CARTER: Are you kidding, they love me. I'm a star, Lee. A god to these people!
LEE: This is a gangster bar, we're here undercover.
CARTER: I knew you were lying.
LEE: I'm sorry.
CARTER: Damn it, why are you ruining my night? I'm just starting to have fun. Well fine then, go ahead, pull your badge and do your thing.
LEE: No, we're here for information, to find out where a man named Ricky Tan is. We must tread softly and keep our ears open.
CARTER: Tread softly? Who taught you how to roost a bar?
LEE: Carter, you don't understand. These men are Fu-Cang-Long Triads. Part of the most deadly gang in China.
CARTER: Man, are you crazy? You think that scares me? I'm from L.A. We invented gangs. We were having gang wars before anybody even thought about it. We get royalties from other gangs. Now gimme your badge and gun and I'll show you how it's done.
LEE: No. You are a civilian. In China, I am Michael Jackson, and you are Toto.
CARTER: You mean Tito. We had Toto for dinner last night.
