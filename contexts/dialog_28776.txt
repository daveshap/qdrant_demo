THX: Why did you have LUH come here?
SEN: Why are you so concerned?
THX: What's going on?
SEN: I want you for my roommate.
THX: Where's LUH?
SEN: It will be good for both of us. I've got it all arranged.
THX: I don't understand. Living....selection is computed. You can't... What have you done to LUH? She was here..
SEN: We had a long talk and she agreed that it would be a good idea for you to switch. She felt that you had not been accurately mated to her in the first place... You're upsetting yourself. Would you like something?
THX: You're in violation.
SEN: Don't say that. You look... You're not well.
