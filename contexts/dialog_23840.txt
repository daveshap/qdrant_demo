JACK: How about this one? We didn't hit this one.
MILES: Yeah, it's Frass Canyon. It's a joke.
JACK: You ever actually been in there, Miles?
MILES: I don't have to.
JACK: I say we check it out. You never know.
MILES: Tastes like the back of a fucking LA schoolbus. Probably didn't de-stem, hoping for some semblance of concentration, crushed it up with leaves and mice, wound up with this rancid tar and turpentine mouthwash bullshit. Fucking Raid.
JACK: I don't know. Tastes okay to me. Hey, they got a reserve pinot.
MILES: Let me use your phone.
JACK: What's up?
MILES: I can't take it anymore. I've got to call Evelyn.
