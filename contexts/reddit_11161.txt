I'm terrified. COVID-19 is officially at my mom's work. My dad isn't healthy.
My mom works in an ER in a major metropolitan area that has the busiest airport in the world.

She text me this morning that they're asking everyone about any respiratory symptoms and checking everyone's temperature before allowing anyone to come inside. When she got to her desk, she found an e-mail from some higher up saying that two patients had tested positive for COVID-19 at her hospital, which is why they're doing this now.

My mom, I'm not worried about. She's a 50s, healthy, adult. She may get sick, but I don't foresee her having severe complications. However, my dad is a 50s, unhealthy, obese adult with right side heart failure and lung disease.

My mom is doing everything she can to prevent spreading anything, but you can only do so much. They share a bed, you know?

I'm sick to my stomach about this. Like, can't focus, scared shitless, feeling helpless, and terrified.

Just needed to vent... Thought it'd help me be able to focus on my work if I could get this out.
