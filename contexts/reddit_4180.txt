Worst dates you’ve ever had?
I was talking to this girl for a couple days on Tinder and agreed to go on a date and meet up for coffee. 10 minutes into date her friend comes running up to our table saying she needs to leave immediately because her house was on fire. She immediately got up and left. We were 2 blocks from her house and there was clearly no smoke from a house fire at all. I texted her and called her out on it and she said it was the best way she could think of to get away from me. We had been laughing and having what I thought was an enjoyable 10 minutes prior to this. 

Apparently honesty is a foreign concept for people and they feel easily provable lies are the best option. Definitely the worst and weirdest rejection I’ve ever had. Before this I never thought the whole friend faking an emergency was something people actually did. 

I’m curious what some of the worst dates any of you have had?
