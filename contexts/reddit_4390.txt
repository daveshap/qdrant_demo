I love anime so much it made me do things today
Like, no one asked. I'm an absolutely horrible person and I don't think I even deserve to be alive, but anime... 

Today I felt kinda good. Sports anime are especially motivational for some reason. Seeing the characters so enthusiastic and motivated to achieve something, to keep fighting, laughing and smiling... it made me cry a lot. I felt comforted in some way, because they had failed a lot too. They weren't perfect and made mistakes, lots of them sometimes, but they were still standing up and were able to be happy.

So then I finally found the motivation to get up and have something to eat, shower, and I forced myself to smile. I started to cry again but it felt good.

I feel guilty for feeling good, but maybe if I'm ever able to overcome the past I can be happy too, just like those characters I see on anime. I guess I'll keep fighting. I don't want to be this horrible, it hurts a lot
