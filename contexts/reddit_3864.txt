Women who are in a relationship with someone who puts in less effort than you, why?
not a rhetorical question. I am actually trying to understand the priorities of such a relationship dynamic.

I have friends who are in LTR or are married to men who visibly put in much less effort than the woman is putting. Small things such as deciding where to go on a date or arranging for activities that will make them spend quality time together are done by the woman. She will plan for days and get him an elaborate gift and he will respond with a 'thanks, babe!'. Like that's it? The catch, however, is that they seem quite happy in this dynamic. It seems as if it is expected of her to be putting in more effort than the guy is putting. Is it? These friends btw also think that I expect too much out of the men I am dating. I am wondering if that is true, or if I am chasing something that is ungettable, or if one person in the relationship will always put in less effort and it has got something to do with personality types. I understand that there are differences in love languages but I still would want the guy to show me his emotions as much as I do to him.

(I am not saying this is true for all relationships, I am just talking about a few of my friends here).
