MAX: ... Where did curiosity get the cat?
SELINA: I'm no cat. I'm just an assistant. A <u>secretary</u> --
MAX: And a very, very good one.
SELINA: Too good?
SELINA: It's our secret. Honest. How can you be so mean to someone so meaningless?
MAX: I must protect my interests, Ms. Kyle. And Interest Number One, is <u>moi</u>.
SELINA: Okay, go ahead. Intimidate me, bully me if it makes you feel big. I mean, it's not like you can just kill me.
MAX: Actually, it's a lot like that.
