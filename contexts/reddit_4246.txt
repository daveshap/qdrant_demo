Is anyone else in an isolationship?
Several weeks before the Corona Virus pandemic began, I met a nice girl on OLD. We live about 40 minutes from each other but we work in neighbouring buildings, so organizing a daytime coffee date was easy. We hit it off and planned to go for a walk a few days later. Then we had a real date in her neighborhood on a Friday night which was awesome. It was reciprocated by a date in my neighborhood the following week. We were definitely hitting it off. 

Then..... lockdown. 

Ever since we’ve both been isolated in our homes, we’ve had FaceTime dates every night for hours. We’ve drank entire bottles of wine together and learned a lot about each other. This is a lot like Love is Blind except for the initial dates we had. We are both losing our minds wanting to see each other in person again at this point. I’ve never had an experience like this, but I think it’s a really interesting and healthy way to start a relationship. Time will tell, but damn this is a lot of fun and it’s making the isolation much more bearable. I was thinking, statistically, there must be some other new couples experiencing a similar situation. Anyways, stay safe and don’t be a Covidiot by going out in public!!
