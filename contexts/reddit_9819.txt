College-level instruction while working in higher education?
Hey, I was hoping reddit would be a suitable area to ask this. 

I am an undergraduate student with an intention to go into the higher education field. That being said, I have long enjoyed the concept of teaching at the university level, and am curious as to whether or not working as a higher education professional can provide me with this? I have noticed some of my supervisors have been able to teach basic leadership courses. Simply put, I want to be able to teach on a part-time basis, is this possible/recommended? If anyone has experience or knows anyone who has taught on the side, what was the experience like?

Thank you for anyone who is able to answer this. I very much appreciate it.
