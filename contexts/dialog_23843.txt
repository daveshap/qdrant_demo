JACK: Just write another one. You have lots of ideas, right?
MILES: No, I'm finished. I'm not a writer. I'm a middle-school English teacher. I'm going to spend the rest of my life grading essays and reading the works of others. It's okay. I like books. The world doesn't give a shit what I have to say. I'm unnecessary. I'm so insignificant, I can't even kill myself.
JACK: What's that supposed to mean?
MILES: You know -- Hemingway, Sexton, Woolf, Plath, Delmore Schwartz. You can't kill yourself before you've even been published.
JACK: What about that guy who wrote Confederacy of Dunces? He committed suicide before he got published, and look how famous he is.
MILES: Thanks.
JACK: Don't give up. You're going to make it.
MILES: Half my life is over, and I have nothing to show for it. I'm a thumbprint on the window of a skyscraper. I'm a smudge of excrement on a tissue surging out to sea with a million tons of raw sewage.
JACK: See? Right there. Just what you just said. That's beautiful. A thumbprint on a skyscraper. I couldn't write that.
MILES: Neither could I. I think it's Bukowski.
