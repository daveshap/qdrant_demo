GEORGE: Bob, can't you get them to wait for us? They're leaving us farther behind every day.
CONWAY: There's nothing that would suit them better than to lose us, but we must go on. Come on.
MARIA: No, I can't! I can't! You've got to let me rest! You've got to let me rest!
CONWAY: Hey!
GEORGE: Target practice again! One of these days they're going to hit us.
CONWAY: As long as they keep on aiming at us, we're safe. Come now, child.
