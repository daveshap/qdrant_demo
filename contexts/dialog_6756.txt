MARION: You're my prisoner.
JACK: I've got something to tell you.
MARION: I want to hear it.
JACK: I've got a job.
MARION: What job?
JACK: In a casino. As a croupier. A dealer.
MARION: How did you land that?
JACK: It came my way. 450 a week.
MARION: 450? What did you do, just walked in and said I want to be a croupier? Don't you need training?
JACK: I had training. In the Republic.
MARION: You were a croupier there? You never told me that. I thought you just knew some gamblers.
JACK: I start Monday week.
