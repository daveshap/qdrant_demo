SUSAN: Hey, you should be more careful. That's my ma and pa.
KANE: I'm sorry. They live here, too?
SUSAN: No. They've passed on.
KANE: Where's the soap?
SUSAN: In the water.
KANE: You're very easily amused.
SUSAN: I always like to see the funny side of things. No sense crying when you don't have to. And you're so funny. Looking at you, I forget all about my toothache.
SUSAN: Oh!
KANE: I can't stay here all night chasing your pain away.
SUSAN: I know... But you do look so silly.
KANE: Where's the towel?
SUSAN: On the chiffonier. Here.
KANE: Thanks.
SUSAN: I've got a brush in the closet. As soon as the mud on your trousers is all dry - you just brush it off.
KANE: I'll get these streets fixed, if it's the last thing I do.
