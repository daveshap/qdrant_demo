Chronic yeast infections are ruining my life.
26F here, I just don't know what to do anymore. I've tried everything. I feel like setting myself on fire. My blood work shows everything is fine. Doctors say it seems to be stressed induced. I don't know how to de-stress. I also have dandruff. I want to crawl out of my skin. : ( 
Sorry if this seems choppy, its taken a toll on my mental health as well.
