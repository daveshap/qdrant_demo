Now that I'm losing weight, I no longer love my body like I used to.
My entire life I've been overweight. Now too overweight, but just barely in the unhealthy zone. I can remember being 5 years old and crying to my (crazy) mother about how kids called me fat in Kindergarten, and her response was, "It just means you have a skinny back".

Bullshit of my life story aside, I had to grow up fast, and stand up for myself. And when I did, I became confident in my abilities, in my intelligence, in my personality, in my beliefs/morals. Basically instead of working on losing the weight for other people, I worked on my self confidence. And it worked! I know I'm strong. I know I can hang with the guys, because my size is partially body fat partially muscle. 

But this summer, I started eating healthier out of moralish obligations. No soda, no fried food, more vegetables and fruits and less red meat. I also started going to my friend's bootcamp to support her. On top of it, I'm not participating in Ramadan, and the not eating, but continued work is making me drop inches. I wish I could tell you how many I've dropped, but I don't know the beginning number. I would say maybe 3 or 4 inches.

Here's the thing. Now that I'm smaller, I don't identify with the "Big Momma" trope that I had always aspired to be. The loveable, huggable, tactless maternal figure that you could depend on, and that no one messed with. When I looked in the mirror at my shrunken waist size I didn't feel great. I hadn't worked for anything to achieve that feeling. Instead I felt a little less powerful.

Sure being tinier would be great because of the health benefits but it doesn't feel like me. For 20 years, I've been that overweight loveable, huggable, tact-less girl that you can always depend on. I just don't know what to do with this new body.
