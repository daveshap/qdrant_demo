I'm an introvert and I want to go into politics - am I crazy?
I'm really passionate about a number of social issues and I love debate/public speaking as well. Politics is something I've always been really passionate about but I'm not sure if it's for me.

I'm definetely not shy. I love meeting new people and listening to their ideas. However, once you get to know me I become slightly more quiet and I prefer to listen more than speak. People think of me as a strong leader but when asked whether I am an extrovert or an introvert, they usually respond with introvert. Is that bad? Am I kidding myself by wanting to work in politics?

I'm a high school student and I've been good at STEM for my whole life but its really not what I'm passionate about. Despite winning a number of debate awards and running a successful international NGO, my parents still don't think I'm cut out for public service and they think they should stick with STEM. Are they right?
