HARTMAN: Where'd you get this?
HILDY: I've got a right to carry a gun if I want to.
HARTMAN: Not this gun!
BURNS: I can explain that, Hartman. When Hildy told me she wanted to interview Earl Williams I thought it might be dangerous and I gave her a gun to defend herself.
HARTMAN: Oh, you did! Well, that's very, very interesting. This happens to be the gun that Earl Williams shot his way out with!
