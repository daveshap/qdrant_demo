GEORGE: Whew.
JACKIE: What's wrong?
GEORGE: It's hot in here.
JACKIE: It's the sauna, I keep the sauna on and it makes the whole bathroom hot.
GEORGE: Yeah... wow.
JACKIE: Not too much, don't cut too much.

GEORGE: Why not?
JACKIE: ... he tried to... uh... make it with me.
GEORGE: And?
JACKIE: And what?
GEORGE: Did you?
JACKIE: It was after you, baby. After you.
GEORGE: Boy, that sauna is really... can't you turn it down or something?
JACKIE: No... Lester likes it on all the time in case he wants to use it.
