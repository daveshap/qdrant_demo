BOB: Hello?
LYDIA: Bob?
BOB: Hi, Lydia.
LYDIA: Is this a bad time?
BOB: Uh, no.
LYDIA: It's really hard to reach you... Did you get the carpet samples? I like the burgundy.
BOB: Ok, whatever you think... I'm lost.
LYDIA: It's just carpet.
BOB: That's not what I'm talking about.
LYDIA: What are you talking about?
BOB: I don't know.
LYDIA: Is there anything I can do?
BOB: I don't know... I want to be more healthy. I want to eat better.
LYDIA: What?
BOB: You know, eat healthier.
LYDIA: Alright?
BOB: Not all that pasta.
LYDIA: Fine.
BOB: Like Japanese food.
LYDIA: Why don't you just stay there, and you can have it everyday.
BOB: Oh, come on.
LYDIA: I have to go, Adam's tormenting Zoe, I'll talk to you later. Are you going to be Ok?
BOB: Yeah, I'll be fine. Bye.
