BETSY: No, I don't think so. That's someone else.
TOM: Now look more closely. Look around the eyes and chin. See? See there?
TRAVIS: Are you a Secret Service Man?
SECRET SERVICE MAN: Why do you ask?
TRAVIS: I've seen a lot of suspicious-looking people around here today.
SECRET SERVICE MAN: Who?
TRAVIS: Oh, lots. I don't know where they all are now. There used to be one standing over there.
TRAVIS: Is it hard to get to be a Secret Service Man?
SECRET SERVICE MAN: Why?
TRAVIS: I kinda thought I might make a good one. I'm very observant.
SECRET SERVICE MAN: Oh?
TRAVIS: I was in the Army too. And I'm good with crowds.
SECRET SERVICE MAN: Is that so?
TRAVIS: What kind of guns do you guys use? .38's?
SECRET SERVICE MAN: Look, um, if you give me your name and address, we'll send you the information on how to apply.
TRAVIS: You would, huh?
SECRET SERVICE MAN: Sure.
TRAVIS: My name is Henry Krinkle -- that's with a K." K-R-I-N-K-L-E. I live at 13 1/2 Hopper Avenue
SECRET SERVICE MAN: Sure, Henry. I got it all. We'll send you all the stuff all right.
TRAVIS: Great, hey. Thanks a lot.
