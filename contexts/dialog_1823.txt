SHELDRAKE: How long has it been -- a month?
FRAN: Six weeks. But who's counting?
SHELDRAKE: I missed you, Fran.
FRAN: Like old times. Same booth, same song --
SHELDRAKE: It's been hell.
FRAN: -- same sauce -- sweet and sour.
SHELDRAKE: You don't know what it's like -- standing next to you in that elevator, day after day -- Good morning, Miss Kubelik -- Good night, Mr. Sheldrake -- I'm still crazy about you, Fran.
FRAN: Let's not start on that again, Jeff -- please. I'm just beginning to get over it.
SHELDRAKE: I don't believe you.
FRAN: Look, Jeff -- we had two wonderful months this summer -- and that was it. Happens all the time -- the wife and kids go away to the country, and the boss has a fling with the secretary or the manicurist -- or the elevator girl. Comes September, the picnic is over -- goodbye. The kids go back to school, the boss goes back to the wife, and the girl -- They don't make these shrimp like they used to.
SHELDRAKE: I never said goodbye, Fran.
FRAN: For a while there, you try kidding yourself that you're going with an unmarried man. Then one day he keeps looking at his watch, and asks you if there's any lipstick showing, then rushes off to catch the seven-fourteen to White Plains. So you fix yourself a cup of instant coffee -- and you sit there by yourself -- and you think -- and it all begins to look so ugly --
SHELDRAKE: How do you think I felt -- riding home on that seven-fourteen train?
FRAN: Why do you keep calling me, Jeff? What do you want from me?
SHELDRAKE: I want you back, Fran.
FRAN: Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake -- I'm full up. You'll have to take the next elevator.
SHELDRAKE: You're not giving me a chance, Fran. I asked you to meet me because -- I have something to tell you. FRAN Go ahead -- tell me.
SHELDRAKE: Not here, Fran. Can't we go some place else?
FRAN: No. I have a date at eight-thirty.
SHELDRAKE: Important?
FRAN: Not very -- but I'm going to be there anyway.
