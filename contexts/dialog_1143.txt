SERVANT: Excuse me, sir, there is a lady who insists on talking to you.
SALIERI: Who is she?
SERVANT: She didn't say. But she says it's urgent.
SALIERI: Excuse me, my dear.
CONSTANZE: Excellency!
SALIERI: Madame. How can I help you?
SALIERI: Frau Mozart?
CONSTANZE: That's right, Your Excellency. I've come on behalf of my hus band. I'm - I'm bringing some samples of his work so he can be considered for the royal appointment.
SALIERI: How charming. But why did he not come himself?
CONSTANZE: He's terribly busy, sir.
SALIERI: I understand.
SALIERI: I will look at them, of course, the moment I can. It will be an honour. Please give him my warmest.
CONSTANZE: Would it be too much trouble, sir, to ask you to look at them now? While I wait.
SALIERI: I'm afraid I'm not at leisure this very moment. Just leave them with me. I assure you they will be quite safe.
CONSTANZE: I - I really cannot do that, Your Excellency. You see, he doesn't know I'm here.
SALIERI: Really?
CONSTANZE: My husband is a proud man, sir. He would be furious if he knew I'd come.
SALIERI: Then he didn't send you?
CONSTANZE: No, sir. This is my own idea.
SALIERI: I see.
CONSTANZE: Sir, we really need this job. We're desperate. My husband spends far more than he can ever earn. I don't mean he's lazy - he's not at all - he works all day long. It's just! he's not practical. Money simply slips through his fingers, it's really ridiculous, Your Excellency. I know you help musicians. You're famous for it. Give him just this one post. We'd be forever indebted!
