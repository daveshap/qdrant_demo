Every time I fail it reminds me of how much I really hate myself
I'm no good at anything no matter how hard I try. Even the things I like to do. I play video games for escapeism but just end up getting mad because whenever I lose it reminds me of how I'm not even good at them. 

My grandfather hates me because I can't do anything right. I'm pretty sure my father lies to himself that I'm worth something. He's good at everything and I'm just a disappointment.

I can't even talk to my extended family because I'm that socially awkward. I can't get a job. I don't understand why I had to be born if I can't do anything right. If I had a choice I'd rather never had existed at all
