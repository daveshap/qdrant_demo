DOCTOR: Have you been in Boulder long, Mrs. Torrance?
WENDY: Only about three months. Eh we're from Vermont. My husband was teaching school there.
DOCTOR: Did the appearance of Danny's imaginary friend...?
WENDY: Tony.
DOCTOR: Did Tony's first appearance happen to coincide with your arrival here?
WENDY: No, um let's see I guess Danny started talkin to Tony about the time we put him into nursery school.
