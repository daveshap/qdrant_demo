KATHRYN: I'm Kathryn.
ANNETTE: Annette Harrison.
KATHRYN: Have we met?
ANNETTE: I don't think so.
KATHRYN: Did you know Sebastian well?
ANNETTE: You might say that.
KATHRYN: Now I remember. Annette Harrison. Your father's the new headmaster at Oakwood.
ANNETTE: That's right.
KATHRYN: I'm sure you're going to love it there.
KATHRYN: Are you okay?
ANNETTE: I'll be fine.
KATHRYN: Well, I'll leave you alone now. I just came in here to get something of mine.
ANNETTE: Thank you.
KATHRYN: Look, I know this sounds corny, but whenever I feel like I can't go on I... turn to Jesus and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism, but -
ANNETTE: Oh cut the shit, Kathryn.
KATHRYN: Excuse me?
ANNETTE: You heard me.
KATHRYN: Who the hell do you think you are coming into my house and saying those things to me. My brother is dead, have some respect.
ANNETTE: Kathryn, I know all about you and Sebastian.
KATHRYN: Sebastian was a pathological liar. I wouldn't believe a word he -
ANNETTE: I have his journal.
KATHRYN: You what?
ANNETTE: His journal. He sent it to me the day before he died. Everything about you is in it. The blow jobs, the hand jobs, the menages, your bout with bulimia, the affair you had with your guidance counselor and how he gave you... eww. Let's see, then there's your coke problem... You still keep it in your crucifix, don't you? It's all in there.
KATHRYN: You didn't show it to anybody?
ANNETTE: Actually, I was planning on running down to Kinkos. Do you think you could give me ride?
KATHRYN: You can't do this to me. It could ruin me.
ANNETTE: I know.
