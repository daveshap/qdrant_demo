ELIJAH: How certain are you that you haven't been sick in your life?
DAVID: Seventy-five percent.
ELIJAH: Seventy-five percent? That's not nearly good enough for me. I'm extremely skeptical.
DAVID: Skeptical about what?
ELIJAH: Your answer to my question. It's one thing to have never been injured in your life, but to state that you've never taken ill, well that's a whole new level.
