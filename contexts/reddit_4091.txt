How long do you date someone before you make it an official relationship (exclusively and/or title of boyfriend or girlfriend, etc)? Or are there certain things that need to happen first?
Iâ€™m not asking for advice. Just curious what other people feel on this.

For me (27f) they need to know certain things about my life, meet my nearby family and friends, and our dreams for the future need to be compatible.
