COMMODUS: Throw it down into the streets! Down into the Forum. If it's my father they want then give him to them!
FALCO: Yes. You know, that's not a bad idea.
COMMODUS: Maybe it'll crush Gaius.
FALCO: I'm serious.
COMMODUS: So am I.
FALCO: We can crush Gaius another way. What if you do throw something to the people they really want? Make them a gift of food.
COMMODUS: Give away food?
FALCO: Sacks of grain, even bread. I own the grain licenses for the military, I can arrange to divert a shipment bound for the army of the Danube.
COMMODUS: Take grain away from the army?
FALCO: Make a gift to the people. It's your money anyway so it's only fair.
