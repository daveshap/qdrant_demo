Finally reached $2000.00 in emergency savings!
It's taken almost 2 years. I paid off one medical account and made a payment on another medical account. I looked at what I had in balance in my checking to make it to the next pay period and moved $400.00 over to my savings account.

I still have some outstanding medical accounts that I am paying on but cars will break, appliances will die or who knows what life will bring. So I am still putting money away so I will not be caught with nothing to work with.

Thanks to everyone who has inspired me to keep working to find a better place financially. It's been hard but is totally worth it.
