The 2nd amendment is pretty vague on what constitutes gun ownership. What laws and Court rulings have defined how the 2nd amendment should be implemented?

"... the right of the people to keep and Bear arms, shall not be infringed."

After reading and participating in the thread about the fourteenth amendment the other day, I realized that how an amendment is interpreted and implemented is not so simple, especially if a part of it's language is vague.

The 2nd amendment does not define what "arms" is nor what it would be to "keep" and "bear" them. I want to know how further laws, as well as courts and their rulings, have come to define these terms and decide upon how their rights should be implemented.
