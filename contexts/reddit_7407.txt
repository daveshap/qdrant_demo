Evernote vs Notion for Notes
Hi! I just had a quick question about digital note taking strategies. I’ll be starting Grad School in the Fall and I wanted to start working and utilizing one of these systems. Is there any recommendations from the community on using either one of these? Any advice on taking notes for books on digital (I’m usually a pen and paper person!)?
