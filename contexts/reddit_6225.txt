Question about Background Check
So my new employer has actually hired me (I signed the contracts and everything and today is my second day on the job). For reference, I’m at a consulting company and yet to go on site to a client.

However they have not yet completed the background check and I just filled out the employment and education verification consent forms today.

I’m wondering, do they check primarily to validate the information I presented on my resume, or do they scour for all traces of me? The post secondary I listed on my resume is correct and I do have a proper degree from there. And I have worked in a job relevant to my current one for 2 years after that (I don’t remember if I disclosed my full education for that check, or if they even asked for full education verification in that check)

However, I have a post secondary school that I didn’t finish from which is not listed in my resume (disciplinary expulsion back in 2013 when I was a dumb kid, but no criminal record from it) and I didn’t list it on the background check forms. Will that turn up on a search? If someone were to actually look at the years, there is a gap between my secondary and most recent post secondary, but I’m wondering if the check is conducted based on all public and voluntarily submitted information. 

And if I were to have disclosed it, would a check be able to uncover the reason behind my leaving? I would rather avoid all this if possible because everything on my resume can be verified properly, but if this will get out then I would like to get out ahead of it and amend my disclosure and explain later if necessary
