missed called from potential employer
I had a missed call from a retailer that i applied for a few weeks ago. I was still in class when that call was made and I didn’t know who phone number was it, until I google it. They didn’t leave a voicemail, so I dont know if I should call back or just wait if they’ll call me again. Have anyone ever had this happened before, what did you guys do in this kind of situation?
