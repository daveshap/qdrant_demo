What probability of injecting invalid data is considered safe? I encrypt some sensitive data with AES128 and I use custom method (encrypted CRC) for providing data integrity. I have calculated the probability of successful injection of invalid data that equals 4.54e-13. It means that if an attacker injects one random packet per 1 ms the probability of successfully injecting invalid data within a month is at the level of 1e-3.Would you consider this as safe solution? I know that the answer depends on the sensitivity of the data but I struggle to find information what probabilities of injecting invalid data are considered safe
