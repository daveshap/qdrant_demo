Does anyone else have this thing where if strangers laugh near you, they must be laughing at you?
**EDIT:** Wow I didn't think I'd get this many comments. I'm doing my best to reply, stay strong everyone! 

I used to get bullied a lot, and it happened for many years. Kindergarten to like 10th grade, so it's kind of become ingrained in me and it's hard to completely shake it. I'm almost 25, so it feels ridiculous. 

I especially have this with groups of teenagers, I'm genuinely afraid of them lol

If I'm in a group I might not even think of it, but alone is a different story.

What's your experience been with this? Did you eventually get over it?
