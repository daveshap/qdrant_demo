People doing what you love: how did you get to a place where you're doing what you love?
The older I get, and the more days go on, I realize, I just want to be doing something I love. This is so simple, yet seems so complicated (I mean, with life).

To all the people out there who feel purpose, motivation, and anticipation every day that they work, socialize, and otherwise live - what is your advice for how you got into a space where life mostly consisted of just doing stuff that you love?
