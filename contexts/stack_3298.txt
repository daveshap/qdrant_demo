90s Sci-Fi series about a vigilante with a bullet proof suit I'm trying to find an old series that I saw on TV in the 90s.I don't remember exactly the plot just fragments but it was about a vigilante of some sort. I remember he had a cool black costume that had some sort of force field around it that made it bullet proof. I remember a motorcycle too (not sure though) which also had the same force field.It was a short TV series or maybe it was a pilot for something that didn't make it into a series.
