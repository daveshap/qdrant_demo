Just wanted to say something for the ones scared of making a move....
If you're scared of being rejected, I know how you feel.  

I got rejected on the 11th by, and it kinda hurt.  This is probably my third or fourth rejection in my lifetime.  If you want, stalk my profile and read about how I kept on hesitating with other girls.  I realize now that the ones who responded are right.

You should go and just ask her out, and if she says no, either stay friends if you already are friends, or lessen your contact with her

Trust me, it's better to let her know how you feel and find out how she feels about you, rather than trying to decipher her actions in the hopes that she's hinting something.  In my opinion, that's just going to hurt **you**.

Yes, I know it'll hurt, and there's going to be some "facing the music" initially, but eventually you'll move on.  As others say, there are other girls out there.

**PS**: this is also a reminder for me because I really liked the girl I asked out, and there is still some residual hurting, if that makes sense.  But I'm close to moving on, and I'll have to deal with awkward scenarios and less contact with her, which is good because that means I can move on without being reminded of her.
