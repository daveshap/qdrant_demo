ACCEPTED INTO CS PROGRAM (At a CC) !!!
Guess who is studying CLOWN SCIENCE at Circus Center (CC) !!!! I know it isn't much but it's great news after being rejected from Unicycles of Clowns - Berkeley, Honkey Mudd, and Ronald McGill University.

(Jokes aside) if you are serious about Computer Science and want to possibly major in it, I made a video about if CS is actually right for you. Most people donâ€™t understand what a computer science degree actually is (hint: its not creating websites.) [check it out here](https://youtu.be/FPu2S_qEN5s)
