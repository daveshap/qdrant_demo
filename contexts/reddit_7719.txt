How do you make connections in grad school?
I'm in a part time professional masters program, and I work full time.  I basically show up to campus, go to class, take my tests, go home and get my grades.  My motivation for the degree is career advancement, rather than academic, and already my classes have helped me immeasurably at work.  However, it recently occurred to me that I'm not doing anything "extra", like I did in undergrad, and I'm halfway through the program. Now, granted, given the fact that I work full time in the field I'm going to school for, I don't really feel like I need part time work experience or internships, but I just feel like it would be nice to have something to put on my resume when I'm done besides my final project and GPA. I also haven't really grown close with professors who could be a reference for me. 


The problem is that the classes are huge, it's difficult to be able to talk to the professors before and after class, I live far away and classes get out late when I have work early the next morning, so I don't like to hang around after class, and they hardly respond to emails. In addition, because I work during normal business hours, it's tough to attend department events, though that is something I'm going to see if I can work into my schedule somehow. But even when I attended those events in undergrad, it didn't really help me connect with professors. It seemed like there the department size was smaller and everyone was working on the same degree, so it was easy to help a professor with research.  My grad school is much larger and more impersonal, and I'm kind of the low man on the totem pole, below PhDs and full time masters students. 


So what do you guys think? Any ideas or advice on how to get a bit more involved? Is it even necessary for me to get involved to advance? Thanks!
