Sorry folks, we've got a troll: Please message the moderators if you get harassed via PM after posting here.
We are **so** sorry that this is necessary.

In recent days we've been targeted by a PM troll who's been sending pro-suicide messages to people after they post here.  The admins have suspended the main account this person was using, and they're looking out for alts, but if these types of individuals sometimes try to get around their site-wide bans.  We feel it's better to let you know this might happen again so that you can be forewarned, and also so that if it does happen, we and the reddit community team will be alerted as soon as possible.

If you get a hateful, pro-suicide PM, please be aware that this person is doing this indiscriminately, and they probably haven't even read what you posted, so it's *not about you*.  

If you don't think you could handle receiving something like that, we completely understand.  In that case, your best protection is to set your messaging preference so that you can receive PMs from trusted users only before you post (anywhere, not just here) about your struggles.  

On desktop you can do that here:

(On mobile, it depends which app or browser you're using.)
