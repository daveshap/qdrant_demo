Summer Internships/Practica
I am trying to do a summer practicum/internship and I have an idea of what I want to do. Down the road, I want to work as a college access professional. Something like TRIO/summer bridge/EOPs. I have also been considering college counseling/advising jobs. So far my experiences have been in Leadership Education and Development, Career Services and Academic Advising, Orientation, and in the future Academic Support Services. My question is what are some functional areas that I might consider to round off my experience this summer while a grad student? All suggestions welcome!
