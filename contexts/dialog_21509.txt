LITTLE OLD LADY: Feeling better?
LITTLE OLD LADY: Good. Let's fool around. Now, I'll be the innocent little milk maid and you'll be the naughty stable boy. Oh, this milk is so heavy. I'll never reach the house. Help. Will someone help me?
BIALYSTOCK: Wait. Wait. We can't play today. I have too many appointments.
LITTLE OLD LADY: We can't play today?
BIALYSTOCK: Thursday. Thursday. We'll play Thursday. We'll play the Contessa and the chauffeur.
LITTLE OLD LADY: Oh, the best one.
BIALYSTOCK: Until Thursday, then, Contessa Mio.
LITTLE OLD LADY: Oh, Bialy, please, just a little. Just a little.
BIALYSTOCK: All right. All right.
