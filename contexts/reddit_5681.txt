After applying to 200 companies, I finally got a job offer but I am not sure if it's wise for me to take it.
So I finally got a job offer and its with JCPenney's HQ and I will be a process engineer for them.   
So I will be compensated accordingly for the work that I will be doing and I am truly happy that I got a job in my field. However, I am from a different state and that means that I will have to travel down there, get rent, etc.   
My biggest concern is with the direction that JCPenney's headed. Looking at the news, it keeps saying that JCPenney's going out of business and that genuinely worries me. I don't want to work for them for less than a year and be jobless in a state that I don't belong in. What should I do? It's my dream job but idk if its the right company.   
And i also don't want to decline it either because it's my first real job offer and I really need it. I mean as long as the company doesn't go under within the 4-5 years, I can definitely manage but until then that's reality, I'm not sure.   
please give me advice on whether or not this is the correct choice.
