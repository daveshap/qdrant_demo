JUD: No--but if he drops by, I'll tell him to call you.
RACHEL: Jud, do you remember the name of the student that died on Louis's first day at work? The one that was hit by a car?
RACHEL: Was it Pascow?
JUD: Ayuh, I think 'twas. If I see Louis come home before I go to bed, I'll tell him to--
RACHEL: Don't bother. I'm coming home.
