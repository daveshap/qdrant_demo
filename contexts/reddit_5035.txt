Do previous rejected applications effect new applications when applying online?
Just wondering if I apply online and get rejected for position A, will there be like a note that may be taken into consideration 2 months later when I apply for Position B with the same company. I am am about in both cases if I do get an interview offer but don't get the job or Do not get an interview offer at all.
