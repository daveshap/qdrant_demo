MARION: What news?
GABRIEL: The British army is barricaded in Boston. Harry Lee, is here from Virginia, recruiting for a Continental Army.
MARION: Is that why the Assembly was convened?
GABRIEL: Yes. He seeks a levy of troops and money.
MARION: And the Governor?
GABRIEL: He vowed that if the Assembly votes a single shilling to Lee, he'll dissolve the body.
MARION: Which would force our delegates in Philadelphia to vote for independence.
CHARLOTTE: And send us to war alongside Massachusetts.
MARION: Our governor is a bigger fool than I thought.
