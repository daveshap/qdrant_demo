Low energy things that can boost your mood
I thought it'd be nice to post some non-strenuous things that keep me going when I'm feeling really down. Idk about anyone else but I find sometimes that doing or achieving something small can give me a boost to do harder things like laundry, showering, cleaning etc. Comment your own!

- changing an item of clothing like socks, underwear, t shirt etc
- washing my face or brushing my teeth
- flicking through a non fiction book and reading the captions on the pictures
- feeding my goldfish (her name is debbie ocean and I love her dearly) 
- free line doodling - draw a continuous line and try to fill up the page
- sorting out your wallet/purse (it's so satisfying when it's flat again) 
- making a drink that's a little bit more effort than just tap water, like cordial, milkshake, or even just putting ice in a cold drink 
- emptying a waste paper basket into the outside bins
- watching an episode of a show you like but haven't watched in a long time (be careful not to binge though)
- messaging a friend an inside joke
- finding something sortable and sorting it like stacks of coins, mail etc - for me it's my scarves
- cleaning your glasses/phone properly
