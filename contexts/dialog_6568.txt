VAUGHAN: I've always wanted to drive a crashed car.
JAMES: You could get your wish at any moment.
VAUGHAN: No, I mean a crash with a history. Camus' Facel Vega, or Nathaniel Nest's station wagon, Grace Kelly's Rover 3500. Fix it just enough to get it rolling. Don't clean it, don't touch anything else.
JAMES: Is that why you drive this car? I take it that you see Kennedy's assassination as a special kind of car-crash?
VAUGHAN: The case could be made.
