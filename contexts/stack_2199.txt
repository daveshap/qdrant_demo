Share games between PSN users It's been a while since I've bought games from the PSN store. In a lot of games' descriptions, I've seen a section that says \"2-n Network players\where n is some larger number.Does this indicate that I am able to share my games with friends?If yes, does this mean that my friends can play the entire game? By that I mean, would he/she be able to play the story mode of the game? Could they even play the game online in online rooms?Or is this just indicating that I can play together with friends?
