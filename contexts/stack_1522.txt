I'm planning to put lots of phone chargers on one circuit, how to calculate this This would be primarily for samsung S7 devices.  Would like to be able to charge, say, 256 of them.They will work in groups of 16, trying to design the power flow of this.  Was imagining that each group of 16 would plug into a USB power strip of some kind, and then each group of 16 would link up to another power strip.So, 16 groups of 16.But I think that this will not work on a single 120V/15A power source.  I would like to understand the math involved with how to scale this.It will probably be more like 100 devices at a time, but trying to understand how to calculate this and know what the limits are.
