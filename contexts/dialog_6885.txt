KATHRYN: Oh my God. You're completely p-whipped.
SEBASTIAN: No, I'm not.
KATHRYN: P-whipped, p-whipped.
SEBASTIAN: What's wrong with you? Why are you acting this way?
KATHRYN: I'm sorry. It's just upsetting. You're in love with her. You don't love me anymore.
SEBASTIAN: Oh come on, Kathryn, it was just a contest.
KATHRYN: At first it was, but now it's become something bigger.
SEBASTIAN: Kathryn, you know I love you. I've always loved you.
KATHRYN: Not anymore you don't. It's obvious.
SEBASTIAN: I can't believe you're reacting this way. You're just saying this because you lost the bet.
KATHRYN: Is that what you think?
SEBASTIAN: That's not fair. You're taking all the fun out of it.
KATHRYN: Then do me a favor and get rid of her. If not for me, then do it for you. Look at yourself. You're a joke. She's turned you into jelly. What do you want to be, one of those losers who walk down the halls holding hands and smiling. People used to respect you. They feared you and now you're going to throw that all away.
KATHRYN: Why so nervous?
SEBASTIAN: I've never done this before.
KATHRYN: How have you dumped girls in the past?
SEBASTIAN: Screening calls. Any suggestions?
KATHRYN: I knew this guy last summer in the Hamptons. He and his girlfriend at the time were madly in love with each other. But she had this huge weight problem. His friends taunted him mercilessly about it. You know, How do you breathe when she sits on your face?" "It's embarrassing for you to be seen with her." Finally he couldn't take it anymore and decided to dump her. She flipped and he went on the defensive. I distinctly remember him saying the same thing over and over again. "I'm completely fucked up." "I'm completely fucked up." "I'm completely fucked up." Poor fatty never had a chance."
