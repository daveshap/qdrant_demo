After 20 years of life no one knows me well enough to give me a eulogy
You ever sit around just picturing your funeral? Hell I don’t even want a funeral. No one cared enough to get to know me when I was alive and they surely won’t care when I’m dead. I wish that could actually be arranged. To just get thrown into the ground without a word being said. Cause that’s how I lived my life, no one wanted me around alive and I don’t want them around when I’m dying.
