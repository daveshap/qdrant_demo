MRS. O'REILLY: That fool didn't know what was the meaning of a hundred-pound bill, which was in the pocket-book that the fellow took from me.
RODERICK: I am riding to Dublin myself, and if your ladyship will allow me the honor of riding with you, I shall do my best to protect you from further mishap.
MRS. O'REILLY: But I shouldn't like to put you to such trouble, Mister...?
RODERICK: O'Higgins... Mohawk O'Higgins.
RODERICK: As you have been robbed of your purse, may I have permission to lend your ladyship a couple of pieces to pay any expenses which you might incur before reaching your home?
MRS. O'REILLY: That's very kind of you, Mr. O'Higgins.
RODERICK: How different was her lively rattle to the vulgar wenches at Kilwangan assemblies. In every sentence, she mentioned a lord or a person of quality. To the lady's question about my birth and parentage, I replied that I was a young gentleman of large fortune, that I was going to Dublin for my studies, and that my mother allowed me five hundred per annum.
MRS. O'REILLY: You must be very cautious with regard to the company you should meet in Dublin, where rogues and adventurers of all countries abound. I hope you will do me the honor of accepting lodgings in my own house, where Captain O'Reilly will welcome with delight, my gallant young preserver.
