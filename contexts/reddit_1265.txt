Does anyone else get anxiety when they are waiting on someone to answer them?
Whenever I send text messages and it takes someone an unusual amount of time to answer I find myself getting more and more anxious. To the point where I start being concerned for their health and well being, and then to the point of convincing myself they are mad at me or donâ€™t want to talk to me anymore. What do you guys do to calm down in a situation like and not let your mind go crazy?
