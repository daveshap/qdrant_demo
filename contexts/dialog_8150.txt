JACK: I'm trying to figure what angle you're playing <u>this</u> time, but I sure as hell can't see one.
EXLEY: I've given up angles for awhile. I just want to solve this thing.
JACK: The Nite Owl was solved, Lieutenant.
EXLEY: I want to do it right.
JACK: Okay, college boy, I'll help you. But I want half the collar.
EXLEY: A third. I don't think we can make a case without Bud White.
STOMPANATO: Wendell White, how's tricks, <u>paesano</u>?
BUD: I ain't your <u>paesano</u>, you wop cocksucker.
STOMPANATO: What do you want, <u>officer</u>?
BUD: You remember an ex-cop named Buzz Meeks? He works for a guy named Patchett.
STOMPANATO: Should I?
BUD: His file listed you as a known associate. Now spill.
STOMPANATO: Oh, yeah. That was a long time ago. Before your day. The last few years he's been muscle for hire. But I heard he's disappeared.
BUD: More.
STOMPANATO: More's gonna cost you.
BUD: How 'bout I give you your balls back?
STOMPANATO: Before Meeks disappeared he was popping off about trying to move eighteen pounds of heroin.
BUD: Bullshit. Where would a two-bit ex-cop get 18 pounds of heroin?
STOMPANATO: Deuce Perkins. Mickey C's narcotics lieutenant. The night he got clipped, eighteen pounds of Mickey's heroin went missing.
STOMPANATO: Meeks is probably in Rio or someplace like that by now.
BUD: He's under a tract house in San Berdoo. And he don't smell too good. What happened to the heroin, Johnny?
STOMPANATO: I don't know. I swear it!
