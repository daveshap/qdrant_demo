WES: If! If there's a treasure.
JAEGER: Yeah. If. Whatever. What kind you figure it is?

JAEGER: Yeah! Gold! How much?
WES: How the hell should I know how much?
EPPS: But that's the great thing about Gold. A little goes a long way.
JAEGER: You know what I'm doing with my part of the gold?
WES: If there's gold. If!

JAEGER: Yeah. I meant... You know what I'm going to do with it? I'm going to buy a Sixty- three 'Vette Stingray. All tricked out and cherry. I'm going to be so sweet.

JAEGER: What are you going to do with your <u>third</u>?
EPPS: Invest it.
JAEGER: Oh, that's fun.

JAEGER: And I'm talking about enjoying myself.
EPPS: You know, you sound just like a boy who's never--
