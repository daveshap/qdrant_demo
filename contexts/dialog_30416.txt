LIZ: Money?
BARRY MORRIS: Yes money. Adam had a five hundred dollar Term Life Insurance Policy.
LIZ: What does that mean?
FISHER: That means we get five hundred thousand to help raise the kids.
LIZ: No.
FISHER: Yes.
BARRY MORRIS: Actually, no. Adam was switching to a Whole Life Policy, but re-scheduled his medical exam...and failed to make his last payment...so his Term Life lapsed. So it's value is null and void. Now he did have a pension account, worth another 150 thousand.
LIZ: Well, oh...
BARRY MORRIS: And a house. Valued at 350 thousand.
LIZ: So where's that leave us?
