MILTON: Well then, I guess I'll be leaving then.
GALE: Oh come on! Why the hostility?
MILTON: Listen Lois Lane, I love your show and all but last month I happened to catch your little segment on me and how my wife left me because I'm a sex addict who enjoys screwing fifteen year old girls. It was a real eye opener my lawyers are still thinking about bringing to your superior's attentions.
GALE: They're the ones who approved it.
GALE: Alright Kincaid, no where to?
DETECTIVE KINCAID: I go to the police station and do my job, and you go back to being Gale Weathers.
GALE: Oh. I thought you wanted me to stick around.
DETECTIVE KINCAID: Look, Miss Weathers, if there's a problem, give me a call. Here's my card. I'm always there.
