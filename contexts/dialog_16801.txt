KLIGMAN: You don't want any water?
LINDA: No...I just... I'm so fucked up here Alan, I don't know...there's so much...so many things --
KLIGMAN: Are you on drugs right now?
LINDA: If I talk to you...y'know...if I tell you things...then you're a lawyer, right? You can't say things, you can't tell anyone, it's like the privelage, right? Attornery-client, you understand?
KLIGMAN: Not exactly, Linda. I'm not sure where you're going with this --
LINDA: Like a shrink, like if I go to see a shrink, I'm protected, I can say things -- fuck -- I don't know what I'm doing --
KLIGMAN: Linda, you're safe. Ok. It's alright. You're my friend. You and Earl are my clients and what you need to talk about won't leave this room, you have something you have to say --
LINDA: -- I have something to tell you. I have to tell you something. I want to change his will, can I change his will?...I need to ---
KLIGMAN: You can't change his will. Only Earl can change his will.
LINDA: No, no....no, you see...I never loved him. I never loved him, Earl. When I started, when I met him, I met him and I fucked him and I married him because I wanted his money, do you understand? I'm telling you this now...this I've never told anyone...I didn't love him. And now....I know I'm in that will, I know, I was there with him, we were all there together when we made that fucking thing and all the money I'II get -- I don't want it -- Because I love him so much now...I've fallen in love with him now, for real, as he's dying, and I look at him and he's about to go, Alan, he's dead...he's moments... I took care of him through this, Alan. And What Now Then?
