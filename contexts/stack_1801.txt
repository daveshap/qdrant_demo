Things in English that Are often very confusing for Non-Native Speakers Something that has really confused me over the years is when and where to use past simple or present perfect, as a non-native English speaker I have always been troubled by this, so I was just wondering if you guys could help !Look at the examples below :1) Discipline and hard work are the things that I have learnt in school. or Discipline and hard work are the things that I learnt in school. (situation - I am in college right now and I am talking about things what I was taught in school that I still remember that means I can still relate to things that I had learnt in the past)2) Why are you on a wheelchair ?Ans : Because I have fallen off the terrace and injured myself.Or Because I fell off the terrace and injured myself.(PS: We've always been taught that if a incident in the past has a connection with the present, use present perfect but here the first one sounds unnatural to me )3) Cristiano Ronaldo won the Best Player of the Year xyxx.or Cristiano Ronaldo has won the Best Player of the year xyxx.(PS: we are still in the year xyxx)4) I have changed 3 schools in my school life.Or I changed 3 schools in my school life.
