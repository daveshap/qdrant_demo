DULANEY: How do you know it was cocaine that Miss Lawson had in the bathroom?
JOANNE: What other kind of white powder do people keep in a vial?
DULANEY: Do you remember the date when you saw Miss Lawson in the bathroom?
JOANNE: Yes-- It was on a Friday. I remember because I was going to visit my sister for her birthday. It would be October twenty-eighth.
DULANEY: Could you repeat the last part of what Mr. Marsh said to you the day before his death?
JOANNE: He said that if it kept up she was going to kill him. That his heart couldn't take it.
DULANEY: Didn't Mr. Marsh also tell you that Miss Lawson felt bored here and was thinking about going back to Chicago for awhile?
JOANNE: Yes -- he mentioned it.
DULANEY: So, the woman he loved passionately was thinking about leaving. That must cause tremendous anxiety. Sleepless nights. Incredible stress.
JOANNE: I suppose.
DULANEY: So, isn't it possible that he was confiding in you about the pain he was feeling about losing what might be his last chance for love? That what he really was saying was that the uncertainty of her leaving was driving him crazy and if it didn't stop it was going to kill him. That if she did leave his heart couldn't take it.
JOANNE: I don't know. I'm not sure.
DULANEY: Well, think about it. Isn't it possible?
JOANNE: Yes. I suppose it's possible.
REBECCA: You were brilliant today.
DULANEY: It's only the beginning.
