MILES: To victory.
MARYLIN: I don't feel victorious Miles. I feel betrayed, abandoned and humiliated. I have pictures of him with another woman...
MILES: More pictures? My God, Marylin. You can open an erotic art gallery.
MARYLIN: Did you invite me here to score some cheap laughs.
MILES: No. Just to comfort you, and appreciate you --
MARYLIN: You really think I engineered the whole thing. You think the marriage and the divorce was part of some scheme. You came here to celebrate because you think I'm without morality or soul. You -- sound like my mother.
