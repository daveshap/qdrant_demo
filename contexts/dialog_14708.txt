HOAGIE: Our little island seems to agree with you....
ELLEN: I have my own little island.
HOAGIE: But it gets cold in winter....
HOAGIE: I tried winter once. Burlington, Vermont. Flew a run to New York. I have a bone in my foot that still hasn't thawed. When I was a small boy....
ELLEN: That's hard to imagine....
HOAGIE: I dreamed about always being warm... Stay a while....
HOAGIE: I could take some time off....
ELLEN: You're always taking time off....
HOAGIE: I like to travel....
HOAGIE: I'll nick the boss' plane again....
ELLEN: What?
HOAGIE: I borrow it without telling him....
ELLEN: Won't you get in trouble...?
HOAGIE: Only if he finds out... It's a short hop to the Caribbean. We could take a few days....
ELLEN: There must be plenty of women who would be glad to go....
HOAGIE: There are...I'm tired of one-way conversations....
HOAGIE: I have this overwhelming desire to kiss you, Ellen Brody.
ELLEN: Why?
HOAGIE: Because it wouldn't occur to you to know why. Blushing suits you....
ELLEN: I'm sorry...I....
HOAGIE: There's nothing to be sorry about.
ELLEN: The whole idea is preposterous....
