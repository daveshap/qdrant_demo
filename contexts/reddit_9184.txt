I did it, I actually saved up three months rent.
It's been an absolute grind. I've had horrific jobs, almost been homeless, definitely been hungry, but I've finally moved past it. About 7 months ago I landed a new job selling basic pharmaceutical equipment and I've been able to get out of the poverty grind and actually save up enough padding to really work on my debt. 

I cried this morning when I checked my balance. I still can't believe it isn't a prank. All thanks to a new job and tips I learned here. 

Thank you!
