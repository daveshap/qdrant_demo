LOUIS: Is it ready to go?
MELANIE: Yeah, there's another hit left.
JACKIE: The Cockatoo Inn.
ORDELL: The Cockatoo Inn? Where's that?
JACKIE: It's right on Hawthorne Boulevard and Manhattan Beach Boulevard. It's red brick...
ORDELL: Oh, wait, you mean that place that has the big sign with a rooster on it?
JACKIE: It's a cockatoo.
MELANIE: You okay?
LOUIS: Yeah, I'm just gettin' old. I can't smoke or laugh now it seems without coughing.
MELANIE: Coughing opens up the capillaries. When you cough, you're getting air -- in this case smoke -- to parts of the lung that don't normally get used. Coughing's good -- gets ya higher. My dad coughs when he smokes all the time.
