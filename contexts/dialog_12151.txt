HAROLD: Now--turn around, if you would.
PENELOPE: Turn around?
HAROLD: I'm not about to introduce to you a jungle novelty. What I have in mind is massage--a perfectly decent massage. Turn around, turn around.
HAROLD: I'm going to touch your shoulders very gently now. You mustn't scream. So tense, so tense.
PENELOPE: You shouldn't have talked to Norbert that way.
HAROLD: You're thinking with your brain instead of your body. That's why you're so tense! Forget Norbert. Relax. It's body time.
PENELOPE: I have a brain.
HAROLD: We all do. But now it's body time. Relax. Ideally, the body of a woman should feel like a hot water bottle filled with Devonshire cream. You feel like a paper bag crammed with curtain rods. Think of your muscles one by one. Let them go slack. Relax. Let the brain go blank. Relax. That's the idea-- that's my girl. Now the small of the back. Let those knots over those kidneys unsnarl.
PAUL: Dad--
HAROLD: Couldn't you have vanished quietly out the back door?
PAUL: A hundred dollars for breakfast?
HAROLD: Leave a tip.
PENELOPE: I have some change!
HAROLD: Ram it up your ass!
