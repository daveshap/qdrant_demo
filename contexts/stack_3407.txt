Old young adult sci fi book about wars fought with robots remotely, allusions to chess This is a science fiction book I read about the year 2000.  The main premise that I vaguely remember was that humans were now fighting wars with robots by proxy BUT there were still normal humans in the war zones trying to survive.I don't have much more to go on I'm sorry - but the main scene/piece that sticks out to me, was there were these \"burrowing\" robots that were the \"hunter-killers\" for the non-robot humans - I think the characters referred to these robots as Ferrets, Stoats or Weasels. I think at the end they made it to the control room or something, and realised it was all some big game of real life chess so to speak that they were caught in the middle of.English book, unsure if series. Possible female main character but unsure.
