He deleted his tinder in front of me on our first date?
A few weeks back I started seeing this guy, I've had some interesting dates from tinder (my fav being the flat earther--obviously ended that), anyway me and this gentleman hit it off straight away we ended up having a 3 hour telephone conversation before our first date and such.

Anyway when we were on the date obviously how we met came up and I admitted I had deleted my profile (he noticed that I wasn't on his messages anymore) and he pulled his phone out and said 'I'll take that as a good sign' and then proceeded to just delete his tinder.

This isn't really looking for advice as I am just going to assume that it's a good sign (our subsequent dates and such have been ace anyway)
