COHEN: What do you mean Deuce Perkins got clipped last night?!
STOMPANATO: They shot him in his library.
COHEN: I don't want a floor plan; I want to know who! Who's taking the ticket for this, Johnny?
STOMPANATO: Nobody. At least not yet.
COHEN: And what about the merchandise Deuce was holding for me?
STOMPANATO: Gone. Not a trace.
COHEN: Some ferstunkener is moving in and we don't know who?! Maybe we should ask Hedda Hopper!
