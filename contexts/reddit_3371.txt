Never stop those little acts of love and attention
Just don't. 

They matter. You might not be aware of how much they do all of the time but they show how much you care in simple and little ways and make the other person feel appreciated.

May it be a simple good night text. A kiss or heart emoji others might think are childish. A cute nickname you only use when you two are alone. Holding hands like you're still teenagers...

Whatever you do... Keep doing it.

You don't know how much it may mean to the other person, even tough it might seem like nothing much to you. And it might just break their heart a little if you just suddenly stop.

Just wanted to put this out there.
