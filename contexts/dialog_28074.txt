SAM: I am?
MAX: Yeah. I'm not trying to replace your Dad... or steal your Mom. I just want to be your friend.
LUCY: I'm really sorry, Max.
MAX: Our batting average isn't very good is it? So far we're zero for two.
LUCY: I don't understand Sam. He's just not like this.
MAX: Boys Sam's age need a good deal of discipline, or they walk all over you.
LUCY: He doesn't walk all over me.
MAX: I don't want to fight with you, Lucy. Come on. Let's give it one more try. Dinner at my house, tomorrow night. I'm cooking.
MICHAEL: Where is she?!
DAVID: Hey, take it easy.
MICHAEL: Where's Star, David?!
DAVID: If you ever want to see Star again, then you better come with us.
MICHAEL: What is this, David?
DAVID: You're one of us, now -- aren't you?
