ROB: Hi.
LAURA: Hi. I've been looking for an envelope of my receipts from last month and I'm thinking I didn't take them with me. Have you seen them around?
ROB: I'll look for 'em. How you doing?
LAURA: I'm sorry to call, but I need that stuff...
ROB: Fine, I'm sure it's in the file at home. I'll call you when I find it, and then we'll talk.
LAURA: We'll talk some other time.
ROB: Great... That's great.
