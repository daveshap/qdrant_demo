CLAUDE: Spanky's gonna be pissed? Poor Spanky. Fuck Spanky! What the hell kind of a name is Spanky, anyway? You're responsible for this situation. I blame you for everything. If it wasn't for you, I'd be home having a hot meal right now.
RAY: If it wasn't for me, you'd be washing up on the beach at Coney Island right now. I need all my thumbs and fingers for praying and doing good.""
