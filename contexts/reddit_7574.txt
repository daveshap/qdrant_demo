Help with Mendeley
I am having some issues, and I cannot find a solution. My area is Sport Science, and I am using APA 6th edition to cite.

Basically, some of the citations are wrong. For example, instead of only seeing the surname, often there are also the initials for no reason.

Just to give you an example of two citations created by Mendeley:

(Kavaliauskas, Aspe, & Babraj, 2015; H. L. Taylor, Buskirk, & Henschel, 1955)

The first one is correct, the surnames are mentioned correctly. The second one has the "H. L." at the beginning, and I cannot understand why. I looked at the paper details, and they are correct. Name and surname are indicated correctly in the details, in the correct order, and yet I can see the initials.  


Can somebody help me with this? It happens with a few papers, and it's really annoying.
