EDDY: He'll care all right. That was going to be his money. Whether he cares about us is different. Pass your phone.
BACON: Think about what you're going to say, Ed; we are on thin ice.
HATCHET: That you, boy?
EDDY: It's Ed, if that's what you mean.
HATCHET: It's pay day, ain't it?
EDDY: I wanted to talk to you about that.
HATCHET: I bet you did. I have got half a million nicker sitting in front of me, which means that some poor sod doesn't. You must have upset a few people, boy . . . but that isn't really my concern, is it? But what does concern me is the guns you had. I want to talk to you about that. Get your arse over here now, and I do mean now!
BACON: Well?
EDDY: Well what?
TOM: Well, what did he say?
EDDY: He said he thinks we have paid him, and he wants to talk about those guns . . . now.
SOAP: You what? What are you on about?
EDDY: Listen, if he has the guns he might have the money . . . I think we should go and see him.
