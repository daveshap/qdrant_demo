LEON: Man, you really bummed me out. That's a terrible story. Nigger, you crying?
JAKE: Hell, no! I just got something in my eye.
WILLIE: It's alright for a man to cry once in awhile. Just don't make a habit of it.
LEON: Hey, Willie, what was Claude's plan, anyway?
WILLIE: Nothing to it, really. Claude figured they could steal a couple of bodies from the morgue. They got a couple of crackers working there don't know their asses from their elbows. Then they was gonna set fire to the infirmary and make it look like those bodies was them that got stuck inside. Claude figured during the commotion, it wouldn't be too hard to slip onto one of the fire trucks and hang tight until it rolled right on out of here in the morning.
