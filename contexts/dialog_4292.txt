DULANEY: What happened next?
MISS SELLERS: While I was seeing Dr. Paley I mentioned to him one night that someone was stealing drugs from the third floor dispensary. Three days after I spoke to him in his office he went to the Head Nurse and told her he had witnessed me stealing drugs.
DULANEY: What happened?
MISS SELLERS: There was an inquiry. It was his word against mine. They believed him. I was fired.
BIGGS: Joanne Braslow is getting more and more interesting. I followed her today to an attorney's office. Joseph Koehler.
DULANEY: Joe Koehler. I know him. He's an estate attorney -- and he's very expensive.
BIGGS: What would Joanne Braslow need with an estate attorney? She wasn't even mentioned in Marsh's will.
