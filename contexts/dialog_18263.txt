RONNY: Son of a bitch!
LORETTA: Where are you taking me?
RONNY: To the bed.
LORETTA: Oh. Oh God. I don't care about anything. I don't care about anything! Take me to the bed.
RONNY: I can't believe what is happening.
LORETTA: Me neither.
RONNY: I was dead.
LORETTA: I was dead, too.
RONNY: Your blood.
LORETTA: All my life I have never reached a man. I knew that I would reach my husband, but I took my time and he was dead. Ronny.
RONNY: Loretta.
LORETTA: I want to cut you open and crawl inside of you. I want you to swallow me.
RONNY: I've got you.
LORETTA: Get all of me. Take everything.
RONNY: What about Johnny?
LORETTA: You're mad at him, take it out on me, take your revenge on me! Take everything, leave nothing for him to marry! Hollow me out so there's nothing left but the skin over my bones. Suck me dry!
RONNY: Alright. Alright. There will be nothing left.
