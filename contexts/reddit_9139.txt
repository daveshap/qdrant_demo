Just got told "hard work" will get me out of poverty.
Because yeah, my job pays me based on how hard I work.  


Because absolutely, finding a better-paying job is pretty easy.  


Because you bet, all I have to do is "make better financial decisions" and I'll be out of poverty.  


  


The people who say these things have no idea what it is like to truly struggle.  I'm so proud of how far I have come this year regarding my finances, however, and I'm not letting one or two privilged airheads take that away from me.  


I got my first credit card.  I have been terrified of credit after 2008 and seeing what it did to my family, but I had to do my reading and learn that credit isn't always bad as long as it is used responsibly.  


I finally have a savings account with one full paycheck in it.  It's my first emergency fund, and I'm worried about ever needing to empty it, but I have security in knowing it's there at all.  


I'm at a job that pays me more than I have ever made in my life.  It's not much at all, I'm still making less than $15k/year, but it's a lot to me.  I've even held on to this job for over a year, which is amazing for me (autism is hard, y'all).  


I honestly just wanted some place to rant and let people know how far I've come and how proud I am of myself, despite what some ignorant people have recently said to me.  I'm slowly getting better, and I'm so proud, but it's a very long road and I have a long, long way to go.  Thanks for reading. 

Edit: This blew up more than I anticipated. There’s a lot being said about what I posted here and I’m not in a space to reply or address it all. All I can say is that I’m constantly learning and adjusting. It’s all anyone should ask of themselves and of the people around them.
