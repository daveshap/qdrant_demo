Wish people realised anxiety is physical too.
I literally get such a jittery weird feeling in my body so many times a day whenever I'm anxious. Like I can't describe it but it's definitely not good. Almost like something is pinching on my organs. And the worst is when I have to wake up in the morning, it's almost like someone has placed added extra weights to my body. I literally can't get up from my bed! I try to force myself up,but I just can't. I just lay there staring at the ceiling, thinking about what I'll do with my day, get anxious about what if I won't be able to be productive today, then getting anxious about how I wasted some time the previous day, then overthinking it all nd wanting to just kill myself. I hate it.
