Some people are really classy
Went on my first date after a long break. He was sweet, smart, and a good guy. We found out we had a major incompatibility. We decided not to go out again and wished each other well. No hurt feelings, just honest and kind communication. It didnâ€™t work out, but I enjoyed the experience nonetheless. 


Good luck out there! Keep it classy!
