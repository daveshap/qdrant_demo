How do I fix a stripped hole in a vinyl casement window? While replacing my window crank with a T-crank I noticed the screw that is holding the gear box in place didn't seem to be doing it's job.  Upon further inspection it seems that it's stripped out.How do I fix a stripped hole in vinyl?  Can I just use toothpicks and wood glue like I normally would?
