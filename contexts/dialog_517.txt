SANDRO: Look... I'd like to get back to Lisca Bianca.
CARABINIERE: But how could we...at a time like this when we just... well, let's at least first have a look around the other islands. Could be that something might turn up there.
SANDRO: But even here we were supposed to find who knows what... And all we bring back with us is a crate of cigarettes.
CARABINIERE: As you wish.
