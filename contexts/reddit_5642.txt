If I choose to not relocate for my job, and the company lets me go- can I still file for unemployment (CA)
I work with a consultation company that is contracted with other organizations. The location I work at is not renewing contract and there might be another location in CA in my local area for me to move, but if that’s not an option, they will likely ask me to relocate elsewhere, even out of state. If I decline relocation (but don’t quit) and they in turn lay me off because there is no other work opportunity, can they contest unemployment or am I even eligible for unemployment? 
Appreciate any insight, I’m having trouble finding the info I need online.
