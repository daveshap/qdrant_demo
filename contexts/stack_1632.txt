Can't balance differential amplifier circuit I'm trying to build a circuit which involves an  Op Amp in differential amplifier configuration.  However I've been having difficulty balancing my output. My understanding of the differential amplifier is that if configured such that R1 = R2 = Rf = Rg then Vout should be about 0 volts except I'm always getting about 0.5-0.8 volts.I've currently set it up so that there are 5 volts going directly into R1 and R2 with all my resistors equal to 10K ohms and still I'm getting about 0.63 volts. These are diagrams of my circuit I made:Please also ignore the dashed lines.This is what I was trying to build:Edit: Original Circuit
