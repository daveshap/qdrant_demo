How much do you trust Glassdoor reviews?
I have an interview this Thursday, but I’m seeing mixed reviews for the company on Glassdoor. Some are great, and some are not so great. I’m not sure what I should believe. 

The company I’m at now isn’t great and I’m trying to get out, but I don’t want to jump into something worse. 

Have any Glassdoor reviews you’ve read turned out to be true after you started a new job?
