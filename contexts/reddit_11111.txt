I got suspended for this
Me and the boys are Russian. We pass notes in Russian. When teachers confiscate the notes they can’t read them so they either throw them out or ask us to read them. Usually we just say some random (I’m) stuff. We had a substitute for history who apparently could speak Russian, but we didn’t know that so we just kept passing notes. I wrote a note that said “If you are reading this you are gay” to my friend and that note is the one i get caught passing. I was confident nothing would happen because I thought he couldn’t speak it. Well, I’m suspended for harassment. This is very epic
