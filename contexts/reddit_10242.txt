Being an ugly woman is... difficult to say the least
Trust me, it's just as difficult for ugly girls as it is for guys - there's nothing worse than seeing your peers and friends being hit on and asked on dates, while you just blend into the background. I wake up every single day feeling lost and defeated, wondering if starving myself would make me at least a bit more appealing. it's so hard to go on social media, to see the gorgeous smiles and lovely relationships and perfect figures of other girls. 

and then there's me. 

i've been called ugly and unappealing my entire life, even my father has said so, multiple times. no guy takes a second glance at me. i'm not even smart or talented or witty either, so there's no hope for me at all. i just think.. how different my life would be if i at least looked normal, or if i had even money for cosmetic surgery. it's so hard to have a gorgeous mother and sister, and cousins who could easily be models - when you're just a fat, unappealing blob in the corner, begging for a sliver of attention.

i just don't see the point. looking in the mirror is excruciating, posing for photos unbearable. i just want to drink myself into a stupor all the time. there's just no point to life if you're a fat and ugly girl
