Guy I have been dating 2 years opened up about depression after 2 years and then disappeared??
Hi all,

This is my first post, I am totally new to the Reddit community! So, I have been dating someone truly special to me the last couple years, and he has had a few depressive spirals since about a year into things. The most he would reveal after I would ask to get together, is that he was in a bad head space where he couldn't get out of bed sometimes and felt hopeless and as though he was in a hole. He is a very social and outgoing guy, so obviously this was very out of character for him, but I never wanted to pry or push him to talk about it, and would just offer my support and understanding and let him know I was there if he needed anything. When we would see each other next, he'd not speak a word about it, only ever opened up in a lengthy text about what was going on with him.

Fast forward to a couple months ago, I tried to make plans for a Friday night, he happily agreed, and then the next night cancelled, saying he was super depressed, couldnt get out of bed, and never wanted to leave the house again. I gave him space and he asked to go out 5 days later. We went to dinner and he completely opened up about his illness, revealed he has experienced it on occasion for the last 3 years, and admitted he had a borderline suicidal thought for the first time. Like he understood why people take their own lives. He was so incredibly open and vulnerable about it, I was so proud of him. Afterwards, thinking I felt closer to him than ever before, I went out of town, came back and asked to get together, only to have him disappear. He Would take 24 hours to respond to texts, wouldnt see me. He eventually texted me saying we should just be friends but meet up and talk. Its been incredibly difficult to get him to follow through on this.

Im devastated. Is he embarrassed he revealed so much? Did he change his mind about me? I miss him and want to understand.
