WALT: Dear Walt and Icey: I bet you been worried and gave us up for lost. Took the kids down here with me for a visit to my sister Elsie's farm. Thot a little change of scenery would do us all a world of good after so much trubble and heartache. At least the kids will git a plenty of good home cooking. Your devoted Harry Powell
ICEY SPOON: Now ain't you relieved, Walt?
WALT: Sure, but you was worried too, Mother; takin' off with never a word of goodbye. I even got to figurin' them gypsies busted in and done off with all three of 'em.
ICEY SPOON: You and your gypsies! They been gone a week!
WALT: Not before one of 'em knifed a farmer and stole his horse. Never caught the gypsies nor the horse.
