Online Dating Isn't Really Dating
A common theme I seem to see on here is almost every single person bemoaning their lack of success in dating with posts that start with "we matched on [app name]". That no matter how long they spend on these apps or how many times they tweak their profile or opener that they can't seem to connect with anyone in a meaningful way. Here's why.

Online dating (apps, sites) isn't really dating. It's really just a way to set up meetings between people. Your profile, at the end of the day, is more like a marketing brochure than an actual representation of who you are. Without developing the skills needed to be emotionally in tune with others (particularly strangers), you will find yourself consistently struggling to attract people into your life long term. How does one develop those skills?

By engaging in social activities that create regular social circles where there are people who consistently show up and new people constantly rotating in. Learning how to make friends with strangers is the first step, learning how to gauge signs of interest through invitations and physical escalation rounds out the process. 

Spend less time working on your profile and more time working on your relationships with real humans, and your dating pool and options will flourish.
