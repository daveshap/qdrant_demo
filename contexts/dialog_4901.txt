AARON: How <u>you</u> doing?
TOM: Great. Network news, Washington... I love it. What do you do when your real life exceeds your dreams?
AARON: Keep it to yourself.
TOM: You know the other day I really wanted your reaction to how we did with the Libyan report -- I was going to ask but I guess I feel a little intimidated with you.
AARON: Oh, stop it.
AARON: You can't talk about feeling intimidated when you're on top of the world. It's unseemly.
TOM: I'm not buying into any of that. I have a load to learn. I'm not going to act as if...
AARON: You have the job you have...
TOM: Shut up a second...
AARON: Okay. Pretty petty party, isn't it, pal?
TOM: I made one rule for myself when this started and I realized I was going to take a lot from you people because of being from sports...
AARON: And the rule was...
TOM: Never to pretend to know more than I did.
AARON: Can you name all the members of the Cabinet?
TOM: Okay, let's drop it. I didn't mean I'd take a test for you -- I mean if that came up in conversation I'd...
AARON: We're conversing...Oh my, the names of the entire Cabinet has slipped my mind. What are they?
AARON: Don't name them. Just tell me if you know.
TOM: Yes, Aaron. I know the names of the Cabinet.
AARON: Okay.
TOM: Yes.
AARON: There are only ten.
TOM: You're feeling good, aren't you?
AARON: I'm starting to... We may do the capitols of the states.
TOM: Fifty, right?
