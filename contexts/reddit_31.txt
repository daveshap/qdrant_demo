Am I overthinking?
Im a quiet guy so I don't tend to speak up in certain situations. However I'm dating a girl online, lets call her Jen. She told me on the phone this story as followed:
She was talking to her male friend (lets call him Mark) when another one walked up to her and tried to speak to her. She said, "I'm talking." Which the guy that approached (lets call him Ken) said, "What? Are you gonna f*ck him?". To which Jen replied, "someday".
As someone with trust issues, this hurt a lot. Im writing about this still in the call, not knowing what to say. What should I do?
