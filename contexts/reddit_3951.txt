If someone didn't find you physically attractive, would you rather they be honest?
Or would you rather they lie and say it's something else?

Or would you just prefer they state it in a generic manner, ie "you're not really my type/I don't think we'd make a good match."

I posted these a few days ago, but it was deleted because I forgot a flair.
