Anything I should be careful to be the 1st grad student in a lab?
Hi! I really want to join a lab and I'm rotating in this lab now. The PI is nice, people are nice. The lab has actually started about 10 yrs and the PI didn't have students before only because of some departmental relationship issues. I just feel this lab is the one since I have the excitement of going to the lab every morning after wake up. The only issue I concern is that I'll be the 1st grad student in this lab. Is there any first grad student in a lab who is willing to share some experiences/tips on things that I should be careful about? Thanks!
