I think my boss might fire me unfairly
I’m a supervisor in a shop for context 

My manager called me in for a ‘little chat’ on Saturday and shouted at me for not living up to expectations (targets etc), and essentially said that I haven’t progressed to the standard which she would have expected by now and I don’t understand it. She hinted that she would be letting my go and I’m panicking. I always meet my targets, have never had any issues with customers or other staff members, etc. I leave the store tidy and the tills are always balanced. I don’t understand where this came from. I’m not sure if I should start looking for a new job. Any advice is welcome thanks.
