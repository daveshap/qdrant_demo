I have decided to take a break from dating for an entire year
This year has been pretty awful for me ( F, 24) in terms of dating, and I guess I'm posting this to hold myself accountable. 

I need a break. Dating this year has been better than the last, but it's been emotionally draining, and filled with disappointments. I know what I deserve, but I really do believe that taking a year off will really help center myself and boost my confidence again. I want a relationship-sure. I think in dating this past year however, I have forgotten to focus on myself and who I am. I need to do this for me and my sanity. Here are the things I want to accomplish in 2019. 

&#x200B;

1. Love my body again
2. Spend lots of time with friends and loved ones
3. Get outside more 

I'm sure I'll think of more as the day goes on, but if anyone has done this and can offer some advice, it would be greatly appreciated. 

Edit: Wow I definitely wasnâ€™t expecting so much support! Thanks everyone, it means a lot. Feel free to message me if you wanna join me haha
