I got rejected and it felt great!
So, I was at the mall. I went to this beard salon for dudes. There was a cute girl behind the counter. I ask her some questions about products I've been thinking about. She was cute, funny, and a little sarcastic. So I asked, mid convo, without a lead in, and with another customer within earshot, "hey you want to grab some coffee some time?". She said She'd love to, but her boyfriend probably wouldn't like it. I said it was no biggie and to take care. Then she said, "but thank you, though, I'm  honestly very flattered." Her face even got a little red. I left feeling very good, and apparently it made her day too. Moral of the story: Even a "no" can make you feel really good, and being asked out may make her feel good. If you don't ask the only thing you'll leave with is regret.
