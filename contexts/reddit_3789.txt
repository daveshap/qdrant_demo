My parents never taught me anything about dating. The Internet helped me learn in two months what they could have in years.
Coming from a conservative Christian family, my parents never taught me about dating. They just told me stuff like :

"Boys are of the devil." (So stupid because I have a little brother)

"Go to school, graduate, find a job, get married." (Like it's that easy?!)

I really love my parents, I do, but I hated it that they didn't teach me ACTUAL and PRACTICAL skills on how this is done and I kind of blame them for my failures.

That's why I'm so thankful I found Reddit. Two months ago I was this naive, vulnerable immature woman when it comes to dating.

But after learning after several dates and a break up, I learned a lot.

I also learned soooo much about dating from YouTube and from Reddit and I'm soooo grateful for it.

Truly, this is a learned and applied skill and whatever success we accomplish is the result of hard work.
