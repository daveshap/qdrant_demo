BOBO: How'd you figure you were gonna get away with that?
LILLY: I'm not getting away with anything, Bobo.
BOBO: You're fuckin right you're not. How much did your pals cut you in for on that nag, huh? Or did they give you the same kind of screwing you gave me?
LILLY: I was down on that horse, Bobo. Not as much as I should have been, but there was a lot of action on those--
BOBO: One question. Do you want to stick to that story, or do you want to keep your teeth?
LILLY: I want to keep my teeth.
BOBO: Now I'll ask you another. You think I got no contacts out here? That nag paid off at just the opening price. There wasn't hardly a flutter on the tote board from the time the odds were posted. There ain't enough action to tickle the tote, but you claim a ten grand win! You send me ten thousand dollars, like I'm some mark you can blow off!
LILLY: Bobo, no, I --
BOBO: You wanna talk to me straight up?
LILLY: My son --
BOBO: Your what?
LILLY: My son was in the hospital --
BOBO: What the fuck are you doin with a son?
LILLY: He left home a long time ago. He was in the hospital, up in Los Ang gleez, real sick.
BOBO: Motherhood.
LILLY: I never fucked up before, Bobo.
BOBO: You expect me to buy this?
