GIRL: I can't!
MAN: You know you must. There is only one. Now you are that one. It is time.
GIRL: Why? Why me?
MAN: She has died. You are the next to be called. Why do you think you were sent to me? Trained as you were? You bear the mark.
MAN: The mark of the Coven.
GIRL: I don't understand.
MAN: Ever since Adam and Eve first left the garden, he followed: the serpent. Satan. He sends his legion in the shape of men, to feed on us, to breed his Hell on our earth. They are a plague upon us.
MAN: But as long as there have been vampire, there has been the Coven; the line of Slayers. Ones with the strength and the skill to kill them, to find them where they gather and stop the swell of their numbers. One dies, the next is called.
GIRL: I'm just a girl.
MAN: You are much more.
