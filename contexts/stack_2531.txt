NDVI error over vegetated surfaces and water I performed an NDVI analysis using Qgis 2.18 'Las Palmas' of an area of Landsat 7 (wrs_path 168, wrs_row 061),date 2007-12-25 and Landsat 8 (same path and row) date 2017-12-28.  I clipped both images to x max and x min (36.59588, 36.79113)and y max and y min (-1.29795 and -1.46917).thereafter i used raster calculator to perform the NDVI formula -NDVI=(NIR-RED)/(NIR+RED)for each image,to generate two image outputs,one for 2007 and the other for 2017.The issue is that the NDVI values for vegetation of the 2017 output image are too low, with negative even and shockingly water has a positive value of +1, which is a dam located at latlong (-1.44070, 36.69519).  2007 values were sensible but why this weird values in 2017?
