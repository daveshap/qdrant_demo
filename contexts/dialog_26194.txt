BUFF: Hey, play that demo again, man. Alright.
PONY: Oh, man. Wow. I was never into football, you know?
JEFF: I gotta take a piss. Do you mind if we pull over really quickly?
PONY: Oh, yeah.
JEFF: I'm sorry. I, I gotta...
PONY: Oh, no, no. Uh, uh, George, pull over.
JEFF: Fuck 'em. Fucking assholes.
PONY: Burnfield. No place like it.
SOOZE: Yeah. Burnfield, Pizza and Puke capital of the world.
PONY: I can't believe you're still here.
SOOZE: I'm moving.
PONY: If...
SOOZE: No, I'm going.
PONY: Mm-hm.
SOOZE: Soon.
PONY: Yep.
SOOZE: What's that supposed to mean?
PONY: I don't know. I say what I mean.
SOOZE: Oh, yeah, you're just so smart.
PONY: That's because I am.
ERICA: It's okay. This kind of thing happens. It's just never happened to me. I'm sorry. It's true though. Mm. So, um, what's your TCB tattoo stand for? What's that about?
TIM: Taking care of business.
ERICA: I'm sorry.
SOOZE: I hate it here. It's so ugly, it's like being dead. You got out of here, you know? I'm ready to go.
PONY: Yeah, but sometimes I try to figure out why I left in the first place, you know? I think about people and I wonder what they're doing.
SOOZE: Yeah.
PONY: I think about you. I mean, a lot.
SOOZE: Me?
PONY: Yeah, I have, I have, yeah.
SOOZE: Yeah, you know, when you called I thought, there's a name from the past.
PONY: Or the future, oh, no, no, I mean... I mean, we'll be working on that album cover, right?
SOOZE: Yeah, I know what you're saying.
PONY: You do?
SOOZE: Yeah. God, you showed up at such a weird time in my life.
JEFF: I just walked all the way from Westside to here. I haven't walked that far since junior high. I thought you didn't drink.
BEE-BEE: I don't anymore.
JEFF: Can I have some?
BEE-BEE: Knock yourself out.
JEFF: You know, one moment things are so fucked up than you look at it from a totally different angle and it makes sense.
BEE-BEE: Yeah.
JEFF: Did you ever hear that saying, This too shall pass"?"
BEE-BEE: Sure, all the time, in Group.
JEFF: In Group?
BEE-BEE: Rehab. Outpatient. I have to go once a week. It's kind of like AA.
JEFF: Oh, yeah, you had to go to Highgate. That must've been intense.
BEE-BEE: Intense.
JEFF: How long were you in there?
BEE-BEE: Uh, ninety days. And now I just have to go once a week. See, I'm rehabilitated.
JEFF: Well, you shouldn't drink. Are you gonna drink?
BEE-BEE: No. Oh, maybe. Fuck.
JEFF: I mean, that would suck if you had to go back to rehab.
BEE-BEE: Yeah, it would suck big time. I'd kill myself first.
JEFF: It was pretty bad, huh?
BEE-BEE: It was like hell with windows. You know, there's shit on the walls. Kids my age sucking their thumbs. I mean, every day I would, I'd wake up in my cell and I'd think, my parents put me here. Why? Why? Because I stayed out all night one time. Uh, because I broke the VCR when I was drunk. Because I was out of control. I thought my parents loved me.
