How to keep holding up the world when your arms start to hurt.
So I like to think I’m a pretty good person. I strive to get better every day, and my conscience naturally gives me hell when I go against it.  One of my top reasons to live is even the people around me, and in my mind I could never do enough to return the favor.

I grew up in my life pretty early, so I’m constantly helping my friends with their teen issues.  If someone falls an inch I crawl from my hole of Coke 0 and anime to give them a stool. 

But... for some reason no matter what I do, my friend group keeps getting more negative. From hating themselves to weight disorders, even that hits me deep. I still jump in, but it sucks watering the fire all by myself. 

It’s not like I don’t get any credit... they cling to me pretty tightly.. but if I walk away for a while then they act like I just stabbed them in the back.

I have some home issues myself that drag me down every day, and it just feels like two black holes fighting over my head. It’s bad for my heart. 

I can’t keep doing this forever, but I also can’t turn my back on anyone. It’s immoral and a jerk move. If I don’t keep talking and talking and talking every day, they start to get worse and worse. What can I do...?
