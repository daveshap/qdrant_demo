BELL: Who's Charlie Walser. Oh! Well, I, uh... True story? I couldn't swear to ever detail but... it's certainly true that it is a story.
CARLA JEAN: Yeah, right. Sheriff, can you give me your word on somethin'?
BELL: Yes ma'am?
CARLA JEAN: If I tell you where Llewelyn's headed, you promise it'll be just you goes and talks with him -- you and nobody else?
BELL: Yes ma'am, I do.
CARLA JEAN: Llewelyn would never ask for help. He never thinks he needs any.
BELL: Carla Jean, I will not harm your man. And he needs help, whether he knows it or not.
