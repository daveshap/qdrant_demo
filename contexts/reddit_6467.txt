President of company publicly posting about future flipping of company. Faux pas?
The current (new) president of the company I work at posted on his LinkedIn that he has future plans to sell off the company. N.B., the post isn’t viable to the general public, just those within his LinkedIn network.  

Is this a red flag/business faux pas? As in, sharing private company information semi-publicly? I’m getting kind of nervous here that a president of a company would be so lax sharing this info online.
