VADA: You were just having a fight about me. Wouldn't you like to hear my opinion?
HARRY: Of course.
VADA: I think that if I'm old enough to accept a new baby, and if I'm old enough to accept a new room, I'm old enough to go to California.
HARRY: Honey I know it's fun to think about these things but....
VADA: I already bought a ticket.
HARRY: What??
VADA: I used my own money and got a great deal, it's a Q47NR five day fare, which means that I have to change planes in Dallas and stay over a Saturday.
