Joining the same company as my girlfriend
I am graduating college next week and fortunately have maintained my job offer starting in June despite the pandemic. I was hired following my internship last summer, and I referred my girlfriend of 2 years, who also accepted a job offer with the same company starting in June. Do I need to make any disclosure to HR of our relationship?

Our company is large but privately owned. We will be working in the same headquarters with 2000 employees, but in completely separate divisions and roles. Our work should feature next to zero interaction with each other. My intuition says that it shouldn't be a problem, but this is my first real job and I just want to make sure I'm not making a misstep before I even start.
