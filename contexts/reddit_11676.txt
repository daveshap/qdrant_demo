Break ups are difficult...
So as the name suggests, I've recently broken up with my GF of about 5 months, it doesn't seem long to many probably, but a lot happened in those 5 months, a lot of things happened and I know for a fact i'm still very attached to her, I still love her, but the thing is the break up was quite drawn out so to speak, over the course of about a couple weeks I guess, I mean It's kind of slowly fading, shes removed everything from social media that includes me and is basically walling me off in a metaphorical sense, honestly not even being able to have a conversation seems really depressing for me, i mean the break up was over the fact we argued over small things for the past 3 months, even if we did forget them it still happened, so that was one of the main reasons, another was the fact we had nothing in common except food, I myself think that's not exactly the best reason just because of different interests, but i think the main reason for her was I was indecisive about things (although I was only asking for opinion, or what she wanted to do), as well as the fact we argued, those were the two main things.

Now come a couple days later, I now am not only having small emotion break downs, I'm also having a loss of appetite and I'm only eating a bare minimum, I'm slowly coming to terms with it, but I'm still feeling pretty bad with more questions than answers so, i'm at least trying to have an actual long talk about everything sometime, I'm giving it time though as I do respect her feelings just in case, as although she did send me a small phrase saying that she no longer cares, I'm kind of questioning that a bit, only because she was talking with one particular person, but in the end, I do respect her choice and I am fine with this mutual break up, kind of.

I guess thanks for reading this, I just thought I need to share this as me sharing this is helping me in a way I guess...

Update: To an extent I have gotten over the idea that we have parted ways, but I can't even hold a conversation, I'm experiencing loss of appetite, to an extent where I only eat a few bite of anything before I cannot, I'm slowly beginning to feel more and more fatigued, with everything thing I do to seem tiresome, I feel useless to anything at all, if someone knows anything or how to deal with this, please, I feel like I'm slowly losing myself
