2 months of looking for a job and now struggling.
M - 27, foreigner, living in the UK for the last few years.

Came to the UK a few years ago, worked a temp job for a year, then decided to do a degree here (Business-related degree) and graduated with a First Class. Then right after graduation ended working a year and a half in Finance (entry level job, entirely different area than my degree - just how things turned out to be). 

Decided to leave last December - no career progression, support, lots of stress in the last few months and I just decided to leave without finding a substitution (had managed to save some money for the next few months ahead, for cases like this). I was quite a good employee, everyone was happy with my work, but I wasn't feeling too good internally.

2 months later, registered with most major recruiters, been to 6 interviews (finance roles) and on each, I almost get the job. However, I always get rejected at the last stage and for my last interview, they even told me I was overly qualified for the role. Been thinking - did I shoot myself in the foot by leaving without finding a substitution?

As you can expect, I am really starting to get depressed. Based on what I've shared, do you thing I will be able to find something soon? Is 2 months unemployment already alarming? What am I doing wrong? I always go to the interviews quite confident and prepared.

Many thanks for any potential opinions.
