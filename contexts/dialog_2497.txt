SHADOW: Read.
BRIAN: Trychtichlorate is a binary structured --""
SHADOW: -- Go to the bottom. Under heat properties.
BRIAN: During heat episodes of 2000 Kelvin or higher
SHADOW: Ever burned magnesium? It's so hot it takes water molecules and BAMM!
SHADOW: Son of a bitch tears 'em apart just to eat the oxygen. Wouldn't take much at all to melt ten gauge wire. Problem's burnt magnesium leaves a powder trace -- unless you could find something that would eat its residue.

BRIAN: And the putty around the door?
SHADOW: Even if it was used to seal the air off, that doesn't explain why someone would go to the trouble of a backdraft. A gun's a helluva lot easier

JENNIFER: I could use a date.
BRIAN: Yeah? Well, maybe I can fit it in...
