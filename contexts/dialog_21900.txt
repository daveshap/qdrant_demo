JEFF: Do you suppose it's ethical to watch a man with binoculars, and a long- focus lens -- until you can see the freckles on the back of his neck, and almost read his mail -- do you suppose it's ethical even if you prove he didn't commit a crime?
LISA: I'm not much on rear window ethics.
JEFF: Of course, they have the same chance. They can look at me like a bug under glass, if they want to.
LISA: Jeff -- if anybody walked in here, I don't think they'd believe what they see.
JEFF: Huh?
LISA: You and me with long faces -- plunged into despair -- because we find out that a man didn't kill his wife. We're two of the most frightening ghouls I've ever known.
