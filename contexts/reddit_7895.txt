MSW/MPH student: Thinking about publishing?
Hi all, I’m a first year student thinking about my career, and I’ve made a step in the right direction — presentations at professional conferences — now I am interested in publishing. Any tips? I have a professor interested in collaborating, on a different campus of my university. Thanks!
