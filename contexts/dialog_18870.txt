VADA: I found this.
HARRY: I forgot about that picture, where did you find it?
VADA: In the garage.
HARRY: Ahh, that little Chevy was your mothers favorite car.
VADA: What was my mama like?
HARRY: She was pretty, and kind, she had your eyes. Oh boy did she love to laugh. Sometimes when you laugh, you sound just like her.
VADA: Really?
HARRY: Uh huh. You know what your mother did when she found out she was gonna have you? She came home and painted this whole room pink. She was so sure she was gonna have a little girl.
VADA: Do you miss her?
HARRY: Yes, I did, very much for a long time, and even now, I get a little sad when I think of a pretty flower or a sunset that your mother would have liked.
VADA: I think every time I see a climbing tree i'll think of Thomas J.
HARRY: That's good, memories are good sweetheart. Vada, I'm sorry; I was trying to keep it from you, I just couldn't. You're a good girl, and I want you to be happy; don't be an old grump like me. Seeya in the morning.
