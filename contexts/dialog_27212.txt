MARLON: What're we doing here, Truman?
TRUMAN: This is where it started.
MARLON: What exactly?
TRUMAN: Things. Things that doesn't fit. Maybe I'm being set up for something. You ever feel like that, Marlon? Like your whole life has been building to something?
MARLON: No.
TRUMAN: When you were hauling chickens for Kaiser Poultry, what was the furthest you ever went off the island?
MARLON: I went all over but I never found a place like this. Look at that sunset, Truman. It's perfect.
TRUMAN: Yeah...
MARLON: That's the Big Guy". Quite a paintbrush he's got."
TRUMAN: Just between you and me, Marlon, I'm going away for a while.
MARLON: Really?
TRUMAN: We ought to be getting you back, Mother.
MOTHER: Hold on a minute, dear. Here's us at Mount Rushmore. You remember, Truman--when Dad was still with us - that was quite a drive. You slept all the way there.
TRUMAN: It looks so small.
MOTHER: Things always do--when you look back.
