DUDE: Walter, they're calling the cops, put the piece away.
WALTER: MARK IT ZERO!
SMOKEY: Walter--
WALTER: YOU THINK I'M FUCKING AROUND HERE? MARK IT ZERO!!
SMOKEY: All right! There it is! It's fucking zero!
SMOKEY: You happy, you crazy fuck?
WALTER: This is a league game, Smokey!
DUDE: Walter, you can't do that. These guys're like me, they're pacificists. Smokey was a conscientious objector.
WALTER: You know Dude, I myself dabbled with pacifism at one point. Not in Nam, of course--
DUDE: And you know Smokey has emotional problems!
WALTER: You mean--beyond pacifism?
DUDE: He's fragile, man! He's very fragile!
WALTER: Huh. I did not know that. Well, it's water under the bridge. And we do enter the next round-robin, am I wrong?
DUDE: No, you're not wrong--
WALTER: Am I wrong!
DUDE: You're not wrong, Walter, you're just an asshole.
WALTER: Okay then. We play Quintana and O'Brien next week. They'll be pushovers.
DUDE: Just, just take it easy, Walter.
WALTER: That's your answer to everything, Dude. And let me point out--pacifism is not--look at our current situation with that camelfucker in Iraq-- pacifism is not something to hide behind.
DUDE: Well, just take 't easy, man.
WALTER: I'm perfectly calm, Dude.
DUDE: Yeah? Wavin' a gun around?!
WALTER: Calmer than you are.
