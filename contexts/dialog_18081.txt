ETHAN: I want you out of Australia! ..I don't know how much more plainly I can put it.
NYAH: How do you suggest I go about it?
ETHAN: He's touched your heart. You're overwhelmed. You need to think it over. You'll meet him somewhere in a month. If You're not out in 48 hours I'm coming in and getting you out. Give me the ear piece.
