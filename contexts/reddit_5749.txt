Relocating for a higher quality of life but can't find a job..
I graduated in May and have been looking for a job since. I live in NYC but I want to get out of this state. I don't like the lifestyle here and it's very expensive. I have had interviews in Columbus, OH but nothing concrete and now I am thinking of Raleigh, NC, since I heard very good things about it and liked it when I was there a month ago. However, I have no been successful in the job search at all.

My question is: is it crazy that I am now thinking of just moving there with no job lined up? I really have no source of income or savings right now. I will be relying on my mom for financial assistance. I am hoping that I can at least find a full time retail job once I get there.
