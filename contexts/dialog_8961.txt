EVE: ... I was dreaming ...
ARCHER: Something good?
EVE: We were back in high school. You wanted to join the sky diving team, but I wouldn't let you.
ARCHER: Must've been after we got engaged.
EVE: Actually -- in this dream -- I was your mother.
ARCHER: So you had a nightmare.
EVE: Totally -- you were being very, very bad. You went up in the plane and jumped out. You had a parachute, but it didn't open.
ARCHER: Were you there to catch me?
EVE: No.
ARCHER: How come?
EVE: I don't know ... Maybe because you've never needed my help.
ARCHER: Five years ... I still can't get it out of my head -- an inch to the left, Matty would still be alive.
EVE: And you wouldn't be.
