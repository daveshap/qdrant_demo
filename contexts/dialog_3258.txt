BARBARA: We're trapped in this house forever... with those... people.
ADAM: You can't say that for sure. It could be a transitional thing. Like a post-life crisis. We just have to be tougher with them. Come on. Have some brandy. Spirits, get it?
BARBARA: Death didn't improve your sense of humor.
DELIA: I can't believe that we're eating Cantonese. Is there no Szechuan up here? Hunan?
CHARLES: There's only one Chinese restaurant in town, darling, the owners are Irish and Irish people happen to cook Cantonese. They don't know better.
LYDIA: I plan to have a stroke from the amount of MSG that's in this food.
DELIA: This is our first meal in this house, Lydia. Why don't we all do our little private parts to make it a pleasant one?
CHARLES: Lydia, relax. We'll build you a darkroom in the basement.
LYDIA: My whole life is a darkroom! One ... big... dark... room.
