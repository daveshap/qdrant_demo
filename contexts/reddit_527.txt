I wrote this when I couldn't get sleep. For some reason it gave me a sense of relief when I was able to express myself so explicity. I have just literally pasted the text down below,please do let me know your thoughts about it.BTW I am 19 and I was completely sober while I was writing this.
Ahh fuuuckkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkklkkkkkkkkkkkkkk

Someone fucking help me!!!!!!! 
I can't fucking sleep.
So much of shit going through my mind. 
I fucking hate this college's faculty members,all of them are a bunch of refined assholes. I can't believe its 4 am in the morning and I've been trying to sleep from like 1'o clock.For three hours I can't sleep,holy shit. What is wrong with me???? 
I hate this system, I hate this society and I also hate brutal reality of life. All of them is giving me anxiety. What if I have a back in one of the subjects? , what if I don't have enough money to even support my parents? The fucking truth is I don't want to be like those fucking nerds who think that there is nothing greater than knowledge and are constantly perusing every book in the course in stead of "just chillin". I fucking hate that. Now I know that whatever they are doing right now will get them a better job than me, and its probably going to be them the world will actually give a shit about. Me?  I'm just waiting for life to give me an unexpected turn that might change my fortune, but the truth is that is not going to happen. O god why is this world so depressing ???Why am I sent here??  I think I should stop writing this shit now.....
