My anxiety should have lost me my job, but my boss is amazing.
I've been dealing with an extreme level of anxiety (like shaking in the morning and throwing up about going to work) and also having other neuro symptoms (disassociation episodes at night, abdominal twitching, and needing an MRI). With all the days I couldn't get out of bed or had a doctor's appointments, I should have been fired.

However, my boss has been amazing about this. He's been totally good with the appointments, checking up on me when I've had to see specialists and had to change meds. He see's me not only as an employee, but as a person that is trying their best and stuff is just going down. 

I hope you all get that boss one day.
