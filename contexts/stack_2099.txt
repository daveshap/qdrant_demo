What type of clause is the given sentence? <blockquote>  Is the sentence \"Then the staff assembled the units.\" a dependent or an independent clause?</blockquote>Well, according to me, since there is subordinate conjunction \"Then\" in the sentence with no other sentence, so, therefore, it should be a dependent clause.And also it kinda sounds incomplete when we speak out loud. :)But my book says that its the main clause or independent clause.Any help would be appreciated.
