Those who’ve dealt with it longer than I - how?
So I’m a 20 y.o. F who’s currently on her sophomore year in college. 
I was diagnosed with severe depression and a panic attack disorder about two years ago. 
Since then I’ve dealt with two changes in medication, a suicide attempt and moving away to my own apartment and away from all my family and friends. 
Since starting school I’ve realized I’ve become incredibly isolated. The only time I’ll have human touch is when my boyfriend visits me for the weekend, and unless a professor or a group member speaks to me, generally throughout the day I won’t have a conversation with anyone.  Even my parents don’t talk to me everyday. 
I’ve joined a DnD group and have made attempts to push myself out of this crippling isolation but how do you make friends when more than have your days are bad mental health days? 
My depression has worsened significantly since moving and to help myself I got a 3 month old puppy that I’m training to be my service animal. Honestly, that baby is most of the reason I get out of bed as puppies don’t care if you have depression - they need to be trained. 
I’ve also made another doctors appointment to see about yet another med adjustment. I also got in contact with a therapist but I honestly don’t see how it will help much being as though I can only go to one session a month. 
I just don’t know how I’m supposed to live like this? Like is this going to be my life from now on- just barely struggling by with less than a hand full of people who would actually give a shit if I failed miserably? 
I just need to hear from more experienced depressed individuals- how did you survive?
