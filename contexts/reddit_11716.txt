Thanks r/whatsbotheringyou! (X-post from r/depression)
I just wanted to tell everyone here, thank you for existing. Every single one of you. 

Each OP reminds me that I'm not alone even when I'm not feeling great, and that some people have it worse, so I should be thankful for what I do have, even if it's hard to see some days.

Each commenter reminds me that there are great people out there across this great big world that are willing to take time in their day to go through the new posts in this subreddit and remind people that they matter. To those who PM people, or Skype, or even if it's just a few words of encouragement: It truly makes a difference to those of us who feel so utterly alone to be proven wrong even if it is just for a moment. 

Sometimes I want to delete my r/depression and r/whatsbotheringyou posts because this is my main profile and I don't want everyone to realize how alone and sad I am. Today though, I read through the old comments and they were so touching they made me cry. I'll be keeping them for future reference, when I need them. And I know I'll need them. 

I'm nowhere near being relieved of my loneliness and depression permanently, but at least some things help distract me. This subreddit gives me hope, though, that maybe I'll find myself and make myself whole. And hopefully I'll find wonderful people like you to have near me and be my support so I'm not so lonely anymore.

 I'm trying my best to look up. I hope you are too, whatever situation you might find yourself in. It gets better, I'm told. We won't know until we get there, ne?

TL;DR: Thank you. You matter to me, and you've made my life a little bit brighter.
