STAN: How about we go somewhere else?
CHUCK: Want to see my raft?
STAN: This stinks really bad.
CHUCK: You should have smelled me.
STAN: Cool ropes.
CHUCK: I braided them.
STAN: Must have taken a hell of a long time.
CHUCK: Time I had lots of.
KELLY: What's that?
CHUCK: That's my sea anchor. My second one. Made it out of part of the sail. It keeps you from capsizing in a storm. In theory. And this, this I used to collect water. About half a cup a day.
STAN: You were how long on this?
CHUCK: Forty-three days.
KELLY: All that time I waited to go on a cruise, and you went without me.
CHUCK: Yeah, well...couldn't be helped.
KELLY: What's that, written on the sail?
CHUCK: My epitaph.
