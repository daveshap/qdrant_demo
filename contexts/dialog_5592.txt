GRANDPIERRE: You loved him?
REGGIE: I'm very cold.
GRANDPIERRE: We discovered your husband's body lying next to the tracks of the Paris- Bourdeaux railroad line. He was dressed only in his pajamas. Do you know of any reason why he might have wished to leave France?
REGGIE: Leave?
GRANDPIERRE: Your husband possessed a ticket of passage on the 'Maranguape.' It sailed from Bordeaux for Maracaibo this morning at seven.
REGGIE: I'm very confused.
GRANDPIERRE: He was American?
REGGIE: Swiss.
GRANDPIERRE: Oh. Swiss. His profession?
REGGIE: He didn't have one.
GRANDPIERRE: He was a wealthy man?
REGGIE: I don't know. I suppose so.
GRANDPIERRE: About how wealthy would you say?
REGGIE: I don't know.
GRANDPIERRE: Where did he keep his money?
REGGIE: I don't know.
GRANDPIERRE: Besides yourself, who is his nearest relation?
REGGIE: I don't know.
GRANDPIERRE: C'est absurde, Madame. To-tale-ment absurde!
REGGIE: I know. I'm sorry.
GRANDPIERRE: It is all right.
GRANDPIERRE: Is it all right?
REGGIE: I wish you wouldn't.
