New jobs.
There are a lot of cleaning jobs available in health care right now. We have had to basically double the amount of cleaning hours provided in nursing homes and hospitals.  

No, you will not be swimming in coronavirus. One of my own kids is taking an evening cleaning position at a nursing home.  At least they screen everyone before their shifts and provide surprisingly good PPE. 

My son is an otherwise healthy 18 year old. I have no reason to believe he would be at any more risk if he were not there. Other jobs in the area are not doing daily health screening and are letting people work sick. ( looking at you, local Walmart) 

 They only asked him two questions- Can you piss clean and are you a citizen?
