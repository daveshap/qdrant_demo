Security concerns related to API Key in Website I want to make a weather-forecast website and was planning to make AJAX requests to the openweathermap API to load the weather data.However, I am uncertain on how to properly use the API key. I was going to include the key in a JS script, but I am concerned that the key might be \"stolen\" either from GitHub or the html source.AFAIK the key can only be used to make weather data requests, but it could still be abused to make an inordinate number of requests.Would including the key in the html file be a bad practice? If so, how would I properly implement it?
