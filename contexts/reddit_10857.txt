Why is suicide looked down upon but mental health is often overlooked during the entire buildup?
What's the point of going on when you lost everything? No family anymore, no gf anymore, no joy in life anymore, no pursuit of knowledge, due to depression confiding you to a bed, no bettering of yourself through exercise due to debilitating monotony of earning a paycheck bi-weekly while executives earn 10-100x your salary for your menial work.

I read that Alan Turing, who was a brilliant computer scientist and responsible for saving millions of lives during World War 2, was forced to be chemically castrated for being gay. His hormones got fucked up and took away all joy in his life, his thirst for knowledge, and eventually made him take his own life. Was he weak? No, but defeated, chemically and without purpose.

We're told suicide is selfish. But if it is so selfish, why do people abandon you at your lowest and leave you to deal with what seems insurmountable at the time all alone? Where were they when they proclaimed that suicide is a selfish act when you were going weeks-months in pain trying to fix a mess without any support?

Nobody wants to hear your problems. If you bring them up they will tell you to hopeful things with empty words then disappear for a while. Life's short, you fuck up and are in it alone then good luck. People will always remember your wins, but when you talk about mental health all of a sudden it gets weird and stigmatized. Then you ask yourself am I doing enough, is it worth bringing up, or is the harsh reality that nobody really cares until the decision is made?
