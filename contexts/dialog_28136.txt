LOMBARD: Why did you kill Friedman?
THE ITALIAN: Let me give you a tip, asshole - no one pulls stunts like what you pulled in London and here tonight and hopes to get away with it. It upsets people. It’s wrong. Fucking wrong.
LOMBARD: Why did you kill him?
THE ITALIAN: Huh! You turned him into a liability, didn’t you know?
LOMBARD: Nice way to help a colleague in trouble.
THE ITALIAN: That’s just it. The sonofabitch didn’t ask for help from his colleagues... Testa di cazzo! Hiring some amateur outsiders to fix you... He hasn’t gone to hell too soon... And neither will you, Mr Lamont!
LOMBARD: Are you telling me Friedman didn’t tell you I was here looking for him?
THE ITALIAN: If he had, you’d be dead.
LOMBARD: So why didn’t he?
THE ITALIAN: What do you think, huh?
LOMBARD: I think you’d rather not know what I think.
THE ITALIAN: Huh. Maybe he figured the news our London bureau got a visit from a hitman on behalf of a pissed off client wouldn’t go down too well. He only shared his guilty secret last night. And then only ‘cause he was so fucking edgy after calling his hotel we persuaded him to talk.
LOMBARD: So you killed him and went to clean out his hotel room... How did Friedman say he got to know where to find me?
THE ITALIAN: That’s the beauty. An anonymous call. Makes you wonder how many people know what you’re up to, eh, French-fuck?
LOMBARD: Try again, and this time be polite.
THE ITALIAN: I can only tell you what he told us...
LOMBARD: Not even scum like Friedman would go to the trouble of killing a stranger on the strength of one anonymous call.
THE ITALIAN: Some guy called to let him know the Frenchman who’d called the night before he left London was in L.A. looking to kill him. He did his sums and decided to take the call seriously.
LOMBARD: What sums?
THE ITALIAN: Two stiffs and a missing kid followed your visit to one of the London hotels. He didn’t need your confession...
LOMBARD: You’re sure he said his caller was a man?
THE ITALIAN: That’s what he said...
THE ITALIAN: When they realise I’m missing...
LOMBARD: Shut up and walk...
THE ITALIAN: What you gonna do? Kill me?
LOMBARD: Don’t tempt me. The last scumbag who thought I might kill him died soon afterwards.
THE ITALIAN: Huh. I’m a businessman. What are you, eh?
