BENNY: What's the rush, John Henry?
BASQUIAT: I ain't John Henry.
BENNY: Good.
BASQUIAT: What's your fuckin' problem, anyway?
BENNY: I don't really have any problems.
BASQUIAT: Good. What do you have?
BENNY: What's your fuckin' problem? You get a girlfriend and a little attention and then start acting all uppity with me.
BASQUIAT: 'Uppity?' Like as in 'uppity nigger?'
BENNY: That's not how I meant it. For all you know, you might just be a flash in the pan! You can never tell.
BASQUIAT: Hey fuck you! I deserve this shit. You're just jealous 'cause it ain't happening to you!
