Can federal and state courts in the United States use legal arguments and tests from foreign courts in similar legal systems to inform the development of nascent legal doctrines?
The Commonwealth countries (e.g Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom) developed public interest legal standing doctrines particularly suited for questions regarding environmental degradation and ecological destruction.^[1](http://www.columbiaenvironmentallaw.org/public-interest-standing-and-judicial-review-of-environmental-matters-a-comparative-approach/)  The United States so far lacks liberalized standing doctrine for environmental claims; Jeffery T. Hammons argued that the U.S judicial system and the relevant administrative law statutes are similar enough to warrant developing an American public interest approach to legal standing.^[supra](http://www.columbiaenvironmentallaw.org/public-interest-standing-and-judicial-review-of-environmental-matters-a-comparative-approach/)  Below is Canada's three part test to determine whether or not one has public-interest standing.^[2](http://www.columbiaenvironmentallaw.org/public-interest-standing-and-judicial-review-of-environmental-matters-a-comparative-approach/)*  

>The Standing Trilogy only concerned public interest standing
when the claim raised a constitutional question, but it was
subsequently settled in Finlay that public interest standing is also
available in judicial review of administrative agencies.102 In Finlay,
the court combined the Standing Trilogyâ€™s lessons into the
contemporary three-part test: 
**(1) Is there a justiciable and serious
issue to be tried?  (2) Does the applicant have a genuine interest in
the subject matter? and (3) Is there another reasonable and
effective manner for the case to be brought forward?** The third
prong was elaborated upon in a recent Canadian Supreme Court
case:
[T]he third factor in the public interest standing analysis should be
expressed as: whether the proposed suit is, in all of the
circumstances, a reasonable and effective means of bringing the
matter before the court. This factor, like the other two, must be
assessed in a flexible and purposive manner and weighed in light of
the other factors.

(1) - Does the Supreme Court have the authority to develop a public-interest legal standing doctrine?
