BOBBY: What questions?
TITA: Well, do you -- I mean, have you enjoyed all these... strange things you've been doing?
BOBBY: Sometimes.
BOBBY: Why? Am I some kind of freak to you or something?
TITA: No, no, I don't think that, I'm just curious about it... Do you think I'm a freak?
BOBBY: Sort of.
TITA: Oh no... Why? What is it? The way I look?
BOBBY: No, I don't really think you're a freak.
TITA: I probably am, but I don't care. I mean, I wasn't that blessed to begin with, and when would I have had time to make any improvements...
BOBBY: What about Carl and Catherine? Is he just coaching her, or what?
TITA: Constantly. Night and day. And unless I get up before the birds, I can't get in any practice time for myself...
BOBBY: Uhm hmm.
TITA: Actually, it's very admirable, the way she works. She'll probably be enormously successful, because she's attractive as well, not that that's so important in music, but...
BOBBY: You're attractive, Tita. If you just did a little more with yourself...
TITA: Like what?
BOBBY: Well, if you just maybe did something with your hair, or...
TITA: Oh, let's not talk about my hair, it does what it wants to, and anyway, who cares, I want to talk about you...
BOBBY: There's nothing to say, Tita...
TITA: Well, you're not going to run out on me right away, are you?
BOBBY: I don't know.
