ALEXANDER: How did you know?!
VOX: I can smell carcinogens and industrial pollutants on your skin that have not been known here for -- -- 800,000 years perhaps. Don't keep me in suspense. What year?
ALEXANDER: 1899.
VOX: I must say, you look remarkably good. You don't want a book then?
ALEXANDER: What are you?
VOX: I'm the librarian. I've always been the librarian.

ALEXANDER: Sir... have you a name?
VOX: I am called Vox... ... Now you are Eloi.
