Having a difficult time getting my foot in the door
Hey everyone... I'm wondering if this is the norm for Student Services jobs, or if I should just give up and think about trying another field. I've been applying to advising/admissions/financial aid jobs for years (while working in another field) with no luck. I've had a few interviews, but nothing came out of them although I thought I did well. 

For some background, I am qualified for the positions I apply for, and I'm even overqualified for some. I'm willing to start from the bottom and work my way up. 

Did any of you have a hard time breaking into this field? Any advice?
