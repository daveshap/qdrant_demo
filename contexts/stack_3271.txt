Aliens come to the solar system to speak with our sun 70's era (I think) science fiction story.  Aliens come to the solar system to speak with our sun.  They believe stars are sentient.  First contact story but aliens are not much interested in humanity.  Think the aliens were described as looking similar to small giraffes.
