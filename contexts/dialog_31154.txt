SANDRA: Who is it?
RAY: Detective Duquette, Ms. Van Ryan. Let me in. Now.
RAY: Where is she?
SANDRA: Where she lives. In the guest house. Now will you tell me what this is about?
RAY: I'm placing your daughter under arrest.
SANDRA: You can't...
RAY: Suzie Toller is dead. You don't want Kelly to be next, then take my advice. Stay out of my way.
RAY: I fucked up. I lost control of the situation, the one thing they train you for... God, what did I do?
HUNTER: Just tell us what happened.
RAY: I told Kelly Van Ryan she was under arrest for conspiracy and murder. I did her rights.
