BUDDY: Outside of that.
FOLEY: Doesn't say what she's doing up here, but I don't think it has anything to do with us.
BUDDY: She came up here on her vacation, 'cause she likes shitty weather.
FOLEY: I think she's after Glenn. The girl still with you?
BUDDY: They don't stay the night, Jack, 'less you pay for it.
FOLEY: You tell your sister about it?
BUDDY: Just hung up.
FOLEY: How long you talk to her?
BUDDY: Two hours.
FOLEY: How long were you with the girl?
BUDDY: Forty-five minutes.
FOLEY: You didn't tell your sister about Ripley, did you? 'Cause I don't wanna go through that again.
BUDDY: Forget about my sister. If Karen Sisco's tailing Glenn, we're fucked. Tomorrow night at the fights we all get picked up.
FOLEY: Let's drive by where we're meeting and have a look. Maybe take a look at Ripley's place while we're at it.
