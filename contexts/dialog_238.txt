ELAINE: What am I wanted for?
CATES: I don't answer questions, I ask 'em...
ELAINE: I don't think your gun's loaded...
CATES: This is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. You gotta ask yourself just one question. Are you feelin' lucky?
ELAINE: I still don't think it's loaded.
CATES: Hey, you're right.
ELAINE: You're hopeless.
CATES: That's the way I see it, too.
ELAINE: I'm all wet.
CATES: What's wrong with that?
ELAINE: A guy in the bar called me a dumb bitch today.
CATES: What'd you do?
ELAINE: Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I'd just poured him. Then I tried to deck the sucker.
CATES: I guess he got the message...
ELAINE: Then I sit back and I think, I mean, who's to say I'm not a dumb bitch. I work in a bar, right? I can't read a list of my academic credentials to every booze-hound that comes in the place... You are what you do...
CATES: Positive self-image problem all over again ... You are who you decide you are unless you're the type that lets assholes decide for you.
ELAINE: Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit?
CATES: I do think all psychotherapy is bullshit. But just because I think it's bullshit doesn't mean I don't know something about it.
ELAINE: If this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems, I'll take brutal indifference.
CATES: Hey, you know what I really think?
ELAINE: Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.
CATES: I think you're ashamed to tend bar which is sad because you look great in that outfit they make you wear... You pull down four bills a week which is damn good, and you mix the best Pina Coladas I've ever had... I think that if you need bigger and better things ... then go for em.
