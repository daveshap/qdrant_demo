I'm jumping off a building in a few hours to end my pain.
I never knew the worst case of depression is when tears are no longer flowing in your eyes. Since last month, I've been taking high dosages of antidepressants hidden from everyone but myself. I had no one to rely on, my bestfriend gets mad whenever I speak about my anxieties, saying that she's afraid to be with someone who is mentally and emotionally unstable. I can't speak to my parents about how I feel because they just tell me that "Everybody has problems" and force me to keep going on with the routines I should be doing. I just want to shut down. I have no self-esteem left and I have never felt this way before. This is probably going to be my last reddit post. I left home earlier today ready to do this. I've been told that I'd go to hell when I die, perhaps it's time to go and check it out.
