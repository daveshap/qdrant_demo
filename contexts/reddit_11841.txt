Not sure how to deal with depression
I think I've had problems with depression and social anxiety for much longer than I knew and would want to admit. In May, I mentioned it to my mom and now she uses it against me in arguments. It only makes my problem worse.
I really noticed the problem my senior year of high school and now I'm going into my sophomore year of college and it's only gotten worse. I joined a sorority last year and it helped a lot, but I had to go financially inactive this semester. So not only am I not able to go to events, but my roommates (who are also in my sorority) are always gone and doing things with the sorority. Now I feel twice as alone as before. I turn to alcohol to make me feel better sometimes, and I've had "dark" thoughts. I'm scared of me sometimes.
I've mentioned depression to two of the people closest to me and I don't think they understand that I really am having a hard time. I guess my trying to hide that I'm having any kind of trouble is working. I want to seek help because it's getting really bad lately, but I don't know if anyone will take me seriously. 
How have you guys dealt with depression? 

Edit: Thank you all so much for your support. It has made me start feeling better already. I'm glad that people like y'all are out there. Never stop being awesome!
