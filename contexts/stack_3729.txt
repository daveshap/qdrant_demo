How to calculate sample p (probability of success) for binomial outcome I have a question regarding the binomial distribution. I want to calculate the p from the empirical choices during my treatment in order to calculate the standard deviation for my binomial random values (1,0). I have 240 outcomes (1,0) and I know the mean of this outcome but i am missing p to calculate std.Is there also another way to calculate Std in R instead of using the binomial standard deviation formula? I was thinking of using the estimated variance of a LOGIT model, is that a possibility too?Thank you very much!
