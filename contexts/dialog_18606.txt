DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT: You feel it?
DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD: Yeah.
DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD: Sammy thinks the Caddy had stopped along the shoulder ... man up the road said he saw two cars drag racin'...then you got that blind corner.
DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT: Two men... two guns in the Caddy.
DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD: The boys found this on the floor in back of the Caddy.
DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT: Yeah, they showed me
DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD: Could be unrelated.
DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT: Could be...any of those dead kids wearin' pearl earrings?
DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD: No. Could be someone's missin' maybe.
DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT: That's what I'm thinkin'.
HERB: Why did you want to go to breakfast if you're not hungry?
DAN: I just wanted to come here.
HERB: To Denny's? I wasn't going to say anything, but why Denny's?
DAN: This Denny's.
HERB: Okay. Why this Denny's?
DAN: It's kind of embarrassing but,
HERB: Go ahead.
DAN: I had a dream about this place.
HERB: Oh boy.
DAN: You see what I mean...
HERB: Okay, so you had a dream about this place. Tell me.
DAN: Well ... it's the second one I've had, but they were both the same......they start out that I'm in here but it's not day or night. It's kinda half night, but it looks just like this except for the light, but I'm scared like I can't tell ya. Of all people you're standing right over there by that counter. You're in both dreams and you're scared. I get even more frightened when I see how afraid you are and then I realize what it is - there's a man...in back of this place. He's the one ... he's the one that's doing it. I can see him through the wall. I can see his face and I hope I never see that face ever outside a dream.
HERB: So, you came to see if he's out there?
DAN: To get rid of this god-awful feeling.
HERB: Right then.
