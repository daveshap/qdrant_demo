ELSA: How did you get here?
INDY: Where is it? I want it.
ELSA: You came back for the book? Why?
INDY: My father didn't want it incinerated.
ELSA: Is that what you think of me? I believe in the Grail, not the Swastika.
INDY: Yet you stood up to be counted with the enemy of everything the Grail stands for -- who gives a damn what you think?
ELSA: You do.
INDY: All I have to do is squeeze.
ELSA: All I have to do is scream.
