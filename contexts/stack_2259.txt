Where can I find information of previous Fallout games in Fallout New Vegas? While I was doing the quest \"G.I Blues\" I took the option of passing a test with the missionary guy, and he asked me for the first president of NCR, the original town where the NCR was founded and the flag of the NCR. The last question is pretty obvious cause that flag is everywhere, however the first questions aren't. I had no problem with this test cause I've played Fallout 1 and 2 and I know about the story and lore of the game. But if you have never played any of those games, not even Fallout 3, where can you find information in New Vegas about previous games? I'm asking this cause I have some friends who never played previous games before and they might not understand some things.Maybe I haven't payed enough attention to notes or books in game, but the closest clue I got was while playing the mission where you have to beat an officer form Caesar's legion and the NCR officer says something like \"We can't kill you due to former president Thandi's policies about war prisoners\" Now that was a good hint, but there must be more information elsewhere. Thanks in advance.
