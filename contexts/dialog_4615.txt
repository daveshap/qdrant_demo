VIOLET: Caesar, don't.
CAESAR: What are you going to do, V? Shoot me? Kill me in cold blood? I don't think so. I'll tell you why. If you had it in you to pull that trigger, you would have done it a long time ago. If I was you, I would have killed me the minute I brought the money home. But you didn't and I know why, because you don't want to kill me. Do you, V? Do you? No, I know you don't.
VIOLET: Caesar, you don't know shit.
VIOLET: I will never understand it, Mickey. You didn't even call the police.
MICKEY: I told you, the family doesn't want the police around. We want to take care of it ourselves and we will. I'll find him. I swear I will.
VIOLET: I know you will.
MICKEY: Sure you're going to be okay? I mean, if you're having second thoughts, my offer still stands.
VIOLET: Thanks, Mickey, but I need to get out, you know? Get away from all of this.
