HEROINE: Don't bullshit me! If you know a way out of this place and you're holding out --
BARTENDER: There's a tunnel.
HEROINE: What tunnel? Where?
BARTENDER: It's in the basement, about a hundred yards long. It spits out on the backside of that hill down the way. There's a truck there.
HEROINE: What's it for?
HEROINE: What's it for!?
BOSS MAN: Grass. I grow some pot down there. It's no big deal, just something I dabble in. The truck's for a quick get away, deliveries, whatever.
HEROINE: Is it gassed up?
BOSS MAN: Fully.
HEROINE: Four door?
BOSS MAN: Two.
HEROINE: Open?
BOSS MAN: Covered.
HEROINE: How many?
BOSS MAN: Holds four.
HEROINE: Max?
BOSS MAN: Seven.
HEROINE: Nine?
BOSS MAN: Seven.
HEROINE: Keys.
BOSS MAN: What!? So you can just get the hell outta here and forget about all of us!? No way! That's my god damn truck!
HEROINE: Let me make this clear; if we stay, we die!
BOSS MAN: I don't trust you. No way! I pick who goes! And I'm holding you responsible.
