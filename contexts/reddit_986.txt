Ugh. Posting comments on reddit gives me anxiety 🤦🏻‍♀️
I thought I was being helpful with a comment but just saw I got downvoted -10 and now I feel awful 😑

UPDATE: 
Omg guys waking up to all these upvotes, awards and comments has just completely obliterated all the awfulness I was feeling when I created this post. You are all the actual best 😭
