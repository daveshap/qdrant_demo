JACK: A good day for singing...
GUMP: I've not heard a note out of you.
JACK: Not in the mood, I'm afraid.
GUMP: Listen to him. Not in the mood...
GUMP: On a day like none other the blessed earth has ever seen... A day so fair as forty springtimes --
JACK: I'm not denying it's a joyous day --
GUMP: Where's your joy if you cannot sing?
JACK: Were the Princess Lili to join me I would sing till my lungs burst!
GUMP: She lives... isn't that worth singing about?
JACK: She lives like all the world before the Baron's curse lifted. Now the world's reborn, yet still she sleeps...
