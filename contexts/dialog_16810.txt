DONNIE: I confuse melancholy and depression sometimes....
THURSTON: Mmm.Hmm.
DONNIE: You see?
THURSTON: Why don't you run along now friend, your dessert is getting cold.
DONNIE: I'm sick.
THURSTON: Stay that way.
DONNIE: I'm sick and I'm in love.
THURSTON: You seem the sort of person who confuses the two.
DONNIE: That's right. That's the first time you're right. I CONFUSE THE TWO AND I DON'T CARE.
