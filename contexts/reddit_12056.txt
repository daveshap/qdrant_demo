I don't really know what's wrong with me.
I have feelings of intense sadness and even feelings of contemplating suicide, even though I know I would never go through with it. I could never do that to my parents, they are the most kind hearted and loving people I know. Often I just feel no motivation to do anything. I know this probably doesn't make any sense, but I know that I'm attractive and people who know me tend to like me a lot, but I still feel like I have no confidence. However whenever I feel like I should tell my parents about this or book an appointment with a doctor, my feelings seem to instantly change and I feel like I don't need to, my mood begins to lift and I realize that things aren't that bad, but this is only temporary. I still feel like I should just man up and that my problems aren't so bad, as I'm typing this out I feel like this.

I think a reason for this is that my ex who completely broke my heart is going to the same university as me, I feel paranoid that everywhere  I go I may see her and she'll somehow judge me, but even when we were together I still had feelings of sadness.

One of my closest friends at University's Mother has passed away recently, and I know he relies on me quite a bit to get him through this, but sometimes I just feel completely drained and, as selfish as it sounds, I just don't want to deal with it. I'm just really not sure where my head's at and what I can do about it.   

I'm not great with grammar, sorry.
