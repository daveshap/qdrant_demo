ZACK: Hi, Byron.
BYRON: Zack, you little shit! You haven't changed a bit!
ZACK: Neither have you, pard!
BYRON: Hey, honey, look at this! My son! Isn't he beautiful? You should've called!
ZACK: You were out at sea! Hey, guess what? I graduated. I got my degree.
BYRON: I thought you quit school. Last I heard you were on your way to a construction job or something down in Brazil.
ZACK: Yeah, I made some money down there, then I talked my way into another college and I did it. I wasn't magna cum laude but I did okay. You should've seen me in my cap and gown.
BYRON: Why the fuck didn't you invite me? I would've come.
