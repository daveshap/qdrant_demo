OVERLORD: What's your name?
ALEXANDER: Alexander.
OVERLORD: Well, Alexander, as a fellow scientist I know you have a thousand questions --
ALEXANDER: You came underground when the world was ending above. And you evolved. Some into the Morlocks and others --
OVERLORD: No, we created the Morlocks.
ALEXANDER: Created?
OVERLORD: You wouldn't understand. We genetically engineered the Morlock class to serve our needs.
ALEXANDER: As slaves.
OVERLORD: To work the machines and build the tunnels. You can't imagine what it was like when it all started. We survived for millennia, scraping the lichen and microscopic organisms from the rock with our teeth and digging for water with our nails. Endlessly. For generations. And we... became.
OVERLORD: And centuries later when we tried to emerge into the sun again, we couldn't. Our adaptation was too successful. We survived... we endured... for this.
ALEXANDER: How do you control the Morlocks?
OVERLORD: We make them see what we wish.
ALEXANDER: How?
OVERLORD: As our bodies atrophied our minds... compensated.
ALEXANDER: And what of the Eloi?
OVERLORD: They survived above. Became what they are.
ALEXANDER: No... they didn't survive only to be your food. You did that.
OVERLORD: I'm afraid your indignation is lost here. I have no more human" response to the Eloi then you would have to a carrot. It's just how we live now."
ALEXANDER: But this is barbaric! Have you completely lost all sense of --
OVERLORD: And who are you, Alexander? Who are you to question thousands of years of evolution? This is the world now. I am fact.
ALEXANDER: It can't all be like this...
