Applying for jobs in the past month, no call backs. Should I go back to my old job at a different location?
Stuck in a funk when it comes to getting any callbacks. Have emailed and called establishments asking to speak with a hiring manager for updates but they either: don't pick up the line or don't reply to my messages.

I left my old job because of my coworkers. I should have noticed when I was being promoted and offered raises against people who have been in the business YEARS longer than I have to save myself literal headaches and dread coming to work to leave, but I didn't. I ended up assistant  managing over people who didn't like working, and a manager who didn't like actually disciplining workers because they were "needed" (all of my write ups and disciplinary actions had to be approved by them).

Long story short, I quit, got a new job, and quit that one shortly after. Money and time are really stressing me out the past month and a half.

I still retained all the entry-level experience in the first job and can easily ask for a larger starting pay. I know where I went wrong on my first job, but the thought of everything still repeating itself is starting to put me in a panic attack.
