LOTHOS: What's wrong with you!?!
AMILYN: My arm! He took my fucking arm!
LOTHOS: Shut up! You let him have it!
LOTHOS: You reckless imbecile. This place is ours for the taking and you let yourself... twelve hundred years old and you act like a child.
AMILYN: I had him in my grasp.
LOTHOS: Cheer up. You may still.
AMILYN: I look horrible.
LOTHOS: The other two -- the new ones. Where are they?
AMILYN: I don't know. But the boy, he couldn't kill them.
LOTHOS: No... Not a boy... Find out if they're dead. And do something about that arm. Honestly, I don't know how you made it through the Crusades.
