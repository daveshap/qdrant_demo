Sci-fi movie with highly intelligent humans, the higher ones being very old Around 6 year ago, I watched a sci-fi movie that I would like to watch again. But... Sadly I do not have much to go on.All I can remember is there was this group of highly intelligent humans (possible living in space) that looked after and breed humans to extend their own life...I can remember one of the higher beings, being very old like 200 years old etc... and can remember some group of people finding out about what they were doing.The movie was not vampire- or AI-related.
