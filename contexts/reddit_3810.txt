How to tell if your crush likes you: a guide.
I've read so many posts about "she did this, does that mean she likes me?" or "he texted me this, does that means he likes me?" and the answer is always the same: ask your crush out.  If your crush gives you any variation of "no" (this includes, but is not limited to: ghosting, a non-committed response, saying he/she really likes you as a friend, saying he/she isn't ready for a relationship, etc.) then the answer is no, your crush isn't into you.  If your crush agrees to the date and actually *shows up* to said date, the answer is yes (as long as you don't screw it up on the date).

I understand you want to know beforehand whether your crush likes you or not to avoid rejection.  But you have to realize that even with the infinite wisdom that is reddit there's no guarantee.  There's a chance your crush will say yes, and there's a chance your crush will say no.  There's only one way to find out: ask.
