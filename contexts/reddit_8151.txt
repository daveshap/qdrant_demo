Under what circumstances are children of aliens being separated from their family? What changes are possible within current law or under proposed laws?
According to [this NPR article](https://www.npr.org/2018/06/16/620451012/dhs-nearly-2-000-children-separated-from-adults-at-border-in-six-weeks) "1,995 minors were separated from their "alleged adult guardians" at the southern border in just over a monthlong period", following DOJ's new "[zero tolerance](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2018/06/15/fact-sheet-zero-tolerance-immigration-prosecutions-families)" policy for illegal crossings. In part, the policy states

"The Attorney General directed United States Attorneys on the Southwest Border to prosecute all amenable adults who illegally enter the country, including those accompanied by their children, for 8 U.S.C. ยง 1325(a), illegal entry.

"Children whose parents are referred for prosecution will be placed with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR)."

While the separation of children from their parents has been widely condemned by [people on both sides of the aisle](https://www.dallasnews.com/news/immigration/2018/06/18/beyond-laura-bush-texans-saying-separating-immigrant-children-parents-border), there seems to be considerable disagreement about what is actually happening, and why

[This ](https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/05/illegal-immigration-enforcement-separating-kids-at-border/)article by the National Review claims, in part, that the only children being separated from their parents, are family units who did not seek asylum at the border (crossed illegally) and are being referred for criminal prosecution, a misdemeanor (for first time crossers). If they plead guilty, they and their child are returned to the country of origin. However, in many of these cases, aliens then make an asylum claim, which begins a more lengthy process, where the children continue to be separated from their parents. Per the  Flores Consent Decree of 1997, the government is not allowed to hold unaccompanied children longer than 20 days, and, per a 9th circuit ruling, this includes children held as part of a family unit. The article claims that, historically, family units were released at or before the 20 day limit, pending asylum adjudication, but they often failed to attend their hearing, and remained in the U.S. illegally.

Additionally, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen in a series of [Tweets](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/dhs-secretary-defends-trump-administrations-migrant-policies/ar-AAyMAZ7?OCID=ansmsnnews11), claimed that asylum seekers who sought asylum at a port of entry would not be separated from their children, and/or there is no policy of doing so.

The "zero tolerance" policy supporters, including Attorney General Jeff Sessions, maintain it is necessary to discourage families from putting their children in danger via illegal border crossings, and that "[Orderly and lawful processes are good in themselves and protect the weak and lawful](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/06/16/jeff-sessions-bible-romans-13-trump-immigration-policy/707749002/). "

On the flip side, even if an alien entered the country illegally, they may still file an [asylum claim within one year](https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/refugees-asylum/asylum/questions-and-answers-asylum-eligibility-and-applications). The previously cited NPR source also claims that the ORR is having trouble placing the children, because "the parents are being incarcerated or otherwise held", and the family of these children are unwilling to come forward, out of fear they will be arrested. ORR is currently sharing sponsor information with DHS, further stoking these fears. According to [this](https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/18/politics/immigration-trump-congress-family-separation/index.html) CNN article, the House is currently debating a bill that would overrule the 20 day limit, allowing families to be kept indefinitely at ICE family facilities.

So, to restate the question, under what circumstances are children being separated from their family? What alternatives are available under existing or proposed laws?
