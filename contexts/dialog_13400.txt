EDDIE: Go on back to the hotel.
SARAH: Please, Eddie, don't beg him.
EDDIE: Would you go on back to the hotel? Take a cab, go on back to the hotel.
SARAH: Doesn't all of this come through to you, Eddie? Doesn't any of this mean anything to you? That man, this place, the people. They wear masks, Eddie. And underneath the masks they're perverted, twisted, crippled.
EDDIE: Shut up.
SARAH: Don't wear a mask, Eddie. You don't have to. That's Turk, Eddie, the man who broke your thumbs. Only he's not going to break your thumbs. He'll break your heart, your guts. And for the same reason -- 'cause he hates you, 'cause of what you are. 'Cause of what you have and he hasn't.
EDDIE: Would you get off my back, Sarah? Once and for all, will you get out, will you GET OFF MY BACK?!
