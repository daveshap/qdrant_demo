I don’t know how to change
I’ve had crappy people as friends my whole life. My insecurities control my life. I can have a good time with some people but I think I just get sick of them. I’m about to turn 16 M. I hated every single year of my life in school. I hated school so much that I got admitted to a psychiatric hospital. Now I’m at a smaller school and trying to recover credits. I like to believe I’m usually a really nice guy but I know I have anger issues with others and especially to my self. I don’t have a problem talking to people I don’t know but either I’m not motivated to do so because everything is good for a bit but shit usually always goes south. People make me feel shitty I wish I could spend the rest of my life locked away. Maybe I can have the courage to end it one day but I know my family loves me. Life just feels like complete bs. I understand why people don’t last long around me. If I could leave me I would too. Never dated, was bullied and constantly I get reminded of everything I’m not and everything I haven’t done
Edit: I also have a bad porn addiction because it seems to be the only thing that makes me feel better yet I tell myself to stop but I relapse. I don’t do drugs but I do take prescription meds
