I made it to 15 :)
Before on this subreddit I posted about how I was going to end it all in my birthday before I turned 15. Here I am though. Although my family situation hasn’t gotten a lot better there’s still proof that it’s going to get better over a course of a year or so. Anyways don’t mind this I just feel proud.
