BURBAGE: What do you want, Kit?
MARLOWE: My Massacre at Paris is complete.
BURBAGE: You have the last act?
MARLOWE: You have the money?
BURBAGE: Tomorrow.
MARLOWE: Then tomorrow you will have the pages.
BURBAGE: Wait! Will you desist!
MARLOWE: Twenty pounds on delivery
BURBAGE: What is money to me like us? Besides, if I need a play, I have another waiting, a comedy by Shakespeare.
MARLOWE: Romeo?--he gave it to Henslowe.
BURBAGE: Never!
MARLOWE: Well, I am to Deptford now, I leave my respects, Miss Rosaline.
BURBAGE: I gave Shakespeare two sovereigns for Romeo!
MARLOWE: You did. But Ned Alleyn and the Admiral's Men have the playing of it as the Rose.
BURBAGE: Treachery!
