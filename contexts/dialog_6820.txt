GRANGE: I know your friend, too -- the one that looks like a rock star.
ELLY: I don't know you.
GRANGE: I'd like to get in touch with him.
ELLY: You're not a cop, either. What do you want him for?
GRANGE: I'm looking for a good guitar man.
ELLY: Right.
ELLY: You buying? He kinda wanders around. You'll see him if you pay attention.
GRANGE: I need to find him kind of soon, Elly.
