Is Quebec Bill 62 constitutional?
Quebec's National Assembly voted [today](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-niqab-burka-bill-62-1.4360121) to pass [Bill 62](http://www.assnat.qc.ca/en/travaux-parlementaires/projets-loi/projet-loi-62-41-1.html) which requires that persons receiving services from Quebec government personnel must have their face uncovered.  The law allows accommodations only on the following grounds.

>A personnel member of a body who deals with a request for an
accommodation on religious grounds must make sure that

>(1) the accommodation request results from the application of section 10
of the Charter of human rights and freedoms (chapter C-12);

>(2) the accommodation requested is consistent with the right for equality
between women and men; and

>(3) the accommodation requested does not compromise the principle of
State religious neutrality.

>The accommodation must be reasonable in that it must not impose undue
hardship with regard to, among other considerations, the rights of others, public
health and safety, the effects on the proper operation of the body, and the costs
involved.

>An accommodation may be granted only if the person making the request
has cooperated in seeking a solution that meets the criterion of reasonableness.

News reports have indicated that [constitutional challenges are likely.](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/burqa-niqab-national-assembly-quebec-liberal-government-stephanie-vallee-1.4357463)  In particular at issue would be s. 2a of the [Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_Act,_1982/Part_I) and whether or not Bill 62 would satisfy the [*Oakes* test](https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/117/index.do) if it is found to be incompatible with s. 2a of the Charter.
