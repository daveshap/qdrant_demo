Ubuntu Wireshark Portable on USP I have Ubuntu 16.04 LTS running on my PC. I installed Wireshark and it is working well. The issue is PC RAM which is 4 GB.  After a short while capturing UDP packets the machine gets very slow and, after 30 minutes, the PC will hang and is no longer able to run. I want to install Wireshark on my external hard disk which is 1 TB. There is a portable Wireshark for Windows, which can be installed on any external device connected through USB port; but how can I install a portable Wireshark for Ubuntu?Appreciate if anyone can provide me some useful info. or show me where I can download such a package.
