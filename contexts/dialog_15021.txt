SARAH: So what's your story, Nick?
NICK: I was a cameraman for Nightline for six years, been freelance since '91. Do a lot of work for Greenpeace.
SARAH: That must be interesting. What drew you there?
NICK: Women. 'Bout eighty percent female in Greenpeace.
SARAH: Very noble of you. You don't think you're bringing that thing onto the island, do you?
NICK: Hey, I wouldn't want to spook the woolly mammoths.
SARAH: You think this is all a joke?
NICK: Oh, please. How am I supposed to keep a straight face when -- -- Johnny Cash here tells me I'm going to Skull Island?
SARAH: Ian's a very good friend of mine.
NICK: He doesn't need a friend, he needs a shrink.
SARAH: I believe in him.
