Is anyone else starting to worry more about the financial/economic impact of COVID-19 than about the virus itself?
As a young and relatively healthy individual I'm not worried about contracting the virus, but I am following all CDC and WHO recommendations to prevent transmitting it to those who are more vulnerable. With every passing day I get more and more anxious about the financial and economic crisis that is developing. New reports suggest that this can go on for 12-18 months. I have some huge life events coming up and everything is in flux. What was once solid ground is now complete turmoil.
