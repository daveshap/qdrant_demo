What are marketable skills or courses?
I’m doing a bachelors’ degree in social sciences (cause the market’s boomin’, lol). I’ve got a lot of work experience in customer service and hospitality, offices, and management. 

I’d like to work for a non-profit, the public sector, politics or law, one day. Just hoping to do some good but also make some money. Since my summer jobs fell through I’d like to do some summer classes. Any ideas of skills and courses that are useful once in the job market? Like some type of computer skill? 
Hope this made sense!
Thanks in advance.
