BILL: That old man of his still livin' over there on Clark Street I believe.
WOOLRIDGE: He won't have anything to do with him. Now you say it's all right for him to stay out here in the back?
BILL: Fine with me. If he steals anything, I'll take it out of your pocket anyway.
WOOLRIDGE: He won't steal. I'm tellin' you he's a pretty good ol' boy. Keeps to himself.
BILL: Well, I've got a roomful of work for him to do. Can't get Scooter to do any of it.
WOOLRIDGE: Karl, come over here. I want you to meet your new boss. This is Bill Cox, runs this place. Says you can work here and stay in the back.
BILL: Good to know you, Karl.
KARL: Thank ye.
BILL: Now it's minimal wage and there ain't nothin' but a army cot and a toilet back there.
