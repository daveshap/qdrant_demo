Understanding Employee Turnover w/Logistic Regression I want to understand which factors lead to turnover at my organization using logistic regression. I'm relatively new to this process and have some questions as I prepare the data. I have 4 years of termination and employee data.My independent variables: Age, Title,Department,Tenure @ Company, Start Date, Were they an intern, salary, annual performance rating, # of employee events attended, distance from officeDependent variable: Did they terminate Y/N (1/0)Questions:How do I deal with independent variables that changed in the 4 year window? For some employees, I will have 4 \"records\" - one for each year. For example: salary, performance rating. Do I just simply take the most recent record, or do I keep all 4?  How do I deal with people who terminated for reasons like retirement or deceased? Remove them from the model? Keep them in and set them to not terminated?There are many, many titles in the organization. I'm assuming I should collapse these into smaller groups and isolate each as a dummy variable (i.e. 0 if not director/1 if director; 0 if not manager/1 if director).
