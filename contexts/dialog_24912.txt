SHEILA: Theo, Buzz is dead.
THEO: I didn't come this far to bury a guy that's not my dad. He owes me.
SHEILA: Back to plan A. The vicious cycle all over again. Theo lets go of Sheila.
SHEILA: I've been trapped by Miles Kastle my whole life. She walks over to her scooter, and mounts it.
SHEILA: Now he's the one who's locked up and I'm the one who's free. If I gotta do this alone, I might as well start now. She revs up and peals out.
THEO: SSHHEEIILLAAA!
THEO: Why is Junior's watch in that coffin? Something stinks around here.
SID: Your time is up, busyboy.
THEO: Who identified the body?
SID: The body was identified along proper Bowling Congress guidelines for processing a bowling related fatality.
THEO: I'm the next of kin. I should've seen him.
BREEZE: After we ID, we bury the body. Case and casket closed.
THEO: You tried to make it look like Junior trashed his place. Junior's underground in that coffin you dicks put him in.
BREEZE: It's splitsville for you.
THEO: You faked my dad's murder. You used him! Where is he! Theo chases Sid and Breeze around their car. He catches Sid and grabs the middle fingers on his right hand. Sid howls.
SID: Ow! Ooh! No, please! Doc said I'd be back on the planks in a week! Show him Breeze! Breeze pulls a copy of New York Bowler" from his pocket. The headline reads "RUB OUT!:BOWLING LEGEND KACKED BY DWARFSCAM KINGPIN" with a photo of Buzz Fazeli."
