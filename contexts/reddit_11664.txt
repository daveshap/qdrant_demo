I try to be a good person but I'll never be enough
I feel like my life is just a series of huge mistakes that result from my character flaws. The first was from jealousy, the most recent from uncertainty/fear of commitment/being unconfrontational. I don't deserve my wonderful, beautiful, pure boyfriend for so many reasons. Even after I make these huge mistakes I do learn from them, but then another big one will come along in a totally different field. I already hurt my boyfriend with my most recent one and I'm afraid I'm going to hurt him again. He keeps telling me that it's okay, that he loves me, that I deserve him, but I'm so scared. I can't afford to fuck up again. I really try so hard to be a good person. All I want is to be worthy of him. I want to be kind enough, funny enough, smart enough, but overall just good enough. He has never sparked these insecurities himself but I am just so afraid of losing him. God I love him with all my heart and I never want to wrong him.I hate hate hate myself so much. I feel like I'm barely worthy of living. Plus I'm ugly and getting fatter by the day so there's that too.
