Question on getting referrals
So I'm doing my BA degree and I really want to get into SAS for an internship(I live near their headquarters). It hasn't been going great so far(getting interviews but getting rejected afterwards). One of my professors worked with SAS for about 30 years with their leadership team. So I'm thinking of maybe asking her in an indirect way of maybe putting in a good word for me? Something like, "Do you know whether SAS hires a lot of people from the university(the university I'm at)." Would it be okay to do this?

Thanks for any input!
