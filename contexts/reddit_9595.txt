Interested in student affairs, but worried about my introverted nature and (mild) social anxiety.
Hi everyone,

I'm not sure how active this sub is still, but I am interested in pursuing a master's degree in student affairs/higher ed administration. Currently I work in a university as a publicist and webmaster for a department. I've realized I really like the higher ed environment but I'm not exactly sure where I ultimately want to fit in, so my mind is on the master's program in higher ed my university offers.

Anyway, I really like the idea of academic advising, but I'm worried about not being personable or relate-able enough, if that makes sense. I'm an INTJ and I take a daily medication for anxiety/depression, but I have been happy and stable for years. I'm totally fine interacting with people and I consider myself easygoing and friendly, but part of me feels like an academic advisor needs to be a sort of counselor that can relate to students, empathize with them, etc., whereas I tend to be more...reserved and analytical?

This is sort of a ramble, but what are your thoughts on working in student affairs as an introvert with mild anxiety (but not debilitating).
