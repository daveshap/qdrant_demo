CHARLIE: It's all there. Both nights.
FRANK: What're you saying, Charlie?
CHARLIE: Look, Frankie. You and Jack been playing here, a long time.
FRANK: Twelve years.
CHARLIE: Right, twelve years. Couple times a month.
FRANK: So?
CHARLIE: So maybe it's time we took a vacation from each other.
FRANK: Vacation? Christ, Charlie, it's a Monday night. You said so yourself.
CHARLIE: It wasn't half full out there tonight, Frankie. I got six waiters standing in back listening to baseball. I gotta move the liquor. To move the liquor, I gotta fill the tables. It's a matter of economics. Me, I love you. I love both you guys, you know that. You're class. But people today. They don't know class if it walks up and grabs 'em by the balls.
JACK: What's with Charlie?
FRANK: Nothing. Everything's great. Terrific.
JACK: Yeah?
FRANK: It's me.
JACK: Frank?
FRANK: Yeah. Listen ... come out to the house tomorrow, will ya?
JACK: I've had enough family for one month, Frank.
FRANK: It's not family. It's business.
JACK: So talk to me tomorrow. After the gig.
FRANK: We don't get a gig.
JACK: What're you talking about?
FRANK: Something came up. Don't worry, Charlie stayed true. Both nights. I'll give you your share tomorrow. At the house.
FRANK: So you'll come out, right?
JACK: Yeah, okay.
