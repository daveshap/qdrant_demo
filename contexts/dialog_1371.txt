JESSE: Distracting enough for you?
FRANK: Pff. They hardly even noticed you.
JESSE: So you're saying I could have done more to attract their attention.
FRANK: Mm-hmm.
JESSE: Such as?
FRANK: You could have worn one of those big, floppy woman's Easter Sunday hats.
JESSE: That would have made an impression.
FRANK: I figure.
JESSE: See, that's your problem, Frank. By the time you finish figuring out stuff, I'm already finished doing it.
FRANK: No, Jesse, your problem is you're always doing stuff before I'm finished figuring it out.
COLE: Wait'll we get back to Missouri, start telling those gals about how little Jesse James charged the whole Union Army by himself!
COMANCHE TOM: You ride like a Comanche.
BOB: You can ride like that?
COMANCHE TOM: I said like a Comanche, not this Comanche.
COLE: Ride with me, cousin?
JESSE: I could use the walk.
COLE: Suit yourself. We'll have some horses waiting for you at the road. Let's ride, Rangers!
