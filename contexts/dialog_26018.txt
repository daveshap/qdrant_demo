MIKEY: Dad?…Do you think that Brady will ever get better?
MARTY: One in a million recover.
MIKEY: Maybe he's that one in a million!
MARTY: Mikey, there's optimism, and then there's stupidity. It's a very fine line.
MIKEY: I don't think there's any hope, either. I was just trying to make you feel better.
MARTY: Thanks.
MIKEY: You're welcome. Dad?…Would you let me try hypnotizing you now?
MARTY: Yeah. Sure Go ahead. Hypnotize me.
MIKEY: OK. Stay there. I'll be right back.
