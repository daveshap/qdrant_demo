ASHBY: Oh. Well, thanks for the drink.
LILY: You're welcome. I was just going to ask you if you'd like to join us.
JAKE: She got one leg out from under him. Now we had to lean.
GORDO: So then Miles walks straight into the Creative Director's office and says The code's fine
JAKE: So this is our boss, right? He chases me and Miles out of his office and he's yelling and screaming, You're fired! Your whole team's fired!" He starts looking for Lily
MILES: But the best part was that he couldn't find Gordo! He was in the bathroom. So he finally goes in there, kicks in a stall door and starts yelling! And there's Gordo, pants at the ankles, holding a PC World Magazine!
