MACFARLANE: I will not have you use that name to me.
GRAY: You will not have it?
FETTES: Dr. MacFarlane -- you remember the lady who came to see you yesterday -- the lady with the little girl?
MACFARLANE: I remember her.
FETTES: She came again today. She wanted me to ask you if you would not break your rule and operate. She feels you are her only hope.
MACFARLANE: So she told me. I'm a teacher -- not a practitioner.
GRAY: You're a teacher, eh? Maybe you're afraid to be a doctor, Toddy.
MACFARLANE: Afraid of what?
GRAY: Afraid you are not as good a doctor perhaps as you make out to be.
MACFARLANE: I am the best man for the job.
GRAY: Why don't you do it then?
MACFARLANE: You? Why? Since when have you become the protector of little children?
GRAY: I'm not concerned about the child, Toddy. It's you I'm thinking of, I'd like to see you prove that a lot of things I know haven't hurt Toddy MacFarlane any.
MACFARLANE: I'll not do it, Gray.
GRAY: Oh, yes, you will. You'll do it to oblige Fettes and myself.
MACFARLANE: No.
GRAY: Maybe there's some private reason between you and me which will make you -- some long lost friend of ours. Say that you'll do it for me and my friend, Mr. Fettes, here.
MACFARLANE: It might be an interesting case.
GRAY: That's a good boy, Toddy.
