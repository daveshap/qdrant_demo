MAROON: How much do you know about show business, Valiant?
VALIANT: Only there's no business like it, no business I know.
MAROON: Yeah, and there's no business as expensive. I'm twenty-five grand over budget on the latest Bunnysitter cartoon and it's all because that rabbit can't keep his mind on his work. And you know why?
VALIANT: One too many safes dropped on his head?
MAROON: Nah, that goes with the territory. He's a stunt bunny.
MAROON: Here's the problem... Seen cooing over calamari with notsonew Sugar Daddy was Jessica Rabbit... wife of Maroon star
VALIANT: So what do you want me to do?
MAROON: Get me a couple juicy pictures. Somethin' I can wise the rabbit up with.
VALIANT: I don't work in Toontown.
MAROON: You don't have to. The rabbit's wife sings at an underground Toon revue joint called The Ink & Paint Club. You can catch her in action there.
VALIANT: The job's gonna cost you a hundred bucks.
MAROON: A hundred bucks? That's ridiculous.
VALIANT: So's the job.
