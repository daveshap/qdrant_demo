ROBIN: I called everyone, everywhere! You just vanished! You could be dead!
GEORGE: Thanks for waking me up. Picking me up. You're loud today.
ROBIN: You're inconsiderate and absolutely devoid of emotion!
GEORGE: You're the most beautiful woman I have ever known in my life.
ROBIN: What?
GEORGE: I'm not talking just physically. Even your anger is perfect.
GEORGE: I didn't think you'd know I went missing.
ROBIN: You didn't think someone from your office would call and tell me you wrecked the entire building and threatened people with a baseball bat?!
GEORGE: A blueprint spool.
ROBIN: Where have you been for a week?!
GEORGE: Four days. I left to think.
ROBIN: What did you do with your dog?
GEORGE: Kurt's been feeding him.
ROBIN: But you can't call me while you think?
GEORGE: I wasn't thinking. Look, I'm sorry I didn't think to call you while I thought...I think.
GEORGE: I need to talk to you.
ROBIN: Why would they tow your truck?
GEORGE: I was parked in day parking.
ROBIN: Why call me?
GEORGE: I'm going to tear down the shack and build my house.
ROBIN: You've been saying that for twenty years. While we were dating, you said it.
GEORGE: There's nothing anymore to stop me.
ROBIN: Money?
GEORGE: Severance pay. And I'm going to cash in my life insurance policy.
ROBIN: How many years did I live with your beams and boards? First in the garage, then in the living room. We're going to do it, Robin. Next year. Next year. Salvaged floorboards from a house in Pasadena. Doors from a church in New Hampshire...
GEORGE: I love those doors.
ROBIN: Where will you live?
GEORGE: The garage.
ROBIN: Look, I wasn't serious about you taking Sam, so you don't have to get into any actual construction to get out of it.
GEORGE: When's school over?
ROBIN: Friday...God, I hate the thought of him home all day.
GEORGE: I'll be by Saturday to pick him up.
ROBIN: He doesn't want to spend the weekends with you anymore.
GEORGE: Not for the weekend. For the summer.
ROBIN: You and Sam are going to live in a garage without plumbing for the summer?
GEORGE: The garage is plumbed. I'll put in a toilet. We'll survive.
ROBIN: Thank you for at least sounding sincere.
GEORGE: Sounding? I need help. He's cheap labor.
ROBIN: One of you would end up dead.
GEORGE: At least we'll have a house to show for it.
ROBIN: Forget it, really. I'll survive.
GEORGE: I want him with me.
ROBIN: No, you don't. Trust me.
