HELLER: We're recruiting.
HENRYK: Who's recruiting?
HELLER: Don't be clever with me, Henryk. I've come here as a friend. They're bringing Jews in from all over the country. Soon there'll be half a million people in the ghetto. We need more Jewish police...
HENRYK: Oh? More Jewish police? You mean you want me to wear a cap like yours, beat up Jews with my truncheon and catch the Gestapo spirit. I see!
HELLER: Someone's got to do it, Henryk.
HENRYK: But why me? I thought you only recruited boys with rich fathers. Look at my father, look at us, I mean...
HELLER: Yes, I'm looking at you and that's why I'm here. Your whole family can have a better life. You want to go on struggling for survival, selling books on the street?
HENRYK: Yes, please.
HELLER: I'm doing you people a favour. And what about you, Wladek? You're a great pianist. And we've got an excellent police jazz band. They'd welcome you with open arms. Join us. You've got no work...
