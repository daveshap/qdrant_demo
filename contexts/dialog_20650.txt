CHARLIE: There isn't a girl in school that can hold a candle to you..
PEGGY: You're pretty charming when you want to be.
CHARLIE: Yeah I know. But I don't have to flatter you. It just feels right. You're the perfect girl for me. As in is, was and always will be. I'm glad dancing was invented. You know the first dances were rituals. Like fertility rites.
DOLORES: Hey Terry, what is that? Did Peggy make it up? I've never seen that on Bandstand.
TERRY: What if we're witnessing the end of touch dancing?
PEGGY: Mmm. This is nice. I always loved the way you kiss. I missed you.
CHARLIE: Your eyes look like silver pools of moonlight. And the tide rushes in.
PEGGY: You really love me, don't you?
CHARLIE: You know I do. I even wrote you into my will.
PEGGY: Charlie, let's make love.
CHARLIE: What?! You mean sex?! Intercourse? You want to have intercourse! Last weekend you said... What time is it?
PEGGY: A lot's happened since last weekend.
CHARLIE: But you're the one who wanted to wait till we got married. And you were right. We should wait.
PEGGY: I probably meant it when I said it. Doesn't Lucky Chuckie want to come out?
CHARLIE: Who?
PEGGY: You know. Your love machine... the throbbing thrill hammer... your thing!
CHARLIE: You mean my wang? Listen, it's running real late.
