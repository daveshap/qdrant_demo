SAM: I always wondered what you Mayors do when you're not cutting ribbons.
HOLLIS: Sam! Hey podner! You caught me playing hooky--
SAM: Floating around out here, playin' hell with them bass--play a little cards, play a little golf, drink some beer--
HOLLIS: Sounds great. Where do I sign up?
SAM: I haven't been out here for a while.
HOLLIS: You go by your old house?
SAM: No.
HOLLIS: Just as well. The new people just painted it some God-awful color--
SAM: We found a body out by the Army base yesterday. Been there for a long time.
HOLLIS: Was it Davy Crockett or Jim Bowie?
SAM: You recall if Charley Wade was a Mason?
HOLLIS: Charley? I believe he was. Used to go for lodge meetings over to Laredo. What's he got to do with your body?
SAM: All it was wearing was a big old Masonic ring and a Rio County Sheriffs badge.
SAM: You don't remember anything else from that last night you saw him, do you?
HOLLIS: I told the story enough times--hell, we were just in the car, he was stewing about the fight with Buddy while we drove over to Roderick Bledsoe's--
SAM: Bledso
HOLLIS: He owned the colored roadhouse before Big O--
SAM: He still living?
HOLLIS: No. I think his widow's still in their place in Darktown, though. You think it's Charley Wade, huh?
SAM: Forensics people are sure of it. You have any idea who might have put him there?
SAM: Besides my father, I mean.
HOLLIS: There's no call for that, Sam. Fella made himself a pile of enemies over the years.
SAM: And Buddy was one of them.
HOLLIS: We got that dedication tomorrow. This is a hell of a time to be draggin' up old business.
SAM: People have worked this whole big thing up around my father. If it's built on a crime, they deserve to know. Now I understand why you might want to believe he couldn't do it.
HOLLIS: And I understand why you might want to think he could.
