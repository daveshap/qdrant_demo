JEANETTE: He had girlfriends!
ED: He says --
JEANETTE: I don't care what he says. Look, I don't need to relive this. On television!
AL: Whatever happened to Norman Rockwell?
ED: Who?
AL: Norman Rockwell. He painted magazine covers. Folksy. A mailman, a boy scout, a kid visiting a doctor...
ED: Yeah, so... ?
AL: They celebrated the common person.
ED: Well, I don't think you can get more common than me, Al.
AL: No. Only celebrities now. Now, if you put a mailman on the cover of a magazine he'd better have killed someone or no one will buy it. This one to Dr. Rumpley.
JEANETTE: All right -- do you want to know the truth? I took you and Marcia and Ray to my sister's on the train for the weekend and you all got chicken pox. So I took you home a day early and there was your father with a woman in our bed. Okay?
ED: Chicken pox? I was six. He didn't leave 'til I was twelve.
JEANETTE: He... apologized, he begged me. He can be very... charming when it suits his purpose.
ED: But what was that whole story about him and a nurse?
JEANETTE: She could've been a nurse.
ED: Could've been a nurse?
JEANETTE: She had white shoes.
ED: So does Grandma. So does Shaquille O'Neal. You told me you had a hysterectomy and he ran off with your nurse.
JEANETTE: What's the difference?
ED: The difference is for twenty years I thought one thing and now it's another thing.
