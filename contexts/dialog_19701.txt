BULJANOFF: It is, Ninotchka! It is! He must have been in Paris! You can see it in his whole attitude! He just picked up a crumb of our black bread, shook his head, and dropped it.
KOPALSKI: If you asked him why he left France I bet he couldn't name one good reason.
BULJANOFF: I should be a swallow! Right now I would be sitting in front of the Caf√© de Paris picking up flakes of French pastry that would melt in my bill.
NINOTCHKA: Now, comrades... there is something better in life than crumbs of French pastry.
KOPALSKI: Yes, a good piece of apfel strudel....
NINOTCHKA: We will get that... we'll get everything... maybe a little bit later but we'll get it... We must be patient... Finally we got the spring, didn't we? We got the swallows, and you will get your apfel strudel too.
BULJANOFF: And if it is too late for you your children will eat it.
IRANOFF: Let's forget the future... let's stop being sentimental... let's start that omelet.
