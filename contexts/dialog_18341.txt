LAUNCELOT: At last! A call! A cry of distress ... Concorde! Brave, Concorde ... you shall not have died in vain!
CONCORDE: I'm not quite dead, sir ...
LAUNCELOT: Oh, well ... er brave Concorde! You shall not have been fatally wounded in vain!
CONCORDE: I think I could pull through, sir.
LAUNCELOT: Good Concorde ... stay here and rest awhile.
CONCORDE: I think I'll be all right to come with you, sir.
LAUNCELOT: I will send help, brave friend, as soon as I have accomplished this most daring, desperate adventure in this genre.
CONCORDE: Really, I feel fine, sir.
LAUNCELOT: Farewell, Concorde!
CONCORDE: It just seems silly ... me lying here.
