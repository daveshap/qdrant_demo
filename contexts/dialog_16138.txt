SAM: I took some of your Vicodin.
GEORGE: I know. Why?
SAM: I like how it feels not to feel.
GEORGE: I know the feeling.
SAM: How do you become something you're not?
GEORGE: What would you like to be?
SAM: What I'm not.
GEORGE: What are you now?
SAM: Nothing.
GEORGE: That's not true.
SAM: See, that's the thing...I am what I say I am.
GEORGE: I know parts of who you are.
SAM: What do you know about me?
GEORGE: When you started first grade and your mom went to work, it was so she could save for an apartment. But then she met Peter and skipped the idea of renting.
SAM: He's got nothing to do with me.
GEORGE: I couldn't imagine how I could compete with him for any part of you. So, I didn't. He wanted you to have his last name...I let him even take that.
SAM: He was a prick when I was six, and he's a prick today.
GEORGE: I wish you had told me then.
SAM: I'm telling you now.
GEORGE: I gave up on you.
SAM: I'd be in Tahoe having fun if you had given up.
GEORGE: What would you be doing now?
SAM: Getting high, I guess.
GEORGE: If I asked you to stop, would you?
SAM: I haven't used anything for two days. I'm trying.
GEORGE: I'm proud of you, Sam.
SAM: Don't be. And hide whatever that new drug is you have. I like it.
