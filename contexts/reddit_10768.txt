Bye ♡
This is a goodbye to all of the people here, specially every one that I talked to.

You were all so kind and lovely to me. Thank you for each one of you that cared, that messaged me, that tried to help. You are all so nice. All of the things you wtote to me meant the world.
You made me feel better in bad moments and made me feel loved and real a lot of times. I'm really thankful.

To the kind and lovely people that I talk here, I love you all so much. You are so important to me. Thank you for making my days better and for giving me good moments. You made it easier for me to live here. 
I'm sorry that I couldn't tell bye to each of you, it would just worry you more. 
Just please, know that you matter the world and I want all of you to be happy.

If you are reading this, whoever you are, thank you, too. I know things are hard. I don't know your pain, but I know it will get better. Things change everytime, maybe for better. Don't give up on trying. 
You are all so, so strong. You will be fine. 

I hope you can feel fine and happier with time. I'm sending you a big hug and lots of love. Always remember that there's someone who cares. 

I'm sorry if I'm hurting you with this. I'll be fine now. I'll be in peace. I hope you can find peace here on earth. It just wasn't possible to me, but it can be to you.

I love you. Thank you for reading, if you did. ♡
