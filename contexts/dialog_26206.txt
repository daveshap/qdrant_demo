NAZEER: Look, get down off my property.
TIM: Why? What are you gonna do? Huh? You're gonna shoot me for standing on your fucking trash can?
NAZEER: Get off my property!
TIM: Hey, you know what? Go fuck yourself.
NAZEER: Fuck you! You know, I'll call the police.
TIM: Go ahead! They love you just about as much as I do.
JEFF: Tim, can we go? This is ridiculous.
TIM: Hey, Ma, look at me! Top of the world, Ma!
