KANE: I've just made a shocking discovery. The Enquirer" is without a telephone. Have two installed at once!"
BERNSTEIN: I ordered six already this morning! Got a discount!
CARTER: But, Mr. Kane -
KANE: That'll be all today, Mr. Carter. You've been most understanding. Good day, Mr. Carter!
LELAND: Poor Mr. Carter!
KANE: What makes those fellows think that a newspaper is something rigid, something inflexible, that people are supposed to pay two cents for -
BERNSTEIN: Three cents.
KANE: Two cents.
BERNSTEIN: This is all figured at three cents a copy.
KANE: Re-figure it, Mr. Bernstein, at two cents.
BERNSTEIN: All right, but I'll keep these figures, too, just in case.
KANE: Ready for dinner, Brad?
BERNSTEIN: Mr. Leland, if Mr. Kane, he should decide to drop the price to one cent, or maybe even he should make up his mind to give the paper away with a half-pound of tea - you'll just hold him until I get back, won't you?
LELAND: I'm not guaranteeing a thing, Mr. Bernstein. You people work too fast for me! Talk about new brooms!
BERNSTEIN: Who said anything about brooms?
KANE: It's a saying, Mr. Bernstein. A new broom sweeps clean.
BERNSTEIN: Oh!
