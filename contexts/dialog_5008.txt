BENNY: Hey! She wasted my dog!
PIKE: Bummer metaphor.
BENNY: Rich bitches. They're a plague. They've gotta be stopped.
PIKE: You didn't like them.
BENNY: They're all the same! They're so stuck up, they're just... they're not even human. I hate them.
PIKE: Would you sleep with them?
BENNY: Yes. Definitely. Definitely. Please, God.
PIKE: Well, there it is, isn't it? You don't even like them, and you'd sleep with them. What's that all about?
BENNY: I got a news flash, man, another shot of this and I'll have sex with you.
PIKE: Oh, yeah, and then you'll never call me.
NICOLE: Come one, that was so weird.
BUFFY: What, it's not weird. I just cut the stupid hot dog in half.
KIMBERLY: I can't believe they still ate it.
JENNIFER: Where'd you learn how to do that?
BUFFY: I didn't learn... I just... it's not a big deal.
KIMBERLY: Buffy, I'm gonna tell Jeffrey you were playing with another man's Hebrew National.
BUFFY: Get a boob job.
