PERRY: Don't mind about me. But could you do me a favor and clear her place and take away all evidence of her, and bring me a big glass of vodka?
SHY WAITER: Absolutely!
PERRY: I'm sorry if we disturbed you.
ROSE: I'm not disturbed. By you.
PERRY: My lady friend has a personality disorder.
ROSE: She was just too young for you.
PERRY: Thanks, comrade.
SHY WAITER: It's nothing!
PERRY: Ouch. Too young! I just got that. You know how to hurt guy. How old are you?
ROSE: None of your business.
PERRY: Sorry. That was rude.
ROSE: Will you join me for dinner?
PERRY: Are you sure?
PERRY: Then I'd be delighted. I hate eating alone, and it's amazing how often I end up doing just that.
ROSE: What do you do?
PERRY: I'm a professor. I teach communications at N.Y.U.
ROSE: That woman was a student of yours?
PERRY: Sheila? Yes she was. Is. Was.
ROSE: There's old saying my mother told me. Would you like to hear it?
PERRY: Yes.
ROSE: Don't shit where you eat.
PERRY: I'll remember that. What do you do?
ROSE: I'm a housewife.
PERRY: Then why are you eating alone?
ROSE: I'm not eating alone. Can I ask you a question?
PERRY: Go ahead.
ROSE: Why do men chase women?
PERRY: Nerves.
ROSE: I think it's because they fear death.
PERRY: Maybe. Listen. You wanna know why I chase women? I find women charming.
PERRY: I teach these classes I've taught for a million years. The spontaneity went out of it for me a long time ago. I started off, I was excited about something and I wanted to share it. Now it's rote, it's the multiplication table. Except sometimes. Sometimes I'm droning along and I look up, and there's this fresh young beautiful face, and it's all new to her and I'm this great guy who's just brilliant and thinks out loud. And when that happens, when I look out among those chairs and look at a young woman's face, and see me there in her eyes, me the way I always wanted to be and maybe once was, then I ask her out on a date. It doesn't last. It can go for a few weeks or a couple of precious months, but then she catches on that I'm just a burnt out old gasbag and that she's as fresh and bright and full of promise as moonlight in a martini. And at that moment, she stands up and throws a glass of water in my face, or some action to that effect.
ROSE: What you don't know about women is a lot.
LORETTA: They get some turnout for this stuff.
RONNY: It's the best thing there is.
LORETTA: I like parts of it, but I don't really get it.
MONA: You haven't once said you like my dress.
COSMO: I like your dress. It's very bright.
MONA: Why you looking around so much?
COSMO: I don't know. I got a feeling.
MONA: I'm wearing your bracelet.
PERRY: May I walk with you a ways?
ROSE: Sure.
PERRY: You knew that man?
ROSE: Yes.
LORETTA: That was just so... awful!
RONNY: Awful?
LORETTA: Beautiful. Sad. She died!
RONNY: Yeah.
LORETTA: I couldn't believe it! I didn't think she was going to die. I knew she was sick...
