My 24th birthday is in a few weeks. I made the decision this morning to end my life on that day.
EDIT: The responses to this post have surprised me a little. I’ve posted about killing myself before bit I’ve never received an overwhelming amount of feedback like I have here.

I regret posting this but not because of the feedback I got but because it was kind of impulsive, though I do feel authentically suicidal frequently. I feel substantially less suicidal as of right now. I’m not going to therapy yet, still not sold on that. But, for now, you’ve talked me away from following through on committing to my bday plans. 

Thank you all very much. I did not deserve your warmth or kindness. Thanks.
