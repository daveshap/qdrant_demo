LONGFELLOW: Couldn't sleep. Kinda wanted to talk to you. Do you mind?
BABE: No - not at all. I couldn't sleep either.
LONGFELLOW: I wanted to thank you again for going out with me. Huh? Well, I don't know what I'd do without you. You've made up for all the fakes that I've met.
BABE: Well, that's very nice. Thank you.
LONGFELLOW: You know what I've been doing since I got home? Been working on a poem. It's about you. Sometimes it's kinda hard for me to say things - so I write 'em.
BABE: I'd like to read it some time.
