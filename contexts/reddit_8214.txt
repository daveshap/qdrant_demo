What are the implications of repealing the johnson amendment.
President trump suggested he would do away with the Johnson Amendment. http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-destroy-johnson-amendment-religious-freedom-separation-church-state-a7559421.html

I am wondering two things:  
What are examples of things that a church- such as "first baptist church of santaville alabama" can already do legally today as it relates to politics and AFTER the repeal, what are some things that they could do?  (Before and after)

To date, Ive heard countless sermons on the evils of abortion (political policy implications) gambling, alcohol, gay marriage, etc.  All things which depending on a persons religious view are all consistent with religion, etc. and also have direct policy implications.

I would appreciate a few clear, relateable examples before and after. 

Would this be an example of what happens if it is repealed? "pastor joe can now say "vote for Bush" and can write a check from "first baptist church" to "George Bush Campaign fund"?

 Where as before the repeal of the amendment joe could only say "God hates abortion, gay marriage, and we need people in office who agree"?
