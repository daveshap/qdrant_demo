me and my boyfriend went too far yesterday
so yesterday me (15f) and by boyfriend (15m) met up at his. we chatted for a bit, had lunch, talked about videogames and whatnot. he went in for a hug and i was happy to hug back, weve hugged before. we ended up kissing, cuddling, making out and talking about the future for a bit. he asked me if i could take off my shirt, i wasnt sure if he was serious but he said he was. i need to say here that i was NOT pressured into this, i felt comfortable and safe around him and he didnt act like i had to. we ended up making out more as he touched my breasts (with my consent). i ended up taking off my bra and it felt really good at the time, he said i was beautiful and he loved me. after a few more minutes, he suddenly pulled back and got awkward. he seemed to kind of snap out of it, and he said that if we kept going, he was afraid we would end up having sex and neither of us are ready for that. i left a few minutes after. it took a while for everything to settle in, i was kind of in a weird dazed bliss this morning from how much he had complimented me and kissed me but a few hours ago it fully settled in, and now i feel embarrassed and dirty. i cant really talk to him about it today, because its late and ik he needs a break after being with people, but im starting to feel like shit about the whole thing.
