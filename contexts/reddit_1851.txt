I can't believe it's actually 2019
Holy shit man. When they gave me my first school email in elementary school and it used my graduation year in it, I was like "2019? No way. That's so far off, it'll never happen." My kiddy brain could not comprehend that someday it would be 2019 and I'd be a senior. Now it's actually here. I'm just kinda stunned.

Time moves too quickly for my dumb ass. Anyway, happy new year A2C!!!
