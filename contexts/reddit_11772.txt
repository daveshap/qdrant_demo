My cat isn’t adjusting to our new home
I recently moved to a new house and my 15 yr old cat is having a hard time adjusting. She mostly stays in my bedroom. One of the things she’s having the biggest problem with, I think, is the floors. Her whole life I’ve lived in homes with carpet, but now I have hardwood floors. On the rare occasions she comes out, I can tell she wants to play, but she can’t seem to get the hang of running on hardwood floors, so she gets spooked easily and then just hides. Over time she’s lost interest, or started to fear, all of her old toys. She’s always been skittish, but now I don’t seem to even have ways to reward her occasional bravery, aside from treats. Thing is, I can tell when she gets wound up and wants to run around, but she just can’t do it. It was a really good and necessary move for me, but I feel really bad that she’s not coping well.
