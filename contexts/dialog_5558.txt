FERGUS: You're something else, Dil, you know that?
DIL: Never said a truer word.
DIL: See, I was always best looking after someone. Must be something in the genes.
FERGUS: Must be.
DIL: And the fact that you didn't know is basically the fault of yours truly. And even when you were throwing up, I could tell you cared.
FERGUS: You could?
DIL: Do you care, Jimmy?
FERGUS: Sure I do.
DIL: You mean that?
FERGUS: Yeah. I care, Dil.
