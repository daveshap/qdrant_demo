Breaking someone’s heart sucks.
Ugh.  Dated a guy for three weeks. On paper he is perfect.  Everything I hoped for.   We have fun together, he makes me feel special, desirable and loved.  The problem? I am not attracted to him physically.  I had to end it tonight.   While it would have been easy to drag it out and have someone, it wasn’t fair to him.  

 It was awful.   Dating sucks.
