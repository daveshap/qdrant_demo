BUD: What did you do to your hair?
FRAN: It was making me nervous, so I chopped it off. Big mistake, huh?
BUD: I sort of like it.
FRAN: Say, you got a lulu.
BUD: Yeah. I better not get too close.
FRAN: Oh, I never catch colds.
BUD: Really? I was looking at some figures from the Sickness and Accident Claims Division -- do you know that the average New Yorker between the ages of twenty and fifty has two and a half colds a year?
FRAN: That makes me feel just terrible.
BUD: Why?
FRAN: Well, to make the figures come out even -- since I have no colds a year -- some poor slob must have five colds a year.
BUD: That's me.
FRAN: You should have stayed in bed this morning.
BUD: I should have stayed in bed last night.
