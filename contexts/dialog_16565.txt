CHANG: Oh, yes. There is a tribe of porters some five hundred miles from here. That is our only contact with the outside world. Every now and again, depending upon favorable weather of course, they make the journey.
GEORGE: How can we get in touch with them?
CHANG: In that respect, you are exceedingly fortunate. We are expecting a shipment from them almost any time nowâ€”
LOVETT: What exactly do you mean by almost any time now"?"
CHANG: Well, we've been expecting this particular shipment for the past two years.
BARNARD: Two years!?
CHANG: Yes.
