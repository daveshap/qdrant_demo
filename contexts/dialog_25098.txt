STOSH: But it's not just those legs. It's that nose of yours I'm crazy about. That cute little button of a nose!
HARRY: Hey, Animal! Animal!
STOSH: I've been crazy about you for years. I've seen every picture you've ever made six times. I'd just sit there and never even open that popcorn bag.
HARRY: Animal! Animal! Wake up!
STOSH: Betty! Betty!
HARRY: This is me, Animal! It's Harry Shapiro!
