When Does HR Send Rejection Letters?
I know that not all jobs are legally required to send rejection letters and they certainly don’t send rejections to all 100+ applicants that they get for each job. But what about those that they have interviewed 3+ times? The ones that have been interviewing for quite some time? Does HR generally send them rejection letters? 

I was told last Thursday that I would hear back from a job I spent hours interviewing with in person - still nothing from them and today is technically the last day of “early week”. I thought I had a really great shot at getting the job with how well I was connected with people there, but seems they might not agree with me. Just wondering if I may get a rejection letter for some closure at the very least.
