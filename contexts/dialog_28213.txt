MAN: Why were you yelling like that?!
JEANNE: What are you doing here? Please... leave... you can't stay here...
MAN: Why? Are you waiting for someone else?
JEANNE: Yes!
MAN: Who?
JEANNE: My... visions...
MAN: They're going to come and visit you in here?
JEANNE: Yes... that's what I pray for...!
MAN: I want to see that. Do you mind if I stay... on the side? I won't bother you.
JEANNE: No, no -- you can't stay or they won't come!
MAN: Why not?
JEANNE: Because... I have to be alone!
MAN: They won't come anyway.
JEANNE: What do you mean, they won't come?
MAN: Why would they?
JEANNE: Because! Because I've always been faithful to God, and I've followed everything he said... and I've done everything he asked me...
MAN: God asked you to do something?
JEANNE: Yes... lots of things!
MAN: You mean God said, I need you
JEANNE: No, but... he sent me so many signs!
MAN: What signs?
JEANNE: Like... like the wind... and the clouds... and... the bells... and what about that sword lying in the field... that was a sign...!
MAN: No. That was a sword in a field.
JEANNE: But... it didn't just get there by itself.
MAN: True -- every event has an infinite number of causes -- but why pick one rather than another? There are many ways a sword might find itself in a field...
