CHARLIE: Quit. He's too good.
EDDIE: Charlie, I'm gonna take him.
FATS: Your shot.
EDDIE: You miss? Well, you don't leave much when you miss, do you, fat man?
FATS: That's what the game's all about.
EDDIE: Mm hm... Two ball, side pocket.
FATS: Very good shot.
EDDIE: You know I gotta hunch, fat man. I gotta hunch it's me from here on in... One ball, corner pocket. I mean, that ever happen to you? When all of a sudden you feel like you can't miss? I dreamed about this game, fat man. I dreamed about this game every night on the road... five ball... You know, this is my table, man. I own it.
