SUBMITTED NASPA APP
It’s been 5 months in the making on top of school and work, I finally submitted my application for the grad summer intern with NASPA. 

I took the deepest sigh of relief after clicking submit. Now, finals. 

(Didn’t have anywhere else to post and our field is too misunderstood to post in general communities of celebration)
