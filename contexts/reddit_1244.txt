Worst time for an anxiety attack
Got pulled over today. I've been pulled over a few times before nothing scary. Today was different though. After the officer walked up to my car I started having a horrible anxiety attack. The officer noticed me shaking and started to press for why I was so nervous. He went back to his car to run my information and a second squad car pulled up. They both walked up and told me I needed to get out because something wasn't right with me and they needed to investigate. As soon as I explained the anxiety and depression I've been battling and showed them my new medication that I recently started. As soon as they saw that they completely shifted and asked if I needed any resources for them and were wanting to get an emergency crisis officer out there to talk with me and get me help. I've already have been getting help, but for some reason it was meaningful how much they wanted to make sure I wasn't going to do anything to myself.
