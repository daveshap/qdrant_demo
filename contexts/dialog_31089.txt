SAILOR: Anything I can do for you?
LULA: No, I don't think so, Sail. I just need to lie down.
LULA: Sailor? You know what?
SAILOR: I know you ain't particularly pleased bein' here.
LULA: Not that. Look at what I wrote down cause I can't say it.
SAILOR: It's okay by me, peanut.
LULA: Well, nothin' personal, but I ain't sure it's okay by me.
LULA: Really, Sailor, it ain't nothin' against you. I love you.
SAILOR: Love you, too.
LULA: I know. Just I'm sorta uncomfortable about the way some things is goin', and this don't help soothe me.
SAILOR: I know this ain't easy, Lula, but I ain't gonna let things get no worse, I promise.
BOBBY: Hey, pretty woman... Sailor here?
LULA: No, he's out changin' the oil in the car.
BOBBY: Man, I gotta take a piss bad... Can I use your head there?
LULA: Well... Yeah - okay.
BOBBY: I don't mean your head head - I'm not gonna piss on your head - your hair an' all... Just piss in the toilet. Y'all take a listen - here a deep sound comin' down from Bobby Peru.
PERDITA: Oh... Look at this... What do you want, snakeskin?
SAILOR: Just passin' through on my way to who knows where...
PERDITA: Sure... I figured I'd see you sometime...
SAILOR: Hopin' you could tell me if there's a contract out on me. I really need to know.
PERDITA: By who?
SAILOR: I think Santos or Marietta Fortune.
PERDITA: Heard you was goin' out with that bitch's daughter.
SAILOR: You heard right.
PERDITA: You really are one dumb asshole.
SAILOR: Life is unpredictable.
PERDITA: Does that girlfriend of yours know that her mama and Santos killed her daddy? Does she know her own daddy was one of the biggest drug dealers around - till he started snortin' the shit himself?... Does she know you was around that night her daddy was set fire to?
SAILOR: I didn't see nothin'...
PERDITA: Yeah... But I did... And I told you all about it...
SAILOR: Is there a contract?... We made a deal once that we'd tip each other off if we ever heard.
PERDITA: I know... I remember.
SAILOR: Well?...
PERDITA: I ain't heard of nothin'.
SAILOR: Thanks...
BOBBY: Hey... You gotta smell in this room of puke... You been pukin' in here, little girl? Huh?... You sick?... Pregnant?
LULA: You used the toilet, now you can go - what I do around here ain't any of your business, that's for sure.
BOBBY: You know, I really do like a woman with tits like yours that talks tough and acts like she can fuck like a bunny... Can you fuck like that?... You like it like a bunny?... Huh?... Cause baby, I'll fuck you like a real good like a big ol' jack-rabbit bunny... Jump all around in that hole... Bobby Peru doesn't come up for air.
LULA: Get out.
BOBBY: Am I scarin' ya?... Your pussy wet?... Come on... is it?... Hey, don't jump back so slow... I thought you was a bunny... Bunny jump fast - you jump back slow... Mean somethin', don't it?... Means somethin' to me... Means you want Bobby Peru... You want Bobby Peru to fuck you hard baby - open you up like a Christmas present.
