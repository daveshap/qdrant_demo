I recently got a Warehouse/Shopper job at Amazon, what can I expect to do and how can I prepare for it? What does the average day look like for those who worked this job before?
I just put in for a job at amazon (40 hours a week, 4 days a week.) what can I except my job to look like, and whatâ€™re some tips anyone may have for someone starting up?
