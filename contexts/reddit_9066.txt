Texafornia dreaming: These two states represent very different approaches for helping the homeless, which approach works the best and why?
>Texas and California are the biggest, brashest, most important states in the union, each equally convinced that it is the future...  For the past few decades they have been heading in opposite directions, creating an experiment that reveals whether America works better as a low-tax, low-regulation place in which government makes little provision for its citizens (Texas), or as a high-tax, highly regulated one in which it is the government’s role to tackle problems, such as climate change, that might ordinarily be considered the job of the federal government (California).

California has committed to [spending many billions](http://www.ebudget.ca.gov/2018-19/pdf/BudgetSummary/ClimateChange.pdf) on climate change. Is there any evidence that this spending has - or has not affected the homeless?

>Each state has different laws and other conditions which influence the number of homeless persons and what services are available to their homeless people. 

* Here are the statistics. [LINK](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2019/06/20/texafornia-dreaming)

>"California in 2017 had an oversized share of the nation's homeless: 22%, for a state whose residents only make up 12% of the country's total population...  In 2017, homeless persons in California numbered 135,000 (a 15% increase from 2015)." [LINK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness_in_the_United_States_by_state)

The homeless issue has now become a serious [public health issue](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chuckdevore/2019/06/04/typhoid-fever-typhus-tuberculosis-are-l-a-s-medieval-diseases-coming-to-your-city/) for California.

>Half of the homeless population of the U.S. reside in one of five states, with Texas having the fourth largest population... According to the U.S. United States Department of Housing and Urban Development,,, Texas has seen a decrease of 2.4% in total homelessness since 2015.

* California has a [new business tax](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chuckdevore/2018/11/07/homeless-in-san-francisco-taxed-to-texas/) to fund homeless programs.
* The NY Times says why the problem is getting worse in California [here](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/05/us/los-angeles-homeless-population.html).
* California's governor believes that Texas is making the homeless problem worse for California. What is the evidence that his claim is or is not correct? [LINK](https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-gavin-newsom-texas-homelessness-crisis-republicans-essential-politics-20190624-story.html)

>[According](https://files.hudexchange.info/resources/documents/2018-AHAR-Part-1.pdf) to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), “California accounted for 30% of all people experiencing homelessness as individuals in the United States and 49% of all unsheltered individuals” with a homeless rate of about 2.5 times the national rate. California accounts for 12% of the nation’s population.

* Here is the plan for Texas. [LINK](https://www.tdhca.state.tx.us/tich/pathways-home.htm) Texas seems to put more of the effort at the local level.

In addition to the state plans some cities are acting to reduce homelessness

* San Francisco has a plan that has yet to accomplish its goals. [LINK](https://www.sfchronicle.com/politics/article/SF-s-budget-to-soar-by-10-percent-to-12-3-13911737.php) The rate is up dramatically, [up 17% last year](https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/Santa-Clara-Co-Homeless-Population-Increased-2019-Census-510028921.html).

>The number of people living on the streets in Los Angeles and San Diego, two epicenters of the crisis, fell this year, suggesting those cities’ efforts to combat the problem could be starting to pay off. [LINK](https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-homeless-count-20181218-story.html)

* The City of Amarillo has an interesting small initiative. [LINK](https://www.texasobserver.org/instead-of-fighting-tent-city-amarillo-decides-to-house-its-homeless/) This may be an example of a community really making a difference.
* The city of Houston also has had success. In 2017 the homeless rate dropped by 17% and since 2011 the rate is down by 75%. [LINK](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/homeless/houstons-solution-to-the-homeless-crisis-housing-and-lots-of-it/)
