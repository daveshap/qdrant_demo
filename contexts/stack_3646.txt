How can CSRF POST happen? I realise this is a newbie question but when it comes to this im clearly that.On a browser, assuming one received a cookie from site A. Then a different  site B makes a call to site A through it's javascript (lets leave redirects/clicks aside for now).Does that call also carry the cookies stored in the browser for site A or is it that cookies are only sent through the appropriate domain context?Im trying to better understand CSRF and evaluate if what im describing is a real scenario. For redirects such as facebook.com/DELETE_EVERYTHING where GET requests aren't idempotent I understand not much can be done. But I'm trying to see what other cases CSRF covers and how a POST can happen through CSRF.If what I'm describing is valid then I understand how a CSRF token might help but in that case, why is this allowed in the first place?If not, how can a CSRF POST happen?
