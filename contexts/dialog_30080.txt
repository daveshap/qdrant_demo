MUNNY: I ain't like that no more, Kid. Whiskey done it as much as anythin' I guess. I ain't touched a drop in ten years. My wife, she cured me of it... cured me of drink an' wickedness.
THE KID: Well... you don't look so prosperous. Hell, you could buy her a new dress out of your half. We could kill them two an' you could buy your wife one of them fancy...
MUNNY: She's passed on, Kid.
THE KID: Huh?
MUNNY: Been gone near three years now.
THE KID: Oh.
THE KID: Don't tell nobody about the reward an' all. Don't need no other gunmen tryin' to collect.
MUNNY: I don't never see nobody anyhow.
THE KID: If you was to change your mind, might be you could catch me... due West to the Western Trail an' North to Ogallala.
WILL: Who's he?
MUNNY: Best we move that pig.
