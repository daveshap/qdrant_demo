DAE get nervous to return to work or school after you've been away for a little while?
For me, it doesn't seem to matter how comfortable I am somewhere (though it is worse at newer/less familiar places), but if I get sick or something and skip a few days of class or work, I get really anxious to go back. Particularly when I've been sick because I'm afraid I won't be totally better and I'll have to come home or it'll cause a lot of problems. Right now, I'm returning to work after leaving sick last week and I'm really anxious about it.
