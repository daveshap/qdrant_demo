DRM using embedded private key I've started learning about cryptography used for DRM solutions, and curious to know if this is a valid solution for a custom embedded system running purchased software assets.ECDSA public / private key is generated before device manufacture.Private key is embedded in device, and public key is registered on company server against device's serial number.When software is purchased, the hardware's serial number is sent to server as part of the transaction.Before being made available to download by purchaser, the software is encrypted using the hardware's public key, associating the software with that particular hardware.Once stored on the hardware, the software is decrypted Just In Time for execution using the embedded private key.
