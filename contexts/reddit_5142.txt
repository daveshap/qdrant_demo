Why is it everyone is so much more qualified than me?
First: A disclaimer. I have Aspergers so I am not human, and that has caused me a lot of trouble in the job search.

Main post: Why is everyone so qualified? I see postings for Environmental Scientist and similar jobs that are entry-level and require 3-5 years of experience. How did you humans become so qualified? I'm aware that almost everyone applying to these jobs has that experience by graduation from college. How? How did you do it? I'm disgusted that I don't have the qualifications you humans have but I want to learn how to act like one of you so I have a small chance of getting a job. For reference, 85% of my type of vermin are unemployed, so it's clearly our fault. I just want to know how you do it. How do you humans become so qualified so quickly? How do almost all of you humans have jobs? Why can't I be like you?
