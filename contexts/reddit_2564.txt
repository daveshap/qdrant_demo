Job that I was a runner-up for 8 months ago and was told "we would be interested in talking again in 6 months" has advertised a new job that's an even better fit to my skill set. How should I go about this?
I want to ring up the key contact person and highlight my previous positive feedback, is that a good idea? Or is there better options?

What other ways could I jump on this opportunity?
