PASSED MY DRIVING TEST AFTER 7 YEARS
I am 23 years old, meaning that I have been putting off getting my drivers license for 7 years (since I was 16 obviously). Because I’ve had horrible anxiety with everything in my life, and driving/performing in front of others being at the very top of my fears, I went and took my on the road test today and PASSED. I didn’t have to use any medication or deep breathing, I just knew how amazing it would feel once it was over. I’ve gotten my permit 3 times in the past but let them expire because of my fear of the actual driving test. TRUST ME. If I can do it, you can do it
