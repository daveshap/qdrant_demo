Why does everyone want my snap?!
I swear it’s so annoying, I’ll get like two messages then “add me on snap”. Like for one I’d like to get to know you more before adding you on snap. But also I don’t see why it has to be snap? I understand the idea of wanting to move out of tinder, but why can’t we just message somewhere else? I hate Snapchat, and people never have conversations on there anyway. God it’s so frustrating to get “hey” “how are you?” I’ll reply then “that’s cool add me on snap” one guy got mad that I didn’t want to add him!
