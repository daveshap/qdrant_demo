SUSAN: I don't believe this is happening...
NEBBLEMAN: Susan, Dr. Argon is giving you an opportunity here.
SUSAN: Opportunity?
SUSAN: There's a guard outside my door! I'm a prisoner, Nigel! Do you understand that?
NEBBLEMAN: Dr. Argon would say we are all prisoners.
SUSAN: Argon is a lunatic! I can't believe I was stupid enough to believe I could control him. You heard what he said, Nigel. He doesn't care if all of Calumet City is turned to Jell-O. How can that not affect you?
NEBBLEMAN: Because I am a new man, Susan. I am a man of vision. Your problem, Susan, is that you're always looking down. If you'd just look up you'd see the big picture and in the big picture men of vision do not dwell on what might be lost. They focus on what can be gained.
SUSAN: Is that what Argon told you?
NEBBLEMAN: No! Well, not those exact words.
SUSAN: Nigel, can't you see he's using you?
NEBBLEMAN: Of course he is, but at least there isn't a security guard outside my door.
SUSAN: You're afraid of him.
NEBBLEMAN: Who isn't?
