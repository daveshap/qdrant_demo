Is it possible to get a good job with a DUI?
I was pulled over for a DUI almost a year ago. It wasnt intentional, I woke up from sleeping and drove, since then I decided to quit drinking.  I'm wanting to join an apprentice as an electrician, plumber, or HVAC tech, I  have a small side business as a handyman now. My question is, is it even worth considering because no one will hire someone with a DUI in that industry, or should I go fulltime as a handyman when I move down south and work for myself. I'm 29 and looking for a new career path. Thanks!
