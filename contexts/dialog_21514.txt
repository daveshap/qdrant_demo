BLOOM: Uh ... uh ... ooooooops?
BIALYSTOCK: Who are you? What do you want? Why are you loitering in my hallway? Speak, dummy, speak! Why don't you speak?
BLOOM: Scared. Can't talk.
BIALYSTOCK: All right. Get a hold of yourself. Take a deep breath, let it out slowly and tell me who you are.
BLOOM: I'm Leo Bloom, I'm an accountant, I'm from Whitehall and Marks, I was sent here to do your books and I'm terribly sorry I caught you with the old lady.
