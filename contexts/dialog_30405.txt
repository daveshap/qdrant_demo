FISHER: He's cracked up.
BOYD: He is not cracking up.
FISHER: Boyd...What have we done?
BOYD: What did you ask me?
FISHER: What?
BOYD: What is the question you asked me?
FISHER: I said, what have we done?
BOYD: Yes, you did. Now that is the question! That is exactly the question we should be asking ourselves. You tell me Fisher. What have we done?
FISHER: I don't know! I just want to get married.
BOYD: Say it again.
FISHER: What?
BOYD: What you just said. Say it again.
FISHER: I just want to get married.
BOYD: Exactly! Exactly my point.
MOORE: What's your fucking point?
BOYD: I'm not talking to you?
FISHER: What's your point?
BOYD: You want to know what you are doing here?! You are love pumping. You are protecting all that is sacred and beautiful and in sync with poetry and sunsets and little newborn babies. You are walking the walk. This is it Fisher, the real stuff. You love this woman. Love is second to nothing. I love you. I love Moore. I love Micheal. This car is full of love, and nothing - absolutely nothing - supersedes love, man. Nothing. We will do what it takes. Whatever it takes.
