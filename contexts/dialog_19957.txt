ELLEN: Piss off, Merle. So how you gonna find him, Betty?
BETTY: I'll go to the Hospital.
ELLEN: What if you can't find him? What if you get out there, and nothing's the way you thought it was gonna be?
BETTY: Like Rome?
ELLEN: Worse.
BETTY: You made out alright.
ELLEN: Yeah, but at least I knew Rome was gonna be there when I arrived...
BETTY: Ellen, this is the biggest thing I've ever done, but I've gotta do it.
ELLEN: You take care of yourself then, Betty, and don't let anybody stop you...
BETTY: To tell you the truth, I can't believe I've made it this far. It may not be Europe, but I just know there's something special out there for me...
