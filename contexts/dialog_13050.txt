MARY: What the hell are you laughing about?
BABY: I just pictured the tire sitting in a chair watching TV.
MARY: Oh, wonderful. Fucking psycho.
BILL: I guess I'll try to back it out on the rim... at least to the main road.
BABY: If you keep going straight you can get back on the interstate... it's easier.
MARY: Just back up.
JERRY: I think we should go straight. I mean we know for a fact there ain't nothing back that way, right?
