Former Direct report promoted over me-How to stay until I am vested in my pension?
I work for a local government as a Manager in Finance for the past four years, CPA, MBA.   My boss never really liked me and will be retiring in a few months.  I just found out that one of my former direct reports will be assigned a deputy director position in my department.  I wont be directly reporting to her but she will be now above me.    My boss hasn't told me yet, but I am concerned over how to handle it.  I am 55 and the person promoted over me is 32.  I have a year and a half to go before I get vested in the pension plan.  I am pretty popular with my staff but the fact that management has not told me is concerning.  My staff is beginning to find out, this is the second time I have been passed over, and last time I think my employees (Civil servants) complained to management, which also can cause me problems.    I am  an at will employee, so I cant 100% be assured that my job is safe.  I am so scared to discuss with my boss for advice.  Can probably go to another manager for advice, but it will all go back to my boss or people above her. What should I do?  I also requested and received a 5% performance increase last year along with a cola of 2%, which is a lot for the local government.  I think there is some support for me above my current retiring boss.  Help me!!! I don;t want people to feel uncomfortable around me and would like to stay to get vested at least, if not longer.
