Finding Entry-level science work
Hi there, I have recently graduated college with a BA in what is basically communications. However, once I was too far in I had a change of heart with way degree. I minored in environmental science and took extra classes, but I feel like a fish out of water. I have been browsing through jobs trying to find entry-level work or internships in anything. I plan to go to grad school- the reason for this post is that I am trying to boost my application to give myself an edge with that. Anyways does anyone have ideas of job types that I can apply for, or maybe volunteer work that would help with my grad school application.... Thanks
