Does anyone have any recommendation when a coworker you trained becomes your manager?
I have been working at my current company for almost two years. 8 months ago we hired a new person in my position who i trained on the nature of the job, and also on some of the law. This person has become my manager now even though she struggles with some of the cases, in the sense that she cant' play the devil's advocate or fully understand some of our policies. Regardless of this, she is a yes-man person so she become my manager. 

I am upset and sad about this and while i would quit in a heartbeat, i want to spend one more year in this job for my retirement to vest, and develop professionally. I think the quality of work has also slipped a bit since then, but i will own it. 

Have you been in a situation like this before? what advice to you have?
