Boot Camp keeps booting to Ubuntu instead of Windows I have a macos and Windows 10 already installed.  I went ahead and installed ubuntu via EFI, and I think I really messed something up.Every time I boot and select Windows it goes to the purple Ubuntu boot manager. I really need access to Windows, as it has my work files on there.  Is there a way I can go back to having boot camp launch windows instead of Ubuntu?I can access Ubuntu, however.
