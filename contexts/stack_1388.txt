why does a potencial coil in wattmetter influences the pointer rotation can somebody tell me,why does a potential coil in wattmetter influences the pointer rotation.if the ideal potential coil doesn't have current, it would not generate a magnetic field and it would not exerced ana kind of force.But for the wattmeter to work, the force experienced by the pointer as to be proportional to the current passing the current coil and the voltage across the potential coil.Can you try to explain me this, (interaction between voltage coli and current coil).thanks
