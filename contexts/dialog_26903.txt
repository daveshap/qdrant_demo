SARAH: ...look, Lieutenant...uh, Vukovich, don't put me on hold and don't transfer me to another department...
VUKOVICH: I won't. Now just relax. Where are you? Yeah, I know it...on Pico. Are you alright?
SARAH: Yes, but I don't want to leave. I think this guy's following me.
VUKOVICH: Alright, Ms. Connor. Listen carefully. You're in a public place, you'll be safe 'til we get there. Stay visible. Don't go outside or in the restroom. I'll be there in a few minutes.
