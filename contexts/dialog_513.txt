CLAUDIA: As far as I'm concerned, I think she's alive... Why, even this morning... that business about the shark... it wasn't at all true.
SANDRO: And why do you tell us this only now?
CLAUDIA: I... I don't know... I didn't think it was worthwhile... She was laughing over it...
CORRADO: Really! Still, it remains to be seen why she invented a shark. What was her purpose in that?
CLAUDIA: Maybe you'd better ask him.
CORRADO: What were you and Anna arguing about?... Excuse me for being so indiscreet, but this is serious...
SANDRO: Nothing but the usual argument... The only thing was -- if I remember correctly -- that she said she had a need to be alone.
CLAUDIA: And how do you explain that?
SANDRO: Are you the owner of this place?
OLD MAN: No. The owners are in Australia.
SANDRO: But where did you come from?
OLD MAN: From Panarea. Why?
