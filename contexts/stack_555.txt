Create wifi network in Ubuntu 17.10 How do I create a new wifi network in Ubuntu 17.10? In older versions there is an Edit connections option in the menu bar where you can create a new wifi network. But in Ubuntu 17.10 I didn't find this option.Without this create new wifi option I don't know how to share my internet using a wireless hotspot.The important thing is I am trying to share a wired connection via hotspot, not a wireless connection from hotspot.
