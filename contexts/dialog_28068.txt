EDGAR: We've been aware of some very serious vampire activity in this town for a long time.
ALAN: Santa Carla has become a haven for the undead.
EDGAR: As a matter of fact, we're almost certain that ghouls and werewolves occupy high positions at City Hall.
SAM: I have something to tell you guys. Not only is my own brother showing systems of being a vampire... but now I'm convinced my mother's <u>dating</u> one!
EDGAR: That is very probable. What's your reasoning?
SAM: Well... he only shows up at the store after dark. And today, his dog attacked my mom. Listen to this. From <u>Vampires</u> <u>Everywhere</u>... 'Vampires require a daytime protector -- a <u>Guardian</u> -- to watch over them as they sleep. For it is during the day that the vampire is most vulnerable. Since they hold sway over animals, <u>fierce dogs -- the hounds of Hell</u> <u>-- are often employed for this</u> <u>purpose</u>.'
