Medical & mental health academic accommodations in grad school
What experiences have people had with requesting academic accommodation due to chronic medical and/or mental health issues, and what advice do you have to offer for someone attempting this for the first time? While I understand that the process will necessarily differ by institution, it would be enormously helpful to hear about other people's experiences dealing with the process, and what kind of accommodations were offered/agreed upon. 

For context, I have been struggling with anxiety, panic attacks, and very severe seasonal allergies -- all documented, though I am not actively seeing a mental health professional at the moment. After I had a meltdown earlier this semester when I had to go off my allergy medications for a week, my program director encouraged me to reach out to academic accessibility office. This is more urgent to me now, since I have relocated for virtual classes to my hometown, where there is a lot more pollen than on campus (warmer suburb vs. cooler city) and my mom won't. close. the. damn. windows.

At the moment, I'm planning to just request extended time for exams, which is an area where I feel is extremely impacted due to impaired ability to focus, and only do so via my allergist. (I am leery of how the university may handle any mental health diagnoses.) Is this a good idea? Should I ask for more?
