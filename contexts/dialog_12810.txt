HILDY: I'm coming! Keep dead quiet. Don't even breathe.
MOLLIE: I'll be right here. I won't leave you.
ENDICOTT: Hey!
HILDY: Mollie, drop down here! You've fainted!
MOLLIE: What's the idea?
HILDY: Never mind! Just play dead.
MOLLIE: Hey --
HILDY: Shut up, you!
ENDICOTT: Kind of exclusive, ain't you? We got calls to make, you know.
HILDY: Run down and get some smelling salts, will you?
