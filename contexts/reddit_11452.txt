Husband is finally doing what makes him happy and I'm just lonely
My husband is finally doing things that he's really enjoying. He's got a nice job and is going back to school for what he's always wanted to do. And I'm so happy for him.

But I'm spending a lot of time by myself these days because those things take up a lot of time. Large chunks of my day are just me. I'm working through quite a bit of anxiety and depression (my husband knows about it and I am seeing a therapist for it) and I really could use someone around more often. I guess you could say that I have a lot of separation anxiety lately.

I love him to death and definitely don't want this to come between us. But every time I bring up my loneliness, I feel like I'm trying to take away from what's making him happy. Which I really don't want to do since he's come a long way in his own depression. 

I need a new solution other than just clinging to the times he is around. Does anyone have any suggestions? Aside from the "just make friends" stuff because I am working on that too. It's just tough when everyone has other classes or work schedules. Everything is just really tough. My husband and I have planned to do what we can to match our next semester classes as much as possible to get more together time, but I need a solution to last until then.

I also have other anxieties since I'm having trouble landing a job with my odd schedule. Money is a little tight but manageable. (Another job would push us out of the worry zone.) Which I think adds to the tense atmosphere. If I could just land a stupid job, I would have so much damn alone time.
