Should I be worried for my job?
I work in a retail pet store and saw on my company's website that they are hiring for my position at my store, however as a department manager there is only one person in that role. My numbers are good and I have never been reprimanded or anything. The only problems I can think of are that I have never been allowed to complete management training because my store manager wants us on the floor at all times, and that I am never allowed to take time to assign other employees to clean the quarantine room or do it myself for the same reason, so its always a little disorganized back there.
