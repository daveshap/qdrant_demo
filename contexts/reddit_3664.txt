Does anyone else find dating draining? (23F)
I find dating so draining, emotionally, physically, and mentally. Maybe I doing something wrong but I so tried of putting effort for no return.  Like everyone else I want the "happy ending" but I am tired of putting in the work for shitty people and just to have it fade into nothing.

I will say that I am serial online dater. I get dating apps chat with people, meet people, things seem great, but they just never work out. So I delete the app and go I am a strong independent women binge. Work on self and enjoy the single for a while it is great. But after a while it gets boring so I join the apps again. Only to remember how much I hate them. I am just tired of the dating game, I don't find it fun. All I want to do is skip to the end were I meet someone and don't have to date anymore.
