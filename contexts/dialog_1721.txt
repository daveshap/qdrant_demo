TEDDY: But these, like, White Supremacists trashed my office, last week.
MILO: What?!
TEDDY: They're in the neighborhood. They usually hassle Vietnamese grocers.
MILO: Jesus, Teddy.
TEDDY: I'm cool. They didn't touch the machine. Or my disks. Probably didn't know what they were. So, you a Moonie yet? Milo?
MILO: I met this girl.
TEDDY: What? Come on. Is it serious?
MILO: I don't know.
TEDDY: Did you tell Alice?
MILO: No! I keep thinking it'll go away. But there's this -- connection. She's been hacking since she was little, she had to move around a lot. Plus I see her every day, we're working on the same program. She's -- beautiful.
TEDDY: A beautiful geek? I don't wanna sound paranoid, or like a pig, but what're the chances?
MILO: What d'you mean?
TEDDY: I dunno. I guess Larry's got me totally suspicious of that place.
MILO: What does that mean?
TEDDY: Milo, geeks don't have two girlfriends. Most don't have one.
MILO: I didn't plan this.
GARY: What'd the girl say?
PHIL: There may be a little less trust after your outburst.
PHIL: Hasn't affected his work, though.
GARY: Nothing does. Still. I want him to like me.
