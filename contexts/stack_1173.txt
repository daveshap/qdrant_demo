User Quota Default Oracle I am sure I should either know this or have been able to determine this, but I am investigating an issue with user allocated space quotas and am wondering how to determine the default (if there is one).  Our users are running into a problem with a database set up by another individual and apparently none of them were set up with specific quotas.  Is there some default quota that users are set to and if so, how can I determine what that is or change it.  At this point, I am setting them individually, but was not sure why they were never established originally.
