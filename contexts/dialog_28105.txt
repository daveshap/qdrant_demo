LOMBARD: Moreau? C’est moi. Alors...
MOREAU: Salut, Laurent. Ouais. It wasn’t easy but I got what you wanted through Interpol. Say, what’s your business with these Spitzes?
LOMBARD: They lost their son. Why?
MOREAU: It appears that in their younger days they were actively involved with a shady German group of Nazi hunters known as “Never Forget”. Over the years we’re talking about a dozen or so execution-type killings.
LOMBARD: Are they still operative?
MOREAU: Their last suspected kill occurred two years back, though your Spitzes now probably do no more than bankroll the group. Still, I’d watch my step. These people are well-connected, Laurent; former Israeli prime minister, etc. The lady’s also president of an international Zionist organisation... Anyway, you get the picture.
LOMBARD: Mossad?
MOREAU: It’s a good guess...
