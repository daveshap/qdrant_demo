What should I say about me being laid off?
So I was laid off from a job a month ago. I was there for about a year. It wasn’t the right fit so I was somewhat relieved. I’m feeling self-conscious about potentially having to explain that I was the only one that was laid off in a small team. We didn’t part on bad terms but I’m not 100% my direct manager will sing me praises either. 

I had sent out some resumes prior to being laid off and now just starting to get callbacks for interviews. 

Wanted to ask what I should disclose? I’m sure I will get asked “why are you looking for a job?” Should I disclose that I was laid off (technically was still employed when I sent out the resume) or spin it so that it focuses on why the potential new job is the better fit? Technically they are not asking if I’m still employed. I don’t want to lie but I also want to be mindful about what I am obligated to disclose at this stage of the recruiting process. 

I asked my previous employer (a big corporation) about what they will disclose to my future employer in terms of reason for me no longer employed, they said they can only confirm employment dates and salary. Actually there is a toll free number that they provide to do that. 

Thoughts?
