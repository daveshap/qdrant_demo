EDWARD: What, a father's not allowed to talk about his son?
WILL: I am a footnote in that story. I am the context for your great adventure. Which never happened! Incidentally! You were selling novelty products in Wichita the day I was born.
EDWARD: Jesus Christ.
WILL: Friend of yours? Did you help him out of a bind?
EDWARD: Come on, Will. Everyone likes that story.
WILL: No Dad, they don't. I do not like the story. Not anymore, not after a thousand times. I know all the punchlines, Dad. I can tell them as well as you can. For one night, one night in your entire life, the universe does not revolve around Edward Bloom. It revolves around me and my wife. How can you not understand that?
