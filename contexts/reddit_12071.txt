I found out that someone I cared about doesn't like me the same way that I liked him
Some background information on this person: we met in 2009, our 10th grade year. He liked me but I never felt the same way and told him so. We grew close and actually ended up going to the same college (it wasn't planned). Our first year in college he became really assertive which I liked and we started a sexual relationship with one another for the whole school year into the summer.

For our sophomore year, I couldn't live on campus but he did. As soon as he moved on campus, I heard less and leas from him. I thought he was just busy with moving in and whatnot so I didn't think much of it. Throughout that fall semester, he would ask me to drive him to Walmart and I would cause I thought "hey, at least I get to spend a little time with him."

I forgot to mention that for my birthday in September (of my sophomore year), he said that he loved me which further my interest in him thinking that everything was fine between us.

Come this school semester, his birthday was in January and I said I loved him and he said he loved me back. So I'm thinking cool, we still have that bond. 

Today, I send him a text saying that I miss him and he asks where is this coming from and after that I find out that he doesn't feel the same way that I do about him. So now, I feel real shitty and told him that I can't talk to him anymore. 

I don't blame him. I just wish he let me know when he didn't care for me on that level anymore. Mainly, I was too blind to see that the lack of attention was his way of showing me. Still sucks tho.

Tl;Dr - Fell in love with a best friend of 4 years buy just found out that he doesn't feel the same way.
