Would we observe beats if the ratio of the frequencies of two waves is irrational? For Example, Would we observe beats for a 540 Hz sound wave and a 545.879614.....(irrational) wave? Though they lie within 10Hz of each other, their sum would not produce a periodic function so I don't think they will form a beat. If I'm wrong please correct me and provide the beat frequency of these two waves.
