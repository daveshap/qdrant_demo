HENRY: So now my plan was to stay alive long enough to sell off the dope that the cops never found and disappear for a while until I got things straightened out.
HENRY: Where's the stuff?
KAREN: What are you talking about?
HENRY: You know. The stuff I left.
KAREN: I flushed it down the toilet.
HENRY: You what?
KAREN: What did you want me to do with it? They were all over the house.
HENRY: Are you fucking nuts? That was forty, fifty thousand. I need it. I was depending on that money.
KAREN: They had a warrant. They went through everything. They would have found it. I swear.
HENRY: Shit You know they would have never found it. Why did you do it? Why did you do it? My God, why did you have to do it?
KAREN: Oh no! No! Noooo!
