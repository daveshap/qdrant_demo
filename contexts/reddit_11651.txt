i've gained weight
so i've been gaining weight slowly.. it's really starting to depress me. two years ago i used to be a uk size 12, occasionally 14 on top because i have big boobs (size 34H), and i slowly crept up to being a 14 overall.. blamed it on being curvy and just shrugged it off.

as well as the ever creeping weight gain, i broke my ankle so my exercise levels have gone from walking an hour or two a day to nothing, plus all the wonderful snacks people have been bringing me had really started to add up. 

my mother called me fat so i thought i'd measure myself and prove her wrong but it turns out she was right and i've somehow become a size 18!

i just wanted to rant about this, my best friend doesn't think that i've gained any weight even though i feel physically sick when i look at myself and can always "feel" the extra fat whenever i'm just sat around and i feel disgusting. thanks for listening. :<

edit: thank you all for your lovely comments and really helpful advice, i'm getting out of this funk!!
