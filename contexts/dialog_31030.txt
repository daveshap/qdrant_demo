HELEN: Your parents never wanted to interfere with your life, Ted. They knew your Mom and Dad loved you very much. They knew they did the right thing. But that doesn't mean they didn't watch you and miss you, from afar.
TED: You mean they knew who I was?
HELEN: They kept this scrapbook of your life. It meant the world to them.
TED: I wondered about them, for so many years. I wondered if I looked like them, acted like them. I wondered why they gave me up.
HELEN: Giving you up was the most unselfish thing they ever did. When they founded Heaven
TED: My legacy.
HELEN: Your parents would be crushed to think you weren't happy with it.
TED: They're not my parents, Helen. My parents are back in Xenia and I hurt them very much.
HELEN: I understand.
TED: And the girl I love, she hates Heaven." If I keep it
HELEN: But how can you respect yourself if you don't?
TED: Everything I am is because of you. Can you ever forgive me?
MOM: Oh, Teddy. We missed you so much.
