I tried killing myself today.
I wanted to jump off the top of a church tower, about 80m up. The church was supposed to be open, but just when I got there, a man came out from the entrance and ushered me out the gates because the church was closing early today. Somewhat ironically the name of the church is "our Saviour's church".

Talked with a close friend just now and I'm gonna seek professional help tomorrow. This time this shit has gone too far. Had I arrived even half an hour earlier, I wouldn't be here right now. Such a surreal feeling.
