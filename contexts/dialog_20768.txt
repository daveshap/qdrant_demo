ANDREW: The partner who spotted the lesion, Walter Kenton, used to work for Benton, Myers, in D.C. There's a paralegal there, Maria Torres. She's had lesions on and off for three years. She says it was common knowledge around the office that her lesions were caused by AIDS.
JOE: They didn't fire her?
ANDREW: No. They didn't fire her.
JOE: So Kenton connected the... lesion, <u>and</u> whatever suspicions he had about your personal life... to this woman, Maria... and blew the whistle on you. Suddenly you're losing files, and it's time to let you go. But, up to this point, you've been their Golden Boy, their rising star... Their behavior is... inconsistent.
ANDREW: Thank you.
JOE: There is no relevant precedent.
ANDREW: Arline decision. Supreme Court.
JOE: Arline?
