KURTZ: Why did you come to ... my province.
WILLARD: We were attacked -- down river. We need supplies and medical help.
KURTZ: You were not coming here, to see me?
WILLARD: No -- no, sir.
KURTZ: You came up my river -- in that small boat. So simple. I always thought the final justice would come from the sky, like we did. You are the final justice, aren't you?
WILLARD: What do you mean, Colonel?
KURTZ: What other reason could you have come? A Captain. Ranger. Paratrooper. Graduate of the Recondo School. Am I right about these things?
WILLARD: You know you're right.
