asked for status yesterday. got rejection email today. is it bad to respond I'm available for temp r/o
work while they continue search? the job has been posted for weeks and they don't seem to be in a hurry to fill it yet when I spoke with hiring managers they were expressed how desperate they were for help with scheduling/going through emails etc. my guess is that wanted someone more junior than me and more Admin focused.

so should I offer my services as a contractor or would that be pathetic and inappropriate?
