ALFRED: Ta ta, Hudson Hawk.
HAWK: Too-do-loo, babe.
ALEX: Did I miss anything?
HAWK: Oh, not much. Gates just had his tonsils taken out. The hard way.
ALEX: Geez, Gates was killed. Who do we send the thank you note to?
HAWK: The Butler did it. Guy was a cross between Alistair Cook and a Cuisinart. Dude took Mr. Ed and humptied dumptied it over Gates's head. He said it was made by, get this, Leonardo..
ALEX: Ah yes, a rare Renaissance piece. Da Vinci's Sforza
HAWK: Okay, you got me, Mr. PBS.
ALEX: Morning edition. Seems two thieves attempted" to steal it last night
HAWK: Attempted." At-tempt-ted! I'm not happy about having to steal that horse
HAWK: Boing. Uh, this I don t understand...
ALEX: Why try?
HAWK: Because I'm tired of not understanding things. Cops, Mafia, and butlers forcing me to bust my ass to steal something, which it turns out I really didn't steal--it's fucked up.
ALEX: You re not thinking of going to...
HAWK: Alex, my man, it's time to play a little offense. Where's your tux?
