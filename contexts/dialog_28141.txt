LOMBARD: What’s the date?
RHIAN: The nineteenth... How come you didn’t know?
LOMBARD: I’ve been away. Did Leon speak to you about his sister?
RHIAN: Er... Yes...
LOMBARD: Did he ever refer to the hostility between them?
RHIAN: He... Apparently the hostility was all hers. Leon didn’t... It hurt him. They used to be close... Their parents were in their forties when they were born, you see. And mostly away. They grew up in a Scottish mansion with old nannies and servants. He... “Our world was so old and cold, we shone for one another,” Leon used to say. His sister cut him off after she got married. He never understood why but thought it was because she had no children. Was bitter...
LOMBARD: The money Leon left for the boy, was it cash?
RHIAN: Yes. Three thousand pounds. I still...
LOMBARD: Did he mention anything about having an exhibition of his work?
RHIAN: ... No.
LOMBARD: You sure? What about before he turned up with the boy?
RHIAN: ... No. In fact, I’d seen him a couple of months earlier. He was quite depressed. His work wasn’t getting anywhere. He said he was going to try something new, realism, London in the nineties - documentary stuff, you know...
RHIAN: He showed me a book with a picture of a couple caught kissing in a street...
LOMBARD: How’s the boy doing?
RHIAN: Fine...
LOMBARD: Good. You needn’t worry about the Austrian anymore. He’s dead. I’ll be in touch.
