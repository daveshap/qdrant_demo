I’ve accepted that most girls my age (20M, almost 21) have quite a bit of experience with sex and dating
About a week and a half ago I got my first kiss and date EVER and it was great. I had been dying to feel what it was like to makeout with someone and I finally experienced it. 

During the date, she revealed to me that she had had many sexual and romantic partners and even asked me if I was a virgin. I told her the truth and she reacted well, even taught me how to kiss and makeout and it was fantastic. 

At first glance, she doesn’t look like the one night stand type of girl and when she revealed this to me, I was a little bit surprised...but not really. Sometimes I feel kinda alone regarding having little to no experience at this age but I’m starting to care less. After that night, I’ve just accepted that most women have had some experience and hopefully more girls are willing to teach me how to be a better lover.
