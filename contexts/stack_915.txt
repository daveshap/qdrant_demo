Login screen language ubuntu 18.04 I updated Ubuntu 14.04 to 18.04 and now I can't login because I used danish letters (\u00e6\u00f8\u00e5) in my password in 14.04.<br> After the update was finished the language changed to Swedish who don't use the same letters.<br> I tried to change language in the login screen but when i try it disappears right away.I'm so sad now because I had so many things in the hard drive.<br> Hope anyone have a solution because I tried everything possible i could find here and other places.
