HARRY: It's okay.
DOROTHEA: No it isn't. You can't help me.
HARRY: I'm here, aren't I?
HARRY: Nothing's going to happen to you.
DOROTHEA: Nothing?
HARRY: Nothing you don't want.
DOROTHEA: I was so afraid.
HARRY: Don't be. Nix can't hurt you now.
DOROTHEA: Are you sure?
HARRY: I'm sure. He's dead.
DOROTHEA: I know. I'm the one who shot him.
DOROTHEA: I was twelve. Nix took me hostage, to get Swann to come to him.
HARRY: And they all came...
DOROTHEA: Yes.
HARRY: Quaid and Jennifer--
DOROTHEA: And Pimm and Swann. Only Nix was ready for them.
DOROTHEA: What was that?
HARRY: It's okay.
