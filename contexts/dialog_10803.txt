VIGO: I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia, the sorrow of Moldavia, command you.
JANOSZ: Command me, lord.
VIGO: On a mountain of skulls in a castle of pain, I sat on a throne of blood. What was will be, what is will be no more. Now is the season of evil. Find me a child that I might live again.
VENKMAN: I love this. We're onto something really big. I can smell it, Ray. We're going to make some headlines with this one.
STANTZ: Hey, hey, hey, stresshound! Are you nuts? If anybody found out about this we'd be in serious trouble. The judge couldn't have been clearer - no ghostbusting.
VENKMAN: Relax. We're going to keep this whole thing nice and quiet, low key, no profile.
