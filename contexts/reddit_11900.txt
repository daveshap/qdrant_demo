I can't fully trust my girlfriend
I'm dating a girl for almost three years. It's been a long time, but I still have some difficulties to trust her. She is my first girlfriend and I never did much success with girls, so from time to time feel afraid of not have her with me anymore.

I began to suspect her after seeing a message from her ex-boyfriend, he asked her to send voice messages because he was missing her voice and she sent. I was upset and asked her not to do it anymore, and she accepted. A while later I found out they were texting again. I talked again and then she told me she did not know that this made ​​me so bad.

After these episodes, I feel I can not trust her. I see some other guys texting her, but I do not read, I do not think that's really nice. I've talked about this with her, indirectly. I feel it is wrong to prohibit her to talk to other people, it would be unhealthy. But I feel bad, I'm afraid of being betrayed.

I am a very sincere person and always expect it from others. But do not feel that she is sincere as well.

My english is not perfect yet, sorry if I wrote something wrong.
