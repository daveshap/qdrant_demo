INTERVIEWER: Welcome.
CHRISTOF: Thank you.
INTERVIEWER: The catalyst for the recent dramatic events was of course Truman's father, Kirk, and his infiltration onto the show. Before we discuss that, it's worth reminding viewers that this isn't the first time someone from the outside world has tried to reach Truman.
CHRISTOF: We <i>have</i> had our close calls in the past.
