ERICA: He says we got to be at the radio station at seven a.m. Can you handle that?
PONY: Oh, sure.
ERICA: Great. Hi. I'm Erica.
PONY: Oh, Erica, this is my friend Jeff.
ERICA: Hi, Jeff. Nice to meet you.
PONY: Jeff, Erica. God, it's so amazing to be back home.
ERICA: Oh, wow.
PONY: I mean, we've been playing big places everywhere, but when we did that sound check at The Orpheum, it suddenly hit me. I'm playing The Orpheum, you know? I mean, the last time I played here was, uh, the prom.
JEFF: The prom. That's funny.
PONY: Hey, I though you guys were coming to the show, man?
JEFF: Oh, uh, yeah, we were, but, uh, Sooze, screwed up the tickets.
PONY: Oh, man, we were pretty on tonight.
ERICA: Oh, you were excellent tonight, Pony.
PONY: We were?
ERICA: Oh, yeah, it was a great show. You guys missed it.
JEFF: Sorry.
PONY: So how's college?
JEFF: I dropped out. I mean, uh, you know, this semester I'm taking a, a class, you know, three nights a week. But I'm just try-trying to think and work on stuff., you know? I've been doing some writing, though. Short pieces, you know.
ERICA: I love writing. A-Anne Rice? I love Anne Rice.
PONY: Short pieces, huh? You should try to write songs.
JEFF: You know, I've thought about that, actually.
PONY: No, man, I mean it. You're a good writer. I remember those things you'd write during honors English. Funny shit.
ERICA: Mm.
PONY: He wrote this thing about his dick once and he read it in front of the whole class.
ERICA: I'd love to read that.
PONY: Funny shit, man.
JEFF: So you think I should?
PONY: What?
JEFF: Write. 'Cause I, I have written some things.
PONY: Like songs?
JEFF: Yeah, they could be songs.
PONY: Yeah. You should show 'em to me.
JEFF: Really?
PONY: Yeah, really.
JEFF: Now?
PONY: Yeah.
JEFF: Great.
PONY: Yeah, maybe later. Hey! Hey!
SOOZE: Pony, oh my god!
PONY: Hey!
SOOZE: You showed up. Oh, my god! Holy shit! Look at this car, man!
PONY: Oh, it's stupid, isn't it.
SOOZE: Is that your driver?
PONY: It's stupid.
SOOZE: No, no, it isn't. It's cool.
PONY: Look at you!
SOOZE: Oh!
PONY: Wow. Hey, you look good. Like you, you know, head's in a good place, you know? You, are still doing your painting?
SOOZE: Sometimes, yeah. You know, I started to do performances.
PONY: Oh, yeah?
SOOZE: So? What's L.A. like?
PONY: It's pretty exciting.
SOOZE: Yeah?
PONY: Yeah.
SOOZE: Like?
PONY: Oh, uh... uh, the other night our manager Danny took us to this restaurant and there was Sandra Bernhard.
SOOZE: No, she was just sitting there?!
PONY: Oh, yeah, just sitting there eatin' a salad, you know. That kind of thing happens all the time in L.A. It's, you know... I met Johnny Depp.
SOOZE: You did? I love him. Yeah, you know, I'm thinking of moving to New York.
PONY: New York, huh?
SOOZE: Yeah. To go to school and, you know, paint, performances, paint.
PONY: You have to go. You always did such, uh, you know, great work. I still have some of those drawings that you'd do in study hall.
SOOZE: You do not!
PONY: I do. Jeff, don't you think Sooze should go to New York and, uh, you know.
JEFF: Yeah, uh, that would depend, but yeah. She should.
SOOZE: Mm.
