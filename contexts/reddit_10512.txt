The first day after is really weird [TW: Suicide Attempt]
So last night I tried to kill myself. I had every intention on doing so. I was sitting in my car with my gun to my chin and I pulled the trigger but nothing happened. I usually keep a round in the chamber when I carry, so didn't think to rack the slide, instead I just cocked the hammer back. For whatever reason, maybe it was because I wasn't thinking straight, I never racked it after loading the magazine. So when I pulled the trigger, no bullet came out, and it was the loudest click I have ever heard in my life. O drove home and gave my roommate (who is also my best friend) my gun and I told him what happened. I cried, he cried, and he asked me to sleep in his bed with him so he would know I was there. I don't know how but I managed to sleep. But now, everything just feels off. I can't look people in the face, it's hard to concentrate at work, I don't know what to say to anyone. I wasn't supposed to be here today. People are telling me go to a doctor, but I don't want to, I've been through that before and it doesn't help. If you're reading this, thank you. I just needed a place where I could say what happened and not be judged or baker-acted or something.
