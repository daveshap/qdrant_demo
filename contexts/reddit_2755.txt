How do I [22F] bounce back from my terrible job history where I’ve badly messed up every single job I’ve ever had and will I be stuck to low-income jobs for a while?
I have no idea how to navigate this. I’m terrified because I really want to apply to a much, MUCH higher salary job than I’m used to, because I’m very money motivated. I am saving to get out of a mentally abusive family situation and I feel like my little $12.30 jobs have made me feel even more stuck in my situation and hopeless. I’m starting to really grow confidence as far as negotiating goes, however, I just don’t know how I’ll navigate this part. I also don’t drive which I know is asked about a lot so I’m terrified of being seen as worth way less than the job and salary I’m asking for because of it.
