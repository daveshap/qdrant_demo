What’s a good career quiz that can help discover what strong skill sets one may have and also help discover fields of interest?
I am looking to make a career change and can really use some inspiration while gaining insight on what skills I’ve honed over the first half of my career. I would also like to find something that may be a new interest or passion. Any help in finding a reliable source appreciated.
