ICHABOD: The Lenape Indian had much to tell once I opened his mouth.
YOUNG MASBATH: How could he?
ICHABOD: His teeth. Someone had cut them and chipped off rotten pieces far back in his mouth. The Lenape could not have done that for himself. Someone out there cared for him.
YOUNG MASBATH: Where are we going?
ICHABOD: Up.
ICHABOD: What is it?
YOUNG MASBATH: It's payment day. Loan monies are given to Baltus the last day each month. Almost everyone borrows... for tools or to hire workers.
ICHABOD: Out there. What do you see?
YOUNG MASBATH: The Western Woods.
ICHABOD: Look again.
