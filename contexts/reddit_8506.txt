In 2000, Donald Trump ran for President with a plan for universal healthcare. What are the pros and cons of his plan if adopted today?
[From On the Issues:](http://www.ontheissues.org/Archive/America_We_Deserve_Health_Care.htm)

"Iâ€™m a conservative on most issues but a liberal on health. It is an unacceptable but accurate fact that the number of uninsured Americans has risen to 42 million. Working out detailed plans will take time. But the goal should be clear: Our people are our greatest asset. We must take care of our own. We must have universal healthcare.

Our objective [should be] to make reforms for the moment and, longer term, to find an equivalent of the single-payer plan that is affordable, well-administered, and provides freedom of choice. Possible? The good news is, yes. There is already a system in place - the [*Federal Employees Health Benefits Program*](http://mhbp.com/learning-center/fehb-101/index.htm) - that can act as a guide for all healthcare reform. It operates through a centralized agency that offers considerable range of choice. While this is a government program, it is also very much market-based. It allows 620 private insurance companies to compete for this market. Once a year participants can choose from plans which vary in benefits and costs."
