JESSICA: Do you want an aisle or a window seat?
JONAH: Window.
JESSICA: Do you want a fruit plate?
JONAH: I don't know. Do I?
JESSICA: I'd rather die than eat on an airplane. I'm telling them you're twelve so you can fly unaccompanied and they won't make you be carried around by a stewardess and everything.
