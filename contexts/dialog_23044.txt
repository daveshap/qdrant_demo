MR. PRESCOTT: Are you okay?
SIDNEY: Can you knock?
MR. PRESCOTT: I heard screaming.
SIDNEY: No you didn't.
MR. PRESCOTT: No? Oh, well... I'm hitting the sack. My flight leaves first thing in the morning. Now the expo runs all weekend so I won't be back til Sunday. There's cash on the table and I'll be staying at the Raleigh Hilton...
SIDNEY: ...out at the airport...
MR. PRESCOTT: ...so call if you need me.
SIDNEY: Got it.
