Unpopular opinion: Admissions officers can't tell shit about applicants from reading their essays.
A guy at my school who spends his time rating girls, spreading inappropriate pictures, and belittling other people got into Columbia.

A girl who lied about being low income (This girl goes to NYC every month and carries Gucci to school. I also know her family quite well.) just so she could do QuestBridge got into Brown.

A girl who acts like everyone else is stupid and below her (she has called my friend stupid to her face--and not in a joking way) got into MIT.

None of these people were children of donors or were recruited athletes. It makes me angry that shitty people like these get in over people who deserve it. 

Just goes to show how screwed this process is. No, I don't believe admissions officers can truly know an applicant's "story" or "personality" or "fit"--and if they claim they can, I call bullshit.
