SAM: Yes.
NICOLE: How about Sunday night? That's always the best time.
SAM: Okay.
NICOLE: What's going to happen to Dolores?
SAM: I don't know.
NICOLE: Will the police do anything to her?
SAM: It's too late for that. She can't drive the bus anymore. The school board saw to that right off.
NICOLE: She'll move away.
SAM: There's talk of that.
NICOLE: Someplace where no one knows her. Someplace strange and new.
