NICK: What about this Nunheim?
GUILD: Oh, he's all right. We know all about him. He does a little stooling for us every once in a while.
NICK: Did you know he was hanging around Julia?
GUILD: No.
NICK: He's holding out on you.
GUILD: Let's go and see. Taxi!
NICK: This may be a little rough - you'd better let us go alone.
NORA: Catch me letting you go alone!
