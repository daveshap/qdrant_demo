GRAHAM: He may have a history of biting -- barroom fights or child abuse.
SPRINGFIELD: He only bit women so far, right?
GRAHAM: That's all we know about. Most of the time in sex assaults the bite mark has a livid spot in the center. A suck mark. These don't. So, for him, biting may be a fighting pattern as much as sexual behavior. You could try emergency room personnel, treatment for bite wounds. I know that's pretty thin... He bites a lot.
SPRINGFIELD: What's average?
GRAHAM: Sex murder: three. He likes to bite. Six bad ones in Mrs. Leeds. Eight in Mrs. Jacobi... ...that's all I have.
