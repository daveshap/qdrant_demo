COMP2 to trigger One-Pulse mode on STM32L1 I am trying to use the output of COMP2 to trigger the One-Pulse mode of a timer (in my example TIM4, but it's quite flexible if it needs to change to another timer) on the STM32L1 series.In the reference manual, the explanation for the One-Pulse mode uses TI2FP2 as the timer trigger, which is linked to the Input Capture on channel 2 of the timer, however the output of the comparator can only be redirected to Input Capture on channel 4 (except for TIM10 but it doesn't have a second channel to output the PWM on...), or to OCREF Clear.I have tried redirecting the COMP2 output to:\u201cOCxREF Clear\u201d of TIM4,the Input Capture 4 of TIM4,the Input Capture 4 of TIM3 and using ITR2 as the TIM4 trigger (ITR2 is TIM3 when used on TIM4)but none of those options worked.Should any of these configurations have worked and I just didn\u2019t set them up properly? Am I supposed to do it differently? Is there no way to connect the two directly and I should for example start the One-Pulse mode from the COMP2 interrupt?
