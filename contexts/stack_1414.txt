ROV tether: will DC power supply interfere with the control signal? I'm designing a tethered underwater drone. I think I will use RS-485 for control. I can either place batteries in the ROV itself or supply it with electricity via tether. In the latter case, will DC supply line create noise in the control wires? The ROV impedance is going to vary, as far as I understand this is going to cause short voltage drops in the supply line even if it's connected to a battery, isn't it?
