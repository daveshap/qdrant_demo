I utterly hate it when someone tells me that I am wrong. Not because I want to be right but because it makes me feel that I am an idiot or inadequate
I assume that everyone else wants to be right about something and I assume that everyone feels sad when they find out that they are wrong and my judgement tells me that the average person manages to accept it and get it over.

But good Lord, when I come to the realisation that I was wrong about something, whether it was a random thought or something that was carefully thought, I feel a deep anxiety and deep insecurity and eventually, I start to panic and cannot think at all, almost like I suddenly became an idiot or my IQ score dropped my 30 points. 

I am not sure why this happens to me and why I feel like I am personally attacked or feel like I am punched in the stomach when I find out that I was wrong about something 

*(my judgement tells me that either it is because I was raised in a semi-strict background with pushy parents where if you are not on the right, then you are definitely on the wrong; or because I am someone who always took school seriously and when school events are involved like exams or even a classroom interaction, if you posted the wrong answer or the wrong statement, then that means that you are definitely wrong and you get a lower score and in turn, that score affects your self-worth and self-confidence in your ability on whether you are able to think critically)*

But holy fucking God, the fucking of insecurity and despair and the ultimate feeling of self-betrayal and shame just feels like I am somehow struck by lightning and I feel like I am shocked from the inside and cannot move or think or feel. As if my own brain is hijacked
