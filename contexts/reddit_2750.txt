Offered a job while at new job for a month. What to do?
I was laid off and out  of work for six months. A job came up that was basically a lateral move and I took it because I needed to be employed. It's not the move I was hoping to make, but had to make.

I've been at this new job a month when I was contacted for an interview at a different company for a position that will put me on a new career path. It's what I've been looking for.  The interview went great and they're sending me an offer. 

Once I accept, what's the best way to tell my employer of one month that I'm quitting? I, of course, feel horrible about the timing and leaving a job so quickly.
