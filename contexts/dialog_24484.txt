ISHMAEL: That's when he fell.
NELS: Fell.
ISHMAEL: Miyamoto gave him the battery, and left. Carl's boat was running, he goes back to fishing. But at some point, he thinks of the lantern...
NELS: Still lashed to the mast.
ISHMAEL: He figures a perfectly good lantern could get banged around up there. So he climbs up. To cut it down.
NELS: Just as the freighter comes through? Isn't that quite a coincidence?
ISHMAEL: Coincidences happen. You run a yellow light <u>just</u> as a car comes out of nowhere. Split-second tragedy happens every day. Or maybe...
NELS: Maybe...?
ISHMAEL: Maybe Carl picks up something about the freighter on his radio, which is now working. Same report Milholland heard. And <u>that</u> makes him get the lantern fast. Before the freighter's wake can bang it around.
NELS: But you <u>could</u> be wrong. He <u>could</u> have climbed up earlier.
ISHMAEL: Then where's the lantern? And where's the knife?
NELS: The knife. What knife?
