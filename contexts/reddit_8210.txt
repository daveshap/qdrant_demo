How widespread is the fake news phenomenon, actually? Is it partisan in any way? Is it true that Russia is a major player behind it?
The Washington Post printed an [article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/russian-propaganda-effort-helped-spread-fake-news-during-election-experts-say/2016/11/24/793903b6-8a40-4ca9-b712-716af66098fe_story.html?utm_term=.bd8a86ac45b8) on the power of fake news and cited an organization called [PropOrNot](http://www.propornot.com/p/home.html) that claims that Russia is trying to manipulate US opinion through the news media. 

ProporNot wrote a [report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Byj_1ybuSGp_NmYtRF95VTJTeUk/view) mapping the network of Russian propaganda and provides a methodology for how it identifies propaganda promoters. 

Similarly, Rand has put out a [report](http://www.rand.org/pubs/perspectives/PE198.html) about the evolution of a new Russian propaganda model that refers to mainstream Russian news organizations as "a blend of infotainment and disinformation than fact-checked journalism, though their formats intentionally take the appearance of proper news programs."

Pizzagate, a purportedly false attack on members of the Democratic party, has led to [death threats and a gunman](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/06/pizzagate-businesses-washington-threats) for the restaurant in question. Some [reports](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2016/11/25/1603978/-Fake-news-network-tried-to-write-fake-news-for-liberals-but-they-just-never-take-the-bait) have come out that liberals are less susceptible to fake news than conservatives. One [fake news](http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2016/11/23/503146770/npr-finds-the-head-of-a-covert-fake-news-operation-in-the-suburbs) writer claims to have tried to create fake news targeted at liberals, but they didn't bite.

Is the hype about fake news itself fake news? Or overblown news? And how much of it is partisan and pushed by a foreign government?
