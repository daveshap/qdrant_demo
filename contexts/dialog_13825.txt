ERIC KLUSTER: There has been so much soul searching about this Wigand, I've decided we should cut an alternate version of the show without his interview.
LOWELL: So, what happened to Ms. Caperelli's checking with outside counsel first, all that crap?
ERIC KLUSTER: That's happening. And, hopefully we won't have to use the alternate, but we should have it in the can.
LOWELL: I'm not touching my film...
ERIC KLUSTER: I'm afraid you are.
LOWELL: No, I'm not...
ERIC KLUSTER: We're doing this with or without you, Lowell. If you like, I can assign another producer to edit your show...
LOWELL: Since when has the paragon of investigative journalism allowed lawyers to determine the news content on 60 Minutes"?"
DON HEWITT: It's an alternate version. So what if we have an alternate version? And I don't think her being cautious is so damned unreasonable.
ERIC KLUSTER: So, now, if you'll excuse me, gentlemen, Mr. Rather's been complaining about his chair again. As they start to leave...
LOWELL: Before you go...
LOWELL: I discovered this. SEC filing... For the sale of the CBS Corporation to Westinghouse Corporation.
MIKE WALLACE: What?
DON HEWITT: Yeah, I heard rumors.
LOWELL: It's not a rumor. It's a sale. If Tisch can unload CBS for $81 a share to Westinghouse and then is suddenly threatened with a multibillion-dollar lawsuit from Brown & Williamson, that could screw up the sale, could it not?
ERIC KLUSTER: And what are you implying?
LOWELL: I'm not implying. I'm quoting. More vested interests... Persons Who Will Profit From This Merger... Ms. Helen Caperelli
DON HEWITT: Are you suggesting that she and Eric are influenced by money?
LOWELL: Oh, no, of course they're not influenced by money. They work for free. And you are a Volunteer Executive Producer.
DON HEWITT: CBS does not do that. And, you're questioning our journalistic integrity?!
LOWELL: No, I'm questioning your hearing! You hear reasonable" and "tortious interference." I hear... "Potential Brown & Williamson lawsuit jeopardizing the sale of CBS to Westinghouse." I hear... "Shut the segment down. Cut Wigand loose. Obey orders. And fuck off...!" That's what I hear."
DON HEWITT: You're exaggerating!
LOWELL: I am? You pay me to go get guys like Wigand, to draw him out. To get him to trust us, to get him to go on television. I do. I deliver him. He sits. He talks. He violates his own fucking confidentiality agreement. And he's only the key witness in the biggest public health reform issue, maybe the biggest, most-expensive corporate-malfeasance case in U.S. history. And Jeffrey Wigand, who's out on a limb, does he go on television and tell the truth? Yes. Is it newsworthy? Yes. Are we gonna air it? Of course not. Why? Because he's not telling the truth? No. Because he is telling the truth. That's why we're not going to air it. And the more truth he tells, the worse it gets!
DON HEWITT: You are a fanatic. An anarchist. You know that? If we can't have a whole show, then I want half a show rather than no show. But oh, no, not you. You won't be satisfied unless you're putting the company at risk!
LOWELL: C'mon, what are you? And are you a businessman? Or are you a newsman?! Because that happens to be what Mike and I do for a living...
MIKE WALLACE: Lowell.
LOWELL: Put the corporation at risk"...? Give me a fucking break!"
MIKE WALLACE: Lowell.
LOWELL: These people are putting our whole reason for doing what we do... on the line!
MIKE WALLACE: Lowell!
LOWELL: What?
MIKE WALLACE: I'm with Don on this.
SHARON: What's wrong?
LOWELL: They're killing the Wigand interview...
SHARON: What?!
LOWELL: They're pretending it's process. Bullshit, it's foregone.
SHARON: What are you and Mike going to do?
LOWELL: I'm alone on this...
SHARON: Oh, baby...
SHARON: Jeffrey Wigand...
LOWELL: Jeffrey...
LOWELL'S VOICE: Jeffrey, how are you? How's the family, okay?
WIGAND: There is -- there is no family.
LOWELL'S VOICE: What do you mean there is no family?
WIGAND: Liane has filed for divorce...
WIGAND: And, so, I moved out... I see the girls a couple of days a week...
LOWELL'S VOICE: Where you staying now?
WIGAND: Our favorite hotel, honey... I checked into Room 930. Odd choice? Huh?
LOWELL: I don't know how to say this, Jeff, except to just say it right out, so I'll say it. They do not want to air it.
WIGAND: What?!
LOWELL: B & W may have threatened litigation... CBS is on the block... But you, I mean, I know how...
WIGAND: No.
LOWELL: No? No, what?
WIGAND: I do not think that you know" for me... what it is to walk in my shoes... ...for my kids to have seen it... for them to know why I've put them through what I did... the public airing of that... the testament to why I did what I did... you're telling me is not going to see the light of day."
