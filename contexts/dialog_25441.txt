SCRIMM: Where in the States?
PICARD: Oh... here and there. You know how it is.
SCRIMM: Not really. I was born and raised right here. Never had much use for travel.
SCRIMM: Where are you from most recently?
PICARD: California. San Francisco.
SCRIMM: Beautiful city. Used to be, anyway. I didn't think anyone still lived there.
PICARD: There's a few of us left.
SCRIMM: That was a pretty clever trick you did with the hospital's batteries. How'd you do it?
PICARD: It wasn't a trick. I used to be an electrical engineer.
SCRIMM: Huh.
SCRIMM: And what were you doing out at the missile silo?
PICARD: I'm an old friend of Cochrane's... I wanted to see how he was doing.
SCRIMM: Lucky for him you came by when you did. He might be dead now.
PICARD: Yes.
SCRIMM: Maybe you can tell me what he's been doing in that silo. We heard some explosions out there this morning...
PICARD: I think he was running a test on an old rocket engine... and one of the fuel cells burst.
SCRIMM: You seem to have an answer for everything.
PICARD: Something wrong with that?
SCRIMM: Not yet.
