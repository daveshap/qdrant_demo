MILO: In some fashion -- and I lack the intellect to know precisely how -- we have traveled from Earth's future into Earth's past.
CORNELIUS: But we saw Earth destroyed.
MILO: And Earth will be destroyed -- just as we saw it. Only, since fleeing it, we have passed through a....backward disturbance in time -- did you notice the Date Meter clicking down after the shock wave hit our ship? -- and we have returned to Earth almost two thousand years before its destruction. That is another reason for keeping silence. Our human captors would not be edified to know that, one day, their world will crack like an egg and fry to a cinder, because of an Ape war of aggression.
