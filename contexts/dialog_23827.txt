GARY: How's it hanging, Miles?
MILES: You know me. I love it up here. How about you?
GARY: Busy night for a Tuesday. We had a busload of retired folks in on a wine tour. Usually they're not too rowdy, but tonight there was something going on. Full moon or something. What can I get you?
MILES: Highliner.
GARY: Glass or bottle?
MILES: Bottle.
GARY: You got it.
MILES: Say, is Maya working?
GARY: Maya? Haven't seen her. I think she's off tonight. Say, where's your buddy?
