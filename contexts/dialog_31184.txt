PEMBERTON: I only met him once, but that was enough. For such a little man he had quite an oversized opinion of himself. He offered me the rare and unparalleled opportunity" to develop a new steam engine for him. He claims to have some sort of factory in Texas
JIM: Who was this partner of his?
PEMBERTON: A Southern gentlemen. I don't recall his name. I suppose it's unkind of me to say it, but he had the most disconcerting glass eye.
JIM: A glass eye? That's who it was! One-Eyed Jack Garrison. Otherwise known as General Garrison, Confederate Third Army. I saw him at Dr. Loveless' party, but I couldn't place him. He used to wear an eye-patch.
ARTEMUS: Garrison...? Then the President was right. Except it's not a foreign power, it's a bunch of die- hard Rebels trying to make the South rise again.
JIM: And if they've got Dr. Loveless building weapons like those flying bombs... they just might do it.
