Update to "I have a crush on someone, and I'm sick of it." (Not as long)

I ended up telling her how I felt, and she is actually not interested in a high school relationship, she just needs friends, she told me. I understand what she means, but she actually got really upset. Angry and depressed at the same time. She said that she felt like shit for having to reject me, and that I really was a cool guy.

And I guess it turns out that she hates A, at least, that's what she told me. Since then, she went on a vacation to Orlando for 10 days, and she just came back today, and it really is tough to move on. I guess, I just need advice on how to move on.

Is there anyone who could help with this? I want to be her friend, but I still feel overwhelming feelings towards her.
