Office worker being pushed to work remote. Internet access at home limited to cell phone hotspots. How to engage management for a fair arrangement?
My wife and I both work for the same company, and due to the age/risk level of the relatives that we live with, we hearing that our company is pushing us to work remotely from home. The location of our house does not have access to reasonable internet. It simply isn't available without paying for the service provider to run new lines to our home. We do limited video streaming, etc. from hotspots on our cell phones, but it is not super reliable or consistent.

My question is, if my company is having us work remote, how should I be approaching the internet issue? Working remote was not on the table when we started, and I don't really feel it's fair to be required to use my personal hotspot for business use without some kind of compensation, or to see whether they'd make some other arrangement.

Does anyone have any advice as to how to engage management regarding this? I'm trying to be a team player, but I don't exactly have the means do make it work without accomodations on their part. And I don't know if it's smart to go back to the office without endangering my elderly relatives.

I am 20 hours a week, my wife is 40 hours a week. Our computer usage requires placing and answering customer and internal phone calls, and lots of emailing and accessing company servers. Whether that information pertains to any response, I don't know, but figured I'd throw it in.
