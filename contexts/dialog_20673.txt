ROSALIE: What's up?
PEGGY: I think you should give up diving. It's dangerous.
ROSALIE: Don't be silly, I'm the best in the county.
PEGGY: I know you are, but you have to stop. I couldn't tell you before, I didn't know if I should. But you have to stop before you hurt yourself.
ROSALIE: I spend three hours a day practicing. I have trainers, I know what I'm doing.
PEGGY: But accidents can happen.
ROSALIE: Not to me they don't. I'm going to win the State, then the. Nationals, and then I'm going to the Olympics.
PEGGY: Rosalie, please, listen to me! You have to stop.
ROSALIE: You're sick. You should go to the nurse. I'm going to tell Miss Dennis.
RICHARD: What's the matter?
PEGGY: It's all, gone wrong, nothing's working out.
RICHARD: Not true. I think I'm making real progress on the microchip.
PEGGY: You were meant to. You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to. I have to get out of here.
