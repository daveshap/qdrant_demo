Advice on how to quit a job I just started and that I work remotely?
Because of COVID we're all working remotely.
I'm in my 3rd month at this company and I found that I'm really struggling with their processes and it's not a good fit for me.

I found another job that might be more my speed in terms of their processes.

How do I go about quitting? Do I schedule time with my boss and do it over Zoom? What do I say?
