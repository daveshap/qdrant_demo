JIM: Let me show you his picture.
SHAW: No. I'm sure I've never met anyone of such a bizarre appearance.
JIM: Does the name Clay Bertrand mean anything to you?
SHAW: Clay Bertrand? Clay Bertrand? I believe there was a man with a name similar to that who worked at the Chamber of Commerce. Is that the man you had in mind?
JIM: No, it was not. Do you know an attorney by the name of Dean Andrews?
SHAW: One meets so many attorneys in my business. No, I don't believe I know Dean Andrews.
