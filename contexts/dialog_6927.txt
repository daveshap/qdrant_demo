AMY: I got lots of presents.
MISS CALLAHAN: And you should. Your mommy tells me you've been such a good girl, and your daddy is so pleased with you.
AMY: Mommy, could Edward take me to Mrs. Farren's house to give her her present?
ALICE: Wouldn't it be just the same, darling, if daddy dropped the present at Mrs. Farren's on his way to town tomorrow morning?
AMY: But it won't be Christmas tomorrow.
ALICE: All right, Amy. Go tell Edward to take you.
MISS CALLAHAN: Does she go up to the Farren's often?
ALICE: No. I only let her go with Edward. It's alright.
