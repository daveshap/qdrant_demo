AUSTIN: I've got you, Dr. Evil!
DR. EVIL: Well done, Mr. Powers. We're not so different, you and I. It's true, you're British, and I'm Belgian. You have a full head of hair, mine is slightly receding. You're thin, I'm about forty pounds overweight. OK, we are different, I'm not making a very good point. However, isn't it ironic, Mr. Powers, that the very things you stand for-- swinging, free love, parties, distrust of authority- are all now, in the Nineties, considered to be... evil? Maybe we have more in common than you care to admit.
AUSTIN: No, man, what we swingers were rebelling against were uptight squares like you, whose bag was money and world domination. We were innocent, man. If we'd known the consequences of our sexual liberation, we would have done things differently, but the spirit would have remained the same. It's freedom, man.
DR. EVIL: Your freedom has cause more pain and suffering in the world than any plan I ever dreamed of. Face it, freedom failed.
AUSTIN: That's why right now is a very groovy time, man. We still have freedom, but we also have responsibility.
DR. EVIL: Really, there's nothing more pathetic than an aging hipster.
