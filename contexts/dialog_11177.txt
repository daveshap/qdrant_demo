AUDREY: My life sucks.
LUCY: Oh, please, your life doesn't suck. His life sucks.
ANIMAL: That's cuz I'm married to you.
LUCY: Shut up. How can you eat like that?
ANIMAL: Big bites.
AUDREY: I can't believe he put the moves on me. After everything I've done for him.
LUCY: He's scum! As far as he's concerned you're just a pair of breasts that talk.
ANIMAL: I like that image.
AUDREY: You know how I spent last weekend? Walking his damned dog.
LUCY: I'm telling you he's dirt. He's a douche bag, gutter slime, dog crap, puke chunks...
ANIMAL: Hey, hey! I'm eating here!
LUCY: Audrey, you're too damned nice, that's your problem. Nice gets you nothin' in this town. You gotta be a killer to get ahead, you know what I'm sayin'? I'm sorry, baby, but you just don't got what it takes.
AUDREY: Animal, you don't think that's true, do you?
ANIMAL: Nice guys finish last. First rule of the jungle.
AUDREY: Well, I can be tough if I want.
