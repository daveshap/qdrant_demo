MRS. DICKSON: Doesn't that come next?
CLUETT: Yes, yes, it does. What are you doing tonight, Phyllis?
MRS. DICKSON: See, we're getting along famously!
DICKSON: Most of the creditors I know personally. I've seen them grow up in the community. I knew their fathers and mothers before them.
CLARK: I know, Dickson. That's all very well. But you're taking too many chances. In these times a bank should keep liquid in case of trouble. In case of emergency!
