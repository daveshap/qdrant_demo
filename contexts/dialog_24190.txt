ICHABOD: Do you often make a habit of sitting on strange men's beds?

ICHABOD: Feel free to form your own opinion. Though it appears you already have.
KATRINA: Well, I intended to apologize for the behavior of my friend Brom Van Brunt, but it seems I've made matters worse. I'll leave you to your business.
ICHABOD: Excuse me... I should apologize. I, um... I... have no great love of...

KATRINA: My suitor?

ICHABOD: Extra ordinary, yes. But first, you tell me about the Headless Horseman.
