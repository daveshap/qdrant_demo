Fantastic nervous systems and what powers them Nearly all living creatures on this planet have one form or another of a nervous system that transmits sensory data to the creature's brain.What's really interesting to me is that this data is transmitted with electronic signals. So, my question is if our bodies use electricity to power our nervous systems, then do we naturally generate electricity?It would be fascinating if I could understand how we naturally harness this power. I can only imagine what leaps our species could make with bioelectric power generators and circuitry.
