GOATEE KID: I'll be... somewhere else.
GRADY: Hey, Jeff. If you're really interested in discussing that business with the tango, try the guy at the end of the hall.
GRADY: He cribbed that from Borges.
HANNAH GREEN: It beats 'What's your major?'
GRADY: Right. Anyway, I was wondering if I could borrow your car. Mine's sort of out of commission.
HANNAH GREEN: Sure. The keys are on the dresser next to... to your book.
HANNAH GREEN: I uh, I didn't finish, I... fell asleep.
GRADY: That good, huh?
HANNAH GREEN: No, it's not that, it's...
HANNAH GREEN: It's just that, you know, I was thinking about how, in class, you're always telling us 'that writers make choices -- at least the good ones. And, don't get me wrong. I'm not saying the book isn't really great -- I mean, really great -- but at times it's, well, very detailed, you know, with the genealogies of everyone's horses and all the dental records and so on -- and I don't know, maybe I'm wrong, but it sort of reads, in places, like, well, actually, like... ...you didn't make any choices at all. And I was wondering if it might not be different if, maybe, when you wrote, you weren't always... under the influence.
GRADY: Uh huh. Well, thanks for the thought, but, as shocking as this may sound, I'm not the first writer to sip a little weed. And furthermore, it might interest you to know that one book I wrote, as you say, 'under the influence,' happened to win a little something called the PEN award which, by the way, I accepted 'under the influence.'
CRABTREE: Want some help with that?
GRADY: Don't touch it.
CRABTREE: Let me get this straight. Jerry Nathan owes you money. So, as collateral, he gives you his car.
GRADY: Only now I'm starting to think the car wasn't exactly Jerry's to give.
CRABTREE: So whose car is it?
GRADY: My guess -- Vernon Hardapple.
CRABTREE: The hood jumper?
GRADY: He said a few things that lead me to believe the car's his.
CRABTREE: Such as.
GRADY: 'That's my car, motherfucker.'
CRABTREE: Uh huh. So. We find Vernon, we find the car. We find the car...
GRADY: ...we find the jacket.
CRABTREE: There's only one problem, Tripp. We don't know his real name. We just made it up. In fact, we made the whole guy up.
GRADY: No wonder he screwed us over.
CRABTREE: Christ, Tripp. How did you know?
GRADY: Call it a hunch.
