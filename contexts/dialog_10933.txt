JORDAN: The Navy Cross...
INSTRUCTOR PYRO: I believe he earned it for saving a man's life in Saudi Arabia. He wanted you to have it. He was very clear on that point.
JORDAN: I was looking for him earlier, but...
INSTRUCTOR PYRO: The Chief was granted early retirement as of 17-hundred yesterday. By 18-hundred he was gone. Out of the Navy.
JORDAN: Just a coincidence?
INSTRUCTOR PYRO: Maybe it's not my place to speculate on his private thoughts. But I think the Chief knew that his way -- his world -- had come and gone.
