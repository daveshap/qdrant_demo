HARRY: They're going to want answers and they're going to keep asking until they get them.
BETH: We can refuse to talk.
HARRY: Won't make any difference. The tapes document everything.
NORMAN: There is one possibility.
HARRY: We all kill ourselves? Bad joke. Sorry, Beth.
NORMAN: The power allows us to manifest our fears, right? What if we feared the power to go away?
HARRY: You mean forget?
NORMAN: It would erase all our knowledge of it. All of our power.
BETH: Would it work?
NORMAN: Yes. And I think we already know it will.
BETH: How's that?
NORMAN: Down below, Harry said we would all have to die. Since there was no evidence on that spacecraft that anybody knew time travel through a black hole was possible -- and we all knew -- then we would all have to die before we could tell anyone. Death was the only logical explanation. But sitting here, we still know. So how is that possible? Unless we make ourselves forget.
