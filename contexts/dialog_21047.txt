STEW: That's a good idea - telephone the police. The number is Spring 3100. Get a couple of cops over and we can have a rubber of bridge.
ANNE: You may go, Smythe.
SMYTHE: But I—
STEW: Now the lady said you may go—
ANNE: What do you want?
STEW: Well, I tell you, yesterday when I was here, I had one of your books in my hand, and when I got outside, I realized I still had your book in my hand. So as long as I had your book in my hand, I thought I might as well take it home and read it. This morning, I got up and put your book in my hand, and here's your book in your hand.
ANNE: That's considerate of you.
STEW: Yeah, that was considerate of me. I recommend you read it.
ANNE: I'm not interested in your literary recommendations.
STEW: Well, maybe it's a bit heavy for you. Perhaps if you'd like something lighter - something with a touch of romance—
STEW: Just listen to this— Adorable Babykins— Does her miss her Baby? Him sends his booful li'l sweetums a billion oceans full of kisses. Bobo is so lonely—!
ANNE: Just a moment. I don't see how that trash could possibly concern me.
STEW: Ah! But you don't know who Bobo is. And you don't know who Babykins is.
ANNE: I'm not interested. Smythe will open the door.
