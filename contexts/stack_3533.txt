Good Vulnerable Wordpress VM or Lab? I am looking to dive into learning more about Wordpress vulnerabilities and conducting penetration testing against them. Are there any good \"Vulnerable WP Sites?\" that I can download as a VM to play around in? Sort of in the same vain as DVWA or Hackazon? An inital search didn't come up with much--and what did seemed to be single vulnerability labs. Ideally I would like something that's no more than 2-3 years old. Thanks!
