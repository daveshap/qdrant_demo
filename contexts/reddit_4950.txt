I'm awake for the next two hours and happy to provide some direct support through private messaging if anybody needs a bit of help regarding depression and anything else surrounding it like meds, anxiety, loneliness, relationships, PTSD etc.
Remember to call your local emergency services if you or another person is suffering a crisis or emergency and life may be at risk.

Otherwise I'm here and happy to help for the next two hours (AEST) if anyone needs a bit of friendly depression help and support ðŸ™‚
