BUD: He's lying.
LYNCH: Okay, sir. I'll discuss this with the broker and I'll get back to you. You're welcome.
LYNCH: If I'm closing out this account. If he doesn't pay for it tomorrow, you pay for it.
BUD: Mr. Lynch, I swear to you, he's lying!
LYNCH: Fox, you're making more problems than you are sales.
BUD: I don't think you're being fair, sir. You assigned me this guy, and you know he's got a history...
LYNCH: Somebody has to pay for that error. And it's not me.
MARV: Buddy, buddy, buddy; little trouble, huh, today.
BUD: Howard the Jerk reneged on me. I've got to cover his loss to the tune of about seven grand! I'm tapped out man, American Express got a hit man looking for me.
MARV: Hey, things could be worse. It could've been my money. Let me help you out, rookie.
BUD: Thanks Marv, I'll make it good to you. You know what my dream is? One day to be on the other end of that phone...
MARV: Just put me on the institutional side of the room where the real cheesecake is. You forgetting something?
MARV: Buddy, buddy, when ya gonna realize it's big game hunters that bag the elephants, not retail brokers. I heard this story about Gekko... he was on the phone 30 seconds after the Challenger blew up selling NASA stocks short.
BUD: Hello, Natalie -- guess who? That's right, and you know everyday I say to myself, today could be the day... So what do you say... will you marry me? Then please can you get me through to Mr. Gekko?
MARV: It concerns his future!
BUD: Of course he's busy, and so am I. Five minutes. That's all I'm asking. I know that if he could only hear what I have to say... it would change his life.
