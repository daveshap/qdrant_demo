How much is Trump financially benefiting from this vacations?
After seeing a tweet from [The Daily Edge](https://twitter.com/TheDailyEdge) purporting that President Trump took [111 days of vacation](https://twitter.com/TheDailyEdge/status/945841207527333891) in his first year of office, I did a little digging because of The Daily Edge's strong bias.   [The Hill](http://thehill.com/), (which allsides.com calls center, and mediabiasfactcheck.com calls slightly left leaning.) lists the number as 97 days.

The 4 days difference may be because there are 4 days left in the year and the President is scheduled to be on vacation at Mar-A-Lago, his luxury club in Florida, the Hill may be limiting themselves to vacation days that actually have taken place.

The thing that caught my eye was Mar-A-Lago.

A Trump property... 

I was mentally equating Trump taking vacation at one of his properties with President Bush taking vacation at his own his ranch in Crawford, Texas, but that didn't sit right.

You can't rent out time at the Bush ranch.   It is not a for profit institution.

[Mar-A-Lago](http://www.maralagoclub.com/) is.  And so is [Trump Golf](http://www.maralagoclub.com/Default.aspx?p=dynamicmodule&pageid=100008&ssid=100030&vnf=1).

So two questions come to mind, neither of which I know how to research:

* How much does President Trump personally profit from the taxpayer money spent on his vacation at a Trump owned property?

and the second very similar question, assuming that the President of the United States staying at a given place is a bump to that business going forward because people want to stay someplace the President has stayed:

* Of the Trump properties that the President has stayed at, has there been any pattern of *which* properties and how their business picked up after he stayed?

i.e. has he been intentionally bolstering troubled Trump businesses?
