AARON: You've always said you felt goodness in them - that the witches brought you and Rowan together. Isn't that right...? They're reaching out to you, Rowan!
ROWAN: But it doesn't make sense. They - they used Lasher... they conspired with him.
AARON: Who can say the hope of redemption dies with our last breath...? They must see what the legacy has wrought - Diedre, withered inside herself Carlotta, killing and stunting her own flesh and blood... surely they sense the child you carry - and the life it might lead in Lashers grasp... Maybe, in death, they feel remorse for the evil they embraced in life...?!
