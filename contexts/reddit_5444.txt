Have you started a new job in a language you aren't familiar with?
Hi, I'm applying to a job where I know there is professional growth potential and good salary, I have the skills required and some recommendations. I like taking new risks and I'm not afraid to learn the local language (I am already studying hard to get fluency). The thing is I know I will not be fluent by the time I start to work there. 

I can imagine meetings in the local language (French) and even if they can switch to English from time to time, French is the local language, so for the sake of social integration I must get it :) 

What's your experience on such situation? Do you have any advice to handle it? Thanks!
