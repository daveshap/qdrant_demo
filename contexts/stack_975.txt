Using 2 batteries with a thinkpad t480 How does Ubuntu decide which battery to use? The laptop is designed so that you can swap out the extra battery (If extra means 'removable' in Gnome), so it would make sense to default to drawing power form the removable battery always, and only use the built in one if it needs to. This would maintain the health of the battery I cannot replace as well. Is there a way to get it to default to drawing from the removable battery?
