TUBBS: Yeah.
CASTILLO: What's your twenty?
TUBBS: Quarter mile away. We see the lights...
CASTILLO: Turn around.
TUBBS: We know these people...!
CASTILLO: Grieve elsewhere.
FUJIMA: We're not certain...
CASTILLO: You said Nazi Low-riders...?
FUJIMA: We're not certain!
TUBBS: C'mon, man!
FUJIMA: We think NLR. We don't know! Alonzo only fronted as a broker for our guys to make the meet. He wasn't deep into the crew.
CROCKETT: White gangs...? It doesn't track.
TUBBS: White gangs is tweakers and a crystal meth lab in a trailer park. Bounce around the old lady Saturday night and get your recidivist ass busted back...
FUJIMA: Not anymore. This is a distribution network out of South Florida, moving poly-drug loads, crystal meth through coke, to Nashville, Atlanta, Memphis, Cleveland. And computer fraud, identity theft. It's like that.
CASTILLO: Tell them what you want.
FUJIMA: They knew about Alonzo, <u>before</u> he made a move on them. They had our operation. They've cut into us.
CROCKETT: How?
FUJIMA: We don't know.
TUBBS: Break your encryption? Hack your e- mail? Employee databases? Somebody on the inside?
FUJIMA: We don't know. And that's the point. Maybe there's a mole. Whatever, it's a disaster. And it's a Joint Interagency Task Force. I have DEA, ATF, U.S. Customs components in on it. So the penetration could be from any one agency. What we do know is I have to suspend operations right now from undercover work through interdictions 'cause I have to assume our Operational Security is blown.
TUBBS: As in, your ass is dead in the water.
FUJIMA: But Miami PD wasn't part of the J.I.T. And from what Alonzo said, he didn't give you up.
CROCKETT: So what do you want?
FUJIMA: To recruit you.
CASTILLO: ...I didn't want you around the crime scene because it's crawling with federal law enforcement. We don't know who's straight up, who's not...
CROCKETT: Recruit us to do what?
FUJIMA: Get into business with this crew, identify them. Illuminate their network. If you're lucky, discover their source, how they penetrated us. We'll indict and take it from there...
CROCKETT: How do we do that? Make a buy? That went well...
TUBBS: Reverse undercover? WE supply to them?
FUJIMA: They got a steady stream of supply. So, no...
CROCKETT: From whom...?
FUJIMA: A Colombian producer. Named Archangel de Jesus Montoya-Londono.
CROCKETT: Never heard of him.
FUJIMA: From the North Valle area. New. Low-level, we think.
TUBBS: Aryan brothers are not going to change-up suppliers. So...
CROCKETT: Transpo? How they bringing the loads in...?
