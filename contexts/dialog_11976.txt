DAVID: And it's got a handsome partner sitting right beside it.
HOLLY: Yeah.
DAVID: They fit right in together. And your eye goes along, lulled into complacency, and then...
APRIL: That's just --
DAVID: Look at this.
HOLLY: That's disgusting!
APRIL: ...a monstrosity! Who would do that?
HOLLY: It's really terrible.
DAVID: It's really sad.
HOLLY: And it ruins everything else.
DAVID: It does.
APRIL: Well...we have seen a lot of stuff today, though.
HOLLY: Yeah.
DAVID: Yeah.
APRIL: A lot of works.
HOLLY: Yeah.
DAVID: Maybe we should start thinking about going home, huh?
HOLLY: Fast.
APRIL: Oh, geez, yeah.
HOLLY: Okay.
DAVID: Uh, who gets dropped first?
APRIL: Uh --
HOLLY: Oh, gee, I don't know. Um...
DAVID: Well...
APRIL: Well, I live downtown.
HOLLY: Yeah, I, we both live downtown.
APRIL: Uh...
HOLLY: It depends on what way you want to go.
APRIL: Well, wait. You know what? I know.
HOLLY: Uh...
APRIL: If...well, if we took the, if we took Fifth, then-then-then we'd get to your house first, yeah?
DAVID: We could...we could do that.
HOLLY: Right. Yeah, but Fifth is so jammed, isn't it?
APRIL: Well, sometimes, some, uh...
HOLLY: I mean, it's jammed. If we went... um...
DAVID: Y-you live in Chelsea, don't you?
HOLLY: Yes.
DAVID: Well, I-I guess if you live in Chelsea, that's probably first.
HOLLY: Oh, okay.
APRIL: Yeah.
DAVID: And then, uh, April...huh?
APRIL: Great.
