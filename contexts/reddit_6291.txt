Landed interviews for various jobs, the one I want most has the longest on-boarding timeline...
How you navigate the possible situation where you're interviewing and possibly going to be juggling a few offers because all is going so well.. But your top choice (and best qualified) opportunity is likely going to be the most slow-moving?

Do you accept one job and then quit with as much grace as you can muster if you get your top choice? Do you try to stretch out the other jobs' hiring processes? 

My problem also comes up that some of these companies are looking to hire me as a sub-contractor for a term position when the best choice is a f/t permanent gig...
