THOMAS: Tell me again how it started.
KIMBERLY: Like I said, it was like I was there. I remember everything. The sounds of the crashes, the smells, the look on Shaina's face...
THOMAS: Do you remember what triggered it all?
KIMBERLY: The log truck...and everybody I guess. Everyone was driving like a maniac. And somehow I knew something horrible was going to happen, even before it did.
