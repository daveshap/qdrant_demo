It was my birthday yesterday and I spent most of the day crying and depressed but we can't give up.. or we lose the chance that things can get better..
25 was a hard birthday for me. Reflecting on my life and where I'm at had me feeling really down. It seemed out of no where my mental health started making things that were once easy, very very hard. It's taken a toll on my self esteem. I'm starting over with everything. Myself, my home, my career, my education, my health, my relationships, nothing is the same. I've been battling bipolar depression, panic attacks, schizophrenia episodes, constant suicidal ideation and started 2020 in a mental hospital begging to just die. I've lost my identity in the process of everything. I've never been more scared. I'm trying medication again, I'm back in therapy and am having more good days. I'm working on reaching out more to people.  I'm thankful for those who made my quarantine birthday special. My mom made me a home made birthday cake with all my favorite things, my boyfriend had a paint night with me, my sister ordered me dinner to enjoy at home and the birthday wishes from everyone did not go unnoticed. I'm thankful to still be here, still trying, and still fighting & I'm thankful for those that haven't given up on me when I've given up on myself. Here's to 25 and the rest of my life. 🥳🙏🏻
