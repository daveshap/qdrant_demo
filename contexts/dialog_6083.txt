SUSAN: Charlie! I said, what time is it?
KANE: Half past eleven.
SUSAN: I mean in New York.
KANE: Half past eleven.
SUSAN: At night?
KANE: Yes. The bulldog's just gone to press.
SUSAN: Hurray for the bulldog! Half past eleven! The shows have just let out. People are going to night clubs and restaurants. Of course, we're different. We live in a palace - at the end of the world.
KANE: You always said you wanted to live in a palace.
SUSAN: Can't we go back, Charlie?
