BARNES: Edmunds? Get in here. I want to know exactly how this is being transmitted.
HARRY: She's not gonna know.
BARNES: She wired this system.
HARRY: If the technology of that sphere is advanced enough -- the way it functions is gonna appear to us like magic.
TED: Don't gimme that psychology bullshit, Norman. Psychology isn't a science, it's superstition. It's a bunch of soft, subjective theories without any hard data to back it up. With an intellect like this, emotions don't mean shit.
HARRY: It's like showing Leonardo da Vinci a laptop computer. He'd run screaming witchcraft". And you couldn't explain it to him
BARNES: Edmunds?
TED: Don't make stuff up, these emotional theories, just so you can feel important here.
NORMAN: Frankly, Ted, I'd be much happier if Jerry was just a cold, emotionless intellect.
TED: Why's that?
BARNES: Edmunds?
NORMAN: Because if Jerry is powerful and also emotional...
BARNES: Damn it, Edmunds?
NORMAN: ... it raises a very serious question: <u>What happens if Jerry</u> <u>gets mad</u>?
BARNES: Edmunds? Can you copy?
