MASSERIA: Tommy tells me that Capone's coming in from Chicago.
LUCIANO: He's trying to make it.
MASSERIA: He'll think something's wrong I ain't there.
LUCIANO: He'll know you were smart enough to stay away, Boss.
MASSERIA: What the fuck does that mean?
LUCIANO: You know that if you come, we gotta invite Maranzano.
MASSERIA: So fuck him. I don't care anymore. Let him come.
LUCIANO: So he can talk to all the families behind your back? Maybe have his own meet at 3:00 AM under the goddamn boardwalk? No. You're too smart for a sucker play.
