JOE: You don't want me, Sugar - I'm a liar and a phony - a saxophone player - one of those no-goodnicks you've been running away from -
SUGAR: I know. Every time!
JOE: Do yourself a favor - go back where the millionaires are - the sweet end of the lollipop - not the cole slaw in the face and the old socks and the squeezed-out tube of toothpaste -
SUGAR: That's right - pour it on. Talk me out of it.
OSGOOD: I called Mama - she was so happy she cried - she wants you to have her wedding gown - it's white lace.
JERRY: Osgood - I can't get married in your mother's dress. She and I - we' not built the same way.
OSGOOD: We can have it altered.
JERRY: Oh, no you don't! Look, Osgood - I'm going to level with you. We can't get married at all.
OSGOOD: Why not?
JERRY: Well, to begin with, I'm not a natural blonde.
OSGOOD: It doesn't matter.
JERRY: And I smoke. I smoke all the time.
OSGOOD: I don't care.
JERRY: And I have a terrible past. For three years now, I've been living with a saxophone player.
OSGOOD: I forgive you.
JERRY: And I can never have children.
OSGOOD: We'll adopt some.
JERRY: But you don't understand! I'm a MAN!
OSGOOD: Well - nobody's perfect.
