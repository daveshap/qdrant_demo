What does the latest Politico article on Hillary campaign's fundraising mean?
I'm seeing wildly different stories based on which sub I go to. [This Politico article](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/04/clinton-fundraising-leaves-little-for-state-parties-222670) describes what they found after looking at where the money goes.

On the one hand:

> According to the agreements signed by the participating committees, which were obtained by POLITICO, the money is required to be distributed, at least initially, based on a formula set forth in joint fundraising agreements signed by the participants. The first $2,700 goes to Clinton campaign, the next $33,400 goes to the DNC, and any remaining funds are to be distributed among the state parties.

And then directly the next paragraph:

> But what happens to the cash after that initial distribution is left almost entirely to the discretion of the Clinton campaign. Its chief operating officer Beth Jones is the treasurer of the victory fund. And FEC filings show that within a day of most transfers from the victory fund to the state parties, identical sums were transferred from the state party accounts to the DNC, which Sandersâ€™ supporters have accused of functioning as an adjunct of the Clinton campaign.

So I'm pretty confused. The [Bernie campaign](https://berniesanders.com/press-release/politico-exposes-clinton-campaign-money-laundering-scheme/) and [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/4hifll/politico_exposes_clinton_campaign_money/) is predictably saying that this is evidence for corruption and is illegal. Hillary [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/hillaryclinton/comments/4hikmd/bernie_sanders_official_website_is_now_accusing/) is saying that Bernie has the same arrangement just never donated money to DNC, and that Bernie received money from abroad for the campaign.

So what is going on? How will this effect the campaign?
