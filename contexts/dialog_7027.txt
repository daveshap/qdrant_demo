DOOLITTLE: Oh yeah?
TALBY: Doolittle... I think it's the Phoenix Asteroids!
DOOLITTLE: Phoenix?
TALBY: It is, Doolittle, it's the Phoenix! They glow with all the colors of the rainbow, just like everybody said.
DOOLITTLE: No kidding?
TALBY: I'm going into them, I'm going to hit them. Doolittle...
DOOLITTLE: Yeah?
TALBY: Before we get too far away, and our signals start to fade, I just wanted to tell you... you were my favorite. I really liked you, Doolittle.
DOOLITTLE: I really liked you too, Talby. Hey, some debris from the ship! It's coming right by me.
