You might be the one pushing them away too, even if you are interested
Allow me to explain i’ve found out through therapy that you can push someone away with other kinds of behavior that’s not outright rejecting, ghosting or fading (even if you like them!). What happens is if i’m interested in someone by default i expect them to not like me back and subconsciously i try to push them away, i’ve observed my behavior and this is what i gathered.

-Overtexting and then pulling back in an attempt to seem chill, this just confuses the other person and makes them lose interest (Hot and cold behavior).

-Not being able to manage my body language, mine is very closed off and guarded, this has been very challenging to work on.

-Subconsciously “forgetting” to answer questions or to  engage in a conversation in a personal way that allows the other person to know you better, so i come across again as either not interested or confusing (you can ask a lot of questions, yet not speak about myself and making it seem as if i’m closed off). This could be solved i think, by allowing yourself to let yourself be you, not what you think you should be and if your personalities don’t mesh at least you were honest.

-Subconsciously “forgetting” to be physically receptive to flirting, like expecting them to do so but it reads as not wanting to be touched if that makes sense. It doesn’t necessarily have to do with having sex, but shutting off the sexual part of attraction (personally i don’t have sex unless i’m in a relationship), but what i mean is that i don’t initiate flirting making me seem like i’m not interested in physical touching.

-I never state that i’m interested and look for signs the other person doesn’t find me attractive or interesting, then i start backing off with no explanation, making them back off as well and thus making a cycle.

-I’m afraid that the moment that i start liking them and let my guard down i will hurt them/scare them with my affection, this is a big and tough one for me because i tend to get attached quickly (i hardly find anyone that i really like and tend to feel really strong about them) and i couldn’t advice someone on this because i don’t know exactly the reason behind it.

-Thinking i’m not interesting enough and that i should have a million hobbies to be even considered dateable, so it becomes an obsession with being perfect for the people i like and never let my true personality show.

-Trying to burn them out subconsciously by being clingy, then when they back off i feel really insecure and i don’t reach out to them, thus coming off as selfish or without a backbone.

Essentially i’m emotionally unavailable subconsciously, but it overlaps with my desire to be in a relationship, if you’re like me and feel like people pull away from you, really consider whether you’re pushing them away in ways you don’t know. For me it’s a deeply ingrained self esteem issue.
