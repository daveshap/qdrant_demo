STEED: Ah, Brenda ... Mrs. Peel?
EMMA: You should be dead. How do you feel?
STEED: Strange.
EMMA: You were very lucky. Four shots to the heart. I found you after I slipped away from Sir August. Mother brought you here. Not me you should thank.
STEED: I wasn't about to.
EMMA: I mean your man Trubshaw. Your bullet-proof waistcoat. I thought you were just overdressed.
STEED: I might say the same.
EMMA: Mother and Dr. Darling have me under observation. They think I tried to kill you.
STEED: Why should they think that?
EMMA: You told them. You said I arrived on a camel, shot you four times. Left you for dead.
STEED: Frankly that's how I remember it.
EMMA: But that's absurd. I may not be over-fond of you, Steed, but it's not my style.
STEED: Perhaps your memory plays tricks, Mrs. Peel.
EMMA: That's possible. Sir August was convinced he'd met me before. But I'd never met him. Another odd thing. When it rained, he said it was just as someone had promised.
STEED: Did he say who?
EMMA: No. But he must know. Incidentally, my double left you with this.
STEED: An invitation. To a 'formal picnic'...?
EMMA: Did you say formal? I must dress.
STEED: I must say, you look more your old self --
EMMA: You mean my other self ...
STEED: Either way ... may I ask: why you dress in that fashion?
EMMA: I should have thought that was obvious ... I'm in mourning.
