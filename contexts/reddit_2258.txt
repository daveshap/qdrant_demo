I got off UCLA’s waitlist!!
I am shaking so badly right now, it is hard to believe. I got off the waitlist of the best public university in the nation. I can’t believe it. My family is poor, I’m the first gen to go to college. And I did it.

Edit: You guys are awesome. Thank you so much for the kind words and support!! I’m still in shock!
