Did they know Ash VS Evil Dead was ending when making the final episode? Ash VS Evil Dead ended a few months ago after three seasons. The ending of the show was exciting, and not unreasonable I think. The big thing is that, unlike Seasons 1 and 2, there was no real cliffhanger....ish. The plot lines had been more or less wrapped up is what I am trying to say. That is pretty unusual, with the ending taking the kind of turn that I could not see them having continued for a fourth season picking up from the third. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019d have watched it and loved it, but it was very much a cowboy riding off into the sunset sort of thing. Maybe you want to know later adventures of the cowboy, but the story has ended here. It wasn\u2019t announced that the series was cancelled until after the series was being broadcast. That combined with the ending sounds to me like they knew they were hitting the end and worked to wrap up the story. But when I\u2019ve gone to try to find anything about it, all I see is the announcement of the cancellation, Bruce saying he\u2019s not doing Ash anymore, and announcement of a video game tie-in. Is there any indication in an interview or something in which the creators talk about knowing the series was ending and deliberately writing it to a close?For a little bit of context, I keep thinking about The Tripods series, where they found out halfway through filming the final episode that it would be the final episode. So they very quickly wrote in an ending which would not be a cliffhanger but if by some miracle they got a third season, they could have reasonably picked up from that point.
