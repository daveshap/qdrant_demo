I (15M) am about to report a group of girls who have been assaulting me for the past 2 years.
From September 2017 the group of 'popular girls' from my school took it upon themselves to make my life a living hell. They tried hugging, kissing and groping me pretty much every day no matter how many times I've told them to stop or that I don't appreciate it. I've been firm with them and warned them that I'll report it but they aren't phased. It dropped off after July this year when I lost it with them after a week of getting my ass grabbed at every opportunity and told them to get out of my life forever.
They've recently started again and they're just toying with me like I'm an object to vent their abuse on. I never did anything about it because I thought nobody would take me seriously as I have a lack of evidence due to cameras not being around school.
I break up for half term next Friday and I'm going to hand in a report of all of the incidents that have occurred with them including dates, times and witnesses. They've broken me and I'm not going to let the school sweep this under the rug. If they don't act on it I'm planning on giving the report to every school teacher I have and to the local newspaper, as I'm sure it'll make local news. 

Teenagers of reddit, how do I get the school to take me seriously and do something about this?
