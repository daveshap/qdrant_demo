I have access to 24 months of FREE scholarship! What should I do with it?
Basically I'm a veteran and used my benefits to get an undergraduate degree. Currently working in government for peanuts. And I still have 24 months left under my contract so I've been thinking about going to school as opposed to just throwing it away. 

I've been thinking about law or business school but I know that's just going to lead to failure or unemployment. What are some other degrees or studies or certificates worth pursuing?
