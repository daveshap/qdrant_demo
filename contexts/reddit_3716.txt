First dates feel like job interviews to me now.
I'm a 22 year old male, been on 28 first dates since I started at 18, the most recent was just today. We met for a quick coffee at noon. As soon as I sent the follow up text a few hours later I knew she'd reply with a polite rejection telling me I seemed like a nice guy but not thinking it would work out. And she did.

The thing is, I don't even enjoy first dates, not really. I kind of dissociate when I get there, it feels like a job interview, like I'm not there to enjoy myself or get to know another person, I'm there to get a second date. Then I go on a second date to get the third date, and the third date to whatever--it never goes past the third date.

Dating with the apps feels so artificial. I'm an introvert (surprise, surprise) and it takes time for me to be myself. All my close friends tell me it took a while before they felt that I actually liked them. It's just my nature which flies in the face of how most people expect an insta connection on first dates. Even more so when you're strangers on apps. 

I know I should take a break I have taken many breaks and I always crawl back to the apps, if not for the paucity of available women in my immediate day to day life, then to fight back my fear of dying alone or being a 40 year old virgin that's never been in a relationship. I feel trapped in s cycle of failure and I can't escape. I feel like I'm living my best life beyond dating--my research looks promising (in grad), I have a good position, I have a car, I'm fit, I'm as social as I can be. But I'm alone. And I hate it.
