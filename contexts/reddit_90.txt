What am I supposed to do about my crush?
I'm a girl that's a freshman in high school. I've liked this guy in my class for a few months. However he's very shy/quiet and always hangs out with guys and never with girls, which makes it harder for me to talk to him. I've had conversations with him here and there, and I know that we have some things in common (like the bands we listen to, or this one show we watch). 
I don't know for sure whether he likes me or not, but I do know that he isn't going to make a move even if he likes me. So I've been thinking about telling him how I feel on the last day of school before summer break starts. I am actually not worried about getting rejected, I'm mostly doing this for myself, but what I'm worried about is the possible awkwardness when sophomore year starts.
 So far, everybody has told me that I shouldn't be anxious and just tell him how I feel and maybe he wants to know me better, but I can't decide. Should I tell him? Or should I just drop it since he doesn't seem to be interested in anyone?  Thank you so much for the advice!
