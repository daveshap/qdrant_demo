RAY: Hell of a day for a ballgame, huh, Claude?
CLAUDE: Hell of a day, Ray. Yankees are on fire.
CLAUDE: No, this ain't gonna work either. It's half chocolate, half vanilla.
RAY: So?
CLAUDE: They're touching.
RAY: If you don't eat that ice cream right now, I'm gonna strangle you until you are completely dead.
CLAUDE: Yeah? You and what army?
RAY: Next thing, you're gonna be complaining about the seats.
CLAUDE: Well, if you must know, they could be closer.
RAY: Damn, I shoulda let Spanky Johnson drown you in the river when I had the chance.
CLAUDE: I know you're not talking to me...
RAY: I'm sorry, he's on medication...
