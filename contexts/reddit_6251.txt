Making transitions smoother: how to switch firms?
I'm a lawyer in my late 20s.  I have worked for the same firm since I graduated university - so about 4 years now.  After a good run of interviews,  I was offered a job at a competing firm.  And I start there in early December.

Are there any important things to look out for when joining a new team?  Do's and Dont's?  Anything I can do in the coming month to prepare for the shift?
