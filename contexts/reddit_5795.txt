just got fired, no degree, no idea what to do
I'm a 28f with two kids and a fiance. I just got fired from my serving/bartending job and idk what to do. I've been casually pursuing an associates in chem for years (bc raising a family+work+school+[newly managed] mental health issues is A LOT to handle at once) but I think I'm going to switch to environmental biology bc it's not quite as intense. Regardless, I dont want to be in the service industry anymore. I loved it and I made alright money but it's a dead end and not really fulfilling. I wish I could find a position (like, any position) somewhere more in line with my future career interests but with no degree idk how I could accomplish that. 

I used to have so many goals and career aspirations and it just never happened. My fiance makes a pretty decent salary and I tend to handle the domestic stuff, and it's actually an okay balance for us, but I hate depending on him financially. I feel like a failure. Any advice?
