ELLIE: Hey, we qualify for the Senior Citizens Early-Bird Special... Did you see Tommy today? He misses you...
MIKE: Well. This'll be over soon. Venza's such a nut job, we're bound to pick him up soon.
ELLIE: I'd like you to switch to the day shift, Mike. To be home for dinner. Helen insists that T.J. be home for dinner... That's why he's on the morning shift.
MIKE: Well, T.J.'s... seniority... and all. I'll talk to Garber about it.
ELLIE: I already did. I mean, I talked to his wife, and she talked to him...
MIKE: You talked to his wife?
MIKE: My wife talks to his wife about what shift I'm gonna take?
ELLIE: What's the difference?
