How to stop picking my nails/the skin around them
I've had a bad habit for a few years of picking my cuticles. I usually do it subconsciously when I'm nervous, anxious, or even just bored. It gets so bad to the point where my fingers start bleeding a lot and I always have to ask for band aids from teachers. I've tried cutting my nails really short and it didn't stop me from it. I'm so tired of buying Band-Aids and having messed up bloody cuticles. It looks really bad and it's not a habit I want to continue. 

I'm desperate and any advice would really be helpful and appreciated.
