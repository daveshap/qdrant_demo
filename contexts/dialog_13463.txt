WENDY: Good-night dad.
BEN: Good night kiddo.
ELENA: You're staring at me.

ELENA: I've been thinking, Ben, about Wendy. I was going to ask if she'd come with me sometime to meet Dr. Woolens.
BEN: That shrink -- the one you always wanted me to see? I thought you dropped him.
ELENA: I did, but -- somebody should probably see her, talk to her... You think she's ok?
BEN: Why shouldn't she be?
BEN: Then again, why should she be? I mean with us, with our...
ELENA: So maybe you'll come too?
BEN: Oh not again Elena! If we've got problems, why can't you just come out and talk about them.
ELENA: It's you Ben who needs to talk. I've had my say, and I'm waiting to hear back from you.
BEN: Yeah but Elena, even you don't believe all that I'm OK. You're OK" stuff you keep babbling about -- you say so yourself. I've been all ears for about ten years now on his subject
ELENA: -- And you haven't moved out yet. It's because you're too lazy, Ben. Too scared or lazy to either deal with us or simply make a decision --
BEN: Elena.
