ANYA: Dmitri didn't want the money?
TATIANA: No, he just wanted to know you were happy.
VLADIMIR: Fortunately, I am to be married. With your highness, permission.
ANYA: Vlad, stop acting this way! You're my friend!
VLADIMIR: No. From now on I am your loyal subject ... your highness. By your leave?
ANYA: Why does everyone have to act that way?
TATIANA: You'll have to become used to it, child, if you accept the crown...
ANYA: If" I accept?! Of course I'm going to accept! it's what I always wanted!"
TATIANA: Is it? Is this what you want?
ANYA: I wanted to come home, Grandmama - and I did. I came back to my home with you.
TATIANA: You can't go back to find your home. Your home is in your heart, in the future that you make for yourself.
ANYA: And this is my future. This is who I am!
TATIANA: This is who you were. Exactly who you are is up to you.
ANYA: I don't know who I am! I still don't know!
TATIANA: Yes, you do. You do.
