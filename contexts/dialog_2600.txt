HOLLY: That your spider in there? In that bottle?
CATO: Yeah.
HOLLY: What do you feed him?
CATO: Oh, flies... grasshoppers when I can catch 'em.
HOLLY: Does he bite?
CATO: He never bit me.
BOY: Hi. where's Cato?
KIT: Well, he's gone.
BOY: Gone?... Where?
KIT: He said not to tell.
BOY: Oh yeah?
KIT: Yeah, he said for you to give us a lift into town. You're the ones with the Studebaker, aren't you?
