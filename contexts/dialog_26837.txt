RIPLEY: I wanted to tell you my plan.
DICKIE: So tell me.
RIPLEY: I thought I might come back. In the New Year. Under my own steam.
DICKIE: Really? To Italy?
RIPLEY: Of course. Let's say, for argument's sake, you were here -- perhaps we could split the rent on a house -- I'll get a job -- or, better still, I could get a place in Rome and when we're there we could be there and if we're here we could be here --
DICKIE: Oh God, I don't think so.
RIPLEY: You see, particularly with the Marge problem, you can just blame me.
DICKIE: Marge and I are getting married.
RIPLEY: How?
DICKIE: How?
RIPLEY: Yesterday you're ogling girls on the terrace, today you're getting married. It's absurd.
DICKIE: I love Marge.
RIPLEY: You love me and you're not marrying me.
DICKIE: Tom, I don't love you.
RIPLEY: No, no, it's not a threat, I've explained all of that.
DICKIE: I'm actually a little relieved you're going, to be honest. I think we've seen enough of each other for a while.
RIPLEY: What?
DICKIE: You can be a leech -- you know this -- and it's boring. You can be quite boring.
RIPLEY: The funny thing -- I'm not pretending to be somebody else and you are. I'm absolutely honest with you. I've told you my feelings. But you, first of all I know there's something -- that evening when we played chess, for instance, it was obvious --
DICKIE: What evening?
RIPLEY: Sure -- I know, that's too dangerous for you, fair enough, hey! we're brothers, fine, then you do this sordid thing with Marge, fucking her on the boat while we all have to listen, which was excruciating, frankly, plus you follow your cock around like a -- and now you're getting married! I'm bewildered, forgive me... you're lying to Marge then getting married to her, you're knocking up Silvana, you've got to play sax, you've got to play drums, which is it, Dickie, what do you really play?
