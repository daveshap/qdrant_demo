Energy subsidies and their value to the US taxpayer
Recently I heard that Congressional Republicans and the Trump admin are pushing for [new energy subsidies](https://www.forbes.com/sites/energyinnovation/2017/11/06/rick-perrys-coal-and-nuclear-subsidy-could-cost-10-billion-per-year-is-america-great-again-yet/) for the Coal and Nuclear industries. 

The [arguments](http://www.star-telegram.com/opinion/opn-columns-blogs/other-voices/article187144198.html) for these subsidies are that they are needed because abundant and cheap natural gas, combined with the expansion of renewable/green energy sector, make the energy market [uncompetitive](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-powergrid-perry/u-s-energy-head-seeks-help-for-coal-nuclear-power-plants-idUSKCN1C42G0) for coal and nuclear.


Recognizing that subsidies can be used both to [grow](https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/12/07/climate/tax-overhaul-energy-wind-solar.html) new and emerging tech, as well as shore up old tech to keep the cost of energy down for the consumer, what value would these specific subsidies represent to the US taxpayer? Is there value to saving Coal and Nuclear generated energy? What would the endgame for these subsidies, and when should/could they end? 

A tangentially related question, would ending green subsidies hurt that sector, or has it matured enough to not need the support?
