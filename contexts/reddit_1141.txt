When the day is over, let it go. Don't dwell on what you could've or should've done. Tomorrow is another day and another chance. If it's meant to be, it will come again.
No worry can change the past, it serves you no purpose to dwell on things that cant be changed.  Tomorrow is a new day and new opportunity to change how you see and live your life.  

How you chose to view the affects of your past rest purely with you and your perspective on life.  Try find the positives in what comes your way in order to break any negative trends you may have created.

When you find harmony and good in things around you, you'll find yourself.  We have to break the cycle off negativity in our lives in order to be open to the good around us.

Positivity breeds positivity.

I wish everyone happiness in all that you do.
