DYMSHITZ: Hello, Major, my name is Dymshitz. I'm glad to see you.
STEVE: Colonel. Pleasure.
DYMSHITZ: So, Major, tell me, have you questioned Dr. Furtw√§ngler?
STEVE: Not yet.
DYMSHITZ: I've had two meetings with him. He's a great musician. Maybe the greatest conductor in the world. His Brahms, Beethoven, Schubert - unequalled.
