Uni puts its full-time, permanent staff on leave while "encouraging" students & post-docs to "volunteer" in their place
I'm not entirely sure why I'm sharing this, but I guess I would like to know if I'm being completely unreasonable or what. So today it was announced that all staff in our various animal research centres have been put on leave, which means that showing up to work is pretty much voluntary for them from now on. To fill this "gap", the university is encouraging its students and postdocs to "volunteer" for essential technician work like cleaning cages, replacing food / water, and daily animal monitoring. Of course, it was made very clear that if people don't "volunteer" they would have no choice but to terminate all on-going experiments. At the risk of sounding like a douche, I really didn't sign up for a Phd to clean mouse cages and weigh out food pellets. So to my PI's dismay, I would rather leave my on-going studies for the next student, allowing me to focus on writing papers with the data I already have. It's also beyond me why my health and safety should be worth any less than that of technicians with reasonably secure permanent positions at ~2x my salary...
My initial gut reaction to this news was just anger. Anger at the university screwing over its research staff once again, because they know we'll do whatever it takes anyways.
