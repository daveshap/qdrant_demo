My department is being laid-off- what are the questions I need to be asking?
So my company is letting go 95% of personnel in my department and as the only salaried employee in the department, I'm the only one that's been guaranteed a job. However, the job is a newly created position for the sole purpose of keeping me in their organization. I told my supervisor that this makes me nervous because there is nothing stopping them from deciding the position they made up isn't valuable enough later on... I don't see how any newly created position would have good job security. Plus I would be traveling (I will be compensated for gas) which I don't love.

If I do accept this new position, it will be under the assumption that I can work on my sales skills to move into a salesperson position down the road. But that isn't necessarily what I want to be doing. Honestly I would be happy working part time and going back for my masters as well. My husband and I can live off his income alone but I don't want to leave the burden on him for any longer than absolutely necessary.

With this being said, my mind is reeling and I know I am not asking the right questions right now. If anyone has insight into my situation and the questions I should be asking my supervisor, all help is appreciated.
