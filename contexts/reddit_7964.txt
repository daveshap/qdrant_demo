Help with choosing schools! USC vs CSU Northridge
Hi everyone!

I was accepted for Fall 2020 to multiple programs for a 2-year MS in Health Administration. I am currently choosing between CSU Northridge and USC (University of Southern California). The schools are equally accredited by CAHME and both have great post-graduate employment rates.

I am holding back from accepting USC due to the cost. I would have to take out about $90,000 in federal unsubsidized loans at about a 6% interest rate. At CSU Northridge I would require NO loans and am being given $6000 in grants a year for a total of $12000. The degree would cost me under $10,000 easily.

Is the prestige of USC worth the student loan debt? How has your personal experience with student loans been?

I am the first in my family to go to graduate school and earn an undergraduate degree so I do not have much help and opinions for discussing the long terms effects of paying off loans.

I am 23 and with no undergraduate debt, also.

Thank you for the advice.
