Am I eligible to apply for the Big Four
I am a college student now, i am going to graduate this year Dec. I have already gotten accounting master degree and i am pursuing my MIS master degree right now. The GPA of both majors are above 3.75. I am the member of Beta Alpha Psi and i had some volunteer activities at campus and out of campus. However, i do not have working experiences that relating to accounting. In addition, i really do not care which city i am going to work in. 

I want to figure out if I am good enough to apply for the Big Four. Please give me some comments. Thanks.
