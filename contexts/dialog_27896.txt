HAMMER: What are you doing?
SANTA: I'm just calming the kiddies. There's no need to worry about Santa. He's just having a peaceful, adult conversation with his nice Jewish friend, The Hebrew Hammer.
HAMMER: Hey everybody. How's it hangin'?
SANTA: In fact, he's just informed me that he personally plans on cancelling Christmas this year.
