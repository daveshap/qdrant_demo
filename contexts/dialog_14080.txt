OLIVER: You're crying. Why?
THEA: I don't know. Everything's so mixed up --
OLIVER: Everything's so simple. I like you.
OLIVER: What's bothering you, Thea? Is it the General?
THEA: Sometimes when he looks at me in that strange way, I'm afraid of him.
OLIVER: Don't let it trouble you. He's an old man and these last few days have been a terrible strain on him. He won't harm you.
