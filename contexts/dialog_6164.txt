QUALEN: Where's the helicopter?
HAL: What the hell's going on?
QUALEN: That was the first and last question-- now only answers. Where's the chopper?
GABE: It can't fly in this weather.
QUALEN: This is where your background in police work comes in handy--ask the questions, Travers.
TRAVERS: Don't use my name!
QUALEN: Ask the questions.
TRAVERS: You're both with the mountain rescue team?
HAL: Yeah...
TRAVERS: Anyone else following?
TRAVERS: What's your names?
HAL: Tucker and Walker.
TRAVERS: Tucker and Walker, we've lost three bags.
QUALEN: You know how the airlines are.
GABE: Bags?
QUALEN: Suits, underwear, 100 million dollars...the usual stuff. Travers was smart enough to bring along a tracking device. Step into my office.
