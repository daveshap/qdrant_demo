HENRY: Professor?
WALDMAN: Oh God.
HENRY: They just caught the man who did it.
VICTOR: He was a frightened soul who acted out of fear and ignorance.
HENRY: They'll hang him all the same.
VICTOR: Good. I'll be there to hear his worthless neck snap.
HENRY: Keep your voice down. You don't know what you're saying.
VICTOR: It was wrong, Henry! It shouldn't have happened! The bastard deserves to die.
HENRY: You're making a scene!
VICTOR: Why Waldman? He of all people should have cheated death!
HENRY: You can't. Death is God's will!
VICTOR: I resent God's monopoly.
HENRY: That's blasphemy!
VICTOR: Blasphemy be damned! Waldman spent his life trying to help people!
HENRY: All the more reason for us to continue his work with the poor!
VICTOR: No. He had more important work.
HENRY: There are sick people who need our help. Here and now. Not in some future time. Consider that.
