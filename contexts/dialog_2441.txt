RICK: What the hell are you doing?
LARRY: I'm trying to slash my wrists.
RICK: You're trying to kill yourself with an electric razor?
LARRY: I couldn't find any razor blades.
RICK: Well, this is terrific. Now you're gonna have wrists that are smooth and kissable. Just go out there. Forget about everything and laugh it up.
LARRY: Ha, ha, ha.
RICK: No, have fun first. Then laugh. Now, forget about marriage for a while. Go party.
RICK: Gary, how we doing, big stallion?
GARY: Rick, I really think I'm in love.
RICK: This is cause for celebration. She'll probably charge half price for sex from now on.
