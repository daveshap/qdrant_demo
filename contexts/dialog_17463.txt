JOE: What a good idea.
PARRISH: Thank you. Would you like the man's name?
JOE: No.
PARRISH: If there is anything else, don't hesitate --
JOE: I won't.
PARRISH: How long have I got?
JOE: You're putting me on the spot, Bill.
PARRISH: When you go, I go.
JOE: That's the best I can do. ...but minute-by-minute, I find myself lingering.
PARRISH: ...I just saw my doctor, he told me everything was fine.
JOE: Your doctor? Did your doctor say anything about a tiny, undetectable hole in your aorta? Did he mention an irreparab- ly weak vein in the further reaches of your famous brain? Were there any prognostications about the possibil- ilites of a fatal collision on a golf cart or suffocating in an avalanche on a ski vacation in Gstaad?
PARRISH: No --
JOE: I hope you realize, Bill...in your office this morning, that was your time.
PARRISH: Closer than that.
PARRISH: Well, thank you for letting me know.
JOE: Not at all.
PARRISH: And - uh - I guess, 'goodnight'.
JOE: Good night to you, Bill.
