EdS in Higher Ed
I am thinking of pursuing my Education Specialist degree, EdS in Higher Education. But, is it worth it? The degree is 30 credit hours and can transfer into an EdD at a few other institutions, including their EdD program.

I have been gaining experience since 2015 (1 year Graduate Assistant, 3 years Residence Life, now in TRiO programs - Educational Talent Search) and have a Master of Science in Counseling - Clinical Mental Health. I have always had the goal of working in Student Affairs/higher ed and a long-term goal of teaching the subject of Higher Education/Student Affairs. While I really enjoy the work that I am currently doing, I am not in the student affairs sector, which worries me about staying abreast with current higher ed and student affairs lingo.

I think that I want to pursue a doctorate at some point but I also am afraid that if I do so now (with not a ton of experience) then I may over-qualify myself from other roles in the future. That's why I am considering EdS as kind of a mid-point degree that will give me more education that is higher ed specific. But, if I do this, then I will be in line to pursue my EdD and not a Ph.D. program. I see more people who are teaching with a Ph.D. and feel like that will set me up better to teach.

All that to say, I'm not really sure what to do. Will getting my EdD instead of Ph.D. affect my ability to become a faculty member in the future? Is getting an EdS a waste of time I could spend on doing a doctorate? Is it worth it?

Let me work it.
