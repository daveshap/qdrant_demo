Can I have a friend connect to my world without using Minecraft Realms? If I create a Minecraft world (not server) on my computer, will a friend that isn't where I am be able to play in that world? I am talking about Minecraft for PC. Note that I am only asking about a normal world, not a server. Also, this is without Minecraft realms.
