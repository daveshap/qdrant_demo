ANIMAL: You okay?
AUDREY: It's all my fault. What have I done, Animal? What have I become? Look at me. This isn't me. I don't do things like this.
ANIMAL: You made a mistake.
AUDREY: Yeah, I just screwed up with the only man who ever really cared about me.
ANIMAL: Didn't you tell me he left for the airport?
AUDREY: Yeah. Why are you asking?
ANIMAL: I just saw him. He's with a bunch of guys who want to sneak into the city tonight.
AUDREY: My God. He's going after the nest.
ANIMAL: Perfect! You wanted a story, well, baby, you got one.
AUDREY: Animal, I can't.
ANIMAL: Look, you want to make it up to your friend? Well if he's right, this is your chance.
