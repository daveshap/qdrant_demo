FORD: I just gave up smoking. A last drink?
GRENDEL: I'm running a little late. You see, I'm having a party at <u>THE</u> Club to introduce the new lead singer for Black Vomit. Everyone in the industry will be there, including our friend, Don Cleveland.
FORD: What about Don?
GRENDEL: Before Black Vomit starts its set, Don will have his head blown off. The papers next week will reveal that he was partners with Bobby, Johnny, and Collie in 'the Grendel Records scam.' He killed them to pay off a debt to 'the mob' or something lame like that. And then the mob iced him. It's all more tasteful than it sounds.
