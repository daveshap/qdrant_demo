Here's how to stand out from rest of job applicants and drastically increase your chances to get a job
Start a blog!

I know that this might sound funny, but hear me out.

I started to blog a year and a half now.  Since I always wanted to work in marketing, that's what I was blogging about - marketing.

And then, in every resume and cover letter that I sent, I mentioned that I run a blog on that topic, and leave a link.

That resulted that in 5 job offerings, and they all told me they liked my blog, and that it's on of the main reasons they invited me for an interview.

Don't hesitate.  Start a blog.  There are tons of tutorials on YouTube that'll show you how to do it in less then half hour.

And then just write about your area of work and expertise.  Just show what you (can) do.  Teach people how to do something.  Something that you already know how to do.

And don't think too much about the design, and the fonts, and all other unimportant stuff.

Just teach people.  That will show your potential employer that you really understand your craft, and you'll be in much better position that the rest of candidates.

Any of you already have a blog that helped to get a job?
