BLEEKER'S MOM: Paul? Are you coming downstairs to eat?
BLEEKER: I don't think so.
BLEEKER'S MOM: You ran eight miles today, Puppy.
BLEEKER: I'm not hungry, oddly.
BLEEKER'S MOM: But it's breakfast for supper. Your favorite, Paulie. I made French toast and sausage. Patties, not linkies, just like you like it.
BLEEKER'S MOM: Juno MacGuff called while you were out running. She wants to know if you're coming to her little coffeehouse performance on Saturday.
BLEEKER: Thanks for the message.
BLEEKER'S MOM: You know how I feel about her.
BLEEKER: You've mentioned it about fifty times.
BLEEKER'S MOM: I just hope you don't consider her a close friend.
JUNO: I have no idea how to spit this out.
BREN: Hon, did you get expelled?
JUNO: No. The school would probably contact you in the event of my expulsion.
BREN: Well, I was just asking. It seemed plausible.
MAC: Do you need a large sum of money? Legal counsel?
JUNO: No, no, I'm definitely not asking for anything. Except maybe mercy. Like, it would be really great if nobody hit me.
MAC: What have you done, Junebug? Did you hit someone with the Previa?
LEAH: Best to just tell them, man. Rip off the Band-Aid and let it bleed.
JUNO: I'm pregnant.
BREN: Oh, God...
JUNO: But I'm going to give it up for adoption. I already found the perfect people.
JUNO: They say they're going to pay my medical expenses and everything. I promise this will all be resolved in thirty-odd weeks, and we can pretend it never happened.
MAC: You're pregnant?
JUNO: I'm so sorry, you guys. If it's any consolation, I have heartburn that's like, radiating down to my kneecaps and I haven't gone number two since Wednesday. Morning!
