what keeps me going
i know it sounds babyish, but Pokemon really keeps my spirits up.
World of Warcraft, Diablo, Osu!, Overwatch, Music, and many, many other things keep me happy.
Pokemon is something I can just dl and emulator for or play online. Something that I could do on my phone. World of Warcraft is a game I've played since BC since my father started playing when I was born, it's a game I have memories with and have so many good friends I've known for 6+ years because that's when I had the confidence to talk to people. And they're around my age! We still talk but can't play together because my computer broke :( 
I find joy in videogames, and nature. 
I know this is horribly structured but it's just something I needed to say because I know my IRL friends would judge me
