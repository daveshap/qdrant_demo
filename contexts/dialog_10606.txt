CARTER: Yes, I can see your problem, Mr Kinnear.
KINNEAR: Sit down, Jack, I could weep. I really could. Sometimes I think I'll retire. Just piss off to the Bahamas and let somebody else employ them, Glenda, get Jack a drink. What is it, Jack?
CARTER: Scotch, please.
KINNEAR: Piss off, Ray.
KINNEAR: Eric told me of your bereavement.
CARTER: Yep.
KINNEAR: Do you know, I never knew he worked in one of my places!
CARTER: No? Funny that. Neither did I.
KINNEAR: If I'd known, I'd have fixed him up with something better.
CARTER: Yeah.
KINNEAR: Nasty way to go.
CARTER: Yes.
HARRY: Are we here to play cards or talk about the old days?
KINNEAR: Harry! Jack, I don't want to be rude, but these men have brought a lot of money with them. Glenda, you don't offer a man like Jack a drink in those piddling little glasses. Give him the bloody bottle. Now, where are we?
KINNEAR: Oh... I think I'll stay as I am.
HARRY: You're bluffing, you bastard!
KINNEAR: That's what you pay to find out. Right, Jack?
