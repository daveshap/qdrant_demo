Crushing
Hi, I'm (17 B) and I like a (17 F) . We know each other for some time but only for a few months I got feelings for her. I tried few times to get out with her and I tried telling her my feelings but always she politely declined with all kind of excuses. So I was trying to forget about it and move on, but recently she just kind of get in my group of friends and now we kinda spend some time together and she started to DM me in IG or answer on stories.
I also forgot to tell you that she texts back, (maybe just a bad texter, not really a problem) but I also heard that she liked a guy few weeks ago before starting to text me
What should I forget about it or make a move?
Thanks
