IRIS: It began as play. A guessing game like you play with any toddler, except these children always guessed right. And then the nightmares started. They were all different, but all the same. They were all about murder. And the murders were all happening.
ANDERTON: And how did Lamar become involved?
IRIS: Back then, he was still a DA, and quite a few parents of my patients had passed through his courtroom. You have to understand, these people were the dregs of society. But once they saw their children... he decided he would do whatever he could for them. He's that way, you know, paternal about certain things. Precrime. The precogs. You.
ANDERTON: You say some of the children died?
IRIS: So many of them... despite what we did for them. Or maybe because of what we did to them. It doesn't matter. It's a perfect system now, isn't it?
ANDERTON: I'm not a murderer. I've never even met the man I'm supposed to kill.
IRIS: And, yet, a chain of events has started. A chain that will lead inexorably to his death.
ANDERTON: Not if I stay away from him.
IRIS: How can you avoid a man you've never met?
ANDERTON: So you won't help me?
IRIS: I can't help you. No one can. The Precogs are never wrong.
