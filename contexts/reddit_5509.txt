I'm having trouble figuring out what kind of jobs I am qualified for
Hey all,

First time post on here. I'm currently in operations for a third party oilfield service company, and manage half of it. That being said, I'm 33 years old and never finished my degree. I'm working on it, but it's in English with a focus on writing. I'm about 20 credits shy. I have an AA. My current problem is that I have no idea what I'm actually qualified to do. I am miserable in my role, but have a good head on my shoulders and have managed up to 22 people at once. I am skilled with Office, and basic IT principles. I'm technically talented and test/service all of our equipment, as well as troubleshoot issues in real time. I set up our software and computers, as well as handle some logistical factors. I've even designed new builds for our equipment, and was responsible for QA/QC protocols that fixed most of our major problems.At the moment I've been looking for other jobs, but I can't exactly figure out what to look for. They say use your network, by my old network was customer service, with four years at that. My current network is all Oil and Gas, as I've been doing it for eight years. I just want to leave this industry and do something that isn't as all-consuming as this. I'm willing to take a massive pay cut to accomplish that. Any suggestions on what a person with this background could look in to would be seriously appreciated.
