JACOB: I'm telling you, don't hurt her.
SETH: As long as you're cool, she'll be cool. What're ya gonna say?
JACOB: I don't have the slightest idea.
SETH: Well, you just keep thinkin' of that gun next to Kate's temple.
SCOTT: What are you gonna do?
JACOB: I'm gonna try and get us across the border.
SCOTT: No, dad, you gotta tell 'em that they're back there.
RICHARD: This isn't gonna work.
SETH: Shut up. It's gonna work just fine,
RICHARD: I just want to go on record as saying this is a bad idea.
SETH: Duly noted. Now, shut up.
RICHARD: They're gonna search the van.
SETH: As long as you don't act like a fuckin' nut, we'll be just fine.
RICHARD: What does that mean?
SETH: What?
RICHARD: You just called me a fuckin' nut.
SETH: No, I didn't.
RICHARD: Yes, you did. You said as long as I don't act like a fuckin' nut, implying that I've been acting like a fuckin' nut.
SETH: Take a pill, kid. I just meant stay cool.
RICHARD: You meant that, but you meant the other, too.
SETH: This ain't the time, Richard.
RICHARD: Fuck those spic pigs! You called me a fuckin' nut, and where I come from, that stops the train on its tracks.
SETH: Keep your voice down.
RICHARD: Or what?
JACOB: Have you forgotten about your sister?
SCOTT: They're gonna kill us. They get us across the border, they're gonna take us out in the desert and shoot us.
JACOB: If they get over the border, they're gonna let us go.
SCOTT: Dad, I watch those reality shows. They never let anybody go. Any cop will tell you, in a situation like this, you get a chance, you go for it. This is our chance.
JACOB: What about Kate?
SCOTT: They're gonna kill her anyway. At least now with all these cops we've got a fighting chance.
JACOB: Son, I have this situation under control. I know exactly what I'm doing. You're going to have to trust me on this.
SCOTT: If trusting you means trusting those fuckin' killers, I can't do that. If you don't tell the cops, I will.
JACOB: Now, you listen to me. You ain't gonna do a goddamn fucking thing, you hear me! Nobody cares what you think, I'm running this show, I make the decisions.
SCOTT: He's running the show.
JACOB: I'm running the show. I make the plays, and you back the plays I make. Stop thinking with your fucking balls. Kate in a room with a couple of desperate men with nothing to fucking lose ain't the time to go for it." I need your cover. Cover my ass."
BORDER GUARD: How many with you?
JACOB: Just my son and I.
BORDER GUARD: What is your purpose in Mexico?
JACOB: Vacation. I'm taking him to see his first bullfight.
RICHARD: I'm curious. What was the nuttiest thing I did?
SETH: This ain't the time.
RICHARD: Oh, I know, was it possibly when your ass was rotting in jail and I broke it out? Yeah, you're right, that was pretty fuckin' nutty. Not to mention stupid. But you know what? I can fix that right now.
BORDER GUARD: What was that?
JACOB: Oh, that's just my daughter in the bathroom.
BORDER GUARD: You said it was just you and your son.
JACOB: I meant me, my son and my daughter.
BORDER GUARD: Open the door. I'm coming aboard.
