DOLORES: So, makin' dame jokes, huh, Eddie? Well, lemme remind ya pal, it was a <u>dame</u> who took a hundred bucks out of the till so your landlord would't throw you out of your dump. And it was a <u>dame</u> who trusted you for the money when no one else in town would. And it's a <u>dame</u> who's tired of waitin' for you to straighten yourself out and get a job!
VALIANT: Would this be the same dame who's going to feel awfully foolish when she finds out I've got her money.
DOLORES: This is fifty bucks. I need seventy-five before they check the books tomorrow.
VALIANT: You'll have it in the morning. Now be a sport and lemme have twenty bucks to put in my pocket.
DOLORES: Is this paper even good?
VALIANT: Check the scrawl.
DOLORES: R.K. Maroon.
