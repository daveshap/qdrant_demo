(14m) Is it bad to like makeup?
Let me preface this by saying I’m male and straight.


So tonight I was at a friends house for her birthday and we decided to play truth or dare and I ended up getting my makeup done. It wasn’t that noticeable except for my eyes but she put blush, concealer,  eyeshadow and lipstick on as well as others. And I didn’t wanna show anyone but I really enjoyed it. It made me feel really good about myself and I would definitely do it again even though I was super nervous and kind of embarrassed. Is it bad for me to like it even though I’m a boy? I’ll accept disagreement but please don’t attack me
