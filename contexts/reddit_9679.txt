Grad School in SA or Higher Ed?
I'm so conflicted. 

I'm trying to decide what avenue to pursue in terms of grad school (SA or Higher Ed). I really love working with students, but I also like the administrative side of things. I've been a student academic peer advisor during my undergrad (and seriously loved it), and now I work at a University Department part-time as a student services coordinator where I get to do a little student advising as well as many administrative duties. 

I fear that an SA degree isn't as prestigious (sorry, guys) as a higher ed degree, and I really have no interest in working in many areas of student affairs (basically only academic or career advising appeal to me). 

I found a program for a [graduate advising certificate](http://catalog.emich.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=21&poid=10724) which would only be a 2 semester commitment, and then if I wanted to, I could could focus on a longer higher education degree afterwards. 

I think this is the route that would best suite me and my interests, but I wanted to get your take on this. Especially what you think the value of this graduate certificate in advising is compared to say a masters in SA with a concentration in advising. 


I should add that I plan on talking to the academic advisor on staff in the department I work in, as she very well might know current trends in school, and what universities are looking for in advising applicants. 

Thank you for any and all insight!!
