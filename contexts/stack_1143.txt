Can we retrieve historical database growth report for MySQL? Can someone share a method on how can I retrieve the database growth report from the date of creation till current for MySQL? Coming from Oracle background, I understand for Oracle we can do a script to query the creation date or from the snapshot. But I don't now if MySQL has a similar table/view which I can query and check from.
