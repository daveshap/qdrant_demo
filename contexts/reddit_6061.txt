No Written Offer yet but it's a pandemic. Should I be worried?
I'm a new grad. An start-up that I interned for last year has verbally offered me a temporary contractor position, which, as of the last time we spoke, was still being worked out. I've sent in my updated resume to be passed on to HR, I've been talking to the person who verbally offered me the position, but the last thing I heard about it was almost two weeks ago. I know the economy is crazy right now with this pandemic, but I really want to lockdown a timeline for this job. How much longer should I wait to follow up about it again?
