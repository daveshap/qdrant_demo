So Many Men Secretly In Relationships On Dating Sites!
So the last time I was on dating sites/apps, the last 10 or so men I met online, they all secretly had a girlfriend.  I had absolutely no idea!  They pretended to be single and looking for something serious.  Several of them had a live-in girlfriend as well.

What is the deal with this?  How can I avoid these guy?!

I feel like I have to deeply online stalk any guy I'm potentially meeting with now, before we meet.  Just because I don't want to have to go through this type of thing again.

Anyone have similar experiences dating online?!
