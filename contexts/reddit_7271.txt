How does one solicit feedback from a boss that struggles with giving feedback?
My boss will tell you to your face that you’re doing a great job, **but then go behind your back and tell other people that you’re unqualified.**

I ask for feedback, and they tell me stuff and I improve on it...but they will not tell you the stuff you REALLY need to improve on, then go tell people that you struggle with those areas. How do I deal with this?
