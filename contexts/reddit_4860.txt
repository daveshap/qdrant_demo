Should I use the psychological help service that my university provides for free?
Lately I've been feeling really low. 
I can't make myself leave the bed, I start crying out of the blue and everything is just so heavy. 
I think I've always suffered from some kind of depression but I've never been to therapy because I couldn't afford it on my own and my family didn't ever suspect anything. 
Now I live on my own in another city. Yesterday I discovered that my university provides psychological help for students for free. Do you think I should give it a go? 
I'm a bit afraid because I don't know what to expect and I don't really know what to tell them when I'll be there. I know they don't provide help for very serious issues (you'll need a psychiatrist for that) and I hope they don't take care for only "university related problems".
On the other hand, I have nothing to lose because it's free.
Did you ever try anything like that?
