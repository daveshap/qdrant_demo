New role in the banking industry. Looking for training advice
I'm starting a new exciting role with a very large international bank! I start within the next few weeks. 

It's in their chief data office, project analyst position. We'll be focusing on data governance, data quality for any AML, CCAR, BCBS regulations. I have a mentor from my current firm who recently took a leadership position in a bank as well in their CDO, and her advice was 'Know the business'. 

What types of links or readings can I study up on to get a better handle on the banking 'business'. My background is in IS, so I'd like to become more banking/financially literate before I start. Any tips are helpful! :)
