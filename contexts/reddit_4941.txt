I'm terrified
I'm terrified that I'm going to spend the whole of my life wanting to die. I'm scared of suicide and don't want to attempt it, but I'm also afraid of living. 

I'm so scared of failing the people around me but I feel like I'll do that no matter what. I haven't spoken to my best mate in days (a long time for us), and I'm both terrified of losing him and of letting him down by being a burden. I just..can't pretend to be happy with him right now, but I don't want to bring him down to my level either or worry him. Hopefully he'll forget about me.... holy fuck, what if he forgets about me?

I'm afraid of becoming overwhelmed by work, but I can't seem to get myself out of bed and get the work done. I'm too scared to face it.

I'm scared of leaving my room in case I see roommates. I don't want to talk to them or for them to see me like this. I need to eat but I'm afraid of going out to buy food.

I know I'm spiraling. I know the depression is taking over. I'm terrified of that happening, but at the same time I don't know if I WANT to be in control any more. I'm too scared of that too.

Fuck. I'm just afraid. Of everything.
