Seeking a short story title that is set in the Egyptian pyramids This short story is set in one of one the pyramids of Egypt, I think. It may not seem like sci-fi, but I\u2019m pretty sure I read it in a science fiction anthology.  The narrator is part of a tour group off to tour a pyramid. As the group makes its way to the site, the narrator begins to notice fleeting images of strange creatures near the group. For example, he glimpses a baboon-like animal darting about on the face of the pyramid.Once inside the pyramid, the group goes deeper and deeper into the structure. Slowly it dawns on the narrator that perhaps they are all dead and they are descending into the underworld. He is the only one cognizant of this possibility it seems. Everyone else seems oblivious as they listen to one member of the group read text from a guide book. I think the last line of the story is something to this effect:<blockquote>  We continue to descend.</blockquote>
