Just called suicide hotline. Thanks, Tom.
I called the suicide hotline because Iâ€™ve been sad for a long time. Had enough norco to overdose and almost did. Instead, I called a suicide hotline and was connected with Tom. He coached cross country. I run cross country and track for my university. He said he is now a fan of my team and will watch for my name on the leaderboards. Thanks for giving me even the slightest reason to keep going, Tom.
