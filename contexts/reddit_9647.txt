Possible SA grad student - need your advice
Hi all,

I am an international undergraduate student in the US, and am applying for the Master's program in Student Affairs in Higher Education (or similar programs depending on the schools). Even though I'm coming in the SA program with a BBA in Actuarial Science (don't ask how or why, am sponsored for my undergraduate so kinda stuck in this major), I've worked in my university's Admissions Office since sophomore year (loved it, was why I started looking into SA) and also currently working as a part-program assistant for a volunteer group in the International Student Services office. Have also intern in education-related places (volunteered for Teach for Malaysia one summer, intern at [MACEE](http://macee.org.my) for their Fulbright/EducationUSA departments) and did a bunch of education/youth development volunteer programs like [Projek Inspirasi](http://inspirasi.avh.me) in Malaysia.

Universities I applied for (& some decisions that I've received): 

* University of Rochester (admitted, 30% tuition scholarship)
* University of Wisconsin-Madison (recommended for admission, need official transcript to finalize offer)
* Colorado State University (not invited to interview)
* Michigan State University (no results yet) 
* Anglia Ruskin University (in England, UK) (conditional offer, need minimum GPA of 3.0 by graduation next year, highly achievable).

What I'm contemplating right now is if I want to stay and pursue my Master's in the UK or in the US (if the US, I still have to decide which school, but that's a different story). Some thoughts that I consider while thinking this all out:

**1) Funding, obviously.**

While Rochester offers a 30% tuition scholarship, that will still cost me about $35,000 or so in tuition fees. For Madison, tuition cost should be roughly around the $40,000-mark or so, give an take a few thousand. Anglia Ruskin would cost me around GBP12,000, so that's around $15,000. 

I have been on a convertible loan from my country's government for my undergraduate (will probably need to pay back around 10-15% of my total costs including living expenses and all after I graduate). But for my masters, I will mostly be on personal funding (my parents agreed to help me pay for grad school) since there are not many options back home for funding for Education-related program.

**2) Time commitment**

Rochester is a two-year program. Madison is roughly 1.5 to 2 years, depending on how many credits I take per semester (30 credits for their program). Anglia Ruskin is a year-long program. While I don't mind studying for another two years, doing it in a year seems interesting but daunting at the same time.

**3) Education system**

Malaysia follows the British education system (exam-based all throughout high school), and I did A-Levels partly after high school before realizing that I hated how super exam-based it is and switched to a program and applied to the US schools for my undergrad. Super loving the US system and its flexibility, and how it offers me options I didn't know exist for me (seriously, taking a Videogames & Learning course for a Comm B requirement is awesome). But have been told that the UK Master's programs are not the same as the UK Bachelors' programs. Am planning to read up more on how the program is structured and taught, as well as talking to my friends who did Master's in the UK for their experience.

**4) Environment**

I've grown to love the US, and would love to stay and do my Master's here. Been to Rochester, loved the campus and my possible department. People are friendly, diversity is great (as a Muslim, this is highly needed). Even saw a prayer mat in the student lounge while touring and I was so excited. Madison, on the other hand, is my alma mater, and I have friends and people that I know and love. Anglia Ruskin is located in Cambridge, England, and while I've never been to Cambridge specifically, I've lived in London for 1.5 years back when I was younger, and have visited two years ago. Still have friends who are pursuing their undergraduate in England at various places, and some who will still be there if I do my Master's there next September.

The thing is, my parents are worried about me wanting to stay in the US, what with the election results and all that (as a female Muslim who wears the hijab). Personally, I've never experienced anything bad, other than that one time where a white guy suddenly yelled "F* you" in my face as I was walking back home (granted, it was 2am in the morning, and he was probably drunk). But my parents, not knowing how things would be next year (or the next two years), are super worried, which was why I actually applied to Anglia Ruskin.

**5) Visa requirements for dependents/spouse**

A little related to the funding issue, since I'm mostly going to be on personal funding. I am now on an F-1 student visa in the US, but would like to be on a J-1 visa for my Master's (mainly because if my spouse were to come and be with me, he can be on a J-2 visa and work part-time instead of staying at home and being idle for two years). But J-1 visa are typically for students sponsored by the university, by government or have substantial funding from anything other than personal (I am asking Rochester about their policy, since I have a 30% tuition scholarship and the form that I was given gave me an option to select J-1 instead of an F-1).

The UK, however, should be easier. As I will be on a Tier 4 student visa, my spouse should be able to come and stay with me (as I am doing a year-long Master's program) and he should be able to work (if I'm not mistaken, if you know more, please let me know!) 

**6) The program itself**

Rochester is one of my top choices because their program is a combination of Educational Administration w/ specialization in Student Affairs and Academic/Career Advising. As I would possibly like to be an education consultant in the future, this would work best with my interests. Madison's Student Affairs program is in their Ed Leadership & Policy Analysis (ELPA) program, which is more policy-based from what I've been told (though I plan to meet with my assigned advisor next semester to learn more and talk about options). Anglia Ruskin's program has a focus on international/national student affairs, which is interesting for an international student like me. It'd be interesting to see things from different countries' perspectives, and would be beneficial considering it can help me adapt to different situations, especially if I go back home and work with students who are interested to apply to schools outside of my home country. Anglia Ruskin also has a possible internship opportunity to work in the US (summer internship?) if I want to apply for it, which would also be fun.


--------

So that's just some of the thoughts I have at the moment. I would be meeting my family next week for a winter trip, and should be discussing all of the options with my parents (after all, they are paying for my education).

At this point, I'm just going through all the pros and cons in my head (and talking it out with my friends to help me think clearly), but I would appreciate any thoughts, suggestions, and ideas from anyone who has any experiences in any of these programs, or know more about the UK vs US thing.

Early thanks. :)
