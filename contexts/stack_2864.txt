Day/Year Length Of Larger, but same mass, Earth? I\u2019m wondering how the length of a day and year would change on Earth if it was twice as big, but the same mass (less density)?Also, would such a difference cause it to orbit closer or further from the sun, or the same?I found plenty of people asking this same question, though with a more massive Earth, but my curiosity has been piqued.
