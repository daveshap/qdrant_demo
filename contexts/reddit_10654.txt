I think I'm gonna die
I looked it up and the safest dose is 3000mg of acetaminophen, I took 8000mg of it, I know it takes hours for it to work, but it happened, I don't know why I did other than I want the pain to stop, so I guess I'm just on Reddit for the next while, and trust me, I know it will take days, I just hope I can hide the pain
