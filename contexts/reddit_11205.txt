My life has literally fallen down around me. Hope it's for the best.
Had a high risk pregnancy, had babe via c section because he flipped somewhere between 37 and 38 weeks which was traumatic enough, he was diagnosed with ftt (failure to thrive) at about two months, then I had my gallbladder out at 4 months post partum which took double the amount of time and I needed a drain.

I have sensory issues with touch and all of this was fucking hell two invasive and full on surgeries in four months plus a failed breastfeeding journey. 

I also failed my first year of uni due to all of that. It was ambitious to try, but I didn't expect any of it. 


Through the pregnancy my (now ex) partner wasn't as supportive as I needed him to be and became low key emotionally manipulative and abusive. It got worse post babe and gave him a year to sort his shit out. 

We're at the year mark now and I've ended it after 8.5 years and an 18 month old babe. 

I tried uni again this year and managed to pass two topics. First semester was a wreck due to my (ex)partner and all his emotional shit, which is where I passed two topics. I was then precluded from studying second semester because I failed two topics, two years in a row and didn't provide proof (I giggle now because I didn't get any of the letters until I finished half the semester and did almost 50% of the work for all my topics). 


So. I'm living at my parents with 0 income, 20% care of my babe (which will change soon), and just feeling like I'm at the bottom of anything and everything. 

It all fucking sucks but I hope this is the start of some sort of good something.
