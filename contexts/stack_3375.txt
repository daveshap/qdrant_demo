90s cartoon about guardians against nightmares In the 1990s, I saw an animated show about some guardians of dreams that protect children\u2019s dreams against nightmares. I dont remeber much, only that they travel in pillow-like space ship and there was a rule that the kid can\u2019t wake up because they die or something. Does anybody know this show?
