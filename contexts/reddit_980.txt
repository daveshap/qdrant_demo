Is there anyone else who feels like everyone finds them annoying?
Your friends, your coworkers, your family...

And all you're trying to do is be kind, be funny, express your love, try and be loved back.

You're just trying to be less lonely. Yet it seems like everyone can't stand you. Either it's true or you're paranoid, neither is good for the mind and soul.
