OLD MAN: What do you want me to do? Pick up after five dogs? I'm eighty-three years old. God in his heaven understands that I cannot pick up after five dogs.
FELIX: You have too many dogs.
OLD MAN: Lucy. There are big things going on in my house. My granddaughter Loretta, the only daughter of my son Cosmo, has engaged herself to be married a second time.
LUCY: I have heard that Johnny Cammareri got down on his knees in The Grand Ticino and proposed to her.
OLD MAN: My son does not like this Johnny Cammareri. He says he is a big baby.
