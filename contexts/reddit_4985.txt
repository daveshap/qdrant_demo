I do not know what to do anymore and I honestly just legitimately don’t want to be alive anymore
I’ve never been diagnosed with depression, but I definitely have been depressed for a very long time and I’m honestly coming to realize that things have honestly never really been that great and I honestly just don’t think I’m down to be alive, when I think about everything and what it would take to get there, it just doesn’t seem worth it to me, I am loosing all of my friends and finding it extremely hard to go out and do things and have normal interactions, I graduated higher school last year and instantly started loosing myself, during high school I actually thought I might have a chance of getting better and feeling happy, but I really think now that I just don’t wana be happy, it litterally is harder to be happy than sad now a days, thanks if you read this, let me know what you think, I know these are problems everyone have but no advice or suggestions are helping and I just don’t know
