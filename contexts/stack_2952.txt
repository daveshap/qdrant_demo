Grounding secondaries in isolation transformer In an isolation transformer (I assume a 220v-110v step down transformer is also called an isolation transformer), you can ground either of the secondary leads. I'd like to know the following:If you ground one lead, and short the other lead to that ground (Or connect both leads to ground).. would this trip the breaker or since it is an isolation transformer and the current is limited by the core size.. then it can't trip the breaker? If you touch any lead of the isolation (step down) transformer, you are not supposed to get electrocuted.. but if you touch both leads.. would you be electrocuted or still not?
