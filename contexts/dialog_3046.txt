BRUCE: They're overly protective. You're Not going to hurt me are you, Ms...
PAMELA: Dr. Pamela Isley.
BRUCE: What can I do for you, Doctor? A research grant? A hospital wing?
PAMELA: Actually, I already work for you. Or did. Your arboreal preservation project in South America.
BRUCE: We cut our support. A conflict of ideologies. Dr. Woodrue was a lunatic.
PAMELA: I see you knew him.
BRUCE: That lab was consumed by fire last week. how did you manage to escape?
PAMELA: I have here a proposal showing how Wayne Enterprises can immediately cease all actions that toxify our environment.
PAMELA: Forget the stars. Look here, at the Earth, our mother, our womb. She deserves our loyalty and protection. And yet you spoil her lands, poison her oceans, blacken her skies. You're killing her.
BRUCE: Your intentions are noble, but no diesel fuel for heat. No coolants to preserve food. Millions would die of cold and hunger alone.
PAMELA: Acceptable losses in a battle to save the planet.
BRUCE: People come first, Dr. Isley.
