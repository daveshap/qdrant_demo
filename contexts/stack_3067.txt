Can't Determine the direction of rotation of a coil Speaking of coils and torque here, So I have a coil and after I did fleming's right hand rule to get the direction of the torque (let it be the positive x-axis unit vector \u00ee can't remember it correctly) I was asked to get it's direction of rotation: whether it is clockwise or anti-clockwise.What I tried is handling segments of the coil separately to know the direction of rotation but that didn't help me much as the coil was on xy plane, I kept imagining it but I can't figure out if its clockwise or anti I mean it depends whether I look at it from the right or the left, I also tried right hand screw rule but It made no sense to me, at last I tried to look it up on Internet but didn't really find any results so I head over here in hope I get help.Thank youEdit(2):I am not allowed to post pictures, and not familiar with mathjax I use the app on my phone I will try to describe one of the two problems I am talking about:Rectangular coil of 20 turns and an area of 0.005 square meters, carrying current of 10A, Its hinged along the y-axis and mounted on XY plane at an angle of 30 degrees to a uniform magnetic field of 0.5 tesla, Find the torque vector and the direction of rotation of the coil. So the coil has one long side on y and one short side on x (axis) the direction of current is also given So tau=NI AxB is what I did after resolution of B into a vector and what I got was 4.33*10^-3 (-y axis unit vector)But I am struggling with the direction of rotation for the coil
