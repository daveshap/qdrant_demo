COVID Crushed My Career, What do I do now?
Hey folks, the gist is this:   
I'm an entertainment lighting specialist. Primarily I work as a lighting director operating consoles and putting up rigs for concerts, festivals, theatre etc. For the last 2ish years I've had steady work, primarily in touring family entertainment shows. Last year I made about 60k before taxes. Its my dream job, I'm good at it and I love it.

  
In March, my current tour, future tours, and plan B local gigs all vanished with the pandemic. I have booked one weekend gig for the foreseeable future, in the season I'm normally working 80 hours a week. I have robust savings because I've always known my job to be feast or famine, and government aid plus EI will keep me afloat for a good amount of time. However, I can't help but feel like the entertainment industry will take years to get even close to what it was. Shows that actually pay enough to be worthwhile need big audiences, big venues, and most notably, big insurance policies that currently no one is giving out. It's also extremely hard work. On tour I'll work an average of 100 hours a week, sometimes we'll do 14 show days in a row.   


I'm computer savvy, I have basic programming and networking knowledge, should I be going back to school for a basic CS/Networking diploma and get myself out of this? Pursue a trade maybe? I don't want to throw away a career I spent 6 years building but I can't just wait and see what happens while my savings ebb away. 

TLDR: Chosen field of work has ceased to exist during the pandemic, do I wait it out or abandon ship?
