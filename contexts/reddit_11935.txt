My Future Is Looking Bleak
I have terrible grades, I started caring about school too late, even though I love to learn.  I'm worried I wont go anywhere in life.  I have high aspirations, as I've loved the world of high finance for years now.  Id like to be a successful financier, but its looking like I'll end up much less successful.
