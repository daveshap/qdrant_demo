Scrolling doesn't work in Terminal for commands like less I used to be able to scroll using the trackpad through git diff or man pages which both use less when the output doesn't fit on screen. Today I restarted my computer and that behaviour is gone and I can no longer scroll down and if I scroll up it scrolls the terminal scrollbar showing previous commands. However in vim scrolling still works as expected.The first thing I checked is the \"Scroll alternate screen\" Terminal setting and it is checked as expected. I also tried with iTerm2 and have the same issue even with the \"Scroll wheel sends arrow keys when in alternate screen mode\" setting enabled.My default shell is zsh so I tried with bash and then sh. Both have the same behaviour and I can't scroll through the output.Because scrolling still works with some commands like vim it seems like the issue might be that less is no longer recognized as an \"alternate screen\" but I have no idea why. Updating to the latest less version available on brew did not help.
