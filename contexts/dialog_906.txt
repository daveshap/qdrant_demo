SYKES: Move a finger, Harcourt, and you're history...
HARCOURT: No, Sergeant -- not history... Eternity...
JETSON: With Harcourt and Kipling dead, I assume you will be requesting reassignment now.
SYKES: It'd be for your own good. I think you'd be better off with a partner who's a little more... by the book. ... Still, I gotta tell you, George, for a quiet guy, you're sure hell on wheels once you get going. I'd kinda hate to miss your next two days as a detective.
