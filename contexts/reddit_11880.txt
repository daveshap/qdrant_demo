I cut 1 corner and jeopardized my future
I've been in a program to commission as an officer for my entire college career. We've never had a drug test before, so I thought over the winter break I could get away with a little fun. I was wrong. 

My luck, we had our first test. And apparently I didn't give enough time. It all sucks so much, knowing I didn't hurt anyone or steal anything and still, it all being my fault, for not following a rule no matter how stupid it is. 

Now I am going to get kicked out. Just because I dropped the ball one time. I can't get over this honestly. It's been a month since I found out and I am just barely functioning - getting terrible grades and unable to do anything beyond that and drinking. 

Life feels like it is over for me because I cannot think of a career path that'd be nearly as rewarding for my likes - traveling and career versatility (doing different jobs like foreign affairs or logistics, etc.). 
I remain optimistic that eventually I can find something that'll be as rewarding...but with the amount of time it'll take...it's hard to stay focused and enjoy the present.
