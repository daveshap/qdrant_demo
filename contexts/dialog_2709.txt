BUCKAROO BANZAI: All accounted for? Where's Penny?
PERFECT TOMMY: New Jersey brought her back to the bus through heavy fire. Quite a guy if you want my opinion.
BUCKAROO BANZAI: Got a casualty list?
RENO: Just their side. What're we gonna do with these people? They're illegal aliens, the way I figure, been here forty years, you could throw the book at 'em...
BUCKAROO BANZAI: And ask the American taxpayer to foot the bill? No way. Send 'em back to the Eighth Dimension as soon as we find the Overthruster. It wasn't in Penny's purse...so if we have to run this joint upside down and inside out...
