How to act in a office?
Hello all!

I started working in a office since this Monday. I am a customer service representative and it’s my first desk job. When I came in, I found out my boss was going to be gone for this week and he said he’ll “probably be back next week.” This is really weird to me and I was basically anxious these past few days. I’m so used to a boss being around, telling me when to take breaks, and being introduced to the people there. My boss had to teach my about my job over the phone. I kept asking people around the office if I work with them, if they’ve interacted with my boss before( didn’t find any information), and then people there were not really explaining about parking or the free food. Since I am a anxious person, I try to talk to people around me but they don’t seem interested. So I was wondering how do I act in a office especially since I’m the only employee of my bosses company. I already have views about this desk job and it’s boring, pays good, but I’m not sure if this is what I want.
