MRS. MAYER: I hear this Michael fellow is schizophrenic.
LETTY: Mom, please.
MRS. MAYER: Don't forget that Paul's a promising young attorney who loves you very much...
LETTY: Mom, look, if I want to dump Paul, I'll dump him. If I want to screw Michael or live with him or marry him, then I'll do that.
MRS. MAYER: I'm only looking out for you.
LETTY: And if I want to smoke, I'll fucking smoke.
