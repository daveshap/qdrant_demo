To everyone who feels they need to defend their school...
I've scrolled through so many posts on here with people being excited about going to school or committing or getting in. and then someone asks, "what school?" and this person says the school (and it isn't a T20) and then feels a need to rationalize why they are excited.

GUYS!

we shouldn't be making anyone feel insecure about where they're going or where they want to go. so many people don't get a shot a college and even fewer are ever offered the opportunity to attend. let's make this a space where everyone can be proud of where they are going off to college whether that be ivy or a local community college. 

Just the fact that you're into a college or committed or whatever is  AMAZING . do not let the jealous angry people on here make you feel less than. and to that jealous person, grow up. no one wins anything from anyone's loss.
