How do I politely say I want to wait to hear other offers?
I have a meeting tomorrow with a professor who seems to really want to give me an RA position for my graduate studies. However, I’m still waiting to hear back from other graduate schools. If he says “I want to pay your tutition and give you this stipend” I would probably go with him, but I don’t want to limit that. How to I politely say, I’m very interested but I want to wait to hear back from my other programs before I decide. I don’t want him to offer that to someone else just because it seems like I’m not interested.
