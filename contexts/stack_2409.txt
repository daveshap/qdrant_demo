How to filter OSM data spatially (more complex than by polygon/bounding box)? Tools like osmosis, osmfilter, or osmconvert allow just clipping data to a defined bounding box or a polygon (besides filtering by attributes).What is the best way to delete all objects inside multiple defined areas? In other words: I want do do an erase operation on OSM data.Is there a simpler way than importing OSM data to a database, processing there and writing back to a file?
