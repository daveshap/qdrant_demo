Given the SSD performance hit due to the Meltdown/Spectre patches, is it a good idea to buy more RAM to make RAM disk? Under Ubuntu, how much performance gain will the RAM disk provide over the normal nvme m.2 SSD? Could you please let us know what is the effective size of extra RAM to get to make RAM disk's performance optimal? Is 32GB a good amount? How do I create and remove RAM disk? Thanks.
