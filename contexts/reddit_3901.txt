Sincerely,

A increasingly confused and frustrated guy

Made this today during the time on which I should have been on a date had I not been stood up once again. Figured I'd put my frustration to use with something so that you guys can have a laugh either with me or at me.

In all seriousness though, I am doing my very best to keep any frustration and jadedness out of my interactions but it's getting harder and harder. It's starting to look like I'm going to have to take a break.

Why do girls agree to a date enthusiastically and then either ghost or just not show up? What would be the harm in saying "sorry I'm not interested" and unmatching? At least we wouldn't be wasting each other's time!

Since I started seriously doing the online dating thing 2 months ago, I've had 21 girls agree to a date in principle. Of those, 1 has come through. 12 have flaked (even though 10 of those confirmed they were in fact coming the morning of and just never did) and 8 have just stopped replying when asked when they were free. I mean just... why? I see girls complaining in their profiles all the time that they're looking for someone who's serious, that they want someone to finally take them on a date, someone who makes plans and sticks to them. These are the same people who then turn around and mess me around instead of just letting me know they're not interested when I ask them to meet up. 

And I get what people say about why people ghost, but the fact is most of these situations we haven't had each other's social media, numbers, last names, addresses or anything like that. Even if I did blow up and go psycho on them (which I absolutely wouldn't) it would be a matter of unmatching and that would be that!

Edit: Thanks for the silver & gold kind Reddit strangers! Not sure what I did to deserve it but it's appreciated regardless!
