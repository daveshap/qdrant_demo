What is the evidence that cutting corporate tax rates will benefit workers, instead of profits?
Today the White House released [their details](https://www.whitehouse.gov/taxreform?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=wh_20171013_na) on how their proposed tax plan of cutting the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20% [would boost incomes for workers by $4,000.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/cutting-corporate-taxes-to-20-would-boost-workers-income-white-house-says-1508144400?mod=e2tw)

I would like to know what stats, studies, and facts there are to either back this idea (cutting corporate tax rates) up, or refute it. 

Another question I have is, historically, how have corporations in the United States handled tax cuts (if there have been any)? Did most of that money go to the workers, or did it go towards the CEO and profits?
