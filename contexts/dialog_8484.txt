ED: Erin -- lemme tell you something. If I'da put three researchers on this, I wouldn't expect them to dig up all the information you got here. This is some damn good work.
ERIN: Yeah? Then gimme another raise.
ED: Hey, I got a staff to pay, plus rent, plus I haven't billed a minute of my time since I started on this case, so you can quit hitting me up like I'm rich or something.
ERIN: Don't give me that. You're gonna get plenty rich off of this, Mr. 40 percent. We got those PG&E fuckers by the balls here.
ED: We've got the PG&E fuckers in Hinkley by the balls. But nobody's getting rich unless we can pin this on the corporate PG&E fuckers in San Francisco.
ERIN: What do you mean?
ED: PG&E corporate is claiming they had no way of knowing what was going on in Hinkley.
ERIN: Oh, they knew. They had to know.
ED: Show me the document that proves that.
ED: Then they didn't know. And if they didn't know, we can't hit 'em for punitive damages. And punitive damages is where the money is.
ERIN: Jesus Christ, Ed -- you know, the more I work on this thing, the more I realize what a crock of shit this legal system is. Here we got a company that poisoned a whole aquifer -- that built a pool for a town, then filled it with toxic water -- and <u>we're</u> the ones who've gotta bust our ass proving things? That's just not right.
ED: I like this case.
ERIN: Really? It makes me sick.
ED: Me too. That's why I like it. It's been a long time since I had a case I cared about.
ERIN: You didn't care about my case?
ED: I would now.
ED: Hey. I like working with you.
ERIN: Well, good, Ed. I like working with you too.
