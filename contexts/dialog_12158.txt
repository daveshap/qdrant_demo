LOOSELEAF: I told you the uniform wouldn't help.
HAROLD: It helped more than you know. Down deep, people were deeply affected.
LOOSELEAF: You keep on saying deep" and "deeply." I wish something good would happen on the surface sometime."
SHUTTLE: I can't get over how you guys are my friends. Harold Ryan and Looseleaf Harper are my friends.
HAROLD: Our pleasure.
SHUTTLE: Eight years you guys were together-- through thick and thin.
HAROLD: For seven and a half of those years we were heavily drugged--or we would have been home long before now, believe me. We were saved from starvation by the Lupi-Loopo Indians, who fed us a strange blue soup.
SHUTTLE: Blue soup.
HAROLD: It sapped our will--made us peaceful and unenterprising. It was a form of chemical castration. We became two more sleepy Indians.
LOOSELEAF: So, kid--how they hanging? Or don't you say that to a little kid?
HAROLD: He's a man. Tell him you're a man.
PAUL: I'm a man.
HAROLD: We've got to do something to make this boy's voice change. I wonder if we couldn't get bull balls somewhere, and fry 'em up. Still miss your mother?
PAUL: No.
HAROLD: You're free to go to her, if you want. If you'd rather be a woman and run with the women, just say the word.
SHUTTLE: Are we really going to find out where the elephants go to die?
HAROLD: I'd rather go to Viet Nam.
SHUTTLE: Would somebody please pass me the catsup?
HAROLD: What you say is, Pass the fucking catsup.""
SHUTTLE: Pass the fucking catsup.
