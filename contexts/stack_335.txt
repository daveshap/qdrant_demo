How to get the path associated to a favorite in Finder? I have some favorites in Finder (10.11.4) and I can't open some of them:<blockquote>  \"Folder name\" can't be opened because the original item can't be found.</blockquote>The folder can't be open because it is on an unmount volume. The problem is I don't know what is this volume and I would like to know the path associated to this favorite. I can't get this information with right click on the favorite, it is not listed in the Finder preferences and the information is not present in the plist file.Where can I get this information?
