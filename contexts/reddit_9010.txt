Are Israeli's settlements necessary to protect it's interests?
I've been having trouble finding concrete reasons why people are settling there in the first place. The most common explanation I've heard is that they do it for religious [reasons.]
(https://www.cnn.com/2017/02/01/middleeast/settlements-explainer/index.html)
The entire UN security counsel (except the US) has declared the settlements to be [illegal.] (https://www.un.org/press/en/2016/sc12657.doc.htm)
Another explanation for the settlements is that they allow the IDF to deter terrorist [groups.] (https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2016/12/29/507377617/seven-things-to-know-about-israeli-settlements) "The settlers and their supporters cite the Jewish Bible, thousands of years of Jewish history, and Israel's need for "strategic depth" as reasons for living in the West Bank."
Are these settlements necessary for Israel to protect its interests and people?
