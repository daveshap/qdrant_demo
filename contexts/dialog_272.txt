CATES: Where's the money?
HAMMOND: In the trunk of a car. A lot better than under a mattress, right?
CATES: Right, partner.
HAMMOND: Get this. We ain't partners. We ain't brothers. We ain't friends. If Ganz gets away with my money, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
CATES: Yeah. Right.
CATES: Where's the goddamn car?
HAMMOND: You're a real case, you know that, Jack?
HAMMOND: This'll show you how smart I am. I got it parked.
CATES: ...For three years? Let's hope it wasn't a tow-away zone.
HAMMOND: You just drove by it.
