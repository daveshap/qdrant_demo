Am I qualified for this position?
Hello everyone, thank you for taking the time to help me out.

I am 23 years old, with a B.S. in Industrial Technology. The field I'm looking to get into right now is Project Management, but I don't think I have the required qualifications and don't know what my entry level options are.

For background, I spent three years as a package handler for a major shipping corporation while I was in school. My schedule prevented me from becoming a manager.

Prior to this, I spent four of my summers as a science camp tutor/counselor, and later as an instructor.

Currently, I'm with a national service program for a year doing disaster relief. A chunk of this work is related to project management, but I don't have much input as to what work I get to do.

This is a job I applied to. I don't feel I'm qualified, and worse enough, I don't know what the pay is:
