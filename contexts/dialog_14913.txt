JIM: No, she could get hurt. If you believe what's happening to these other people.
NUMA: She's the best damn witness we have!
JIM: I just don't want to do it. What else?
NUMA: Hate mail here. Fan mail here. The bad news is the IRS has just requested an audit on your income from this office.
JIM: I expected that two months ago, and they're wasting their time... The bad news is the National Guard has just asked me to resign after 18 years. Well, maybe that's good news - it was never as good as combat, but this is. Bill, any more on Oswald and Shaw?
BILL: Yeah. They were seen together in Clinton in early September. The Civil Rights Movement was running a voter registration drive.
BILL: ...rumor is Shaw, a local boy, was working on some arms deal to discredit the civil rights movement. No one really knows what they were doing there, but everyone sure saw 'em. They stood out like cottonballs. I got whites and blacks saw 'em, but last time I checked there was nothing illegal with registering to vote. We still got the Negro junkie, Vernon Bundy, saw 'em talkin' at the seawall near Lake Pontchartrain. But it's tough, boss - no one wants to talk about Shaw. He's...
LOU: You know you keep saying that.
BILL: Keep saying what?
LOU: You're not digging.
JIM: I think Clinton is a breakthrough. Shaw denies he knows Ferrie or Oswald. Is that right? It proves he's a liar. Keep on it, Bill.
SUSIE: This is interesting - are you ready for this? Oswald went to see the FBI two weeks before the assassination. It seems Special Agent Hosty made three routine visits to his house, supposedly to keep an eye on Marina Oswald.
