MATT: It's all right. Thanks.
DICKSON: And what's more, keep up the good work and who knows - some day you'll be the fellow sitting behind that desk . . . Not a bad thought, eh?
DICKSON: What's the matter? You don't seem very excited about it.
MATT: Sure, I think it's swell.
DICKSON: Say, come on. Show a little enthusiasm. What's the matter? Are you sick or something? Go on, fake it - even if it isn't real.
MATT: Aw, I'm sorry, Mr. Dickson. It's just kind of sudden, that's all. Sure, I'm excited. I think it's great. Only, well, you've done so much for me already . . . I'll never be able to thank you enough.
DICKSON: Aw, go on, forget it. You came through, didn't you? That's all I wanted. A lot of them didn't think you would. You don't know how much satisfaction it's been to me. It's been swell. Well, when are you and Helen going to get married?
MATT: Well, Iâ€”
DICKSON: I suppose you want me to fix that up for you too, eh?
DICKSON: Well, look who's here! Hello, dear.
MRS. DICKSON: Hello, darling.
DICKSON: If this isn't a red-letter day for Tom Dickson! First I trample on the Board of Directors, then I promote Matt here to assistant cashier, and now to complete the day I have a visit from my sweet and lovely and gorgeous wife. What a man, what a man!
MRS. DICKSON: It's amazing that your sweet, lovely, gorgeous wife can ever get to see you.
DICKSON: Oooh! That has the earmarks!
