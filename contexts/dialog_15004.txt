MARK: I'm leaving Vanessa.
JUNO: What?
MARK: It's just not working out, but I'm getting my own place in the city... and I've got it all planned out. It's something I've wanted to do for a long time...
JUNO: No.
MARK: No?
JUNO: No. No, you definitely cannot do that, Mark. That's a big, fat sack of no!
MARK: What's the matter?
JUNO: This isn't what we agreed on. You guys have to take care of... this! You are the chosen custodians of the big-ass bump!
MARK: But I thought you'd be cool if...
JUNO: I want you guys to adopt the Buglet. I wanted everything to be perfect. Not shitty and broken like everyone else's family. Listen, once I have the baby, Vanessa is going to finally be happy, and everything will be all right. Believe me on this one!
MARK: A baby is not going to fix everything. Besides, I don't know if I'm ready to be a father.
JUNO: But you're old!
MARK: I... How do you think of me, Juno? Why are you here?
JUNO: I don't know. I just liked being your friend. I sort of liked becoming furniture in your weird life.
MARK: This... ...this is what my life has become. Stuff in boxes. Stuff underground. Is that so appealing to you?
JUNO: Yeah, I guess... Is this my fault? Is Vanessa mad at you because of me?
MARK: That's not the point. We're just not in love anymore.
JUNO: Yeah, but didn't you love Vanessa when you married her? If you love someone once, you can love them again, I know it. My friend Leah has gone out with the same guy, like, four times. You're just not trying.
