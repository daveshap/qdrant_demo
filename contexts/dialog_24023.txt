VIKTOR: Thank you! I don't know how you did it but thank you.
ELAINE: Don't thank us too fast, Viktor. You know what we have to do?
VIKTOR: Why stop at one character when you can have a whole cast?
ELAINE: Exactly. Now that you have the studio behind you, we can really do things.
ELAINE: I was thinking -- what about you and... Simone" moving back in with me and Lainey?"
VIKTOR: That sounds wonderful. How do you feel about all this, Lainey?
LAINEY: About you and mom?
VIKTOR: Me and Simone. What I did.
LAINEY: Your mistake wasn't making something fake, daddy. We're fine with fake -- as long as you don't lie about it.
ELAINE: Don't look so glum, Viktor. It's not a death sentence.
VIKTOR: No... it's life.
FRANK BRAND: -- Simone, the question on everyone's mind is simply... why?""
SIMONE: Frank, you know as well as I do, living in a fish bowl, the insatiable appetite of the media...
SIMONE: With everything that was going on in my life, I just needed to drop out of sight for a while -- I needed time. Viktor bought me that time. I owe him so much.
FRANK BRAND: We all do. But now I understand you're eager to get back to work -- and not the kind of work that we're all expecting.
SIMONE: That's true. I can reveal that I am considering a career in politics.
FRANK BRAND: And what may I ask brought this on?
