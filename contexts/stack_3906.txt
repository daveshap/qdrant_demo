Questions on issues with using Frequentist and Bayesian approach for the same test One quick stats question, if I use Binomial Cumulative Distribution Function to get a sample size n for desired confidence level and tolerable error. Then we pick a sample of sample size n and find k failures in the sample. Is it ok for us to use Jeffreys Interval instead of the exact method (clopper Pearson interval) for getting the upper limit of the estimated failure rate in the population? My concern is that the sample size is obtained using Frequentist while the Jeffreys Interval is Bayesian approach. So can we still draw conclusion on the upper limit of the estimated failure rate with a conference level?
