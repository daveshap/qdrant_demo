Anyone else suffer from depression too and have to decide whether or not to drink coffee because it’s a choice between my anxiety being worse or being exhausted all day?
Holy crap I didn’t think this would get this far up there, thanks everybody it’s good to know I’m not alone. I’m sorry you guys have to experience this too though, I wish I could answer all the comments but just know I’ve read them all and they’re all appreciated! This sub is a fantastic group of people.
