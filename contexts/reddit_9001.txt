What are the proposed ways to pay for Medicare for All? Are they viable?
A recent study shows that Sen. Bernie Sanders' [Medicare for All bill] (https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/1804/text) will cost [32.6 Trillion over 10 years.] (https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/study-medicare-bill-estimated-326-trillion-56906940) Sanders has [disputed the conclusion] (https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/study-medicare-bill-estimated-326-trillion-56906940) saying “This grossly misleading and biased report is the Koch brothers response to the growing support in our country for a ‘Medicare for all’ program.” Is there a viable way to pay for this?
