Better lay her off before she has babies...
My boss just informed me that they can “no longer afford to pay me full time, therefore, they’re outsourcing my position”.  Whatever. I get it, being a boss for a small start up company is difficult and you have to cut corners when you don’t necessarily want to. I was their longest, most stable employee...but I digress. 

What really pisses me off is that they said to my coworker “well...it wasn’t an easy decision, but it’s for the best. Plus she was probably going to start having a family soon so...”. 

I’m quite sure it’s illegal to lay someone off because you assume they’re going to be starting a family soon. What would you do? 

I’m in the U.S. btw.
