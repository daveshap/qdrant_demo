SEBASTIAN: What time is it?
NIGHT DOORMAN: Eight o'clock. You got to go.
SEBASTIAN: Did she show up?
NIGHT DOORMAN: Nope.
SEBASTIAN: Do you mind if I check upstairs?
NIGHT DOORMAN: I can't have you do that, nor can I have you hanging around the lobby all day.
SEBASTIAN: I understand. Thanks for letting me crash here.
NIGHT DOORMAN: Don't worry about it.
