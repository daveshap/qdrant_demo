Working 2 full time jobs. How to avoid burnout?
Long story short, Job#1 barely supplements a livable wage. I also have about 10k worth of debt. I’m learning how to manage money better but I’m at the point where I want to get the hell out of my family home. I figured it would be way better to alleviate the debt first, while also learning to handle my money better, before setting off on the path of independence.

I decided to pick up a second job, and it turns out it’s full time. I was unaware of the schedule because I was getting two different responses from the HR and the manager. So I’ve pretty much doubled my income which is just fine. I’ll be making about 3500 a month, and figured after the monthly bills, I can have the debt paid off in 3-4 months, and another 3-4 months worth of saving for a nest egg once the current lease is up. (I’m on the lease with a parent). My hours are pretty much sun up to sun down (17 hours), roughly 5 hours of sleep in between days. I have no days off, aside from 2 mornings and 2 evenings off (spread across 4 days). I’d like to keep both jobs for at least 6 months, losing the second job is not the end of the world, but it will delay my financial goals considerably. I’m afraid that this mindset will lead me to quit the second job once this motivation inevitably dissipates during times of weakness. So my questions are as follows:
