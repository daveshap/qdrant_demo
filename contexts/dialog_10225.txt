KATE: We have to go back for Daddy!
SETH: Daddy's dead.
KATE: Noooo!
SCOTT: He's right, Kate. Daddy's dead! He was too far away. If flinging that door and filling this room with those bat-things would save him, I'd fling it. The only thing it'll do is turn us into one of them.
SETH: He needs our help!
SCOTT: He's beyond our help. You saw him get bit. I saw him get bit. We all saw it. You can't help him. I've got no one left to lose but you. I can't be alone again. We're sticking together.
