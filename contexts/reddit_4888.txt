It’s like I’m not allowed to feel this way
Recently, my depression symptoms have been worse. My mom brought me to the doctor and because I’m too afraid to open up, my trash doctor thinks I’m faking so he told me to smile more and think positive. Now my father thinks like my doctor and every time I’m feeling down, he becomes angry at me for feeling that way when I can’t help it. It’s like I’m not allowed to be depressed. Nobody understands my pain. But I understand because I never fully opened up. Any advice for handling my situation?
