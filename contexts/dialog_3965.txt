ADAM: I went to Sophie's and she was very hospitable.
EVE: Is that what you call it?
ADAM: But it just wasn't where I wanted to be so I left as politely as I could and found a taxi. But I asked the driver to drop me here instead of at the hotel. There's a song Mister Como sings called On the Street Where You Live." You know it?"
EVE: Sing it to me.
ADAM: All at once am I--several stories high-- knowing I'm--on the street-- where you live." It's about a young man who is overjoyed just to be standing in front of the house of the person he loves."
EVE: Adam...dumb question, but humor me. Have you ever had sex before?
ADAM: No.
