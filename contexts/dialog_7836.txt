PAUL: What's gotten into Gurney? He's not faking. Paul presses forward and the fight moves quickly around the room. The smell of ozone grows stronger as the shields hit and SPARK off one another. Paul directs a parry downwards, turns, and leads Gurney against the table, plunging at just the right moment to pin Gurney against the table top with his blade right at Gurney's neck.
PAUL: Is this what you seek?
GURNEY: Good... the slow blade penetrates the shield... but look down.
GURNEY: We'd have joined each other in death. However, you did seem to finally get the mood"."
PAUL: Would you really have drawn my blood?
GURNEY: If you'd fought one whit below your abilities I'd have scratched you a good one.
PAUL: Things have been so serious here lately.
GURNEY: Yes. I sensed the play in you lad, but this can no longer be play. Tomorrow we leave for Arrakis! Arrakis is real. The Harkonnens are real.
