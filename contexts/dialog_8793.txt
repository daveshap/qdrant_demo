ARTHUR: Your deeds set an example for all other knights. For your gift, ask a gift of me.
LANCELOT: Only give me leave to ride out again, to do what I am most able to do, and happiest doing.
GUENEVERE: He must stay for the feasting days of our wedding, and tell his deeds himself.
ARTHUR: I grant you your wish if you grant Lady Guenevere hers.
