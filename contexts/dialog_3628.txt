R.L.: Laz, I know about that girl. Good number of this town's sinners got my ear, you know. Oh, Laz. She's had a mess of crabs and them STD's. What'chu thinking?
LAZARUS: I haven't laid a hand. On my life, R.L., my wick is dry on this.
R.L.: You say she was beat on. You call the sheriff on that?
LAZARUS: Put yo'self in my shoes. Say you out here, alone, with a beaten, half naked, white woman loves to fuck. I been toe to toe with the law in this town for no more than being black and nearby.
