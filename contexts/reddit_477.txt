(ADVICE) My Parents Don’t Care
hi. I just needed to get this off my back. Any advice would be great. ps im not great at expressing my feelings with words. 

I feel so trapped in my own house. It’s to the point where I just feel sad all the time. My parents work everyday (seriously, they have no day off) until 8 pm. Don’t get me wrong, I know they work hard to provide for me. But because they’re gone all day, I’m left home all alone. There’s often nothing to eat at home and because I’m the only one home, I’m expected to take care of all the housework. I know I sound like a brat, but I’m only 16... I wish I didn’t have to cook my own food and take care of the house. Instead of their daughter, I feel like their maid. The worst part? My parents are overly strict and protective (ironic, I know). I’m not allowed to leave the house at all. Sometimes I want to hang out with friends, like a normal teen for God’s sake. But I’m not supposed to leave the house alone and no one can drive me. If I could, I would get a job, take summer classes, or do something to get out of this damn house. But I cant and I don’t know what to do. This isn’t something new either- it’s been going on since I was 13. I just don’t know what to do.
