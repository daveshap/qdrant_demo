Staffing agency ghosting?
Had a recruiter call me. Saw my resume, set up a phone interview, called again for the interview, told me about existing jobs I might be a fit for, discussed following up with some more after I expressed keen interest, then...nothing. Won't answer his phone, my texts, or my emails. any thoughts?
