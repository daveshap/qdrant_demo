CYNTHIA: I wish I could tell everybody that Ann's a lousy lay. Beautiful, popular, Ann Bishop Millaney.
JOHN: Could be risky.
CYNTHIA: Well, maybe I could just start a rumor, then.
JOHN: No, I mean doing it at my house.
CYNTHIA: Afraid of getting caught?
JOHN: Maybe.
CYNTHIA: You should be. Can I meet this friend of yours?
JOHN: Cynthia, I don't think you want to, I mean, you should see the way he dresses. I really think he's in a bad way.
CYNTHIA: I'm intrigued.
JOHN: You're intrigued?
CYNTHIA: Sure. Maybe he's the man I'm looking for. Then I won't have to fuck worried husbands all the time.
