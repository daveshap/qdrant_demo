CROCKETT: Yeah?
JOSÉ YERO: Hey, Captain Kirk. I think maybe I have second thoughts.
CROCKETT: You got something to say, José, let's hear it.
JOSÉ YERO: I confess I have succumbed to my weaknesses. An inability to see another's point of view. I've discussed it with professionals. Even with one of your friends. She's here now...
CROCKETT: What friend?
JOSÉ YERO: Mrs. Rico. But don't worry. She is safe. To insure that, I am keeping her close to me. It's always good to keep people your friends care about close to you.
CROCKETT: Proof of life. How do I know Mrs. Rico's alive?
JOSÉ YERO: 'Cause she will tell you.
ISABELLA: That sonofabitch!
TUBBS: You set this up!
ISABELLA: Of course! That is why I placed myself here, with you, knowing Yero would pull this crap.
