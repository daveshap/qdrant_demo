At what point does it become inappropriate to chat your advisor down?
Edit: title should say CHASE not CHAT

It’s my job to graduate and I’m willing to do what it takes but I have to wonder what is appropriate in an advisor/advisee relationship.

Constantly saying they’ll follow up with me on stuff but unless I reached out first, it never happened. 

Rarely respond to emails. Not in the office usually and when they are, it’s a dash to their office for their time if you want ANYTHING. Common theme for all their interactions with students. I’m not sure what’s going on. 

Again, I know it’s my responsibility to get out and graduate, but I have to wonder what’s normal and what’s not. 

I graduate soon with my master’s and I did a lot of work with help from my co-advisor, independently, and with support from a great lab, but it’s just been a weird time. 

I got what I wanted (mostly) out of this experience, but the professional relationships part of it was difficult to navigate and I will need to continue understand how to deal with others when I go into industry.
