Feeling uncomfortable & unsure what to do
Hi all,

I wrote a post in this sub a few weeks ago regarding job burnout - unfortunately I’m still at this job, but am actively applying to jobs every single day! In the meantime, I wanted to ask about something specific I’ve been dealing with for maybe 1.5 months. 

I was given a responsibility at work that I think is inherently wrong. Without explaining it too much, we’re deducting pay for a service currently closed during quarantine, and there are about 50 employees who will not be getting a credit or refund for these deductions, and they’ll be leaving the firm in June (this was decided by upper management). I’ve been basically tasked to tell these people “well, sorry, not our problem!” (That’s more or less a quote from my boss). 

I feel like I’m helping rob people, and it’s honestly making me sick. I have a long history of depression & anxiety which I can keep in check for the most part, but since these decisions were made- I am constantly nervous and on the brink of tears (or just crying), I’ve bitten all my nails off, and I’m having a really difficult time keeping up with my other responsibilities. I’m really not trying to be dramatic about any of this, I’ve just never felt so strongly that something I was doing was wrong. Another issue is that I have a hard time separating professional from personal, so when people vent to me about this, it just completely drains me. 

Am I allowed to tell management that I’m not comfortable with this responsibility, or will this reflect badly on me? (I’m trying to leave the firm anyway so I’m not sure that it’s worth it). Has anyone ever been in a similar situation?
