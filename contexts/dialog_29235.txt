HARRY: I came all the way from Detroit by bus going to Oakland. The bus stopped in Los Angeles. I had to get off and take a rest. I'll catch the last bus leaving at midnight. I'm just too tired to go on.
GIDEON: Why didn't you catch a plane?
HARRY: My feet have never been on anything that wasn't directly attached to the ground.
GIDEON: Stay until you feel better? I would like to hear all the news.
HARRY: I'm worn out but won't you feel like you are taking in a stranger?
SUZIE: Stranger my foot, it was my grandmother who helped you into this world.
HARRY: Well, I don't want to put you out.
GIDEON: Man, put your boxes down and stay as long as you like. We have empty rooms since the boys got their own families and moved out.
HARRY: Well if you're sure, I won't be a bother. Oh, I don't sleep on no spring mattress. I always make myself a pallet on the floor.
