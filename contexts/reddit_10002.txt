Can universities fix grades?
I'm a psychology student at a university near London. I heard that our lecturers just moved everyone's grades down last year after the exams. Can they just do that? It seems really unfair. It was multiple choice so even though we got the answers right they reduced the marks. its not like moving grade boundaries at GCSE or A-level. There are a lot of people who will graduate with lower grades now. Does this happen anywhere else and what can we do about it?
