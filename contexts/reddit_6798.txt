"The Recruiting Professionals".. anyone heard of them?
Based in Virginia.. address is to an office space building right off a main access road. Domain hosted by GoDaddy and every time you call their main number I get a recording to leave a voicemail... no receptionist.  Email appears to be hosted by Yahoo.

Reason I'm asking? $150k work from home for an IT Generalist with overseas travel.

Sounds too good to be true.

So here I am hoping others here have heard of this place.
