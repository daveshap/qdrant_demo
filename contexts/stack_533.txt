Bootable recovery partition or DVD Does anyone have a recent resource on creating a recovery partition or a recovery DVD?  I have Ubuntu 16.04 with xfce4 installed and running just fine.Three choices:1)  A bootable recovery partition, and then clone the entire drive (empty primary partition, swap, and recovery partition) to DVD as a second recovery medium (preferred).2)  Clone to self booting, self installing DVD (second choice).3)  Customer preseeding an Ubuntu Desktop install DVD (also acceptable but it is quite intricate to get right).A base install (operating and uncompressed) is taking up 7 gb, so compresssion is a consideration if the entire recovery is to fit on a single DVD.Mondo sounded like a possibility, but I can't get it to install and run on Ubuntu 16.04.  Development within mondo has not progressed on mindi-busybox, and mindi-busybox is a required dependency.
