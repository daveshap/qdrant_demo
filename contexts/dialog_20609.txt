DANNY: Fun today. Like old times.
RAFE: Danny, what the hell are you trying to do out there?
DANNY: What do you mean? I'm just doing what we've always done.
RAFE: No. You're trying to beat me.
DANNY: We've always tried to beat each other.
RAFE: Bullshit. We've played with each other, pushed each other. This is different. Like you want to prove that you're better than me. Who's that for -- Evelyn?
DANNY: Maybe just trying to measure up.
RAFE: What's between you and her is between you and her. But here's what's between you and me. Everybody has a hero, Danny. And you're mine.
