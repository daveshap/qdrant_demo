DORIS: Who's going to buy me a beer?
FRANKIE: What's the matter, Doris? Business bad?
DORIS: It sure is.
FRANKIE: Everybody givin' it away free, huh?
DORIS: You gonna buy me a beer, Frankie?
FRANKIE: See Duff. He's the money man.
DORIS: What d'you say, Duff?
DUFF: Give her a beer.
DORIS: Thanks, Duff. You' a nice guy. Not like Frankie.
FRANKIE: You know, Doris - you'd make some guy a swell wife.
DORIS: You think so, Frankie?
FRANKIE: Hell, you got steady work.
