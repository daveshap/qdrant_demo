Path to a distant star Suppose we have a space ship that can go fast enough (0.9c) and we have plenty of time, and we want to travel to a star on the other side of the galaxy. How do you plot a path to navigate to that star? Given the distances and the number of stars in the way, which all affect the shape of the gravitational field, is it even possible to compute a reasonable path to follow? Do we know the trajectories and masses of the stars along the way with enough precision? Should we shoot outside the galactic plane and come back closer to it again as we get closer to the star? Stay in the galactic plane? Something else?
