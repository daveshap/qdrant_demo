KIRSTY: I'm here.
STEVE: I thought we'd lost you.
KIRSTY: I'm coming! Sleep well.
KIRSTY: You know I do know the way home.
STEVE: It's late.
KIRSTY: Not that late.
STEVE: Please. I want to see you home. All right?
KIRSTY: All right. No. That's nice.
STEVE: If there's a train.
KIRSTY: What do we do if there isn't?
STEVE: We walk.
STEVE: Why don't you stay at Larry's house? There's plenty of room.
KIRSTY: Yeah, there's room. And there's Julia.
STEVE: I see.
KIRSTY: She's so damn... English.
STEVE: Meaning what?
KIRSTY: Oh, I don't know. Up-tight. Frigid.
STEVE: I beg your pardon?
KIRSTY: There ya go. I beg your pardon?
STEVE: We're not all frigid.
KIRSTY: Oh no?
STEVE: Oh no.
KIRSTY: It's not what I heard.
STEVE: Well you've just been talking to the wrong people.
