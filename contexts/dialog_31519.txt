ELEKTRA: I met you at my father’s funeral.
BOND: Yes.
ELEKTRA: I haven’t been able to recall a single moment of that day...until now.
BOND: Funerals aren’t exactly memorable.
ELEKTRA: God no. All those horrible loved ones and relatives. I don’t want to talk to those people. I just want to...talk to my father. I loved him. I’m not sure he knew that.
BOND: Is that why you want to finish the pipeline?
ELEKTRA: Partially, yes.
