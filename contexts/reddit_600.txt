Fustrated about College and Mom
So I recently found a college that I want to go to. It’s a semi big university, 21,000 students. I told my mom about it then we decided I might potential go there. Now that I got my fafsa I realize that I don’t have enough money to go and neither does my mom and I don’t want loans. So I apply for a community college and I told my mom that I wanted to go there first both because we don’t have the money and it’ll give me a steady start to college. She continues to try and push the idea of going to the big university on me and gets upset because she really wants me to experience the big university life. I really dislike having to argue about my future with her when she’s not gonna be stuck with the bill later on. What should I do?
