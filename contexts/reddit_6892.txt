Question about lay-off
So I am a 20 year old college student. I have been working at this place since September, but they laid me, and many others, off on New Years Eve. He explained that if I email him my schedule for February he will put me in. 

For this, I obliged, I sent in my schedule, via email. After about 20 or so days, I send him a text, asking if I still had a position there because school was starting soon.  

I then sent him it again via text and he said: “let me see what I can do”

After this, I waited a while, 5 days to be exact, but I ask him again, if he was able to put me in. But no response. 

Is this normal? Am I overreacting? Should I believe him if he said I would be hired back February? Sorry for all the questions, I’m new to the job scene, and I’m just confused :/
