ADAM: It's Ukrainian. Her grandparents immigrated here.
CALVIN: Uh-huh.
ADAM: Dad, I don't know how to tell you this. And I was going to wait a while, but I think...Dad,there was no bomb. A plane crashed into our backyard. I looked it up in old newspapers.
CALVIN: You're sure?
ADAM: Positive. The Soviet Union collapsed without a shot being fired. The Cold War is over.
CALVIN: That's what everybody believes?
ADAM: Yes, sir. It's true.
CALVIN: What? Did the politburo just one day say - We give up?""
ADAM: Yes. That's kind of how it was.
CALVIN: Uh-huh.
CALVIN: My gosh, those Commies are brilliant! You've got to hand it to 'em! No
ADAM: Uh, I think they have.
CALVIN: Hah!!! Those cagey rascals! Those sly dissemblers! Those, uh... They've finally pulled the wool over everybody's eyes!
