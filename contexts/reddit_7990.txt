Managing finances as PhD?
I’m a first year PhD student and am wondering how others manage their finances: I’m currently on a 1 year fellowship and waiting to hear back about 3 year fellowships that would start up next year. Regardless, my advisor has grants so I’ll be funded for the foreseeable future, which means income security is pretty high compared to being an at-will employee at some company. This makes me feel like I can take on a little more risk with my growing savings, namely moving some of my money out of HYSA now that I have 6+ months expenses as an emergency fund. Also not planning for anything big - live in a metro area so no car, no plans on putting money down on a house, etc. 

My monthly expenses are only about 60% of income, so I feel like my monthly residual will start growing quickly. Given there’s no 401k program for grad students (at least where I’m at), how are you managing your savings? IRA, standard investing, or safer asset classes?
