I know this isn't a typical post, but I want to write a book about "poverty teeth" and I want to hear your stories.
I grew up in a family that was large and poor. I have always had dental problems. I distinctly remember two of my older brothers and I going to the dentist  when we got onto Medicaid and getting multiple teeth pulled. We were better off than two of my younger brothers, who had to be put under for their intensive dental work. Having gone our entire early childhood with no dental care, we had a life of dental misery ahead of us. Whenever I tell my more well-off peers about my stories from the dentist, I always get a response along the lines of "why didn't you brush your teeth?" 

Dental care isn't accessible for millions of people living in poverty, and only poor people know the shame that comes with crooked, missing, and gapped teeth in a world where neat ivory rows are the norm. 

I want to hear stories from people who have bad teeth as a result of poverty; I want to hear how it has affected you and anything else you want me to know.

EDIT: Thank you all so much for sharing your stories with me! ANd thank you for my first silver! 

I will put the stories shared with me on a Google Docs link, which can be found here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ErWgDJEOz8UX2SaEPf4aFqlCC5DP_qcT_BGeZQa_VFQ/edit?usp=sharing      

If you would like me to include your name, age, or location, just leave a comment on the Google Docs sheet with any information you want to share. 

Because I am a busy student, I will try to work on this book daily, but it will be a slow process. It will take a while to put all the stories on the Google Docs sheet, but I will try to include them all, so long as the stories are about having bad teeth as a direct result of poverty. 

I will be editing submitted stories to correct any mistakes and to add clarity, but I will do my best to preserve the original voice.
