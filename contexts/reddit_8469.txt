President-elect Trump has struck a deal with Carrier to keep jobs in Indiana. What are the wider implications?
/r/NeutralPolitics has been getting a lot of submissions on this topic, but none of them quite meet our standards, so the mod team has decided to cobble together the questions and sources from all of them into one post. Thanks to everyone who contributed.

Donald Trump spent much of his presidential campaign pledging to keep manufacturing companies from moving jobs overseas. On Tuesday, air conditioning company [Carrier said it had reached a deal with President-elect Trump to keep nearly 1,000 jobs in Indiana.](http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/nation/2016/11/29/carrier-trump/94638336/) The state of Indiana plans to [give economic incentives to Carrier](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/29/business/trump-to-announce-carrier-plant-will-keep-jobs-in-us.html) as part of the deal to stay. Though there are obvious benefits of keeping these jobs in the US, Senator and former presidential candidate Bernie Sanders [says it's a bad deal for taxpayers.](http://thehill.com/homenews/news/308242-sanders-carrier-took-trump-hostage-and-won)

So, some questions:

* What are the pros and cons of the deal itself?
* What are the wider implications of the deal? 
* Is there evidence to indicate that a President who takes an interest in individual deals like this can have a substantial effect across the economy? 
* Is it unusual for a President to insert himself into individual negotiations like this, and if so, does it set a precedent?
* Can the working class people who Trump targeted in his campaign see a substantial benefit from moves like this?
* What kinds of wider effects do deals like this — tax incentives in exchange for not moving jobs offshore — have on wealth inequality?
* Do companies like Carrier, who are direct beneficiaries of a tax incentive, end up with a competitive advantage over other players in the marketplace, and if so, what are the pros and cons of that?
