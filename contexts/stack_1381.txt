General questions about the telephone line a.k.a \"last mile\" Before the digital data gets conveyed over the \"last mile\it passes a modem, which converts this digital data into audio signals (Which is often called analog) (but the binary system still is there, as audio signals represent 1 and 0 (high tone = 1, low tone = 0) as the \"last mile\" is only able to convey this type of signal (namly audio).But isn't the telephone line as copper as an ethernet cable (if you know what I mean)? Why can this telephone line only convey audio signals? And how is the audio-signal conveyed over this copper cable? (I don't think it will convey my voice when I speak into the cable...).Are many audio signals transmitted over the \"last mile\so does it even matter if they interfere (As I think that when using DSL over 40000 audio signals must be transmitted in one second (40kHz frequency sometimes))!?
