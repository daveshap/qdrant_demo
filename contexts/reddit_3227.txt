Which Career is Less Stressful: Accounting or Programming?
I've been deciding between Accounting and Programming. I just want to make sure I make the right choice based on my personality type. I'm a high anxiety person so its important that I choose a career I can handle well.

I've done some very basic skimming of both fields on the internet just to get a taste of what it's like. I don't know Jack, so I could be completely wrong about what I'm about to say below

Accounting looks good to me because it appears to have a stable workflow. It seems like kind of job that you can just sit down and get to right away. And it seems like a job that is more mechanical and streamlined (less mentally taxing and less likely to make your head blow up). A job that you can digest easily in small incremental portions. 

Programming looks interesting but I heard its for those problem-solver type people. The kind who like puzzles and brain games. That's not me at all. I never had an interest in puzzles as a kid and I still don't. It also seems like the kind of job where you frequently run into problems and lose your head over it. So that's a negative side for me. 

On the other hand, the idea of creating something from scratch (a program) is fascinating to me. I am a creative person at heart. Just not sure if I'll enjoy the act of programming because I never really did it personally so I don't know what it's like.

Which of these careers is less stressful? And which of them has a more flexible working schedule? I'm considering private accounting btw (which I hear is less stressful than public accounting)

A flexible work schedule is important to me. I've heard that a lot of programmers work on their laptops and choose to work whenever and wherever as long as they finish the work by the deadline. Is this true?
