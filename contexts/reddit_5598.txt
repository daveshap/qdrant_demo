I need your help appealing Education Requirement for the job post Community Outreach Organizer
 

Hello,

Long time lurker seeking your help reddit.

a bit of background: psych major and poli sci minor from recognized university in CA.

I am applying for the post of Community Outreach Organizer for local gov (CA) but I was disqualified because of the education requirement being:

**"Graduation from a recognized college or university with a bachelorâ€™s degree in public relations, community relations, urban planning, business administration, public administration, or a related field"**

There is an appeal process available. I really want to appeal this because its one of the few job posts I've come across where I have enough work experience to be competitive in the interview portion of the application process. Can you guys help me argue that my psych BA is related to these majors?

Please let me know if you guys need a bit more info.
