JEFFERSON: Ax?
NOSEY: A pet idea--you know--pension bill-- save the buffalo--you've got *one* notion you think would be good for this country, haven't you?
JEFFERSON: Well--I have got *one* idea--
VOICES: Ah! That's more like it! What?
JEFFERSON: Well--for a couple of years now--I-- I've thought it would be a wonderful thing to have a National Boys' Camp out in our State--
VOICES: A camp! Well!
JEFFERSON: You see--if we could take the poor kids off the streets--out of cities-- a few months in the summer--learn something about Nature and American ideals--
NOSEY: Marvelous! And what would this camp set the Government back?
JEFFERSON: Oh--nothing--nothing. My idea is-- for the Government to lend us the money--and the boys'll pay it back-- sending in a penny or a nickel--no more than a dime--no, gosh--the Government's got enough on its hands without--
NOSEY: Great! The Government's putting dough in too many places *now*!
