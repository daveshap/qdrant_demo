anxiety mistaken for rudeness and disregard for respect. depression mistaken for laziness and not willing to put effort forward.
I'm 17. I'm gonna kill myself this year sometime this year. sometime soon. I didn't have a childhood yet I'm being thrown into adulthood as if I can handle it. I was never stable never since a child never since age 6 or 7. never fucking stable. I'm sorry I'm this way I didn't want to be. but fuck you for making this all about you. fuck you for putting it all on me as if I'm not affected by suicide attempt. by my mother practically abandoning me. by being left alone for years as a kid. as being bullied by my own family. by years of isolation of just wanting to straight up murder myself because that's so stupid. fuck everyone. fuck you. fuck family. fuck "friends". fuck my boyfriend. go die and fuck yourself

edit: I thought this would go washed under new. maybe a few upvotes and a comment. but not this. thank you for making me feel heard for once.
