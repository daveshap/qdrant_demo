I don't really have any friends I can truly rely on, and my best friend ditched me
Ever since my best friend got a girlfriend 3 years ago, I feel like I've been kind of tossed to the side and have been a side thought for a long time. My fiance is still there for me which is nice but we work on opposite schedules so I don't get to spend very much time with him and the rest of the time I'm pretty much by myself. 

My friends don't really reach out to me and I'm always the one having to reach out to them, I'm not really that close with my family, and I just really wish I had a person. 

My best friend was my person, and now his girlfriend doesn't like me and so we don't hangout often and he doesn't really reach out or call unless I do. On the TV shows you see these people who have these friends that are there for them, and I just don't have that anymore. I miss having a person. 

One example is when I bought my house me and my fiance did everything ourselves. My best friend came and helped for 2 hours which is fine but no one else offered or cared to help. Now this friends moving and our entire "friend" group  is gonna go help and I feel jealous. He still has those friends and those relationships and I've got far less. He's unaffected by this and him and his girlfriend get to go off and be happy as shit and I'm left for shit. 


I'm not normally depressed or sad and I'm very happy with most of my life and I do have some very special and important people that I am lucky to have, but this has just been at the back of my mind for so long. Thank you to anyone who reads this, you're a kind soul for taking the time to.
