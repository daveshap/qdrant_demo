Joining committees: is it worth it?
I got an email yesterday saying that I had been nominated to stand for election as the representative for my region on the student concerns subcommittee for the national association in my country/field. I'm supposed to respond ASAP and let them know if I accept the nomination (after which there will be a vote).

I know that a certain amount of service is expected from academics. But I have no idea if getting involved in this kind of thing as a grad student has any benefits, or if it's just going to be a poor use of precious time in exchange for a mostly worthless line on my CV. 

Anyone have any wisdom on this they'd care to share? Thanks!
