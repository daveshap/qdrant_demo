Making colours proportional to value field, continuously and not discretely as with graduated colours classification in ArcGIS Desktop? Under symbology in ArcGIS, there's the option to graduate colours given a value field, a colour ramp, and some classification.How do you make the colour graduation continuous (rather than discrete as with the classification)? Either continuous along an existing colour ramp or by being able to specify colour values directly through functions for each RGB/HSB channel?It seems like pretty basic functionality to be able to provide more than the maximum of 32 levels of classification, so I hope I'm just missing something. Maybe I'm not using the right terminology because I haven't found any results by searching yet.
