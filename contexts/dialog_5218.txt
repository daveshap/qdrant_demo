RICK: And then?
ILSA: It wasn't long after we were married that Victor went back to Czechoslovakia. They needed him in Prague, but there the Gestapo were waiting for him. Just a two-line item in the paper: Victor Laszlo apprehended. Sent to concentration camp." I was frantic. For months I tried to get word. Then it came. He was dead
RICK: Why weren't you honest with me? Why did you keep your marriage a secret?
ILSA: Oh, it wasn't my secret, Richard. Victor wanted it that way. Not even our closest friends knew about our marriage. That was his way of protecting me. I knew so much about his work, and if the Gestapo found out I was his wife it would be dangerous for me and for those working with me.
RICK: When did you first find out he was alive?
ILSA: Just before you and I were to leave Paris together. A friend came and told me that Victor was alive. They were hiding him in a freight car on the outskirts of Paris. He was sick, he needed me. I wanted to tell you, but I, I didn't care. I knew, I knew you wouldn't have left Paris, and the Gestapo would have caught you. So I... well, well, you know the rest.
RICK: Huh. But it's still a story without an ending. What about now?
ILSA: Now? I don't know. I know that I'll never have the strength to leave you again.
RICK: And Laszlo?
ILSA: Oh, you'll help him now, Richard, won't you? You'll see that he gets out? Then he'll have his work, all that he's been living for.
RICK: All except one. He won't have you.
ILSA: I can't fight it anymore. I ran away from you once. I can't do it again. Oh, I don't know what's right any longer. You'll have to think for both of us, for all of us.
RICK: All right, I will. Here's looking at you, kid.
ILSA: I wish I didn't love you so much.
