Should I round up my GPA?
Iâ€™m graduating with a gpa of 3.18. A lot of jobs say their minimum GPA for new hires is 3.2 . I was talking with my father about this and he says I should just list as 3.2 because no one looks at the hundredth digit anyway, but this feels sketchy to me. What do you all think?
