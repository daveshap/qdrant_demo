What the heck is going on in this electrical box? (Photo below). Is this safe?Just a homeowner who has changed his fair share of fixtures and outlets... but have never come across this. Two whites leading to the fixture white.A red wire leading to the fixture blackAnd two black wires in the back that I don\u2019t know where they\u2019re going?And bare wire (assuming neutral) just coiled up in there.And there is burning/charring around the electrical box and inside the old fixture.Is this configuration safe?
