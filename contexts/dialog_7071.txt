MAX: Playing hooky again?
THEO: Feel like the dog's dinner.
MAX: Probably a touch of what's going around.
THEO: I know what I got, Max. They put me back on that drug they're giving the other vets. Only the guy does those cable hacks says the stuff's no good.
MAX: Don't believe everything you hear on TV.
THEO: What if he's on the level?
MAX: Here's the dealio on Eyes Only. He's probably some wack rich dude sitting around in a trick-ass apartment, bored stupid. So he gets off on scarin' the poop outta folks like you-- I gotta go.
THEO: Tell everybody hey.
MAX: You can tell 'em yourself tomorrow.
