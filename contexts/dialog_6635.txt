DANIEL: Turn on the flashlight.
JULIEN: I'm trying. It doesn't work.
JULIEN: Do they come with batteries?
DANIEL: You didn't buy batteries?
JULIEN: I thought they came with batteries.
DANIEL: I can't believe you didn't check.
JULIEN: I bought everything you put on the list. Gloves. Pen knives. Flashlight. Batteries were not on the list.
DANIEL: Why should I have to put it on the list? It's like saying to buy a car with tires.
