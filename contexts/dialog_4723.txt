PRINCESS: I am the Princess of Wales.
WALLACE: Wife of Edward, the king's son?
PRINCESS: I come as the king's servant, and with his authority.
WALLACE: It's battle I want, not talk.
PRINCESS: But now that I am here, will you speak with a woman?
PRINCESS: I understand that you have recently been given the rank of knight.
WALLACE: I have been given nothing. God makes men what they are.
PRINCESS: Did God make you the sacker of peaceful cities? The executioner of the king's nephew, my husband's own cousin?
WALLACE: York was the staging point for every invasion of my country. And that royal cousin hanged a hundred Scots, even women and children, from the city walls.
PRINCESS: That is not possible.
