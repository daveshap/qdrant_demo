It’s frustrating when my friends sit in their big suburban houses just after their trip to Europe and agree with me that being broke sucks, when I’m not making rent, driving a 15 year old car and selling My nicer things to pay the bills.
I called out a different friend on it when they made a similar comment (swap Europe for Mexico) and they defended their position. I didn’t feel like opening bank statements to elaborate. It made me realize it’s not an argument worth having any more. Also makes me not want to hang out with them any more. 

This probably isn’t going to get any upvotes. I just wanted to vent.

Edit for clarity: when I said they agree, I meant that they’re relating their situation to mine. I think everyone can agree that being broke sucks.
