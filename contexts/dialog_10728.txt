REBECCA: You're just jealous.
ENID: Yeah, right... Believe me, at this point I'm over the fact that every single guy likes you better than me!
REBECCA: Face it, you hate every single boy on the face of the earth!
ENID: That's not true, I just hate all these obnoxious, extroverted, pseudo- bohemian losers! Sometimes I think I act so weird because I'm crazy from sexual frustration.
REBECCA: Haven't you heard about the miracle of masturbation?
ENID: ...maybe we should be lesbos...
REBECCA: Get away from me!
ROBERTA: Who is this, Enid?
ENID: It's supposed to be Don Knotts.
ROBERTA: And what was your reason for choosing him as your subject?
ENID: I dunno... I just like Don Knotts.
ROBERTA: I see... interesting...
ROBERTA: What do we have here, Margaret?
MARGARET: It's a tampon in a teacup...
ROBERTA: I can see that... now what can you tell us about it? First of all, what kind of sculpture is this?
MARGARET: It's a found object"... that's when an artist takes an ordinary object and places it in an artistic context and thus it becomes art."
ROBERTA: Very good. Now, what can you tell us about it in regard to your artistic intent?
MARGARET: I guess I see the teacup as a symbol for womanhood, because of tea parties in the olden days, but instead of tea I was trying to kind of confront people with this... like...
ROBERTA: This shocking image of repressed femininity!
MARGARET: Right, exactly!
ROBERTA: I think it's really a wonderful piece, Margaret!
