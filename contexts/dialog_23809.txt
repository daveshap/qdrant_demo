JACK: Please just try to be your normal humorous self, okay? Like who you were before the tailspin. Do you remember that guy? People love that guy. And don't forget -- your novel is coming out in the fall.
MILES: Oh yeah? How exciting. What's it called?
JACK: Do not sabotage me. If you want to be a lightweight, that's your call. But do not sabotage me.
MILES: Aye-aye, captain.
JACK: And if they want to drink Merlot, we're drinking Merlot.
MILES: If anyone orders Merlot, I'm leaving. I am not drinking any fucking Merlot!
JACK: Okay, okay. Relax, Miles, Jesus. No Merlot. Did you bring your Xanax?
JACK: And don't drink too much. I don't want you going to the dark side or passing out. Do you hear me? No going to the dark side.
MILES: Okay! Fuck!
