KANSAS: Grandma and Grandpa sent you pictures of a neighbor girl. They didn't want you to break out and come kidnap me.
MRS. HILL: Thank G-d. I was starting to think I'd killed the wrong man.
KANSAS: You shouldn't smoke so many of those.
MRS. HILL: I know, but it keeps down the size of my can.
KANSAS: They could kill you.
MRS. HILL: So could half the women in here. And I'd rather go out with a nice can... So watcha here for? To say how much you hate me or how much your grandparents hate me...
KANSAS: I don't hate you. I need your help.
MRS. HILL: My what?
KANSAS: Your help.
MRS. HILL: Now how the hell can I help you?
KANSAS: Okay, you can't tell anybody.
MRS. HILL: Gee, I'll sit out this afternoon's coffee talk. Whaddya want?
KANSAS: My best friend got pregnant.
MRS. HILL: Before you? Whoo-hoo!
KANSAS: I know - that's what I said too. Anyway, we want to help her get some money for the baby by robbing a bank.
MRS. HILL: Well, shit-fire, Kansas, that's the sweetest goddamn thing ever...
KANSAS: I know, but we can't quite figure out how to, y'know, do it.
MRS. HILL: So you need my help? Oh my G-d, this is like asking me for help with your homework. Hey, Mink, c'mere!
MRS. HILL: Kansas, I want you to meet someone special.
KANSAS: Oh, Jesus Christ, Mom! Like my life ain't a great big pile-of-shit 'cause you're in here? Now I have to add, P.S. My mom's a dyke" too?"
MRS. HILL: What?! Hush up, you mouthy little shit!
KANSAS: Hey, don't mouthy shit" me - I'm outta here."
MRS. HILL: Wait, Petunia. Mommy's a little amped up - didn't get her yard time this morning. Mink ain't my bitch. She's a specialist... in banks.
