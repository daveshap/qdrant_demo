CLARICE: All his victims are women... His obsession is women, he lives to hunt women. But not one women is hunting him - except me. I can walk in a woman's room and know three times as much about her as a man would. I have to go to Belvedere.
CRAWFORD: You heard them. I don't have that authority anymore.
CLARICE: You do until six p.m.
CRAWFORD: Ohio is cold ground. Picked over, ten months ago. Our people worked it, so did the locals.
CLARICE: But not from this angle. Not thinking he knew her. You've got to send me!
CRAWFORD: I'm Bureau for 28 years, Starling. I won't disobey orders, not even now.
CLARICE: But I just became a private citizen. I can go anywhere I want to.
CRAWFORD: With ID and a gun...? Impersonating a federal agent is a felony.
CLARICE: He's going to kill her, Mr. Crawford. This morning, or maybe at noon, but today, and Belvedere's our last chance. I'm flying there, right now, unless you stop me. You want my ID? Here - take it...
