Induction in transformer coil relationship to magnetic field lines in core From my understanding is the process of induction described by a magnetic field line which approaches a wire perpendicular and creating an local electric field in it which can be detected which measuring electrical voltage at the ends of the wire.What bothers me is this process in a secondary transfer coil. The magnetic field lines are inside the core and do not cut the coil wire at the surface of the core.Does one need to differentiate between induction by magentic field lines cutting a wire perpendicular and the sum of magentic field lines inside a loop of wire? How exactly does induction happen in the last case compared to the first case?
