Open the object attribute dialog for a selected feature with the Python QGIS API I want to open the attribute dialog programmatically for a selected feature. I need to achieve the same effect as if the user clicks on the \"object identify\" action ( CTRL + SHIFT + I).I searched the QGIS API docs for QGIS 3.2 but I was unable to find a solution.I found the classes QgsAttributeFormInterface and QgsMapToolIdentifyFeature, but I was not able to use them in a useful way.I also tried to trigger the action from the toolbar, but I guess I need some kind of click event with x,y coordinates for this to work.Does anyone know if you can open the attribute dialog from a plugin programmatically?Andi
