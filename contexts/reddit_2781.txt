Which path after high school?
I'm 17 and a junior in high school right now. My grades are amazing, I have a 4.5 gpa and have played a sport all 3 years so far. I'm in the top 15 of my class but I am confused as to what I want to do in the future. Throughout my whole life, I've been told by many people to go to college to get a degree and make lots of money. Growing up, many people told me that I am smart and have a lot of potential. But I feel guilty because I want to do something that is hands on, such as being a firefighter, mechanic, electrician, etc. I asked my counselor that I'm thinking about a trade school and all she said was that it was pointless since I've already taken so many AP classes. My family is really poor, and if we had the money, I probably would become a doctor or a lawyer. But I've heard so many stories about people drowning in debt and not finding jobs after they graduate. My financial situation is bad enough already, which is why I'm seriously considering going to a trade school instead of college. I'm honestly scared that I'm making the wrong choice. I don't care about making 6 figures, I just want to make enough so I can help my family and make sure my little sisters can go to college without worrying too much about money. So, should I go to a trade school after high school or continue my studies so I go to college?
