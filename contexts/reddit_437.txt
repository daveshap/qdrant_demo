My boyfriends best friend touched me during a sleepover
My boyfriend and I have been together about a year and I’ve been friends with his friend group since then, I’ve never had a problem with anyone and we all got along very good. Which meant we have a lot of sleepovers, we had a sleepover at my house a week ago and then I got woken up during my sleep to find my boyfriends best friend basically on top and him fingering him I pushed him off and went and slept in the bathroom the whole time. I haven’t told my boyfriend yet because I don’t know how he would react, and now I’m terrified to hangout with his friends especially his best friend and I don’t know what to do because I keep canceling plans on them which led to my boyfriend becoming very annoyed. And to add on as of yesterday his best friend who touched me is now dating his younger sister. 

Update: 

I just told my boyfriend who told his sister and now his sister and mom are sending me threatening text messages and calling me a liar and they are non stop calling me and leaving very rude and harsh text messages and voicemails and then the whole friend group turned on me even this girl named Sam who I was friends with and told the day after it happened

I have no clue what to do anymore I hate my body. I hate myself I can’t even have sex anymore because of how disgusting I feel all my anxiety and panic attacks came back that’s been gone for years and now I just destroyed his whole family and friend group and I also lost all my friends and no one believes me and I didn’t even want to tell my boyfriend because I felt this would happened and now I’m just so scared and sad
