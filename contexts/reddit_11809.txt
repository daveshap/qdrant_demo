Nothing I want more than just to start over.
Like ALL over. My disposition has done an absolute 180 degree turn and I really just wish I could do it over again. Basically all I see my future consisting of is me doing something I don't give a shit about and paying off student loans because I fucked around in high school. Not only am I dreading the future but I don't really have anything to hold on to. I still haven't found my "calling" or reason to keep pushing. I see all my peers have their passions, but I've always just coasted though everything. My parents seem pretty dead set on me just going to college and getting a normal job. Fuck that. I have daily thoughts of just leaving everything behind and going out and trying to do everything on my own. My parents have never wronged me though and pretty much given me everything I needed to be "successful". I'm not about to walk out on that. This might seem normal/petty but it's just kind off concerning to me that I have daily thoughts dreading the future and just wanting to start over/walk out.
