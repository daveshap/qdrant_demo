SQL Server on CentOS using CAL licensing I have been running a PoC for a large data science workload with SQL Server on CentOS.I recently discovered that SQL is using only 20 cores of a 56-core server.  I understand that this is because it is operating under the Server+CAL licensing mode, as shown by this entry in the SQL log:<blockquote>  SQL Server detected 2 sockets with 28 cores per socket and 28 logical processors per socket, 56 total logical processors; using 20 logical processors based on SQL Server licensing. This is an informational message; no user action is required.</blockquote>I know I can change Edition using mssql-conf, but is it possible to change the licensing mode so that I can address all CPU sockets?
