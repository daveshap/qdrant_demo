Anyone else get paranoid that everyone hates them?
I have social anxiety and sometimes I get an overwhelming feeling that everyone around me hates me. I walk through work and I feel like everyone is staring and I did something wrong but I don't know what. I start to panic and I just want to quit and go hide. Anybody else ever feel this way?

Edit: thank you to everyone who commented. It’s nice to feel like you’re not alone in this world. I’ve often heard a dismissive “that’s irrational. Stop it”  when discussing this feeling and it’s so refreshing to see others relating and giving great advice. Thanks again everyone :) have a great day!
