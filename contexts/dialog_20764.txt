ANDREW: The law says people with disabilities cannot be terminated, so long as they can perform the duties required by their position...
JOE: Okay, okay... They discover you have this horrible, disgusting, terminal illness, and they panic, for any number of perfectly valid reasons. They're frightened for themselves, their families... Maybe it's the homo angle. Maybe they don't want to rub elbows with someone who's just popped out of the closet with a terminal case of acne. And how do they explain your status to the client for Chrissake?
ANDREW: Joe, from the day I arrived to the day they fired me, I performed consistently, thoroughly and with absolute excellence. And if they hadn't fired me, that's what I'd be doing today.
JOE: Okay... They want you out. It's against the law to fire you for having AIDS, so they make you look like a fuck up. Which leads us to the mysterious, lost file.
ANDREW: They sabotaged me.
JOE: I knew you were going to say that. I don't buy it, and I don't see a case.
ANDREW: Look. I know I have a case. If you don't want to take it for personal reasons...
JOE: Correct. I don't.
ANDREW: Thanks for your time.
JOE: Beckett? I'm sorry about... what's happened to you. It's a fucking kick in the head.
ANDREW: Don't send flowers, Joe. I'm not dead yet.
