Inclement weather at destination airport during layover in a foreign country As many of you North Americans know, there is an upcoming winter storm hitting the Northeast soon (at time of writing). I am about to take a flight from Shanghai, China back to New Jersey, with a layover in Narita, Japan.If I arrive in Narita and the second leg of my flight is delayed (possibly to the following day), will I be permitted to exit the airport? What would be the standard procedure for the airline? (In addition, what would happen if I had to stay overnight?)Additional information:I'm a Chinese citizen, leaving from Pudong International Airport, stopping at Narita, and finally arriving at Newark International. The first leg (Shanghai-Narita) is operated by All Nippon Airways, and the second leg (Narita-Newark) is operated by United Airlines. I am also a minor (under 18), but not considered as an unaccompanied minor, at least by United.Thanks in advance!
