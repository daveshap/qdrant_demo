ELAINE: Benjamin, when you came up here, what did you think was going to happen between us?
BEN: Elaine -- right now I don't feel like talking much. I'm sorry about everything but I think I'll just do this now.
ELAINE: Can I just sit here while you're packing?
BEN: If you want.
ELAINE: What are you looking for?
BEN: My belt.
ELAINE: Don't you have it on?
BEN: No. I have two. The other one is the one I'm looking for. What's this? It's from my grandmother.
ELAINE: The marble?
BEN: The belt I'm looking for was from my grandmother.
ELAINE: Oh.
ELAINE: What are you going to do now?
BEN: I don't know.
ELAINE: Are you going home?
BEN: No.
ELAINE: Well -- where are you going?
