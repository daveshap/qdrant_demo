JOEL: I remember you turned around. Your face was dark and your hair was backlit -- I could see a halo of frizz -- you asked me if things were okay between Naomi and me.
CARRIE: I did. You said, things were fine.
JOEL: I remember.
CARRIE: This is the night you met Clementine, Joel. I remember watching you walk down the beach with her and I thought, oh shit.
JOEL: Yeah, you told me that later.
CARRIE: I told you that later.
CARRIE: Who was the girl you walked off with?
JOEL: No one.
