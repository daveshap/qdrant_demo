I kinda need help
Hi, I'm wondering if how I'm feeling is ok. I'm 16 and male, there is this guy I like who is 14/15 he is in 8th grade. I've liked him since him and his sister moved where I live and that was almost 3 years ago. I've known that I've liked him, but never really though anything of it. He doesn't show any signs of being gay/bi. Recently in the past few months, I've started feeling even more attracted to him, and it's not just "yeah I like him he's cute" it's a really strong feeling, when I see him I get kinda sad knowing I'm probably never gonna get close to him, and idk what to do, I've thought about telling him how I feel but I can't bring myself to do it, bc idk if that's the right thing to do. I want him to know but I also don't want to risk out friendship. I'm stuck and need help.
