I feel like I'm just waiting for time to pass.
I'm not happy. I do things I enjoy doing, but I'm not happy. I'm lonely, I'm shy, and feel like I make terrible, boring conversation. I have friends, and generally people like me, but I don't think I'm that great of a person. I sometimes have verbal diarrhea. I can't make new friends and if I do it relies heavily on the other person to approach me for the friendship. I'm lazy and have no idea what to do for a career. I find life too hard to deal with and I lack confidence to put myself out there. My girlfriend of almost 9 years left me for a multitude of reasons for which I don't blame her. I was happy while with her but I think she was just a bandaid for my larger problems and now that she is gone I can't stand myself. I don't know how anyone could put up with me really. I mean, yeah I get along with people and I can be funny but once it's a real friendship or relationship, I feel so boring and miserable, so unable to relate with. I think my ex feels like I was boring and a waste of time, unable to grow up and be a man. I'm broke and almost 30. I'm really just a loser who is worse off than when he graduated high school. I haven't even gone to college. I think I just wasn't made for this world. I can't compete. I think I shouldn't have children so that I don't pass on my terrible genes. I don't want to kill myself or hurt my family or friends but if I didn't wake up tomorrow I wouldn't complain.
