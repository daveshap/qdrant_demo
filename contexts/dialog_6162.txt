HAL: You and Frank get the tents, thermal clothing, and medical supplies together.
JESSIE: Who's going with you?
HAL: You're looking at him.
JESSIE: Where's the rest of the team?
HAL: Bob and Rick are in Denver. I gotta get up there as fast as possible. Frank, get me a load of flares.
JESSIE: Thank God you didn't leave. We just got a Mayday. Seven climbers stranded off Comb Bluff. The weather's pouring in fast and Hal's gone up alone.
GABE: Hal knows what he's doing.
JESSIE: If he gets up there and the weather gets as bad as it can, they'll never make it down. He needs someone who has emergency medical training and knows every handhold on these peaks.
GABE: He doesn't want my help.
JESSIE: That's not the issue here, those people are. He can't do it alone.
GABE: He can handle it.
JESSIE: What if he can't?
GABE: I haven't climbed in months--you lose the feel.
JESSIE: You mean the nerve.
JESSIE: I know you don't want to be responsible for anybody's life anymore, but walk away and you are responsible. Please Gabe, he went up the west ridge. If you go up the south face, you can catch him, no problem--
GABE: Can't do it.
JESSIE: Can't do it? I don't believe this. Don't you feel anything?
GABE: I only came back for you.
