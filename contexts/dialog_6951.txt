FRIDA: That I'm a doormat of course. The shrink makes more notes.
SHRINK: Oh, I see... interesting theory.
JENNIFER: Okay, just one more stop and you'll be all set. Victoria's Secret.
FRIDA: What do I need overpriced fancy underwear for? Shouldn't a guy have already decided that he likes me before he sees me in lingerie?
JENNIFER: It's not about him seeing you in it. It's how you feel. You'll feel sexy in lingerie and it'll show. It's an inner thing.
FRIDA: I don't know.
JENNIFER: There's a sale. It's such a nice place -- classical music, relaxing atmosphere. You deserve to pamper yourself. Come on, it can't hurt.
