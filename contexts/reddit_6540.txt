Experience of Glassdoor reviews?
I posted this to get the community's opinions on Glassdoor - esp. since I've had an inconsistent experience of using the site! How do you use Glassdoor?

My take: Take the reviews on Glassdoor with a grain of salt - the reviews you see are either fake reviews (as in employees coerced or enticed to give positive reviews) or people who are so pissed (either because they were fired or because they had a bad manager) that they leave a negative review which may not represent the organization as a whole.

My advice: Talk to people working in the organization, if possible. Use additional sources of information about the company like:

* Newspaper articles
* Google reviews/google searches
* Reports on the company's website like financial reports

My experience

* There was an MLM company that invited me to a job interview and it turns out that the company tends to invite unemployed people and sell them credit cards! Google reviews saved me on that one.
* A friend tried to recruit me into WFG - an MLM - [and the reviews on Glassdoor are great](https://www.glassdoor.ca/Reviews/World-Financial-Group-Reviews-E148185.htm)!
* I worked at an organization that sucked but the reviews were great because employees who had been in the organization for a long time were encouraged to write reviews. Unfortunately, new and younger employees had a very different experience of the company.
* I got a job offer from a great organization, but I was hesitant because of some negative reviews. Luckily a friend pointed out that the number of negative was less, so I should be careful on how I evaluate the company.
