JOHANA: What are they for?
NOVELLI: They're paramedics. They wait at 180 feet.
JOHANA: If there was a problem, they could do something right?
NOVELLI: Of course, that's what they're for.
JOHANA: ... And those?
NOVELLI: Those are the divers who go down 300 to 330 feet. They dive with a Helium-oxygen mixture. At that depth, compressed air is too dangerous because it contains carbon dioxide.
JOHANA: What's that little air bottle on the machine?
NOVELLI: That isn't for the divers actually. It's for the balloon. It blows up and pulls the diver up like an elevator. Without it, with the pressure at the bottom, the diver would just stay pinned to the sea bed.
JOHANA: But doesn't Jacques dive without anything?
NOVELLI: Yes... It's magic.
