Is there a pair of words for distinguishing US Federal Government branches from the other components of the Federal Government? I'm seeking a pair of words to distinguish between the two entities below, words that make it clear I'm talking about components of government, words that the reader understands as referring to government without needing to be told explicitly.For example, tire and rim: you don't need me to tell you I'm talking about parts of a wheel, and you understand that the two words refer to specific parts. Or roof and foundation: it's clear I'm talking about two well-defined components of a house; top-o-gov and bottom-o-gov; head-o-chicken and body-o-floppin'.The two entities in particular:The \"top\" part of the US Federal Government, that is, the three branches Executive, Legislative, Judicial.All the rest of the bureaucracy and machinery such as the Post Office, social programs, embassies, Bureau of Land Management, federal police forces, everything run by the Federal Government but not in the \"top\" part.
