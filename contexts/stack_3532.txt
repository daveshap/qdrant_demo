How to obfuscate SSH tunnel Mac? I am looking to test a DPI (deep packet inspector). I currently have it set up to block SSH connections (which it does successfully).I have learned that DPI can be bypassed by obfuscating/encrypting the initial handshake (I think, feel free to correct).  By doing this, the DPI is not able to tell that the traffic is SSH and does not block it. How can achieve this with macOS? I have complete control over both the server and the client.
