SONNY: My kids ... Kimmy and Jimmy.
SYLVIA: They're beautiful ...
SONNY: I'll never see them again, Mister Mulvaney.
MULVANEY: They look like good kids.
SONNY: They're like any others but they're special to me. You got kids? You told me; you got two.
MULVANEY: Special to me, too.
SONNY: You like me?
MULVANEY: Sure - we like you.
SONNY: No you don't.
MULVANEY: You seem like a likable enough guy. It's hard to judge.
SONNY: Hey, Sal ... How you doin'?
SAL: Okay.
SONNY: You know, I don't know him very well - but he's not gay ... and he's not going back to prison ... One time when he was in prison, they gang-banged him; 13 years old and eight guys gave it to him ... So Sal isn't goin' back to prison, no way.
MULVANEY: I'm sorry.
SONNY: You know ... I like you people ... I really do.
MULVANEY: We like you, too.
SONNY: You know - I had a job once. I used to work in a bank. I had been training ... I used to have a boss ... Mr. Don Frio ... he wore a toupee ... I wonder if you'd hire me if I came in here and asked you for a job ...
MULVANEY: Would I hire you?
SONNY: Yeah.
MULVANEY: Why not?
SONNY: I don't think so.
