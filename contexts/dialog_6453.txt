ELLIE: There is no direct evidence, no.
KITZ: And current theory holds that to sustain the sort of wormholes you're talking about, even for a fraction of a second, would require more energy than our sun produces in a year, is that correct?
ELLIE: I don't have the figures in front of me, but yes, that sounds about right.
KITZ: In fact, by all the laws of physics we know what you claim to have experienced is simply impossible.
ELLIE: By our standards... yes.
CHAIRMAN: ... And this is how the extraterrestrial presented himself to you? As your father?
ELLIE: Yes, sir.
CHAIRMAN: He died... ... in 1972.
ELLIE: Yes, sir.
CHAIRMAN: Dr. Arroway, do you think it's possible you had some kind of... delusional episode.
ELLIE: Is it possible...?
CHAIRMAN: All the elements are there. A woman, orphaned young, under a great deal of stress. The failure of a project she's staked her self-worth and very sense of identity on -- induces a fantasy of reuniting with her 'father in heaven' as it were. Is it possible?
KITZ: Please answer the question, Doctor.
ELLIE: Is it possible. Yes. But --
KITZ: Thank you, Doctor. Now --
ELLIE: -- but I don't believe it to be the truth.
CHAIRMAN: You don't believe it to be... tell me something, Doctor. Why do you think they would go to all this trouble... bring you tens of thousands of light years, and then send you home without a shred of proof? Sort of bad form, wouldn't you say? What was their intent?
ELLIE: I don't know. Ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology.
