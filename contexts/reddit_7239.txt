improperly trained and no one will believe me.
so to avoid a rant i'll just give the details.

two weeks ago i was hired on as a shipper at a local warehouse, there are a number of them around so they sent me off to get trained in another building a city or two over.

From the very start i was given very little explanation on how to do anything and whenever i asked a question i was given an exasperated sigh and retold the same thing i was just told which doesn't explain the task only how to complete it, not what im doing, just push these buttons, input this number, press enter.

i figured it was a bad day but it went on like this for 2 weeks with my trainer steadily growing more and more angry with me but not telling me anything, I had no idea what i was doing to make them upset so in the end i basically just shut down and waited to be told what to do, I did have a moment or two of extreme frustration bordering on anger because I had no idea what i was doing and ever question was answered with something like "that's just what we do"

the building i was training at no longer wants me to show up for the last two days of training, so im going to the building im supposed to be working in, the problem is word of my negativity and attitude have spread so my reputation is already sullied in my actual work environment.

I've talked with 3 different managers and expressed that I really don't know what i know and what i don't know, that my training isn't going well, and in effect i was told to shut up and do what im told, the man training me eventually tried to get me sent back to my building but was unsuccessful at first.

Im pretty sure im going to get fired tomorrow over something i can no longer fix, and issues no one will care to listen too.

we also have a whatsapp group to ask questions to each other and get information on whats coming up, I was removed from that group. I feel like i've already been fired.
