Found out my girlfriend does drugs and I can't stop thinking about it
A few disclaimers/apologies:
-I currently working for another 7 hours and I'm working on this throughout my shift between rushes. I'm sorry if my thoughts seem to jump around.
-The drugs aren't anything of the major ones ex: heroine and cocaine

Ok here's a few placeholder names and ages. Coworker (cw) is in his late 20's and girlfriend (gf) and I are both 17

So this is what's bothering me. About a month ago I found out that my girlfriend used marijuana recreationally (no it is no legal in my state). J found out one day because after our shift we were headed to get wings with our coworker. I was slow clocking out because I felt the need to help out a little after my shift. Eventually I walked out back and saw the two smoking together. My first thought was "Oh yikes I didn't know she smoked". When cw saw me he asked if I was ready to go and we headed out. Before we sat down cw turn to my gf and said "I wonder if it was a bad idea to smoke weed, cause now I'm about to drink a beer. Hope it isn't dangerous". At this point I am just shocked. The rest of the night was me pretending to space out while my gf, cw, and CW's friend were eating. The next day I talked things through with my gf and told her that she can keep doing what's she's doing as long as she keeps herself safe (like not endangering her body or getting into trouble with the law). I also told her drugs were a touchy subject with me and to not talk about it in front of me.

Fast forward about a month to today. I'm in for a 10 hour shift with cw. While working I hear him mutter to himself, and I asked him what was on his mind. He turns to me and told me that he was wondering if he should start his mushroom plot (no not normal mushrooms) for my gf before or after he leaves for his vacation.

Now I get if you're scoffing at this and saying that I'm overreacting over something so small and I totally understand that. I was raised by a very strict dad and a paranoid schizophrenic mom. I hate to blame my mom but I think my habit of over thinking/worrying about every small thing comes from her. Ever since I was a kid, I was taught to be the type of person to always follow rules and to stay in line. This definitely made me a more reserved person who is afraid of taking risks no matter how small. Because of these things my brain is always running wild and it has been for the past 5 hours now. I'm just scared that she might get hurt while on drugs or even move on to stronger and more dangerous drugs.

I know you guys are going to say, so here's somethings I can answer now:

Why don't you ask your parents for advice?
- My parents wouldn't allow me to continue seeing her if they found out about this

Try to talk her into quitting?
- She is a free spirit who hates limitations/restrictions being put on what she can or cannot do. Also it is her life not my life and I shouldn't interfere too much.

Why don't you talk to her family about it?
- Her only family (mom and grandma) actually do these types of drugs as well

Any advice is greatly appreciated and even if you don't have any, thank you for reading
