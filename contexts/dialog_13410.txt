COACHMAN: Times gone, Fort Holland was a fort...now, no longer. The Holland's are a most old family, miss. They brought the colored people to the island-- the colored folks and Ti-Misery.
BETSY: Ti-Misery? What's that?
COACHMAN: A man, miss -- an old man who lives in the garden at Fort Holland - with arrows stuck in him and a sorrowful, weeping look on his black face.
BETSY: Alive?
COACHMAN: No, miss. He's just as he was in the beginning -- on the front part of an enormous boat.
BETSY: You mean a figurehead.
COACHMAN: If you say, miss. And the enormous boat brought the long-ago Fathers and the long-ago Mothers of us all - chained down to the deep side floor.
BETSY: But they came to a beautiful place, didn't they?
COACHMAN: If you say, miss. If you say.
