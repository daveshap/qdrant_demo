ROB: Alison's.
ALISON'S MOM: Really.
ROB: Long time ago. I was just thinking about her. I was her first boyfriend.
ROB: Rob. Rob Gordon. Circa junior high...
ALISON'S MOM: I hate to quibble with you Rob, but she married her first boyfriend. Kevin Bannister.
ROB: You gotta be kidding me.
ALISON'S MOM: That's right. Kevin. She's Mrs. Kevin Bannister. She lives in Australia.
ROB: Really? Married Kevin? Her junior high sweetheart... What chance would I have had against that? None, no chance. That's just fate.
ALISON'S MOM: I beg your pardon?
ROB: Technically, I'm number one. I went out with her a week before Kevin did. Her first boyfriend. Me.
