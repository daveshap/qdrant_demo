Curious
So, I am planning on applying to a Master of Education in Higher Ed. Admin this fall, but I came across this [Student Affairs in Higher Education Certificate](http://www.ecu.edu/cs-educ/idp/aded/SA_Cert.cfm) during my research.  

I was curious what everyone thought about the Certificate and if it could be useful in anyway.
