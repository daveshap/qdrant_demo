SHIRLEY: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.
CRISWELL: I have promised both The Wolf Man and The Mummy a reward. It could be that <b>you</b> are that reward.
SHIRLEY: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.
CRISWELL: You need not worry...Not just now, anyway.
BOB: Leave her alone, you fiend!
CRISWELL: Fiend is it! You will not be so fortunate. Your existence will cease within moments. No one wishes to see a man dance... And you, my dear, will entertain for centuries to come.
BOB: If I could get my hands on you...
CRISWELL: ..Oh, You could do nothing! I can save you much pain.
BOB: Leave her alone, I tell you!
CRISWELL: I do not joke in my proposal.
PRINCESS OF DARKNESS: She is to be <b>mine!</b> It is so spoken!
CRISWELL: The Princess of Darkness would have you for her own to join us through extreme pain. Yet I am inclined for one as lovely as you, to be more lenient. I have but to touch you with my finger, and it would mean the end of you, all over, quickly and painlessly...
SHIRLEY: No. No! No!
CRISWELL: I repulse you? Very well. It seems you have chosen your own fate. Live with it! I should say <b>die</b> with it!
BOB: I've got the ropes loose now. I've got my hands free. Be careful--Don't change your expression too much. They must not catch on.
SHIRLEY: What can we do against them?
BOB: I don't know, yet. We'll just have to watch our chance. When it comes I'll know what to do--I hope I'll know what to do.
SHIRLEY: I still don't know what ever made me go steady with a crackpot writer like you.
BOB: All right. Put it on heavy.
SHIRLEY: My old boyfriend Tommy would never have gotten me in a mess like this. At least <i>he's</i> got brains.
BOB: <i>Him!</i> I'll bet he sleeps with all the lights on.
SHIRLEY: Maybe so.
THE MUMMY: I could make her another Cleopatra...
THE WOLF MAN: Ahh hahahhnnn hahnnn!
THE MUMMY: Without the snake, of course.
PRINCESS OF DARKNESS: Well?
CRISWELL: Ahh, she will be yours.
PRINCESS OF DARKNESS: When!?
CRISWELL: At your discretion...But first, I desire more entertainment.
PRINCESS OF DARKNESS: The moon is almost gone!
CRISWELL: Ahh, there is yet time.
PRINCESS OF DARKNESS: At the first sight of the morning's rays' light...
CRISWELL: I know the laws of the night. I state there is still time for yet another.
PRINCESS OF DARKNESS: I would have time for my own pleasures!
CRISWELL: Your own pleasure comes only after mine, when I desire it. I am the Sole Ruler of the Dark World. There is no one to challenge my authority here. My word is the law--all powerful. <b>No one</b> is to challenge that authority, <b>no one!</b>. Is that understood? It is my command.
PRINCESS OF DARKNESS: I understand, Master
CRISWELL: Then see that it does not happen again, in the penalty of Everlasting Despair. Now are there others?
PRINCESS OF DARKNESS: There are others.
CRISWELL: Well then let us proceed.
