Feedback questions after rejection when you work alongside the interviewers
Hello all,

I recently applied for a position at the company I currently work for, it was for a position that is directly related to the degree I am working on. The experience from the position would have impacted the time frame for professional licensing in the career field. I was recently notified that I did not get the position, but was told that I was the runner up and really impressed those I was interviewed by. Since I work in the department already and somewhat close to those I was interviewed by, I am finding it difficult to come to terms with the decision that was made, I suppose it is the norm of rejection. I am taking it a bit personal since once this pandemic is over and we return to the office I will see those I was interviewed by again. It’ll be a while before that happens and I think I’ll be fine and over it by then. For now I come to ask for some advice from you all, I have asked for interview feedback and was asked to set up a meeting by one of the interviewers, scheduled a couple weeks from now. What questions should I be asking? I am going to stay professional no matter what. I just don’t really know what I should be asking. All I can think of is “why not me?” I’ve gotten good feedback from the other interviewers through e-mail and from superiors who were privy to some direct information so I really don’t know what to expect. Thank you all for your time.
