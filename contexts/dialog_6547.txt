HELEN: What happened to you?!
M.J.: Ruben's dead. So stupid, a cop thing, a crazy kid and a buncha dumb mistakes... I'm sorry... because you and he...
M.J.: I just thought it was so -- unprofessional. Of you both!
HELEN: He felt sorry for me. It was so nice to flirt. He was a darling man.
M.J.: A man? I thought he was a boy. This last Christmas was the happiest Christmas I had in the last ten years... you know why? It was the first Christmas in six years I was not in love. Son of a bitch <u>married men</u>! Who cares about marriage, the bed just gets crowded and noisy?!
HELEN: You're exhausted. Let me get you a brandy.
M.J.: Where's the john? Let me clean up this mess, and get back to work.
HELEN: Who's the married man?
M.J.: What does it matter? This guy, you checked your course records, who signed up?
HELEN: The University computer is down for maintenance, but I've been going through my own notes...
M.J.: Look. There's the order: you wrote it: DeSalvo, Bianchi & Buono, Berkowitz and Dahmer. It's going to be Dahmer next. Which means he'll kill a man.
HELEN: Yes. Dahmer! And after that...
M.J.: Bundy. That's the last one in your speech...
HELEN: Maybe you should...
M.J.: I'm working on it! It's what I do. Quinn...Halloran. I'll wait. Where's Andy, can we get some coffee in here?
HELEN: Out. Where does he go? Nowhere. What does he do? Nothing.
