HEJIRA: For a time.
FOLEY: Meaning?
HEJIRA: Meaning time came, I left.
FOLEY: You busted out?
HEJIRA: I prefer to call it an exodus from an undesirable place.
FOLEY: And how long was it before they caught up with you?
HEJIRA: That time?
FOLEY: There were others.
HEJIRA: Yeah. That was the ninth.
FOLEY: The <u>ninth</u>?
HEJIRA: Ten, you count the prison hospital in Ohio I walked away from.
FOLEY: You must be some kinda walker, Henry.
HEJIRA: Hejira.
FOLEY: And so now you're off to Glades.
HEJIRA: Apparently, yeah. I was supposed to leave last night with the lady marshal, but for some reason she wanted to wait.
FOLEY: She did, huh.
HEJIRA: Cheaper I guess, take us both down in one van.
FOLEY: Yeah, could be. Or maybe she thought we'd have a lot to talk about.
HEJIRA: Like what?
FOLEY: I don't know. It's a long way down to Florida.
