When you first started working, how bad were you at making professional phone calls?
I'm at an internship rn and I feel like I'm so bad and awkward on the phone. It improved since I started, but I still feel like I stutter over my words, I don't sound legit, maybe I try too hard to sound "customer service-y", and people don't really take me seriously. Sometimes there's like awkward pauses on the phone where the other person is trying to process what I just said because I probably said something dumb. I always say that I'm an intern at xxx organization so I don't represent my org badly. Just wondering if other people here were like that when they first started and if it improved with practice?
