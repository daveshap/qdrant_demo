JANET: I know, I know, it's just...
BERT: Looks like 'Rest Home' for this marriage.
BERT: Do you watch 'Dentonvale,' Janet?
JANET: I've caught it once or twice.
BERT: Of course! D.T.V.'s most popular Hospital series featuring those perennial favorites, Cosmo and Nation McKinley. Neuro-specialists par excellence ...if you'll pardon my French. I recommend you send Brad to them for treatment!
JANET: I know he's boring but... Neuro-specialists! That sounds pretty drastic.
BERT: It's no use pussyfooting around, Janet -- we have to cut quick and deep.
OLIVER: McKinley?...McKinley?
BETTY: Bert brought them over from Europe. They had a very popular series together. It's still rerun in a lot of countries. You must have seen them in 'Dentonvale?'
