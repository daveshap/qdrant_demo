NARCISSUS: How much money is involved?
PROXIMO: A great deal. They designed and build Tiger's chariot...
NARCISSUS: They want to dump Tiger and have me endorse their damned chariot, right? They don't waste time...
PROXIMO: I can really rape them on this! Can I at least tell them you'll think about it?
NARCISSUS: No. Tell them I'll do it. But I want more posters all over Rome.
PROXIMO: Fantastic! Wonderful! But posters are very expensive.
NARCISSUS: Then get a large cash advance.
PROXIMO: Right, right... But they'll have to bring in a lawyer. I don't want to get sued over this.
NARCISSUS: Before they leave, get gold.
PROXIMO: Right, right, what am I thinking of?
NARCISSUS: I want another interview with Cos. Tell him to bring plenty of ink.
PROXIMO: I'll do it! Sure as there's shit in the Tiber we're all going to die, but for you -- anything!
