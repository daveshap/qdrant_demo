CARRUTHERS: Patrick? Is that you?
BATEMAN: No, Luis. It's not me. You're mistaken.
CARRUTHERS: This is Gwendolyn Ichiban. This is my very good friend Patrick Bateman. Where are you going? We're going to Nell's. Gwendolyn's father's buying it. Where did you get your overnight bag?
BATEMAN: Commes des Garcon.
CARRUTHERS: Call me please, Patrick.
BATEMAN: Jesus lives, Luis.
