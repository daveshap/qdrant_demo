MRS. ACKERMAN: That's like your car, Beverly,
MOM: I'm not that bad a driver. Look at her hair! Turn it off, honey.
CHIP: I can't believe Mr. Stubbins is dead.
MISTY: You said you hated him.
CHIP: Well... he was an asshole... but he didn't deserve to die!
DAD: I can't stop thinking about that poor teacher. Goodnight, honey. Don't read late, we've got a big day with the birds tomorrow.
MOM: I've identified every little birdie we're going to watch tomorrow on the Eastern Shore.
DAD: Goodnight, honey.
MOM: Don't I get a kiss?
DAD: I just thought with all the sadness... you wouldn't want...
MOM: We have to concentrate on life, Eugene.
DAD: It's fine with me, Beverly. You want to, honey? You think the kids are asleep?
MOM: We can be real quiet...
DAD: I love that you're my wife.
MOM: You're not bad yourself, coo-coo bird...
DAD: You bring me such peace...
MOM: Oohhhh, Eugene!
DAD: Shhhh..
MOM: Oooohhhh.
DAD: Don't wake the kids...
MOM: Ooohhhh!
MOM: Oooohhh! Yeah! Yeah!
DAD: You're hot tonight, honey... but be quiet! Shhhh! The kids!
MOM: Yeah! Oohhhh! Get it!
DAD: Ooh, honey, I'm ready! Now! Now!
MOM: Oohhhhh! Yeah! Yeah!
MOM: There's Dede! He's my favorite chickadee! He's here every morning for breakfast.
DAD: Well, honey, chickadees breed in Alaska, you know. No wonder Dede's hungry. It's a long trip all the way to Baltimore.
