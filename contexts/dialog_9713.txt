BOBBY: Four or five years.
CARL: No, the last time was three years ago.
TITA: Oh no, it's been much more than that.
CARL: Away from the piano, Tita, you have no sense of time at all.
TITA: I don't think that's true.
CARL: It is true.
TITA: Besides being very rude.
CATHERINE: What have you been doing since then?
BOBBY: What have I been doing? Different things, different jobs, here and there. Nothing that interesting.
CATHERINE: And you no longer play at all?
CARL: You know, just after I came back off tour with the Betenthaller Quartet, Dad, myself and Herbert had a summit conference about you...
TITA: Oh, my, a summit conference." I wonder where I was
CARL: I don't know where you were, penis envy.
TITA: I hope I didn't hear that.
CARL: At any rate, Dad wanted to hire a private detective to ferret you out, and I said, What for?" Whatever the hell he's doing
BOBBY: Well, I really appreciate it, Carl.
TITA: I don't think you should infer Daddy was wrong in front of him...
