DEAN: Is Eric in school?
STACY: Yes.
DEAN: Has anyone been by? Police? FBI?
STACY: Just reporters.
DEAN: I wish you'd gone to your parents like I asked you.
STACY: This is my house. Nobody's kicking me out of my house. I picked those drapes.
DEAN: I don't think anybody wants the drapes, Stacy, I think the drapes are okay.
STACY: What happened to your head?
DEAN: I was in a car chase and a small explosion. Now listen to me: The NSA is behind this. They think that guy I told you about, Daniel Zavitz, they think Zavitz gave me a tape or computer chip of some kind that could be damaging to them. So they're doing all these things <u>electronically</u>. The bank records, the surveillance. They're the ones who broke into the house. Now I know there's no reason to believe me. But I love you. And I love our son. So just believe me anyway. Please.
STACY: Does that hurt?
DEAN: Well...yeah.
STACY: Good.
DEAN: Stacy--
STACY: I <u>told</u> you they could do this. I <u>told</u> you they had this kind of capability and that with this anti- terrorism it would be just another--
DEAN: Stacy...Stacy...maybe now isn't the best time for the I-Told-You-So speech.
STACY: I'm sorry I didn't believe you.
DEAN: That's okay.
STACY: I opened the present you got me from Harrison's.
DEAN: You opened the thing?
STACY: The lingerie.
DEAN: That was for Christmas.
STACY: I was missing you.
DEAN: You're as bad as Eric. I've got an entire family of people who root through--
DEAN: ...who root through...uh...presents, and...
STACY: What is it?
DEAN: Oh Christ.
