Is there a word for confusing words like 'everyday' with phrases like 'every day'? I see people confusing words that are compounded from two words with a phrase made from those words. This is easy to do, as they look and sound very similar:For example:\"everyday\an adjective, with \"every day\which I assume is a prepositional (or adverbial?) phrase.\"giveaway\a noun, with \"give away\a phrase containing a verb. \"awhile\an adverb, with \"a while\a noun phrase.However, the word \"everyday\" has a defined meaning in Standard English, and it's different to \"every day\". My question assumes that the inevitable language change that leads to each pair merging hasn't happened yet.Phenomena like this sometimes have specific names (like 'metathesis'). Is there a technical name given to this mixup?
