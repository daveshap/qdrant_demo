I want to be happy again... I hate myself
I have no friend and my anxiety it tearing me down. I fail everyone around me including myself and all I want to do is feel like I’m making someone proud. My fiancée doesn’t understand my anxiety which make me feel like a burden. Why does life suck so much. All I want is to feel loved. Show me you love me.
