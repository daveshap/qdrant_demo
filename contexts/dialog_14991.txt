VANESSA: Juno! God, you startled me. What are you doing here? What's wrong?
JUNO: Nothing...
VANESSA: Then what's going on?
JUNO: I went to the doctor today.
VANESSA: Is the baby okay?
JUNO: Sure. It's the right size and everything. I even saw its phalanges today! Check this...
VANESSA: What...
JUNO: This is the baby. Your baby.
VANESSA: Oh my God...
JUNO: Doesn't it look like it's waving? It's kind of like it's saying Hi
VANESSA: Yeah. Yeah, it kind of does.
MARK: Juno was nice enough to bring this by for us.
JUNO: I came over as soon as I got that cold ultrasound goo off my pelvis. My stepmom verbally abused the ultrasound tech so we were escorted off the premises.
