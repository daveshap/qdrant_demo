I no longer want to die.
The past few months have been difficult but I think I’ve finally come out of this depression. The day I was going to end it all, my boyfriend come over and took me for a long walk. I finally realized I have something to fight for. I know there will still be hard times in the future but right now I’m living in the present. Thank you to everyone in this subreddit for helping me. Keep fighting.
Edit: Wow, I didn't expect this to get so much attention. I'm glad to help. <3
