Small victory: I managed to control a suicidal anxiety attack before it got too serious.
Every day with anxiety and depression is a challenge, but it feels nice to count up these little wins. I've been having a lot of bad days for the past month or so and I've been trying to figure out how to cope. Happiness/contentment does seem far away and even impossible at times, and in the case today, it led to nearly catastrophic panic attack today.

I'll admit, it's been a long while since I've had suicidal ideations, which makes the whole experience a fair bit sour for me, but I least I can take solace in the fact that I recognized the signs before things got out of control. Being able to understand, "Hey, listen, you're having a panic attack," and enact a plan of action feels kind of liberating. I was able to stop the attack, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't still under high anxiety right now.
