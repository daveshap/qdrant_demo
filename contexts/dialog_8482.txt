LAURA: I'm embarrassed.
ERIN: That's okay. I understand.
LAURA: It's just -- the pain. It's only getting worse. I can't be a good wife. I can't be a good mother.
ERIN: I'm real sorry, Laura.
LAURA: Know what I always thought I wanted outta life, Erin? A Jaguar.
ERIN: Jaguar's a darn pretty car.
LAURA: I thought if I could spend that kinda money on a car, it'd mean everything else was fine. I don't even know how much they cost.
ERIN: A lot. But you hang in there, maybe you'll get one.
