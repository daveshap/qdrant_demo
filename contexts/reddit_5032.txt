Do you think I’m going to hear from them back?
Hello Fellow Redditor,

      I’m about to graduate with an A.A in chemistry and I applied to be a lab technician at a fish farm. I got emailed the basic questions. “Why do you want to work here?”, “What are your strengths?”, “What do you expect for compensation?” I answered all these questions and this was on June 15 and now it’s the 19th. This job is perfect. It’s what I love. It’s super close to home. It’s in the field I want to be in. Do you think I’ll hear from them back? Everyday I wake up expecting an email and I get nothing. I don’t get a phone call either. I have applied to other jobs but this one is my favorite. Should I just stop worrying about it? Has anyone gone through a similar situation?

Sincerely,

Thatchemistrystudent
