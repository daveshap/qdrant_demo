HITCHHIKER: Thanks for picking me up.
TED: No prob, I could use the company. I've been on the road going on fifteen hours straight.
HITCHHIKER: I know how you feel -- I been standing in the same spot for the last five hours. You know it's against the law to pick up a hitchhiker in this state.
TED: That must make it tough.
HITCHHIKER: Sucks. So what's up? You some kind of salesman or something?
TED: Nah. I'm... I'm nothing.
HITCHHIKER: Oh. Well I am.
TED: Hm?
HITCHHIKER: A salesman -- that's what I am. I mean, I'm gonna be anyway. I'm starting my own company -- video sales -- just as soon as I get enough seed money.
TED: 'That right? Good for you.
HITCHHIKER: Yeah, you wouldn't believe my idea -- it's a home run. You ever hear of Eight-Minute Abs?
TED: The exercise tape? Sure, I've seen it on T.V.
HITCHHIKER: Two million copies it sold last year. Two million, man. But not next year -- my idea's gonna blow them outta the water. Get this: Seven-Minute Abs.
TED: I see where you're going.
HITCHHIKER: Think about it. You walk into a video store and you see Eight-Minute Abs and right next to it you see Seven- Minute Abs -- which one you gonna spring for?
TED: I'd go with the seven.
HITCHHIKER: Bingo. Especially since we guarantee you'll get every bit as good a work- out.
TED: How do you guarantee that?
HITCHHIKER: Well it's the company motto: 'If you ain't happy we'll send you the extra minute.'
TED: Huh. That sounds great. Unless someone else comes out with Six-Minute Abs.
