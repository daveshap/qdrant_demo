Got off the NYU waitlist DURING my AP Lit Exam and I am literally still shaking
I had just started my essay and an email popped up on my screen from NYU, I knew exactly what it was. I spent around 5 minutes just reading the admissions letter and sitting there in disbelief. Because of that I submitted my exam with, and I’m not exaggerating, 2 seconds left on the clock. I don’t even know how I finished because my mind was so distracted. 

NYU was my dream school from the very start of my admissions process, but I’m gonna have to think long and hard on whether I will attend. I would be paying full price and I’m not sure I want to do that to my family.
