LA HIRE: Jeanne, let me introduce the king's half brother, the dogged Lord Dunois.
JEANNE: Then, Lord Dunois, show me the way to the other side of the river...
DUNOIS: Wait, wait...
JEANNE: For what?
DUNOIS: Because... because -- I mean -- the English have a broad sense of humor, but... I mean, you don't understand... to them you're a witch, working for the devil. What makes you think they'll listen to you?
JEANNE: Because if they don't, I'll raise such a war-cry against them that they will remember us forever!
DUNOIS: Well. I'd love to see that, but after taking counsel with my captains, I felt it would be better to first bring the food into the city, then wait till Alencon arrives with reinforcements before doing anything.
JEANNE: You may have been with your counsel, but I've been with mine, and I'm telling you, God's counsel is wiser than yours, and he's telling me to speak to the English -- now!
DUNOIS: Fine -- go now if you want, but not with me! You may have a duty to God but I have a duty to my people, and my people are starving! So right now I'm going to take the food back to the city, and if you can please calm down, and let me accompany you to Orleans, it will be my honor to welcome you.
LA HIRE: Jesus Christ... the goddamn English will pay for this!
JEANNE: They will -- and so will you if you go on swearing like that.
