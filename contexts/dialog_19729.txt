NIXON: What are you saying? What are you talking about?
PAT: I want a divorce.
NIXON: My God -- divorce? What about the girls?
PAT: The girls will grow up. They only know you from television anyway.
NIXON: It would ruin us, Buddy, our family.
PAT: You're ruining us. If we stay with you, you'll take us down with you. This isn't political, Dick. This is our life.
NIXON: Everything's political, for Christ's sake! I'm political. And you're political, too!
PAT: No, I'm not! I'm finished.
NIXON: This is just what they want, Buddy. Don't you see it? They want to drive us apart. To beat us. We can't let them do it. We've been through too much together, Buddy ... We belong together.
PAT: That's what you said the first time we met. You didn't even know me.
