SCOTTIE: Midge!
MIDGE: Bye-bye!
ELSTER: You've done well, Scottie. You're good at your job.
SCOTTIE: That's Carlotta Valdes.
ELSTER: Yes.
SCOTTIE: There are things you didn't tell me.
ELSTER: I didn't know where she was going to lead you.
SCOTTIE: But you knew about this.
ELSTER: Oh, yes. You noticed the way she does her hair.
ELSTER: Something else. My wife, Madeleine, has several pieces of jewelry that belonged to Carlotta. She inherited them. Never wore them, they were too old-fashioned... until now. Now, when she is alone, she gets them out and looks at them handles them gently, curiously... puts them on and stares at herself in the mirror... and goes into that other world... is someone else again.
SCOTTIE: Carlotta Valdes was what: your wife's grandmother?
ELSTER: Great-grandmother. The child who was taken from her whose loss drove Carlotta mad and to her death - was Madeleine's grandmother.
SCOTTIE: Well, that explains it. Anyone could develop an obsession for the past, with a background like that.
ELSTER: But she doesn't know, about her background. She never heard of Carlotta Valdes.
SCOTTIE: Knows nothing of a grave out at Mission Dolores, or an old house an Eddy Street, or a portrait at the Palace of the Legion of Honor?
ELSTER: Nothing.
SCOTTIE: And when she goes to those places...
ELSTER: She is not my wife.
SCOTTIE: How do you know all these things she doesn't know?
ELSTER: Her mother told me most of then before she died. I dug out the rest for myself, here.
SCOTTIE: Why did she never tell her daughter?
ELSTER: Natural fear. Her grandmother went insane and took her own life. And the blood is in Madeleine. Scottie, I ask you to watch her closely.
