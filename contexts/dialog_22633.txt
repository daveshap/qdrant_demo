ISABELLA: It wasn't hard to spot the fakes until this past year. Then Tan got hold of one of a kind Swiss made hundred dollar plates -- and started making superbills.
LEE: And Hu Li killed him for the plates.
ISABELLA: Yes. They've printed and shipped one hundred million dollars, and there's only one way to spot a fake.
ISABELLA: They use an optical transfer ink from India that burns red -- the real ink burns black.
CARTER: What the hell are they going to do with a hundred million dollars in funny money?
ISABELLA: The real question is, where are the plates? If we can find the plates, we can stop the whole operation.
