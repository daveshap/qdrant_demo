My son isn't even two yet, but sat beside me through an anxiety attack.
So I was having an anxiety attack  in my kitchen. My son was watching TV in the next room and I could hear him. So I sat on the floor and started with the breathing. A few minutes later, he comes into the kitchen cocks his head to the side. He comes over kisses me on the forehead. Then he sits besides me on the floor with a toy and smiles at me then plays with his toy until I calm down. 

Must have done something right with this kid.
