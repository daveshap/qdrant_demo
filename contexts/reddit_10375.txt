I just really wish I wouldn't wake up tomorrow morning. Or any morning for that matter
I just want to say to you all, thank you. I turned my phone off for the day and went outside for a long walk today to help clear myself. It didn't help, but, it was better than the other thoughts that come across my mind throughout the day. I read all of your replies and just want to say thanks, and thanks to the ones that sent me direct messages too. This community is great to have people that are not selfish and care about others.
