What are the effects of laws regarding price gouging during times of crisis?
Texas has [a law](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/cpd/price-gouging) that prevents anyone in Texas from selling fuel, food, medicine, or other necessities during a disaster declared by the governor of Texas. Greg Abbott, the governor [has said](http://www.kltv.com/story/36274473/governor-vows-to-vigorously-prosecute-those-who-price-gouge-in-wake-of-harvey) they will "vigorously prosecute" people who price gauge during this crisis. A White House spokesperson has [said](http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/348750-white-house-price-gouging-of-harvey-victims-will-not-be-tolerated) that the DoJ will not tolerate price gouging and described it as taking advantage of a disaster victim.
