Kali Linux: Run penetration test and generate report for particular site? I am new in Kali Linux and recently one of my jobs is to use Kali Linux to scan a newly developed site and see if there are any security issue.And after going through some courses I found that, in Kali Linux there are a lot of tools that you can use to do scanning, but it seems that there is no a single tool, at least for a beginner, to just \"Scan a website and generate a report\".Can it be done?
