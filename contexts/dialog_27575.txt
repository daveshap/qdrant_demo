JOHANA: So have I. ... Hello?
JACQUES: I'm still here.
JOHANA: Well, then, talk to me some more.
JACQUES: ... It's hard you know. You're so far away and I don't know what else to say.
JOHANA: Then, tell me a story.
JACQUES: Uh... Ah! A story?
JACQUES: Do you know how it is? Do you know what you're supposed to do to meet a mermaid?
JOHANA: No... tell me.
JACQUES: You go down to the bottom of the sea, where the water isn't even blue anymore, where the sky is only a memory... and you float there, quietly, quietly and stay there... and you decide that you will die for them... Only then do they start coming out. They come and greet you and they judge the love you have for them... If it's sincere. If it's pure... They will be with you and take you away forever.
JACQUES: Hello?
JOHANA: It's me again.
JOHANA: I'm being a pain, huh?
JACQUES: ... Not at all.
JOHANA: You sure?
JACQUES: Absolutely positive.
JOHANA: Okay. In that case... I'm at the airport in Nice.
