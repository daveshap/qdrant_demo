STACY: Don't you think it meant anything to him. Even if I am fifteen?
LINDA: Stacy. What does it matter? He's a stereo salesman. You want to marry him? You want to have kids with him? You want this guy to come home, fifty years old, and he's still got that little Pacific Stereo badge on? Come on.
STACY: I should quit this job. I'm going to get so fat working here... nobody will ever take me out.
LINDA: Stacy. How many times do I have to tell you? You are really going to be beautiful... someday.
STACY: Thanks a lot.
