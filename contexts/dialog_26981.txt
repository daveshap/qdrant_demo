NICHOLAS: Get rid of them.
FEINGOLD: Hey, everyone -- snack time! Here... here you go...
FEINGOLD: Look, it was just a job. Nothing personal, ya know? I play my part, improvise a little. That's what I'm good at.
NICHOLAS: I'm tired of dealing with peons. I need to get to whoever's in charge.
FEINGOLD: Nobody knows, pal. Nobody gets the big picture... Jason, Tommy, cut it out!
FEINGOLD: Goddamnit, why do they do that?
NICHOLAS: How do I find them? Their offices are empty.
FEINGOLD: They own the whole building. They just move from floor to floor.
NICHOLAS: They know you... you worked for them. You can get me in.
FEINGOLD: No, I can't. I'm sorry and all, but...
NICHOLAS: Tell them the cops are after you... tell them you've got to talk to someone, I'm threatening to blow the whistle.
FEINGOLD: What whistle? There's no fucking whistle. This is fucking dangerous.
