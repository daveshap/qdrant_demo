High-Functioning Anxiety: Having the fear of not being taken seriously because I seem completely normal.
I hardly tell anyone I have anxiety because I’m afraid I won’t be taken seriously. My friends would describe me as outgoing and personable, but I do well in social situations only because I’m terrified of people not liking me— it feels like everything I say and every action I do in front of people is calculated. With being “social” along with doing well in school, I’m afraid no one would ever take me seriously if I told them that my brain is always ruminating, I can’t sleep, I have nightmares every night, dealing with panic attacks, etc. Does anyone deal with this? Has anyone with more “higher-functioning” anxiety successfully explained this to someone who was doubtful?
