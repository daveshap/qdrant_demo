CRAZED MAN: And... and... and he said... he asked me if I was married. And, I could see he had a gun in his hand.
SOMERSET: Where was the girl?
CRAZED MAN: What? What?
SOMERSET: Where was the prostitute? Where was she?
CRAZED MAN: She was... she was on the bed. She was just sitting on the bed.
SOMERSET: Who tied her down? You or him?
CRAZED MAN: He had a gun. He had a gun... and he made it happen. He made me do it! He made me put that... that thing on. Oh, Christ! He made me wear it... and... and he told me to fuck her. He had the gun in my mouth.
