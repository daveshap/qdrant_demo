What evidence is there to support the common claim that extensive news coverage of a mass shooter is one of the reasons behind the rise of mass shootings?
When a mass shooting occurs often times people will say that the extensive coverage of the perpetrator in the media is the cause of the rise in mass shootings, and that news media gives the shooter “what they want” (that being notoriety) by showing the shooters name and face: https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2018/2/22/17041382/school-shooting-media-coverage-perpetrator-parkland

Entire movements have started forming around this belief, such as the No Notoriety campaign, started by Tom and Caren Teves after their son Alex was murdered in the 2012 Aurora, CO movie theater shooting: https://nonotoriety.com

[Many news channels have taken measures] (https://www.adweek.com/tvnewser/anderson-cooper-chooses-not-to-name-orlando-killer/296027) [to not give perpetrators any notoriety by refusing to show the name, face or social media profiles of the shooter.] (https://www.adweek.com/tvnewser/when-to-name-and-not-to-name-mass-murderers/295975) Is this method effective?

Is there any legislation that could stop the news from giving coverage, given the First Amendment?
