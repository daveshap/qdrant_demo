Dear Interviewers...
please for the love of God, respect people's time. If I have to plan my whole weekend around a meeting, please have the decency to tell me more than 2 hours in advance that you can't be there. Don't have me arrive at a location 40 minutes away, only to email me 15 minutes late telling me you had other stuff that day. It's annoying, unprofessional, and honestly starts to hurt my image of the school you represent. 


  Sincerely,


  A frustrated applicant
