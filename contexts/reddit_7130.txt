Employment tips (UK) Forms and Employment Declaration for 1st job - Any Help?
I turned 20 and I'm on route to finishing my degree in a few months and I plan on getting into employment during the summer (this will be my first job ever). Getting into jobs is simple and easy to understand but what baffles me is the process after:

- What forms do I ask for when I get employed and which forms are crucial (e.g P45, P60, Any PAYE forms)?
- Do I instantly declare that I am employed?(If so, who do I declare it to?)
- Do I tell them the exact date I started work and my salary, or do I have to provide a document that shows all those details?
- Any other steps other than employment declaration that I need to know?
- If I terminate employment, do I go back and tell them that I am now currently not employed or do I show documents?

Concise information will be very appreciated
