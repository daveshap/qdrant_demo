ED: What d'you say, Elaine?
ELAINE: Not much -- you?
ED: Same.
ELAINE: Uh-huh.
ED: Last time I saw you, weren't you up for some equity-waiver thing?
ELAINE: Probably.
ED: I was gonna be in that Michael Mann movie, you know -- with Pacino and DeNiro. Got three callbacks.
ELAINE: Really.
ED: Didn't get it.
ELAINE: Well, those are the breaks.
ED: Not no more, they ain't. I quit that acting shit, man.
ELAINE: You just cooking then?
ED: Hell, no. I started writing.
UNCLE JOHN: We coulda used the other two-and-a-half grand.
STACY: There's more than a measly few grand in this.
UNCLE JOHN: There is?
STACY: Something's on.
UNCLE JOHN: What?
STACY: I happen to know more about Mr. Whatever- his-name-is than he thinks I know about him and his operation.
UNCLE JOHN: You do?
STACY: You bet.
UNCLE JOHN: Like what.
STACY: Like he'd never hire me for real. Not week-to-week. I don't have the credentials. He thinks I'm just a sociopath, someone he can turn to when he needs plausible denial.""
UNCLE JOHN: Well, we blew it, didn't we? He ain't wrong.
STACY: He ain't wrong." Listen
UNCLE JOHN: I don't get it.
STACY: I don't know who that English guy is. Some kind of -- -- courier or something. Maybe a seller. Maybe a buyer. But Mr. <u>Avery</u> wanted him, those jigs wanted him -- and I betcha there's a briefcase somewhere.
UNCLE JOHN: What's in it?
STACY: Drugs? Cash? Both if we're lucky.
UNCLE JOHN: How we gonna get that lucky?
STACY: While they're all fucking each other over ... couple of parties like us could move right in.
ED: I've been wondering something.
WILSON: Again?
ED: Do you have any friends, man?
WILSON: Yeah, I suppose. Call 'em that, yeah. Down the boozer Saturday night. Meet some of the lads.
ELAINE: Friends and <u>colleagues</u>.
WILSON: You can't count on very many people, that's the trouble. Number of times a decent job's been cocked up ...
ELAINE: Poor baby.
WILSON: Useless gits. I was gonna do the Post Office once.
ED: What post office?
WILSON: The lot. The whole British bloody Post Office. I had a brilliant plan -- all worked out -- work of genius, it was. Could I get anybody interested? No -- they're too busy pinching orange squash from the milkman. Lazy sods. Jumble sale on in Watford, they'll be up at the crack of dawn.
ELAINE: You're just on a higher plane, Wilson.
WILSON: Too bleeding true, 'n' it.
VALENTINE: Hello there.
SUSAN: What are you doing here?
VALENTINE: Exercising my visitation rights.
SUSAN: Since when?
VALENTINE: I miss my kids.
SUSAN: They're at college. Or doesn't your accountant even tell you where the money goes anymore.
VALENTINE: You've made it ... brighter.
SUSAN: I don't want you here, Terry.
VALENTINE: Sure you do.
SUSAN: What kind of trouble are you in?
VALENTINE: No trouble.
SUSAN: Surely you can think of somewhere else to take one of your chippies for a quick getaway.
VALENTINE: Susan.
