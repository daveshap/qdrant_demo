HIROKO: How much air-time have I got?
CASSIE: About thirty minutes. Those are slimmed-down tanks, so no stopping to admire the scenery.
HIROKO: Deal.
CASSIE: We've dumped the whole data-base from one of the cleaning remotes into the helmet. It'll project the route through the sewer system onto the inside of the glass as you go.
DRISCOLL: Yeah, I stripped down a motion tracker and hardwired it through to the helmet pick-ups, too. That's also on the display.
HIROKO: Sounds great.
PARSONS: It's not all good news. We had to take off the helmet lights. You'll be going in blind.
HIROKO: What? Why?
DRISCOLL: We had to. They were just too cumbersome for some of the conduits you're gonna have to negotiate. Besides, all the crap floating around reduces visibility to the extent where I doubt having helmet lights would have make that much difference, anyway. Maintenance lights down there oughta be enough to do the trick.
HIROKO: How tight are these shafts?
