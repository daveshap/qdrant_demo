Introverted SA Functional Areas- Assistantship Selection
I have applied for graduate schools at four institutions and now assistantships are coming out full swing. I have taken a big picture perusal of some of the different assistantships that are offered. Although I have not received official confirmation of being accepted or being invited to an interview I have begun looking at what's available. In addition, I received a lot of advice on how to pick assistantships. I was reading something on the sub and online and I saw something about introversion and being and introvert myself, I know my limits and where I can stretch myself. Now I know you may be saying, "You have to get used to some extroversion" which I am aware of. There are some preferences I am looking for in my work environment:

*Office- No open office environments- someone what semi-private.
*Personal connections- I desire to work with students one-on-one in advising/counseling settings. Although I can navigate small talk, it is something I do not care for.
*Areas of self-reflection where I can think, read, brainstorm, planning, writing, and reflect to help execute best practices and contribute to the office I want to work for. Also, a place where we can process thoughts and feelings
*Public speaking/Teaching- Public speaking a big weakness of mine and I know it's something that I have to improve if I ever get asked. However, doing it on a daily basis is not for me as it will dry my batteries completely. Large audiences (no. Done it before in front of 4,500+ and it was the most nerve-wracking thing ever) Teaching I would not mind doing if it were a small group setting.
*Supervision and management- Although I have expereince in it, my approach is very laid back. I lay out the expectations, and I can trust whoever I supervise that they can follow; however, I don't like being a micromanager.
*No frequent networking- I know how to turn on my extroversion when needed, but doing it everyday would be too much (this is at networking events and conferences)
*Surface level transactional advising- one word: no. Deep-interactions matter 

So I am trying to find functional areas to look for when keeping this all in mind. My initial thought for functional areas to go into are:

*counseling (an area I am interested in, not sure as a career)
*career services (I think would fit well with my goal to become a college planning consultant, this all depends on the job description asked)
*academic advising/services (Great as well!)
*Admissions & Enrollment (I think it would enhance my goals to understand about admissions, but again the public speaking in large audiences is the only thing I am concerned about. Fairs are not as much of a concern to me.
*Multiculutral Student Services (Since colleges may have different functions, I would prefer something in diversity education or peer mentoring)
*Disability Services and Resources ( Maybe something in  disability advocacy- working one on one with students and helping students meet their needs.)
*Financial Aid and Scholarships (This would be an area for practicum to aid my goal as a consultant, but may not long-term.

These are a lot of ideas I was thinking that would fit well with my introversion. I was wondering if there are any functional areas that are good for introverts that I have not considered?
