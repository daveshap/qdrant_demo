What if every-time you upvoted something reddit donated .01 cents to charity.
Edit:1/100th of a cent not 1 cent

Edit2: they could have like a cap on the money donated

Edit3: downvoting would not take the money from the charity

Edit4: we could complete team trees goal

edit5: it would take 159,545,000 upvotes based on .01 cents per upvote to complete team trees

edit6:what if every account had like a 25 cents a day cap or some number around that
