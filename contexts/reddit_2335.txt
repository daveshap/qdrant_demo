Okay, but is it just me, or do a lot of college essays just seem really pretentious?
I’ve been binge-watching videos of people reading their essays, and in addition to this, I’ve been reading some online. What I’ve noticed is that people go into minute detail about something so oddly specific. They paint these overly descriptive scenes, going on tangents about what they smelled, felt, and saw. I swear I saw an essay where a student described the texture and curve of a tree branch, and never mentioned it again. I’m just so confused about why so many college essays seem like a creative writing piece. Has anyone been admitted to a good college without having elaborate never-ending sentences that don’t contribute to the message/narrative?
