Should I take out private student loans for going to graduate school full time?
Iâ€™ll be going starting my M.S. in the fall, and received some aid in the form of a federal in subsidized loan, and the interest rate is ~6%. Has anyone had any experience with private loans for grad school at a better rate? Let me know your thoughts. Thanks!
