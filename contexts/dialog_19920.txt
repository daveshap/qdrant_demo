JAMES: We are living in cloudcuckooland -- we'll never get this done today.
ANNA: We have to. I've got to be in New York on Thursday.
JAMES: Oh, stop showing off.
JAMES: God, that's an enormous arse.
ANNA: I'm not listening.
JAMES: No, but seriously -- it's not fair -- so many tragic young teenagers with anorexia -- and that girl has an arse she could perfectly well share round with at least ten other women -- and still be beg-bottomed.
ANNA: I said I'm not listening -- and I think, looking at something that firm, you and your droopy little excuse for an 'arse' would be well-advised to keep quiet.
ANNA: So I ask you when you're going to tell everyone, and you say...?
JAMES: 'Tomorrow will be soon enough.'
ANNA: And then I... right.
JAMES: Who was that rather difficult chap you were talking to on the way up?
ANNA: Oh... no one... no one. Just some... guy from the past. I don't know what he's doing here. Bit of an awkward situation.
