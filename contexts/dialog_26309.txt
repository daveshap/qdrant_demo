MR. DANVERS: No plans for the weekend, Linda?
LINDA: No, MR. Danvers.
MR. DANVERS: Can't have you moping around the campus. Why don't you come home with us for dinner?
LINDA: I'd love to.
BIANCA: Is he your entertainment for tonight?
SELENA: He will be. In about five minutes.
BIANCA: Have fun.
SELENA: Finished your estimate?
ETHAN: Well, there's several ways to go .
SELENA: Come in, have a drink, we'll talk.
SELENA: You must be very popular in the neighborhood. I always see your truck parked around.
ETHAN: I have a lot of repeat business. People seem to like my service.
SELENA: I bet they do.
ETHAN: What's that big black scar on the ground? Like a fire.
SELENA: Oh, you know how parties are. Always some damage.
