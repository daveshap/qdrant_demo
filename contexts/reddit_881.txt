Please forgive your mind/body for the anxiety, it's doing the best it can given the circumstances.
I think I needed to hear that today, so I thought it might help you too.

Wow I didn't expect this to get so much attention! I wish I saw this sooner. I usually come here when I'm feeling anxious and tonight... well, tonight has been kind of a doozie. Thank you all, seeing all these responses has actually stopped me from shaking so badly. I love you all for your strength and kindness <3 

I appreciate the comments and upvotes (and the gold goodness me!), I'm really glad I could help someone else. This stuff sucks. You've helped me a lot tonight, thank you <3
