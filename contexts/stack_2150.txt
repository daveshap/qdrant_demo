Why does my PS4 keep deleting my updates randomly? About four or five months ago, my PS4 deleted all of the updates for Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 and it told me that my data was corrupt so I had to delete it and reinstall. This was annoying on its own, but I downloaded 19GB worth of updates and hopped on for a game with my friends. I started lagging so bad that I rage quit and started playing a different game. I booted BO3 up again the next day and my updates had deleted themselves again. Getting really annoyed, I quit BO3 and played a different game for about a month. Something I should mention is that my PS4 seemed to believe that I had the digital version of BO3, which I did not. Then, I decided that I was going to re-download it one last time and this time it worked. In February of this year, I got the new Call of Duty (IW) and I downloaded 15 GB worth of updates. I started playing and enjoyed myself. However, now, in March, I got two new games. Once I installed both of them, IW's updates got destroyed again, but I didn't mind that much. I updated my new games (4GB 15GB) and I played them yesterday. Today, I booted my PS4 up and my updates are gone again. It appears that no one else on the internet is having this problem, except those with Xboxes, but that doesn't help me. How do I fix this?I have tried. My PS4 has about 40GB worth of space left, though I don't think that thats the actual number.
