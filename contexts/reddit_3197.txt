New Yorkers/Americans, what are the best job hunt websites or strategies to use when applying?
I’m a US citizen born abroad and I’m planning to move to NY within 7 months. I feel like professional culture where I’m from is very different from that of the US, and NY specifically. Any tips for finding a job, particularly one related to Ad, Marketing, or Graphic Design? Any entry level job is good for me.
