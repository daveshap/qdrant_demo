Trump so far â€” a special project of r/NeutralPolitics. Two years in, what have been the successes and failures of the Trump administration?
One question that gets submitted quite often on r/NeutralPolitics is some variation of:

> Objectively, how has Trump done as President? 

The mods have never approved such a submission, because under Rule A, it's overly broad. But given the repeated interest, we're putting up our own version here.

--------

There are many ways to judge the chief executive of any country and there's no way to come to a broad consensus on all of them. **US President Donald Trump has been in office for two years now. What are the successes and failures of his administration so far?**

What we're asking for here is a review of specific actions by the Trump administration that are within the stated or implied duties of the office. This is not a question about your personal opinion of the president. Through the sum total of the responses, we're trying to form the most objective picture of this administration's various initiatives and the ways they contribute to overall governance.

Given the contentious nature of this topic (especially on Reddit), we're handling this a little differently than a standard submission. The mods here have had a chance to preview the question and some of us will be posting our own responses. The idea here is to contribute some early comments that we know are well-sourced and vetted, in the hopes that it will prevent the discussion from running off course. 

Users are free to contribute as normal, but please keep our [rules on commenting](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_comment_rules) in mind before participating in the discussion. Although the topic is broad, please **be specific** in your responses. Here are some potential topics to address:

* Appointments
* Campaign promises
* Criminal justice
* Defense
* Economy
* Environment
* Foreign policy
* Healthcare
* Immigration
* Rule of law
* Public safety
* Tax cuts
* Tone of political discourse
* Trade

Let's have a productive discussion about this very relevant question.
