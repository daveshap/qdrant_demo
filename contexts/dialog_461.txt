LINDSEY: What are you still wearing that for?
BUD: I don't know. Divorce ain't final. Forgot to take it off.
LINDSEY: I haven't worn mine in months.
BUD: Yeah, what's-his-name wouldn't like it. The Suit.
LINDSEY: Do you always have to call him that? The Suit? It makes you sound like such a hick. His name is Michael.
BUD: So what about Michael" then... Mr. Brooks Brothers... Mr. BMW. You still seeing him?"
LINDSEY: No, I haven't seen him in a few weeks.
BUD: What happened?
LINDSEY: Bud, why are you doing this? It's not part of you life any more.
BUD: I'll tell you what happened... you woke up one day and realized the guy never made you laugh.
LINDSEY: You're right, Bud. It was just that simple. Aren't you clever? You should get your own show... Ask Dr. Bud, advice to the lovelorn from three hundred fathoms.
