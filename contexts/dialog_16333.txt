LOGAN: We're leaving.
OLD MAN: What a pity. I was hoping you'd be here to bury me.
JESSICA: Come with us.
OLD MAN: Where are you going?
LOGAN: To a city with thousands and thousands of people.
OLD MAN: Alive?
OLD MAN: Thousands and thousands... as many as my cats?
LOGAN: More... many more.
OLD MAN: And all alive you say?
