26yr old just got a 50% raise by almost quitting job for another offer
**I somehow got a 50% raise at work.**

I was offered another position doing similar work, but with better pay. When I informed my boss that I was leaving for another job, they asked me to wait a day to get a counteroffer approved.

The next day, the head of the office offered me a new title and a 50% raise from **60k to 90k** as my base salary. 

I did also just finish my MBA, but did not expect this big of a raise this quickly.

Just wanted to share this story as an example of how much of a raise you can get if you have some type of leverage, such as another job offer.
