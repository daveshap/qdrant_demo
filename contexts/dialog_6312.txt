MOONAN: Do you want to know the first time I had a line on Vig? He sent me a birthday card. Belated, but it's the thought, right? Oh, this prick's got a sense of humor. But, then again you guys probably know him better than I do. In fact, I've only met the guy once. But now, now I have you. The next best thing. His partners. His Fix.""
SOBOZINSKI: What do you want?
MOONAN: You help me catch him. Whatever he's into next, I want you to be into. And what you're into, I'm into. If it all goes well, those two guys from IAD will never have to hear this tape. I'll clear you guys of anything you've ever done with Vig under the guise of some cross- departmental investigation. This prick's been on the wish list for so long, you'll probably get gold shields out of it.
SOBOZINSKI: What do you get out of it?
MOONAN: Peace of mind.
SOBOZINSKI: That's it?
MOONAN: Not everyone's on the take, Walter.
ROTTOVICH: If you Feds are so hot for him, why don't we just bring him in right now?
MOONAN: I want him for something big and to do that, we have to catch him in the act.
SOBOZINSKI: This guy must have been a real pain in your dick.
MOONAN: Literally. It's not a bad deal, gentleman. I get peace of mind. You get Detective Sheilds. But this is the best part, Walter... Walter, your daughter will get to keep her braces and have that winning smile. Capice?
