Graduated, Unemployed, and Attending a Conference. How do I explain that Sciatica has held me back and slowly taken over my life? I'd rather not mention it when networking but how else do I explain what I'm doing in my life?
Hi there! 

I'm attending my first APA conference soon and I'm not sure how to present myself. 

Here's a backstory: I graduated (undergrad) in May 2019, with a BA in psychology and a minor in business administration. While most people get a job related to their field after they graduate, I had the opposite experience. A few months after graduating, I had to quit the job I had during my time in college to go through 3 hip procedures, a few steroid injections, the list is nauseating. Anyways, I've experienced progressive pain for the last 2 years, and have been diagnosed with Piriformis Syndrome and Sciatica. After graduating, it seems like my body decided to just freak out and forget how to function.

In a perfect world, I would go to a doctoral program for clinical neuropsychology or have a position at a facility for clinical research. But as things currently stand, I have a degree that I'm sitting on, no school affiliation, no past internship, little to no experience in my field, no job, and possible limitations on my future due to my pain. 

This conference will be full of accomplished doctors, with years of experience, achievements, publications, all the works. During any networking, getting to know people includes asking about what they do or what they're working on. What exactly am I supposed to say about myself? *"Yeah hi, I'm an insomniatic blob of pain and don't really know if I can function well enough to complete grad school but I love research so do you have any job openings?"*

Any advice would be great, as it's quite intimidating and I'm very nervous about self-presentation when there isn't anything to present.  *Thank you in advance!*
