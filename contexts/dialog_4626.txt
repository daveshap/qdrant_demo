ABBOTT: And what are we looking for?
PAMELA: I want to know about Treadstone.
ABBOTT: To know about it? It was a kill squad. Black on black. Closed down two years ago. Nobody wants to know about Treadstone. Not around here. You better take this back to Marty and make sure he knows what you're doing.
PAMELA: He does. I've been down to the archives. I have the files, Ward.
PAMELA: Let's talk about Conklin.
ABBOTT: What are you after, Pam? You want to fry me? You want my desk? Is that it?
PAMELA: I want to know what happened.
ABBOTT: What happened? Jason Bourne happened. You've got the files? Then let's cut the crap. It went wrong. Conklin had these guys wound so tight they were bound to snap. Bourne was his number one -- guy went out to work, screwed the op and never came back. Conklin couldn't fix it, couldn't find Bourne, couldn't adjust. It all went sideways. Finally there were no options left.
PAMELA: So you had Conklin killed. I mean, if we're cutting the crap...
ABBOTT: I've given thirty years and two marriages to this agency. I've shoveled shit on four continents. I'm due to retire next year and believe me, I need my pension, but if you think I'm gonna sit here and let you dangle me with this, you can go to hell. Marshall too. It had to be done.
PAMELA: And Bourne? Where's he now?
ABBOTT: Dead in a ditch? Drunk in a bar in Mogadishu? Who knows?
PAMELA: I think I do. We had a deal going down in Berlin last week. During the buy, both our Field Agent and the seller were killed. We pulled a fingerprint from a timing charge that didn't go off. They were killed by Jason Bourne.
