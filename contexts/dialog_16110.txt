GEORGE: Did you tell him he's spending the summer with me?
SAM: No I'm not!
ROBIN: What was I supposed to do? When you didn't show up Saturday, I tried to call. Your phone isn't working.
GEORGE: I don't have a phone.
ROBIN: I drove over and you were gone.
GEORGE: I can't leave the house?
ROBIN: Last time you were gone for a week!
GEORGE: Did you tell him he was spending the summer with me?
ROBIN: No. I was going to let you do that.
GEORGE: He's not spending the summer in Tahoe.
SAM: Who are you, anyway? I don't even know you.
GEORGE: You'll know me by the time we're through.
SAM: I'm not going!
GEORGE: I'll get your bag.
SAM: Mom, tell him I'm not going. You already promised me!
GEORGE: You have everything?
ROBIN: I did say he could go.
GEORGE: Let's go.
SAM: I'm not going!
GEORGE: You don't have a choice.
SAM: Mom...please.
ROBIN: George --
GEORGE: He's not spending the entire summer with another kid in Tahoe. If he leaves, I will follow him up there and I will drag him home by his nose ring. He can hate me. You can hate me. He can try to kill me while I sleep. You can call the police. You can call your husband or your attorney, but Sam is spending the summer with me. He's my son. He's sixteen. That's it.
