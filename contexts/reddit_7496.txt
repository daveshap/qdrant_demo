Is Oncotarget a predatory journal?
Hi. For one of the PI that I really want to join, one of his previous visiting scholars had a paper published on Oncotarget and thus this paper is attached to his personal page. The director of my department said Oncotarget is a predatory journal and this can be a red flag. But this PI has an R01 NIH funding with a primary faculty member of my department as the co-PI. I'm really confused now. Is this a major red flag that this PI is problematic and thus I shouldn't join his lab? Like if a paper published on a predatory journal is such a big issue (assuming Oncotarget is predatory), then why he still has that paper attached on his personal page and had an R01 NIH funding with a co-PI from my department's primary faculty members? Thanks
