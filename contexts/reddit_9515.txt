I turned around my finances over the past year and finally have >0 net worth
Y'all, I finally built up my 6 month emergency fund plus a few extra thousand in savings. Ironically, even though I'm now a miserly graduate student, this is about twice as much money in the bank compared to when my yearly income was twice as high.

Also, I paid off my student loans using the money from my tax returns. On top of that, I just won an extremely prestigious fellowship that will guarantee funding for my PhD for 3 more years and will put me at the median US income (not to mention the many opportunities that follow with the fellowship).

I'm looking forward to finally work on investments and not feel like the ground will fall from under me
