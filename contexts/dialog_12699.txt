EXAMINER: Didn't look like it came from Toys-Are-Us"
BRENNA: Didn't think it was my buddy over there.
EXAMINER: Figured you knew more about swords than I did.
BRENNA: Claymore.
EXAMINER: Huh?
BRENNA: Scottish claymore. Take a French epee, add twenty pounds of ballast so it means business, and you've got a claymore.
EXAMINER: You're the expert.
BRENNA: It's in good condition.
MORAN: This your present address?
TAUPIN: Yes.
MORAN: Mr.- Taupin, what were you doing in that alley?
TAUPIN: I was walking by when I heard a shout. Your men came right after.
MORAN: Did you know the victim?
TAUPIN: No.
MORAN: His name was Iman Fasil if that jogs your memory.
TAUPIN: It doesn't.
MORAN: He was carrying a Syrian passport and had been in the country less than a week.
MORAN: Two days ago a Bulgarian national was murdered the same way. He'd also been in the country less than a week. What is your citizenship?
TAUPIN: American.
MORAN: Do you make a habit of hanging out in that neigh- borhood at night?
TAUPIN: What are you getting at?
MORAN: Let's just say that in my years with this department I've seen more than one well dressed business man look for a hand job on 14th Street.
MORAN: What were _you_ looking for?
TAUPIN: That's none of your business.
MORAN: You're wrong.
MORAN: Do you know what this is?
TAUPIN: I presume it's a sword.
MORAN: A claymore to be exact. You wouldn't know anything about it would you?
TAUPIN: Your murder weapon?
MORAN: It was covered with Mr. Fasil's fingerprints, but none of his blood.
TAUPIN: A mystery.
MORAN: For the moment.
