What REAL jobs can you do from computer?
I need to start working soon and it would be really convenient if I could work with my laptop instead of in a bar, but literally everything I find on the Internet is all about surveys, Amazon mturk, transcribing and all those coin gathering jobs.

I need ideas (or information) on what jobs you can learn, study, do and get hired for. Dont know much (anything) about this, but some words ive heard are server management, database administrator...

Thank you and sorry for my English :)
