KIRKEBY: Stay with it, Buddy-boy! Come on, Sylvia.
SYLVIA: What gives?
KIRKEBY: A little mixup in signals. Let's go.
SYLVIA: Go where?
KIRKEBY: What's your mother doing this afternoon?
SYLVIA: She's home -- stuffing a turkey.
KIRKEBY: Why don't we send her to a movie -- like Ben-Hur?
SYLVIA: That's fine. But what are we going to do about grandma and Uncle Herman and Aunt Sophie and my two nieces --
FRAN: Who was that?
BUD: Just somebody delivering a bottle of champagne. Like some?
FRAN: Would you mind opening the window?
BUD: Now don't go getting any ideas, Miss Kubelik.
FRAN: I just want some fresh air.
BUD: It's only one story down -- the best you can do is break a leg.
FRAN: So they'll shoot me -- like a horse.
BUD: Please, Miss Kubelik, you got to promise me you won't do anything foolish.
FRAN: Who'd care?
BUD: I would.
FRAN: Why can't I ever fall in love with somebody nice like you?
BUD: Yeah. Well -- that's the way it crumbles, cookie-wise. Go to sleep.
