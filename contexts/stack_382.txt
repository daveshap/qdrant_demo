The \"edit\" option is missing from the Ubuntu Software installer This means I am unable to add or modify the repositories using the GUI.The only options on the menu are:Software and UpdatesAboutQuitI'm running the software center as a user, not as root or sudo - it asks for my password when I install something.Clicking on \"About\" says the software is called Ubuntu Software version  3.20.1.
