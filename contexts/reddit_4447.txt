I'm fucking done...
 I'm so fucking done. I want to just die already. I have autism and I  can't hold a fucking job. I can't support myself. 17 jobs in 5 years.  Average stay at a job is 60 days. Social Security insists I am not  eligible to get help, but I can't hold down a job. I feel like the world  is telling me I am not welcome on this earth. I am tired of being a  pariah, a "freak of nature". I didn't fucking choose to be born this  way. I am tired of being poor and destitute because I happened to be  born with a disability. I am tired of people constantly telling me it  will get better. It doesn't. The only way out of this torment I can see  left is to end it all.
