I just want someone to be proud
I’ve saved my first ever $10,000 this year. I never thought I could do it and I just want to motivate others that even though it’s tough, it’s possible

Edit: this post has BLOWN up. Holy cow really grateful for all the nice comments. 

A lot of people have been asking ‘How’ and I don’t have a special formula on how to get rich. I just saved every chance I could without being a ‘cheapskate’. Only went out to nice dinners sparingly, shop at discount stores. 

The biggest money saver for me was food. It’s boggling how much money you can save if you do a bit of meal prep.


Edit 2: holy cow guys. Just saw my post in r/rimjob_steve and I’m nothing short but honored lol. 

I hope this positively effects everyone it comes.

Edit 3: why are some people dm’ing me trying to sell me on an investment strategy of theirs? I’m not interested thank you.
