In few hours it’s over
Shortly after midnight (between 2:00-3:00) I’m going to hang myself. I refused to live a hopeless, pathetic and miserable life anymore. I’ve written a very short note to my mother. I’m terrified but I must do it.

Fuck you cruel world!

Edit: thank you for the positive comments but I’m domed. Believe me I badly want to live and in the past 4 years I did everything I could to feel better but I don’t belong in this world. Where I’m it’s 23:00 so I’ve 3-4 hours left. Only reason I will wait for few hours is so I can do it when everyone is asleep. I don’t want to be interrupted.
