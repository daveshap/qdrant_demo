not having a best friend
So I have really really close friends. I was so quick to call people my “best friend” in middle school and freshmen year and they ended up leaving me. Today, I have a group of friends whom I’m very close with. I see that X and Y (example) are best friends, and I also see that A and B ( again example) are best friends. I do love my close friends but I feel like there’s nobody who’s actually my ride or die or anybody who actually connects to me. It feels lonely. Everyone has a best friend, it seems to be a great thing. Am I wrong?
