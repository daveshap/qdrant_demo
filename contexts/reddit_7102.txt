Small side business on-top of School
As I am at high school (currently in the last year) I've been looking to get a side job to help make some extra money. I am interested in computers and am applying for a course in computer science but I only have a shitty computer functional skills qualification (pretty much just showing you can copy  and paste) because that's all my school offers.
I'm experienced with computer software and find stuff like this easy. I was recommended to do something like this after I removed a virus from my friends parents computer. They got a quote from pc world for Â£60 but didn't send it in to be fixed.

My idea is to start a side business to install programmes, software and remove thinga like viruses. Anything to do with software. Nothing to do with hardware or fixing broken parts only software. I was wondering if this is a good idea and how I might start something like this?
