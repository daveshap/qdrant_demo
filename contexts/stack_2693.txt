Reduce GEE memory usage? I am working with global applications and decided to use the Python Earth Engine API to collect some data I will need. I am exporting annual, global NDVI composites based on Landsat. Since this involves a lot of data, I split the task in small tiles leading to about 1000 downloads to be conducted. Due to the high numbers of tasks, I run into a 500 error after a while, which is becoming quite annoying.My question is this: after downloading a file, is there a way to clear the memory used to derive that file?
