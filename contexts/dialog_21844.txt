DADDY: Her plan is obvious, plain as day. She's going on a hunger strike. The question is, how do we foil her?
MOTHER: She's just nervous and worried. And you would be, too, if you had no job and no place to go.
DADDY: Something has got to be done or Rose is going to be in this house forever.
DADDY: Well, I have got news! I called long distance and spoke to Cousin Hop and you'll be glad to know, Rose, I have found you a job!
ROSE: Tennessee?
DADDY: Yes, Tennessee, a lovely state!
ROSE: Well. What kinda job is it?
DADDY: Ahh-hh, you'll like it. It's a fine, outdoor-type job.
ROSE: You mean a farm?
DADDY: No, no, not exactly. It isn't a farm in the sense that it's a farm. Not at all. It's a... dairy establishment. You'll 1ike it! I'm sure you'll like it because it's so... peaceful!
MOTHER: Honey, Rose was born on a farm and has terrible memories of farm life. Now I don't think --
DADDY: Just a minute, Rose, you don't understand. This isn't a dirt farm like the one you were born on, it's nice. A neighbor of Cousin Hop's, I talked to him on the phone, a fine man... it's not a farm, damn it, it's a beautiful dairy establishment! Stop crying, Rose! Do you hear me? Stop crying, it's ideal!
MOTHER: I don't know how you can call it ideal -- don't you know what the word farm" means to her?"
DADDY: I don't give a hoot in hell's hollow what it means to her! She can't stay in this house forever! I fired her, damn it!
MOTHER: It sounds like a farm to me. Calling it a dairy establishment, that's just trickery and flummery.
DADDY: Trickery and flummery or not, she's going there tomorrow on the bus! It's settled! And I must say we've been more than fair to you, Rose, it's pretty selfish and mean hearted of you to sit there and cry like that!
ROSE: I'm not cryin' because of me, I'm cryin' because of somebody else.
DADDY: What?
