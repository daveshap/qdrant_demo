CAL: What made you think you could put your hands on my fiancee?! Look at me, you filth! What did you think you were doing?!
ROSE: Cal, stop! It was an accident.
CAL: An accident?!
ROSE: It was... stupid really. I was leaning over and I slipped.
ROSE: I was leaning way over, to see the... ah... propellers. And I slipped and I would have gone overboard... and Mr. Dawson here saved me and he almost went over himself.
CAL: You wanted to see the propellers?
