Need Advice on Dating with Hobbies
Hello everyone. I've been lurking reddit for a while, and so many stories have inspired me to start posting on here, so here goes.


I'm 17/M, and I have an admitted history of being overly shy when it comes to talking to girls. I have, however worked on this and have mostly overcome this, with a combination of maturing and having supportive friends.


I've started to get serious with a few girls before, but have stopped short from dating, mostly because they cut me off before I had a chance to really ask them out, and they would end up dating several guys which have ended up in disaster.


Now, I'm a pretty well rounded guy who is both nice and fun, and, not to sound self righteous, I have been told I'm good looking as well. On the flip side though, I take part in rather geeky hobbies, such as gaming, Warhammer 40k table top, and Magic: the gathering, just to name a few. While this hasn't presented itself to be a problem yet, I'm a bit nervous for any future relationships I may get in to. More times than not when I meet a girl, they see the nice, fun, party side of me. However, there is a geeky side to me as well, and I fear that when a girl sees that side, she will no longer be interested in me. 


In such a case, I'm probably better off, but on the other hand, this is likely to become a repetitive cycle, seeing as the girls I meet are at social events with friends. I pretty much just want advice on how to handle this sort of situation, if anyone has experience with this sort of thing. 


To those who read all of this, you are truly awesome and deserve a cookie. Thanks for reading!
