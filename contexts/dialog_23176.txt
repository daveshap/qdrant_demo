DETECTIVE KINCAID: Before you jump to conclusions, the man in the picture, COTTON WEARY, is out of the country on business. His alibi checks out. Seems he's got a TV show in Australia, 100% COTTON. It's supposedly the biggest thing down under since Yahoo Serious, but that's besides the point.
DEWEY: What does this have to do with Sid?
DETECTIVE KINCAID: Who knows more about Maureen Prescott than her own daughter?
DEWEY: Well Sid's dad couldn't help you and he was married to Maureen.
