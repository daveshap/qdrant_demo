GLENN: Wait a minute. I'm letting <i>you</i> in on this, not all your friends.
MAURICE: You just ask me how we gonna do it. That's what I'm here for, tell you how. We the experts.
MAURICE: Thing I'm worried about is you.
GLENN: Me?
MAURICE: Yeah. If you can step up and actually do it. Understand? 'Stead of just talking the talk.
GLENN: Can I do what?
MAURICE: Walk in a house with me, do this cross- dressin' nigga named Eddie Solomon I used to sell to been dealin' on his own.
GLENN: What-- when?
MAURICE: Right now, son.
GLENN: I don't have to prove shit to you. The Ripley job is <i>my</i> job. You're either in or you're not. You wanna pop some crack dealer pissed you off, that's your problem, not mine.
MAURICE: Look, Glenn, I know you cool, but you don't have to give me no tone of voice, okay? You don't like what I'm saying, you can get out anywhere along here you want.
GLENN: I think you're forgetting, this is my car. I drove it up here.
MAURICE: Hey, shit, come on. I say I want this car, man, it's mine. You go get yourself another one. I say I'm in on Ripley? I'm in, with or without <i>your</i> ass. I say I want you to come along on another job, see if you for real or not, guess what you gonna do?
