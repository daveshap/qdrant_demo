LASZLO: I'm sure you'll excuse me if I am not gracious, but you see, Major Strasser, I'm a Czechoslovakian.
STRASSER: You were a Czechoslovakian. Now you are a subject of the German Reich!
LASZLO: I've never accepted that privilege, and I'm now on French soil.
STRASSER: I should like to discuss some matters arising from your presence on French soil.
LASZLO: This is hardly the time or the place.
STRASSER: Then we shall state another time and another place. Tomorrow at ten in the Prefect's office, with Mademoiselle.
LASZLO: Captain Renault, I am under your authority. Is it your order that we come to your office?
RENAULT: Let us say that it is my request. That is a much more pleasant word.
LASZLO: Very well.
RENAULT: Mademoiselle.
STRASSER: Mademoiselle.
