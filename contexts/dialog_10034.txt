JOHN: You used to be on the job?
SHEPARD: Yeah, long time ago. I know you?
JOHN: I look familiar?
SHEPARD: No. What house you work?
JOHN: The 2-3. Homicide.
SHEPARD: A hot shot, huh?
JOHN: Nah, just working the job.
SHEPARD: I hear that.
JOHN: As a matter of fact, I caught a case that goes back to your day...one of the Nightingale murders.
SHEPARD: No kiddin'?
JOHN: No. Missing teenager. Disappeared thirty years ago. Found her bones last week. Buried behind some old diner, up by Dyckman street. Mary Finelli.
SHEPARD: Huh.
JOHN: Talk about dumb luck. Odds of anybody finding that girl, thirty years later. And then the chances of hitting a dental...forget about it. Bets part is she's the first victim. She knew the doer. I'm betting those bones are gonna do a lot of talking.
