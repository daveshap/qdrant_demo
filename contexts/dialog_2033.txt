MELVIN: Nice of you... thank you.
CAROL: Thank you.
MELVIN: Now I want you to do something for me.
CAROL: Oh, I'm sorry... Didn't I say, what?" I thought I said
MELVIN: I want you to go on this trip.
CAROL: No, sir...
MELVIN: I can't do this alone. I'm afraid he'll pull the stiff one eye on me. I need you to chaperon. Separate everything but cars. You said you liked convertibles. Now I'm on the hook.
CAROL: The stiff one eye?
MELVIN: Two days.
CAROL: I can't. I work.
MELVIN: You take off when you have to.
CAROL: My son.
MELVIN: Bettes tells me he's doing fine.
CAROL: Melvin, I'd rather not.
MELVIN: What's that got to do with it?
CAROL: Funny, I thought it was a strong point.
MELVIN: Write me a note and ain't she sweet. I need a hand and where'd she go.
CAROL: Are you saying accepting your help obligates me!?
MELVIN: Is there another way to see it?
CAROL: No.
