JUNIOR: Why in the hell didn't you help mama?
BABE BROTHER: I told her I would if she would give me time.
JUNIOR: I bet you if your master would have told you to fix the hole in the roof, you would have rebuilt the whole damn house.
BABE BROTHER: You always got the best of it around here and when Dad always talks about my son, it is always you, so you fix the roof.
JUNIOR: That is a damn lie and you know it. Every time father asks you to do something, you either half-ass do it or run off and hide. Mama asked you to turn the dirt in her garden and you told her, with your smart ass self, that you weren't a farmer; get Junior to do it. Every time someone asks you to do something, you always say, tell Junior to do it. Boy, you ought to grow up.
BABE BROTHER: I told you about calling me boy. I ain't no boy. See, you and Dad got a bad habit of calling me boy. You call me boy in front of my wife. You think I'm going to fix the roof? I hope the wind blows the whole damn thing off and it pours down rain.
JUNIOR: I ought to break your damn neck.
BABE BROTHER: I'm leaving and don't even call me when the shoe falls 'cause all he did for me was to try and run my life. I'm tired of people saying Babe Brother this, Babe Brother that. What's my name?
JUNIOR: You dumb ass, it's Babe Brother.
BABE BROTHER: My name is Sam. Samuel.
