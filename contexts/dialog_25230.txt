SAAVIK: Yes, Admiral. But that may not be possible.
KIRK: What? What are you saying?
SAAVIK: The Katra ritual is meant to deposit Spock's consciousness in the Hall of Ancient Thought - not in his body.
KIRK: But we have Spock alive! That's more than we bargained for!
SAAVIK: Or less. What you describe is called Fal Tor Pan - the refusion. It is very dangerous. The elders may not choose to attempt it.
KIRK: And if they don't.? What will Happen to Spock?
SAAVIK: . He will remain always as he is.
SULU: The planet Vulcan. In hailing distance, sir.
KIRK: Saavik. Send to Ambassador Sarek. Tell him we're coming in.
