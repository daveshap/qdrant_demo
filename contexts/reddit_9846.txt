Departmental Resume
My supervisor shared a google doc called "Departmental Resume" with the  office and attached a message that went along the lines of this: 

"This will be able to show the level of experience and diversity of educational and career backgrounds we have within our office. We will likely be formatting it for use in professional staff recruitment materials (when we are in a position to hire additional people) and also for our website and other materials about Res Life."

Does anyone else do this? And if so, have you found it helpful with the intended purposes (or others)?
