New employer wants the right to check my text msgs
My new employer wants me to sign a policies and procedures manual that makes a point to say something to the effect of:

> No cell phone use allowed outside breaks. The employer reserves the right to check your text messages to make sure no texts are being sent during business hours.

No cell phone use is fine and standard. But checking my phone? What the hell?

Do I sign and cross that bridge if my boss ever tries to check my phone? Or do I refuse to sign? Thanks for your help.

Edit: This is an administrative assistant position to an office in the legal profession.
