RUBY: That's right... it... it came right out of his chest...
HAYES: Who's chest?
RUBY: Jason's. It came out of his chest... a hand with long blades on the fingers...
RUBY: And this hand... it... it slashed Doctor Layton's throat... and the Deputy. Then it grabbed Danny by the head... And it pulled his head right down into his chest... I couldn't... Hayes lays a hand his shoulder.
HAYES: Take it easy, Ruby...	it's all right. Now, try to think clearly... don't you mean _Jason's_ hand... don't you mean he grabbed a scalpel and slashed Doctor Layton's throat?
RUBY: Did you find a scalpel? Did you find a murder weapon?
HARDING: Ruby, come on. You witnessed a brutal triple murder and you're having trouble accepting it. Think about what you're saying. You really expect a jury to believe that Jason has a mystery killer living in his tummy?
RUBY: I know how this sounds, but that's what happened.
