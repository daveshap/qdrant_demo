Can I transport bullet caps on a flight within the EU? I am traveling from Germany to Bulgaria over the upcoming holidays.Information:My uncle is a hunter and wants me to bring him some bullet caps that are not available in Bulgaria. I would transport them in my checked luggage.So overall there would be no black-powder or even shells; it would be just the bullet tips.Am I allowed to have the bullet tips in my luggage? Do I need to worry about being held up by either German or Bulgarian border-control/police?I do not possess a firearms licence and i have both German and Bulgarian citizenship if that should matter in any way.<br />Flying with Lufthansa directly to Sofia airport.
