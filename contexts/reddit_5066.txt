Can't get over being rejected for job?
I found out a few days ago that after 3 interview rounds I came in 2nd place for a job with over 200 applicants. It was absolutely a dream job and I nailed all three interviews so really thought I had it in the bag. All my friends and family also kept saying "oh I have a feeling you're going to get it" as well as my husband who said these things too. 

Long story short, after researching homes to rent/buy in the amazing new city for almost every day (2.5 weeks ago) since the first great interview, looking up the route to the new office from where we want to live, and envisioning my new life with this dream job, they offered it to someone else and I came in 2nd place. Now I'm back at the job I have now and I feel completely devastated and unmotivated since I don't like this job at all and find it boring and draining. I truly thought I would get the new job and be putting in a 2 weeks notice and now...nothing. 

I thought I was over it this weekend after having a good cry but being back at my job now with no end in sight is almost unbearable. How do I get over it and stop feeling very depressed about all this? I am worried an opportunity this good will not come up for us again, as that city is the only other  place where we can both do our jobs and not have to do 2 week rotations, so opportunities are few and far in between.  Thanks in advance!
