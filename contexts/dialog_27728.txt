FETTES: It was about last night I wanted to talk to you -- about the operation on the little Marsh girl.
MACFARLANE: You're a man of the world, Fettes, you wouldn't hold me to promise given in drink.
FETTES: But I -- well, you see, sir, I met Mrs. Marsh and told her.
MACFARLANE: Really, Fettes, you irk me with your lack of understanding.
FETTES: But you did promise.
MACFARLANE: Look here, Fettes. Not I nor anyone else knows enough about the spinal column and its intricacies to insure success in such an operation. I would have to study the matter. Have we any subjects"?"
FETTES: Wilmont used up the last spinal section.
MACFARLANE: You see, it is completely out of the question.
FETTES: Yes, I suppose so.
MACFARLANE: Now you run off and see that pretty Mrs. Marsh and explain to her.
