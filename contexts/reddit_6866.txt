Can I ask for pay stubs after I have been let go?
So I was temporarily laid off in March and now permanently laid off from my job due to low business relating to covid restriction. Till Dec 31st 2019 my former workplace was issuing paper and online pay stubs which showed how much I made in a 2 week period. From Jan 2020 they moved to an app to record clock in and clock out and all the pay information was on the app. When I was temporarily laid off in March, I was denied access to the app so I couldn't access pay information. Can I ask for the pay stubs which I am missing? Location:- BC, Canada
