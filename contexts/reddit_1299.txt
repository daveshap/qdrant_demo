Anxious when I’m not doing anything, but too anxious to start because there’s so much to do
I’ve have this problem for sooo long and it’s been holding me back for years. So I want to do a lot of creative things and get good at them. Like drawing, painting, dancing, clay jewelry, flow art, making clothes, custom dolls, music production and djing, and probably more. And I know all these things take time to get the hang of but.. I just don’t practice ANY of them, ever. I’ll wake up and tell myself I’ll practice one of them but get so overwhelmed because in the back of my mind I know there’s so many other things I want to do too. So I just don’t do any of it and waste my time while feeling guilty. It’s like I feel guilty even when I’m “about” to go do it because I know that I won’t get up.
