So thatâ€™s depressing about your dog dying hey? ðŸ™‚
I went on a date with my secret jr.high crush last week, we matched on tinder and then finally got to get together when some restaurants opened up again! 

then I proceeded to: 

-aggressively bring up the recent death of his dog 

-unintentionally call his Mother stupid
 
-awkwardly only eat 3 plain chips from a whole plate of guacamole & chips, out of sheer nervousness 

-rounded it off by confessing that iâ€™ve joined the military and could get kicked over to basic training when life returns to normal 

- also a plethora of random other things that quickly brought on awkward moments 

LOL then I called him after he dropped me off at my car & told him I was really sorry and not actually that weird and awkward, but that I was just really
nervous because Iâ€™d had an old crush on him- he laughed and assured me it was all good. 

aaaaaaaaand we have not talked since LOL
