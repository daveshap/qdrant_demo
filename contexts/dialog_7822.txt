HARRY: What? What did we do?
LLOYD: We never thanked him for giving us our Special Needs class.
HARRY: That's what Jessica was talking about!
LLOYD: She wants us to show the world what a great guy Principal Collins is.
HARRY: And like she said, do it before the parade.
LLOYD: A float!
HARRY: That's it. Build him a float for the Thanksgiving Day parade!
LLOYD: HARRY, we found the real thing to be thankful for. Screw George Washington!
HARRY: Yes. Screw George Washington. Just like Marilyn Monroe did.
HARRY: Ready Lloyd?
LLOYD: Put a fork in me Harry, lets get started.
