My reason for living is gone
My boyfriend killed himself while we were on vacation at his family’s lake house. He left us to find him with a belt around his neck. We tried CPR, I held his head while the medics worked on him. I can’t get it out of my head. I can’t be without him. I don’t know how to be by myself. I haven’t gone more than 2 days without seeing him in a year, and it’s been 3 since it happened. My whole family is worried about me and I don’t want to be selfish but I can’t see myself here in this planet without him. I don’t know what I believe in, I don’t know if he’s reincarnated or in the spirit world or in heaven but I need to know. I can’t do it right now. I have a wait a while. I can’t do that to our families. It’s my fault for not knowing he’d do this, his family didn’t even know he was depressed but I knew. And I never thought anything like this would happen. I need him back. I can’t go on anymore. There’s so much pain in my body. Every night when I lay down I feel the pressure around my neck and I just want it to end. I’m too scared to hang myself like that. I just want to slip away peacefully. I just want as many pills as I can take and go somewhere where my family won’t find me before the police. I’ll leave a note, unlike him. I’ll give people answers. He took all of my answers away from me. The only answer I have from him is to go with him. I don’t know why he’d do this to us. I feel him slipping away. He’s my soulmate. I don’t know what to do. I’m waiting for him to tell me if I should do it, but he’s not answering me. I don’t want to be here without him. I just can’t do it. I’m not strong enough without him.
