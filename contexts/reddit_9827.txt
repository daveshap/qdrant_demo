Student Activities Questions
Hey everyone, 

I have a few questions and hope this is a good place to get soem responses.  If there is a better subreddit please point me in that direction.

1.
I work at a small private institution as the Director of Student Activities.  Recently I have noticed an increase in overall apathy from the student body.  With a limited budget I try to bring in events that they couldn't otherwise do in our location and support the common interests most students have ( we are on the beach so I bring in rock walls, zip lines, etc but also cater to surf culture with beach parties, luaus, and free water sport equipment rentals)

Surprisingly attendance is highest at dances in our dinning hall and bingo nights.  I was wondering if anyone had had extremely successful events that were unique to your institution and had students wanting to see it again year after year?

2.
I see a lot of posts on here from Check Im Here, does anyone use that system?  What do you utilize on it the most?  Are there other systems like orgsync or campus labs that you would recommend for tracking attendance, surveying, and promoting events?

3.
Our Service Learning opportunities have been less utilized this semester compared to the past three years.  I am trying to find a balance between addressing social issues in our community and the "sexy" appeal that draws students in.  Any suggestions on service opportunities that work well at your institution or tips on revitalizing the marketing of these opportunities?

Thanks for reading through my random thoughts/frustrations about the current semester and for any words of wisdom you all could share.
