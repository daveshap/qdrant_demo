DAE's anxienty always make you assume that poeople are mad at you?
I came to my dorm today to find my roommate studying for his finals so we only greeted each other, I sat down and let him study. He didn't talk to me much either cus obviously, he was studying.

The whole time my conscious self knew that he's not talking to me because he's focused on whatever he was reading. My subconscious self tho, was yelling at me the whole time being like "He's pissed at you, you must have done something to upset him and he probably hates you for it!"

This happens more than I'm willing to admit. The fact that I'm completely socially incompetent and often misread social cues doesn't help at all. Anyone else like that?
