FLETCH: 'I've been so many places in my life and times. I've sung a lot of songs, I've made some bad rhymes...'
MRS. STANWYK: It's amazing.
FLETCH: 'I've acted out my life on stages, with ten thousand people watching...'
MRS. STANWYK: Your bone structure, shoulders, neck...
FLETCH: 'But we're alone now, and I'm singing this song for you.'
MRS. STANWYK: Just like Alan. It's freaky.
FLETCH: Can I ask you a question?
MRS. STANWYK: Depends on the question.
FLETCH: Are you still in love with Alan?
MRS. STANWYK: No. I mean, 'no you can't ask me that.' I mean, ask me something else.
FLETCH: Why'd you let me in?
MRS. STANWYK: Because I'm bored. Oh, that sounds terrible, doesn't it. I'm sorry. If it makes you feel any better, I also let you in because I'm hungry.
FLETCH: Thanks, I feel much better. Listen, if you're so bored, why didn't you go to Utah with Alan?
MRS. STANWYK: Utah is not exactly a cure for boredom.
FLETCH: Good point.
MRS. STANWYK: Oh, listen to me. I've never even been there and look what I say about it. Anyway, I know there'd be nothing for me to do. I don't even know anybody there.
FLETCH: What about his parents?
MRS. STANWYK: He never sees them and I never met them.
FLETCH: How come?
MRS. STANWYK: Yes?
MR. UNDERHILL: Mrs. Stanwyk, I hate to disturb you. Tom Underhill here... I'm a new member.
FLETCH: Thanks for the great time.
MRS. STANWYK: What is this?
FLETCH: Long story.
MR. UNDERHILL: Apparently, someone of your acquaintance has charged the most extraordinary lunch to my bill.
MRS. STANWYK: John!
MRS. STANWYK: You don't know the Underhills?
MR. UNDERHILL: I'd appreciate an opportunity to discuss this with you.
MRS. STANWYK: I just stepped out of the shower! Can you give me a minute?
MR. UNDERHILL: Of course.
