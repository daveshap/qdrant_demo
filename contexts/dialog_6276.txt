DMITRI: Tell me Vincent. Tell me what you think.
MAX: I think...
DMITRI: What?
MAX: I think... ...I think you should get this gun out of my fucking face.
DMITRI: What? What did you say?
MAX: I said. Get the gun. Out. Of my fucking <u>face.</u> Before I wrap it in a blintz and feed it to you.
MAX: I picked up a tail.
DMITRI: Federal?
MAX: You tell me. I had to toss the list in the river. I was protecting your sorry, long-winded ass. So why don't you show a little courtesy?
MAX: You think I wanted to come here tonight? You think I'm that stupid? Sometimes shit happens, you gotta roll with it.
DMITRI: Tell me. Has Black Peter already crossed off a few bad children?
MAX: The fat man on Cherry Street. The other fat man, Mr. Bulldozer. The trumpet player. That leaves two.
DMITRI: Can you finish on schedule?
MAX: In fifteen years, I have never left a customer unsatisfied.
PEDROSA: ...goddamn it, you telling me this motherfucker's whacked three of our witnesses tonight...
HELLER: ...Petrov and Cicerno for sure...
