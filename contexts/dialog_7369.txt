WADE: Yeah.
SANCHEZ: This should make your day. The guy who testified against you... Dubbs... was arrested a total number of twenty- four times.
WADE: So, he's got a thing for prison clothes.
SANCHEZ: That's just it. He never did time. Seems each arrest was botched for one reason or another. Judge threw out the cases each time. Either he's got a horseshoe up his ass or powerful friends.
WADE: You okay?
SANCHEZ: Aaah... Mother of Jesus.
WADE: What is it? Your legs? Hands?
SANCHEZ: Hospital food.
