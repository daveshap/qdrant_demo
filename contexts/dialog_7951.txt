SHARI: Are you sure about this?
ED: Hey, believe me -1 know I've got a great chance of making a fool of myself, here.
SHARI: Why do it?
ED: I saw this show once. It was about logging. I was home sick, there was nothing else on. Do you know how they break up really bad log jams? You know, when they're really tangled... ?
SHARI: Cream rinse?
ED: Dynamite.
SHARI: So?
ED: So maybe this is my dynamite.
SHARI: Dynamite is dangerous.
CYNTHIA: Ed, can I see you a second.
ED: Excuse me.
CYNTHIA: Okay, so you understand? We're installing a permanent camera in your bedroom, one in the kitchen, one in the living room, plus, of course, there'll always be a couple of steady-cams following you.
ED: Cool.
CYNTHIA: I want you to take this.
CYNTHIA: That has my work number, my home number, my pager number. I sleep three hours a night. Call me whenever you want to talk. Off the air, on the air, whenever. Okay?
ED: Um, yeah -- thanks.
CYNTHIA: Now look. Don't freeze up on me. I picked you because you had kind of a relaxed, go-with-the-flow quality. You're not going to lose that, are you?
ED: No, uh...
CYNTHIA: I bet my career on you. You'd better be good.
ED: Don't say that. That's like... telling a guy before you have sex you'd better be good. You don't do that.
CYNTHIA: I do.
