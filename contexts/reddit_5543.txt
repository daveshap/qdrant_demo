Warehouse Picking Strategies
Morning r/jobs, I’m a full time student and recently got hired for a part time job at a warehouse. I’ll be working in the grocery department and I’m going to be an assembler/picker (receive orders, get to the aisle, stack the orders on the pallet, wrap em up then continue to the next order). On average,  there are 1100 cases per 8 hour shift. Training/probation period is around 2 months, and by then we are required to hit a 95% efficiency. This is my first job, so I was wondering if anyone has advice for this kind of job. Any strategies or “tricks”? I’m a big guy, hopefully got the strength, and I’ve helped move furniture quite a few times so that may help a bit hopefully. Overall excited but also a bit nervous! If anyone’s got some advice to share please do! Thanks!
