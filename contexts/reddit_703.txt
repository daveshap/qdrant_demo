My girlfriend reminds me of my ex and I'm falling for a friend...
Well this happened in that last few weeks or so. My current girlfriend has started to show the same behavior my ex did (super possessive, trying to guilt trip you, controlling who you can hang out with, saying that she'll kill herself constantly and telling me that as long as I don't leave she'll remain alive) honestly I don't know what to do since I atributed everything to her depression , social anxiety and other mental illness (depression, social anxiety, abandonment issues). But recently I feel as if I've started avoiding her in order to hang out with a friend that I feel that I'm falling for and I think she likes me too. What should I do?
