JEANNE: What are you doing out here?
MAN: I might ask you the same question.
JEANNE: I... I'm leaving... I can't take anymore...
MAN: And what exactly is it that you can't take anymore of?
JEANNE: Everything! Prison -- humiliation -- being abandoned and betrayed by everyone -- I can't stand it anymore -- I'd rather die!
MAN: You'll be dead soon enough anyway, so why be in such a hurry? Why not face up to your lies? It's your lies you can't stand anymore...
JEANNE: I... I never lied!
MAN: If you were true to yourself... if your faith was firm, you wouldn't need to run away from yourself like this...
JEANNE: I am true -- to my Lord, the King of Heaven. He knows how much I love him -- that's all that matters to me...
MAN: How can you pretend that you love God when you're about to throw away the most precious thing he gave you? Life is a gift, you should know that by now Jeanne -- a gift from God. You know what He'd say to you, if He was here? What are you doing to me
