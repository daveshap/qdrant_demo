Does the thought of work make anyone anxious?
Something upsetting will happen at work and I’ll feel really anxious all night or weekend about it (then it ruins whatever nice thing I have going on). It could be an argument between a colleague and I (they have been rude to me, I defend myself and then bamb...anxiety on the rumours, perceptions and so on), work I don’t really understand and have to present (the fear of being caught out for not knowing and being grilled), and so on. 

I think it’s even worse because I’m only a few months into my job and know it’s not for me. I’m trying to be smart and wait for another role. It’s just makes me feel really awful if I’m honest. Any experience? It would be great to get some tips? 

And yes I am applying for a new job.
