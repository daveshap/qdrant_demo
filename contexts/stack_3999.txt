Removing noise with Variational Autoencoders I have one question that is related to variational autoencoders: can they be used as a denosing algorithm in the same way as standard denosing autoencoders?I generally see people removing the encoder part of the VAE and use the rest as a generator of data, but I was wondering if I could still use the encoder-decoder combination (trained with noisy examples in input and clean in output) to generate a denosing algorithm.One question that comes to my mind is if the stochasticity of the VAE would prevent me from building a good denoiser.
