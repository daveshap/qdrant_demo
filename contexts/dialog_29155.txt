SIDNEY: What do you mean, you'd rather die alone?
BOND: I didn't say when I want to die -
BOND: ... Yes???
SIDNEY: Before we go any further here, Mr. Bond, from Lloyds of London, I just want to get two things straight.
BOND: ... Yes?
SIDNEY: First, that boat is in international waters. I'm claiming it for salvage. One-third of that gold is mine.
BOND: And number two?
SIDNEY: If you think we're going to have some kind of 'life affirming' romance here just because we cheated death, let me be clear: We're going to have it where I want, and when I want.
BOND: And when might that be?
SIDNEY: Now.
