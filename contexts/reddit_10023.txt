Is it too late for me?
Hello all, I am a 27 year old undergrad finishing up my BA in English and have an Associates in Accounting. During my tenor in school I have been president of a 2 clubs(two diffrent schools), creator of another, member of SGA, worked on filming an oral history of the school with the head of the Anthropology department and in the last year have worked closely with the Director of Student Affairs. Through all this I have learned I found a certain joy in creating events  and programs to help unite the populace.

Despite my passion, my gpa is still rather weak (2.8 for my major). Is it too late for me to make a route towards working in student affairs after college? I am graduating soon and I cant imagine my life without the stress of juggling a bunch of various events with nothing in common and learning something new every day. Is there anything I can do to continue what I've been doing while at school? 

Thanks for reading this and I hope whoever reading will be able to give me some insight.
