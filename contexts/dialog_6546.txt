M.J.: Quinn will be here any minute. What are you going to say?
NIKKO: Christ. I didn't lock the fucking drawer! You spend twenty years thinking some perp's gonna whack you... you'll crash your car... but what happens is, you fuck yourself... You can't imagine how many times I saw you two... your head together, I wish him dead. Every time... Want to hear something weird? I feel like I'd give my life to bring him back.
M.J.: You're in terrible trouble, Nikko.
NIKKO: Who gives a fuck? In all the years I never seen you cry. You loved him.
