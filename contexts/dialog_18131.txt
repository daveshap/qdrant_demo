PHELPS: ..the next day I managed to drag myself to the safe house, must've just missed you..anyway, I checked our aliases.
ETHAN: - and picked us up in the States -
PHELPS: - but you left before I could get there and I could check just so many places..
ETHAN: Yeah, smaller countries don't computerize customs records -
PHELPS: - so I watched Europe. Once you showed up in England..it was easy.
ETHAN: You knew I liked the rentals at Liverpool Street.
PHELPS: Hey, I showed 'em to you!
ETHAN: I remember..
ETHAN: Jim, who do you think you're kidding? A doctor's gotta look at that. You can't sit up straight.
PHELPS: I can sit up straight. I just can't..sit up straight very well. It's not important! I saw who shot me. Ethan, I saw the mole. It was Kittridge. <i>Kittridge!</i>
ETHAN: Kitteridge. Oh my god! Kittridge is the mole?
PHELPS: Yeah.
ETHAN: How did Kittridge do it?..
