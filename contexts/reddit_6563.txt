If I get hired as an Admin. Assistant, how likely is it I'll be some boss' errand boy?
I've seen a few good companies posting for administrative assistants lately, and that type of work seems like it would be something I'm good at, and it would pay higher than my current job (by also 10k a year).

Although it's not what is expressed in the job post, my concern is that it'll end up being one of those jobs where I'm getting constant phone calls/emails from the boss asking me to do stupid crap like send his wife flowers, have his car cleaned, etc.

I'm perfectly content with answering the phone, emails, handling mailing, and various bits of paperwork.  Being like a manservant is something that makes me nervous of the position.
