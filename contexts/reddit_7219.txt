Should I attend an expensive training seminar on my company's dime if I've been casually looking for a new job?
My company is supportive of attending these types of things once or twice a year. I've had my eye on one for a little while that's a few thousand dollars. I'd love to go, but I've been casually looking for another job. I don't really know if I'd leave my current company, but I've had two phone screens recently and continue to apply for "dream opportunities." If my future at my current company is uncertain, should l avoid pursuing pricey learning opportunities like this on their tab?

Edit: thanks everyone for the great discussion and advice! A few answers to common questions:

1. I'm only on the hook for the cost of the program if it's for tuition reimbursement. This is not one of those programs, so it would be covered in full by the company with no repayment clause that I'm aware of.

2. This training will be very beneficial to my career development no matter where I end up in the future. It is not company- or industry-specific.

3. I have no plan or exit strategy at my current company, just throwing my resume out whenever I see a great opportunity. I am ready to leave if any of these opportunities materialize.
