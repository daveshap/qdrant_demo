Hi! I'm the new mod
Hi all! I'm rtmiu. I'll be taking over as mod for the time being.

Around two and a half years ago, Wulfy and I met and grew close. We were both in fairly dark places in our lives, but we helped each other through it. At some point during that, we thought that others might be helped by the same thing, so Wulfy made /r/depression_help. They looked after it too (even when it was empty), but as life went on and took over, we got preoccupied and eventually forgot. We're both sorry about that.

But the greatest thing about this place is that it managed to grow without us; even through your collective pain, stigma and struggles, you managed to make this community thrive and be there for each other. I thank you all and am inspired by your kindness and generosity. You embody the collective strength of the human spirit.

That said, this subreddit isn't without issues, or toxicity. As a mod I'll do my best to listen to everyone and keep out any hate or antagonism.  Feel free to tell me if anything is wrong, or right! I wish you all the best :)
