JUNO: Hi Dad.
MAC: Hey, big puffy version of Junebug. Where have you been?
JUNO: Dealing with stuff way beyond my maturity level. Where is everyone?
MAC: Bren took Liberty Bell to her tot ice skating class.
JUNO: Tot ice skating? Tots can't ice skate. Liberty Bell's still getting the hang of stairs.
MAC: No, but you know Bren. She dreams big.
JUNO: Yeah, she does.
MAC: You look a little morose, honey. What's eating you?
JUNO: I'm losing my faith in humanity.
MAC: Think you can narrow it down for me.
JUNO: I guess I wonder sometimes if people ever stay together for good.
MAC: You mean like couples?
JUNO: Yeah, like people in love.
MAC: Are you having boy trouble? I gotta be honest; I don't much approve of you dating in your condition, 'cause... well, that's kind of messed up.
JUNO: Dad, no!
MAC: Well, it's kind of skanky. Isn't that what you girls call it? Skanky? Skeevy?
JUNO: Please stop now.
MAC: Tore up from the floor up?
JUNO: Dad, it's not about that. I just need to know that it's possible for two people to stay happy together forever. Or at least for a few years.
MAC: It's not easy, that's for sure. Now, I may not have the best track record in the world, but I have been with your stepmother for ten years now, and I'm proud to say that we're very happy.
