Should a company's conference travel benefit cover all expenses?
My company gives us a benefit that for $Xk, we can go to any conference we want. Supposedly that includes the cost of attendance, airfare, and hotel. When I asked my manager if this also covers food and local travel to and from the conference, he said he thinks it is not included, that is our responsibility. That seems ridiculous to me that we can be sent to a conference but not allowed to expense food. 

I know typically when a company sends you on travel, everything must legally be covered by the company withing some reasonable limits they set. 

Does this fall under that requirement? Or is it different because it's presented as a benefit? Maybe it's more of a stipend, I don't know what they officially call it. Also is this $Xk taxable?
