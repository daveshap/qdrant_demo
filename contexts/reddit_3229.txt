What Are The Benefits of Salary vs Hourly?
I have two offers I'm considering for my first "real" job after college. One is hourly, the other salary, but they're very close in terms of compensation.

Can I get some advice on the advantages and disadvantages of both?

One of my main concerns is what happens when I'm out sick. If I'm salaried and get sick, can employers dock pay if I don't have sick time built up?
