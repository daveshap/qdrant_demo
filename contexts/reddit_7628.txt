Should I tell my PI my future career plan in Industry?
Hi. I don't really know whether I should tell my PI my potential future career plan in medicine formulation development. It might be a good thing for having the PI with me on the same page so she won't tend to train me to become a postdoc, but I don't want her to think I'm not interested in research at all and might be perfunctory for my work. My brother has a pharm company and we agreed that I can work for him at least. I'm not sure whether I should sync my plan with my PI.
