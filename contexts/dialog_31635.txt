SAM TANNICK: What do you have?
GIBBONS: Not a whole helluva lot. His final transmission was mangled. About something or someone called Ahab". Whatever it is
SAM TANNICK: He was the best there was. That makes three agents lost.
GIBBONS: They're ruthless and they have a lot of firepower. It's only a matter of time before they figure out how to deploy Silent Night. Then we're gonna have a catastrophe on our hands.
SAM TANNICK: Silent Night in the hands of a bunch of impertinent cowboys
GIBBONS: We're gonna have to step in, Sam. Those CIA boys couldn't find a clown in a field of cactus. Let me take care of it.
SAM TANNICK: How will you fix it?
GIBBONS: I'll go in with a team. But first I'm going to need some intel. I'll have to put someone inside, someone new, someone they won't see coming. One of their own.
SAM TANNICK: So you'll dredge the bottom again. You've done that before. The results were... uneven.
GIBBONS: You wanna find out about rats, ask a rat. I've had my people put together a talent pool. I downloaded it to your desktop.
GIBBONS: The usual prospects. Convicts, contract killers, murde...
SAM TANNICK: The scum of the Earth.
GIBBONS: But programmable. And expendable.
SAM TANNICK: I've seen enough. Turn it off.
SAM TANNICK: They're degenerates. There's not a man in there that would give a damn if the Chinese took over.
GIBBONS: That's exactly why we need them.
