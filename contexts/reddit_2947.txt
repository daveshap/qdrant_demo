Current Employer was contacted by a possible employer. How to proceed?
So I cam currently in the job market and have applied and interviewed for a position. On their application it asks for employment history and if they may contact that employer. So I filled out the application and said no they can not contact my current employer but they may contact my previous employer. Well they contacted my current employer to my surprise. I had a meeting with my manger, HR and the president of the company discussing why I was looking to leave and stuff like that. I had thought that this was very unprofessional as it felt confrontational in the meeting, but now the reason I am writing this is now I am in a strange position at work. I have not received an offer letter from that company yet so that has me a bit unease at work. But my question is what do you think I should do? Is there anything i could do if they fire me? I don't think they will fire me as that would just open them up to a lawsuit.. I think. But is there anything I could do in regards to the possible employer if I do not get the position? Basically wtf should I do besides keep looking for a new job? Thanks
