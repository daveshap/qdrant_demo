I asked for a different lid today
Today I went to Starbucks, ordered my drink and with little hesitation asked for one of the lids without a straw. Now to some this may seem like an everyday thing but for me this was a big step. After that I went to my first ever lash lift appointment. I was so unbelievably excited to treat myself to this. I laid down, closed my eyes and the woman began my treatment. I knew from the beginning I had to keep my eyes closed for a good hour and a half but, I had no idea how I would react. Once she had the perm solution on and she took her hands away from my eyes to let it sit it all sank in. I immediately started to feel dizzy and like I needed to open my eyes IMMEDIATELY. Now, a few years ago I would have just sat there through my anxiety attack and just dealt with it because I didn’t want to bother her. Today, I very politely explained to her that I needed to have it taken off and I would still pay her for the service. She was so kind and understanding that she didn’t charge me for anything and told me I could always come back and try again another day. Again, to some people this would sound like a failure. I failed to complete the treatment and I felt so overwhelmed, embarrassed, and upset. But, I asked for a different lid today. And that’s a win in my book.
