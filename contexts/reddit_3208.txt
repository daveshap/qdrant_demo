Can't Do Business Professional Dress for Interview -> Automatic Disqualification?
So I was contacted this morning to set up a meeting with the hiring manager of a local marketing consulting firm to discuss an entry level position. In a confirmation email, they asked that I come dressed business professional, which I take to mean a suit. The problem is that I don't own one. Since the interview is tomorrow at 9:45 am and my current job is second shift, I will have no time to get one. The firm is also a 90 minute drive for me, so I won't have time to grab anything tomorrow morning. 

So I guess I have two options. 1) Go as is and hope for the best or 2) ask to reschedule the interview ASAP to give me time to find something. I'm 29 and have never worked in marketing. I can do the nice end of business casual. What should I do? Would they disqualify me based on this?
