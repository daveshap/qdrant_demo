SANCHEZ: NPA metamorphosis should biologically slow him down. That's when we'll get him.
WADE: You can't catch this man with a computer.
SANCHEZ: How then?
WADE: You don't follow the bodies, and you don't follow procedure. You do it by instinct. Think like him. Do what has to be dane.
SANCHEZ: Sir, I took the liberty of running a GCI scenario on a TM-1 earlier today...
WADE: GCI. TM-1. What language are you talking?
SANCHEZ: I also PVC'd you. Youngest Officer promoted to Sergeant. Two CMs. Four honor medals...
WADE: Drop it.
SANCHEZ: Why?
WADE: I was set up.
SANCHEZ: You're saying you were put away for a crime you didn't commit?
WADE: 'Bout the same time I busted Doucet I tried to nail this big-time dealer. I didn't have an ID, but I was close. Too close. Gained the confidence of a badass named Dubbs. He was going to turn me onto the big man. He made me for a cop. Mysteriously my fellow officers discovered ten pounds of heroin in my cruiser.
SANCHEZ: It doesn't make sense. Who would want to do that to you?
WADE: Nothing makes sense when you're a cop.
WADE: Married?
SANCHEZ: Engaged. Plan on doing it this summer. You still married?
WADE: Yeah. Least I think so. Twenty- six years this March.
