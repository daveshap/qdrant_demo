8th grade predictions come true
So in 8th grade my English teacher made use write letters to our future senior selves, and I recently received mine! Part of the assignment was to list predictions for the future, including where you think you’re going to college. I had completely forgotten what I had written 4 years ago, but I was so surprised to see how accurate it was. My friends and I got kick out of reading it. 

My 8th grade self claimed, with a decent amount of certainty, that I would either be going to Cornell or Yale, two schools that were arbitrarily picked because they sounded cool. I am now extremely excited to say that I have been accepted to Yale! It’s crazy to think that my extremely overconfident “prediction,” more like crapshot, actually came true. 

I thought that you guys would enjoy this wack story
