Short-story about a post-apocalyptic future that is only revealed at the end I read a short story in a high-school literature book circa 2004 that revolved around a young protagonist (I think female) who had to make a journey down a river in what originally seemed to be a primitive civilization. As the story progresses, it is revealed that it is actually far in the future after the world has been destroyed.I really enjoyed the story, and would love to know more about it, especially the title, and or author.
