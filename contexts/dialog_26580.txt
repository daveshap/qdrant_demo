DYLAN: Dylan here.
MACKELWAY: Sheriff Dylan, this is FBI Agent Thomas Mackelway. Remember me?
DYLAN: Hi there.
MACKELWAY: I want to talk about the Karen Sumpter case.
DYLAN: You heard?
MACKELWAY: What?
DYLAN: Her body turned up. In a Minnesota cemetery. They brought her back.
MACKELWAY: You have the body?
DYLAN: She's buried.
MACKELWAY: I want the autopsy report, where is it, Minnesota?
DYLAN: Winona.
KULOK: This feels like something out of a spy novel.
MACKELWAY: I guess I'm a little paranoid.
KULOK: What's going on?
MACKELWAY: I met with Richard Low. These are names of missing persons he has flagged. I'm double-checking every case, but I don't want to be too obvious about it. I marked the ones I'd like you to work on.
KULOK: Slow down a second, you met with Low --
MACKELWAY: You were right. He found me.
KULOK: And you're working with him?
MACKELWAY: I need something tangible. To hook him. I told him I'd found the confidential file on the Suspect Zero theory.
KULOK: Does one exist?
MACKELWAY: Probably. I told him Koessler had ordered the report, kept it secret.
KULOK: Koessler doesn't know any of this?
MACKELWAY: I've decided to investigate Low's plane crash. While I'm at it, I thought I'd look at the cases Koessler worked with Low.
KULOK: I'd be real careful if I were you.
MACKELWAY: It's too late for that. I've gone ahead of the curve on this one. There's no turning back. When this is over, Koessler is going to be right or Low is going to be right or I'm going to be right, but not all of us.
KULOK: It's okay to be wrong, just don't be dead wrong.
MACKELWAY: They say Richard Low is wrong, but because of him, women, innocent women, are alive who would be dead.
KULOK: You're putting me in a difficult position.
MACKELWAY: I got an autopsy report from El Paso that doesn't seem right. A girl on Low's list. Karen Sumpter. We're getting a court order to exhume to body. I'd like you to come and look at it. Don't worry, I've cleared it.
MACKELWAY: Jaime, do you think, when this is all over, when we're in different divisions, you think maybe you and me, we could try again?
KULOK: Mack, I'm just trying to keep up with now.
