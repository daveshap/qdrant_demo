LinkedIn summary: Help me word it to let recruiters know I’m interested without my boss seeing?
Hi all, I’m revamping my LinkedIn and would like to say something along the lines of “open to new opportunities” without actually saying that. My current boss is connected with me and I will not chance losing my current job but would like recruiters to know I’m interested. Anyone got any ideas? Thanks in advance
