Former career coach just sent out an promotional email blast using my name, image, and personal struggles with my employer/job and my boss just forwarded it to me and wants to meet. What should I say to him and what should I do next?
To be honest I don’t even know what advice I’m looking for. Just totally freaked out and appalled by the breach of trust.

I worked with this career coach for 3 months and paid quite a bit of money. She regularly sends out emails with ‘client success’ stories and I always assumed they were vetted by former members of her program.

Well without notice she just sent out mine. In Oct I moved departments within the same company because I had been miserable and overworked in my old role. Her public email included a bunch of what I had told her about how many hours I had been working overtime, how I was upset by management, and my desires to move back to my home city.

Well her advertising email was also sent to my skip level. He forwarded it to me for an explanation...I’m currently playing damage control and just generally fucked....Not sure what to say to him or other members of my team in explanation. Also need to figure out how to get the career coach to fix this. Is it worse if I ask them to send a public retraction?
