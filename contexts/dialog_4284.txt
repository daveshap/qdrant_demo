DULANEY: Your Honor, I don't see a Mr. Roston listed as a prosecution witness.
CARDENAS: The State's investigation just uncovered Mr. Roston yesterday afternoon in Chicago.
CARDENAS: Your Honor, Mr. Roston is an ex-lover of Miss Lawson's.
JUDGE BURNHAM: Why didn't the State's investigation uncover Mr. Roston earlier?
CARDENAS: He was away on an extended vacation and just returned two days ago.
JUDGE BURNHAM: Alright -- I'm going to allow his testimony.
DULANEY: But Your Honor--
JUDGE BURNHAM: That's it, Mr. Dulaney. Take a seat.
CARDENAS: Mr. Roston, what was your relationship with Miss Lawson?
ROSTON: We were lovers.
CARDENAS: How long were you together?
ROSTON: For about one year.
CARDENAS: How would you describe your sex life with Miss Lawson?
ROSTON: Intense.
CARDENAS: I know this is a very personal subject, but could you be a little more specific?
ROSTON: It was wild. She was constantly trying to get me more and more worked up -- kinky things. I tried to satisfy her the best I could, but it was difficult in my condition.
CARDENAS: What kind of condition are you referring to?
ROSTON: I had a bad heart.
CARDENAS: What happened next?
ROSTON: I had bypass surgery.
CARDENAS: And how are you now?
ROSTON: Fine. The doctors say if I keep taking care of myself I can live to be a very old man.
CARDENAS: How did your relationship with Miss Lawson progress after the surgery?
ROSTON: It didn't.
CARDENAS: Why not?
ROSTON: She left me.
CARDENAS: Why did she say she was leaving?
ROSTON: She didn't. She just left.
CARDENAS: Why do you think she left you?
ROSTON: Well -- I think that after the operation she realized that...
DULANEY: Objection. The question calls for a conclusion on the part of the witness.
CARDENAS: Your Honor, Mr. Roston lived with the defendant for many months. I feel that his opinion is valid in substantiating the character of the Miss Lawson.
DULANEY: The opinion of a scorned lover is hardly an objective view.
JUDGE BURNHAM: Objection sustained.
CARDENAS: Did Miss Lawson ever give you any indication why she was leaving?
DULANEY: Objection. The witness has already stated that Miss Lawson left without an explanation.
JUDGE BURNHAM: Mr. Cardenas, I suggest you move on to another line of questioning.
CARDENAS: When you say your sexual relations with Miss Lawson were intense what exactly do you mean?
ROSTON: It was like she was trying to push me as far as she could. She called it opening new doors.
CARDENAS: Can you give the court an example?
ROSTON: It was like sex was a game to her. She got off on the control. She always used to tell me it had to be her way.
ROSTON: It's hard to resist a woman as beautiful as she is.
CARDENAS: What would she do that made it hard to resist?
ROSTON: She's a woman who is very much aware of her own sexuality. Sometimes I felt she could read my mind. It was uncanny how she knew exactly what I wanted. A few nights before my heart surgery Rebecca woke me. She had handcuffed me to the bed.
ROSTON: She told me that tonight we were going to open new doors. I asked her to stop -- to take off the handcuffs, but she wouldn't listen.
CARDENAS: What did she say?
CARDENAS: Mr. Roston I know this is difficult for you, but it's important you tell the court what she did.
ROSTON: She said she was going to fuck me like I've never been fucked before.
