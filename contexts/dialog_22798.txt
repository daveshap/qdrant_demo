ESPERANZA: Where are you going?
RAMÓN: Hunting.
ESPERANZA: When?
RAMÓN: Sun up.
ESPERANZA: Alone?
RAMÓN: No.
ESPERANZA: Ramón -- you can't.
RAMÓN: Why not? I'm not needed here.
ESPERANZA: But you are needed. Especially now -- with most of the other men away. You're captain of the stand-by squad.
RAMÓN: Sure, the standby squad. Stand-by for the funeral.
ESPERANZA: Whose funeral? We're doing all right. There hasn't been a scab near the picket line for three days.
RAMÓN: And you know why? Because the company knows they can starve us out -- even if it takes another two, three months. What's it to them if the mine's shut down a little longer?
ESPERANZA: It's a lot to them. They'd do anything to open that mine.
RAMÓN: Aah! They've got other mines. You don't see the larger picture. They've got millions. Millions. They can outlast us, and they know it.
ESPERANZA: You mean you're ready to give up?
RAMÓN: Who said anything about giving up? I'll never go back to the company on my knees. Never.
