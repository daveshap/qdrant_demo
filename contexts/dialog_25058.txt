HOFFY: Sergeant Hoffman from Barrack 4.
VON SCHERBACH: Yes, Sergeant Hoffman?
HOFFY: As the duly elected Compound Chief, I protest the way these bodies are left lying in the mud.
VON SCHERBACH: Anything else?
HOFFY: Yes. According to the Geneva Convention, dead prisoners are to be given a decent burial.
VON SCHERBACH: Of course. I'm aware of the Geneva Convention. They will be given the burial they deserve. Or perhaps you would suggest we haul in twenty-one cannons from the Eastern Front and give them a twenty-one gun salute?
