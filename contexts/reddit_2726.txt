Been working in the videogame industry for 10 years. I'm 30 years old and I am now sick and tired of it. How do I get out? What non-gaming, possibly non-programming, jobs can I get into?
I'm a 30 years old male from Europe. I've been working as a videogame programmer in the last 10 years. I've started out as a junior, then I moved to senior, then I moved to lead programmer. I've changed 4 companies in total, and I've worked on mobile, on PC/Mac and on Console games.

I'm now completely sick and tired of it. I don't like the direction in which the game industry is going. I don't like most of the modern games. I dislike the "gamer community" (whatever that means), and I absolutely despise the "gamedev community". Especially indie developers: can't stand being around them anymore. But also AAA developers are insufferable. I've worked in 3 different European countries and the situation is the same. On top of that, add the fact that I'm having your typical 30-year-old crisis in which I feel like I'm doing nothing meaningful for humanity and for the world.

I do enjoy programming, but I'd rather have a managerial job, in which I send emails, file spreadsheets and run meetings all day. I'd especially enjoy the idea to work in politics-related fields, but I wouldn't know where to start, and I only know people in the game industry. I don't even know how hard it is to land a politic-related job. Is it a pipe-dream hob, or is it doable?

I feel like I'm pretty flexible and open to anything, as long as it has a good salary **or** good growth possibilities. What other fields should I look into?

**Please keep in mind that I have no college degree, and don't have the money/time to take one.** Also, I'm ok with relocating anywhere in the world with short notice.

Please help.
