VINCENT: Alright, it's done.
SAM: You see the bullet?
VINCENT: Clearly.
SAM: Good. Now take the forceps, and remember, Vincent, what we're doing here is routine. I've done stuff like this at least twenty times in the field. There are no vital organs where you're working, no major muscles or arteries -- you can't kill me. Just make sure you've got the bullet before you try to pull it out.
