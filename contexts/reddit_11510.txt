Nitpicky English professor and teenagers at work
I had a hard time sleeping last night, i have a lot in my mind and it's driving me a little crazy. I just returned to school this semester after not going for 13 years (I'm 32) and i I've always done good with English and the grade i got on my first paper isn't bad at all (B+). It's just that, when i went to read her feedback i was expecting something that would explain what i did wrong and how to to fix it. Instead, i got a rubrick chart showing how she marked my paper that basically showed she was contradicting what she told our class. 

Since it was our first paper she didn't tell us anything about MLA format or citing and said she wasn't grading for that , i ended up looking it up and kind've guessing at it when i typed my paper. I also thoroughly checked for grammar and punctuation. What does she do? She takes points off for both and for grammar /punctuation. I worked really hard on that paper and she takes points for the thing she wasn't going to because she hadn't gone over it. I was really hoping for her to point out what was wrong with it so i could fix it and make the next paper better. I can't write better papers if i don't know what I'm doing wrong.

Then, at work i'm the secretary but i act as the 3rd manager when the other two have left for the day (i do this twice a week). There's two teenagers i have the worst time with. Anytime i tell them to do something they act like It's a suggestion. I don't want to get hateful with them but i feel like i might have to if they won't listen to me.
