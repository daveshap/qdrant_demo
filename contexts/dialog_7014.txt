DOOLITTLE: Well... now what? What do, you have for us now. Boiler?
BOILER: Not much. Nothing at all in this sector.
DOOLITTLE: Find me something, I don't care where it is.
BOILER: Well, I show a 95% probability of sentient life in the Horsehead Nebula...
DOOLITTLE: Fuck that shit.
BOILER: Well, it is kind of a long shot...
DOOLITTLE: It's a goddamn wild goose chase. Remember when Commander Powell found that 99 plus probability of sentient life in the Magellanic Cloud?
BOILER: Well, there's the possibility of...
DOOLITTLE: Remember what we found? Fourteen light years for a fucking mindless vegetable that looked like a limp balloon and went squawk and let a fart when you touched it. Remember?
BOILER: All right, then...
DOOLITTLE: So don't give me any of that sentient life crap. Find me something I can blow up.
PINBACK: New star. Hey, guess what? I got a new star on the readout.
DOOLITTLE: Which one?
PINBACK: Another unknown. Not on the charts. A red dwarf.
DOOLITTLE: Any planets?
PINBACK: Yeah. Eight, it says here.
DOOLITTLE: Any of 'em any good?
PINBACK: Naah. All stable.
PINBACK: What are you gonna name it?
DOOLITTLE: What?
PINBACK: The new star. What are you gonna name it?
DOOLITTLE: Who cares. Don't bother me.
PINBACK: Commander Powell would have named it.
DOOLITTLE: Commander Powell is dead.
PINBACK: Come on, Doolittle, give it a name.
DOOLITTLE: Fred.
PINBACK: Wha?
DOOLITTLE: I hereby name this star Fred.
BOILER: Hey, Doolittle, here's one. An unstable planet. 85% probability of an unstable planet in the Veil Nebula that will probably go off its orbit and hit a star.
DOOLITTLE: Sounds good. Chart a course for the Veil Nebula.
BOILER: Pinback, throw me the chart log.
