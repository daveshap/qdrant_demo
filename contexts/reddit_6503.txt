No diversity in workplace?
I’m south Asian. I live in the south. Maybe it’s just the companies I work at but I’ve noticed that there are rarely any Asians or south Asians where I am. If there are it’s few in between. Also there’s barely any Hispanics in corporate jobs either. 

I’m wondering if this is a Georgia thing or If it’s common everywhere
