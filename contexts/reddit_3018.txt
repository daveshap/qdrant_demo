28. Just finished xray tech degree. Not in love with it. Regretting it. Where do I go from here?
Chose this field cause i enjoyed anatomy classes , but more so because i felt i was running out of time.  Its a minor pay raise compared to my current delivery job and much more stressful. All of a sudden i just don't want to be a slave employee anymore.  

I'm having business-type thoughts such as how i can make money while sleeping, investing, etc; even though i have no experience in this field.  I feel like i wasted my 20s figuring out how to make money without school, was unsuccessful so i caved and chose xray, and now my mentality is back to ground zero.  My girlfriend is an office manager and bartender and each of those match what i will make as an xray tech, and that frustrates me.

Do i uber just to network and meet people? Do i start streaming on twitch? My mind is all over the place. If i pursue an advanced modality beyond xray i'll make a few more bucks but most likely still be unhappy.
