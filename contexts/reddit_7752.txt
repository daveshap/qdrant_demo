First project after grad school
Hello r/GradSchool
I'm a recent grad with a Master of Marketing Research and I'v been given my first project to construct a plan to build a resource for graduate students. I work with an executive research firm in NYC and I would love your insights as I have been lurking here for awhile.

The company I work with is called Options Group (an executive recruiting firm in the finance industry) and the project is aimed at giving graduate students, either still pursuing a degree or completed, resources to make the best career choices. Resources such as:

- career opportunities (jobs openings, internships, consulting opportunities)

- interview behaviour guidance

- resume tailoring

- prospective company culture, history, future

- staying on top of market trends and company events

- prospective job market skills and resources to learn

- events and opportunities to gain an advantage in the finance job market

- possibly distributed with a website portal and/or app

To test how we could best deliver these resources, we have created a survey. We would greatly appreciate your insight and thoughts and with 17 questions it should take no more than ~4 minutes.
