MAN: Let all who love me follow me"... Where does God get mentioned? Come on Jeanne
JEANNE: I... I was defending myself as best I could! Everyone has the right to defend themselves, don't they? Or should I have let myself be killed?
MAN: No, no, you did fine. I'd even say well done. Besides, most of the ones you killed probably deserved it, don't you think?
JEANNE: No, I do not think so. I don't think that killing each other will ever bring peace.
MAN: I agree...
