It feels silly to celebrate; but I got out of bed, showered, and dressed before the sun went down today! ðŸ˜Š
I stopped taking my meds last week (adderall) because my tolerance grew and I donâ€™t want to up my dosage. 

Ever since, Iâ€™ve been experiencing the worst depression Iâ€™ve had in forever. The rollercoaster Iâ€™ve been riding for the last week brought me to the point of wanting to just end it all a few nights ago. 

I was feeling really guilty this morning for what I have been putting my loved ones through. I almost fell back to where I was a couple of nights ago. But instead, I got out of bed, and just took a shower. Now Iâ€™m laying in my moms bed. I havenâ€™t said anything to her. But Iâ€™m feeling a lot better now. And I was able to avoid the longing to end my life.  

Thank you all for your posts in this sub. I stumbled on it this morning and it motivated me enough to get me out of bed. I didnâ€™t even have the strength to move before. 

Iâ€™m so happy that I wanted to share my excitement with someone. But no one else would understand how something so small could mean so much to someone like me. Thank you again!
