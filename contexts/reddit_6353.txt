After 7 months of unemployment, I've finally been offered a job! Here's how I got it...
Unemployed for 7 months, applied for anything and everything I thought I was remotely qualified for. For the first few months I got absolutely no response from anyone, then I saw a career counselor who helped me do a total revamp of my resume. Since December I've gotten 7 interviews, with the one I had last week finally panning out. And what was different about it? I knew the person who interviewed me. 

I desperately wanted the "you'll only get a job through networking" people to be wrong. But after what just happened, I'm pretty sure they're not. I'm sorry for everyone who has to deal with this crappy economy and the ridiculous bullshit hoops companies make you jump through. I sincerely hope all of you get jobs tomorrow! And although I want to punch myself in the face when I say this, all I can tell you to do is network. The connection I had is my cousin's husband's sister. Hit up EVERYONE you know, because someone out there is bound to work for somebody that's hiring. Good luck to all of you!
