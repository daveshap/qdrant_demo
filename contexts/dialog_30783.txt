MRS. FRANK: Just plain old coffee. None of that mocha nonsense.
CLAIRE: It's fine.
MRS. FRANK: You look a little old for a student.
CLAIRE: I'm not. We...we met at a party.
MRS. FRANK: Sounds about right. Never understood how a girl that wild got all A's. Sure didn't get it from me. They wanted to put her in a special school for the gifted when she was young. Maddie wouldn't hear about it.
CLAIRE: She never mentioned her father.
MRS. FRANK: Well she wouldn't. He left when she was twelve. Never spoke about him after that.
