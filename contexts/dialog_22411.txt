MARY: Aspen doesn't want us Mr. Graham. They threw us out.
GRAHAM: They shouldn't have done that.
MARY: We tried to point that out. But there were some pretty nosey citizens who wouldn't listen to reason. They said Aspen had outgrown us. It's all right to play poker in your own home but not in a saloon.
GRAHAM: I knew something would happen when they started puttin' up fences and passin' laws.
MARY: Goodbye and thanks.
GRAHAM: I don't like to see you go.
