Why does every Virginia governor issue an executive order banning forms of discrimination that are already illegal under both federal and state law?
Every governor of Virginia since Linwood Holton has signed an executive order banning the state workforce from engaging in racial, religious, or sex-based discrimination.[[1]](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/31/AR2010013102083_2.html?sid=ST2010020803832) Recent governors have expanded these executive orders to include further protections, some of which are not currently covered by federal or state law, such as protections on the basis of sexual orientation and on the basis of gender identity.[[1]](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/31/AR2010013102083_2.html?sid=ST2010020803832)[[2]](

I'm not familiar with how to read legal documents, but if I'm understanding [this page](https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodepopularnames/virginia-human-rights-act/) correctly, it seems that Virginia may not have had any anti-discrimination laws until the 1980s. Holton took office in 1970, and so considering Virginia's history of racial discrimination, Holton's executive order likely made an impact, even though racial discrimination was already illegal under federal law at the time. 

But as that Virginia.gov page I just linked to clearly shows, in the time since Holton's governorship, Virginia has passed a state law banning racial, religious, and gender-based discrimination. So it's unclear to me why these protections are still included in executive orders. The protection against anti-LGBT discrimination still serves a clear legal purpose. But why does the governor still have to issue an executive order banning, say, racial discrimination, if racial discrimination is illegal under both federal and state law? Is this done solely for symbolic purposes? Or does it have any practical impact? 

Making matter even more confusing, the Virginia legislature has recently attempted, unsuccessfully, to codify these executive orders into state law.[[4]](https://www.wvtf.org/post/tie-breaking-vote-sends-employment-discrimination-bill-forward#stream/0)[[5]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/va-house-panel-kills-bills-to-ban-anti-lgbt-discrimination-in-housing-and-jobs/2018/02/08/17051270-0d15-11e8-8b0d-891602206fb7_story.html?utm_term=.cc3b3bd8324d) Most of the news coverage about this has focused on the fact that such legislation, if passed, would ban LGBT discrimination in Virginia. But a few of the news articles that I've seen, such as this one [[6]](https://www.wvtf.org/post/tie-breaking-vote-sends-employment-discrimination-bill-forward#stream/0), explicitly state that the proposed legislation would codify all of the protections that have been offered under these executive orders, including those protections that are *already* codified as part of existing  state law. 

So as with the executive orders, I can see why the anti-LGBT discrimination portion of this proposed legislation would serve a purpose. But the parts of this legislation having to do with racial discrimination, religious discrimination, etc. seem to be redundant to existing state law.

It seems like the legislature could propose a law simply banning LGBT discrimination, rather than proposing a law that would ban, in addition to LGBT discrimination, a bunch of things that have already been banned in Virginia. 

I know that this is a really specific, wonky question, and so I'm not sure that anyone will be able to answer it. But does anyone know why -

1. Virginia governors continue to issue executive orders banning things that are already illegal under both federal and state law, instead of issuing executive orders that are solely focused on banning anti-LGBT discrimination? 

2. the Virginia legislature has proposed legislation that would ban things already illegal under both federal and state law, instead of proposing legislation that would solely focus on banning anti-LGBT discrimination? 

Is there some very subtle thing that I'm not understanding here? Or like I suggested earlier, is this simply being done for symbolic purposes? 

Thanks!
