How many of you guys actually like black women?
Dating sucks as a black woman because most people don't prefer black woman unless it is sex related with no strings attached. We are viewed as ugly, too dark, our hair is quote on quote too nappy and ugly and we are mostly seen as ratchet. I cant get attention from men unless it is writing or sex related. I hate my life, i'm tired of being single.....
