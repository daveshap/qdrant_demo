COLONEL: The elevators are still runnin'.
MIKE: I know one way you can do it.
JOHN: How?
MIKE: Well, when you get up on the radio, all you have to do is say the whole thing's a frame-up. Make you a hero sure as you're born!
JOHN: Yeah, but how am I gonna get my arm fixed?
MIKE: Well, that's a cinch. I know somebody that'll give you five thousand dollars just to get up on the radio and tell the truth.
