Subconscious vs Unconscious in The Big Bang Theory Series The Big Bang Theory season 11, episode 15:Leonard: \"I didn't intend to write about Penny ... maybe subconsciously I did.\"Leonard's mother: \"I believe you mean unconsciously dear.\"I have read here on SE and other sites that subconscious is the proper word to use and unconscious means you're passed out and not in your senses.Have I been mistaken all this time?
