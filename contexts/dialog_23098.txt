BILLY: FIND HER YOU DIPSHIT!
STU: I can't... I'm bad off, Billy. You cut too deep.
SIDNEY: So Stu, what's your motive? Billy's got one. The police are on their way. What are you going to tell them?
STU: Peer pressure... I'm way to sensitive.
BILLY: I'm gonna rip you up bitch. Just like your slut whore mother.
SIDNEY: Gotta find me first, you pansy-assed Mama's boy.
