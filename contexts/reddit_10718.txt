Does anyone else love sleeping because you get either dreams or a sense of nothingness, both of which feel better than being awake?
I sleep a lot. As much as I can.

Feels good to fade away and stop existing for a while.

When I have dreams I dream I’m a normal, happy person. I dreamed recently this girl I used to know was my girlfriend. She was having dinner at my place with my family. My parents looked so proud.

If I don’t dream, the sense of oblivion is great too. 

Maybe that’s why I want to die so bad. It’s basically just sleeping forever.
