HEATHER DUKE: Veronica! Color me stoked, girl. I've gotten <u>everyone</u> to sign this petition even the one who think BigFun are tuneless Eurofags. People love me! My God, you haven't signed!

VERONICA: Don't talk to me like that.

VERONICA: No.
HEATHER DUKE: Jealous much?
VERONICA: Heather, why can't you just be a friend? Why are you such a MegaBitch?
HEATHER DUKE: Because I can be! The same fucking cheek, goddamnit! Why are you pulling my dick? Do you think, do you really think, if Betty Finn's fairy godmother made <u>her</u> Cool, she'd still act nice and hang with her dweebette friends? No way! Uh-Uh!
