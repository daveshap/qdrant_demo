JUDGE: Rose?
ROSE: Yeah... Look man, what I gotta say. It's just you, me and the rats, right? Alright... well... Sabu's back.
JUDGE: Motherfuck... well then I got something to do.
ROSE: No... wait, there's something else, something weird. I hear he's set up down at that warehouse on fifty deuce. He's talking big and living bigger.
JUDGE: God damn it's him. I gotta go.
ROSE: Judge man. Watch yourself. Sabu's got juice now.
JUDGE: You don't even know it man, but you're a god damn hero.
