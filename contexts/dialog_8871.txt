FRANK: You know, my brother and I have been playing together, gosh, I don't know. How long has it been, Jack?
JACK: Twenty-eight years, Frank.
FRANK: That's a lot of water under the bridge, eh, Jack?
JACK: Lotta water.
FRANK: Of course, back then, things were a little different. I was eight, Jack was seven, just about the only song we knew was 'My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean', and the only one who would listen to us was the family cat, Cecil. We must have shaved three lives off that cat, eh, Jack?
