As of this morning I have officially paid off 100% of my credit card debt!
I have been eagerly awaiting to make this post for months now. As of March 2018 my credit card debt was at an all time high of $2700 and I felt so ashamed of it. Between March 1st and today, July 16th, I have paid it all off!  

I got a much higher paying job that started March 1st and have been dumping as much of each of my checks into my credit card balance as I possibly could. For reference - my last check was about $1200 and I put like $719 towards paying off my card. I would be happy to go in more detail about the payments I made if anyone is interested. 

I am even more proud to say that I did this all while not missing any payments on my other bills. I am pregnant with my first child that is due in October and I was SO determined to have this eliminated before the baby arrives. Now until I go on maternity leave I can create some savings and breathe a bit more. 

I have learned my lesson and will never let this happen again! It was a bad combo of a few big bills piling up on each other close together and staying too long at a job I really enjoyed - but didn’t pay enough. Lesson definitely learned! 

Now my only existing debt are my student loans (which I’ve never missed a payment on), all my bills are paid, I have groceries and life is good!
