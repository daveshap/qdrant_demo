i'm no longer romantic
hello everyone, this is my first time posting here, i hope everyone is safe and doing good!  
so as you read in the title, i'm not longer a romantic person, i can't express my feelings to my girlfriend, i used to be a very romantic guy, writing poems, calling at night and doing all that, but my past relationship damaged me and dried me, and now i'm 9 months into this relationship but i just can't tell her how i feel, i don't know what's wrong with me, i love her so much, but i can't really express it, i've tried so many times but words just won't come out, i just freeze in time,i no longer write how i feel, i lost that motivation and i'm afraid i lost that side for ever !and it's really making me unhappy, i wish i could find someone who can help me, thank you for your time.
