Highlighting selected geojson feature and return to previous state when another one is selected using Leaflet? I've a map with a geojson layer containing markers, polygons and lines. I made a module so that when a feature is clicked, its properties are displayed in a frame and not in standard Leaflet popup. It works perfectly well and I'm quite happy with it. Point is that I'd like to have the selected feature to highlight when clicked and return to unselected state when another one is clicked. Do you have an idea on how I can achieve that ?
