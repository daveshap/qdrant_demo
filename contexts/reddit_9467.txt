What's the fucking point of insurance?
My healthy tree in my yard got it's ass kicked in a wind storm two nights ago.  It fell into the street, and hit the power lines and caused everyone on my block to be without power for a day.

The city came by, cleared the road, and put all the debris into my lawn and told me that the tree is so badly damaged, it's dangerous, and could fall onto my home.  

Here's the kicker, because there was no damage to my actual physical home (lawn is destroyed, the healthy tree is destroyed) my insurance won't pay for the debris removal or tree removal even though I pay extra for that exact coverage... but I guess ONLY in the scenario if the tree hit my home.

Like, I get it if I wasn't keeping up with it's maintenance, but this was a healthy tree that got destroyed during a tornado.  If I remove this 50 foot oak, not only will the value of my house drop, but I will lose the shade and cooling it provides.

And now, because the tree is considered a hazard, if in 6 months it falls, insurance could deny the claim because I didn't take care of the tree now.

This is a rant/vent/anger session.  I know I sound whiny.  I'm having a hard time understanding why I'm going to have to pay upwards of 5k due to damage from a wind storm.
