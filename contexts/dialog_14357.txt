WOMAN: How 'bout over there? No wait. Do me a favor. Bring 'em to the back room.
JACOB: They're awfully heavy.
WOMAN: I know. That's why I'm asking.
JACOB: Where's Wong?
WOMAN: That's what I'd like to know. If you see him on the street somewhere, tell him he's fired.
JACOB: How was Palm Springs?
WOMAN: Hot. Where do I sign?
JACOB: You got a nice tan, though.
WOMAN: Tan? What tan? It faded on the airplane. I'd try to get my money back, but who do you ask? Two hundred dollars a night, for what?
JACOB: No. I'll take the other one. Right. Well it's good to have you back. See you tomorrow, probably.
WOMAN: If you're lucky.
