CONNOR: Now, you will receive us.
MURPHY: We do not ask for your poor or your hungry.
CONNOR: We do not want your tired and sick.
MURPHY: It is your corrupt we claim.
CONNOR: It is your evil, who will be sought by us.
MURPHY: With every breath we shall hunt them down.
CONNOR: Each day we will spill their blood till it rains down from the skies.
MURPHY: Do not kill, do not rape, do not steal. These are principles which every man of every faith can embrace.
CONNOR: These are not polite suggestions. They are codes of behavior and those that ignore them will pay the dearest cost.
MURPHY: There are varying degrees of evil. We urge you lesser forms of filth Not to push the bounds and cross over into true corruption... into our domain.
CONNOR: For if you do, there will come the day when you look behind you and see we three. And on that day you will reap it.
MURPHY: And we will send you to whatever God you wish.
