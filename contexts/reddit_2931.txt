Well paying jobs with less human interaction ?
Hi guys. 

I'm pretty bad at human interaction. I'm an introvert, awkward and distant, and I always have trouble putting on the professional client-facing face that my coworkers do. I ended up in digital marketing and 2 years in, there's not much people interaction but as my career progresses I know there will be (i.e. company expands or if I join another company). I'm also losing interest in my current digital marketing role. So I'm not really looking forward to how my career progresses. 

I'm rethinking the path I'm on. I'm 27 (med school drop out, got lost a bit) which I feel is already too old to rethink things(I guess I'm comparing to my peers) but I really want to enjoy what I do. **Money** is a huge factor and I would like to reach a good salary fast.

A part from just going with it and getting used to people, is there a route I can take to a well paying marketing job with less interactions, or does it get worse from here? :/

If there's any other less/no people, well paying career paths, please do share. I am truly lost because the people thing is an issue for me :( and I'm bad at it no matter how much I try. I am willing to study subjects on the side if it means I can find something I enjoy. 

About me: 27f, I like research, being pedantic about little things (lol), environmental conservation, science, art, how the universe works, and the theoretical side of marketing. School subject faves were biology and physics, but I never dabbled in commerce so I don't know if I would have liked it. Since leaving my bad experience in med school, I've stayed away from science.

Please help! Questions , advice, tips, anything is appreciated.

Thank you !!

Edit: Thank you everyone for your responses, encouragement and guidance! I'm looking into a few things now. Hope everyone in a similar positions as myself finds their way too<3
