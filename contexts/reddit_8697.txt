What public positions has Trump/The Trump Administration taken in respect to unions?
Wondering what Trump has said and done regarding unions both as a politician and as a businessman.

Google provided mixed results. A mod here showed me this [Speech Trump gave to a labor union a few months ago.](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/04/04/remarks-president-trump-2017-north-americas-building-trades-unions) Trump discusses wanting to keep these workers gainfully employed. To do this, he says he's taking action "...to eliminate job-killing regulations that stand in the way." However, he didn't make the distinction that despite this plan, regulations protecting unions would remain safe. 

Last and most importantly, I'm wondering how his thoughts and actions will affect unions moving forward.

Thanks!
