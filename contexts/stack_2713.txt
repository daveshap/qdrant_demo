How to calculate height of a bouncing ball? I'm wanting to create a basic physics engine for a Computing project, simulating the behaviour of a bouncing ball. What equations and forces do I need to incorporate to calculate the height a ball will rebound to from the height that it is dropped?If I drop a ball from 5m, what equation do I plug it into and what other factors will I need to include to calculate the height it will return to or how do I find the lost energy?
