Vicious cycle in HR/Recruiter/Talent Acquisition jobs - my first post
Hi guys, I have about two years of Recruitment/Talent Acquisition experience. I was laid off of my position due to COVID-19. Initially I was networking with Recruiters and hiring managers on LinkedIn and applying on Indeed. I had a few referrals, but those companies don’t have Recruiter/Talent Acquisition jobs available. With most companies on a hiring freeze, Recruiters and TA roles were first to go. Lots of companies aren’t ready to begin hiring back employees, so there are very few positions to apply to. 

Not sure what to try differently. I’m in Colorado. Being new to the industry, I don’t have a ton of friends/connections either.  

It’s hard to get back into HR once you leave, so I really don’t want to take a position outside of it. Besides, it’s what I’m passionate about. Is this just something I’ll have to wait out?
