Are any of you familiar with this blog, "100 Reasons NOT to Go to Graduate School?"
http://100rsns.blogspot.com/p/complete-list-to-date.html

I'm a first year History PhD and I found myself reading this at the library while procrastinating on getting into my books for a paper. I feel utterly devastated because I feel like I can't refute any of these reasons they give (especially because this blog specifically focuses on humanities). It's been a really, really tough end to the semester and I'm just, I feel so unhappy and defeated and I shouldn't have read this but I did.
