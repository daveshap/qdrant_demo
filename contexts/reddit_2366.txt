Anybody else hoping to make lifelong friends in college cuz they never really clicked with anyone in high school
The title says it all. I was always the kid who people wanted to be acquainted with, but not necessarily included in any friend groups. I'm the "smart kid" who people only really want to talk to when they need help with homework or want me to be in their group when it comes to doing group projects so they don't have to do much of the work. I just can't wait to go to college and be surrounded by people who think like me and would gladly want to be friends. Anyone else?
