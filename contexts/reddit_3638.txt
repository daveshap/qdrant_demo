Something I learned recently: people that go all in really quickly tend to disappear just as quick
I've met a couple of people like this and I've finally learned something from it.

If somebody goes all in really quickly (I'm thinking within weeks), then that's got to be a major red flag. Because my experience is those who go all in really quickly will say they are suddenly not interested (if they're nice) or just disappear - just as quick.

Learn from my mistakes!
