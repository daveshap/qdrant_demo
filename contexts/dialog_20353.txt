FOLEY: You comfy?
KAREN: If I could have a little more room.
FOLEY: There isn't any. All this shit you got in here. What is all this stuff anyway? Handcuffs, chains... what's this can?
KAREN: For your breath. You could use it. Squirt some in your mouth.
FOLEY: You devil, it's mace, huh? What've you got here, a billy? Use it on poor unfortunate offenders.
FOLEY: Where's your gun, your pistol?
KAREN: In my bag, in the car.
