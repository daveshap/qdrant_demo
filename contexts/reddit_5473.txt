Is there anything I need to get certified for before joining a fishing boat crew? Do they do timed contracts, or seasonal work?
I honestly don't know much about how commercial fishing works, I just know that I've wanted to be a crew member since I was a kid and if I can try it out and make money doing it, it sounds like a good thing to at least try.  If it means anything I can work a sailboat, I don't get seasick and I'm in pretty good physical condition. 

However this wouldn't be a long time thing for me. It wouldn't be my career for more than a year, I mean. Maybe this question is stupid.
