BUD: Mr. Mannheim, got a sure thing. Anacott Steel.
MANNHEIM: No such thing Bud - 'cept death and taxes. Not a good company anymore, no fundamentals. What's going on Bud? Do you know something? Remember there're no short cuts son, quick buck artists come and go with every bull market but the steady players make it through the bear markets. You're part of something here, Bud. The money you make for people creates science and research jobs. Don't sell that out.
BUD: You're right, Mr. Mannheim, but you gotta get to the big time first, then you can be a pillar and do good things.
MANNHEIM: Can't get a little bit pregnant, Bud.
BUD: It's a winner Mr. Mannheim, trust me -- buy.
