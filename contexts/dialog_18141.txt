ETHAN: Here's to you, Luther. To being off the disavowed list.
LUTHER: Hey, I'm the flavour of the month!
ETHAN: You're more than that, Luther. They were mistaken about you and they're trying to show you they know it. They want you back in.
LUTHER: Sure. They want me back in so I won't break in! They <i>still</i> can't figure out how we did it.
ETHAN: You didn't tell 'em at the debriefing?
LUTHER: I figured I'd let 'em reinstate my back pay, give me a promotion, check out my office at Langley and <i>then</i>, maybe, talk about it.
ETHAN: It's all one big negotiation, isn't it?
LUTHER: Why don't you come back with me?
ETHAN: Just don't know why I'd be doing it.
LUTHER: You really liked Phelps, didn't you?
ETHAN: He was a good guy for a long, long time. Just - not long enough. Gotta catch my flight.. So. How's it feel being a solid citizen again?
LUTHER: Oh man...I don't know. I'm gonna miss being disreputable.
ETHAN: Well, Luther - if it makes you feel any better I'll always think of you that way.
