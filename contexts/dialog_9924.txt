FRANCES: It's going to be slow from now on. Do you know what I mean, Harry?
HARRY: I'm not sure.
FRANCES: Very slow. But we're not going to stop, are we?
HARRY: No.
FRANCES: No, we're not.
FRANCES: Goodbye, Harry. It was very good to see you again.
HARRY: Yes. Would you like me to walk a little way with you?
FRANCES: That would be okay.
HARRY: Just a little way.
