Why are wave packets constructed so that the maximum probability occurs at K0 (the average wave number)? The definition of a wave packet I have been given is that it is \"a superposition of many plane waves, with wave numbers grouped around an average value $k_0$\".I was told that, for a particle we want, its wave packet to be such that it has a maximum probability at $k_0$ - but I was under the impression that you integrate your probability density function with respect to position, not wave-number. Have I misunderstood the concept of a wave-packet? Could someone actually explain to me what they are? edit: I'm asking about why we are considering values of the wave-number when determining the maximum probability of localising a particle in space and not the values of x(along the x-axis, if we think about it in one dimension). How would we relate the position of a wave and its wavenumber together? If you can do that
