UTAH: ... so I started tailing him.
PAPPAS: This Zen master surfer.
UTAH: Bodhi, yeah. I'm on him all day, right. He goes here, he goes there, he goes to Tower Records and buys come CDs, he has lunch at Patrick's Road House... ... he goes into the Assured Trust Savings and Loan.
PAPPAS: Did he rob it?
UTAH: Cute. He was inside for about 20 minutes. The other guy, Roach, waited in the truck. They were scoping it out, right?!
UTAH: Yeah, or cashing a check.
UTAH: Wait, wait. Then these guys go back to their beach house and box up all their shit. Load it in Bodhi's truck and take it to a public storage unit. You see? Summer's almost over. They're splitting. They're gonna pick up a little traveling money tomorrow. The next day at the outside latest. I got a feeling.
PAPPAS: Last time you got a feeling I had to kill a man, which I always hate because it looks bad on the report.
UTAH: Angelo... I'm right this time. We can still win this one.
