JULIE: I didn't realise! Those were de-caps! I didn't know that....de-caps... revived!
RHODES: Any dead whose brains are intact will revive.
JULIE: But...we bury the heads. Oh. God! It must be torture for them!
RHODES: They are brutes without feeling. Though I admit that I've requested cremation for myself. Burial is an archaic tradition, even more ridiculous now than it ever was. To say nothing of the...spacing problem...on a small island like this.
JULIE: I thought the purpose of decapitation was to...to...
RHODES: The purpose of decapitation is to preserve as much...food...as possible. The purpose for feeding is to keep the beasts on our side. The fact that they can be taught to clean up our garbage or to fire a gun is a convenient side benefit, not the primary goal. The primary goal is to keep ourselves from becoming their supper. Keep them fed and they behave. Keep them hungry and they revert back to being the animals that they have always been. You saw them in there.
MARY: You gave them a fresh taste of blood!
RHODES: They will never be satisfied with anything else, Miss Henried. They want human flesh. I'm prepared to take whatever steps are necessary to see to it they don't get mine! Not while I'm still using it!
