TERRY: —It started as a favor— for my brother— you know they'd ask me things and it's hard to say no— a favor— Who am I kiddin'? They call it a favor but it's do it or else. And this time the favor turned out to be helping them knock off Joey. I just thought they'd lean on him a little but— Last night with Edie I wanted to tell her only it— stuck in my throat. I guess I was scared of drivin' her away— and I love her, Father. She's the first thing I ever loved.
FATHER BARRY: What are you going to do?
TERRY: About Edie?
FATHER BARRY: Edie. The Commission. Your subpoena. I know you got a subpoena.
TERRY: It's like carrying a monkey around on your back.
FATHER BARRY: A question of who rides who.
TERRY: If I spill, my life won't be worth a nickel.
FATHER BARRY: How much is your soul worth if you don't?
TERRY: But it's my own brother they're askin' me to finger— and Johnny Friendly. His mother and my mother was first cousins. When I was this high he took me to the ball games... .
FATHER BARRY: Ball games! Don't break my heart! I wouldn't care if he gave you a life pass to the Polo Grounds. So you got a brother. Well, let me tell you something you got some other brothers— and they're all getting the short end while your cousin Johnny gets mustard on his face at the Polo Grounds. If I was you— — Listen, I'm not asking you to do anything, Terry. It's your own conscience that's got to do the asking.
TERRY: Conscience... . I didn't even know I had one until I met you and Edie... this conscience stuff can drive you nuts.
FATHER BARRY: Good luck.
TERRY: Is that all you've got to say to me, Father?
