MOTHER SISTER: The evil eye doesn't work on me.
DA MAYOR: Mother Sister, you've been talkin' 'bout me the last eighteen years. What have I ever done to you?
MOTHER SISTER: You're a drunk fool.
DA MAYOR: Besides that. Da Mayor don't bother nobody. Nobody don't bother Da Mayor but you. Da Mayor just mind his business. I love everybody. I even love you.
MOTHER SISTER: Hold your tongue. You don't have that much love.
DA MAYOR: One day you'll be nice to me. We might both be dead and buried, but you'll be nice. At least civil.
