DANIEL: Did you know about Bastaldi's deal with Zammito?
MARCEL: No.
DANIEL: You're sure?
MARCEL: I think if he told me he was going to steal Van Gogh's Sunflowers in a vase" I would remember it."
SAMI: Vase with twelve Sunflowers.""
MARCEL: Whatever! He never told me about the Van Gogh or any of the other paintings.
SAMI: It makes sense. I mean, do you really think he would come along if he knew we were being set up?
DANIEL: I think he'd cut his dick off if Bastaldi told him to.
MARCEL: Fuck you! You know I'd never go along with something like this.
DANIEL: Do I?
MARCEL: This ain't about that and you know it. This is about you never forgiving me for leaving the crew.
SAMI: You guys used to work together?
MARCEL: Yeah and he can't stand it that I tried to do something to better myself.
DANIEL: You call being Bastaldi's lap dog better?
MARCEL: Better than spending my life crawling through windows in the middle of the night.
SAMI: All right, knock it off.
DANIEL: All you are is a professional ass-kisser.
MARCEL: I'm not a guy who is known for his patience and right now you're testing mine.
DANIEL: What is that a threat? Are you fuckin' threatening me, Marcel?
SAMI: I said knock it off! Now as far as I'm concerned you two girls can bitch slap yourselves silly when this is over, but right now we've got to figure out what's going on.
RAYMOND: It's simple. Bastaldi's moving up. He's closing down his operation and this is his way of saying thanks to all of us.
