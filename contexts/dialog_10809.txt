LOUIS: Your honor, may I approach the bench?
JUDGE: Yes.
LOUIS: Can I have some of your water?
JUDGE: Get on with it, counselor!
LOUIS: Your honor, ladies and gentlemen of the -- audience. I don't think it's fair to call my clients frauds. Okay, the blackout was a big problem for everybody. I was stuck in an elevator for about three hours and I had to go to the bathroom the whole time, but I don't blame them because once I turned into a dog and they helped me. Thank you.
