I hate my voice
There's something about my voice I've just always hated. It's not that it's too high pitched or too low pitched(though it's higher pitched than I'd like it to be), it's just kind of annoying sounding to me. I think it also annoys other people too, though I've never been told it does. When I speak I hear myself differently then the way other people hear me, because when I heard myself speak via video for the first time I hated the way my voice sounded. It sounded completely different than the way I perceived myself to sound. I even went through a period of time when I purposely changed my voice, though I couldn't keep it up for long.. Oddly enough I think it's effecting my confidence, because a lot of the time I'll think if I talk than It'll just come out annoying so I just keep quiet most of the time. Also my voice doesn't fit the way I physically look either, I feel as if god accidentally mixed up my voice with some one else... I just wanna rant. Feels good actually, talking about something without having to listen to myself sound stupid.
