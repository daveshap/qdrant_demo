my parents won’t let me decide my own bedtime
i am currently a 16 year old girl living with my parents. on school nights there’s a rule that i have to go to sleep at 10:30 and put my phone out in the lounge. during weekends i’m responsible for my own bedtime which i’m happy with. however, i believe that i should be given that responsibility on school nights also but my parents refuse to hear me out and it always results in an argument. i’ve tried to explain to them that i’m old enough to be responsible for my own bedtime and if i do have to have a bedtime, 10:30 is too early for a 16 year old girl.

i’m now on study leave for my exams and i’m waking up at 10 every morning but they’re making me go to sleep at 11 with my phone in the lounge. i want to decide my own bedtime, which would change depending on what time i’m waking up the next morning, and i’d always make sure i’d get enough sleep. what should i do?
