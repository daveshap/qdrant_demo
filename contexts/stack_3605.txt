Blind SQL Injection on Amazon RDS I found a vulnerability which allows me to run any query on an Amazon RDS server. I was able to extract the user hashes by using the --passwords parameter of sqlmap, and one of the hashes was cracked before. The thing is, I'm not sure that first the Amazon RDS Instance is accessible from the internet (specifically any IP), and I'm not sure how I could get the ip of the RDS instance (--hostname returns internal 172.x.x.x address). I'm wondering if there is anything I can do to further escalate the vulnerability.
