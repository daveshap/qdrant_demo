GRACE: Get real Bobby. He was gonna kill you <u>and</u> me.
BOBBY: He was in love with you Grace. He would've done what you wanted, you could've made a deal and ...
GRACE: The only deal he had in mind was killing you for Jake's murder and blackmailing me into sucking his dick for the rest of my life... no thanks.
BOBBY: He was a <u>cop</u>, Grace, they never stop looking for you when you kill a cop...
GRACE: He was a scumbag!... He wanted <u>me</u>, Bobby. These guys don't let go! Even when they're <u>dead</u>... You don't know what it was like, Bobby. Those two, they were the same.
GRACE: So, aren't you going to ask me?
BOBBY: Ask you what? You mean what kind of horrifying sick shit is coming next?
GRACE: Don't you want to know...? I bet it's burning a hole in your brain just now?
BOBBY: Let it go, baby. It's the past. I got a past...
GRACE: Don't you really want to know? Was Jake my Daddy? Was I fucking my own Daddy? Don't you want to know that?
