ROBIN: You think Skipper and Alice do it?
CHUCK: Do what?
ROBIN: Ya know... It"."
CHUCK: That's like wondering if your mom and dad do it. Who wants to know?
JOHN: She isn't that old.
CHUCK: What do you mean?
JOHN: I mean she looks pretty damn good in her all-together for being thirty.
ROBIN: How would you know?
JOHN: Trust me donut. I know.
ROBIN: What? Come on...
JOHN: On the dog watch, night after the storm, I look down into the skylight above Skipper's cabin and there she was, peelin' down.
CHUCK: No way!
ROBIN: Come on man, what'd they look like?
JOHN: Damn, Porkchop, you sound just like a guy who ain't never seen a pair.
ROBIN: I've seen 'em. I've seen 'em.
CHUCK: I walked in on my parents one time. It was only like eight o'clock and they were in bed and I thought that was kinda weird so I just walked in.
JOHN: That's what they get for not locking the door.
CHUCK: So I'm standing there and you could hear a pin drop. No breathing or snoring... Suddenly it hits me that somethin' was goin' on that just stopped, really fast, like people are holding their breath.
ROBIN: So... What happened?
CHUCK: My mother says in this really low, but very awake kind of voice What?""
ROBIN: What'd you do?
CHUCK: I said Sorry
