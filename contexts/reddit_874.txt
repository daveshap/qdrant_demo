does anyone get extremely anxious when people around them are angry or mad?
so, i have noticed that whenever someone around me is in a bad mood especially if they are frustrated or angry, i get this feeling like i just wanna hide and lock myself in a box. i usually rush to my room, turn off all the lights to calm myself, put on my earphone and play the loudest music to drain out any loud voices. i think this comes from my traumatic childhood because my parents were always screaming at each other. anyways, does anyone do this? i need some feedback cuz im pretty sure i have anxiety but i dint wanna diagnose myself too early.
