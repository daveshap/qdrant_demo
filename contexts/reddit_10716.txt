What else can I do instead of suicide?
Could I run away to some obscure country? Would I leave my old identity behind leave my mum make a missing person report?

Should I just do something completely fucking stupid and Fuck my life up more? At least if everyone knows I’m useless then they won’t expect anything good from me and I’ll be left alone. 

I don’t want to kill myself that badly but I don’t want to continue living, not like this. 

My situation isn’t even that bad, I just can’t get this anxiety, insecurity, overthinking, depression out of my fucking head. For years and years I’ve been trapped. Maybe escaping for a little while but always reverting back and almost always worse. 

I just cannot be fucking bothered living anymore. Im tired 24/7. Socialising is so difficult with this mess in my head, and all I want is friends and a partner but all I do is lose friends and isolate myself because I’m fucked in the head. I just don’t know what to do, I feel like maybe I’ve got some undiagnosed autism or something because I just feel like my brain works differently and i just DONT know what to do about 95% of the time. My “cool confidence” is completely fake, I’m just trying to fake it till I make it but it’s obviously fake, I just embarrass myself again and again. 

Maybe I’m asking for advice, maybe I’m venting. This subreddit is so great, I can relate to so many other sad souls and that makes me feel a little bit better.

EDIT: Thanks for all the great replies everyone. I wish I could give a meaningful reply to all of them but it would take too long. <3 you all
