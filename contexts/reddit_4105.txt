Asked the girl I've been seeing for a month out last week and she said she'd "let me know her schedule". Well I knew what that meant so I just disengaged. Lo and behold, 3 days later she actually texted me her schedule. Do I have to marry this woman now?
I'm actually shook. It's like finding a damn unicorn out there.

P.S. She was busy this week but said next week might work. 

P.P.S. shoutout to the people who think I was actually going to marry this girl over this. I was just pleasantly surprised she bothered to follow through with this. 99% of the time, as I've seen in real life and on Reddit, "I'll let you know" is the gentle way to ghost someone
