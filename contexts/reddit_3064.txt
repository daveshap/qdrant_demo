What jobs can I get with a Masters in History?
Hello everyone,

I'm 29 years old with a Masters degree in History and a Post-Graduate Certificate in Digital Curation.  In spite of this, I am having a lot of trouble with landing a job.  In the past I have applied to entry-level positions in museums and libraries, very rarely have I been interviewed for any of the positions I've applied for, and when I do get an interview, somehow I mess it up.

I could use a lot of help.  While I would love to be able to work in an archive/library/research setting, I feel incapable of finding that job.  Given the amount of rejections, it is more and more difficult to be positive about my chances of finding a job in this field.  I was wondering if anyone here had some advice for me about getting a job in information services.  I'm also open to suggestions for alternative career paths.  Thank you.
