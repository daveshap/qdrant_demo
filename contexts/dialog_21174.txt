KILLAINE: I'll find out, you know. Perhaps not today--perhaps not tomorrow. But in the end, I'll find out.
BETTY: The police always do, don't they?
KILLAINE: You've has an experience that you don't want to talk about. An unhappy marriage, for example.
KILLAINE: I wouldn't make you talk about it. My job is the death of Marry Mitchell. Why can't you give me your confidence?
BETTY: You--or the Vancouver Police Department?
KILLAINE: We try to be decent.
BETTY: You're a police officer. A very nice one--but you have a job to do. I'm a girl who's in a jam, and it's your job to keep me there. Don't go considerate on me. I might start to bawl.
KILLAINE: You won't tell me who you are? You won't even give me a chance to help you?
BETTY: Nobody can help me. You, least of all.
KILLAINE: If I understand what you meant by that.
BETTY: You understand perfectly.
KILLAINE: Then there isn't much I can do, is there?
BETTY: There isn't anything you can do.
