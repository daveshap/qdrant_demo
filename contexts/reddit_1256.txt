I’ve applied for two jobs!!
I just wanted to share some good news. I’ve always been terrified of getting a job, but I’m trying my best to be brave. I’ve applied for a job at a grocery store, and I just applied for a job at a doggy daycare. I feel like because I don’t have any past experience it’s going to be really hard to get a job but I’m going to just apply anyway. Better to try and to fail, than to not try at all. I’m so scared of getting a job but I really want to get moving forward in life. Wish me luck!! 

Edit: ahhhhh thank you all for your support I’m so happy and excited!!! I’ll probably post when I get a job!! Time to make me some money!!
