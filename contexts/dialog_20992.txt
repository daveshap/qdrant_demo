SUSAN: ... just like the mouse.
O'BRIEN: Mouse? What mouse?
SUSAN: My first organic-polymerization was a lab mouse.
O'BRIEN: What happened to it?
SUSAN: I don't know.
O'BRIEN: You don't know?
SUSAN: It escaped from the lab before we could finish the experiment.
O'BRIEN: But you've polymerized single-celled bacteria and the fruit flies, I know you have.
SUSAN: Yes.
O'BRIEN: Then you must have at some point tried to reverse the procedure.
O'BRIEN: Oh no, no, no! You've got to be able to fix me! Please, Susan, tell me you can make me normal again!
SUSAN: Once the subject was polymerized we were unable to reassemble the original organic structure.
O'BRIEN: Oh God, please! This can't be happening! I can't be plastic! A plastic man?!
SUSAN: Daniel!
O'BRIEN: I'm a plastic man! A plastic man!
SUSAN: We don't have time for hysterics.
O'BRIEN: We don't?
SUSAN: What has happened to you is nothing compared to what is going to happen to Calumet City if we don't hurry.
O'BRIEN: What are these?
SUSAN: Mostly caffeine diuretics. Help you go to the bathroom.
O'BRIEN: Why?
SUSAN: The nanobot is still inside you. It's programmed to exit through the urinary tract. We need it as soon as possible, so swallow those.
O'BRIEN: Pills... you know how I feel about pills.
SUSAN: If you don't want to do it this way, I can remove it surgically.
O'BRIEN: Why do we need it?
SUSAN: The nanobot is the only thing that can stabilize the waste.
O'BRIEN: What waste?
