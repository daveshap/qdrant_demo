COOLEY: End of the road, boys. It's had its twists and turns -
EVERETT: Waitaminute -
COOLEY: - but now it deposits you here.
EVERETT: Waitaminute -
COOLEY: You have eluded fate - and eluded me - for the last time. Tie their hands, boys.
EVERETT: You can't do this -
COOLEY: Didn't know you'd be bringin' a friend. Well, he'll have to wait his turn -
EVERETT: Hang on there -
COOLEY: - and share one of your graves.
EVERETT: You can't do this - we just been pardoned! By the Governer himself!
