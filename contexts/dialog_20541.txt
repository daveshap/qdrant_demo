GABRIEL: What now, sir?
MARION: We put out the word. We'll start along the south side of the Santee...
GABRIEL: We'd cover more ground if we split up.
MARION: It's safer if we stay together.
GABRIEL: Colonel, I didn't request this transfer because you're my father. I requested it because I believe in this cause and this is where I can do the most good.
MARION: Oh?
GABRIEL: I've been doing this for two years. I'm the best scout in the Continental Army, the best horseman, the best shot, the best scavenger and I know every deer path and swamp trail between here and Charleston.
MARION: Is that so?
GABRIEL: Yes, sir. My father taught me.
MARION: Did your father teach you humility?
GABRIEL: He tried. It didn't take.
MARION: Alright, Corporal, you take Bennington, Harrisville, Acworth and the farms along Black Swamp. I'll take the north side of the river. We'll meet at Snow's Island.
GABRIEL: Yes, sir.
MARION: And, Corporal... ... be careful.
GABRIEL: Yes... ... father.
