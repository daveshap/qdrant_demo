Would you reject a job with a 2 hour commute (one-way) every two weeks?
The job I’m offered has two offices. The main one is less than a 10 minute drive from my apartment. However they would also expect  me to commute 2 hours by car to their other office every two weeks. Whatever I do for them at one office they want me to do at the other. Some of their events I would hold could run late. So I would get home pretty late. I’m pretty worried about soaring gas prices, weather conditions, how beat up my car will get. 

Also, Is it reasonable to expect gas/mileage money in compensation for going to their second office? 

Thanks.
