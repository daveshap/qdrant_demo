Got terminated and then two recruiter added me on LinkedIn of the same company?
I got terminated during my probation for reasons that even they couldn't explain when I asked so that I can improve on my limitations but alas, they had no answer. I thought that it's over for me. The company in which I used to work for has claimed the relocation money which they had given me to relocate & created a payment plan for 6 months for me to give it back to them. 

Now after 20 days or so, two senior recruiters of the same company who have been there for 8-10 years from the same location where I was terminated from added me on LinkedIn for some reason. I don't know them but why would they add me knowing I am longer in the company itself? What can be the reason/motive behind this? Is it to keep a tab on me or what? Any ideas?
