ARIANE: I can't get over what those guys did to her. I just can't.
LT: They're alive, aren't they? Come on, man! Everyone's making such a fucking fuss, just because she's a nun. Just because she wears a penguin suit, the church puts up 50 G for the guys who dared to rape her. Do you think they'd put up a dime if you got raped? Of course not. Or even for your little sister? The virgin? Like shit they would.
ARIANE: Susie's not a virgin anymore.
LT: She's fucking nine years old! Jesus Christ.
