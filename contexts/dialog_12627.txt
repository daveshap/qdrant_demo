LAURA: Fix it up. It'll make you feel better.
ROB: I'll bet you can't remember what you were doing here, can you? I mean, how much are you making now? Sixty? Seventy? And you were living in this shitty place.
LAURA: You know I didn't mind. And it's not as if Ray's place is any better.
ROB: I'm sorry, but can we get this straight? What is his fucking name, Ian or Ray? What do you call him?
LAURA: Ray. I hate Ian.
ROB: I hate him too. So I just call him Mavis." Or "Sissyboy." Or "Mavis the Sissyboy.""
ROB: This is where you're supposed to say that you haven't laughed this much in ages, and then you see the error of your ways.
LAURA: You make me laugh much more than Ray does, if that's what you're getting at. But I already knew you could make me laugh. It's everything else I don't know about.
ROB: You know I'm a good person.
LAURA: Mmm hmm.
ROB: You know that I can cook my ass off when I feel like it.
LAURA: Oh ho, so very infrequently.
