DANA: Is that your professional opinion?
VENKMAN: It's in the stars.
STANTZ: Why don't I check out the building? It may have a history of psychic turbulence.
VENKMAN: Good idea. Were any other words spoken that you remember?
DANA: No, just that one word -- Zuul -- but I have no idea what it means.
VENKMAN: Spengler, see if you can find the word Zuul" in any of the literature. I'll take Miss Barrett home and check out her apartment."
VENKMAN: Have you ever thought of moving out -- at least until this disturbance blows over?
DANA: No. If I moved out now I'd be acknowledging that what happened was real. I'm not ready to do that.
VENKMAN: You play the cello! It's my favorite instrument.
DANA: Really? Do you have a favorite piece?
VENKMAN: I'd have to say Prokofiev's third concerto.
DANA: That's a violin concerto.
VENKMAN: Yeah, but it's got a great cello break.
DANA: You really don't act like a scientist.
VENKMAN: No? What do I act like?
DANA: Like a used car salesman.
VENKMAN: Thanks. What's in there?
