PIN diode in RF switching vs. PIN diode used as photodiode From what I understand, there are traditional photodiode components that are designed with PIN diodes, in which the gate is activated by light saturation.  For a PIN diode component made for RF switching applications, the gate is operated by applying a forward bias current.How closely related are these two types of components? For example, if I take a photodiode and fully saturate the sensor with light, would it operate in the same fashion as an RF PIN diode? Would an RF signal be able to pass?
