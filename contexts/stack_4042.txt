Can I apply for spousal visa ? I have been refused under 320 7(a) I am married to a girl in the UK. We are now planing to apply for a spousal visa. I was refused under 320 7(a) in 2009 due to false bank statement submission. Will this automatic ban period affect this new visa application as it is a spousal visa and I was refused a student visa? Please help me find a way out if any.
