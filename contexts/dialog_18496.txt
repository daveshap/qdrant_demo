LONGFELLOW: Do you mind if I talk to you, Mary? You don't have to pay any attention to me.
BABE: No, I don't mind.
LONGFELLOW: All my life, I've wanted somebody to talk to. Back in Mandrake Falls, I always used to talk to a girl.
BABE: A girl?
LONGFELLOW: Oh, an imaginary one. I used to hike a lot through the woods and I'd always take this girl with me so I could talk to her. I'd show her my pet trees and things. Sounds kind of silly but we had a lot of fun doing it.
