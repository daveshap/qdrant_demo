I'm not chasing any more.
Okay, so I guess this year I have been thinking a decent amount about relationships/dating. I am a 25 y/o Male and I do lots of exercise, both physically and mentally, and am always trying to improve myself. 

So how does dating/girls fit in to this? The current dating climate is an extremely biased one in favour of females, nowhere is this represented more accurately than on Tinder. I have used Tinder in the past and it always made me feel dirty, like why do I have to think of a clever opening message in order to warrant a reply? 

I am not inferior, nor do I have to prove anything to you in the hope that you give me the grace of a response. Fuck that. 

And then there is the club scene. Personally I have enjoyed much more success/enjoyment from meeting girls irl when out, and had some fun. But today I was volunteering and chatting to a female colleague, we were discussing this topic and she said that she doesn't particularly enjoy getting approached by guys in clubs (she's actually a lesbian) but if she doesn't then it can damage her confidence when many of the other girls in the club are getting approached. 

I mean, I respect her honesty and I like her as a friend. But is this the female mentality nowadays with regards to guys? We are simply used as a tool for validation whether that be through a Tinder swipe/message or an approach in a club? 

Anyways, it kinda made me realise that I am doing a disservice to myself by chasing girls. Its empowering to live a life where you are improving social skills, making new friends, learning a language, getting stronger both physically and mentally, travelling etc. Its not empowering to chase girls in the hope that one of them will like you enough to date you. 

So whatever, from now on I am not using dating apps, not asking out girls unless they are making it extremely clear that they want me to, and not making dating a main focus in my life. I would encourage others to do the same too! :)
