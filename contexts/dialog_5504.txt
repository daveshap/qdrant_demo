THEO: Somebody better tear this down before it falls down.
NELSON: Stay put! I know my way around.
LENORE: Nels?
NELSON: I'm still in my cab -- jammed up in traffic. Are you there yet?
LENORE: Any minute.
NELSON: I was worried about you. Both of you.
LENORE: We've had our share of fuck-ups but it's going to work out fine.
NELSON: Give me 20 minutes at least.
THEO: Who were you talking to?
NELSON: Them. They won't be expecting us.
THEO: Brilliant -- unless they were close enough to see the cab pull away. In which case you just warned them.
NELSON: Nobody can do anything right but you!
