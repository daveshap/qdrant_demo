IKE: I'm the only goddamn person in there pulling for you.
MAGGIE: You humiliated me!
IKE: No, Maggie, I defended you. Humiliating you is what everyone else is doing. It's the theme of this party.
MAGGIE: I had it under control. Now they feel sorry for me.
IKE: Well, they should. Because they're about to watch you hang yourself again.
MAGGIE: It's fun! It's high.
IKE: Or the sexual habits of locusts?
MAGGIE: That was very interesting research George was doing!
IKE: What kind of Dead Head gets a temporary tattoo?
MAGGIE: I already explained about that.
IKE: And where you ever really going to run the leper colony in Molokai?
MAGGIE: Brian told you that?
IKE: Or maybe you just wanted to wear the headdress.
MAGGIE: Every one of those times I was being supportive. Something you won't understand.
IKE: Supportive? You weren't being supportive. You were being scared. Just like now. You are the most lost woman I have ever laid eyes on.
MAGGIE: Lost!
IKE: That's right. You're so lost you don't even know how you like your eggs.
MAGGIE: What!?
IKE: With the priest, you liked them scrambled. With the Dead Head, fried. With the bug guy, poached. Now it's egg whites only, thank you very much.
MAGGIE: That's called changing your mind.
IKE: No, that's called not having a mind of your own. What are you doing, Maggie? You really want to let that man drag you up Annapuma on your honeymoon? You don't want to climb Annapuma.
MAGGIE: Yes I do!
IKE: No you don't. You want a man who will lead you down the beach with his head over your eyes just so you can discover the feel of the sand under your feet. You want a guy who will take you into a cave with a thousand candles just to read you a poem. You want a man to wake you up at dawn because he's burning to talk to you and he can't wait another minute to find out what you'll say. Am I right?
