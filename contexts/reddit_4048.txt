Does anyone else not care about asking someone out until you have a crush on them?
Am I the only one who has never really wanted to ask someone out before getting to know them/having some sort of feelings for the person? I've never seen someone and thought "Oh they're attractive let me talk to them/ask them out and see where it goes". 

Just curious if anyone else has had similar experience.
