I am 40 and cannot read due to disability. Just lost my job. Can you suggest a good path forward before I lose my house and family?
I don't intend this to be a thread about why I can't read, so I'll keep that story short. Lasik messed me up. Can't look at cell phones, watch TV, etc. I can do some minimal computer typing, but mostly I do it with eyes closed and then go back and double-check it at a glance.

I worked my way up in an industry over 17 years. Then, due to politics, some people fired me at a time when I'm raising a family. Because my disorder is so strange, I can't tell people in job interviews- it just makes me sound insane or stupid. But its extremely hard to find something not involving too much computer work or cell phones.

I'd love to learn a trade, but I cannot read magazines or text books. Can't go back to school. There are some audiobooks, but not enough to learn something like car repair.

I don't intend this to be a crying fit. I just honestly ask myself what direction I can take before I lose my house and my family. Thanks ahead of time for your guidance.
