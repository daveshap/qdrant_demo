Goodbye
\*\*UPDATE: I didn't do it. I made myself go to sleep. I didn't get all my letters/goodbyes done the way I needed to. Right now I feel empty, in a daze. I know I will lose this battle one day, but I'm kinda glad it wasn't last night. Also, thanks to all the people who commented that they care, means so much.\*\*

Hopefully, this is my last post. I'm not posting this for attention or pity, it's merely to show I was here, I was a person.

Right now nothing and everything hurts at the same time. I can't breathe, I can't stop crying. Why am I this weak, it's a disgrace to humankind.

I can't take this anymore. I'm sorry to all the people I love, even If the love was not returned.

Thanks for the memories life. Goodbye.
