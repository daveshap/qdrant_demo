STACY: Where's Mike today?
THE RAT: Today's April 16th. Damone never comes to school on April 16th.
STACY: What's April 16th?
THE RAT: It's John Bonham's birthday.
STACY: John Bonham?
THE RAT: John Bonham. The drummer for Led Zeppelin. He died a couple years ago. Every birthday he stays home and plays everything John Bonham ever recorded. It's like his own holiday.
STACY: Oh. I see.
