LOOMIS: The case is closed. Harry. Tapert's given us a full confession. Get your ass back to Mew York.
HARRY: No. I'm taking a couple of weeks' vacation.
LOOMIS: You never took a fucking vacation in your life, Harry. What's going on?
HARRY: I got to go. I'm late.
LOOMIS: Call me tomorrow.
HARRY: There's other guys as good as me, Loomis.
LOOMIS: Yeah. But not as cheap. Call me.
HARRY: A couple of weeks.
LOOMIS: One question.
HARRY: What?
LOOMIS: Who is she?
