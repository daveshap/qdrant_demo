Question on Oracle Public DB link inside Procedures Scenario : A procedure 'XYZ' is created with DB account 'SCOTT'. The procedure uses a public DB link to connect to another database.We have another user 'EVE' who has access to execute procedures owned by 'SCOTT'. If procedure XYZ is executed by EVE , how does the public DB link inside the procedure work? Does it use the credentials of SCOTT to connect to Target DB ( the owner) or does it use the credentials of EVE ( the executor)?
