HELEN: Hello, darling. Good evening, Mr. Carpenter.
KLAATU: Mrs. Benson -- this is Mr. Brady.
BOBBY: Mr. Brady's a cop.
HELEN: Did you have a nice day, dear?
BOBBY: Boy, we had a swell time. Didn't we, Mr. Carpenter?
KLAATU: We certainly did.
BOBBY: We went to the movies -- and we had ice cream cones -- and we went to see Daddy--
HELEN: I don't know how to thank you.
KLAATU: I enjoyed every minute of it.
