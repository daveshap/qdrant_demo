I turned in all the IegaI paperwork after they offered me the job,but I haven't heard anything back? What should I do? [Retail]
So they took my background check a couple days ago, and then gave me a job offer, and I accepted, and they said they'd email within 2 days, but they didn't, so I called them after the 3rd day, and the manager emailed the third-party hiring company,or something, and got them to send me the link to fill out all the IegaI papers (like an I9, or whatever. I have no clue what they all are needed for). Then, she said she'd like me on by Friday, if I can get the IegaI paper work done in time, but she never told me a time, and I don't have a uniform or anything. What should I do? Should I just wait? I mean it's been a day, and I don't want to miss my first day, if she actually did schedule me for Friday... (Yet she didn't say a time) (Plus, the interviewer seemed to really like me, so I doubt I've been fired already? Idrk)
