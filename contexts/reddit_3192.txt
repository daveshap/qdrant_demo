Last day of work. Should I throw awful managers under the bus ?
Hi all

Today is my last day . I’ve been with my current company for 6 years. 

Two years ago we got new managers that have been nightmares . They gossip about staff to other staff, don’t help at all, talk down to us, abuse their power and don’t know what they’re doing in general.

I got a new office job starting Monday and I used my original manager as my job reference .

At the end of my shift today I have an exit interview with HR and I’m not sure if I should just go quietly or if I should let them know that I am leaving because of the horrible new management (I’m the third person to quit just this month alone)

EDIT:
Another thing they did that irritates me ; after giving two weeks notice I used a sick day . When I went to enter it into the system my 5 sick days turned into 0. I went to HR and they said someone went into the system and deleted my sick days , HR fixed it for me. These are the kind of managers I’m dealing with so I am becoming less and less worried about burning bridges I have no desire to work in this field again 

UPDATE:

I had the meeting. It started off with some paper work and I decided I wasn’t going to say anything ... until they asked me. 

I let them know what the biggest issues were and how they could be improved. At the end of the day I don’t want to ever go back to that company/field and it’s not helping anyone if I stayed quiet. They were awful managers and I didn’t want to protect  them.
