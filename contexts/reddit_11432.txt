I was married 21 years. Have been divorced for 16 years. My youngest graduated college with a bachelor's and has decided to move out on her own.
With her graduating and getting her own place to live my kids and I decided to go thru the attic. We found some treasures and memories and junk and thankfully I didn't have to walk down memory lane by myself. We had a garage sale and I finally purged my life of everything past. I gave the photo albums to my kids and passed out family antiques I no longer want to watch over. My kids laughed and amazed over baby teeth and locks of hair and joked about first drawings and pictures and memories. They all have their own lives going now. It is what we want as parents. At first it felt great, I felt free in my heart. More so than ever before. Happy to have the past out of my home and free to move on. Now I feel lost and alone. I remarried 6 months ago after being single for 16 years. My husband doesn't know how to cope with my sudden roller-coaster of emotions. Nor do I, what is wrong with me and how can I fix it, fast! I feel like someone or something in my life has just died and I should be happy, not sad.
