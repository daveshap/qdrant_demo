CATHERINE: With Stargher I saw things...
NOVAK: What did you see?
CATHERINE: A kingdom. His utopia. Life without consequence or restriction. He's not even Carl Stargher anymore. He's this... idealized version of himself who can do anything he pleases... Without fear. A horrible primitive ugly thing. I don't want to talk in here.
CATHERINE: Why'd you bring him here?
NOVAK: You're the shrink, you tell me.
CATHERINE: As soon as I met him, you knew I'd say yes. He makes Julia real for me.
