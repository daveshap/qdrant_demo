Applying for a UK visa outside the Schengen country that issued my visa I have a student visa issued by France as well as a residency permit. I need a visit visa to travel to the UK. Due to my location it would be much easier to apply at the Geneva embassy as it is only 30 minutes away. Is this possible and allowed?
