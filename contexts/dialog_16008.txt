BECK: They found this?
DOC: No. I think they isolated him in genetic engineering. Homo aquaticus...
BECK: Was there such a thing?
DOC: Danakil man?...one of our ancestors. Named for the Danakil Alps in Ethiopia.
BECK: Not exactly a big ocean country.
DOC: It was when it counted a couple of million years ago when the seas came in and drove us into the water. Most homo sapiens didn't make it...Danakil man... <u>adapted</u>.
DOC: Some say that's why we're basically hairless, for less water resistance, faster swimming speeds...
BECK: But what about those scales... or that leech-like thing that bit Cobb?
DOC: Why stop with just one aspect of marine life? Why not incorporate the best genetic components the ocean has to offer?...
BECK: Well, if they were perfecting an aquaman, then why's there a dead one onboard that Russian ship? Why isn't he out swimming around?
