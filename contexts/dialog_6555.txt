HELEN: Kill me, Peter, do it, now.
PETER: No. Not yet.
HELEN: Do it. If that's what all this carnage is about, then do it. Have enough guts to do it.
PETER: Don't talk to me about courage. I know death, what it's like to kill. You're not a killer -- you watched Daryll Lee kill that cop and you didn't make a peep, because you were paralyzed with fear. You chocked. I know something <u>else</u> about you.
