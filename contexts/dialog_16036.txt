CLAUDE: Hey, Ray. I've been looking for you.
RAY: Here I am.
CLAUDE: Guess we better get going, huh?
RAY: Still got that ten dollars?
CLAUDE: Well, not exactly. See, I met this girl. Real nice girl. God-fearing girl. Her name's Sylvia.
RAY: That jelly you were talking to right here?
CLAUDE: She's in a tight spot. Her mama needs this operation, and they ain't got the money for it. Their church took up a collection but they were still short...
RAY: So you made a generous contribution.
CLAUDE: What can I say? When the spirit moves me.
RAY: That was mighty charitable of you, Claude. Looks like we both got fucked tonight.
CLAUDE: What are you talking about?
RAY: While you were upstairs doing God's work, I was getting jack-legged by a fool with four threes.
CLAUDE: You lost all our money in a card game?
RAY: He even got my daddy's watch.
CLAUDE: Fuck that cheap-ass watch -- I mean, how the hell are we gonna get home without any money?
RAY: We've still got 36 cases of rum. That's better than money.
