BOBBY: You talk to Max today?
JESS: I'm not gonna mention Ricky to him.
BOBBY: Don't expect you to mention it to him. I'm just saying, if --
JESS: The only way he'll go with Ricky is if you're in too.
BOBBY: Well, that's not gonna happen.
JESS: Fine. You want to help Ricky, talk to Maxie yourself.
BOBBY: I feel weird asking him.
JESS: You shouldn't. He likes you.
BOBBY: I just wish he never brought it up. Ricky won't shut up about it.
JESS: Forget Ricky. You should be glad Max got you driving for me.
BOBBY: No coke tonight. Right?
JESS: Leave me alone. I haven't touched anything in months.
