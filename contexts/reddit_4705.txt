Expectations and depressive episodes
**This perspective has helped me with severe, sudden episodes: **

Ok. So your brain has decided to take a massive shit on you. 

Fucking fantastic!

Don’t hold yourself to the standards of a functioning person! Accept that the episode is happening, and accept that for a bit, winning may be just as simple as taking care of basic necessities or accomplishing a single, small task. 

Giving 100% as a functioning person and giving 100% as a depressed person are *not* the same thing. We tell ourselves that we’re pathetic, weak, and not good enough, when in fact, were fighting harder than the functioning people, it just looks like less. 

Im proud if you can keep your head above water, because that takes a lot of strength. Trying in whatever capacity we can is enough. 

Hang in there
