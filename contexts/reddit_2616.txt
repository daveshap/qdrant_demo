25 and my career is RUINED. How do I get it back on track?
Hey everyone! I need some help. I am a 25-year-old college grad, trying to pursue a career in marketing/ media. However, due to a series of setbacks (some of them my fault, others not so much), my resume is terrible. It's basically a collection of short-term jobs, all of which have had really terrible endings...which is also an issue because it makes me uncomfortable using references. My work history is riddled with gaps, as well.

I feel like I'm in a hole, and don't know how to get my career back on track. I have so many resume gaps, and haven't even had one job for an entire year yet. I really want to start working on my professional goals, but feel as though a couple wrong moves that I made immediately after graduating have set the tone for my career moving forward- and it's very far from the one I wanted.

***Please note:*** *While grad school would be a good solution, I cannot afford it and even if I could, I've missed the deadlines for several schools with "mandatory summer starts"; meaning I'd have to wait until summer 2021 to start, which isn't an option.*

Here is a **timeline of my professional life since graduation**.

**Background:** 

\-Graduated in 2017 with a major in Media Studies (focused in Advertising) and minors in both Marketing and Creative Writing. 

\-Had a few great internship opportunities, while still in school- one with a major media company (wound up not working out because I lived in Virginia and couldn't get to Los Angeles in the time span they gave me), and the other was a remote internship with a large online magazine, which I completed.

\-Graduated with honors, 3.3 Cumulative GPA and 3.6 Major GPA.

\-Was in long-term relationship (nearly 5 years) with guy whose graduation was pushed back a year, due to changing majors- meaning, he was staying in the college town and I would be too, seeing as we'd been living together for years.

**Timeline:**

***May 2017-*** Graduated

***Summer 2017-*** Worked at marketing internship w/ large restaurant chain in college town, in order to stay with boyfriend. 

***Fall 2017-*** Took a call center job, in order to make money while job hunting. Still doing this to stay with boyfriend. *Stupid decision.*

***December 2017-*** Could not find job. Got cheated on. Wound up quitting call center job, breaking up with boyfriend, and moving back in with parents.

***Winter 2018-*** Applied for full-time jobs, while working as a "temp" secretary (with some unofficial marketing work) at a real estate company, through a staffing agency.

***Spring 2018-*** Could not find a full-time marketing job, with so little experience. Was offered a full-time job with Real Estate company, a.k.a. "buyout" from staffing agency, so I would be an official employee, not a temp. Promised marketing/social media responsibilities. Decided to pursue this. Even submitted application and deposit for company-owned apartment next to office.

***May 2018-*** One manager turned out to be mentally unhinged. Stole my $250 deposit for the apartment, stole my SSN, and more. Upper management knew she had done this for days before reporting it to me. (Long story). I quit the job.

***June 2018-*** Got together with new boyfriend. Applied for marketing jobs, but was unsuccessful. Temp agency stopped working with me because I had called the authorities on my former employer for stealing from me. Basically said that their business w/ the company was more important than me.

***July 2018-*** Boyfriend got job with large tech company in Silicon Valley. I had always wanted to go to California and so had he, so we decided to take a leap of faith and go, despite me not having a job lined up. Stupid decision.

***August 2018-*** Moved to Cali. Had been applying and still was. No responses.

***Fall 2018-*** Job hunt unsuccessful. Even fast food places weren't hiring. Too many people, not enough jobs. Did not have a car, which lowered the radius I could travel and hurt my chances further. Went into crushing debt.

***Winter 2018-*** Went home alone for a month or so, to get my finances back under control. Applied for jobs.

***January 2019-*** Received job offer from startup in Silicon Valley. Accepted offer and returned to boyfriend in California.

***Winter/Spring 2019-*** Worked my a\*\* off for company, barely making anything ($20/hr in San Fran- no time and a half for overtime, which happened a lot). Started to notice some shifty things about them- paying me through Venmo-like app, no incoming revenue, etc. 

***May 2019-*** Found out from people "working for us" that they were being tricked into free labor. Tried to talk to employer to fix this and make company legitimate, but was shut down. Started applying for other jobs.

***Early July 2019-*** Startup tanking. People quitting left and right. Mental health rapidly declining. Received offer for a job a few states away, so I quit and moved with my boyfriend.

***Late July 2019-*** Got to new city after a long road trip. Called new employer to verify address and start time for first day that Monday. Found out that they had decided to hire an internal candidate at the last minute, and I was never informed. At this point, I'm in a new city and I'm homeless and unemployed.

***August 2019-*** Started working with local temp agency. Got good Marketing gig. Pay was low, but it was work. The contract was for one month, but they were planning on hiring me full-time after it ran out. Even had me write out a list of things I needed for the Marketing department for upcoming year, in order to get them approved during budget meetings. They were approved.

***September 2019-*** Received a phone call on one month anniversary of starting job. It was the temp agency. They said the company couldn't afford to hire me, so they were taking me off the position immediately and would find something else for me. I was devastated, but had no say. Contract said company couldn't work directly with me for a year after contract ended.

***Fall 2019-*** Temp agency could not find anything and basically ghosted. Unemployed, except for an odd job here or there. Broke. Crippling debt getting worse. Applying for jobs every day. Unsuccessful. Every marketing company that contacted me back was one of those MLM scam agencies, posing as legit businesses. 

***November 2019-*** Went home again for financial and health reasons. Kept applying for jobs.

***December 2019-*** Had a few interviews, but got turned down for a few things due to being home for the holidays. Finally got an offer for a phone sales role. I had little interest, but needed the income.

***March 2020-*** Have been working at new job since early January 2020. Pay is low. Hours are long. Metrics are unreasonable, and valued over actual productivity. Forced overtime with no pay. Employer won't even let us work from home during Coronavirus outbreak- despite having the tech to do so and confirmed/suspected cases among employees. I need to find a new job to transition into, once quarantine is over.

**So, here I am.** In the past, I've been told by hiring managers that my short-term assignments, lack of updated references, and resume gaps are red flags. I get that 100%. However, ever since graduating, I've been applying to crazy amounts of jobs each year and have been getting turned down due to lack of experience for 95% of those. Meanwhile, the jobs that have interviewed/ hired me have unfortunately been so easy to get a job with, or so it would appear, because they're not good companies to work for.

I am so set back in my life right now, all while desperately trying to get out of debt, get legal help for the cases that require it, and get my career started. I'm so depressed having to pay my student loans each month, despite not having worked one day in a full-time, salaried marketing role since finishing school.

&#x200B;

**What can I do (other than go to grad school), to get my career back on track?**

&#x200B;

**TL;DR:** Since graduation, I haven't been able to secure a good job due to lack of experience. The companies that have hired me have been terrible to work for, resulting in short employment periods, a lack of recent references, and lots of resume gaps. This is affecting my ability to get a good job in my field and I don't know how to turn things around. Please help.
