I console my mom after every rejection
Every time I get rejected (or accepted), my mom is sitting in the living room waiting for me to tell her how it went. And every time I get rejected/waitlisted, she becomes on the verge of tears. It's not like a typical Asian parent "my kid's a failure, what will I tell my friends whose kids got into MIT" kind of tears; it's a "my kid worked so hard and I really wanted him to be happy and get in" cry. Then I go over to her and assure her I'm not too sad so she feels better.

It's so sweet. I love my mom. Her reactions are far better than mine: she starts jumping and screaming when I get accepted. I wish I had made a "Mom college decision reaction" video because it's so funny and heartwarming to watch her react to my decisions.
