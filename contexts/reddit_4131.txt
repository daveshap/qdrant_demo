Great first date!
I (32/F) went out on a wholesome coffee date with a guy (33/M) from a dating app today and was pleasantly surprised that he checks off most of my boxes. 

After we had coffee, we went on a nature walk at one of my favorite parks, I caught the butterflies as we held hands as we watched birds and chatted. It was like a fairy tale. I don't want to brag too much to friends so I decided to post about it here.
