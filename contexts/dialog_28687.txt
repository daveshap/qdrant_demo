EPPS: I don't think the line will take the weight of a man and the coins. Wes!? We'll send the gold up, then me and Jaeger'll climb back.
WES: Ready when you are.
JAEGER: Wait.
EPPS: What?
EPPS: What?
JAEGER: We send the gold up what's to stop him from taking off and leaving us down here?
EPPS: He's not going to leave us.
JAEGER: What's to stop him if he wanted to? All he has to do is cut the line...
WES: You ready?
EPPS: All right. I'll go up, then you send up the gold and--
JAEGER: Why do I have to stay down here?
EPPS: Jesus, Jaeger.
JAEGER: I don't see how that plan's any better.
EPPS: Someone's got to send the gold up. It can't get on the line by itself.
