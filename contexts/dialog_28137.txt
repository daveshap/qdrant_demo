EMILY: What...?
LOMBARD: What... Some kind of organ factory... Pregnant girls doped up. Babies. There’s a lot of people back there. They’re holding a seminar. Trafficking’s the past, breeding the future...
LOMBARD: Friedman’s dead... They killed him...
EMILY: So who... Who’s the man? Where is he?
LOMBARD: Some Italian I picked up back there. He’s in the boot of the Mustang.
EMILY: Italian? The Mafia...?
LOMBARD: Who knows. Who cares... You wanted slime. You got slime.
LOMBARD: No one saw me but the Italian and a dog. I blew up their generator. They thought it was an accident but by now they must have realised one of their party is missing. It might make them feel insecure enough to decide to pack up...
EMILY: We’re both thinking the same thing, right?
LOMBARD: Do you know a friendly cop?
LOMBARD: Call from the motel and tell him if he moves fast enough there might be something left of a body dissolving in acid. Can I have the keys to your house?
EMILY: That-that won’t do. That’s not the way it goes. You saw it, you tell it, that’s the way...
LOMBARD: I’m finished here and I’m tired, Emily. You shouldn’t be here. Now don’t make it worse.
EMILY: A seminar in a baby breeding farm! Bodies in acid! You think I’ll get anywhere with that? Jesus! With luck I might raise a laugh. They might even send a patrol car to check the place out. Whatever, it’ll be too late.
LOMBARD: Then find another way.
EMILY: Look! Either you talk or the creeps are gonna walk. For god’s sake. What am I supposed to say? I got this from a French guy from England who broke in there to have a chat with an Austrian child trafficker? Is that it?
