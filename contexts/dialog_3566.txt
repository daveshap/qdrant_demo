JOHN: What was that?
YURI: Oh nothing.
JOHN: Tell me.
YURI: No. It is too judgmental.
JOHN: Tell me what he said.
YURI: He says why did you send to Russia for a wife.
YURI: You are not ashamed of it? It's no surprise to want to love.
JOHN: No. It's not that.
YURI: Do you believe in love?
JOHN: I suppose it's... I mean define your terms.
YURI: It's very strange. How many people are truly themselves with their love? It is the greatest human disaster and it is never in the newspapers. There are no Marches Against Heartache, no Ministries Against Loneliness, no Concerts Against Disappointment. We look away. And still we know in secret that nothing is more important to us. The one thing we all share but don't say. Look John I will show you something.
