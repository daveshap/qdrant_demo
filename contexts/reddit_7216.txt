Customers at the retail store I work at were leaving without paying. Is it my fault or managements’?
Hey, to give you a lil bit of background, I’m a college graduate who has fallen on hard times. I was fired from my previous office job and have taken a retail job in the meantime until I find something better.

I started work as a cashier three days ago. I was shown a thirty minute video for training then put straight on to the registers. We would have customers pick up online orders. We retrieve the items for them and hand them to the customers.

Well, there’s a receipt attached to the items ordered online. I didn’t think much of it. On my third day, I was scolded by my manager for almost letting a woman leave with the attached receipt. He told me to never let them leave with the receipt, and that by not having a manager scan the accompanying receipt, the customer never pays for it as the system only has the customer pay once it knows that they have left the store.

So I basically let hundreds of dollars worth of merchandise out of the store, without the customer paying. I was honest with my manager about it and let him know that this needs to be made clear to all of the new store associates.

Later that night, I told my coworker the story and she said that she did the same exact thing the first few days she worked there. She only found out about it on her third day there, just like I did.

Is this managements fault or mine?
