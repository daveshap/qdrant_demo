Disable user intervention until password entered (not logout) I'm looking for an option to turn user input off (so to say enable read-only mode) leaving the same picture on screen without logging out from the system, but requiring password to be entered to continue doing something.For example, I want to turn on a movie and then lock the system against any action. So if I need to leave the room my friends wouldn't be able to do anything with my laptop, just watch the movie till the end.
