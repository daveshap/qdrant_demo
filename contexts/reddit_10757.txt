Mom just basically told me to go to hell and she’s not listening to me anymore. Next time the house is free I am going to prepare me suicide method. This is it I’m finally taking the next step. What a fucking horrible way to treat someone you know is suicidal.
EDIT: A lot of comments are abusing my mom and saying to cut her off. She cares for me but she had left me crying and hadn’t literally said ‘go to hell’. I used that term perhaps colloquially and she basically told me that she isn’t sticking around to listen to me and stick around to hear me refuse to do anything. She merely left me alone in my room to hurt while she went to make dinner for my brother or whatever. I apologize to those who took it literally. Bad communication on my part
