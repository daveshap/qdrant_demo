TERRY: Did you ever see a dolphin?
DIANE: Sure. They like to play. We may see some today.
TERRY: Great!
TERRY: Whoops, almost lost one. Can't play with the dolphins without skis....
DIANE: Ready?
TERRY: Hang on, hang on...Okay, go.
TINA: Take a break for a minute, okay?
ED: Huh?
TINA: Eddie, can we do that? Can we go skiing? We can use my Uncle's boat. Eddie?
ED: Next week.
TINA: With you, everything's next week. I want to go skiing soon. Tomorrow?
