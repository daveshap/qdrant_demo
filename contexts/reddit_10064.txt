How long does it generally take for a job to be posted after someone resigns?
This might be more of a Human Resources question, but I'm just wondering if anyone here could answer this question. I was informed about 3 weeks ago that a job would be posted soon as an employee had recently resigned. I've been checking the job boards regularly, but this job has yet to be posted. Is this normal? Or should I assume that the job will no longer be posted?
