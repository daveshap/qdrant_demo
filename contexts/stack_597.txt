How to hide \"quodlibet wants to inhibit shortcuts\" message Ever since upgrading to 17.10, whenever I click on the time elapsed bar in quodlibet (to manually change the current track playback time), I get a warning message that says \"Quod Libet wants to inhibit shortcuts. You can restore shortcuts by pressing Shift+Ctrl+Escape.\" There are \"Deny\" and \"Allow\" buttons, but neither appear to do anything useful, and the message pops up every single time I click on the bar. It's quite annoying. How can I get around this? I honestly don't care if it's just hiding the message or automatically picking one or the other option.I didn't post this to the quodlibet issue tracker since this seems to be an OS matter, not an application-specific problem. Of course, I could be wrong, but I figured it best to start here.
