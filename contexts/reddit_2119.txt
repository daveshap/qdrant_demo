why tf do you have to pay to send scores
It says on the page it is a damn electronic report. Why do I have to pay if they're basically sending a fucking email to the school with my stupid scores that I already paid $50+ for each of them? WHY TF DO THEY NEED 14 BUSINESS DAYS TO SEND A STUPID ELECTRONIC REPORT? IS THERE FUCKIGN TRAFFIC ON THE INTERNET OR SOMETHING? FUck. Also Fuck schools that don't allow you to self report. Honestly I should put "entering my credit card details on college boards website" as an ec on my common app. FUcK.
