BLAIR: Goodbye, Paul.
AARON: Take care, Paul. It takes a certain kind of courage for you to say that in front of the President of the News Division.
BLAIR: You think anyone who's proud of the work we do is an ass kisser.
AARON: No. I think anyone who puckers their lips and presses it against his boss' buttocks and then smooches is an ass kisser.
BLAIR: My gosh, and for a while there, I was attracted to you.
