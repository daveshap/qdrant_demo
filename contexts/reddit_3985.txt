Am I a dick for thinking like this....
So I'm(24m) sort of seeing this girl(19f) and I like her, I get along with her and I really enjoy spending time with her, but she's a bigger girl, I have dated bigger girls in the past but they where always working on themselves at the same time.
I do want to say I am sexualy attracted to her in the sense of what she does and can do and I'm emotionally attracted to her but I'm only a little physically attractived to her, I have said that we should go for a walk when I'm with her so we can get out of the house and walk her dog. Am I seeming like I'm not happy with her weight by suggesting to do some activitys outside or is it fine to suggest it. Is this normal with some couples out there?
