I’m done.
I’m done.

I don’t know why today is the day that broke the camels back, but I feel like bursting into tears. By all standards my life should be great. Loving parents, amazing spouse, Good in-laws, good paying job, nice new home, stable friends, and no major health problems. But I just sit here and writhe in emotional pain, I feel like driving my truck into a concrete barrier. 

I’m an adult. What could I possibly be sad about?

I tell people around me I don’t feel right, like how I’m abnormally stressed, anxious, or sad. Everyone dismisses me. Not a rude way but, in a manner like “hey man we all feel that way sometimes.” My loved ones around me feels so needy, like if I were to hand off an ounce of my pain it would shatter them. I sit here and smile, do my best to join in on the conversation and not draw undue attention to myself.

My day to day job is being a Doctor, I get to help people and it makes me feel like I have purpose. But it’s not enough. I try to save money, not spend too much on myself, donate to others. But it’s not enough. I try to enjoy little hobbies, get outside, play with my dog, spend time with my friends.  But it’s not enough. 

I still feel sad.

I reach out on forums for depression and ask “do I have a problem?” “Is it normal to feel this way?” And not even the masses have comments for me. I don’t want to commit suicide because I would feel too responsible for the pain and mess I left behind. But if I was told tomorrow is my last day, I don’t think I would fight it much. I feel like help only comes if you do something dramatic. It makes me appreciate how brave people are for reaching out for help. Posting this is the best I can do. I’m not sure if anyone will read this, but if you do, thank you.
