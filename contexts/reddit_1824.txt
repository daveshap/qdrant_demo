Through highschool, I never really thought about college apps when choosing classes, activities, and extracurriculars.
I absolutely refuse to regret that, no matter what happens with my college apps. 

I might not have done my absolute best in every class, but I worked damn hard, and I'm still proud of my effort and achievement. I just finished the last show of my last fall play, I refuse to regret doing play instead of robotics team or something more "relevant" to my major. I absolutely love being a part of theater and the people I acted with. I play bass and guitar, but I'm not that good. I'm not in a band or anything. I don't care. I've grown in my abilities so much over the past few years, and I love playing at church. I love listening to music and playing video games, and even though I can't put that on an app, those things are still valuable to me. 

I want to get into Carnegie Mellon. I love that campus and that school's atmosphere. Even if I don't get in, I refuse to beat myself up over not being the perfect student. I made the choices I made, and I know I'll have a great time in college even if I end up going Pitt.
