SCHIKANEDER: Look, you little clown, do you know how many people I've hired for you? Do you know how many people are waiting?
CONSTANZE: Leave him alone!
SCHIKANEDER: I'm paying these people. Do you realize that?
CONSTANZE: He's doing his best.
SCHIKANEDER: I'm paying people just to wait for you. It's ridiculous!
CONSTANZE: You know what's ridiculous? Your libretto, that's what's ridiculous. Only an idiot would ask Wolfi to work on that stuff!
SCHIKANEDER: Oh yes? And what's so intelligent about writing a Requiem?
CONSTANZE: Money! Money!
SCHIKANEDER: You're mad! She's mad, Wolfi.
CONSTANZE: Oh yes, and who are you? He's worked for Kings. For the Emperor. Who are you?
