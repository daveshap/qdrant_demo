Someone on r/PersonalFinance when I said that my husband and I eat quite well on $50/week for all our food. So, I threw together an album of our family's go-to recipes that we've compiled over the generations. I thought you guys might enjoy it.
*scoffed at me. Dang it, why can't you edit titles ðŸ˜­

Some of them are in my grandmother's handwriting or have weird terms (she used to always say "Oleo", brand name margarine, but now we just use butter). If you have trouble reading or understanding any of these, please give a shout and I'd be happy to explain!

EDIT: u/francoboy7 was kind enough to enhance the recipes in a printable format in case any of you want to save yourselves the trouble of writing  these down longform.
