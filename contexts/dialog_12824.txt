BURNS: No -- I was just talking to one of the guys at the office.
BRUCE: Oh. I wonder what's keeping mother? She was supposed to come down and get you.
HILDY: Oh, she was here.
BRUCE: Where'd she go?
HILDY: Out some place.
BRUCE: Hildy! Where's mother?
HILDY: Oh -- mother -- she -- I don't know where she went.
BRUCE: Did you give her the money?
HILDY: No, I was going to give it to her -- but she left hurriedly.
BRUCE: Then suppose you give me the money. Four hundred and fifty dollars.
HILDY: Oh, yes. Here it is.
HILDY: Here it is, Bruce. One -- two -- three -- four hundred -- and fifty dollars.
BRUCE: Thank you.
BRUCE: And I'll take that certified check, too. I've decided I can handle things around here...
BURNS: Come on, Hildy, we've got to keep going! Sorry, Bruce, but --
HILDY: Just a second, Walter. Here, Bruce, here's the check... And, oh, Bruce, here's your wallet. I got it back.
BRUCE: You got it back, eh? There's something funny going on around here.
BURNS: Hildy!
HILDY: All right, Walter.
BRUCE: I'm taking the nine o'clock train, Hildy. And you can meet us at the station.
HILDY: Fine.
BURNS: I'll see she's there, Bruce, I promise you.
BRUCE: If she's not there, mother and I are leaving anyhow!
BURNS: I know how you feel, Bruce, but you've got to forgive her. She's only a woman, after all.
BRUCE: Suppose she is -- I have feelings, too! Do you know where I've been for the last couple of hours? Locked up in a police station and she didn't move to do anything about it.
BURNS: Ts! Ts! Ts!
BRUCE: And now I don't know where my mother is. She may be lost.
BURNS: I'll find her, Bruce, if I have to put every detective in the city on the job. Tell you what -- go over to the Missing Persons Bureau and describe your mother. What does she look like?
BRUCE: She's -- well, she's very motherly. That's about the best description I know.
BURNS: That's the kind of stuff they want!
BURNS: Oh, Bruce, let me see that money Hildy gave you.
BRUCE: The money? Why?
BURNS: There's a lot of counterfeit big bills going around.
BRUCE: Gee! Take a look, will you?
BURNS: Oh, this is all right, Bruce. I just wanted to be sure.
BRUCE: Say, I want to be sure, too!
