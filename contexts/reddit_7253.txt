trade school or accelerated training ?
I am currently in taking apprentice classes in both HVAC and Res Electric, first year for each. My school offers a 10 month "accelerated program" in New Home Construction. 

&#x200B;

1. The Apprentice classes are 2 days a week, 3 hours a day for each with light hands on training in the shop. 
2. The accelerated program is 5 days a week, 6 or 7 hours at an off site location, hands on training at a Habitat for Humanity home construction site.

My issue with the apprentice classes are that they are PAINFULLY SLOW. I am switching careers, not starting school for the first time. I have a degree and worked in the corporate world for a few years and then decided to switch and pursue work in the trades. I am not working currently and living at home in order to take these classes, and to find work in the field after time, I am 28 years old. 

The appeal of the accelerated program is time it takes to complete and the almost 100% hands on training. 

The con of the accelerated program is that its not specialized, not plumbing or HVAC or Electric or finish work, its all ruff labor work, putting up frames/roofs ect. and its 5x the tuition... 

Will working in home construction LEAD to specialization and/or good skills or would I basically be busting myself for a quick career that wont have too much progression ?

Anyone here work or have worked in rough home building? did it teach you anything that you used to progress to bigger and better things? did it open doors? 

Has anyone here worked as a tech in electric or Hvac or something else? Did you wish you started off with something different or are you glad you went the specialized route ?
