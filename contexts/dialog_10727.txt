ENID: Will you get off my back for once?
DAD: It's tough to find a good job without any kind of training.
ENID: Look, I told you I'm not going to college.
DAD: Well, I think it's good to keep all your options open. You can always enroll for the winter quarter. You could even live here and go to the city college part time, and still get a job if you wanted to.
ENID: Look at me -- I'm not even listening to a word you're saying.
DAD: Did I tell you who I ran into at the bagel place?
ENID: Who?
DAD: Guess.
ENID: How should I know?
DAD: Someone from the past.
ENID: Who?
DAD: Give up?
ENID: YES.
DAD: Maxine.
ENID: Not the Maxine?
DAD: Yup.
ENID: God, how horrifying.
REBECCA: ...you don't have to make a million dollars -- just get any stupid job so we can at least start looking for an apartment.
ENID: I wonder if I hang around with you because you're like my surrogate mother figure or something. Like I have this subconscious biological need to be nagged and bitched at constantly.
REBECCA: You hang out with me because nobody else can stand to be around you.
ENID: Or maybe... did you ever think that deep down we really might be lesbos? Maybe that's why we spend so much time together.
REBECCA: You're gross. See that guy?
ENID: Which one?
REBECCA: He gives me a total boner!
ENID: He's like the biggest idiot of all time!
