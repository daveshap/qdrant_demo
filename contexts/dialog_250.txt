ELAINE: Look, spare me the macho bullshit about your gun...
CATES: Bullshit? I'll tell you about bullshit. My gun's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it. It isn't my macho bullshit that's killing people, my gun is ...
ELAINE: Look, Jack, if you make everything your personal responsibility, you'll turn into a bad cop. It's not a practical way to function...
CATES: I didn't get burned, two cops did. Listen, I'll tell you about personnel responsibility. I like to get the job done right. And if I don't get my job done right... I'm for shit.
ELAINE: Here it comes again ... the sacred job...
CATES: That's right. I'm not like you. I'm not gonna sit on my ass wondering what's right and what's wrong... There's a psycho out there killing people with my gun and I'm gonna get him. Because it's my job. And if you don't get that...
ELAINE: I get that. The job first. Everything else, especially me, second. I get it. I don't like it.
