MR. FEUR: I'm running late here. I just came back for my briefcase.
CLAIRE: Right. Well, I wanted to stop by to welcome you to the uh, to the neighborhood. I'm Claire Spencer. From next door.
MR. FEUR: This really isn't a good time.
CLAIRE: Well maybe your wife...
MR. FEUR: She isn't here.
CLAIRE: When...when will she be back?
MR. FEUR: I don't know.
CLAIRE: Oh-kay...
MR. FEUR: I have to go.
