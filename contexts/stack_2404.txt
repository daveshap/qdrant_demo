Adding contour line to heatmap in QGIS? I use QGIS 2.18.14I import csv file with hits on a certain area. I then create a simple indicative heatmap (properties > heatmap).Can I add contour lines to this heatmap and if yes, how?I also put a vector grid on these hits > count points in polygon and then via properties > graduated based number of hits per square.Can I add contour lines to this square based heat map and if yes, how?
