I hate who I am and where I am
I'm gay. I'm ridiculously gay. You know that person in the class who everyone knows is gay? Yeah, I'm that person. I would love to be open about it, but I live in a shithole of a country which is religious and homophobic as fuck. I'm scared and scared for a reason. 

I told my mom that I'm bi (small lie) a couple of years ago. She got angry and we never talked about it again. Can't imagine telling my dad or anyone else.

This atmosphere is sufficating me. I literally feel out of breath from time to time. There is constant pressure on my chest.

I also think I'm in a deep depression and I can't go to a psychiatrist because of the freaking social stigma. I need to travel to a different city and pay by cash to cover it up but I don't feel like I have the energy to seek help. 

I'm up in the middle of the night just crying.
