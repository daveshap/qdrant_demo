PLISSKEN: How do you know all this?
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE: I used to represent the guy who invented it. I swear to God, Snake. No bullshit.
HERSHE: So what's the deal, gorgeous?
PLISSKEN: We get the girl and the prototype. And we get out.
SPINAL: All of us?
PLISSKEN: Yeah.
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE: Me too?
PLISSKEN: We'll see.
HERSHE: Why should we leave? I love L.A. Where we gonna go? What's the payoff?
SPINAL: I'd like to get out but I don't have enough money.
PLISSKEN: The President's promised to give whoever helps me 1 million dollars.
SPINAL: Yeah? Greenbacks? I got ten million of them.
PLISSKEN: Uh-uh. Bluebacks.
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE: Aw, come on, Snake.
PLISSKEN: Bluebacks. I'm not bullshittin'. I swear to God.
HERSHE: I don't know, sounds thin to me.
PLISSKEN: You want to stay here, while Cuervo Jones rules the world?
HERSHE: No, that sucks. How are we getting out?
PLISSKEN: I don't know yet.
SPINAL: Shit.
HERSHE: You always were a loser, Plissken. Makin' things up as you go along. That's why I cut out on you in Cleveland. You're just a bum like the rest of us.
