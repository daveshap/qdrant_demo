I'm (M26) going to start taking myself on dates.
After the letdowns and false hopes and waste of time I get from online dating, I decided I am going to take myself on dates from now on. I deleted all my dating apps and bought single tickets to a local TEDx talk and a concert that I'm really interested in.

For all the times we try to take someone on a fun date or adventure and they end up either not being into it or things just fizzle out, when is the last time you took yourself out? I know that other people who go to these things have the same interests. Without a date you're pretty much free to talk to whoever you want and just share the experience.

I'm just excited to be making myself a priority instead of constantly trying to think about some girl I matched with or wishing things had gone better with a date. It's easy to ignore the good things in life so for anyone else struggling, try looking up some local events and just go. Go with no expectations and just focus on enjoying yourself.

Be strong y'all.
