I have a Masters Degree and just got a No from a job where a college degree is “preferred but not required”. What the hell am I supposed to do?
I’ve reworked my resume, I tailor my cover letter and resume to the position, and I can’t even get an interview for a position where a college degree isn’t even required? I’ve applied to at least a hundred places and have only had one interview (whom I haven’t heard from in a few weeks). I have 2 years of relevant work experience and I am having absolutely no luck. I’m three weeks out of a job and am desperate. Am I doing something wrong?
