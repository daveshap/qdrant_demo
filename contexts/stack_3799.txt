Interest rate control variable GARCH I'm building a GARCH model which looks if analysts' reports affect the volatility of certain stocks. I was wondering if it would be logical to include the interest rate in my GARCH model as a sort of control variable for macroeconomic changes.Maybe a change in volatility doesn't come from the report per se, but underlying changes in monetary policy for instance.Any help is appreciated!
