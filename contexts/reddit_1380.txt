Last night I went to a club alone (and loved it). A few years ago I could barely leave the house.
Saw online that an artist I listen to was gonna be DJing at a club near me. The music is quite underground (techno/lofi house) and none of my friends are really into it. On a whim I thought 'fuck it' and bought a ticket.

Went to it last night. Music was blaring, place was busy af. There are I am, dancing and just feeling the music, not caring about what anybody thinks. While I was there it dawned on me that a few years ago I could barely leave the house without being ridden with anxiety/panic.

I hope this post gives some people hope :)

Also I'm just really happy to be where I am today, looking back on how I used to be.
