HAWKEYE: Hi, Ho-Jon. How they goin'?
HO-JON: Finest kind. Captain Forrests say you better haul ass home quick. We got new chest-cutter in our tent.
DUKE: Now I got you for a witness, I'm going to try again. So far all I dragged out of him is he's from Bahston and he's only been in the Army two months. Where were you when they drafted you?
TRAPPER: Home.
DUKE: I mean, what were you doing? Were you a resident or on a staff someplace?
TRAPPER: That's right.
DUKE: Where?
TRAPPER: Hospital.
DUKE: Which hospital?
TRAPPER: Back home.
DUKE: Is there any reason why we shouldn't know the name of it?
TRAPPER: No. Or why you should.
HAWKEYE: I think I've seen this nut somewhere. Haven't I?
TRAPPER: If you don't know what you've seen, why should I?
