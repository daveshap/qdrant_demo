Can there be a secret ballot software in a membership-based community? There is an online membership community. Every member has the ssh key that they use to perform various functions.There is the need to vote on sensitive issues. Members don't want to disclose their votes, only want them to be securely counted. Members don't want to trust a human to do this.Can there be a computer program that can accept votes from members without the possibility of easy tampering and disclosure?I imagine it the way that every member can connect with the ssh key, perform some operation like answer a voting question, the system will change its state and record the vote, but will be only able to tell the final count after the minimum number of votes is counted and the voting is closed, and won't theoretically be able to tell individual answers.I imagine that there should be some cryptographic algorithm that can do this.
