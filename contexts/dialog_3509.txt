BRANDT: They called about eighty minutes ago. They want you to take the money and drive north on the 4 5. They'll call you on the portable phone with instructions in about forty minutes. One person only or I'd go with you. They were very clear on that: one person only. What happened to your jaw?
DUDE: Oh, nothin', you know.
BRANDT: Here's the money, and the phone. Please, Dude, follow whatever instructions they give.
DUDE: Uh-huh.
BRANDT: Her life is in your hands.
DUDE: Oh, man, don't say that..
BRANDT: Mr. Lebowski asked me to repeat that: Her life is in your hands.
DUDE: Shit.
BRANDT: Her life is in your hands, Dude. And report back to us as soon as it's done.
