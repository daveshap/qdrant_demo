NARCISSUS: Take your hands off me animal!
PROXIMO: Chain him.
PROXIMO: Sorry but I have to get at least one fight out of you otherwise I won't even get back the cost of the bribe I had to pay the arena slaves to get you here. I know what you're trying to do: kill yourself and trust in the Roman tradition of justice that the emperor will let your family survive and keep their lands. The only thing you have accomplishes is to prove you're a very important individual. You make me feel good about my investment! And that puking pig Jerses -- he won't even discuss you. Both of you have clamped mouths! But I love all my fighters -- I'll find out about your family. And about you. That I promise.
NARCISSUS: I refuse to be your slave. I refuse --
PROXIMO: -- to fight? We'll see...
