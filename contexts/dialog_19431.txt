CABBIE: Where to, sir?
GENE: The Bonaventure. The Bonaventure Hotel. Do you know where that is?
CABBIE: Amtrack?
GENE: What?
CABBIE: You just come in on Amtrack?
GENE: Uh, yes..
CABBIE: Business or pleasure?
GENE: Business.
CABBIE: Where'd you come from?
GENE: San Diego.
CABBIE: Oh, San Diego? I've thought about moving to San Diego. It's hard to make a living in this town. These short hops. Can't make a dime on 'em. To LAX, Pasadena, then I can make a buck. These little hops cost me money.
GENE: Sorry.
CABBIE: 'S okay. What do you think?
GENE: Huh?
CABBIE: Better in San Diego? More opportunity there? What?
GENE: I really don't know. I don't live there. I was just visiting...a grave.
CABBIE: Aw, too bad.
CABBIE: Somebody close?
GENE: What?
CABBIE: The grave. Somebody close?
