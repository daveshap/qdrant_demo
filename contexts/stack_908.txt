Can't Use Wireless Brother Printer (2270DW) Ubuntu 18.04 I can't get my Brother HL 2270 DW printer to work wirelessly in 18.04, from a clean install on a Dell XPS 13 9360. I've tried for hours, days, using all the methods I can find in various forums, including going through CUPS, installing the Brother drivers via the terminal. Even worse, I don't know what IPP means, or DHCP, or PPD, or CUPS. It's pretty excruciating, as I increasingly find Linux to be, after having children and not having anymore the spare hours to find solutions for simple things. (Apologies for expressing frustration!).I reset the network on the printer, can print via USB connection, but even when I get the printer to appear in my DHCP client list (via TPLink router), I can't ping it from my PC.Any advice for an ignoramus?
