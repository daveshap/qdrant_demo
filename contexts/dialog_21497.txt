FEZZIK: You've been mostly dead all day.
INIGO: We had Miracle Max make a pill to bring you back.
WESTLEY: Who are you? -- Are we enemies? Why am I on this wall? -- Where's Buttercup? --
INIGO: Let me explain -- -- No, there is too much. Let me sum up. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 99.
INIGO: Buttercup is marrying Humperdinck in a little less than half an hour, so all we have to do is get in, break up the wedding, steal the Princess, make our escape after I kill Count Rugen.
WESTLEY: That doesn't leave much time for dilly dallying.
