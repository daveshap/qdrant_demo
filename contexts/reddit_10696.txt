My dog just passed away
I started considering to end it all a little while ago, when im drunk i have the strongest wish to do it

Then, i remember my parents, even if they love me for the sake of social norm, i have those two with me, i couldn’t bare to make them suffer like that, especially my dad, who loves his family the most

Currently (me, 23, my mom, 57, my dad 59) we had a dog, she was so loved and well treated, she was so smart, dad and i loved her like it was my little sister, my dad relied so much on her emotionally

Long story short, she got run over, we got her treated, this morning we found her dead

I already had serious depression, family is already struggling to bind itself, ive got no interest at all with nothing or nobody, i already had fear, about loneliness, about my father, and now i fear even more, i fear that he will age more quickly, that he will not fulfill his obligations, we could lose our house, i fear that he will die soon too, if he dies i swear i kill myself in the moment

I have already lurked and sadly, posted here 

I know i will not kill myself now, so if any of you wasted time reading this rn, please go help more critical people

I just don’t have anyone to tell this, to tell my problems, yo relief what I feel, and just wanted to note this somewhere

Im just convinced more and more and more to the point im 99% sure that i will have myself killed on some point, i just want to die but also im concerned about my dad and i have plenty of fear
