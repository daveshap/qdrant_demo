To my fellow black women who have ever felt like they are the "bottom of the pile," you are electric.
I get legitimately sad whenever I see or talk to other black women who detail their experiences with dating as extremely negative. I get sad when they mention how their experiences have them internalizing negative notions about their skin color, hair, body, intelligence, etc.

To my fellow black/dark-skinned women, you are electric.

Reclaim your self-image. 

Reclaim your confidence. 

Don't let this asinine world of dating be the final determinant in how you see yourself and all that you have to give. 

You are smart, clever, and any other positive attribute that you've wanted to claim for yourself against naysayers.

And you're worthy of a relationship that is just as electric as you are.

(as is everyone, but this post is for the black girls)
