Does the writing get easier? Writing resources?
I just started Winter Cohort for graduate school. I finished my undergraduate in 2012. I feel absolutely like a fish out of water. I'm doing the academic writing course and I feel as if I can't even string two sentences together properly. I just threw together papers in undergrad and now the level of writing and understanding the complexities of graduate level writing seem so overwhelming. 

Does it get easier? Are there any free online grad level writing resources anyone recommends.
