VADER: What is thy bidding, My Master?
EMPEROR: There is a grave disturbance in The Force.
VADER: I have felt it.
EMPEROR: Our situation is most precarious. We have a new enemy who could bring about our destruction.
VADER: Our destruction? Who?
EMPEROR: The son of Skywalker. You must destroy him ... or he will be our undoing.
VADER: He's not a Jedi, he's just a boy. Obi-wan could not have taught him so much that ...
EMPEROR: You are weak! I have seen it. The Force is strong with him. He must be destroyed.
VADER: But, if he could be turned, he would be a powerful ally.
EMPEROR: Yes ... yes. That would be a great asset.
VADER: He will join us or die, My Master.
