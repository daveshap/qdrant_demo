I just feel trapped
Sorry if this feels all over the place, I'm just adding as I remember.
Also looked back and see it's a wall of text, apologies.

I grew up in a somewhat dysfunction Asian family.

- i grew up being bullied for my eyes as I have a lazy eyelid, leading to one eye being "larger" than the other, I would try to be friends with people but they would shun me and tell me to fuck off in little kid terms. Eventually after moving to a different school ( I went through multiple elementary schools due to some of the reasons below) I made some friends and it was enjoyable. My met my best mate Ryan who would about 15 years later, would kill himself. My group of friends stayed the same from elementary and would expand upon highschool and this is when Ryan would start to drift away. He had family problems of his own and he would attend school less and less over time. I still course myself for not reaching out as I thought he was doing ok, I started attending university this is when I learned he killed himself.

- my father was an alcoholic and being Asian, beatings weren't uncommon as punishment. There was a time when my mother, sister and I stayed at a relative's place for a night or two when my father was drunk enough that he fell over, injured his head, and wasn't in the sanest of conditions.

- my brother died when I was in grade 3 from some medical illness which I still have no idea what it was as I was never told and never asked as my mother suffered immensely from his death and I don't want to bring any of that back. Some of my early grade school classes would have daily diaries where you would write about stuff that happened daily, just writing practice I suppose. There was a day where I wrote about how my brother recently passed and how I would be attending his funeral very soon. My teacher read this and let me know that she was there for me etc. This soon made it to my sister who was about 5 grades above me but still in the same school building. Her teacher asked her about the funeral and I don't know what she said in response. Later at home, she told my parents about how I told my teacher about my brother dying and now the teacher(s) knew
 They berated me, telling game how such personal details should be kept between family and not be told to others. Perhaps this is where I started to feel betrayed by my own family and learned not to tell my family anything as I would just get shit on for sharing.

- my mother and father divorced while I was pretty young and while my father doesn't mention my mother when I see him, if something goes wrong such as my mother misplacing a document, she would blame either me or my sister for "letting him into the house". She would assume things such as him stealing documents that she misplaced. There are memories of when I was young, I would wait for my mother to come home from the hospital from visiting my brother and I would come downstairs to see her
 She would hold me and cry to me about my sick brother.

- my mother soon started dating again and I remember that she was dating 2 guys at once I think. Some lawyer guy and some other guy she met at work. She asked me which one I liked better and not to tell the Guy A about the existence of Guy B. I didn't know what was really going on as I was still in early grade school at this point but it was only in the past couple years I realised that my mom was essentially seeing two guys at once.

- my sister is doing great, she has a good job and married last year, has good friends, great husband and such. I'm genuinely happy for her she was the first in my family to graduate university and prosper.

- My parents work in a factory and immigrated over from China so this was huge. I'm similarly trying to graduate and my family set me up for success. My father gave me money for university fees but I spent about 40% on dumb crap like amazon items or games as I was about 18 at the time, and it's not like I grew up learning how to manage my finances, I was and still am young and stupid. I started to run out of money and had to take some time off university to work to make money. I told my parents who I was living with that I needed a break. If I had told them the truth they would have looked at me like a pathetic human being which I am but..... I wouldn't have been able to take it. They accepted my lie and so I found a job and worked. 

Eventually I went back to university and resumed my course work but they expect me to graduate at the end of this semester which isn't possible with the course work I'm still missing but with the lies I've told them, it makes sense why they would think I would graduate. My situation is entirely my fault and I don't know what to fucking do. 

To top it all off, I play far too many video games as it's my escape. Recently, my grandma died on my father's side, and when my sister called to tell me, I was still playing video games as an escape. She could hear me playing and told me to "get your shit together, grandma just died and you don't give a shit". I do, I just can't express emotion anymore, not to my family after all that's happened. She told my mother and she similarly thinks I'm a human bag of garbage at this point. And I honestly don't blame them. My sister told me once that I am the source of problems in the family and she's not wrong. I agree with her, and it makes me feel all the more shitty because of the truth behind it.

Some of my cousins are similarly in university and they're doing great. A bunch of my friends have graduated and are living their best lives and I'm happy for them. I just see how I'm stuck in my position because of my own actions and I feel absolutely miserable. 

There's more I can write out but it's already a large wall of text.

My university has counselling services I can use but it's fucking worthless when you trying to make an appointment and there's a waitlist..........

I can't even get a job relevant to my degree during university as I don't have co-op. All job listings I've seen for internships list having a GPA of 3.0 minimum and I hovering around a 69% average which is about a GPA of 1.33. I can't get a job without experience and I can't get experience without a job, and my decreasing GPA certainly doesn't help as I can't even stick my foot in the door.

I just don't want to be alive anymore. I just want it all to stop. If I kill myself my family will likely be sad for a bit, but being a source of problems they would also likely be better off in the long run if I'm not around.
