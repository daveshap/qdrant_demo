WURLITZER: Well, just what the hell do you expect me to do?
WAYNE: Lose 'em.
WURLITZER: Mr. Gayle, do you have the slightest idea how dangerous Knox is?
WAYNE: Mr. Wurlitzer, I assure you, I am very familiar with Mickey Knox's career.
WURLITZER: Since he and his wife have been in custody, they've killed---
WAYNE: Don't recite the fact to me. I'm sure I know 'em better than you do.
WURLITZER: Well, let me let you in on one more fact you obviously don't know. If I were to take my men away, Mickey Knox would snap your neck like a twig.
WAYNE: One...I can take care of myself. I grew up in a tough neighbourhood, and I've handled some pretty rough customers in my day. Mickey Knox doesn't scare me. Two...I'm a journalist, and I'm prepared to take that risk. Three...it ain't gonna happen. Believe me when I tell you, it is in Mickey Knox's own best interest to play this game according to Hoyle. Wait a minute. We've gotten into a advisory relationship here, which is not what I want. But seriously, Phil, look at this.
WAYNE: We got one...two...three...four ...five...six...seven...eight. I mean Jesus Christ, Phil, that's too much. Let's lose some of these guys.
WURLITZER: Wayne, if it was anybody else---
WAYNE: Phil, I'm just scared he's gonna clam up on me with all these sheriffs all over the place. They hate him. He hates them. What kinda intimacy am I gonna create with all this hate in the air. Even you and I feel it.
WURLITZER: What are we talking about?
WAYNE: Two guys?
WURLITZER: Okay. I'll take two guys off.
WAYNE: No, no, no, no, no, no, I mean only two guys.
WURLITZER: I can't do that. Five guys.
WAYNE: Three.
WURLITZER: I'll cut it in half. Four guys, but that's it.
