My dad is heartbroken because I accepted a job 100 miles away.
**EDIT: The title should say 1000 miles away. Sorry about that..**

I am a 24 year old woman and I have been looking for a full time job in the creative field since i graduated from college last year. I also have been wanting to move somewhere new and see and experience more of the world. I've lived in Tennessee my whole life and I've never experienced living somewhere completely new and different. Just to the next town over for school. My boyfriend moved a thousand miles away for grad school, and we don't want to do long distance anymore. I got an offer at a company I really like where he is that is perfect for me. I accepted it today, and I have to be there on Monday. So it's pretty quick.

I told my dad about the job offer today and that I would be going, and he's really upset about it. My father is very traditional in that he grew up in a rural area where most people don't move more than a few miles from home after they get married and start a family. I've been taught my whole life that family and the farm we grew up is pretty much the most important thing on earth. Family sticks together and stays together.

He went to the same college 50 miles from where he grew up (and where I grew up). After he graduated, instead of moving to where he could have gotten an engineering career started, he moved home and helped his parents run the family business. And he got married, had a family and never left. He claims he has no regrets he chose to move home to take care of his parents. He felt it was his duty and privilege to do so and be there every day. (They both passed away over ten years ago.)

We are very alike in many ways, and he expected I would do exactly what he did with his life. But I've gotten an urge to go somewhere new and see the world. I am almost 25 and I want more out of life than the family business and family farm. I went to the same college he did and graduated and had to move home a few months after due to being unable to find a job in my field. Now he wants me to carry on the business and use my skills in the business to make pretty good money, or start my own business. But that's not really what I want to do. Not right now, anyway. And I have no friends here. Just my dad and cousins and younger brother. (And the place he lives is 20-25 minutes by car to town. It's very isolated, but a beautiful place to call home.)

My mother and I are estranged, and she hasn't really been in the picture for half of my life. When she left us, he made a lot of sacrifices to take care of us as a single father. His whole life is focused around me and my brother. And he sees me as ungrateful for all he's done for me. He always tells us that the farm is ours when he is gone, and he's saved all of it for us, his children. But it feels like the price of his gift of raising me is living up to his expectations and the life as he's planned out for me.

I told him about the job, and he got really quiet and acted like I'd broken his heart and betrayed him. He knew that I was looking to move there, but I think he didn't expect it to happen. I am going against everything he raised me to be, and he believes I don't care about family like he does.

He also isn't ok with me moving to the city my boyfriend is living in, and staying with him. Our relationship is pretty serious, but we aren't engaged or anything. I think this is the right thing for my life, though, and I just wish he could be emotionally supportive. It's already a scary transition, having to make new friends and start over somewhere new. His negativity and complete disapproval of my choices makes it seem 10 times harder. I feel like I owe my dad so much for the good live he's given me, and I feel awful for hurting him.

**tl;dr** I am not living up to my dad's expectations of living on the family farm and working in his small town family business. I accepted a job offer in the city where my boyfriend is in grad school and he's very upset with me and I feel awful.
