AGENT SIMS: The, uh, Cynthia Branson estate was worth how much? Because her family...
JIM: What family? We never heard from them. I sold her house for them, made them money.
AGENT SIMS: Hmmm. Your income, Mr Court, hasn't changed substantially in seventeen years.
JIM: That's right.
AGENT SIMS: Why would you stay so long with an operation that is so clearly not a growth enterprise?
JIM: Taking care of people isn't a growth enterprise, Mr Sims. I hope you write that down in your report, I'd like your bosses to read it.
