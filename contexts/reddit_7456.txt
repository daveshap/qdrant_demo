Has anyone else been offered to start Grad School this summer online?
I recently got admitted to grad school at the New School in NYC and the school has been emailing students to let them them know that they can start their classes this summer online rather than waiting for fall semester to start. It sounds great, but at the same time I do want the full grad school experience. Also, due to the coronavirus, my job has made us work remotely since all our materials and information can be accessed online. I kinda donâ€™t want to be glued to my laptop for 8+ hours a day.
