How do you not get attached so quickly when dating?
Sometimes when I am starting to talk to someone and we click, I notice myself getting really excited and begin painting a future together. I think about dates, first kisses, what the sex will be like, meeting each other’s friends, etc. I just go down a rabbit hole of wander. This is always of course unbeknownst to the other party and I always keep my cool as much as I can around them but that doesn’t go to say that I don’t still have these thoughts or talk to my best friend about it.

9 times out of 10 things never pan out with the guy like I anticipated and I always get my hopes up. Even after going through this cycle many times, it seems to always happen, even knowing it very likely may happen again, and I still don’t know how to not get giddy when it seems like a guy is really into me and I start wondering if I finally found the one.

It’s just so disappointing and discouraging to feel so certain that it’s going to work out with someone only for it to go south.

To those of you who have experienced this, how do you prevent this from happening and keep your cool?
