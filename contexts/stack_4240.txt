Anatomically correct succubus part 2: the diet Instead of the whole egg laying parasitic vagina concept, which was the leading idea in the original question.Assuming the succubus is purely the whole woman like creature.Can she gain enough sustenance from sex?And how can that acquisition of sustenance  (sex) cause a man to incrementally go insane?Answers need to reconcile body mass with caloric intake based on plausible metabolic rates.To be clear, this is specifically looking at how this one particular aspect of the succubi could be explained, rather than allowing the whole egg laying concept and looking at the big picture.
