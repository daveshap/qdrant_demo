ALONZO: Th-they want t-twenty-f-five million dollars cash--or Chemco will be destroyed.
RICHTER: Twenty-five-million! And what will they do if the money isn't delivered?
ALONZO: Th-th-they'll kill one hostage every hour until it is--
RICHTER: Does that include Helen Filmore, United States congresswoman?
ALONZO: Y-yes--
RICHTER: Uh-oh! Do you know if the demands are being taken seriously at this point, or does Washington think these people are just a bunch of crazy fuckers playing games?
ALONZO: Well, I-I hope that--that--
RICHTER: Times up!
