Why can't I rebattle the trainers I could in Pok\u00e9mon Black and White? So, I'm training for the Elite Four in my Pok\u00e9mon Black game. Normally, you could rebattle the trainers at Big Stadium and Small Court, but at the time I am writing this post, there is a baseball game going on in Big Stadium, so I cannot go there to train. There is also the Rotation Battle House in Opelucid City. But, the problem is, whenever I go to the trainers in the two places I can, I'm unable to do so, despite having not rebattled the trainers once today. I tried soft-resetting for the Rotation Battle House, exiting and reentering Small Court, and I still cannot rebattle the trainers. By the way, I'm playing on DeSmuMe. What has happened and how can I fix the problem?Edit:Big Stadium just opened up again and I rebattled all of the trainers there. However, I still can't battle the others in Small Court or Opelucid City.Edit 2: It's a new day and the reverse is happening. I can battle trainers in Small Court now, but now I can't battle anyone in Big Stadium or Opelucid City.Edit 3:I've made it to Undella Town, now I can't complete the Riches Challenge. Is it a problem with the emulator or what?
