Tried to overdose when i was 19 after breaking up with girlfriend - now 55 and happily married with 2 kids - I'm so glad i didn't die.
I was certain and i mean 100% certain that i had no reason to live at the age of 19.  I had lost the love of my life and i knew that life would be pointless without her.

But i was wrong.  Ten years later i met the most wonderful woman and have had a great life the last 35 years.  I look back and i am so glad i didn't die, didn't miss the life i have had, didn't hurt my mother who would have been totally crushed if i had succeeded.

You don't know what the future holds.  Things can get better.
