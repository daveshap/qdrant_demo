Beginner Q: Residual Sum Squared (RSS) and R2 I'm new to the forum and posting my first of many questions. I'm working on a Linear Regression model and the $R^2$ is 0.89 which tells me my regression line is a good fit. When I calculated the residual sum squared, the number is around 4060, which is telling me the difference between the predicted and actual values are large. Do the values $R^2$ = 0.89 and RSS = 4060 contradict each other?
