VICTORIA: Who told them that?
PONSONBY: I have no idea.
VICTORIA: Why not?
PONSONBY: I -- forgive me, ma'am, I am no wiser than yourself.
VICTORIA: No-one should think themselves wiser than me! It is not for any of the Queen's subjects to presume to tell Her Majesty when and where She should come out of mourning. It is the Queen's sorrow that keeps her secluded! It is Her overwhelming amount of work and responsibility, work which She feels will soon wear her out entirely!
PONSONBY: Your Majesty --
VICTORIA: Is it not enough that She is uncheered and unguided that she should also have to suffer these malicious rumors?! I am not a fool. I know there are those in the establishment too afraid to attack me and so they attack my dearest friends. Sometimes -- I feel that Brown is all I have left of Albert. And now they attack Brown too.
