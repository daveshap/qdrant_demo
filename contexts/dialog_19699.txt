ANNA: They didn't let me. I am in disgrace. Last week at the performance of Carmen I played a sour note. The conductor got so excited he yelled, There's sabotage in the string section!""
NINOTCHKA: Too bad... you missed an inspiring day, Anna.
ANNA: I know... my heart is sad... but my feet are happy. When all the tanks and guns were roaring over the Red Square I sat here all by myself and played a Beethoven sonata. Not bad at all. Are you expecting someone?
NINOTCHKA: A few friends... just a little dinner party.
ANNA: What are you serving?
NINOTCHKA: An omelet.
ANNA: An omelet! Aren't you living a little above your ration?
NINOTCHKA: Well, I've saved up two eggs and each of my friends is bringing his own so we'll manage.
ANNA: It just goes to prove the theory of our State. If you stand alone it means a boiled egg but if you're true to the collective spirit and stick together you've got an omelet. That reminds me... have you heard the latest they're telling about the Kremlin?
ANNA: I'll tell you later. That Gurganov, you never know whether he's on his way to the washroom or the Secret Police.
NINOTCHKA: You should be more careful, Anna.
ANNA: And you too, Ninotchka.
NINOTCHKA: About what?
ANNA: Ever since you have been back from Paris...
NINOTCHKA: I haven't talked to anyone about Paris. I haven't said a word.
ANNA: That's just it. It makes people feel queer. I dont' want you to get in any trouble.
NINOTCHKA: I have nothing to hide.
ANNA: You should. I'll show you.
ANNA: When I passed through the laundry yard today I saw all the women huddled around this so I brought it up here. Things like this create a bad feeling. First they didn't know whose it was. Then they saw the Paris label and did it start a commotion! Some said it's what we all ought to wear and others said it's like hanging foreign ideas on our clothesline. It undermines our whole cause.
NINOTCHKA: I see.
ANNA: You know how it is today... all you have to do is wear a pair of silk stockings and they suspect you of counter-revolution.
NINOTCHKA: Thank you, Anna. I'll dry it up here when I wash it next. I should hate to see our country endangered by my underwear.
ANNA: Ninotchka, you know I am your friend, you can trust me.... Did you bring back anything else?
NINOTCHKA: No, I left everything in Paris. I just happened to be wearing this.
ANNA: Tell me... what else did you have?
NINOTCHKA: Well, a hat...
ANNA: What was it like?
NINOTCHKA: It was very silly.... I would be ashamed to wear it here.
ANNA: As beautiful as that? What else? Come, tell me.
NINOTCHKA: An evening gown.
ANNA: Evening gown?
NINOTCHKA: A dress you wear in the evening.
ANNA: What do you wear in the morning?
NINOTCHKA: When you get up you put on a negligee, and then you change to a morning frock.
ANNA: You mean to tell me you wear a different dress for different times of the day?
NINOTCHKA: Yes.
ANNA: Now, Ninotchka, you're exaggerating.
NINOTCHKA: No, my dear, it is true. That's how they live in the other world. Here we dress to have our bodies covered... to keep warm....
ANNA: And there?
NINOTCHKA: Well, sometimes they're not completely covered but... they don't freeze.
ANNA: They must have wonderful materials to make a thing like this so soft... something you don't even see.
NINOTCHKA: You feel it, though.
ANNA: Ninotchka, I wouldn't bring this up if we weren't such good friends.
NINOTCHKA: What is it, Anna?
ANNA: You know I told you that Pavlov and I are going to get married when he comes back from the maneuvers. Would it be asking too much...
NINOTCHKA: You want this?
ANNA: Just for the honeymoon.
NINOTCHKA: You can have it for good. It is my wedding present.
