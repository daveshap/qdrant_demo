ELLIE: Malcolm's okay for now. I gave him a shot of morphine.
HAMMOND: They'll all be fine. Who better to get the children through Jurassic Park than a dinosaur expert?
ELLIE: Carousel.
HAMMOND: A carousel - - and a seesaw. They all moved, motorized of course, but people would swear they could see the fleas. I see the fleas
HAMMOND: But with this place, I - - I wanted to give them something real, something that wasn't an illusion, something they could see and touch. An aim devoid of merit.
ELLIE: But you can't think through this one. You have to feel it.
HAMMOND: You're absolutely right. Yes, you're right. Hiring Nedry was a mistake, that's obvious. 	We're over- dependent on automation, I can see that now. But that's all correctable for the next time around.
ELLIE: John, John. John, you're still building onto that Flea Circus, that illusion. And now you're adding onto it by what you're doing here. That's the illusion.
HAMMOND: Once we have control again we - -
ELLIE: Control?! You never had control! I was overwhelmed by the power of this place. So I made a mistake too. I didn't have enough respect for that power, and it's out now. You're sitting here trying to pick up the pieces. John, there's nothing worth picking up. The only thing that matters now are the people we love. Alan, Lex, and Tim. And John, they're out there where people are dying - - people are dying, you know?
