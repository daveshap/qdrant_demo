BUDDY: Yeah, I think I'm bleeding.
CINDY: Come on. There's a first aid kit in the lab.
BUDDY: Cindy, I've been thinking about this whole friend thing. I never had a friend that cares for me the way you do... I mean, there's Ray, but he cares for me in a different way. You know, bringing me flowers. Running my bath water. And then there's nights I wake up screaming and I look over and Ray's in my bed. Holding me. And seeing that tonight might be our last night together, I was thinking...
CINDY: That we should take our friendship a little further?
BUDDY: Yes...
CINDY: Oh, Buddy, I was thinking the same thing. It might be our last night in this house. And I think we should take full advantage of it.
BUDDY: I was thinking the same thing.
CINDY: We should act out our inner most fantasies.
BUDDY: Great!!!
CINDY: Like, I've always wanted to walk on the moon.
BUDDY: Huh?
CINDY: What about you, Buddy?
BUDDY: Well, I was hoping to get my balls licked.
CINDY: He's here.
BUDDY: Shit!
