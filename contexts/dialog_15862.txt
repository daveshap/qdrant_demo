ELLE: Okay -- Ms. Windham, when you uh arrived back at the house? Was your father there?
CHUTNEY: Not that I saw. But like I said, I went straight upstairs to take a shower.
ELLE: And when you came downstairs, what happened?
CHUTNEY: I saw Brooke standing over his body, drenched in his blood.
ELLE: But Mrs. Windham didn't have a gun?
CHUTNEY: No, she'd stashed it by then.
