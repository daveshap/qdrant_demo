SNYDER: I'll tell ya what you did, smart boy. You tied into a loaded mark on 47th across from Maxies. You and Coleman played the switch for him and blew him off to a cab on 49th. If he hadn't been a numbers runner for Doyle Lonnegan, it woulda been perfect.
HOOKER: You're crazy. I'm not stupid enough to play for rackets money.
SNYDER: Not intentionally maybe, but that don't make no difference to Lonnegan. He'll swat you like any fly.
HOOKER: I'll square it with the fixer.
SNYDER: Nobody can buy you a prayer, if I put the finger on ya.
