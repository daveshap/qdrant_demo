I took a chance and reached out
I took one last chance to reach out to the guy I went on two amazing dates with. 

And I got my answer. Which was no reply.

I feel so much better now. I tried, I gave it a shot. The ball was in his court. 
I feel relieved knowing for sure now that he is no longer interested. I could have waited another week to hear from him, but that would have been a complete waste of time and energy.

I can move on now with no regrets!
