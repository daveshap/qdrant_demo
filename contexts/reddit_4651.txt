Anyone feeling like a vulnerable child?
I’m 28f and struggling with both depression and anxiety. I have a lot of problems, but  something especially bothers me these days. I feel like a little girl who needs to be taken care of. I am scared of the outside world. I am an adult, I thought I was a strong woman but the depression and anxiety made me feel like a vulnerable, needy little child. I wasn’t always like that. I graduated from university, have worked in an important institution for 3 years. Then I had to quit and my life changed completely. I got depressed and extremely anxious. Now I lost my set-esteem. I feel hopeless and weak. Does anyone feel like that because of depression?Does it get better? What should I do?
