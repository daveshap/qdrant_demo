LIPNIK: ...Where did we put him?
BARTON: I'm at the Earle.
LIPNIK: Never heard of it. Let's move him to the Grand, or the Wilshire, or hell, he can stay at my place.
BARTON: Thanks, but I wanted a place that was less...
LIPNIK: Less Hollywood? Sure, say it, it's not a dirty word. Sat whatever the hell you want. The writer is king here at Capitol Pictures. You don't believe me, take a look at your paycheck at the end of every week – that's what we think of the writer. ...so what kind of pictures does he like?
LOU: Mr. Fink hasn't given a preference, Mr. Lipnik.
LIPNIK: How's about it, Bart?
BARTON: To be honest, I don't go to the pictures much, Mr. Lipnik –
LIPNIK: That's okay, that's okay, that's okay – that's just fine. You probably just walked in here thinking that was going to be a handicap, thinking we wanted people who knew something about the medium, maybe even thinking there was all kind of technical mumbo- jumbo to learn. You were dead wrong. We're only interested in one thing: Can you tell a story, Bart? Can you make us laugh, can you make us cry, can you make us wanna break out in joyous song? Is that more than one thing? Okay. The point is, I run this dump and I don't know the technical mumbo-jumbo. Why do I run it? I've got horse-sense, goddamnit. Showmanship. And also, and I hope Lou told you this, I bigger and meaner than any other kike in this town. Did you tell him that, Lou? And I don't mean my dick's bigger than yours, it's not a sexual thing – although, you're the writer, you would know more about that. Coffee?
BARTON: ...Yes, thank you.
LIPNIK: Lou.
