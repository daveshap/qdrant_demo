DOROTHY: You took that money from Julia's hand.
MIMI: I didn't.
DOROTHY: Then what are you hiding?
MIMI: It's a piece of evidence that's worth a great deal more than that.
DOROTHY: You hand that over to the police.
MIMI: I'll do nothing of the sort.
DOROTHY: All right, then. I'll tell them.
MIMI: I don't think you will. It's your father's.
DOROTHY: I don't believe it! You're lying!
MIMI: There!
DOROTHY: Oh!
MIMI: Now do you believe me!
