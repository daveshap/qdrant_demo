How would a sailing ship travel on land? Or, more specifically : How, starting with a regular ~16th something-century sailing ship, could it be possible to modify it to go on both land and sea?<br>In a pre-industrial setting, no fuel, no steam.<br>Ideally, I'm looking for a solution that allows a seamless transition from water to land with little to no need to stop and change setup.<br>My first instinct was to simply add huge wheels under the hull and maybe steer it with a second helm, but I have a feeling it might not be so simple.  I'm not looking for a completely detailed scientific explanation, but for a mechanism that would be plausible enough without getting deeply into specifics.Edit : After reading some of the answers, I'd like to add a few questions on compromises :  Would going for detachable wheels result in a more realistic construct?If it were to use some kind of supernatural force, what should it impact to be most effective? The wind? The weight of the ship? The resistance of materials?
