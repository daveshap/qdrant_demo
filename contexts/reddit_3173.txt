33, getting trapped in food service/retail?
So I do have a degree, and several years ago I worked for a financial services firm. But they were lay offing people and I decided to do a coding boot camp, which lead to no job. Afterwards I worked in a restaurant for a few years.

It's been several years since then. I gave my resume to a recruiter and it sounds like I'm not getting call backs because there are too many resume gaps of "real" experience. I'm getting quite worried.

What's a way out of the situation? Unfortunately the trades are out of the question as I am poor with that type of work.

EDIT: I'm not interested in coding anymore. I'm interested in any type of work that pays above minimum wage.
