WADE: Jesus, Pop, how can you stand the cold, dressed like that? Where's Ma?
POP: Sleeping.
WADE: You remember Margie Fogg?
POP: From Wickham's. Been a while. Like some coffee?
WADE: How you and Ma doing? Haven't seen you in town for a while.
POP: We're alright. Your Ma's sleeping. You want me to get her?
WADE: Yeah.
