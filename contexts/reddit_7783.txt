Buying a tablet for note taking and reading academic material
I find non-productive reading papers in my laptop, also i like being better organized by having my notes stored in  one place and not in a lot of paper which after will be waste. I am between ipad 7 10.2 and samsung tab s6 lite which in my country are in the same price but of course with the pencil sold separately for Ipad the cost will be higher. I would like to add that i would like to possibly use it as a secondary screen when i work on things on my laptop for better multitasking experience. Which of the 2 would you recommend?
