Wave function of a system of two identical fermions In N. Zettili's 'Quantum Mechanics Concepts and Applications' [chapter 8, solved problem 8.3], we have to find wave function and ground state energy of a system having two identical fermions and in the solution it is mentioned that the wave function of the system must be anti-symmetric.But if we have a system of two identical fermions(say electrons), the net spin of the system is then either 1 or 0, hence integral. So the wave function must be symmetric!Is this right or am I missing something because it is repeatedly written in Zettili in subsequent problems as well?
