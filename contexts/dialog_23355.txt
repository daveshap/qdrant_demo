ELLEN: Hello. Can I help you?
LINDNER: Does this dog here belong to you?
ELLEN: No, I've never seen him before.
LINDNER: You know, I saw him sitting outside your gate... Oh, I'm sorry, I'm forgetting my manners again! I haven't even introduced myself yet. Hi, my name's Lindner. Karl Lindner.
ELLEN: Ellen Straub.
LINDNER: It's a pleasure. You're from the city, right?
ELLEN: Do I look like it that much?
LINDNER: Village gossip. You're a real attraction here.
