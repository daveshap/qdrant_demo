Need outside opinion
One of my close friends had an incident recently. They were at their boyfriend's house and things were turning intimate. He asked her if she was ready/wanted to have sex with him. She told him that she wasn't ready and wanted to wait. She got a call and came off the phone crying. After he saw her like that, he starts making more moves and pushing it further and having sex with her. She called me crying about it, and how she didn't want to do it. What do you guys think
