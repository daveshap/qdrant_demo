Making a good impression as a new hire in the time of Covid-19?
I start a new job on Friday.  The last time I was a new-hire anywhere was 2012.

I have anxiety so I like to go into situations with a battle plan.  At the risk of sounding like Patrick Bateman, my battle plan for coming into a new job previously included:  


* Smiling easily and often
* Firm handshakes when first meeting people, with eye contact
* Asking coworkers/managers out to lunch to get to know them better/try to gain trust faster

All of these are impossible right now aside from eye contact, as I don't want to be touching new people, smiles will be covered by my mask, and I can't take people to lunch as restaurants are closed for dine in & employees are encouraged to eat alone when in the building, so as not to spread the virus (masks are off while eating).

Maybe I'm overthinking things, but I'm worried about coming off as cold or standoffish when I go in to meet my new manager on Friday.  This particular job is a field position that has very little face-to-face interaction after training, so I'm worried a poor first impression will be the only thing she remembers about me for years to come.  How the heck do I stand out when they won't even be able to see my face??
