Is there something wrong with me?
Ive recently been off of school for 1 week and ive found that i crave human interaction, but i end up doing nothing for the whole time as my friends arnt down to ever do anything (theyre not avoiding me, we are like the internet nerds kind of people ) and i say to people what did u do during the week off and their answer is similar to mine, but i feel as if i should do something with friends every single day, not only that but i also want to do things every single day. Am I too hungry for Human/friend interaction or am i fine and shouldnt really be doing anything during this time but relaxing. I know it also doesnt help that its winter and i live in an area with little to do but i can see this happening during the summer aswell.

Any advice or opinion at all would be greatly appeciated
Thank you ‚ù§
