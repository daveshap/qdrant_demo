Not rehired as a teacher- what else can I do?
Crossposting for more help.

 Throwaway so it cannot be linked with my other account.

I am a chemistry and physics teacher, and I was not rehired for next year. I do not want to be a teacher any longer. I am wondering what else I can possibly do? I have taught for 10 years, have a BS in biology and a MT in education. I am lost, I was just told like five minutes ago via video conference and... Help?
