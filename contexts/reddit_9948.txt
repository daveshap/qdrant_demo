Any college students with disabilities on here? I'm a SAHE student who needs your help...
Hello r/StudentAffairs! 

Thanks for clicking on my post. I attend Colorado State University as a graduate student in Student Affairs in Higher Education. As a student with a disability myself, I was actively involved in my undergrad institution with disability student activism, co-creating a club and a student office. I plan to graduate from CSU and work in disability services to help support student leadership. 

I am conducting research on college students with disabilities who have been or are currently involved in campus programs and activities. If you are a CURRENT college student (undergraduate or graduate) and you HAVE a disability, please take the following survey.

Thanks for your help! Also, pass it along to your friends who are students and have disabilities. The more the merrier!
