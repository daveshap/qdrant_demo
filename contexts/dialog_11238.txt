HELEN RAINES: The photo album. I get nostalgic around this time of year ...
MEMPHIS: What time of year?
HELEN RAINES: Tuesdays ...
MEMPHIS: You ever wonder what things'd be like if he hadn't died?
HELEN RAINES: Every day. I wonder about that every day...
MEMPHIS: Kip and I'd probably be working at the dealership... Imagine us selling cars?
HELEN RAINES: And just in case you lose your keys, good sir, I can toss in a complimentary slim-jim, free of charge ...
MEMPHIS: Mother -- !
HELEN RAINES: I remember. Supper getting cold, cos you two are out there heads under hoods ...
MEMPHIS: You remember that, Kip?
