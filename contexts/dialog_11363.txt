WILL: So why do you think I should work for the National Security Agency?
DYTRESS: Well, you'd be working on the cutting edge. You'd be exposed to the kind of technology you couldn't see anywhere else because we've classified it. Super string theory, Chaos Math, Advanced algorithms--
WILL: Codebreaking.
DYTRESS: That's one aspect of what we do.
WILL: Come on, that's what you do. You handle more than eighty percent of the intelligence workload. You're seven times the size of the C.I.A.
DYTRESS: That's exactly right, Will. So the question as I see it isn't why should you work for N.S.A." it's "why shouldn't you?""
WILL: Why shouldn't I work for the National Security Agency? That's a tough one.
