What are the best jobs for people who can't focus?
I started a new job and am struggling to pay attention in anything. I am very concerned about my career. I have doctors appointments scheduled to help diagnose a highly potential learning disability. I am having issues with food sensitivities that no doctor has been able to figure out the cause of. I feel like I wont be able to remain employed bc I am practically brain dead if I accidentally eat anything that causes any food intolerance symptoms. Idk what to do, my parents have not been supportive and I don't see how any of this gives me a bright future. How can I learn and grow in my career and life without the ability to function mentally?
