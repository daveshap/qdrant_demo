NAPOLEON: I didn't mean the things that I said... I was angry and I said more than I meant to.
JOSEPHINE: Oh, my darling. I'm sorry, too. I won't do that again -- whatever you do. I won't cause you any more embarrassment, I promise.
JOSEPHINE: Oh -- I didn't tell you... I've seen Dr. Corvisart, and he was very reassuring and encouraging. He has had excellent results with the waters of Plombiers, and he thinks it would be a good idea for me to spend a few weeks there. Apparently, he sent Madame Le Floch there last year, and she gave birth to twins.
NAPOLEON: Indeed -- well, you may tell Dr. Corvisart, I should be entirely satisfied with half her success.
