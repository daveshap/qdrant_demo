COOPER: What is it, Gordon?
COLE: COOP, AGENT CHET DESMOND HAS DISAPPEARED. GONE LIKE THE WIND IN DEER MEADOW.
STANLEY: Agent Chet said he wanted to check the trailer court one more time. He had me drive the van with the body back here. Which we did. It was 105 miles.
COOPER: Anything else?
STANLEY: Did Gordon show you a woman named Lil?
COOPER: I'm up to speed, Stanley.
STANLEY: Agent Chet wouldn't tell me what the Blue Rose meant.
COOPER: And neither will I.
STANLEY: Oh, alright. You know, I liked Agent Desmond. He had his own M.O.
STANLEY: I cracked the Whiteman case with this.
COOPER: Stanley, I heard all about it.
STANLEY: No one could've found those splinters without a machine like this and no one has a machine like this.
COOPER: Tell me about the letter.
STANLEY: Take a look at this. Chet and I found it under Teresa Banks' ring fingernail.
COOPER: And no one found the ring?
STANLEY: No, sir, we did not.
