MARTY: You come up here often?
CLARA: I was up here twice before. Once with a friend of mine and once I came up alone. The last time... do you see that girl in the gray dress sitting over there?
MARTY: Yeah.
CLARA: Well, the last time I was up here, that's where I sat. I sat there for an hour and a half, without moving a muscle. Now and then, some fellow would sort of walk up to me and then change his mind. I'll never forget just sitting there for an hour and a half with my hands in my lap. Then I began to cry, and I had to get up and go home.
MARTY: I cry a lot too. I'm a big cryer.
CLARA: This is something recent with me, this bursting into tears at the least thing.
MARTY: Oh, I cry all the time, any little thing. My brothers, my brother-in- laws, they're always telling me what a goodhearted guy I am. Well, you don't get goodhearted by accident. You get kicked around long enough, you get to be a real professor of pain. I know exactly how you feel. And I also want you to know I'm having a very good time with you now and really enjoying myself. So you see, you're not such a dog as you think you are.
CLARA: I'm having a very good time, too.
MARTY: So there you are. So I guess I'm not such a dog as I think I am.
CLARA: You're a very nice guy, and I don't know why some girl hasn't grabbed you off long ago.
MARTY: I don't know either. I think I'm a very nice guy. I also think I'm a pretty smart guy in my own way.
