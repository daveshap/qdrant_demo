MARION: I don't like it.
JACK: Why not?
MARION: I don't like it at all. You had a wonderful character before, the Gambler. He was so romantic.
JACK: He was a loser. This guy's a croupier. He can't lose. People have shat on him all his life. Now he's in control. He's a winner.
MARION: Is that your idea of a winner? He doesn't give a shit about anyone. He uses people and --
JACK: -- It's because of the sex, isn't it? You don't like the sex in it.
MARION: I don't give a fuck about the sex. Most men'll fuck a lamppost. He's just a miserable zombie. Is that the way you feel now? Is that what's happened to you?
JACK: Marion. It's a book.
MARION: Oh really. Then why is he called Jake. Why don't you come clean and call him Jack. There's no hope in it.
JACK: It's the truth.
MARION: Without hope there's no point to anything.
JACK: Now wait a minute. What's so hopeful about your job? Spending the day catching poor people stealing. You said yourself the organised gangs get away with it. At least in the casino everybody gets caught. Rich or poor, the odds are the same. It's all relative.
MARION: Crap. It's not relative. It's unfair. Like your casino. It's designed unfair. And your croupier's a little shit because he goes along with it.
