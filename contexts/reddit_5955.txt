Why isn’t there a circlejerk sub for the r/jobs subreddit?
There seems to be four main themes of this subreddit;

1.) Self pitying posts
2.) people constantly victim blaming people and looking for loopholes to make bad situations look like the OP’s fault, “I could build an entire company website in 48 hours, it doesn’t matter if you were entry level, you should have realized that when accepting a job offer, it’s all your fault you were fired”
3.) Anti-college posts “don’t go to college, TRADE SCHOOL FTW”
4.) “Screw hiring managers Employers just want a unicorn who farts glitter and turns purple on command” posts

It just seems perfect for a cj subreddit. Do you guys notice the repetitiveness?
