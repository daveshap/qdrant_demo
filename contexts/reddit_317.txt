My 13 yr old brother stole money from my mom
So recently my mom withdrawed 200 dollars in cash and couldn't find it. Earlier today, we found the 200 in his drawer, and we have no idea what to do, he is troubled and keeps to himself but refuses to see a psychologist and all that... This is not the first time he stolen something... Help please :(
