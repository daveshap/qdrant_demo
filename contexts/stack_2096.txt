Is there any specific word for extra or unwanted word in a sentence? There are certain words, if absent in a given sentence does not make any difference. For an example,Either today is Monday or Tuesday. Can also be written as:Today is Monday or Tuesday. These two sentences are exactly same without any loss of meaning per se. The only word that came across in my mind is filler. But, I am not happy with this word. It does not encompass entire meaning to what I am looking for. If I want to say: \"Either is called ____ in above example. Its absence in the sentence will not make any difference in the meaning of the given sentence.\"
