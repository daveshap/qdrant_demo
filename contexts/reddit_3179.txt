Should I take a better paying job or be a ‚Äúteam player‚Äù?
Throwaway to keep this off my main.

I (26F) have been working full time for a non-profit for 1.5 years.  

A few details about this job:

-pay is about $1,500 less annually than a living wage for a single adult in my city.  I have to work another (better paying) job part time to make ends meet/have any quality of life.  HOWEVER, we are getting a pay increase

-this position has had an extreme amount of turnover in the past few years. It‚Äôs on a small team which was being hired from scratch when I got there, because the previous team all quit within a few months.  More have quit since then

-the managers who have overseen all this turnover have been the same. It‚Äôs a small department, but my team works closely with our manager and her boss.  

-These two supervisors have very different management styles.  My direct supervisor (let‚Äôs call her Kim) is extremely lax, and likes to leave policies in gray areas.  Overall, I like Kim as a person, but this has been frustrating to work under since Kim‚Äôs boss, we‚Äôll call her Kath, has extremely specific expectations of her staff.  Kath also really likes to stick to chain of command, thereby relying entirely on Kim to communicate Kath‚Äôs expectations to my team (which Kim doesn‚Äôt really like to do).

Anyway, this environment has led to an extreme amount of stress in my life and I decided, after a few months of escalating nonsense, to look for other employment options.  This current position also requires me to do some intense physical work, and my health has been declining rapidly since I started working here.

I‚Äôm now pretty far along in the process of interviewing for a much higher paying position at the company I currently work for part time.  The only problem is, Kim just announced that she will be leaving her position, meaning I would leave my teammates (who I care about and don‚Äôt want to inconvenience) scrambling to cover for both me and Kim should I leave. 

I‚Äôm also planning on moving away from this city, and both of these jobs, in the next year. 

So, should I take this new, better job for a few months, or stick it out at this miserable one so as not to hurt my team?


Edit:  thanks everybody for the validation. I knew I should leave, but needed help seeing past my catholic guilt lol. Just finished another interview for the new job, fingers crossed!ü§û
