MOLA RAM: You were caught trying to steal the Sankara Stones.
INDIANA: Nobody's perfect. The way I heard it, you stole one of them from a small village.
MOLA RAM: There were five stones in the beginning. Over the centuries they were dispersed by wars, sold off by thieves like you...
INDIANA: Two are still missing.
MOLA RAM: No. They are here -- somewhere. A century ago when the British raided this temple and butchered my people, a loyal priest hid the last two stones down here in the catacombs.
INDIANA: That's what you've got these children -- these slaves digging for?
MOLA RAM: They dig for the gems to support our cause. They also search for the last two stones. Soon we will have all five Sankara Stones and the Thuggees will be all powerful!
INDIANA: Nobody can say you don't have a vivid imagination.
MOLA RAM: You do not believe me? You will, Dr. Jones. You will become a true believer.
