PEARL: Aren't you going to join us?
CINNABAR: I have to finish this for class.
PEARL: You got a vision, girl. Just like I got. Just like my momma had. And the good Lord didn't give you that vision just for painting pretty pictures. That's just wasted time.
CINNABAR: You mean as opposed to your life?
CINNABAR: I'm sorry, Momma. Maybe next time.
PEARL: I don't want you meeting around that house. You stay away from those kids. And away from that dog.
CINNABAR: They seemed alright. Bring a little life to that old building.
PEARL: Nothing but a wide world o' pain locked in there.
CINNABAR: Have you ever been inside?
PEARL: Maybe once upon a time. But that was long ago. Back before... before it became what it is.
CINNABAR: And what's that?
PEARL: Just a bad place. And the doorway to worse.
