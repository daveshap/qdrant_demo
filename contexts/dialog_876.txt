JETSON: Newcomers working near methane gasses at oil refineries must paint it on their boots to protect against sparks.
SYKES: How the hell do you know that?
JETSON: A large number of my people were hired by refineries because the methane fumes are not harmful to us. My spouse's brother is one.
SYKES: So the Slag they're cutting into upstairs worked at a refinery just like Hubley worked at a refinery. I'd say that possible" connection between the two cases just got a hell of a lot more possible. Okay
JETSON: I believe I should interview the widow alone.
SYKES: Why the hell--?! Great, fine. You talk to the wife.
O'NEAL: Mr. Hubley was an all right guy -- and a damn good manager. The men liked him. I'm really gonna have to scramble to fill his shoes.
SYKES: Well, one of the men didn't like him so much...
O'NEAL: You think this is the guy who did it?
SYKES: We think he could'a been involved, yeah. You know him?
O'NEAL: To be honest, it's hard to say. I hate to admit it but -- they all still kinda look alike to me.
SYKES: Who else can I ask around here?
O'NEAL: Wait. You know who it looks like? Yeah. Anderson. Uh... James Anderson. He isn't in today. He took the afternoon off.
SYKES: I think you're gonna find he's taken the rest of his life off.
SYKES: That where Anderson worked?
O'NEAL: Yes it is. Thirty-five percent pure Methane gas in there. I don't know how these fellas do it.
