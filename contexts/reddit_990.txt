Does anyone else feel like they're constantly doing something wrong but nobody's telling them what it is?
That's the best way I can put it. When people are nice to me I convince myself it's forced, someone has asked them to do it/they are obligated to do it, and that I'm constantly making mistakes but people aren't telling me to spare my feelings. 

It borders on paranoia and is very overwhelming, I just constantly fear having made some sort of mistake/making someone mad and that nobody is telling me about it. It's a daily occurrence for me to have this thought process.

Is that weird? Am I alone in this?
