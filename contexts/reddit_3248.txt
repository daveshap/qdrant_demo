Do people really enjoy working? I can't decide if I should switch career completly to try to find something I might enjoy doing OR just accept that working sucks and try to find a cushy job that makes it tolerable ?!
Do people really enjoy working?  I can't decide if I should switch career completly to try to find something I might enjoy doing OR just accept that working sucks and try to find a cushy job that makes it tolerable ?!

Background:

I graduated in accounting 3 years ago, been in  5 position during those 3 years.  Only one of them had work that was tolerable and VERY good condition (friday afternoon off, no stress, not too much workload, 4 weeks vacation, cool colleague, etc.)  basically I am wondering if its normal to NOT like working at all? or its just that I am in the wrong field ?! 

Anyone here is excited when waking up and rly wants to go to work?  (for me i just want to run home after work, and do things I enjoy, like reading, playing videogames, talking to girlfriend, taking a walk, relaxing, etc.)  

So bascially should I try to find interesting work that I love and build my life around it OR should I find a tolerable job with good conditions and lots of free time to enjoy my life outside of work ?!
