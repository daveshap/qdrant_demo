Just called the suicide hotline
... and was asked to please 'watch my language.'

The actual fuck.

Yea, I have a mouth on me. Yea, I have an attitude problem. But how the FUCK you going to work at a suicide hotline, even the fucking graveyard shift (heh -- suicide hotline; graveyard shift -- heh), and tell callers their language BOTHERS you? How you gonna LET that language bother you? It's WORDS, you fucking TWAT-NOZZLE. It's a HURTING HUMAN expressing herself.

Jesus fuck.
