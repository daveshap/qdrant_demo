GENERAL TAYLOR: We have high confidence in the expanded air strike option. The problem, Mr. President, is that it's a short-term solution. Khruschev can send more missiles next month. The Chiefs and I believe we should follow up the air strikes with the full version of OPLAN 316.
THE PRESIDENT: An invasion...
GENERAL TAYLOR: Yes, sir. We can be sure we get all the missiles, and we remove Castro so this can never happen again.
THE PRESIDENT: Is this the Chiefs' recommendation?
GENERAL TAYLOR: Yes, sir. Our best option is to commence the strikes before the missiles are operational. The invasion happens eight days later.
