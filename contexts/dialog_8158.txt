EXLEY: No... Where'd the tip come from?
DUDLEY: Anonymous. Probably nothing.
DUDLEY: You're perplexing to me these days, Wendell. You're not your old, cruel self anymore. I need proof that the extracurricular work I had planned for you remains within your grasp.
BUD: What work?
DUDLEY: I've long been involved in containing hard crime in such a way that myself and a few colleagues might someday enjoy a profit dispensation. That day will soon be here and you'll share handsomely. Grand means will be in our hands, Wendell.
DUDLEY: Imagine crime limited to the criminal element who perpetrate it. Imagine the means to keep the nigger filth sedated. But don't stop there. Extrapolate. Imagine the police in control. It's big, lad.
BUD: You lost me, Dudley. I don't know what you're talking about.
DUDLEY: You have your extracurricular secrets, I have mine. We'll hold a clarification session soon. For now, I need your fearsome old habits at the Victory Motel. We're going to brace a man who may know who killed Jack Vincennes. Can I count on you?
BUD: Sure, boss. Sure you can.
