ZORG: How's that? Can you hear me better now?
SECRETARY: Yes, Mr. Zorg, I hear you perfectly! So, how was the concert?
ZORG: Who gives a shit! I didn't come here to listen to music! Listen up instead of running off at the mouth! The batteries on my phone are almost gone.
SECRETARY: Yes, Sir!
ZORG: Dispatch me another ZFX200 immediately. Someone stole mine.
SECRETARY: Right away, Sir. I'll send you a new one to the hotel.
ZORG: I'm not at the hotel!
