CHEF: It's really too much -- I mean I've collected every picture of her since she was Miss December.
CLEAN: Yeah -- you can really get hung up on them like the cat in the Delta.
CHIEF: What cat ?
CLEAN: One that went up for murder -- he was an Army Sergeant.
CHIEF: I never heard about that.
CLEAN: Yeah -- he really dug his Playboy mag, man -- I mean like he was there when it arrived -- He just knew.
CHEF: So what happened ?
CLEAN: He was working A.R.V.N. patrols and had one a them little cocky gook asshole Lieutenants -- anyhow, the Lieutenant took his new Playboy one day, sat on the end of the dock, and wouldn't give it back.
CHEF: Yeah -- typical A.R.V.N.
CLEAN: Then went too far -- he sat there and starts mutilating the centerfold. Poking pins in her an' all that. Sergeant says, don't do her like that. You leave your shitty little hands off that girl. Gook Lieutenant says Fuck you in Vietnamese -- Sergeant says, don't do that again. You'll wish you hadn't. Then he stood up, flicked his iron to rock and roll and gave the little zero a long burst through the Playboy mag. Man, it blew him clean off the dock -- Hell, just the magazine was floatin' there all full of holes.
CHIEF: They nail him for it bad ?
CLEAN: He's in the L.B.J. -- didn't give him no medals or nothing --
