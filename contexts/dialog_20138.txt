BIG NURSE: Mister McMurphy, patients are not permitted to run around in towels.
MCMURPHY: I wanna report a robbery!
BIG NURSE: On this ward?
MCMURPHY: Yeah, some creep stole my cigarettes!
BIG NURSE: Oh, I had them removed.
MCMURPHY: What for?
BIG NURSE: Patients are rationed to one pack of cigarettes a day.
