I AM REALLY CLOSE TO JUST GIVING UP
everything around me just seems pointless to me. I am currently in the midst of an exam period and have done around 3 hours of study total for 5 exams. I have no motivation and just sit in silence just fuckin sad. I am not apart of a friend group and just have friends who each have their own friend group and always see photos of them out with their groups without me while I just sit at home. Specifically, there was a time where my mate who I routinely gamed with was going out every Friday and Saturday night thus taking away the limited time both of us were free to play games in. This meant I would get on by myself and just not enjoy it. 

I am just sick of not being included and "loved" in a way by my friends and peers and this shit is making me feel so alone and to make things worse I am 16M and still haven't had my first hook up (which may not sound like a big deal for my age) but always hearing about the new girl or guy one of your friends is with just adds to the loneliness. 

Also, the girl who is literally one of my closest mates is PERFECT in my eyes and I have been repeatedly sent to the friend zone and have to live with the "pain" knowing how bad I want to be with her and just care for her but she doesn't feel the same :/

Even better is when I only get to see my father twice a year for a total of around two weeks as he lives abroad married to another woman after my mum found him cheating with my now step mum. I won't get to see him until at least 2021 and just am overall struggling.

Sorry for the long paragraph but I am struggling with a lot of things and seriously contemplating ending it all just could never imagine the pain my single mother would feel. That is the only factor keeping me from ENDING IT ALL AHHHHHHHHHHHHH.
