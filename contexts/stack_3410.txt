Older Iron Man where he is remote controlling an Iron Man suit and it shoots up from the basement through a chute I think I remember an image of Iron Man/Tony Stark remote controlling an Iron Man suit from a basement. He's sitting in a spherical control chair, and I think that the Iron Man shoots up from a basement through a chute.I just re-watched all the MCU since 2008, I think it's from earlier than that.
