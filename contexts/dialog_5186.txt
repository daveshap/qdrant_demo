LASZLO: This time they really mean to stop me.
ILSA: Victor, I'm afraid for you.
LASZLO: We have been in difficult places before, haven't we?
LASZLO: I must find out what Berger knows.
ILSA: Be careful.
LASZLO: I will, don't worry.
LASZLO: Mr. Berger, the ring, could I see it again?
BERGER: Yes, Monsieur.
LASZLO: A champagne cocktail, please.
BERGER: I recognize you from the news photographs, Monsieur Laszlo.
LASZLO: In a concentration camp, one is apt to lose a little weight.
BERGER: We read five times that you were killed in five different places.
LASZLO: As you see, it was true every single time. Thank heaven I found you, Berger. I am looking for a man by the name of Ugarte. He is supposed to help me.
