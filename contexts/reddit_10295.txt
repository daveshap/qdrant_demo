Should i commit suicide?
Im a 13yo Male. My dad pressures me to get staight A’s and if i don’t he threatens me to beat the crap out of me. Because of the pandemic my dad stays home all day and constantly watch me doing homework and hit me and yell at me. I would usually avoid him at school, now that my safe haven is closed i can’t handle this anymore im considering ending it. Also please leave tips for painless ways of suicide. 

Sorry if my grammar is bad ,english is my second language.
