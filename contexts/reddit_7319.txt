How to negotiate: looking for book recommendation
I'm looking for book recommendations on the topic of learning how to negotiate successfully. 

While negotiating salaries for women might be interesting for a side project, I'm mainly looking at how to negotiate with contractors to get the best deal available while not alienating them. My biggest issue seems to be to be either a) too modest woman or b) too aggressive in negotiating, going for an all or nothing approach. I think I need to learn to to get more professional.

Thanks a lot for your recommendations.
