We euthanize pets when we think they have no more quality of life left and it’s deemed the “responsible” thing to do. But when a human knows their life and that they have no hope left, suddenly everyone becomes the expert on “suicide is selfish and there’s a chance things will get better”
I don’t want to live out the next 50-60 years of my natural lifespan in pain waiting for the day to come so I just want to take matters into my own hands now and save myself the suffering. I don’t need judged and told to hold on because things “might” improve. My life has had 17 years in it. Plenty of time to live it and know it’s never going to get any better. If things were ever going to get better and my life was going to improve then it would’ve happened by now
