MCCLEOD: The prize? So much blood so that in the end the one that remains will be mortal again. So much pain so that the winner can grow old and have children. The prize hardly seems worth the cost of it.
CAVANAUGH: There will be more to the prize than that. Power will come with it -- and it must be used for good.
MCCLEOD: The days of magic are ending. The world is changing.
CAVANAUGH: Aye -- yet one such as I who has wandered this world for nearly nine centuries can remember back to other days of change. Days of Robin of the Hood and Arthur Pendragon. They were real enough once, but they drifted into men's dreams and became legend - - as we shall do one day.
