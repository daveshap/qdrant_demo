how to present results for two group success rate with confidence interval I have two groups A and B, and for each data point I have two possible outcomes, success and failures. For each group, I have calculated the success rate, and the confidence interval for a binomial proportion. For example:A: success rate is 27% (interval +- 5)B: success rate is 42% (interval +- 4)I have also used the Fisher exact t-test to calculate the p-value and make sure the results are significant.My question is the following, how do I present these results? Can I say that there is a 15% improvement in success rate? with what confidence interval? what is the p-value? what else can I tell about my experiment? Thank you.
