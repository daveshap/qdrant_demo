DMITRI: People say Anastasia was the only member of the Royal Family to escape alive. That makes her an orphan too
DMITRI: What happened to your parents?
ANYA: I don't know - I don't remember anything that happened before the revolution. . .
DMITRI: You know, it's strange - Anastasia's grandmother, the Dowager Empress Tatiana has been looking for Anastasia since the revolution. Why do you think she wouldn't go to her own grandmother?
ANYA: I don't know. I don't see what this has to do with me.
DMITRI: Perhaps it's because she has amnesia too - can't remember. . .
