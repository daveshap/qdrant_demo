DANNY: Closure? How do you find closure when her killers are still running around out there?
NANCY: I found forgiveness in my heart for the people who killed my daughter. I gave my grief to Jesus Christ.
DANNY: Is that what you want me to do? Put it all on Jesus? Let him sort it out in the afterlife?
NANCY: You've got to deal with this sooner or later, Tom. You can't keep hiding.
DANNY: Maybe I am dealing with it.
NANCY: I know it's not my place to pass judgement on you but ...
DANNY: Then why don't I see any pictures Of me up there?
VERNE: That was my idea.
DANNY: You never did like me much, did you Verne? And you can't stand it that I walked out of there alive and Liz didn't. You think I'm a coward, don't you?
