No communication after setting date?
I’m super new to the dating scene after about 15 years so sorry if I sound like such a newbie. 

I’ve been doing a few apps and have been talking to some great guys so far. One particularly nice one has set up a date with me for this Sunday over a week ago. Since setting up the date though he hasn’t messaged at all. Is this common? I’ll still be going to the date but I felt like I’ve lost a little interest in him since we haven’t talked and now other guys seem more interesting.
