What are some jobs where slowness is a virtue?
I’m slow. Not stupid, I’ve been tested, I don’t have any cognitive impairment or learning disability they know how to test, I am simply not fast.

In every job and school I’ve been in, that’s the only complaint I’ve ever gotten but which I always, always get: I am not fast enough, I don’t do quickly enough, I am not time-efficient enough.

And now, instead of just listing a number of corporations, occupations and government branches that you think are inefficient because you are the most original comedian in the world, can anyone here suggest careers, occupations or vocations where being slow isn’t a hindrance?
