MACE: What the fuck are you doing?
LENNY: Coming with you.
MACE: You will not live to see the morning.
STRICKLAND: Nero.
LENNY: Strickland.
STRICKLAND: Commissioner Strickland.
LENNY: Sure. Whatever. See, since you shitcanned my career, I don't even have to call you sir. One of life's small pleasures.
STRICKLAND: Aren't you peddling your wares a little far from your usual gutter?
LENNY: I was invited here by a close friend, Mr. Fumitsu, see he's right over there.
STRICKLAND: I don't like disappointments, Nero. And do you know what disappoints me very much?
LENNY: Your sex life?
STRICKLAND: Your existence.
