BALA: He's...he's dead. You don't have to look for him anymore. He was eaten by a praying mantis.
FORMICA: It's a shame he died prematurely...I was hoping to kill him myself.
BALA: Well you'll never be able to hurt him where he is now. I miss him already.
FORMICA: You miss him? <u>Why</u>?
BALA: Because...because he's <u>twice</u> the ant that you are. I could <u>never</u> go through with marrying you. I'm -- I'm an <u>individual</u>, and when I get married, it'll be to someone <u>I</u> choose.
