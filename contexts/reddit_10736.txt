im killing myself on my 17th birthday
i dont care how my family will feel anymore. i dont care how sad my boyfriend will get. i will never be happy and ive come to terms with that. ive been suicidal since i was a kid for some unknown reason. i wanted to walk into traffic, ive been self harming since i was 6 or 7 without really knowing it. im angry at everyone all the time and cant talk to someone without being belittled or causing anxiety. ive gone through therapy and tried pills. ive been hospitalized and nothing works. ive planned it and im in the process of writing my note to my boyfriend. i hate myself and everyone in my life. i hate myself so much. i really cant do it anymore. dont try to convince me otherwise it will not work.
