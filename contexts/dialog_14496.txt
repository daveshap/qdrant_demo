HOOPER: I didn't say this wasn't the shark, I just said I wasn't sure this was the one...
BRODY: What d'ya mean?
HOOPER: There are hundreds of different kinds of sharks; makos, blues, hammerheads, white-tips... any one of them could've attacked. Look -- shark digestion is slow. We could open this one up, and find whatever he's been eating is still inside.
VAUGHN: That's disgusting! This is the largest, meanest, most vicious shark ever landed off Amity Island, and a known maneater!
HOOPER: Let's just cut him open and see what's inside...
BRODY: Why not, Larry? We could get a positive confirmation that way.
VAUGHN: Be reasonable, boys -- this isn't the time or the place to do some kind of half-assed autopsy on a fish. Ben... do you have all the pictures you need?
