ELLEN: Why do you polish that thing all the time?
MAURICE: You're talking to me?
ELLEN: Why do you polish it?
MAURICE: A Book Society Award is a very prestigious thing.
ELLEN: Why are you polishing it -- in bed -- in your pajamas -- at 11:15 at night? Are you going to show it to someone?
MAURICE: No.
ELLEN: Then why?
MAURICE: There's no reason.
ELLEN: Exactly. No reason. No occasion. It just makes you feel good to do something for it, to express your pride and affection for it some how... How come you'd do that for a piece of metal and not for me?
