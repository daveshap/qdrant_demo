CROW HORSE: Big sonuvabuck. Based on the depth of that print, pressure releases... I'd say he goes two-ten, two-fifteen --
RAY: Bullshit.
CROW HORSE: -- Well, maybe two-seventeen.
RAY: You're trying to tell me you can read all that from a track?
CROW HORSE: No. Not just a track. You gotta listen to the trees, man. To the leaves. To this sand, you FBI's kicked all up. You gotta listen to the earth.
RAY: Is that right? Well, listen to this: drag your ass. This is a restricted area.
CROW HORSE: No, this is the home of the Oglala Sioux and I want the dog-fucker who killed Leo. Whether you get him or I get him, I just want him. Shit's been goin' on too long.
RAY: You've got no jurisdiction.
CROW HORSE: You got no know-how. About Indian Way. Or about Jack Shit for that matter.
RAY: Maybe you're not aware of this, Crow Horse, but I just flew in from a place called the Twentieth Century where we have such things as electrostatic tracking methods, psycholingusitics, DNA fingerprinting; I don't have to crawl around with the scorpions and talk to the fucking trees to get answers. Leo was killed right here.
CROW HORSE: Go back to the M.E., take a look inside Leo's exit wounds and tell me how chicken feed got in there. Trust me, there ain't chickens in the Badlands. His mother's place is --
RAY: -- his mother never lived here. She was from up in North Dakota.
CROW HORSE: I'm talkin' his spiritual mother. Maisy Blue Legs.
RAY: His spiritual mother...
CROW HORSE: To us Indians, our spiritual relatives are as close as family. I've got seven mothers on this reservation. Sisters. Brothers. You ain't one of them.
RAY: Thank God. Now listen to me, asshole. I'm giving you a break. But if my partner finds out you're here, you're gonna be reading rat tracks in Sioux Falls Maximum Security.
CROW HORSE: Easy. Easy... I'm goin'.
