What reasons support and oppose the motion that a right to privacy should be added to the Constitution?
The People's Republic of China [employ extensive surveillance](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/08/business/china-surveillance-technology.html) mechanisms to suppress dissent and socially engineer Chinese citizens populating mainland China. The Communist Party is currently implementing a social credit system that's designed to function as a financial credit score and as a citizen's [social score](https://www.wired.com/story/age-of-social-credit/) based on his or her political views, the goods and services they purchase and their association with others.  The Public Security Bureau (their national police force) wants an ["omnipresent, completely connected, always on and fully controllable"](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/02/china-surveillance/552203/) surveillance system implemented throughout the nation.  [China's surveillance state](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/07/china-surveillance-state-artificial-intelligence) represent the fruit of private enterprise and ingenuity, and the [anti-democratic motivations of a repressive regime](https://thediplomat.com/2018/07/china-and-the-lessons-of-modern-surveillance-technology/). 

In the United States, the situation isn't the same, but privacy advocates still have cause to worry.  According to the Supreme Court, the [third party doctrine](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/12/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-third-party-doctrine/282721/) dictates that if an individual willfully releases private information to a third party, the government doesn't require a warrant to access said information because their is no expectation of privacy on the individual's part. Nonetheless, ten states have privacy rights outlined in their constitutions, as shown [here](http://www.ncsl.org/research/telecommunications-and-information-technology/privacy-protections-in-state-constitutions.aspx) by the national conference of state legislatures.  The right to privacy, as [currently outlined in the common law](https://www.livescience.com/37398-right-to-privacy.html), also influences abortion policy.

What does a fundamental right to privacy entail? Is it public, private, or does sit somewhere in between?  If it is codified in the Constitution, should Congress, the States or both be granted enforcement power?  Why should, or shouldn't, we include a right to privacy in the U.S Constitution?
