How to avoid telling people I went to rehab
(Not for drugs, im 15f and I have a condition that made it hard to walk and that's a different story)
 
So I'm going into 10th grade and I missed sectionals for band camp (2 days a week to start practicing for football games)  because I was in rehab idk what to tell people where I've been because I don't want to be an 'attention whore'. :( 
I'm doing a lot better now and it's something that you wouldn't know most days if you just looked at me. I don't want to be dishonest either but I don't know what else to do.
