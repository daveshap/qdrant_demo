MIKE: Sandy? Could I talk to you a minute?
SANDY: Sure, just a sec. Excuse me.
MIKE: Come on out a minute, okay?
SANDY: Okay.
MRS. WILLIAMS: Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes.
JEFFREY: Sure thing, please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
MRS. WILLIAMS: Nice of you to offer, Jeffrey, but certainly not. Just relax and enjoy your coffee. I'm sure Sandy will be back soon.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS: Jeffrey?
JEFFREY: Yes?
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS: If you want to come up a minute, I'll show you some pictures.
