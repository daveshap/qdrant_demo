MARION: I don't want a criminal for a boyfriend.
JACK: There was a message, wasn't there?
MARION: It's probably easier for you to eat the rice.
JACK: Marion! What did you tell the police?
MARION: Nothing about you.
JACK: Then what?
MARION: Give up being a croupier, Jack. Or I'll shop you. All you have to do is keep your word. It's that simple.
MARION: Here...use a spoon.
JACK: Leave me alone, Marion.
MARION: You're already alone.
