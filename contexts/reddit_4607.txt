I just can’t anymore.
My best friend got married yesterday, but didn’t even bother to tell me that he was getting married.  I only found out after other people I know started posting photos from the wedding.  I don’t know what I did to deserve this.

He was my last friend, but not really I guess.

I am transgender and since coming out all of my friends have abandoned me, one-by-one until he was all that was left.  I get it though, truly, who wants to be friends with someone like me?  Hell, even after well over a year of hormones, makeup practice, and other efforts I could never hope to pass as a woman.  It’s probably just too embarrassing to be seen with me; even the trans subreddits barely register my selfie attempts.  The only people who ever say anything positive about me are people I pay.

I have been trying to stay positive, but this is bullshit.  I just want something to go right for me; just for once.    I go out of my way to help people all the time, listen to their problems, and just generally try to be positive.  It makes me sad and angry that I don’t have anyone who would be like that for me.

Halp.
