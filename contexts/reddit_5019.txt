Resubmitting resume after denial to show perseverance
I see a lot of LinkedIn influencers going viral with posts like “we hired this person for their perseverance” or “if I gave you a million dollars, could you find the team leads email? The hiring managers?” Etc. 

Has anybody actually successfully pulled something like that off? Like, LinkedIn stalking their profile and sending a personal email? 

I’m thinking about resubmitting my resume to this job and this time reaching out to the hiring manager. Think I can pull it off as some display of “perseverance” with the right approach?
