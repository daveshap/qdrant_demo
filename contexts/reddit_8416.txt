Why is every US State government modeled after the Federal government?
Almost all states use the ["presidential" system of governance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_U.S._state_governments), with a bicameral legislature, legislators are elected using single member districts, and a separate executive branch exists for the office of the governor. While minor variations in procedure exist within each state's constitution, the overall electoral process and structure of their government remains almost identical. [Reynolds vs Sims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reynolds_v._Sims) case broadly outlined that states had to adopt some form of representation that is equal for all citizens in their legislature if they use districts.

Could states experimented with a parliamentary system of government or attempted any other form of electoral selection like proportional representation or sortition? Are there legal barriers preventing this, or is it mostly cultural/systemic?
