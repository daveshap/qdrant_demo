What, if anything, could legally be done to curtail 'Fake News' in the United States?
[Wikipedia defines Fake News as 'a type of yellow journalism or propaganda that consists of deliberate misinformation or hoaxes spread via traditional print and broadcast news media or online social media.'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fake_news)

What could be done about 'Fake News' constitutionally? [The freedom of speech and freedom of the press are granted in the first amendment](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment), but [the FTC can and does place restrictions on truth in advertising](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/media-resources/truth-advertising). Could similar restrictions be legally placed (even if to a lesser extent) on news organizations? If so, what are the pros and cons to such restrictions? If not, why not? Are there other alternatives that could achieve similar goals, and if so what are they?
