Equivalence principle, is gravity a fictitious force that we feel everyday? I am currently self studying general relativity. I have a question regarding the equivalence principle. If an observer is in the elevator in deep space (or Minkowski space) where there is no gravitational force, and the elevator is accelerating upward with an  a=g (9.8 m/s^2), he/she can't tell the difference of being in an elevator resting on the surface, so it is impossible to distinguish such systems.  (we are not considering tidal forces).How can this be possible. I mean, if I am in a spaceship that is accelerating for ever with a = 9.8 m/s^2 I will always feel the \"fictitious\" force  pulling me back, just like we feel them in non inertial frames. When I am in the elevator at rest, I don't feel any fictitious force pulling me back. Or do I?
