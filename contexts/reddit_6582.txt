How to leave a union?
I'm a public employee, and I am currently in the IBEW union, paying dues of $100 every month. I learned that employees are still covered by the union even if I don't pay these dues. I originally joined the union to get their health plan, but I am looking to switch it. I also need to save as much money as possible right now.


I called to try to stop paying dues, but they gave me a hard time about it - prodding me about why I want to stop and what the union has to offer. I could hear her fumbling her words because she could not think of anything besides some luncheon and being able to vote for union stuff.


I'm not even a big fan of unions. I feel like they encourage laziness. But even for the positives it brings, like safety measures and stuff, a lot of these do not apply to me. The union is for electrical and construction workers, while I'm a programmer who just sits at his desk all day.


The lady then said they only accept this on ONE day of the year, and I have to send in a hand-written letter of resignation for this. Is this bullshit or a common practice? Anyone have luck in opting out of union fees?

**EDIT** Or on the flip side, can anyone convince me to continue paying my dues? $1200 a year is a lot of money. I guess they do negotiate a high salary for all of us, but I got a really uncomfortable, brain-washing and threatening vibe from them on the phone.
