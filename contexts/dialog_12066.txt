STARLING: <u>Who</u> are these guys...?
BARNEY: Rich, comic book freaks.
STARLING: And why is it a vacant exercise?
BARNEY: Because we both know who's buying the Lechteriana.
STARLING: Who would that be.

STARLING: No, you're wrong about Verger.
BARNEY: Oh, yes. He's found Peace.
STARLING: Well, if he hasn't, I'm vastly mistaken.
BARNEY: And have <u>you</u> found Peace..?
