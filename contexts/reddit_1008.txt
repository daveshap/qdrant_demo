I got on stage in front of 600 people to deliver a speech for a public speaking competition... And I won!!!
## Some Context
I was diagnosed with ADHD in March, that same day I decided to conquer my fear and spoke on stage for the first time in a public speaking competition against 9 other people. I ended up winning! 

A few nights ago, I competed in the Finals for title of *Inspirational Speaker of the Year* and many other amazing prizes... 

And I won!
