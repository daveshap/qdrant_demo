A rant and question. Finishing a master's on time before PhD during this pandemic?
Posting here because I am a current graduate student worried about progressing on time.

I am in a two-year MSc program in biology, having started in Sept. 2019. I want to apply for admission to PhD programs for Sept 2021, but given the COVID-19 pandemic, I am starting to worry that I won't be able to finish on time. My university suspended all lab access in March. 

I went straight from high school, to BSc to MSc without taking a gap year and finishing everything on time. I feel worried that this is the first time that I won't finish on time, and I am wondering if I should even apply to PhD programs, given this uncertainty. Unlike those who are coming from their BSc, whether I graduate depends on finishing experiments and my thesis, not on coursework.

I guess my questions are:

* Is anyone else worried about finishing on time, either for further studies or for a job?
* How to address the very real possibility that if I do get accepted to a PhD program, and I need an extra semester to wrap up my experiments and thesis, how to bring this up to the graduate school/PhD supervisor. I feel like it would look a bit bad on my part. I understand that some schools might not even allow a deferral of admission to another semester.
