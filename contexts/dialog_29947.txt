JOHN: You sure seen a lot for a blind man.
BLIND MAN: Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
JOHN: That a fact?
BLIND MAN: I can see just fine. For example: You're a young man who thinks he's got someplace to be.
JOHN: Maybe I do.
BLIND MAN: Or maybe you just think you do. You can run just as far as you can, but wherever you go, there you are.
JOHN: I think I've heard that before.
BLIND MAN: What do you want for free?
JOHN: You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.
BLIND MAN: That's 'cause I've done a lot of living.
JOHN: Maybe one day I'll get to sit on a corner and spout wise.
BLIND MAN: Think you'll live that long?
BLIND MAN: Ain't you got a little something for the infirm?
JOHN: I'm a little short. I'll catch you next time.
BLIND MAN: I won't hold my breath.
