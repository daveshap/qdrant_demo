I will not kill myself before I haven't tried everything
I have made this decisions when I thought about suicide a lot last winter. I was ashamed of myself because I think that I gave up way to early. I am fighting against mental and physical health problems and I will not give up until I tried everything to improve my situation.
I hope you guys do this to it's really good to look at things that way.
Edit: Thanks for the silver u/DrHitshot I hope you are doing well!
