I don't like college.
I hate the culture. I don't drink, I'm not comfortable smoking here, and I don't like partying. My US school is a party school masquerading as a 'public Ivy'. I'm bored and it isn't challenging me the way everyone told me it would.

I miss my boyfriend. We're young and no one thinks we'll stay together except for us and a few close friends. I barely care what they think. I'm ready to settle in with him and live my life how I want to, finally, after years of living with the nagging voice of my parents in the back of my mind.

I want to go to the community college near my hometown, get an associate's, then transfer to the local public university. The price would be reasonable, rather than requiring $8000 of debt each year. The price of this semester alone e makes me nauseous when I think of it. I have better shit to do than throw money into a school I'm barely happy at. I want my life to be under my control but I'm still fucking scared of doing it.
