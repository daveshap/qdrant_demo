Worst date I’ve been on lol
Met this girl I remember from high school on tinder we agreed on a date, long story short we agree to go to a gig together seeing as she’s training to be an event manager. On the day I get there she introduces me to the band and half the people at the gig seems friendly and everyone welcomes me.  We get to the dance floor the musics kicking and I’m feeling like this could be a great night, I’m dancing beside her smiling laughing at her jokes then she introduces me to her boyfriend. I put on a fake smile and shake this dudes hand. He puts his arm round her and she gives me the f*ck me eyes. I do the math in my head and realise the situation and I remind myself that I am not that type of guy and covertly commit an Irish goodbye to this gig ( an Irish goodbye is leaving without saying anything) and bomb it the f*ck out of the bar. Lesson of the story always ask if the girl your talking to is single just for safety.
