ASHLEY: Gabriel! You said talk to him. That's all you ever said...
GABRIEL: We're talking, aren't we?
GABRIEL: How much money's in that casino? Day-to-day.
RUDY: I don't know.
GABRIEL: The hell you don't.
RUDY: Five million?
GABRIEL: You wrote Ash that letter, you told her that story 'bout working Christmas Eve, bout how they'd send half the security guys home, nobody comin, in that night. And the rest of you got shit-faced drinking hot buttered rum. That a true story now?
RUDY: Christmas... Eve...
GABRIEL: You know where the guards are. You know how to get in and out. You know where the money is. We're taking down that casino, convict. You're the guy gonna tell us how.
RUDY: Hey, it's... been two years --
GABRIEL: We got faith in you, Nick Mason. You're our inside man.
