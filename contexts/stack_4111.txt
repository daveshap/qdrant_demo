Ukrainian passport renewal I am looking for information on the renewal of an Ukrainian passport in Ukraine itself. Any information on the process, time taken, cost and especially the documents needed would be very helpful.I tried looking for a website that contained all this information, but all I could find was the application for a new passport and nothing on renewals.  Also, I'm keen to know if a renewal of the international passport can only be done if the \"internal\" passport (the compulsory ID Ukrainian citizens all hold) is still active and not expired. If it needs to be active, it would be great to know how this passport can also be renewed, cost, time etc.
