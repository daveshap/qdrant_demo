ANNIE'S VOICE-OVER: That was fun. I don't think California is bad at all. It's a drag coming home.
ALVY'S VOICE-OVER: Lotta beautiful women. It was fun to flirt.
ANNIE'S VOICE-OVER: I have to face facts. I-I adore Alvy, but our relationship doesn't seem to work anymore.
ALVY'S VOICE-OVER: I'll have the usual trouble with Annie in bed tonight. Whatta I need this?
ANNIE'S VOICE-OVER: If only I had the nerve to break up, but it would really hurt him.
ALVY'S VOICE-OVER: If only I didn't feel guilty asking Annie to move out. It'd probably wreck her. But I should be honest.
ANNIE: Alvy, uh, let's face it. You know something, don't think our relationship is working.
ALVY: Tsch, I know. A relationship, I think, is-is like a shark, you know? It has to constantly move forward or it dies. And I think what we got on our hands is a dead shark.
ALVY: Whose Catcher in the Rye" is this?"
ANNIE: Well, let's see now... If it has my name on it, then I guess it's mine.
ALVY: Oh, it sure has... You know, you wrote your name in all my books, 'cause you knew this day was gonna come.
ANNIE: Well, uh, Alvy, you wanted to break up just as much as I do.
ALVY: There's no-no question in my mind. I think we're doing the mature thing, without any doubt.
ANNIE: Now, look, all the books on death and dying are yours and all the poetry books are mine.
ALVY: This Denial of Death". You remember this?"
ANNIE: Oh-
ALVY: This is the first book that I got you.
ANNIE: God.
ALVY: Remember that day?
ANNIE: Right. Geez, I feel like there's a great weight off my back. M'mmm.
ALVY: Thanks, honey.
ANNIE: Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I mean, you know, no, no, no, I mean, I think it's really important for us to explore new relationships and stuff like that.
