Need Advice about Love.
 

So, in the winter of 2018 a girl (well call her G) moved to my city and we had a few classes together and since she was different from al the other (mostly Basic) girls i've started liking her. We've started to hang out and i've developed feelings for her, which i've confessed to her this summer but she rejected me. We've agreed to just stay friends, which i've thought we are to this day. Later this year she invited me to have dancing lessons with her and I agreed. But as its usual where I life i've had a Different dancing Partner. On this Saturday we had a Dance ball. My Mom (who is a Psychological Therapist) observed me and had an deep talk with me about love and stuff. Her words were that almost everyone can see, that i am in love with G. I’ve said that were just friends to which she replied, that i've buried and bottled my emotions for her to which i’ve started crying bc it's true and i did everything with her thinking were just friends pushing away feelings and subconsciously still loving her. 

She rejected me once saying that she doesn't want a Bf at the time and now im too afraid to ask her about it (and don't even know how to subtly ask if she has feelings for me). She thinks (afaik) that i'm decent looking and that we fit together perfectly. Heck even if we dance together it looks like we’ve never did something else (which is an big sign in my opinion). My problem is, that my feelings are still buried and I really don't know what to do or how to sort or unbury my feelings. I would say I love G and I can tell that she has a lot of fun with me if we spend time together.I know, that she has a really low self esteem and Likes to play with other’s feelings. 

I'm floating in a big void of questions, so if anyone has tips or advice please share it.

Thanks for reading
