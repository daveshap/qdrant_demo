How do I check the status of my drivers and install them if needed? I'm trying to learn how to use Ubuntu, but I must say I didn't have half as many issues with 16 as I have had with 18.04I'm using a laptop and I'm at a beginner-level. (But I'm willing to learn)And basically I'm having a lot of lag, and perhaps I don't have the correct drivers. I'd need an easy command to pull up my system info, and then run a check on my drivers and download what's needed.Proc: AMD e1-1200 APU with Radeon HD graphics x2,Mem: 3.5m total, 1.7g used, 651m free,Swap: 3.6g total, 29m used, 3.6g freeCPU MHz:             778.147,CPU max MHz:         1400.0000,CPU min MHz:         777.0000
