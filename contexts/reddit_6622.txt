Do companies/recruiters ever get back to you for another position?
I'm currently looking for my first job after college and so far, I've received a lot of rejections to my applications. However, in some e-mails recruiters say that they will keep my data for the next year in case they have a suitable position for me. What do recruiters do when the company looks for someone? First scan all the 'old' candidates any maybe contacting them and only after that post a job ad online?

I also had two rounds of interview with a company and they said they think I'm a good match but due to Corona, they decided not to hire someone at the moment (no one fresh from college at least). They said they want to get back in touch in the future but I'm worried that by then they have already forgotten.
