NAISH: You sure this guy's supposed to ride with us? Seems kind of weird.
WYDELL: Chief said pick him up and take him with us on our house to house. Guy's an ex-cop, thinks he can help.
NAISH: Sounds like a bad idea to me, probally just get in the way.
WYDELL: Yeah, well I guess it's tough to sit on the sidelines and wait when your own kid's missing... besides, ain't no such thing as an ex-cop.
NAISH: I guess not.
WYDELL: That must be him.
WYDELL: Mr. Willis?
MR. WILLIS: Yes, sir.
WYDELL: I'm Wydell... this is Naish.
NAISH: Hey.
MR. WILLIS: George Willis... ...any leads?
WYDELL: Well, we were on our way out to run a check on a couple farmhouses out on the edge of town... closest thing we got to a lead at this point.
MR. WILLIS: That's it?
WYDELL: Well, all we know is the kids were headed out to a spot the locals call Deadwood to play Nancy Drew with some local legend about this character everybody calls Dr. Satan.
MR. WILLIS: Dr. Satan?
NAISH: Yeah it's horseshit, just some boogieman crap that the kids like to scare each other with.
WYDELL: Anyway, there's not much else out that way... so, I figure maybe there's a chance the kids broke down and found their way over to one of the farms.
MR. WILLIS: What about the body you found?
WYDELL: Oh, yeah, you know about that? Hmmm, that's a strange one.
NAISH: Local girl, Karen Murphy, been missing for a couple months, figured for a runaway.
MR. WILLIS: Fit the profile?
NAISH: No, not really. Good kid, never been in any trouble.
WYDELL: Her part in this I can't figure... but I will.
MR. WILLIS: Christ, you know it's crazy... I lived through so many other people's nightmares, you know. Always cool and calm, but... but I never thought I'd be the one needing help, ya know?
NAISH: Don't worry, we'll find her.
WYDELL: Let's hit the road, sooner we get a move on sooner we'll find her.
