19. Lost and confused. Want to do some type of trade. Where to begin? Any help is appreciated
So I’m 19 and college just wasn’t for me. 


I’m eager to start a career and get out of my parents house. I’m willing to do whatever it takes to do so. I just want to start something that has a livable wage ($19+ an hour)


I’ve been looking into joining an apprenticeship program through a union, but there’s a bit of an “old boys club” mentality, meaning that you kind of have to know someone to make it in a trade. I don’t know anyone.


So any tips? What should I do? I’m in Illinois if that helps.
