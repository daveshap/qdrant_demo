MUMFORD: You're doing great.
SOFIE: I don't know if I'm going to make it the whole way.
MUMFORD: It doesn't matter. Go on.
SOFIE: Oh... this makes me sound irrational, which is probably right, but there was something about him saying this -- it was maybe the millionth time he'd told me about some preference of his. Well, I was so... tired of it. Seems like my whole life someone's been telling me... I'm just not getting it right. Can we rest for a second?
SOFIE: You're purposely making me talk while we do this... ...because you think this is good for me... ...and you're a sadistic bastard...
MUMFORD: Yes.
SOFIE: ...who thinks there's nothing really wrong with me.
MUMFORD: Oh, there's something wrong with you, all right. Especially after hearing that dream of yours, about the Roto-Rooter.
SOFIE: That was really bad, wasn't it?
MUMFORD: Disgusting.
SOFIE: And I'll bet you can interpret the whole thing
MUMFORD: It's pretty obvious to a trained professional.
