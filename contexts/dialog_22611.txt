LEE: I need your help, Master. I'm seeking a man who used to train with you. He's become a killer - the worst kind of animal.

MASTER FU: He was the best I ever trained, you know.
LEE: Ricky Tan?
MASTER FU: No. Your father. Your father and Ricky Tan were my favorite students... and for such awful things to happen as they did --
