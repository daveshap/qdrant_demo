Is it worth leaving my perfect (but stagnant) internship turned job to further strengthen my graduate school app w/ additional work experience at a different, more competitive firm?
Or should I just stay where I am at until graduation and grad school application time?

What looks better?

A) 2.5 years at firm X with increased responsibilities, tasks, duties, etc. also within the same industry as intended masters, but very different sectors. 

B) 1.5 years at the previously mentioned firm X, but then taking 1.0 years spent with firm(s) X and/or Y to perform tasks very close to what masters will be. (**Before Applying) 

(Sorry if this makes no sense)
