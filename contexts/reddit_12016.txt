I lost my dream job
Hey guys I got fired from my dream job yesterday. I was working in a music store fixing guitars and doing quality control, apparently I'm not experienced enough in fixing them that they feel comfortable to let me do it and they feel that taking the time to teach me as I go would take too much time for them. I don't know I was hoping I could get some advice, maybe you guys can help me feel better.
