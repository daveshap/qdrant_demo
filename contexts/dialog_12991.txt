PAUL: Get out of this room and get back to work.
GREGOIRE: I don't have to listen to you anymore.
PAUL: I am in charge now. Get back to work or I'll fire you.
GREGOIRE: Let me ask you Mr. Manager, do you notice a smell of cockroaches? If I were to leave this room, I'm sure I could find this smell. I know people who could cleanse it. But maybe it doesn't bother you? Why is that? Are used to this smell? Not me, I need a clean room to escape it.
COLONEL OLIVER: Paul, you know who this is?
PAUL: Yes, Colonel Monsieur Xavier, the Minister of Finance.
COLONEL OLIVER: Get him a room, but tell no one he is here. Paul will look after you.
XAVIER: I will need a suite.
PAUL: Of course.
