CLEAR: What are you doing? You're going to kill us!
KIMBERLY: No. If anyone dies from a crash now, it'll be me. But I can't die if Eugene and Isabella are still alive. I'm last on Death's list.
CLEAR: Are you crazy? What makes you think you'd survive?
KIMBERLY: What happened when Eugene tried to kill himself out of turn?
CLEAR: Six duds in a row.
KIMBERLY: And when it was Rory's turn to die, and Thomas was in the way?
