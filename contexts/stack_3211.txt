How much of The Language of Thorns is canon? The Language of Thorns is a book of short stories or fairy tales by Leigh Bardugo. While some of them seem that they might be freestanding, others clearly have elements from the  Grishaverse (that is, the Shadow and Bone trilogy and so forth). For example, the narration mentions locations such as Ketterdam, and nationalities or ethnicities such as Suli.However, some elements of the stories seem to be very different from the sorts of magic seen in the Grishaverse (for example, the candy-magic, or the beast\u2019s power), while others seem as if they might (in-universe) have been inspired by the actions of the Grisha (such as the story of \u201cLittle Knife\u201d). In particular, the first story, \u201cAyama and the Thorn Wood,\u201d seems to have no connection with the Grishaverse at all. On the other hand, the back jacket also confidently declares the book to be part of the Grishaverse. What elements of this book are part of the Grishaverse?
