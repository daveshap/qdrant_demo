BUD: Did you get anything on the cameras. Video or anything?
LINDSEY: No. Look, forget it. I don't want to talk about it.
BUD: Fine. Be that way.
LINDSEY: I don't know what I saw. Okay? Coffey wants to call it a Russian submersible, fine. It's a Russian submersible. No problem.
BUD: But you think it's something else. What? One of ours?
LINDSEY: No.
BUD: Whose then? Lindsey? Talk to me...
LINDSEY: Jammer saw something in there, something that scared the hell out him--
BUD: His mixture got screwed up. He panicked and pranged his regulator.
LINDSEY: But what did he see that made him panic?
BUD: What do you think he saw?
LINDSEY: I don't know. I DON'T KNOW!
