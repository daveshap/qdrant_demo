What careers offer a decent salary with little to no stress?
Recent marketing grad here working in finance relates sales. Ever since I started full time at my current job I haven’t really felt like myself. I hate the pressure put on me to perform and I feel that it’s slowly killing me. I’ve noticed that I’m a lot more anxious and I have started relying on alcohol more often. I’d like a position with safety where I can just come in, do my job, and leave without all of the meeting quotas bs and constantly putting on fake smiles. What are my options?
