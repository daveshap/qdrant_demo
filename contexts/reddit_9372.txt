Just found out that EBT/Medicaid recipients are eligible to get a discount on Amazon Prime membership
You can get it for 6 dollars instead of the normal 13. I didn't know this was a thing until this morning so I figured I would share for anyone who was unaware like I was. I could have been saving 6 bucks a month this whole time!

Edit:  [Here is the page to sign up](https://amazon.com/qualify) for those interested. Looks like you just need to upload a pic of your EBT card as proof. 
  
Mods, I hope this isn't against the rules, please let me know if so and I will gladly take it down.
