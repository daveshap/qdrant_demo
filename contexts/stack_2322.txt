How to set maximum allowed ping in matchmaking? Another Valve game Counter-Strike: Global Offensive allows setting the highest allowed ping for connected servers in options, but I haven't found a corresponding option in the Team Fortress 2 settings or a console command for the game.I often queue for one map only and am frequently placed to an overseas server with close to 150 ping.
