Sum-of-products, simplication can you help to simply the following boolean expression?F = /ABC + /AB/C + ABC + AB/C + /A/BC + /A/B/CUsing an online I found out the solution which should be = B + /ABut I am not sure of the last step = /AB(C + /C) + AB(C + /C)  +  /A/B( C + /C ) simplify using rule 6= /AB + AB + /A/B    (OR Distributive Law)= B(/A + A) + /A/B  simplify using rule 6= B + /A/B      expand using Distributive law until here (B + /A/B) I think I am correct From here below I am not sure I took the right way = (B + /B)(B +/A)     AND Distributive law A + (B.C) = (A + B).(A + C)   = (B + /B)(B +/A) simplify using rule 6= B + /A
