Where do you find cool PowerPoint templates?
I'm giving a talk at a really large conference in a few weeks and I want to have a cool PowerPoint template that isn't one of the pre-loaded themes on PowerPoint. One of my presentation pet peeves is a boring template so I'd love to hear your resources for cool talk templates. Cheers!
