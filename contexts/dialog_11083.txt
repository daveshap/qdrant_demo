HAGEN: He says he doesn't know anything, and I believe him. Roth played this one beautifully.
MICHAEL: Alright. I'm going to go outside and talk to Fredo.
FREDO: I don't have a lot to say, Michael.
MICHAEL: We have time.
FREDO: I was kept pretty much in the dark. I didn't know all that much.
MICHAEL: What about now, is there anything you can help me out with?
FREDO: I know they get Pentangeli, that's all I know.
FREDO: I didn't know it was a hit. I swear to you I didn't know. Johnny Ola contacted me in Beverly Hills -- said he wanted to talk. He said you and Roth were in on some big deal, and there was a place for me in it if I could help them out. They said you were being tough on the negotiation, and if they had a little bit of help, they could close it fast and it would be good for you.
MICHAEL: And you believed that story.
FREDO: He said there was something good in it for me...me on my own.
MICHAEL: I've always taken care of you.
FREDO: Taken care of me. Mike, you're my kid brother, and you take care of my. Did you ever think of that. Ever once? Send Fredo off to do this, send Fredo to take care of that... take care of some little unimportant night club here, and there; pick somebody up at the airport. Mike, I'm your older brother; I was stepped over!
MICHAEL: It's the way Pop wanted it.
FREDO: It wasn't the way I wanted it! I can handle things. I'm not dumb Christ, not like everyone says. I'm smart; and I want respect.
MICHAEL: There's nothing more you can tell me about this investigation?
FREDO: The lawyer; Questadt, he belongs to Roth.
MICHAEL: You're nothing to me now, Fredo; not a brother, not a friend, I don't want to know you, or what happens to you. I don't want to see you at the hotels, or near my home. When you visit our Mother, I want to know a day in advance, so I won't be there. Do you understand?
