GUTTIEREZ: Hold it, hold it...
DE VRIES: What's wrong?
GUTTIEREZ: I'm picking up another signal.
DE VRIES: What? Where?
GUTTIEREZ: Just behind us, over to the right.
DE VRIES: Can't see a thing. Are you sure?
GUTTIEREZ: Yeah, I...
GUTTIEREZ: Wait. Lost it.
DE VRIES: How?
GUTTIEREZ: I dunno. Might be a glitch.
DE VRIES: Oh, man. That's no glitch!
GUTTIEREZ: It's alright, it's cool...
DE VRIES: Is it still moving?
GUTTIEREZ: No, he's stopped; he's totally still. Just take it nice and easy, babe. Nice and easy...
