A name for the appendage \"s\" in plurals, & the possessive, attributive, genitive, ownership It could be oversight, under-learning or such but on and off I remember that I never learned what to call the game-changer \"-s\" that comes in to distinguish plurals from singulars. \"Plural -s\" is all that I learned and use.  Of as much significance is the \"-s\" that the apostrophe brings with it in the forms of words variously described as possessive, attributive, genitive or ownership. I've been referring to it as the respective \"-s,\" i.e., \"possessive -s,\" etc. Would have saved a lot of breath if these two applications of the \"s\" had a name in grammar. Hopefully at least one of them does.
