the amount of people suffering here is insane
do you sometimes realize that the amount of people suffering from severe depression and on the brink of killing themselves on this subreddit and outside of this subreddit really speaks the painful truth about our socaity and our world in general? the world we live in ladies and gentlemen are crule uncaring and cold
in this socaity we view the mentaly ill as an outcast an alien a very disgusting and unacceptable creature....which we pretend to care about and try to "help" them
if you suffer from cancer or any other illness people can actually acknowledge your pain and know you are suffering
they know how hug your scars are
but with mental illness people sometimes understemate your suffering
people understemate how severe your depression actually is
people say go get therapy, take anti depressiants but its not a 100% cure it never cured everyone((i myself took pills but it never worked))
actually depression and other disorders
never had a magical cure like we have on flu...yet we dont take it seriously 
and the result? suicide

i really wish depression was like a flu it could get away with some medicine
but no ...its like a curse...once you get it
its gonna never stop hurting you
only if its not too late and only if you got some huge will to live you maybe can get through it ...maybe
its like a snake ...eats you from the inside out
first it eats your will to live and then it eats your ability to enjoy things 
and finally when it really completely took over your mind and body ...it will make you wish for death and later on plan it
this snake feeds on neglect truamatizing events
and deep scars left unhealed...and we can only destroy this cursed snake with care , love and good treatment
not risk truamatize suicidal people with more shit...i swear people could never understand us and only the ones who suffer like us can only understand what if really feels like to have this shitty disorder...
if only people could at least show a bit of understand and care
we would'nt ever get to this point
that idea really makes me hate humanity and myself even more...everything bad happens to us is what we deserve 
we all cold and greedy
we all just take take and take
we never give
we never gave to eachother nor to this poor plant
we all deserve to die 
no one is good
if there is good left in us its only minor
god if you even exist please end us already
please end me...i dont want to see myself living inside this hell forever
the hell is in me and in the world
i can never fix myself nor i can fix the fucked up world
the best i could do is just die

edit : one day and this many upvotes? well i gusse there are a lot of people who get me , wow im not completely misunderstood for being a sick fuck!
thanks for you all ....you all are my shining hope in this darkness ...im lost here and trying to find my way out of here...
well at least the moment i die i could still think back and see i was never alone in how i saw this world
