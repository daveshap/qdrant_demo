32M with 9 years of failed equity/startup exp - am I unemployable?
I have 6 years of work experience before graduating college, plus another 9 years of experience since. However, my post-college experience has all been in tech startups, whether as a Cofounder or early employee. Each startup was funded in Silicon Valley with varying degrees of success, but I've never made more than $48k/year in 'salary' from any of those companies preferring equity.

I've recently gotten married, putting a stop to my bootstrapping lifestyle in pursuit of something more comfortable for my wife. I'm from Silicon Valley and have friends here making $100k+ with 3-4 years of experience doing one thing well vs being a generalist like me.

Job titles and their descriptions confuse me - I relate most to project management, but don't think my experience is similar to ones in larger tech companies with 100m+ customers. I've collectively managed maybe 10m.

Am I screwed? Should I expect to take a pay cut/less senior position to prove my loyalty in the workforce? Many have told me I come across as an opportunist whom a larger employer won't want to invest in....
