JERRY: I know -- Teresa -—
KIKI: I hated you that day —- you and your flip talk -— with that little girl lying dead.
JERRY: I know. What do you think I felt when you said, don't be soft?""
KIKI: Jerry, I want you to be soft. You are soft -- inside -— where it matters. I wanted it that day too, but didn't dare tell you.
JERRY: We ought to dare to tell each other everything, Kiki -- you and I.
