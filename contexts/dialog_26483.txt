NUCLEAR MAN: Destroy Superman!
LEX: Wait! Not yet! Back!
SUPERMAN: Your time in prison has twisted you into a delusionary state, Luthor.
LEX: No, no, listen. I escaped with only one thing on my mind . . . the end of Superman.
SUPERMAN: I'm not going anywhere.
LEX: I'll ignore that . . . So, I created a monster who didn't work nearly as well as I might have liked -- you were clearly his better -- he needed more energy, more power.
SUPERMAN: Which explains why you sent his organic matter to the sun.
LEX: Precisely. And then it came to me. My greatest ever plan. I made a deal with some minor league Bad Boys. Arms Dealers, Renegades Generals, You know the type. With you gone, we'll make a fortune rearming the world.
SUPERMAN: You'd risk worldwide nuclear war for your own personal financial gains.
LEX: Nobody wants war. I'd just like to keep the threat alive.
SUPERMAN: A mind is a terrible thing to waste, Lex Luthor. And you've wasted yours on this foul monstrosity. I'm taking you in.
LEX: Nifty, huh? Goodnight Sweet Prince, parting is . . . inevitable Now, destroy Superman.
NUCLEAR MAN: First, I have fun.
