ROBERT ENGLUND: Heather? You doing okay?
HEATHER: Holding my own. You know that guy who was calling me all the time? He's started again. He's been putting stuff in my mail.
ROBERT ENGLUND: Must've read about the funeral. Sick mother. That's the last thing you need right now, I'm sure.
HEATHER: It's actually been giving me Freddy nightmares.
