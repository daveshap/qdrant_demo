Convince me not to quit my job without a plan
I am so incredibly unhappy with my job. I won't write a sob story. I hate it. Management is terrible. Customers suck. About 10 staff quit this month only. It is very understaffed very miserable, I hate it. I have been looking for 3 months now actively applying for jobs. Nothing. I went part time recently and got a huge pay cut because I just could not do it full time anymore. It was mentally exhausting and burning me out to depression. It is getting back there now even though I am only working 20 hours a week. Two more people quit today and its been a terrible day. I need to atleast have some income in and I can't risk it with only $1,600 in my savings and bills being $500 a month. Please help convince me not to walk out of this job today.
