Why am I so conflicted?
Um, I'm not very good at starting posts, so I'll just start talking about my problem.

So, I'm new to being a teen (turned 13 a while ago) but I can tell I already want to be different. So many of the people at my school are the same. You have the nice people, the 6th graders, the sporty ones, and the ones that don't really fit anywhere else, but, from the looks of things, I'm the only one who is excessively concerned about my future. For the past five years, I've been trying to get noticed, prepare for that big day when I finish the project, but I've gotten almost nowhere. I'm not even half done with it, and I want to do it, but I can't stop procrastinating! Heck, managing to revise what I had made me happier than I had been for the last three months.

Now, for the conflicts, I'll just list them out:

•I don't want to fall in love or anything, but I keep falling for fictional characters

•I constantly daydream and lie about working on things in my head, but I spend weeks (even months) perfecting every detail, even when I daydream about real-life situations

•I like working, but all I do is procrastinate

•I stay up all night so I can work, but I continue to procrastinate, because I don't remember my dreams anymore, and I find sleep pointless, but I like the sleeping experience

•As soon as I try working on one thing, I immediately begin to work on a new project

So, uh, I'm causing myself a lot of stress for almost no reason whatsoever, and I can't seem to stop.

Anybody have advice?
