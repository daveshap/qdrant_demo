CLAY: These are your paintings?
WHALE: What? Oh yes.
CLAY: Excuse me, but -- are you famous?
WHALE: You know what they say. If you have to ask --
CLAY: I'm just a hick who cuts lawns. But some of these look familiar.
WHALE: They were familiar when I painted them. That one's copied from a Dutch still life done almost three hundred years ago. And that's a Rembrandt.
CLAY: They're just copies then. Gotcha.
WHALE: But before I retired, you might say I had a brief time in the sun. Fame, as it were. Tell me, do you like motion pictures?
CLAY: Sure, everybody does. When I was a kid I'd go with my sister twice a week. Why? Were you an actor or something?
WHALE: In my youth, yes, but never in Hollywood. No, I was merely a director here.
CLAY: Yeah? What were some of your movies?
WHALE: This and that. The only ones you maybe have heard of are the Frankenstein" pictures."
CLAY: Really?
CLAY: Frankenstein" and "Bride of" and "Son of" and all the rest?"
WHALE: I made only the first two. The others were done by hacks.
CLAY: Still. You must be rich. Making a couple of famous movies like those.
WHALE: Merely comfortable. Here's Hanna with our refreshments. Can you get the door?
HANNA: How are you feeling, Mr. Jimmy? How is your mind today?
WHALE: My mind's lovely. And yours?
HANNA: You remember what the doctor tells us.
WHALE: Yes, yes, yes. I merely invited Mr. Boone in for a glass of tea. We'll have a brief chat and he'll finish the yard.
HANNA: I am not forgetting your last brief chat.
WHALE: Just go. We can manage without you.
HANNA: He looks plenty big. You won't need my help if anything goes flooey.
WHALE: Go.
WHALE: When they stay in your employ too long, servants begin to think they're married to you. Please, Mr. Boone. Help yourself.
CLAY: What did she mean by going flooey?
WHALE: I returned recently from a stay in hospital.
CLAY: What was wrong?
WHALE: Nothing serious. A touch of stroke.
WHALE: You must excuse me for staring, Mr. Boone. But you have a marvelous head.
CLAY: Huh?
WHALE: To an artistic eye, you understand. Have you ever modeled?
CLAY: You mean, like posed for pictures?
WHALE: Sat for an artist. Been sketched.
CLAY: What's to sketch?
WHALE: You have the most architectural skull. And your nose. Very expressive.
CLAY: Broke is more like it.
WHALE: But expressively broken. How did it happen?
CLAY: Football in college.
WHALE: You went to university?
CLAY: Just a year. I dropped out to join the Marines.
WHALE: Yes. You were a Marine.
WHALE: I apologize for going on like this. It's the Sunday painter in me. Of course I can understand your refusal. It's a great deal to ask of someone.
CLAY: You mean -- you really want to draw me?
WHALE: Indeed. I'd pay for the privilege of drawing your head.
CLAY: But why?
WHALE: Even an amateur artist needs a subject to inspire him.
CLAY: And it's just my head you want? Nothing else?
WHALE: What are you suggesting? You'll charge extra if I include a hand or a bit of shoulder.
CLAY: You don't want to draw pictures of me in my birthday suit, right?
WHALE: I have no interest in your body, Mr. Boone. I can assure you of that.
CLAY: All right then. Sure. I could use the extra dough.
WHALE: Excellent. We'll have a most interesting time.
