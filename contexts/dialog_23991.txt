VIKTOR: Hal, what are you doing?
HAL: Viktor, Clyde simply has to get close to Simone in this scene! He has to touch her. He has to!
VIKTOR: Absolutely not!
HAL: But she's right there! I must feel her!
VIKTOR: You can't.
HAL: Why not?
VIKTOR: There's... a wall between you --
HAL: -- an emotional wall, I know. That's why --
VIKTOR: -- No. No. A real wall. You ran right through it.
HAL: How did the wall get there?
VIKTOR: I can't explain it to you now -- you'll see when it's all put together. Anyway, we got it a couple of takes ago. Let's move on.
