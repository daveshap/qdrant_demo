GASTON: Attacks repulsed, as I was saying. This is only for this war, Captain. Viet Cong -- 54; North Vietnamese regular forces -- 15; South Vietnamese -- 28 -- regular forces and otherwise. Americain -- 6. Of course, they were, perhaps, mistakes, Captain.
WILLARD: Of course. I -- Once we make our repairs, we could send word, we could have you evacuated from here.
GASTON: Captain?
WILLARD: You'll get blown outta here some day.
GASTON: We will never 'evacuate', Captain -- this is our home. Indochina is ours; it has been so for a hundred and twenty-one years, there is something to say for that.
WILLARD: The Vietnamese think it's theirs -- I guess the Americans do, too.
GASTON: But we civilized it. A place belongs to those who bring light to it, don't you agree.
WILLARD: I always thought the French came here to get the rubber.
