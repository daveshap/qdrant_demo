How do I tell my friends and family that I am depressed?
I am 21 years old, I’ve been dealing with depression ever since high school but never discussed it with anyone until this year. Last semester I visited my school’s counseling center because I just felt so shitty. 

My depression comes in waves, so it comes and goes (which is partly the way I’ve been able to hide it for so long) but when It’s bad I spend hours just convincing myself to shower or brush my teeth. I feel so unmotivated and unhappy. 

I finally saw a counselor and explained everything I have been feeling and she suggested that I see a psychiatrist. I really want to because I don’t know if I can get through another episode and I feel one coming on soon, but I don’t know how to tell my mom that I need to see one. I am still on my parents insurance plan so they will find out regardless. 

I just don’t know how to tell my parents or my friends. I don’t want to come off as lazy or sad and I definitely don’t want them to treat me differently.
