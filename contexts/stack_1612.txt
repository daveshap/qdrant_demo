Can I test if a battery is connected to a circuit? I have a 12 V rechargeable lead acid backup battery that is connected to a circuit. When the battery is not in use there is a constant 12 V applied for charging, and when the battery is in use there is still the 12 V at the input pin. Is there any way of measuring whether the battery is connected, and if it is charging or discharging from the + pin of the battery? This all needs to be put into one circuit so anything bulky will not work.
