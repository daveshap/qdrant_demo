CONOR: I'm your future husband, remember?
MARA: I have no future husband.
CONOR: I don't understand. Not a week ago your father gave us his blessing.
MARA: My future husband died in battle against the Sutherlands.
CONOR: What are you saying? I'm standing here as real as you.
MARA: You cannot be real, Conor. You had the last rites. No man has been cut half as bad and lived.
CONOR: But I did live.
MARA: Live? In less than a week you're prancing about the country like a squirrel.
CONOR: So why the crazy talk? It's a miracle it is. Saint Andrew has smiled on me. On us.
MARA: Some think not.
CONOR: Who?
MARA: There's rumor in the village. Some call it magic.
CONOR: That's mad. Surely you don't take their word?
MARA: I don't know, Conor. It's not natural. Maybe something has touched you.
CONOR: You're sounding like that mad woman, Widow Baggins.
MARA: Me father has taken back my hand.
