How did Daisy survive this? In the season finale, when Daisy and Talbot are fighting, Talbot grabs Daisy.<blockquote class=\"spoiler\">   He then zooms thousands of feet into the air (well above the skyscrapers of Chicago, then smashes back downward hard enough to leave a crater. </blockquote>Daisy is battered and scratched (and possibly has some internal injuries, who knows), but is alive and conscious.To a lesser extent, this also occurs when she tackles Talbot, knocking him a hundred feet or so back, and hard enough to tear up the pavement, but is (in this case) completely unharmed. All this was before taking the Centipede serum, which definitely did...something. Previously, Daisy has seemed to have normal durability, being susceptible to edged weapons, bullets, and so forth. She's been shot or beaten up by regular people, for instance, subsequent to activating her powers. Why did she suffer so little injury?
