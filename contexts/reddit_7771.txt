Does anyone else get science FOMO?
Okay, so this might just be me, but does anyone else feel like they are always missing out on amazing science? like whenever I think about specializing myself in a niche area, i feel like I will miss out on other stuff that's also super interesting. I am a biochemist, but sometimes I can't help but feel like there is so much more to both biology and chemistry (and even physics sometimes) that I will never be able to truly satisfy my curiosity. I just feel like there is soooo much interesting scientific research going on and soo little time to learn about it all :/ Does anyone else feel this way? how do reconcile this feeling with dreams of obtaining a phD?
