Dealing with income gain guilt because of my immigrant family
Hi everyone,

A little backstory: I grew up with immigrants parents, both work minimum wage jobs, and this past May I was the first person in my family to graduate from college. I recently landed my first adult job and will be earning more than both of my parents ever have. 

In my culture, if I don’t take care of my parents I’m viewed as a disgrace. I want to support my parents, but I also want to establish a support network for myself so that I can break the cycle of poverty. However, now my parents are constantly asking me for money (rent, bills, home restoration, etc). I don’t live at home. Although I’m earning more money than them, it’s not enough for me to become the literal backbone of the family. How do I establish boundaries without feeling guilty? I want to spoil myself since I’ve never had much to my name but can’t live with the idea that my parents are slaving away at their minimum wage jobs while I’m financially independent. For anyone who has been in this situation, what have you done?

Thanks!
