MONICA: Your Eames table is incredible. And the B&B. I just put that in a client's home, actually, but in red.
JOE: You're an interior decorator, right?
MONICA: Sally did all this herself?
JOE: In fits and starts -- and then, later, of course, she had to accommodate me. So things shifted a little bit then, became more eclectic. And it keeps changing.
MONICA: Mmm. It says something about the two of you maybe.
JOE: Yeah, we're in a constant state of flux. I see you've moved up from the soft stuff.
MONICA: Oh, yes. You know Ryan's been sober eight years. And it's difficult if I... you know. It's better if I don't.
JOE: Uh-huh.
MONICA: I'm a little nervous, so...
JOE: Oh.
MONICA: A little out of my element.
JOE: No you're not.
MONICA: Well, yes. Yes, in fact. A little on the outside, yes. And there's been all this friction.
JOE: Hm.
MONICA: I don't know why, but these misunderstandings have a way of escalating.
JOE: Very well put.
MONICA: I think a lot of this could have been avoided if Sally made more of an effort.
JOE: What?
MONICA: But you're very private people. You know, there's a kind of elitism...
JOE: Elitism?
MONICA: The wrong word, maybe. Delete that. And, you know, the dog barks incessantly.
JOE: And you know, he really does not.
MONICA: And Ryan works at home.
JOE: And your phone calls are nasty and abusive. And I've come this close to suing you for harassment. And you're only here because we're supposed to be sucking up to you.
JOE: Oh shit. I'm sorry.
MONICA: Well, that's what Ryan thought. I was more generous, actually.
JOE: Oh shit. I'm sorry. I'm a total fucking maniac. Delete all that, okay? I spoke for myself, this needn't rub off on my wife. Oh shit. I get pissy sometimes. Much worse than Otis. Otis doesn't bite. It's just, I really love my dog and he doesn't really bark a lot. We live in a canyon. We hear dogs barking at night, too. And it's not Otis.
