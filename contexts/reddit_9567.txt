I got a job as an Academic Advisor at a CC! But need advice!
Hello!

A little background about me: Graduated with a BS Public Health last year May but have been wanting to work in student affairs prior to graduation after having an epiphany! I spent the entire year of 2019 applying to student affairs jobs, and luckily started 2020 with an Academic Advisor position for a nearby Community College! I am SO excited to begin my path! I also applied to an Ed.M in Student Affairs program and i'm awaiting a decision this month!!

But aside from that, does anyone have advice about being an Academic Advisor, specifically working with adults returning to school, minority students, etc.?

Thanks so much!!!!!
