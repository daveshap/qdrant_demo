How to childproof small table intentionally away from wall? I have a small table next to a rocking chair in my child\u2019s nursery. Once my child starts crawling and walking, I want everything in the nursery to be childproofed, including the table. While I could fasten the tab to the wall, that moves it away from the rocker, thereby defeating its purpose. Is there any way to childproof a small table that\u2019s away from walls?
