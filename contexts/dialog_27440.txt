CALLOWAY: Now then, Miss Schmidt, I'm not interested in your forged papers - that's purely a Russian case. When did you last see Lime?
ANNA: Two weeks ago.
CALLOWAY: I want the truth, Miss Schmidt. We know he is alive.
ANNA: It's true then?
CALLOWAY: Joseph Harbin's body was found in the coffin.
ANNA: What did you say? I'm sorry...
CALLOWAY: I said another man was buried in his place.
ANNA: Where's Harry?
CALLOWAY: That's what we want to find out.
ANNA: I'm sorry - I don't seem able to understand anything you say. He's alive now this minute - he's doing something.
CALLOWAY: Miss Schmidt, we know he is somewhere across the canal in the Russian sector... You may as well help us. In a few minutes Colonel Brodsky will be questioning you about your papers. Tell me where Lime is.
ANNA: I don't know.
CALLOWAY: If you help me, I am prepared to help you. ANNA Martins always said you were a fool...
CALLOWAY: Vienna is a closed city, Miss Schmidt, he can't get away.
ANNA: Poor Harry, I wish he was dead, he would be safe from all of you then.
