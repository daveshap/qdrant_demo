Meeting with the Bobs coming
Without getting into too many details, I have a desk job for a bank where I don’t necessarily do a whole lot all day, and the story is the same for others that I work with whom I’ve talked to. The company isn’t doing great financially, and I’ve long since accepted that this job is what it is for now, but take it one day at a time and don’t get too comfortable because consolidation and downsizing is almost certainly inevitable. Today they sent out an email that started out cheery and optimistic and then ended with “Oh yeah, we’re scheduling meetings over the next couple of weeks with some company that is going to give us an overview of the organization and blah blah blah”. Needless to say, it’s a bunch of bullshit to try and mask the fact that an efficiency consulting firm is coming in and at least some if not all of the people who work here will have to essentially interview for their job again.

Has anyone ever worked for a company that has done this? Do these sorts of consultants typically come in with a scalpel or an axe? I know this place has a lot of middle management that is probably overpaid and underworked, so those are the types I would assume should be nervous, but should stuff like this typically be a cause for worry for everyone from the top down and a sign of bigger changes to come?
