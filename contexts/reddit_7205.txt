Job still has me training as a machinist 2 years after hire. Still haven't done the actual job I was hired to do and I feel like they aren't allowing me to grow.
I applied to be a CNC machinist here 2 years ago, and I was hired for this position. Originally the deal that I agreed to was that I'd train on manual machines for 1 year and then move on to the CNCs. I still haven't touched a CNC machine because I'm "fine on the manual machines." This is not the job I applied for or was hired for. This is hindering my growth. What should I do?

Edit: I forgot to mention that there are still CNC openings and they are so desperate to fill them that they are bribing the employees with higher referral bonuses.
