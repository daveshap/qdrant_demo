I asked last Saturday if "Anyone there" ? You answered. Thank you. I was half way through my suicide attempt.
I was on this site last week and need someone that I didn't know.  I'm not doing well lately. I have a toxic abusive relationship, I cannot find a shrink to save my life (Literally. ha), I'm going through a divorce, my soul mate died (dog), I'm having to move states, find work, find a new home, and am living with my parents as of my psychiatric hospital release the day before yesterday.

I had been half way through, and had 2 methods essentially.  I took a medication to make it so I wasn't scared to do it. In the closet I was in, I had my phone, I'd already filled out my suicide note, and dictated in my legal will and burial details what needed to be done. I wanted to go forward.  I can't now, but think if it were again ... I would have not called for help but just let one of the methods run its course and go to sleep. I wouldn't wake up again. I am still ok with that idea.

I stood in the closet and had a fraction of a second that I was sobbing trying to pump myself up and asked if anyone was here.  It didn't save my life, but it gave me a second to think that wasn't thinking about the problem, it was writing and reading. I put \*\*\* \*\*\* down. I called my husband (STBX) and was taken by ambulance.  I was put in a hospital for a 5 day week and am now at my parents house. Everything is locked up, I have no access to anything. I don't have my car. I'm safe.

but Thank you. I wanted to tell someone what happened. I need to feel less confused about it and why or if I'm a risk, or if I'm being dramatic. I can't tell. But I can't talk about it at home. I'm sad and embarrassed to be here.
