ALISON: Jennifer can stay and look after Kevin
DAVID: Sounds great. Excellent. Though-, Ahm... there's this guy who's coming to work at the Gallery, from England...
ALISON: Yeeees?
DAVID: And they asked me if we'd like to ... you know... put him up for a while.
ALISON: There aren't hotels?
DAVID: Yes, there are hotels. They just thought maybe it'd be nice for him to stay with a real American family. Popcorn, waffles, all that stuff.
ALISON: And what did you say?
DAVID: I said I'd check with you.
