SPOCK: 10 million years earlier. Humpbacks were heavily hunted by Man. They have been extinct since the 21st Century... It is possible that an alien intelligence sent the probe to determine why they lost contact.
BONES: ... My God...
KIRK: Spock, could the Humpback's answer to this call be simulated?
SPOCK: The sounds, but not the language. We would be responding in gibberish.
KIRK: Is there any other planet where this species exists?
SPOCK: The Humpback was indigenous to Earth. Earth of the past.
KIRK: That leaves us no choice. We must destroy the probe before it destroys Earth.
SPOCK: That would be futile, Admiral. The probe would neutralize us easily.
KIRK: But we can't turn away! Is there no alternative?
SPOCK: There is one, but I cannot guarantee its success. We could attempt to find some Humpback Whales.
BONES: You just said there aren't any except on Earth of the past.
SPOCK: That is what I said, Doctor.
BONES: Then how.?
BONES: Now wait just a damn minute.
KIRK: Spock, start your computations for time warp. Come on, Bones. Let's pay Scotty a visit.
KIRK: Scotty, how long is this bay?
SCOTTY: About 60 feet, Admiral.
KIRK: That should be enough. Can you enclose it to hold water?
SCOTTY: I suppose I can, sir; are you planning to take a swim?
