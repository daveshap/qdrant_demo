Is there a word for when racism is used in a power dynamic? I am wondering if there is a specific word that can reference a type of racism used through abusing a socioeconomic power dynamic wherein one group controls vastly more resources than another. I thought I heard of such before, but I cannot remember it. Example sentence:<blockquote>  Due to the ______ that oppresses this racial group, the resulting socioeconomic disparity has caused higher unemployment, higher incarceration rates and increased victimization.</blockquote>
