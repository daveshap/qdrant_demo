CAROLINE'S VOICE: Yes, Mr. Lowery.
LOWERY'S VOICE: Caroline...? Mary still isn't in?
CAROLINE'S VOICE: No, Mr. Lowery... but then she's always a bit late on Monday mornings.
LOWERY'S VOICE: Buzz me the minute she comes in.
LOWERY'S VOICE: Call her sister! If no one's answering at the house....
CAROLINE'S VOICE: I called her sister, Mr. Lowery, where she works, the Music Makers Music Store, you know? And she doesn't know where Mary is any more than we do.
LOWERY'S VOICE: You better run out to the house. She may be... unable to answer the phone...
CAROLINE'S VOICE: Her sister's going to do that. She's as worried as we are.
