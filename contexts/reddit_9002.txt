Following President Trump's [private meeting](https://apnews.com/afd7db4f7c024a678c696da68edd15ce) with Putin in Helsinki, [Senate Democrats expressed concerns](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/07/19/helsinki-summit-democrats-want-hear-trumps-interpreter/799733002/) about the meeting and requested the interpreter testify before them in a closed session so they could ascertain what, if anything, was agreed to.  

Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee also attempted to subpoena the interpreter, but were [blocked by the Republicans on the Committee.](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/republicans-block-democrat-attempt-subpoena-trump-interpreter/story?id=56687970) 

Based on this, a few questions arise:

1. Is is legal to force an interpreter for the President to testify via subpoena?

2. Are there ethical complications in doing so?

3. Is there precedent for calling an interpreter to testify?
