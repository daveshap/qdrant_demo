I'm boring
I'm really boring, I'm not ambitious, I'm not passionate about anything and I don't have many interests. I'm not a fun person to be around, talk to or text to. 

I can never think of something to say even if I'm with someone who I'm really comfortable with, even if I do think of something it's never going to be anything interesting. I don't understand why anyone would want to be around me and I don't know how to change myself.
