Anyone else stuck in a high covid19 risk, low paying job with no options?
So I work at a casino, I've worked there for 7 years in housekeeping. Ive invested so much time and work here getting a good reputation and my annual raises have added up over the years. I don't love it but I've had FAR worse employers.

If I left my job its unlikely I will be rehired and my workplace is one of very few in the area that pays a decent wage for someone with no real skills. 

I am terrified of leaving because I know all that awaits are minimum wage jobs and bosses that won't treat me as well as they do at the casino....yet I know that getting covid19 is only a matter of time.

It feels like someone is pointing a gun at me but they won't tell me when they are going to shoot or how lethal of a spot they will aim.

I just cant believe they allowed casinos to be open, they should be shut down for a few years and I should be getting unemployment. And I'm not saying that because I'm lazy.

I have too much into my job and there are no good employers in my area...its way too much risk for me to leave what little I have.

Anyone else just plain stuck at a high risk job just waiting for your number to be pulled? 

The worst part is I'm just stuck here to continue to work hard and sweat for my poverty level wages and I could bring this back to my father who is over 50
