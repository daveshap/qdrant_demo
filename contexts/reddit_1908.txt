Rising Seniors - You don't need to apply to 20 schools. I promise.
For context, I am a CO 2020 graduate, National Merit Commended scholar, straight-A student, SAT 1460, with many extracurriculars and a 30 hr/wk job in fast-food management. In all honesty, I could have applied to T20s and had a fair shot. My college list consisted of 17 schools this time last year, including local schools, some ivies, a few UCs, and other notable schools such as Northeastern, Stanford, and NYU. But then I realized, if accepted, I didn't want to go to ANY of these prestigious schools. Some of them didn't even have my major. I was literally just applying to see if I could get in, and it was going to cost me hundreds of dollars and lots of unnecessary stress. DO NOT DO THIS. I promise you. Have your dream school, 2-3 reaches, and a few safeties. I applied to 4 schools, accepted to all, including a full-ride to a private university, ranked T100, which I accepted. I turned out FINE, finished my applications by October, and had very very very little stress. I recommend this approach to everyone. Don't kill yourself over college admissions. At the end of the day, you only choose one school, make it one you actually want to be at.
