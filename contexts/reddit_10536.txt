How the fuck do you hold conversation?
I have this problem where I can't really make any new friends thanks to me, failing to hold conversation. I'm sick of relying other people to be very talkative and just responding with filler words. Ive been stuck with the same friends for years. Don't get me wrong I'm thankful to have them in the first place but I feel like I'm starting to grow apart from them. I feel so alone and its all my fault. Thanks to me, struggling with meeting new people, keep eye contact, talk until you're comfortable with them etc. There are times where I just feel like I rather be alone than to talk to people. But why do I feel like this? I don't want to be by myself but sometimes I can't help but to only have myself as company.

There are times I know the other person just doesn't want to talk to me because I bring up generic topics to talk about (how are you doing? Any plans for today? What are you up to now?). But I don't know how to talk... I've been like this for years now. 

I don't want to stay alone because I end up overthinking everything and think the world hates me. Why the fuck am I like this? I need help!
