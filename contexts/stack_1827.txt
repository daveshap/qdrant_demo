With all due respect to Can you use the phrase 'with all due respect' and then follow it up with a name? Take this example:With all due respect to Charlotte Bront\u00eb, I thought Jane Eyre was terrible.I have never heard anyone use this construction before, but I am trying to figure out if it is technically wrong or if it is an accepted usage.
