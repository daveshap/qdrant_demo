PAUL: Will we see a worm?
KYNES: Where there is spice and spice mining there are always worms.
PAUL: Always?
KYNES: Always.
PAUL: Why do they come?
KYNES: To protect their territory. Vibrations attract them. -- PAUL I've registered him now... a knife is a sheath on his left arm... He's strong... a person born to command... He's hiding many things. Is there a relationship between the worms and the spice?
