CRABBIN: Yes, Hindu dances, thank you, Sergeant. This is the first opportunity we've had of making an American author welcome.
MARTINS: Welcome?
CRABBIN: I'll tell you what, Mr. Martins. On Wednesday night at our institute, we are having a little lecture on the contemporary novel...I thought perhaps you'd like to speak.
MARTINS: They wouldn't know me.
CRABBIN: Nonsense. Your novels are very popular here. Aren't they, Sergeant?
PAINE: Very popular, sir.
CRABBIN: Very popular. Are you staying long?
MARTINS: How long can one stay here on this stage money?
CRABBIN: Listen, Mr. Martins, if you'd agree to be our guest, we'd be delighted to have you.
