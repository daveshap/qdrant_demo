GALVIN: Please sit down. I told your wife. I'm sorry that we have to meet out here. I've got a case coming in two days in the Superior Court and my office is a mess of papers.
DONEGHY: ...that's all right.
GALVIN: I was telling your wife, we have a very good case here.
SALLY: He saw her at the Northern Care...
GALVIN: ...and I have inquiries out to doctors, experts in the field... there is, of course, a problem getting a doctor to testify that another doctor's negligent...
DONEGHY: ...the Archdiocese called up, they said who was our attorney, 'cause the case is coming to trial...
GALVIN: I doubt we'll have to go to trial...
DONEGHY: ...we told them we didn't want it to come out this way.
GALVIN: I completely understand...
DONEGHY: We just...
SALLY: We just can't do it anymore. This is our chance to get away.
GALVIN: I'm going to see you get that chance.
DONEGHY: What is this going to cost?
GALVIN: It's completely done on a contingency basis. That means whatever the settlement is I retain one-third... that is, of course, the usual arrangement...
