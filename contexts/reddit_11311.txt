my life
I've always been big and unattractive my whole 16 years. I've tried to lose weight multiple times and even now I'm trying, but I'm stuck after losing 20 pounds. When I thought I had a chance to date someone once we met up she stopped talking to me. I suck at every game even though I spend most of my time playing games. Even the game I have over 400 hours in I am bad. All my friends got valorant beta key except me so I'm left out. I'm trying to learn a language, but can't remember anything. I tried to graduate highschool a year early, but corona has me out of school and I can't get my work done. I honestly would kill my self if I had the will power.
