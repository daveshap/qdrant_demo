Should I take this job or wait?
I applied for a job at my local ups store the other day and got a fast response. They really want me to come interview ASAP. The employer offers $14/ hr full time with benefits. i was making $17/ hr at my last job. Unfortunately I have been out of work since March on unemployment and what’s even worse is that I make more money being unemployed then I do having a job. I have been getting $1750 every two weeks in unemployment which is $329/ week regular unemployment + pandemic relief (lasts until end of July) added onto that. If I take the job my income will drop to around $1100 every two weeks. I explained the situation to my family asking for advise and they told me to hold off on a job until the end of July. They believe that is the best thing for me to do. I’m not sure what I want to do or what the smartest thing to do should be.
