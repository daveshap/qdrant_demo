Friend of mine came to me saying he hit his girlfriend
So an old friend came to me saying he had to get something off his chest. Not too long ago, he had physically harmed his girlfriend in a few instances, once in self-defense and once as the initial instigator. He showed true remorse in his actions, though said he is afraid of what he is capable of, and it sounded like he isn't sure if he will be able to prevent himself from doing it in the future.

I'm no mental health expert, but we've talked about issues he's had with his dad and how he treated his mom, so I encouraged him to not hate himself for it, but took a soft yet firm anti-abuse stance, urging him that if he isn't sure that if he isn't sure that he can control himself next time, to do whatever he could to prevent a situation like that from happening, even if that meant breaking up with his girlfriend. He's had some issues with mental health in the past, but this is the first time he's told me that he physically hurt someone. He's my friend and I love him, but I am worried that he could let his anger get out of hand. I know someone else who was a victim of abuse, and I want to do what I can to make sure it doesn't continue. He's had on and off mental health issues, going through several therapists in the past, and I worry about him. No matter what, I'll be there for him, but I want to make sure that I'm there for him in the right way. Is there anything else I could do for him, or say to him?
