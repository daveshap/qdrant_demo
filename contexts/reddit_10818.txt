I feel guilty for thinking about suicide due to the pandemic
I just want to die i want everything to be over with. i’m not doing my online classes , i’m not doing any of my school work. i’m going to fail and have to retake the year all because i lack motivation and i’m just fucking lazy. I can’t even communicate that i need help with anyone and i don’t want to either it’s just so hard. i just want to die. I hate this and don’t want to continue any longer i just feel guilty to even think of suicide at times like this cause i feel like i’m just be wasting everyone’s time and being a disturbance when people have bigger things and problems to deal with. i want to go to A&E just to try to not harm myself but i know they don’t have time for someone like me when there’s many people who are in need of critical help.
