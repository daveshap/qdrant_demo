Sleep mode drains battery very fast Battery drains in about 10 hours when the computer is asleep with Ubuntu 18.04, it is a lenovo y520 (7700hq, 1060 with bumblebee).<br>When I tested no USB devices were plugged in, actually nothing was plugged in.<br>The sleep mode is s2 - deep. I am not interested in hibernation (it is quite slow and takes a lot of space).<br>In windows and Mac OS (hackintosh) sleep mode uses 1 or 2% of battery in a day.
