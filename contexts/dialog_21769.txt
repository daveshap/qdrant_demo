JAKE: What're you lookin' at? You lookin' at him?
VICKIE: No, I'm not. I'm looking at you.
JAKE: Don't tell me No." I saw you lookin' at him. Why
VICKIE: I'm not interested in him.
JAKE: You're not interested in him?
VICKIE: No, I'm not.
JAKE: In other words, you're not interested in him but you'd be interested in somebody else, right?
VICKIE: Jake, c'mon now. Don't start.
JAKE: Look at this, all of a sudden everybody's a fuckin' Romeo around here. Did you see the way she was lookin' at him?
JOEY: Nah, she would never...
JAKE: Didn't you just see her lookin' at him? She told me no, but I don't believe her.
JOEY: C'mon, Jake. You know she's crazy about you.
