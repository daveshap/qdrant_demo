Anyone else with anxiety have a crippling fear of confrontation?

I would actually say the worst symptom of anxiety for me is a fear of confrontation.  Even when I'm 100% in the right, having to call someone out on their bullshit can be enough to induce a panic attack.

Its only gotten worse with age.  When I was a little bit younger I"d push through the anxiety and make sure my voice was heard, I would say avoiding confrontation is a behavior I've learned over the years and now it's almost impossible for me to confront someone without stuttering and stammering through it, and that is if I even have the balls to confront someone in the first place.  

 

Then, I wind up even more pissed off and upset because I end up letting someone walk all over me and then my anxiety gets even worse, or I just shut down and get super depressed.

I just started therapy for my anxiety, am wondering if anyone with similar fears has had success through therapy and beating this type of anxiety
