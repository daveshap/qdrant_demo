Changing date format in field name from d2000_5000 to Dddmmyyyy? I am trying to change the name of a field by using Python code where the current name is in the format (e.g.) d2000_5000, and 5000 is the decimal year (0,5 y) added to 2000. So i think that this can be done with the Alter Field tool, by extracting characters, then doing 365*5000/10000 to obtain days, and then adding these days to the initial date of 2000: 2000-01-01 + days (within a date sum that takes into account years with 29 days in Feb).Somebody can help me proposing a code snip to do it?
