ELENA: Thanks again. For the dinner.
JANEY: Thanks for eating it. I don't know why I even pretend I can cook.
ELENA: I used to know how to cook.
JANEY: It's not like we're too busy.
ELENA: I'm thinking of going back to school.
JANEY: Social work?
ELENA: How'd you know?
JANEY: Educated guess.
ELENA: I'm that predictable? No, you don't have to answer that. It's just that with the kids almost grown --
JANEY: You don't have to apologize. I'm too much of a cynic. You actually seem to be trying to figure things out -- don't mind me.
JANEY: Here you are.
ELENA: Thanks for the lift. If the bike's any bother--
JANEY: None at all. I'll leave it in front of your garage. Happy Thanksgiving.
