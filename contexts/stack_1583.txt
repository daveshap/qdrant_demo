Light source that withstands extreme conditions I am designing an aircraft obstruction light, and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) requires crazy requirements for their standards. One standard goes as following (From FAA AC 150/5345-43H):<blockquote>  4.2.2 High temperature test    1... The equipment must be subjected to a constant temperature of +130F (+55C) for 4 hours after equipment temperature stabilization and be operated throughout the test.    4.2.3 Low temperature test    1... The equipment must be placed in a chamber that maintains a temperature of -67 degrees F (-55 C) for shipping/storage requirements and -40 F (-40 C) for equipment operational requirements.</blockquote>Does such a light source exist in this world? Do they have a specific name? My searches on Google was misleading so far, \"military grade led\" led me to torches, \"cold led\" led me to cool-white LEDs.
