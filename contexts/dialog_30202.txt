GALVIN: I have to talk to you.
MICKEY: What do you want?
GALVIN: Come on. Let's get a drink.
MICKEY: Don't touch anything.
MICKEY: Are you out of your mind...?
GALVIN: ...I'm going to need your help...
MICKEY: You need my help...? You need a goddamn keeper... are you telling me that you turned down two-hundred-ten grand? Huh...? Are you nuts? Eh? Are you nuts. What are you going to do, bring her back to life?
GALVIN: I'm going to help her.
MICKEY: To do what...? To do what, for chrissake...? To help her to do what? She's dead...
GALVIN: They killed her. And they're trying to buy it...
MICKEY: That's the point, you stupid fuck. Let them buy it. We let them buy the case. That's what I took it for. You let this drop -- we'll go up to New Hampshire, kill some fuckin' deer...
GALVIN: Mick. Mick. Mick...
MICKEY: What?
GALVIN: You -- Listen: you said to me, 'if not now, when...'
MICKEY: I know what I said but not now. You won it. Franky. You won it. When they give you the money, that means that you won. We don't want to go to court -- is this getting to you...?
GALVIN: ...he's a good man...
MICKEY: ...he's a good man...? He's the Prince of Fuckin' Darkness... he'll have people in there testifying that the broad is well -- they saw her Tuesday on a surfboard at Hyannis... don't fuck with this case.
GALVIN: ...I have to stand up for her...
MICKEY: Frank, but not now. Frank. You're trying to wipe out some old business. But not now. I understand. But you go call 'em back. You call the Bishop back.
GALVIN: I have to try this case. I have to do it, Mick. I've got to stand up for that girl. I need your help. Mick, will you help me...? Will you help me...?
