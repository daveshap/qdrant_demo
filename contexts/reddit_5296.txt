Is your boss allowed to read personal notes you've written to yourself on company time?
So I have a pretty boring job and sometimes out of boredom I'll write jokes to myself or little notes to help me write a joke later. Usually I do this on my phone but my boss caught me and told me to not do this at my desk. Now I handwrite these notes and so today I simply wrote "boner nipples" as a reminder to flesh that idea out later at home so I won't forget. Well my boss happened to be looking over my shoulder, read it, and gave me a warning about writing inappropriate things at work. Is this allowed? I feel like it's an invasion of privacy but I really don't know. Sorry if this isn't the right place to ask or the right flair but any suggestion and info is appreciated.
