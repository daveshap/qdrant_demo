RAY: He makes you feel pretty unhappy?
JUDY: He calls me a dirty tramp--my own father!
RAY: Do you think your father means that?
JUDY: Yes! I don't know! I mean maybe he doesn't mean it but he acts like he does. We're altogether and we're going to celebrate Easter and catch a double bill. Big deal. So I put on my new dress and I came out and he--
RAY: That one?
JUDY: Yes--he started yelling for a handkerchief--screaming. He grabbed my face and he rubbed all my lipstick off--he rubbed till I thought I wouldn't have any lips left. And all the time yelling at me--that thing--the thing I told you he called me. Then I ran out of the house.
RAY: Is that why you were wandering around at one o'clock in the morning?
JUDY: I was just talking a walk. I tried to call the kids but everybody was out and I couldn't find them. I hate my life. I just hate it.
RAY: You weren't looking for company, were you?
JUDY: No.
RAY: Did you stop to talk to anyone, Judy? Do you enjoy that?
JUDY: No. I don't even know why I do it.
RAY: Do you think you can get back at your Dad that way? I mean sometimes if we can't get as close to somebody as we'd like we have to try making them jealous--so they'll have to pay attention. Did you ever think of that?
JUDY: I'll never get close to anybody.
RAY: Some kids stomped a man on Twelfth Street, Judy.
JUDY: You know where they picked me up! Twelfth Street! I wasn't even near there!
RAY: Would you like to go home if we can arrange it? Did you notify the parents?
