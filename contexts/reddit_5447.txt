I work at a relatively prestigious art museum. What Master's should I pursue to progress my career at this (or another) museum?
I have a B.S. in International Studies and various certifications with art-based credits due to the classes I have taken while at my position.

My resume makes me appear more "business" and less "design and color theory", which is a field that I excel in. My current position is Entry Level - more like a low level intern. I participate in every non-mandatory (Zoom) meeting, and take on various projects voluntarily. I also help the Events Team with everything from manually setting up the event (AV type stuff/some heavy lifting) to designing bouquets to be placed on the tables of prestigious guests.

Any advice on how I could progress?

You guys are the best, thanks!

Edit: weird grammar
