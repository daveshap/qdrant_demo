Does your degree really matter?
I was always told growing up that whatever you have a degree in that it didn't matter as all degrees are really the same anyway.

Now I work in an unrelated field to my major  but most companies specify that they require a major in my current field. After having a couple years of experience in the field, does my major really matter?
