Successful defense!
I had my MS thesis defense yesterday (on Zoom, of course), and I'm proud to say that I passed! I have some revisions to make on my thesis manuscript, but overall the defense-- and specifically, the questions asked of me both by the audience and my committee-- weren't nearly as bad as I thought they would be. As a geology student, I think I can safely say that, with all that's gone on research-wise in the last two years, the experience of doing a Master's degree rocked.
