Did I inadvertently anger some PIs?
So I got accepted to Grad school in chemistry this year. My acceptance came in January, and the school of course had the April 15th deadline for me to send my decision.
When I got the acceptance, I had received an email from a PI whom I had mentioned in my SOP. I really do like his research, and in his email he had mentioned that I would be a fit for his lab. Now, this happened in late Jan. I was still waiting on a few other schools, and so, I replied that I was interested, and that I would contact with more questions 'once my admissions had been processed'. 


Fast forward to now. I accepted the offer in April before the deadline. Due to Covid-related issues, I got busy with my work, and didn't prioritise emailing the PIs in my grad school till today ( session starts in Fall anyways, so I wasn't in a hurry). 
However, now, I'm not getting any reply (including the PI to whom I'd said I'd contact later. )

So, uh, is this normal or not? It has been just one day, so I guess they may have been busy , or did I annoy them by not contacting earlier / "being more enthusiastic" ?
