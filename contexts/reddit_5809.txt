5 months, only a few phone interviews and one in person interview. I’m discouraged, depressed and struggling to find the motivation to keep going.
Graduated with a BS in Social Sciences, looking at Marketing, Sales, HR. 

I’m so incredibly discouraged, I just finished an exploratory phone-interview with a company I have some connections in. Even after the HR manager told me she’s sending my resume along to 4 marketing managers I still feel like I won’t get an offer or let alone an interview. My confidence is in shambles, It’s hard for me to boast about myself in an interview. 

I’m lost and I don’t know what to do anymore.
