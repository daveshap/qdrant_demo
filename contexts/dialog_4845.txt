FRANK: C'mon, Tom, pick up a job.
WALLS: You want some bum in the bus terminal? We'll wait for a real call.
FRANK: Let's get in a fight, then.
WALLS: Who with?
FRANK: That's your job. Just keep driving, keep moving. No stopping. We're sharks. We stop too long, we die.
FRANK: Let's break something, Tom. Let's bust something, bomb something.
WALLS: What do you want to break?
FRANK: I don't know--let's break some windows.
WALLS: Why?
FRANK: Destruction, distraction. I feel the need.
WALLS: You need a reason, Frank. You don't just go around breaking people's windows. That's anarchy.
FRANK: What's the reason? Give me a reason, Tom.
WALLS: Let me think.
