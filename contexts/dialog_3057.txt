ROBIN: She's definitely part of this. It's weird, for a while Ivy was all I could think about. But then...
BATMAN: I know. The feeling just vanished.
ROBIN: I can't believe we were fighting over a bad guy.
BATMAN: Bad, yes. Guy, no. This is one majorly beautiful evil person.
ROBIN: I'm totally over her. Positively.
BATMAN: Me too. Great stems, though.
ROBIN: Umm-hmmmm.
BATMAN: Definitely.
ROBIN: How did you...?
BATMAN: Open Sesame...Chicken.
BATMAN: She's still alive. He's adapted his freezing technology to reverse McGregor's Syndrome. He's even found a cure for the early stages of the disease.
ROBIN: Can he save her?
BATMAN: No. Her case is too advanced. But maybe, someday, with more research-
BATMAN: No beauty...
ROBIN: Just the beast.
