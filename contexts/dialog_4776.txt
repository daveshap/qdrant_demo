LIME: No, you can't have any more chairs! There's only one left in here now, and I need that to sit on! Oh ... er, sorry. Who are you?
SAM: Sam Lowry.
LIME: Ah, yes, you're the new boy from next door, ha ha! My name's Lime. Harvey Lime. Welcome to Expediting.
SAM: Ah. Would you mind if I borrowed your computer console?
LIME: What?
SAM: I'll bring it back in ten minutes.
LIME: You want to take my console into your office?
SAM: Yes.
LIME: I'll tell you what .... You tell me what and I'll do it for. I'm a bit of a whizz on this thing.
SAM: Alright. There's someone I want to check out. A woman called Gillian Layton.
LIME: A woman eh? I see.
SAM: I know her age and distinguishing marks. But I need an address or a place of work or something
LIME: This is your dream girl, is it?
SAM: What? Look, let me use the console for a few minutes.
LIME: You must be joking - When there's a woman involved - there's no stopping me. Now, let me have that sheet.
LIME: Sod it, it's broken!
SAM: You haven't switched it on.
LIME: Oh - yes. Look you're putting me off, standing there! Go back to your office and I'll give you a knock when I've finished.
