Does your companies Glassdoor review realistically represent what its like to actually work there?
Too positive? Too negative? Just right? I'm curious to know how accurate you believe your companies online appearance is. I'm just trying to figure out how much stock I should be putting into company reviews on my job search.

I think my current company is well represented, some comments I feel are a bit ridiculous, but for the most part, it's pretty close, if not a bit too positive (we were all asked to publish a Glassdoor review to combat a few negative reviews from disgruntled workers).
