I've been trying to relocate and having a hard time landing anything beyond a phone interview, who has had success in this and how have you gone about it?
My boyfriend and I have been talking about relocating pretty seriously for a couple of months now.  I have been on a war path to tailor my resume to jobs, same with cover letters, and have gotten nothing but commission only sales positions calling me (of which I did not apply for).

Obviously I can't just move without a job.  We are considering getting restaurant gigs so we are at least "local" and can take an interview easily.  We are both newer in our career paths, so its not like either of us have any sort of senior level experience that people are jumping on.  We are just trying to secure our future in an area we find more desirable, as well as learn a little about ourselves in the process!

Its getting so frustrating because I am striking out left and right.  I've had folks tell me that although they believe that I sound very serious about what I am trying to do, we look like a risk because we aren't already living somewhere - how am I supposed to get a place to live without a job?!  I understand the risks in it for everyone involved.  I need some serious guidance on how to make this happen though.
