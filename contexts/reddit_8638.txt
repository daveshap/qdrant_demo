Which, if any, political groups have aligned themselves with the Democratic party, but their ideologies have been denounced by the party's leadership?
Nazi and fascist groups frequently [associate themselves](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/06/29/arthur-jones-nazi-illinois-republicans-686875) with the Republican party (at least significantly more often than the Democratic party). Despite some recent rhetoric, these groups' ideologies are decried by the mainstream Republican leadership [1](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/racist-republican-russell-walker-god-gop-white-supremacist-antisemitism-jewish-satan-north-carolina-a8421861.html) [2](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/15/donald-trump-charlottesville-republicans-react-bigotry) [3](https://gop.com/platform/we-the-people/).

What (if any) similar examples exists for the left, where political groups align themselves with the Democratic party but their ideologies are decried by party leadership?

This question is about the denunciation of the group's ideology, rather than it's actions; i.e., examples of denouncing violent action isn't the same as denouncing the underlying ideology.
