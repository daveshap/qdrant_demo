RECEPTIONIST: Hello, Sandman.
LOGAN: Hello.
RECEPTIONIST: Do you want to see Doc?
RECEPTIONIST: We don't get many Sandmen. I think we've only had one other since I've been here.
LOGAN: A Sandman can get as sick of his face as anyone else. Where's the doctor?
RECEPTIONIST: I like your face. Would you mind if Doc took a picture? I'd like him to give your face to somebody else.
LOGAN: It's all right with me. Is he here?
RECEPTIONIST: My name's Holly... Holly 13. In ancient times they said my number was unlucky. Do you believe in luck?
LOGAN: No -- Look, I'm in a hurry.
