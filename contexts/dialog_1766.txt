QUEEN: Bala has always been a hopeless romantic, General.
BALA: It's just that -- well, I'm honored that you selected me, and everything, I just thought the marriage might go a little more smoothly if -- we had a conversation?
FORMICA: Conversation...yes...well... Wasn't she briefed?
QUEEN: Look, General! A darling baby soldier! Don't try to be a hero! Just make sure you come back in one piece! Next!
FORMICA: I'll take your suggestion under advisement, Princess. In the meanwhile --
BALA: General -- we have to talk sometime!
FORMICA: Very well. Carpenter, is there a convenient time to talk vis-a-vis: relationship?
CARPENTER: Actually, sir, we're ahead of schedule. We have thirty-six seconds available right now.
FORMICA: Outstanding. Princess...?
BALA: So, um...how was your day? What did you do?
FORMICA: Well... I declared war!
BALA: Oh...and I was afraid we had nothing in common...
CARPENTER: Fourteen-fifty hours, sir.
FORMICA: Duty calls!
