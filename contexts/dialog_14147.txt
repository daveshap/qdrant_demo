PETER: Something must have gone wrong. I guess I'll try number two.
ELLIE: When you get up to a hundred, wake me up.
PETER: I guess maybe I won't write that book after all.
ELLIE: Yes. But look at all the fun you had. Mind if I try?
PETER: You! Don't make me laugh.
ELLIE: You're such a smart aleck! Nobody can do anything but you. I'll show you how to stop a carâ€”and I won't use my thumb.
PETER: What're you going to do?
ELLIE: Mind your own business.
ELLIE: You might give me a little credit.
PETER: What for?
ELLIE: I proved once and for all that the limb is mightier than the thumb.
PETER: Why didn't you take all your clothes off? You could have stopped forty cars.
ELLIE: We don't need forty cars.
