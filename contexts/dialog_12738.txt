MR. NORTH: Morning Mr. North
TAUPIN: Same.
MR. NORTH: Such a pretty day. If I live to be 90 I'll never tire of mornings like this. Mind you I'm 74 now.
TAUPIN: No.
MR. NORTH: Yes sir. When you get older your priorities change. It's the simple things that count. Without them growing old can be a very lonely thing.
TAUPIN: I'm sure that's true.
TAUPIN: Here. The hook should go just below the head, where the meat is toughest.
GRANDSON: Thanks.
