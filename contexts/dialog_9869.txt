HARRY: Honest. When you were up there, you were really... there, know what I mean? Everyone else looked stupid.
FRANCES: I don't know... I did... feel different... Alive.
HARRY: Yeah, it's a gift. You gotta do something with it.
FRANCES: Yeah, but if I win this trip, Mama'll kill me. She hates Russians. I do want to go, though... to New York, especially... but I wanted to do it...
HARRY: What?
FRANCES: Quietly.
HARRY: You're not the quiet type, Frances.
HARRY: You know, my old man was an inventor. Spent his whole life down in the basement trying to design transcontinental underground railroads, stuff like that. Well, I was supposed to be his partner. When I told him the smell of his workshop made me sick, I thought he was going to die right there.
FRANCES: What happened to him?
HARRY: He retired to Florida... made a killing in vending machines.
HARRY: I kick myself sometimes, but the thing is, I would have been miserable living his life.
FRANCES: ...So you think I should go.
HARRY: Sure. Try this acting thing. You can make good money at it.
FRANCES: I don't know, Harry. I... I want so many...
HARRY: You don't know what you want.
FRANCES: Yeah.
