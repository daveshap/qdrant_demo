BEEFY: Makin' friends already.
NICKY: It's freezing up here, Beefy.
BEEFY: You're on Earth now, kid. Gonna have the same physical needs and limitations a human has. We'll stop by K-mart. Get you some warm clothes.
NICKY: I also have this odd pain in my mid section. Kind of a hollow feeling...
BEEFY: That pain is hunger.
NICKY: So far, so good. Now what?
BEEFY: Put it in your mouth.
