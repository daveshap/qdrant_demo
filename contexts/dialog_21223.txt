JENNIFER: I'm gonna hurl, David. I swear to God.
DAVID: Just take deep breaths.
JENNIFER: All that animal fat. I feel it in my pores or something.
JENNIFER: I still don't see why we're doing this.
DAVID: We're supposed to be in school.
JENNIFER: We're supposed to be at home David! We're supposed to be in color! Oh God ...
MR. SIMPSON: Hello Bud.
DAVID: Hello Mr. Simpson.
MR. SIMPSON: Hear your Dad got a new car.
DAVID: Oh yeah. A Buick. It's swell.
JENNIFER: You know him?
DAVID: Owns the hardware store.
JENNIFER: Okay, now you listen to me! I don't know what's going on but you'd better fix it! I had a date with Mark Davis and I even bought new UNDERWEAR!
DAVID: We just gotta play along for a little while ... till that guy shows up again. Then I'll talk to him and ...
JENNIFER: Play along?
DAVID: Well, yeah. I'm ... Bud Parker and you're ... um--Mary Sue.
JENNIFER: No! I'm not gonna do it! If I don't dress like this for Mom I'm sure as hell not going to do it for you!
DAVID: We don't have a choice Jen. We're stuck until he comes back.
JENNIFER: Why can't we just EXPLAIN IT?
DAVID: To who?
