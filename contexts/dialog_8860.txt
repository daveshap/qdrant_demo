MERRIN: Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day, our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation.
KARRAS: But deliver us from the evil one.
MERRIN: Save me o' God by thy name, by thy might defend my cause, proud men have risen up against me, men of violence seek my life, but God is my helper, the Lord sustains my life and every need he has delivered to me, glory be to the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.
KARRAS: As it was in the begin is now and ever shall be, world without end, amen.
MERRIN: Save your servant
KARRAS: Who places her trust in thee, my God.
MERRIN: Be unto her o' Lord a fortified tower.
KARRAS: In the face of the enemy.
MERRIN: Let the enemy have no power over her.
KARRAS: And the son of iniquity be powerless to harm her.
REGAN/DEMON: Your mother sucks cocks in hell Karras, you faithless slime!
MERRIN: O'Lord hear my prey.
KARRAS: And let my cry come unto thee.
MERRIN: The Lord be with you.
KARRAS: And also with you.
MERRIN: Let us pray. Holy Lord, almighty Father, everlasting God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who once and for all consigned that fallen tyrant to the flames of hell. Who sent your only begotten son into the world to crush that roaring lion.
