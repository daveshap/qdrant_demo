MICHAEL: I'm Michael Corleone--this is my father. What happened to the detectives who were guarding him?
NURSE: Oh your father just had too many visitors. It interfered with the hospital service. The police came and made them all leave just ten minutes ago. But don't worry. I look in on him.
MICHAEL: You just stand here one minute...
MICHAEL: Sonny...Sonny--Jesus Christ, I'm down at the hospital. I came down late. There's no one here. None of Tessio's people--no detectives, no one. The old man is completely unprotected.
SONNY: All right, get him in a different room; lock the door from the inside. I'll have some men there inside of fifteen minutes. Sit tight, and don't panic.
MICHAEL: I won't panic.
NURSE: You cannot stay here...I'm sorry.
MICHAEL: You and I are going to move my father right now...to another room on another floor...Can you disconnect those tubes so we can wheel the bed out?
NURSE: Absolutely not! We have to get permission from the Doctor.
MICHAEL: You've read about my father in the papers. You've seen that no one's here to guard him. Now I've just gotten word that men are coming to this hospital to kill him. Believe me and help me.
NURSE: We don't have to disconnect them, we can wheel the stand with the bed.
