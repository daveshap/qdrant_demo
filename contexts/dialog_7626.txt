JIM CUNNINGHAM: I think you are afraid to ask me for advice. I think that you are a very troubled... confused young man. I think you're searching for answers in all the wrong places.
DONNIE: Well, I think you're the fucking Anti-Christ.
DONNIE: They suspended me for two days.
GRETCHEN: Are you okay?
DONNIE: I've been seeing stuff... a lot of really messed-up stuff. Do you know who Grandma Death is?
GRETCHEN: Who?
DONNIE: The old crazy woman who lives off Old Gun Road.
GRETCHEN: Oh, yeah. The Philosophy of Time Travel". What is this?"
DONNIE: She wrote it. There are chapters in this book that describe the stuff I've been seeing. It can't just be a coincidence. Will you come see her with me?
DONNIE: I know she's here. She never leaves the house.
GRETCHEN: Maybe she's asleep.
