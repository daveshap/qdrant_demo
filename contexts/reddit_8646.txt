Are Donald Trump's statements concerning Michael Cohen examples of witness tampering?
President Trump's former attorney, [Michael Cohen, said on Wednesday that he will delay his testimony to Congress](https://www.npr.org/2019/01/23/687821794/trumps-ex-attorney-cohen-postpones-hill-testimony-citing-ongoing-threats). He cited 'threats' as the reason. His attorney cited 'ongoing threats'.

Cohen appears to have some Congressional support for his assertion of 'threats' by the President:

> Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland — chairman of the oversight committee — and Rep. Adam Schiff of California — chairman of the intelligence committee — also echoed earlier criticism of Trump for what they suggested was obstruction of justice and witness tampering.

> "As we stated previously with our colleague, Chairman Jerry Nadler of the Judiciary Committee, efforts to intimidate witnesses, scare their family members, or prevent them from testifying before Congress are textbook mob tactics that we condemn in the strongest terms," Cummings and Schiff said.

Representative Ted Liu made [a similar assertion on witness tampering](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/426672-dem-lawmaker-cites-law-against-witness-tampering-after-cohen-cancels-testimony).

Trump's response is that Cohen "has been threatened by the truth."

Some Congressional Republicans also dismissed Democrat's assertions of witness tampering (Citation 3, NY Times):

> The president’s allies in Congress dismissed the notion that his attacks constituted a threat to Mr. Cohen. “Everyone knows it wasn’t witness intimidation — c’mon,” Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, the top Republican on the Oversight Committee, said in a brief interview. “If he comes, we’ll be ready. If he doesn’t, he doesn’t.”

While neither Cohen nor his lawyer have stated what specific statements they view as threats, [Trump has repeatedly stated that Cohen and his family need further legal scrutiny](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/23/us/politics/michael-cohen-testimony-postponed-congress.html).

> In a recent interview with Jeanine Pirro, the Fox News host and one of Mr. Trump’s preferred interviewers, he called for Mr. Cohen’s father-in-law to be investigated without citing details.

The President also had [this](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1069613383622803456?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1069613383622803456&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vox.com%2F2019%2F1%2F23%2F18194719%2Ftrump-michael-cohen-father-in-law-threat) pair of [Tweets](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1069614615510859776?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1069614615510859776&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vox.com%2F2019%2F1%2F23%2F18194719%2Ftrump-michael-cohen-father-in-law-threat) criticizing Cohen's request at sentencing: 

> “Michael Cohen asks judge for no Prison Time.” You mean he can do all of the TERRIBLE, unrelated to Trump, things having to do with fraud, big loans, Taxis, etc., and not serve a long prison term? He makes up stories to get a GREAT & ALREADY reduced deal for himself, and get...

> ....his wife and father-in-law (who has the money?) off Scott Free. He lied for this outcome and should, in my opinion, serve a full and complete sentence.

The President's lawyer, [Rudy Giuliani, has also participated in pointing towards Cohen's family members](https://www.vox.com/2019/1/23/18194719/trump-michael-cohen-father-in-law-threat):

> In an appearance on CNN Sunday, Rudy Giuliani went even further, stating flat-out that Cohen’s father in law, “a Ukrainian,” “may have ties to something called organized crime.”

> So, Giuliani continued, Cohen was happy to “lie” about Donald Trump in the hope of getting a reduced sentence, because “he’s afraid to testify against his father-in-law, because the repercussions for that will be far worse.”

I have a couple of questions:

1: What is witness tampering?

2: Are Donald Trump's statements towards Cohen examples of witness tampering?
