Recently got a new job, but training has been painfully slow
Hi all, 

I recently got a new job working in production. I had my interview months ago and signed all the necessary contracts and papers to be an employee, but currently I have been waiting around to hear which gigs I can shadow on to train. I want to ask my boss to accelerate this process as I need at least three training days and I've only been on one. I really need this job to pick up quicker than it is, but she said that she'll keep me mind when a suitable shadow day comes through. 

&#x200B;

Does anyone have any advice about how to approach this without coming off as rude? I am really at a loss as to how even word the text. 

&#x200B;

I'd want to say something like, "Hey \_\_\_, I know that you are looking for appropriate days for me to train, but I really need to start working in the coming weeks. Is there anyway to put me on the schedule next week for training, so I can start as soon as possible? Thanks"

Suggestions are appreciated.
