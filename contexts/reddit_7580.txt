If you dropped out of your grad program or left academia: why?
I’m genuinely curious. As I get further into my own grad school experience, I am starting to see/experience a lot of the hypocrisy, politics, bias, and general crappiness of academia that many people have talked about, but I had never experienced before (and kind of naively believed it wouldn’t happen to me or my lab). 

So to those who dropped out of their programs or left academia all together: what drove you to make that decision?
