LOUISE: Thelma.
THELMA: Yeah.
LOUISE: I want you to call Darryl.
THELMA: What for?
LOUISE: To find out if he knows anything. If you think he does, you gotta hang up because it means the police have told him and the phone is probably tapped.
THELMA: Jeez, Louise, tapped the phone? You think so?
LOUISE: Oh, come on! Murder one and armed robbery, Thelma!
THELMA: Murder one! God, Louise, can't we even say it was self-defense?
LOUISE: But it wasn't! We got away! We were walkin' away!
THELMA: They don't know that! It was just you and me there. I'll say he raped me and you had to shoot him! I mean, it's almost the truth!
LOUISE: It won't work.
THELMA: Why not?!
LOUISE: No physical evidence. We can't prove he did it. We probably can't even prove he touched you by now.
