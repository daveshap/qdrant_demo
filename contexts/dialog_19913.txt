WILLIAM: How are you doing?
ANNA: How do you think I'm doing?
WILLIAM: I don't know what happened.
ANNA: I do. Your furry friend thought he'd make a buck or two telling the papers where I was.
WILLIAM: That's not true.
ANNA: Really? The entire British press just woke up this morning and thought 'Hey -- I know where Anna Scott is. She's in that house with the blue door in Notting Hill.' And then you go out in your goddamn underwear.
SPIKE: I went out in my goddamn underwear too.
WILLIAM: Get out, Spike. I'm so sorry.
ANNA: This is such a mess. I come to you to protect myself against more crappy gossip and now I'm landed in it all over again. For God's sake, I've got a boyfriend.
WILLIAM: You do?
ANNA: As far as they're concerned I do. And now tomorrow there'll be pictures of you in every newspapers from here to Timbuktu.
WILLIAM: I know, I know -- but... just -- let's stay calm...
ANNA: You can stay calm -- it's the perfect situation for you -- minimum input, maximum publicity. Everyone you ever bump into will know. 'Well done you -- you slept with that actress -- we've seen the pictures.'
WILLIAM: That's spectacularly unfair.
ANNA: Who knows, it may even help business. Buy a boring book about Egypt from the guy who screwed Anna Scott.
WILLIAM: Now stop. Stop. I beg you -- calm down. Have a cup of tea.
ANNA: I don't want a goddamn cup of tea. I want to go home.
