23m and a 16F?
Not me but my friend is 16years old and a junior in high school.  This guy is 23, a sophomore in college and is about to start at our high school; not teaching but he will have contact with students.  At first they were just “talking” but now I know they’re having sex. I want to do something, because I feel as though he’s preying on her but should I even get in the middle of it? She’s ok with it but he has a tendency to go after younger girls and with him coming to my school I don’t want him to prey on other young girls...WWYD
