STUART: Whoa - give me a chance!
HANA: Sorry. I took a Benzedrine.
STUART: I've got a surprise. A boat! We can go to Capri. It's got a cabin, it's private.
HANA: I'd like to spend a night with you in a bed.
STUART: We can do that when we're very, very old.
CARAVAGGIO: Buon' Giorno! Hana turns, startled and suspicious.
CARAVAGGIO: Are you Hana?
HANA: What do you want?
CARAVAGGIO: I met your friend Mary. She said I should stop and see if you were okay. Apparently we're neighbors - my house is two blocks from yours in Montreal. Cabot, north of Laurier. Bonjour.
HANA: Bonjour.
