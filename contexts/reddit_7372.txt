Has anyone been a mega-commuter? (90+ min each way)
If so, how was your experience, and how is your commute now?

**My story:**

I've been mega-commuting for three years. Two hours each way, on a small, jerky company shuttle (I experience some degree of motion sickness 95% of the time). I live in a major city, and my job is located 50 miles away.

The reason I do this is because I love living in the city. The people I care about live here (girlfriend, family, friends). I rent my own nice place for a great price. I explore the city a lot. And, I don't need a car and don't own one; I can use public transit or use a Zipcar if I need to get around. I've driven to work in the past, and I just can't endure the gridlock for 75-90 min each way.

I've been doing this 4-hour commute for so long and am somewhat used to it. I work with a wonderful team that I'm in sync with, and the company provides great compensation and benefits.

However...after taking time off recently for the holidays and only having to commute from my bed to the kitchenâ€”Jesus, it finally dawned on me how devastating my commute has been. I finally realize, and feel, the years of cumulative strain on my psychological and physical well-being. I've endured the discomfort, telling myself that I'm just paying my dues; after three years, I'm certain it's time to move on and find a job that'll only take me a 30-min bus ride.

Anyway, would love to hear all of your experiences. Thanks.
