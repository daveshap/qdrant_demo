LORI: What are you doing?
QUAID: Some men just tried to kill me!
LORI: Muggers?! Doug, are you all right? What happened?
QUAID: No! Spies or something. And Harry from work...Get down!
QUAID: Harry from work...He was the boss.
LORI: Take it easy. Tell me exactly what happened? Why would spies" want to kill you?"
QUAID: I don't know! It had something to do with Mars.
LORI: Mars? You've never even been to Mars.
QUAID: I know it sounds crazy, but I went to this Rekall place after work, and...
LORI: You went to those brain butchers?!
QUAID: Let me finish!
LORI: What did they do to you? Tell me!
QUAID: --I got a trip to Mars.
LORI: Oh God, Doug.
QUAID: Forget Rekall, will you! These men were going to kill me...
LORI: Doug, nobody tried to kill you.
QUAID: They did! But I killed them!
