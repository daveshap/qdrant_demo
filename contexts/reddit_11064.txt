My lil brother just saved me
I was playing piano in my room, when my mom said to come to her. I turned the piano off (I have a digital one) and walked to the kithen. Then my mom told me that it took me to long to get from my room to the kithen and she thought that i was "on my phone again". She wanted to take away my phone, when my brother (who heard everything) walked in and said "Mom, he was playing piano right now. He didint even touched the phone." And my mom belived him. 

God... I love my brother...
