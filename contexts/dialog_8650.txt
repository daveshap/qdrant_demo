PATRICK: Yeah?
STAN: Just wanted to let you know.
PATRICK: I like Mary. I like when she comes to visit. I just don't think she likes me.
STAN: She likes you okay.
PATRICK: I wonder if I should invite my girlfriend over, too. I have a girlfriend now.
STAN: You can if you want.
PATRICK: Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend?
STAN: This one's history. Moving on...
PATRICK: The thing is... my situation is a little weird. My girlfriend situation.
STAN: Patrick, we need to focus.
CLEMENTINE: Yo ho ho!
JOEL: It's three.
VOICE-OVER: Shit. The last time I saw you.
CLEMENTINE: Anyhoo, sweetie, I done a bad thing. I kinda sorta wrecked your car...
JOEL: I can't believe you wrecked my car. You're driving drunk. It's pathetic.
CLEMENTINE: ...a little. I was a little tipsy. Don't call me pathetic.
JOEL: Well it is pathetic. And fucking irresponsible. You could've killed somebody.
JOEL: I don't know, maybe you did kill somebody.
CLEMENTINE: Oh Christ I didn't kill anybody. It's just a fucking dent. You're like some old lady or something.
VOICE-OVER: Right! She called me an old lady here, too! And I remember, I said...
JOEL: And what are you like? A wino?
CLEMENTINE: A wino? Jesus, Are you from the fifties? A wino! Face it, Joel. You're freaked out because I was out late without you, and in your little wormy brain, you're trying to figure out, did she fuck someone tonight?
JOEL: No, see, Clem, I assume you fucked someone tonight. Isn't that how you get people to like you?
