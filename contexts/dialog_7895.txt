TOR: No. She tink Lobo is waste of my time. Lobo don't talk.
ED: But Tor, it's a starring part! You're second billed.
TOR: Bela, he talk. Loretta, she talk. But Tor, he no talk.
ED: Tor, dialogue is overrated. You look at the classic film actors, who are they? Fairbanks. Chaplin. They didn't talk! They did it all with their face.
TOR: But Greta say --
LORETTA: Eddie, which dress do you like better?

CAMERAMAN BILL: I mean I can't see the difference. I'm color-blind. But I like the dark gray one.
