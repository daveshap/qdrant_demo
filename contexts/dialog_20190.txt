KATE: Sociologist. And because. Pawn shops are just like prostitutes, farm auctions and coal miners. They're all for sale, but none of 'em would be if they weren't desperate for the money.
LARRY: We're all desperate for the money, doll. That's what made this country great. Back me up on this Candy, am I right?
KATE: Don't call me doll, Larry. I hate it when you call me doll.
LARRY: You used to love it when I called you doll.
KATE: You said it differently then.
