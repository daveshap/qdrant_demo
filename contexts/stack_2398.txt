Keeping inventory conditionally I want to make a PvP data pack for a Minecraft server, and I want it to function as follows: if a player is killed within half a minute of him hitting another player, they should drop all their items, but if they're killed without hitting another player they should keep their inventory. Is this possible? Also, if possible, I would want to do this without using command blocks.
