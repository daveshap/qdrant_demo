DOROTHY: I've got a 24 hour a day reminder of Roger, for the rest of my life. I have had three lovers in four years, all boring, all achingly self-sufficient all friends of yours I might add, and all of them running a distant second to a warm bath. Look at me, Laurel, look at me. I'm the oldest 26 year old in the world! How do I look?
LAUREL: Good.
DOROTHY: Thanks.
RAY: And then my dad died and my mom took me to the zoo and I love the zoo. Do you hate the zoo or do you love the zoo?
JERRY: Wait. I want to tell you more about my dad.
RAY: Let's go the zoo.
JERRY: Okay. I've been hogging it. You're right. _ 76.
RAY: Let's go right now. Let's go to the zoo.
JERRY: Aw, the fucking thing... I mean, the zoo is closed.
RAY: You said fuck"."
JERRY: Yeah I know. I did.
RAY: I won't tell.
JERRY: We'll go to the zoo sometime. Okay? I think I might have some time on my hands.
RAY: I don't see any.
JERRY: Funny.
RAY: Funny... I better go to bed.
DOROTHY: Drinks. Food. Plus, I called you a cab.
JERRY: Good idea. Thank you.
