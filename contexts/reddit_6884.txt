My company is downsizing and I am being retained. What questions do I need to ask my employers?
I work for a small non-profit. We recently discovered that a portion of what we do will be getting outsourced. The company is still in negotiations, so there are still many things that my employer cannot disclose to me.

I have been told that my job is safe and will likely evolve, maybe into a leadership position. I am not sure about my direct reports yet. Both my boss and the CFO have assured me that I am essential and absolutely needed for the transition and beyond. While I believe they are straight-shooters, I also understand that they will also have the company’s best interests in heart.

This is my first real job and not really sure what people do in situations like these. What questions should I be asking my employers? Do I need to get other guarantees in place before agreeing to stay? I was hired as an “at will” employee so my job.

Thank you.
