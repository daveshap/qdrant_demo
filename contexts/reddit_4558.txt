DAE feel like they don’t really want the future anymore?
I had a conversation with my brother recently and he was talking about how i’m going to be applying for top universities and how I could get business scholarships to help pay for it and secure a job placement if i’m one of the top performers which I could be, and how I need to consider the amount of debt i’ll be in from it when I get married, buy a house, get a car, have kids etcetera. I just... don’t feel optimistic about my prospects anymore. I don’t even care about the debt, I can’t see myself ever buying a house and I can’t even bring myself to imagine having a s/o and kid’s. All I want to do is go to bed and not move from under the covers... I don’t know when this even happened. I was at the top of my school for exams, got accepted into one of the best colleges in my country, and i’m studying hard to get good grades in my subjects as well as maintaining extracurriculars. Everything i’m doing points towards having a successful future but I don’t think I really care anymore.
