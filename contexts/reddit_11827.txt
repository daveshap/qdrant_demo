Facebook makes me feel lonely, but leaving it would only make me lonelier.
Social media has been getting me really down.  

First off, I should say that I'm naturally a social guy.  Despite some social anxieties I've struggled with over the years, I've never really had a problem getting to know people or "putting myself out there," so to speak.  

Now, I have a lot of friends on Facebook and a lot of them "like" and comment on the statuses and content I post (lately, I've been averaging something like 30-40 "likes" per status / picture / whatever else have you).  Sometimes in person, they tell me how funny or thought-provoking my posts are.  And yeah, that's great I guess.  It's like I'm "high-school popular" or something.  

But lately, I've been feeling lonely about it all. It's like my social life is being boiled down to how many people like or comment on the things I put out on the internet, and I feel like my friends aren't really listening or even care that much at all.  It makes me feel like a bit of a toy.  On top of that, it seems I have to keep producing these posts in order to have my feelings noticed and stay relevant.  And that makes me feel exhausted and, more troublingly, empty.  

So,  I've thought about breaking from social media entirely, if only to become more in touch with myself, my family, and the people who are dear to me.  The problem is that I've done this before-- I left Facebook for a 9- month stretch during a post-breakup depression-- and it's never quite fared well in my favor: since all of my friends are on Facebook, all of them--even the close friends--primarily communicate, plan events, etc. through Facebook so naturally, I missed out on a lot of real-life social happenings.  

**tl;dr I feel caught in this Catch-22:  either I stay obsessively stuck to Facebook to be noticed but feel empty about it, or break with it entirely but feel lonely about it.**  

So, that's me.  That's what's on my mind.
