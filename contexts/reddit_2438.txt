What if I legitimately don’t have any passions?
I’ve been in this life decision limbo for years. 

I understand my job does not have to directly be my passion, just something that allows me to pursue that passion. But what if I truly don’t have one thing in life that I see myself doing for the rest of my life? 

I just graduated and while I have little hobbies of yoga, hanging with my dog and friends, shopping,  and smoking weed-I don’t know if any of that defines me. They’re also pretty basic and generic to try and mold your life around. I mean I know yoga can be a big part of life, but I think for me it’s just a way to relieve stress and pain. I think my lack of passion is proved by the fact that I have absolutely nothing enjoyable to do with all this free unemployed time while away from friends. I hate it. 

My one and only dream has been to have my own beautifully decorated studio apartment in the city with my dog. And one day far away, a mom. I literally just want to be independent. It’s hard to get there without any understanding of who you want to be. Maybe it’s because I have depression, but I’m not actually sad right now, just lost.

EDIT: thank you all for these responses. I’ve been trying to take pauses in between my day and read them all. I will keep trying to reply the next day or two because I’m learning with each response!

I understand I don’t have to have a true passion. I just want to figure out what I can literally just TOLERATE. I KNOW I find passion in anything I feel adequate in, that will reward in itself. I just don’t feel good at anything but I know it’s not true.
