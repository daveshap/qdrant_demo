ELAINE: You got a telegram from headÂ­quarters today.
STRIKER: Headquarters!? What is it?
ELAINE: It's a big building where the generals meet. But that's not important right now. They've cleared you of any blame for what happened on that raid. Isn't that good news?
STRIKER: Is it? Because of my mistake six men didn't return from that raid.
ELAINE: Seven. Lieutenant Zipp died this morning. Ted, Doctor Sandler says you'll be out in a week. Isn't that wonderful?
STRIKER: I wish I could say the same for George Zipp.
ELAINE: Be patient, Ted. No one expects you to get over this immediately.
