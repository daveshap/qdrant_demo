How Has Trumps Presidency Affected The Stock Market, And How Does The Recent Stock Market Drop Compare To Market Activity Under Past Presidencies?
[The DOW dropped by 1,175 points today](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/02/05/583325123/stocks-extend-losses-with-dow-dropping-more-than-300-points-at-the-open)- the largest numeric drop in history. However, [this was only 4.6%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_daily_changes_in_the_Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average) of the market, which is significantly smaller than other historic drops, the past five of which averaged around 7%. 

Most of the other large drops can be attributed to the Recession of 2008, which occurred at the end of Bush's presidency. Two notable outliers were a 5% drop in 2011, and a 7% drop in 1997. 

Politifact published [an analysis indicating that the Stock Market performs better under Democratic Presidents](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2018/jan/08/how-trump-obama-compare-stock-market/), however, the DOW has grown about 35%(see link above) during Trumps presidency so far. 

How do presidencies and their policies affect the stock market(if at all) and how is the current market under Trump comparing to past presidencies?
