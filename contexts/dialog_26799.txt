STEVE: Then why did you conduct at one of their Nuremberg rallies?
FURTWÄNGLER: I did not conduct at at the rally, I conducted on the evening before the rally.
STEVE: That sounds like the small print in one of our insurance policies, Wilhelm. And what about April 19, 1942? The eve of Hitler's fifty- third birthday, the big celebration; you conducted for Hitler, didn't you? Was that in keeping with your view that art and politics have nothing to do with each other?
FURTWÄNGLER: That... that was a different matter, I... I was tricked.
STEVE: How come?
FURTWÄNGLER: Could I have a glass of water, please? Please, Fraulein?
