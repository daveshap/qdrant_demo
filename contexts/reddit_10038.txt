Grad Students (Para-Professionals) in Student Affairs Programs
I'm wondering about a few things regarding Graduate Students that work in your departments: (Particularly Res-Life, but in general as well)

1) How well did your department implement their positions?
2) What office dynamics accompanied the introduction of these students?
