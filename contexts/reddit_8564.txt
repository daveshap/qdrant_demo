What are the reason for and against repealing Obama's Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces Executive Order?
President Obama signed the [Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces EO in 2014](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2014/07/31/executive-order-fair-pay-and-safe-workplaces) and President Trump has rescinded it. To summarize, the EO made companies disclose federal labor violations when bidding on federal contracts worth over $500,000. Sean Spicer commented that ["The rule simply made it too easy for trial lawyers to go after American companies and American workers who contract with the federal government"](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/03/27/press-briefing-press-secretary-sean-spicer-3272017-29). Critics were very harsh on this EO saying that it is ["impossible to comply with" and would "significantly disrupt procurements and impose significant costs and burderns on the contracting community"](http://hr.blr.com/HR-news/Discrimination/Government-Contractors/Fair-Pay-Safe-Workplaces-heavy-criticism/). Supporters lambasted Trump's decision, citing failures of government contractors to follow federal law: [19% of federal-employed contractors had over 1000 wage violations](https://www.warren.senate.gov/files/documents/2017-3-6_Warren_Contractor_Report.pdf) over the past three years. Additionally, 66% of federally employed contractors had more than 1 wage violation in the past 3 years. 

My questions are:

1) Do the cons of this EO outweigh the pros? (obviously this administration thinks so, what does NP think?)

2) Is there a way to institute this regulation to protect workers while also not putting unjust burden on companies?
