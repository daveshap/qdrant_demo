Example of stable non minimum phase system with negative gain or phase margin I read in a particular book that the fact that gain margin and phase margin are positive implies stability is only true for minimum phase systems. But, for non-minimum phase systems, system can be stable even with negative gain and phase marginsCan you please given an example of a non-minimum phase system, which is stable but has a negative gain margin or phase margin
