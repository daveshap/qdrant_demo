SANDY: Stop it Mike.
MIKE: You shut up. Nobody's talkin' to you. Hey who's that Jeffrey? Your mother?
JEFFREY: Dorothy!... Dorothy!
SANDY: Dorothy Vallens?
JEFFREY: Yes.
MIKE: Hey, you ivy league shit. COME HERE!
JEFFREY: Later Mike. I gotta take care of someone who's hurt here, in case you haven't noticed.
