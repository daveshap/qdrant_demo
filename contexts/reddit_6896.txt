Help understanding my new position
I'm a tradesman, and I just came back from trade school. On my first day back, on my way to a site, my boss told me that winter will be slow and he cant really bring me back full time, I'd have to remain on EI from trade school and work one shift a week to top up. When it gets busier in spring, he'd bring me back.

I didn't really know what to think of this. I thought he was straight up laying me off at first but I couldn't imagine why, I'm a pretty decent employee and we've had no issues so I don't know why he's lay me off for real. My second assumption is that, and this is true, we really are slow this time and he can't afford me at the moment but he doesn't want to lose me. He thinks this is a totally acceptable offer and that I'm just supposed to hang around all winter until it picks up? I told him I'd have to look elsewhere likely and he said that if I had to, then I have to and he's understand. He said if I came back in spring I'd have a raise and guaranteed hours.



What does this sound like to you guys? ANy clarification ask me, I'm around all day.
