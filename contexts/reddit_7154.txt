Job hunting while running a start-up company
I'm a recent engineering graduate whose looking for a job.  Problem is, I (along with a couple of co-founders) founded a start-up company a year back.  Because the co-founders already have full-time jobs and are working on the start-up company on the side, they would like to avoid investor funding (and paying themselves and me) as long as possible to avoid dilution.

Here's my situation: I'm broke and need a source of income (aka a full-time job).  However, working on the start-up company drains all of my energy and time and stresses me out significantly, making it really difficult to make any significant progress in the job hunt.

Should I just quit the start-up now and dedicate my time fully on the job hunt?
