TREVES: Why, my dear Mrs. Mothershead, how good of you to join us. Mr. Merrick, will you please introduce yourself?
MERRICK: Hello, my name is John Merrick.
MOTHERSHEAD: Good Lord, Mr. Treves!
TREVES: We've made tremendous strides today, Mothershead. He listens and repeats with great attention, and this certainly isn't easy for him.
MOTHERSHEAD: Parrots can do as much, Mr. Treves. It's all very nice, but I don't see the point. You know they won't let him stay here.
TREVES: I'm sure that if Mr. Merrick made a good impression on the hospital committee they'd see that he's the exception to their rule. Now I'm not expecting miracles. I'm not saying he'll be able to read or write, but I do think that I can get him to speak for himself. I'm going to arrange things with Carr Gomm right now. That was very good, John, very good. That's all for today. We shall do some more tomorrow. Mothershead?
