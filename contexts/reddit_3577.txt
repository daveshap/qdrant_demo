Am I the only girl who doesn’t like tall guys?
As someone who is 5’2”, I find guys over 6’ unattractive. It’s hard to kiss them, you can’t talk to them without looking up their nose, it’s just an uncomfortable situation. It seems like in my girl friend group, I am the only one who feels this way. There’s gotta be girls out there who want a nice, practical 5’9” or 5’8” right?!?

Edit: Also applies to guys shorter than 5’8”, was just trying to have a dramatic compromise for others. My personal preference is 5’4”-5’7”.
