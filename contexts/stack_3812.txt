3-way ANOVA with a significant 2-way interaction. What are my next steps? I have performed a mixed 3 way ANOVA: Group (2 levels) x Factor2 (2 levels) x Factor3 (2 levels).There was no significant 3-way interaction; however, there was a significant 2-way interaction between Group and Factor2.I am confused by the difference between \"main effects\" and \"simple main effects,\" and I am not sure what step to take next to understand the 2-way interaction.Do I need to perform a 2-way ANOVA (Group x Factor2)? Do I need to perform 4 separate tests of some kind?[UPDATE]Here is the procedure I used to run the simple main effects:There was no significant 3 way interaction however there was a significant 2 way interaction of Group*Factor1 and a significant main effect of Factor1.1) Ran through the same menu option as to explore the 3 way and 2 way interactions.  SPSS -> Analyze -> GLM -> Repeated Measures.2) Clicked 'Paste' in the repeated measures window and adjusted the syntax as follows:GLM AccF1_L1 Acc_F1_L2 Acc_F2_L1 AccF2_L2 BY Group  /WSFACTOR=Factor1 2 Polynomial Factor2 2 Polynomial   /EMMEANS=TABLES(Factor1*Group) COMPARE(Group).3) Interpret 'Univariate Tests'4) If any significant simple main effects go on to interpret pairwise comparisons.
