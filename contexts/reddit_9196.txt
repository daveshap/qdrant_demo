Holy shit, today is the day.
It's finally here, the day I've been working towards!  It still doesn't feel real.

As of 9 am today, I am OFFICIALLY 100% DEBT FREE. I owe no money anywhere, to anyone. I go forth as a free man. I can't tell you how good this feels.  This is new air to breathe.

Stay the course, it can be done.  Don't give up, whatever you do.  

Thank you, that is all.
