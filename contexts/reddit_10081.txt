Entering Job Market Advice
Hey everyone! Just for some background, I'm a senior at a UC graduating in mid-June with a double major in neurobiology and music, and I was hoping to get some advice regarding attaining a position in academic advising.


This past school year, I've been working for our music department as a peer advisor. Since I pursued a double major and experienced a somewhat less conventional and more hectic college curriculum pathway, I've advised a lot of students with primary fields of study within and outside of the department. Through training for the position alone, I gained familiarity with the typical advising approaches the university advisors use and those endorsed by NACADA, e.g. holistic, appreciative, narrative, etc., and I'm also about to finish an Academic Peer Advising Certificate program offered by the school's advising center. I've consistently held student leadership positions since my sophomore year and have a lot of experience with student outreach for individuals of diverse backgrounds.


Are there any specific things I should be doing when I apply for entry-level academic advisor positions, and if I'm graduating in June, when's a good time to seriously start applying? During interviews, I plan on highlighting specific experiences employing certain advising techniques and my ability to work with diverse student populations and understand the present-day issues they face.


Also, how good/bad are my chances of landing a job in California specifically, given that I don't possess a master's? I'm aware that it would make me more qualified, but if possible, I would rather go into the industry after college and complete a master's part-time a few years down the road once I'm more financially settled.


Thank you so much in advance!
