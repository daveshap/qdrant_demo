WANDA: Commander, what are you doing here?
CASTOR: Where should I be? Where's everyone else?
WANDA: Backing you up! Didn't you track Castor to the Army Street Terminal?
CASTOR: What?
WANDA: It was confirmed by your personal security code. Nobody knows that code but you!
CASTOR: Obviously someone else knows it! Get everybody back to their posts -- NOW!
