Quit without notice yesterday, what do I tell recruiter i'm meeting with tomorrow?
Yesterday I quit my job without notice. It was an extremely nasty work environment that I'd been actively looking to leave for months with middling success (several interviews and even one opportunity that made it to salary negotiations before falling through), and I finally hit my limit. I didn't make a scene or say anything inflammatory, I sent a simple and formal email announcing my immediate resignation on my commute home. I immediately started sending out my resume, and I received a call today from a recruiting agency that works in my field, and we have a meeting tomorrow to discuss possible roles. 

How should I discuss quitting without notice, and the reasons for leaving my job? I know I shouldn't talk ill of my employer in regular interviews, but I have heard that being straightforward with recruiters is better than trying to cover up what could be seen by potential new employers as a red flag.
