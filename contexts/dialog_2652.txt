DELACROIX: Nice to meet you. If you don't mind me asking you - how old are you?
JUKKA: I just turned twenty.
DUNWITTY: I'm gonna leave you two creative geniuses alone.
DELACROIX: Dunwitty, don't leave.
DELACROIX: Where are you from?
JUKKA: Helsinki, which is the capital of Finland.
DELACROIX: Finland.
JUKKA: You know, Finlandia vodka? Yes?
DELACROIX: Yes, I know. Jukka, have you ever seen a Negro person before? Even had a real conversation with a real Negro before?
JUKKA: What's a Negro.
DELACROIX: A fiasco. A disaster. A boondoggle. An abomination.
DELACROIX: Did you just ask me what's a Negro? I'M A NEGRO!!!
JUKKA: Ahhh!!! I never heard of that term before. I thought you were BLACK of African-American. No?
DELACROIX: Well before there was BLACK or AFRICAN AMERICAN, there were NEGROES. I'M A NEGRO.
JUKKA: Thank you for correcting my ignorance. I'm looking forward to working side by side with you. I feel we make a good team.
DELACROIX: How did you get this gig?
JUKKA: My visual style is very erotic, sexy, how do you say - hot?
DELACROIX: This is a TV show, not a music video.
JUKKA: Then will you teach me what I need to know. Maybe we learn from each other, if that's possible, no?
DELACROIX: This is a travesty. A debacle.
SLOAN: You've said that already.
DELACROIX: I'm gonna slit my wrists. Cut my throat. For the love of Joseph.
