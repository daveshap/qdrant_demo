Asian mom
Tonight my mom called me while I was at dinner with my man (since August) inquiring about my leased vehicle that is due at the end of this month. I told her that I was bringing it to the dealer next week to get evaluated for a potential new lease. I’m a 29F who got into this last lease with my ex fiancé (broke off last June) after trading my fully paid car off for it. The lease fell on me as it was in my name and I have barely been able to afford it on my own. Fast forward back to tonight, she asks me if my new boyfriend will be paying for my new car. 

With a couple glasses of wine in me, sitting at the communal table with my guy I start going into it with my mum a bit heated, asking her if she’s actually serious in mandarin. She proceeds to say she’s joking but I am clearly irked now - she’s constantly pushing her traditional Asian ideals on me (find a man with money to take care of you type of shit). 

I honestly can’t take this bullshit from her anymore and can barely stand being around my family. After ending the call with her I immediately and regretfully spilled the details to my boo and just felt like I brought our mood down - although he continued to still be so supportive of me. I feel like I shouldn’t have reacted so aggressively during the conversation with her but just don’t know how to stabilize my emotions with what she constantly throws at me. In turn I feel so bad for laying this all down on my boyfriend. Venting and seeking consolation. Does anyone go through the same ordeal with Asian moms? Does she honestly just not respect me or does it go beyond that? Obviously there is a lot more background info missing but it just seems to be a constant with her, I feel like I have never gotten the right guidance in order to have healthy relationships. I don’t want to blow it with my new boo and really need to learn how to balance this.
