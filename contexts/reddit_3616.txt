I asked my crush out today AND SHE SAID YES!!!
I still can't believe it happened! I'm 24 years old and this **is the first time I've EVER asked a girl out outside of a dating app**. I made a post on /r/dating_advice last week under an alt account, asking for advice on ***if*** I should be asking this girl out. What if I'm not her type? What if she says no? Will it be awkward? What if I mess up? But then as I was typing the post out I realized that the only way I'd ever get the answer to any of those questions was to *ask her out and find out for myself*. What the fuck was I doing asking strangers on the internet for? 

And so I did it! I was in class with my crush for all of today and I kept looking at her dreaming of finally asking her on a date. I was going to let her slide by as I always do. I came up with my usual excuses. I haven't shaved recently and I look unkempt. I'm not dressed well enough later I'll ask her when I look better. She doesn't know you, become her friend first. She's busy with class right now leave her alone!

But then at the end of class I noticed that she was staying behind to pack up her bag after talking to the professor. She was walking towards the exit and I was too so I held the door for her and just said "Hey!" awkwardly as I let her through. She said some greeting in return and then started to walk down the hall in the opposite direction. 

And then I could just feel something come over me. It was the perfect time. She's all alone! You don't have to embarrass yourself in front of your classmates! It's the perfect opportunity are you going to let her pass you by again!? Do it!!! And so I jogged after her down the hall and called out her name. It was awkward as I've never really spoken to her before! I just introduced myself and asked her if she wanted to grab some coffee later this week? I tripped over my words a bit and it didn't come out the way I always imagined it. My heart was pounding and my legs felt like jelly! Still she said YES!! 

I still can't believe it. The whole thing took like 90 seconds. I've gone through 4 years of college and I've NEVER been brave enough to approach a girl in person. Hell I've only gone on like 3 dates in my entire life! I can't believe that all it really required was about a minute or two of pure courage. 

I'm trying not to get too excited as I don't even know her yet (who knows if we're even compatible with each other) but I'm still hopeful! I wish I had done this years ago, I feel so empowered right now!
