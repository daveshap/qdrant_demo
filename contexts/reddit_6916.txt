Job redundancy in Australia
Hi everyone, I'm a new manager at my workplace and I've been working here for some time now. One of the many things I handle is managing the staff. Unfortunately, we're making some heavy losses at the moment and need to cut back on staff. One option we're looking at is making some lower paying jobs redundant. I've personally never done this before, and Google wasn't of much help. Can someone help explain to me how does one make a job redundant?
