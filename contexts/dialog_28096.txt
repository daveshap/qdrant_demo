JANE: Hello again, neighbour. I didn’t intrude, did I?
LOMBARD: How are you, Jane?
JANE: Fine. How was the match? Did you loose?
LOMBARD: No.
JANE: Must be your lucky day then. I’ve got your accounts - you don’t owe much tax for last year.
LOMBARD: Good.
JANE: Yes. But my boss reckons you’d still be better off as a limited company. For expenses and all that, you know? It’d cost you about £100 but he said it’d be worth it. Of course, you’d need a partner to register. But that’s a formality. I mean, I could be your partner. I mean, just as a name, right?
JANE: Have you heard of a French film called “La Collectionoose”?
LOMBARD: La what?
JANE: “La collectionoose”. It’s about a young girl in the south of France who seduces a different man every night and then meets one who resists her. It’s on TV tonight and as I’m in I thought we could perhaps look at your accounts and... The review says it’s about the conflict between intellect and instinct. And witty. The director’s supposed to be famous. Rommel or something. French. You must know him?
LOMBARD: Should I?
JANE: I don’t know. How many famous French film directors can there be?
LOMBARD: That are called Rommel or something, I guess not that many.
JANE: So you haven’t seen the film, then?
LOMBARD: It’s Friday night, Jane. What happened to your latest boyfriend?
JANE: Oh... We split up.
LOMBARD: Well, I hope you’re not too heartbroken and...
JANE: Oh no. I’m all right. He was a jerk, really. Another boy, you know? All I meet is boys. When I think of all the fuss about older men fancying young girls. I mean, is it true?
