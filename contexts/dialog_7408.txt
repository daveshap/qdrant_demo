HAWK: Thanks, miss.
AMANDA: You're too kind. I'm Amanda.
HAWK: Right, well, thanks for the drinks and stuff, Amanda, but there's no reason for me to stick around these parts anymore.
AMANDA: Don't be so glum, Hawk. The night's still young and filled with plenty of compensatory possibilities.
HAWK: Huh?
AMANDA: I'd be in a position to spend some money on you if you'd get in a position and spend some time on me.
