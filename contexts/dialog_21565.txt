LILA: I just listened... and believed everything they told me. 'She stole the money.' 'We don't want to get her in trouble.' 'No don't bring the police in'...
SAM: It was her boss' idea not to report it to the police?
LILA: No. The man whose money she... he talked so loud and fast, and I... I should've called the police.
SAM: He must have had a darn good reason for wanting them kept out of it... All that cash...
LILA: I ought to call the police right now!
SAM: No.
LILA: Why not? Sam, is she hiding here? Are you two planning to go away with the money?
SAM: How could I go away? I'm in debt up to my... If she did steal that money... It's hard to believe she did because it's hard to see why she would. Unless she had some wild idea that it would help me... us...
LILA: She haven't even called you?
SAM: I didn't see her... and I didn't hear from her! Believe that!
LILA: I need to... I need to believe something. This is the first time I've ever come up against anything I couldn't... understand.
SAM: You've led a charmed life.
LILA: No. I just think... anything can be explained. But Mary, doing a thing like this... I don't know how to handle...
SAM: Maybe we can handle it together.
LILA: I came flying up here expecting to get some explanation... for all I know, she may be trying to get in touch with me, at home. I'd better go home.
SAM: I think she'll contact me if she contacts anybody. Why don't you stay here. When she shows up... or calls... be here.
LILA: You want me to stay here?
SAM: She'll need both of us.
LILA: Where... can I stay?
SAM: First rate hotel, fifty yards up the street. Come on. After we check you in we'll go to the drugstore and get you a sandwich. Then we'll come back here... and wait.
NORMAN: I always forget to put the sign on, but we do have vacancy. Twelve in fact. Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.
ARBOGAST: In the past two days I've been to so many motels, my eyes are bleary with neon. This is the first one that looked like it was hiding from the world at large.
NORMAN: I don't really forget the sign, it just doesn't seem... any use. This used to be the main highway. Want to register, please?
ARBOGAST: Sit down. I don't want to trouble you, just want to ask...
NORMAN: No trouble. Today's linen day. I change all the beds once a week, whether they've been used or not... dampness. I hate the smell of dampness. It's such a dank smell.
NORMAN: You out to buy a motel?
ARBOGAST: No.
NORMAN: Oh. I thought... you said you'd been to so many in two days... What was it you wanted to ask?
ARBOGAST: I'm looking for a missing person. My name's Arbogast, private investigator... Trying to trace a young girl who's been missing almost a week. From Phoenix. It's a private matter... family wants to forgive her... She isn't in trouble.
NORMAN: I didn't think the police went searching for people who weren't in trouble.
ARBOGAST: I'm not the police.
NORMAN: Oh.
ARBOGAST: We have reason to believe she came this way... might have stopped in this area... Did she stop here?
NORMAN: No. No one has stopped here in weeks...
ARBOGAST: Mind looking at the picture before committing yourself?
NORMAN: Committing myself to what? You sure talk like a Policeman.
ARBOGAST: Look at the picture. Please.
NORMAN: No. At least I don't recall.
ARBOGAST: She might have used an alias. Mary Crane's the real name, but she might've registered...
NORMAN: I don't even bother with guests registering any more... I mean, little by little, you drop the formalities. I shouldn't even bother to change the linen. I guess habits die hard. Which reminds me...
