BUTTERFIELD: Ever watched a man die? If you watch very closely, you can sometimes see the soul escaping. And if you're very quick, you can catch it.
QUAID: Please... Butterfield... I wasn't there. Ask Pimm.
BUTTERFIELD: Pimm's dead. Jennifer Desiderio's disappeared. They knew the Puritan was coming home.
BUTTERFIELD: So do you. You've seen the future. Haven't you?
QUAID: Yes.
BUTTERFIELD: And are you afraid?
QUAID: Yes.
