He won’t leave me alone and i’m scared
hello !! i’m very very new to reddit ( today ) so idk if i’m doing this right, but i just needed a place to ask for advice about something i can’t talk about irl 

so basically this guy i met from a summer camp will NOT leave me alone.  He’s 6’4 and prolly 300 pounds, i am NOT 6’4 and 300 pounds. He sends me constant unwanted pics and tries to make me send them in return. saying things like “ i’ll give u a deal, u either send me 5 pics and we don’t hook up when we see each other or u send me one and we do” or “i know u want to, just let me take care of u”.  i would block him but he has shown up to my house before without me telling him my address so i know he can find me. we also have mutual friends and i don’t want them to find out about all this. i’ve told him i’m not interested multiple times and when he gets into his moods i just won’t answer him, but he just sends 50 pics and it’s rlly starting to make me scared. 

the day he showed up to my house , he was with another one of my friends and as creeped out as i was , i couldn’t just close the door in their faces so i went out w them. my friend had to go to work so she left, leaving me and this guy alone in his car. i asked to go home and he drove me in complete silence ( SCARIEST 30 MINS OF MY LIFE )  after he dropped me off , he texted me and said “ the whole car ride i could only think of pulling over and making u blow me “ 
I’m really starting to get scared and i need advice on how to get him to leave me alone. 
sorry for the length !!
