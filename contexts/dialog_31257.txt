RACHEL: Your sister said you don't have a family?
BOOK: No.
RACHEL: She thinks you should get married and have children of your own. Instead of trying to be a father to hers. Except she thinks you're afraid of the responsibility.
BOOK: Oh? Anything else?
RACHEL: Oh yes. She thinks you like policing because you think you're right about everything. And you're the only one who can do anything. And that when you drink a lot of beer you say things like none of the other police would know a crook from a... um... bag of elbows.
