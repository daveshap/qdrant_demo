Is the dissertation process outdated?
As the title suggests is it outdated? On my way into school today, I was thinking about how tedious the dissertation process can be. Now, I have a few publications, I say this because of two reasons; a) you write it in a journal esque manner but provide extra details and b) students are told to try and publish their dissertation in which they will trim the fat anyways. 

If someone isn't a published researcher, I do see the value. However, given the current state of graduate school, it seems that getting publications force the dissertation to be a formality rather then a "learning experience". 

Thoughts?
