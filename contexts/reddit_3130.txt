Should I leave my first ever job at a great company after 14 months for a senior position at a startup with awesome benefits?
After graduating college, I got super lucky and landed a job at a very good tech company as a technical consultant. As happy as I am here, career progression is very important to me and the red tape of a large company bothers me. Of the college hires that I started with I feel that I’m one of the best performers, so I have been asking for more responsibility and work to pursue a promotion. However, it just doesn’t seem like I’m getting the opportunities I want and there’s no clear timeline for a promotion. 

I haven’t been looking for a new job but decided to try out interviewing when contacted. To my surprise I actually have an offer from a late stage startup that seems to be doing very well. It would be roughly a 15k raise with equal if not better benefits in a senior role.  

Should I entertain this offer to leave a well established  company for a startup so early in my career and only 14 months into my first real job? Should I stay where I am to have 2 solid years under my belt? Or really what kind of due diligence should I do before deciding one way or another.
