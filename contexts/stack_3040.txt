Why doesn't optical path difference occur when light from two coherent sources pass through a lens? I guess, for a convex lens I might say that the marginal rays travel a longer path but spend a shorter time inside the lens, while the opposite of that happens in case of paraxial rays. That can be an explanation for the same optical path, but what about a concave lens? For a concave lens, the marginal rays actually travel a longer path and also spend more time inside the lens. I might be wrong in my conjecture, and even if I'm right, I'd like a quantitative explanation.
