KAT: Tell me something true.
PATRICK: I hate peas.
KAT: No -- something real. Something no one else knows.
PATRICK: You're sweet. And sexy. And completely hot for me.
KAT: What?
PATRICK: No one else knows
KAT: You're amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that?
PATRICK: Go to the prom with me
KAT: Is that a request or a command?
PATRICK: You know what I mean
KAT: No.
PATRICK: No what?
KAT: No, I won't go with you
PATRICK: Why not?
KAT: Because I don't want to. It's a stupid tradition.
