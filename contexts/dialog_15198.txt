BRIAN: So what do you do Early?
EARLY: Oh... I do some work up at the Merrick Mirror factory, or I used to...
ADELE: One night we figured out how much bad luck he must have comin' from all them mirrors he broke... Four hundred and ninety four years to work it all off... After he dies, he'll have to keep coming back to earth over and over and over...
CARRIE: Karma.
ADELE: What?
CARRIE: Karma... You know, if you do something bad to somebody fate will pay you back by something bad happening to you.
ADELE: That French ain't it?
