Sleeping is so peaceful, I hate waking up.
When I am sleeping, nothing around me exists. No duties, no burdens, no depression nothing. I can just live. Even dreamless sleeps, where there is nothing but darkness feels so comfortable. I can just close my eyes and leave this world for some moments. 

I am so tired. So tired of everything. They always say "there's light at the end of the tunnel" but I've been running and running with no end in sight. No relief in sight. I'm just endlessly running while wearing a mask of a sane man.
