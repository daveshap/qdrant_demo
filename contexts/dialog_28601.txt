THE PRESIDENT: No choice. This is going to cost lives any way we go. Do nothing, and it could be 80 million of ours. We have to get rid of those missiles.
KENNY: There've got to be alternatives to just going out and bombing them.
BOBBY: He's right, Jack. Taylor is saying we may have some time. We've got to use it.
THE PRESIDENT: So if there are alternatives that make sense -- and I'm not saying there are -- we need 'em. Need 'em fast.
BOBBY: What about the allies? Congress? I think we may need to start letting key people know. And they're all scattered across the country for the campaign. We're going to need to get the U.N. staff in and warmed up. Jesus... I don't even know if we've got secure communications with half our embassies since that the Soviets got that cryptographer of ours.
THE PRESIDENT: We can't worry about everything right now. We've got to figure out what we're going to do before we worry about how we do it.
KENNY: The other thing is...
BOBBY: ...I know. CIA and the military fucked us on the Bay of Pigs.
KENNY: They're going to be pressing for a military solution soon. We can't afford to let them ram their agenda down our throats. We need to come with options other than air strikes so we have some sort of choice here.
BOBBY: We got a bunch of smart guys. We lock 'em up together in there, kick 'em in the ass til they come up with options.
BOBBY: I'll do it.
KENNY: It's too politicized with you in there, anyway. They need to be able to stick their necks out.
BOBBY: It'll be the principals, a couple of the key guys from each department: the Executive Committee of the National Security Council. We'll call it EXCOM.
