AUGGIE: So you're just going to give up and go home?
RUBY: I don't have much choice, do I? It's pretty clear she doesn't want me around.
AUGGIE: Still, you can't just write her off.
RUBY: Yeah? And what else am I supposed to do? There's no baby anymore, and if she wants to throw away her life, that's her business.
AUGGIE: She's just a kid. There's time for more babies later. After she grows up.
RUBY: Dream on, Auggie. She'll be lucky to make it to her nineteenth birthday.
AUGGIE: Not if you got her into one of those rehab programs.
RUBY: I'd never be able to talk her into it. And even if I could, those things cost money. And that's just what I don't have. I'm flat out dead broke.
AUGGIE: No you're not.
RUBY: Are you calling me a liar? I'm telling you I'm broke. I don't even have insurance on my goddamned car.
AUGGIE: Remember that business venture I was telling you about? Well, my tugboat came in. I'm flush.
RUBY: Bully for you.
AUGGIE: No, bully for you.
RUBY: What's this?
AUGGIE: Why don't you open it and find out?
RUBY: Jesus God, Auggie. There's money in here.
AUGGIE: Five thousand bucks.
RUBY: And you're giving it to me?
AUGGIE: It's all yours, baby.
RUBY: For keeps?
AUGGIE: For keeps.
RUBY: I can't believe it. Oh God, I can't believe it. You're an angel, Auggie. An angel from heaven.
AUGGIE: Fuck this angel shit. Just take the dough, Ruby. But no bawling, okay? I can't stand people who blubber.
RUBY: I'm sorry, baby. I can't help it.
AUGGIE: There's just one thing I want to know.
RUBY: Anything, Auggie. Just name it.
