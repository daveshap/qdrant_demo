CAPT. BARNEY: What am I going to to do with this guy? Pierce, I was just on the phone with Borough Command. Out of twelve shifts this month, you've been late for nine, sick four and that includes the shift where you came late and went home early.
FRANK: I'm sick. That's what I've been telling you.
CAPT. BARNEY: You're killing me, you know that? You got no sick time according to Command. I've been told to terminate.
FRANK: It's okay. I'll just get my things out of the locker.
CAPT. BARNEY: I've never fired anyone in my life.
FRANK: I'm sorry Captain. Don't take it too hard.
CAPT. BARNEY: Nobody tells me to fire anyone. I told them: shove it up the big one. Sorry. I said, you want to fire him, come over and do it yourself.
FRANK: You know they won't do it. It's up to you. You gotta be strong.
CAPT. BARNEY: I feel for you, but we got an emergency here. It's a weekend of full moons. Everyone's called in sick. Larry, Veeber, Stanley too. We need bodies out there. I had to put Marcus on Twelve Young. You know he's not supposed to work two nights in a row.
FRANK: You swore you'd fire me if I came in late again.
CAPT. BARNEY: I'll fire you tomorrow. Hell, better than that, I'll forward you some sick time. A week, two weeks off-- how about that?
FRANK: I don't think a week's gonna do it.
CAPT. BARNEY: I'm sorry, Pierce. You're going out with Marcus. Duty calls. The City needs you.
MARCUS: My Lord mother man, you look like hell. What were you drinking?
FRANK: The captain almost fired me tonight. I'm on my way out. Anytime now.
MARCUS: Nobody gets fired. Look at me. Only thing they might do is transfer you to the Bronx. You look like you aged ten years since I rode with you last.
FRANK: The ghosts--
MARCUS: You ever notice people who see shit always, are crazy?
FRANK: I think the worst is over.
MARCUS: It can always get worse. You can't change what's out there, only where you're coming from. You got to let the Lord take over, in here.
