What are the job paths for applied math?
I'm a senior in highschool and I'm considering majoring in applied math and adding a physics or CS minor. I know applied math is more focused on workforce/industry while pure math is more focused on going into academia. I'm just struggling to find people who majored in applied math and now have a job. All the places I've asked seem to be filled with students rather than adults so that's probably why I'm struggling to find examples. I just want to know the path of people and what it takes (do I need a masters, phd, minor, etc).
