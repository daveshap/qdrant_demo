Trying to get back into my past company
Hello r/jobs

I was laid off from SpaceX earlier this year during the 10% cut. They stated multiple times that we are allowed to reapply to any position in which we are qualified for. 
It’s been two months of being upset, angry, and overall down from losing the job I had, I spent a lot of my time in my late teens and early 20s getting the experience to one day work at SpaceX. 

There’s a position open in which I’m qualified for, and I’m really wanting to apply. I have an employee referral in, and wanted to write a cover letter for it. How would I go about writing a cover letter for a company I used to work for?
It’s a slightly different department than what I used to work in, and the reason why I’m trying to go above and beyond is because my last few months with SpaceX were hell in my personal life, some death and loss of family, so my last few months weren’t the greatest as I just kept to myself and worked quietly so I could go home and work out my personal problems, in which management in my old department said that they wanted me to be in the forefront again and work on all the issues but I couldn’t emotionally or mentally put myself there. 

Is this something I should bring up in my cover letter or do I just apply and go for it with a standard cover letter?
