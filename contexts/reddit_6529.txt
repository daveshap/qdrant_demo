Ask /r/jobs: How's your commute?
I've read that the average US commute is [just shy of half an hour](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/22/study-states-with-the-longest-and-shortest-commutes.html). How long is yours? How does commuting affect your life, and if yours is brutal, what are the strategies you use to cope?

Why the heck do I care? I'm a software engineer and business student, and I'm really interested in long-distance commuters and their companies. In particular I'm convinced that there's a lot to gain from organizations adopting more flexible telecommute policies and I'm curious about the barriers to entry for companies in various industries.
