Statistical analysis of two same experimental measurements Say I have two blood samples (Sample A and Sample B).Now, I want to do a measurement (dependent variable, let's call it D) on both samples, at 5 different levels of mechanical stress (independent variable, let's call it I). However, since some calculations is involved to get D and I, and also since the devices have some uncertainty, both dependent and independent variables are reported as: I+/-U1   and  D+/-U2, where U1 and U2 are the total uncertainties for independent and dependent variables, respectively.U1 is composed of device uncertainty only (which is actually the error propagation).U2 is composed of device uncertainty and repeated measurement uncertainty.Say, we want to do 10 measurements at each of the 5 different stress levels (for both samples A and B). Note that, when I plot D vs. I, there will be both vertical and horizontal bars for the uncertainty.Now, I want to see if the difference between D in sample A is significantly different than that in the sample B at each stress level.What kind of statistical test should I use?Regards,
