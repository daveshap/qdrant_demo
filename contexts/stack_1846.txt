the meaning of \u201cNever mind that... \u201c I recently read a NY times article and I am not sure why the writer says \u201cNever mind that...\u201d:<blockquote>  On Tuesday afternoon, townspeople gathered inside the gymnasium here at Uiseong Girls High School to root for the South Korean women\u2019s curling team, whose match against the United States was shown on a big screen as an M.C. leaned into a microphone and banged on a drum.  \u201cI skip dinner whenever they\u2019re playing,\u201d said Chung Poong-ja, 75, who danced on the gym floor once the South Koreans sealed their victory against the Americans. \u201cMy focus needs to be on the match.\u201d  Kim Sung-hee, 67, said, \u201cI lost my voice from cheering so hard.\u201d  It was the biggest, loudest party in the province, and for good reason: The team\u2019s top four players grew up in this small city of about 54,000 people and graduated from this high school. Now, thanks to an improbable run at the Olympics being held in Pyeongchang, about 80 miles to the north, the team- dubbed the Garlic Girls by the Korean press, owing to the region\u2019s production of garlic - seems on the cusp of international celebrity.  Never mind that the Garlic Girls, with their dominant record in pool play, have vaulted themselves into medal position in a sport that is still foreign to most South Koreans.</blockquote>Does it mean \u201cdo not be upset with the fact\u201d? I tried to search and I found \u201cdo not be upset\u201d and \u201cdespite the fact that\u201d, and still I am not sure the meaning of that sentence.And I also would like to know if \u201crun\u201d of \u201can improbable run\u201d means \u201cthe series of successes\u201d. I searched for them on dictionaries but still I am not sure.Please help me. Thank you in advance! (+) Actually I asked this question to my English speaking teacher and he answered Never mind that means despite. But I am so confused cuz if Never mind that means despite, there is no main clause: despite the fact that the girls have vaulted....? It does not make sense to me. If never mind that means despite, how can I rephrase the sentence using despite? My teacher said \u201cdespite the fact that the Korean spectators are unfamiliar with the game, there is local enthusiasm\u201d but I don\u2019t know why \u201cnever mind that the girls have vaulted...\u201d become that sentence. Does my teacher mean \u201cthat\u201d of \u201cnever mind that\u201d is a pronoun so that it is like \u201cnever mind that, the girls have vaulted...\u201d? Then I understand why he said despite.
