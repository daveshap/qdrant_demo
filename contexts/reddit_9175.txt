I’ve compiled all the low-cost medical resources everyone shared in the comments of my last post. Hope it’s useful.
You guys left so many awesome resources throughout the comments of the last post, so I thought I’d consolidate the info into an easier to read list for whoever might need it. I went ahead and looked up each service to verify they are legit, and listed the basic details of each one. 

As always, shop around. Depending on what you need, some services may be cheaper than others.

With any prescription that is more than you’re able to afford, you should also ask your pharmacist about alternative options, as they likely know something cheaper, or they can point out an over-the-counter medication or supplement that can help in the meantime if you can’t afford a doctor. I’ve personally had my pharmacist show me what over the counter medications would help with anxiety medication withdrawal that happens with certain anxiety and depression medications when you stop taking it. They helped me pick a vitamin that would help keep the anxiety at bay a bit so I didn’t have a complete breakdown while waiting for more meds. Pharmacists are a fantastic resource, and they’re happy to help.

Also, try applying for free healthcare. It is available for people in hardship, and there is no shame in getting help from the government when you need it. It doesn’t hurt to just see if you qualify. I’ve used it before, and it can help relieve a little of the stress from poverty to at least know you’re covered if something happens.
