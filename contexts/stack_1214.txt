Network line switch-over in Oracle Data Guard We have a Primary database with a remote Standby which established using Oracle Data Guard. They can be syncing over a private Wireless Network and a Wired LAN (There are two options as network medium)Is there any setting in Data Guard to handle network line failure? For example, I want to set wired LAN as main line and when it is not available data guard automatically switch to wireless network.
