JOHN: Uh, hello?
FRANK: WB2YKXB, who've I got?
JOHN: Name's John.
FRANK: Are you licensed to broadcast, buddy?
JOHN: Look, I don't really remember how this thing works.
FRANK: Listen, you can't broadcast without a license. Unless this is an emergency, you gotta get off the band.
JOHN: Pal, my whole life's an emergency.
FRANK: Where are you transmitting from?
JOHN: Queens, New York.
FRANK: Whatta ya know. Bayside, born and raised.
JOHN: I thought these things were for talkin' around the world.
FRANK: 15-band closes down at night. During the day you can chew the band with China if you want.
JOHN: I can't believe people are still using these things.
