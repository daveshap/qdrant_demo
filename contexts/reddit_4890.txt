I pushed my friends away
They noticed I had been down lately, it's not rare but it's taking me alot longer to recover than before. They tried to ask me and see if I was okay and I kept saying that I'm fine and they should not waste their time on me. I now realize how much of an ass I am, how do I apologize?
