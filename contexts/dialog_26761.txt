JOHN: So this other guy? He's a terminator too, right, like you?
TERMINATOR: Not like me. A T-1000. Advanced prototype. A mimetic polyalloy.
JOHN: What does that mean?
TERMINATOR: Liquid metal.
JOHN: Radical.
TERMINATOR: You are targeted for termination. The T-1000 will not stop until it complete its mission. Ever.
JOHN: Where we going?
TERMINATOR: We have to leave the city, immediately. And avoid the authorities.
JOHN: Can I stop by my house?
TERMINATOR: Negative. The T-1000 will definitely try to reacquire you there.
JOHN: You sure?
TERMINATOR: I would.
