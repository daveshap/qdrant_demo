JETSON: Mrs. Porter is not taking her husband's death well.
SYKES: Did you learn anything?
JETSON: A week ago two men came to see her husband. After they left, he was very frightened. She identified one of the men from a photo I showed her. It was Hubley.
SYKES: Aw-right. What about the other guy?
JETSON: She didn't know him. But she said her son might.
SYKES: Did you talk to him?
JETSON: He has not been home since that day. But she told me where to find him.
