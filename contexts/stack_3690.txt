Analysing discrete data from a factorial experimental design The dependent variable in my data can take on the values 0-7 and is, therefore, a discrete variable. I have data from a number of experiments with one, two, and three-way factorial designs. The previous literature on my topic has just used ANOVA of analyse this type of data. This seems clearly wrong to me and my data rarely meet the assumptions of ANOVA which suggests all the published research on this topic has used the wrong statistical models. My issue is that I don't know what the best approach to analysing this data is. What is the most appropriate model for analysing discrete data using a factorial design? I'm using R to analyse the data.
