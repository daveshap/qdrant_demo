KELLY: The next thing... his hand was in my shorts... you know, from behind. His fingers... his fingers...
GLORIA: Take your time.
KELLY: They were in me. Both places... you know.
GLORIA: I understand.
KELLY: He said something like, Do you want it dirty7" or something. I tried to turn away
GLORIA: Was there penetration? Did he put himself inside you?
KELLY: Yes. I said stop. I screamed. I mean that's how it sounded in my head. He hurt me...
GLORIA: That's okay, Kelly. You're doing fine. But I have to ask you something here. When you say it hurt. Was this the first time a man was inside you?
KELLY: No. I've done it a couple of times, I mean with guys I dated. But this hurt... like, he was built... you know...
GLORIA: He was large?
GLORIA: Did you try to fight him?
KELLY: I... he had my wrists pinned behind me. I remember my hands were cold.'
GLORIA: Then what?
KELLY: He kept saying, Let it happen
GLORIA: You mean he withdrew...
KELLY: Not at first. He was still inside but he wasn't moving or anything... He said we had this secret. And that now he'd be able to help me... because we were close... Something like that. I don't know. It's hard to remember, exactly.
GLORIA: Try, Kelly.
KELLY: I know one thing he said. It was when... when he took himself out and was standing up. He said, Don't worry
