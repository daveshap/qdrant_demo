NORMAN: Thank you. My suit -- Beth said she fixed it --
HARRY: What happened to her?
NORMAN: What do you mean? She's not here?
HARRY: When I woke up, nobody was here.
NORMAN: She was supposed to be watching the sensor for me.
HARRY: Her suit's gone.
NORMAN: Beth left?
HARRY: I thought she was with you.
BETH: ... what do you mean? I'm in the ship.
NORMAN: What are you doing in the ship? Beth?
BETH: Getting food. We were out of food. what's wrong? You sound mad.
NORMAN: Yeah, well, I get that way when I'm facing death and someone deserts me.
BETH: Deserts you? Harry said he'd take over for me.
NORMAN: He what?
BETH: When he woke up, he said we were out of food. He told me to get some from the ship.
HARRY: I never said that.
BETH: Yes you did. Norman, I wouldn't leave you out there. You know that.
HARRY: We never even had a conversation, Norman.
BETH: Harry? That's bullshit. We stood right there --
HARRY: She's cracking, Norman.
NORMAN: You didn't say that about the food?
HARRY: I was just in the cafeteria, there's plenty of food in there. Take a look for yourself.
NORMAN: But why would she -- ?
HARRY: She's lying, Norman. Just like she lied about fixing your suit.
BETH: You get it straightened out?
NORMAN: I think so, Beth. Yes.
BETH: What's Harry doing with your suit in there?
NORMAN: Fixing it.
BETH: Fixing it? But I fixed -- Where'd you get all that?
NORMAN: The refridgerator.
BETH: The refridgerator.
NORMAN: It's a pretty common place to look for food when you don't think you have any.
BETH: That wasn't in there before.
NORMAN: We must've had it delivered then.
BETH: Wait a second --
NORMAN: 1-800-Deepsea delivery. I hear they're good.
BETH: None of this was here before.
NORMAN: Did you look? It was on the top shelf.
BETH: No, it wasn't. I swear none of this was here. None of it. You think he hid it? Earlier. He must've hid it.
NORMAN: You think?
BETH: You don't believe me.
NORMAN: All I know is I opened that refridgerator --
BETH: Damn it, Norman. I swear. I had a whole conversation with the man when he woke up.
NORMAN: This being after you so carefully fixed my suit.
BETH: You think it's me? You think I'm saying there was a conversation when there wasn't?
NORMAN: I don't know, Beth. I wasn't there.
BETH: Damn it, Norman! He's lying. Don't you get it? There is something seriously fucked up going on here -- and he's causing it. Why can't you believe me?
