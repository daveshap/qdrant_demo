STEVE: Does he have to be here in our hair?
HUNSECKER: Why, has he bothered you before?
STEVE: Is it news to you?
HUNSECKER: Son, lots of people tell me I'm a gifted man, but I still can't see around corners.
HUNSECKER: Just exactly what are you so hot about? I mean, I know it's a difficult thing to be an artist in this crudest of possible worlds, but --
STEVE: Nuts! I'm not here as an artist! I'm here as an average Joe, who happens to love your sister Susie!
HUNSECKER: Well, just be careful you don't knock her down, huh?
HUNSECKER: Frankly, son, you lost me on that last hill. Just give us the punch line...
STEVE: No punch line. Maybe I was just admiring your know-how---yours and Falco's.
HUNSECKER: Why do you keep coupling me with Falco?
STEVE: He's here, isn't he? Do you think, sir, when he dies he'll go to the dog and cat heaven?
SIDNEY: Let's forget cats and dogs and other pseudo-literary remarks--- I'll just lay it on the line! What about that big rumpus in my office today? You were there, Frank! Where, according to St. Dallas, J.J. was responsible for the Elwell smear!
HUNSECKER: Don't go wild, Sidney.
SIDNEY: Wild? Take a look at them and see who's wild...
