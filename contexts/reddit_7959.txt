Already accepted one offer of MS with no funding, but a second school just offered me MS + scholarship --- what do I do? Is it wrong to double back on an acceptance?
So in April I was offered an MS in Robotics Engineering at WPI, no funding, with a decision deadline of April 30th. Of the 2 other schools I applied to, 1 had rejected me by April 30th, and the other hadn't sent me a decision by April 30th - so I assumed that was the best I was going to get, and I accepted the offer.

A bit after the deadline, NEU accepted me to their MS in Robotics program, but it was too late. Further, the total cost of NEU (tuition + housing) was looking like it would be about $20k more than WPI - a bit too steep for me to consider doubling back.

But then today NEU sent me a letter saying I was awarded a substantial scholarship. Now its looking like the total cost of NEU is going to be a $5-10k less than WPI, depending on housing expenses.

Some questions:

Is doubling back on accepting an offer bad? Am I massively burning bridges or raising red flags or anything here?

In my own financial interest, is it possible to use this offer from NEU to "haggle" with WPI, especially since there's like a $25k difference in tuition? Or is that idea just as fucking stupid as it sounds?

Are there other considerations I should make in regards to this decision?

* I've looked extensively at the curriculum of both programs, and it seems like the stuff I want to study (computer vision) has similar levels of support at both schools.

* Since I'm going for MS in order to transition from one professional field to another (from radar EE to computer vision CS), I'm not sure how much weight I should put into evaluations of professors and labs and research and such

* Also since I already have a few years of professional experience, I already have a life in Boston. I wouldn't mind Worcester, really, but most of my friends are in Boston, I've become used to living here, and I think I would be a little sad to leave knowing I had the option to stay.

* NEU's Co-Op program + summer internships also could provide financial income to cover even more of the cost that I'm not sure I could cover while at WPI.

Really any advice would be appreciated.
