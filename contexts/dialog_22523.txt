DWAYNE: Jesse?
JESSE: Yeah whaddya want?.
JESSE: I'm at a payphone in Vegas. What's up?
DWAYNE: Vegas! Can you hightail it back here by three o'clock?
JESSE: Why?
DWAYNE: Well, we got the DEA coming down here again, I don't know, sounds to me like they got some more questions they want to ask us.
JESSE: About what?
DWAYNE: Well they really didn't go into any details on the phone, but they did ask for you, and I figure we should try to help them out as best we can.
JESSE: Uh, sure. I hear you.
DWAYNE: So be here at three.
JESSE: I'll do my best...that doesn't give me much time.
DWAYNE: I have complete faith in you. But don't you go speeding.
JESSE: Yeah...see you at three.
EARL: Hi ma.
EARL'S MOTHER: Hi.
EARL'S MOTHER: I didn't know you were coming.
EARL: I was in the neighborhood.
EARL'S MOTHER: Is that the mail?
EARL: Yeah.
EARL'S MOTHER: How's work?
EARL: Well, same ol' same ol'.
EARL'S MOTHER: People have been asking me about that story in the paper. I told them you were the first person on the scene. They were asking me for all the details.
EARL: It was pretty gory ma, let me tell you. But you have to turn all that off, and do your job, just like pop used to say.
EARL'S MOTHER: Did they ever find out who they were?
EARL: Nope. If you're a criminal you don't carry ID, and if you do you're a damn fool.
EARL'S MOTHER: I tell you this world just keeps getting more and more violent.
EARL: At least around here it does.
EARL'S MOTHER: Are you hungry?
EARL: Yeah sure I'll grab something before I go... Hey -- I've got a surprise.
EARL'S MOTHER: You do?
