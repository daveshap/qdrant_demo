LAMAR: Yeah?
DANIEL: It's me.
LAMAR: Hey you guys are becoming famous. I was just watching the news and--
DANIEL: -- Did you set it up?
LAMAR: Yeah. All set. Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock. Room 211. Barclay Hotel on River Street. Oh, and due to your recent notoriety and the heat that comes with it, I'm going to have to increase my brokerage fee to twenty five hundred.
DANIEL: We had a deal.
LAMAR: We had a deal before you and your friends became the new poster boys for crime.
DANIEL: Fine. Ten o'clock.
DANIEL: Sami, tomorrow you lift a wallet from someone who looks like one of us.
JULIEN: What for?
DANIEL: We need to rent a car and for that you need a credit card.
RAYMOND: Why not just steal another one?
DANIEL: Too risky. We don't need to get pulled over because of a stolen car.
JULIEN: Maybe I'm missing the obvious, but why aren't we leaving town? Any place has to be safer for us than Chicago.
SAMI: It doesn't matter where we go. Between Zammito and the FBI they'll find us. We have to end this here.
ZERO: And how do we do that?
SAMI: I don't know.
JULIEN: That's an excellent plan. Very comforting.
DANIEL: We'll think of something.
BONANNO: Why didn't you tell me about this?
ZAMMITO: You have enough to worry about, Angelo. You don't need my problems.
