ANNA: Where've you been?
ERIN: What the fuck did you do with my stuff?
ANNA: Don't use language with me --
ERIN: Someone stole my stuff.
JANE: Nice to see you, Erin. We've missed you.
ERIN: I had photos of my kids, plus a mug --
JANE: -- toothbrush, toothpaste, and a pair of hose. Here.
ERIN: What's going on?
JANE: There may be jobs where you can disappear for days at a time, but this isn't one of them. Here, if you don't do the work, you don't get to stay.
