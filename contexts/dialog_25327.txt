RU'AFO: Gallatin! So the righteous Starfleet Captain finally released you. Did you encounter any problems on the surface?
GALLATIN: No, sir. But it wasn't easy... being among them...
RU'AFO: I'm sure. Just don't forget what they did to us. We'll have them rounded up in a day or two... we needn't bother with the Federation holo-ship any more. Just get the holding cells ready.
