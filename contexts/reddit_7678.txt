How likely is it to obtain an adjunct professor/lecturer position for an undergrad program with just a master's degree?
I have a full-time job, but it grants me a super flexible schedule and plenty of time off. I'd like to teach part time (1-2 classes a semester). I have my BA in political science and want to get my masters in either public policy or public administration (leaning towards public policy).

I've talked with past professors and they said many schools are fine with just a master's, but some may require you to enroll in a PhD program.

Have any of you had success becoming an adjunct professor/lecturer with just a master's?

Thanks in advance!
