OLD SALIERI: What do you want?
VOGLER: I am Father Vogler. I am a Chaplain here. I thought you might like to talk to someone.
OLD SALIERI: About what?
VOGLER: You tried to take your life. You do remember that, don't you?
OLD SALIERI: So?
VOGLER: In the sight of God that is a sin.
OLD SALIERI: What do you want?
VOGLER: Do you understand that you have sinned? Gravely.
OLD SALIERI: Leave me alone.
VOGLER: I cannot leave alone a soul in pain.
OLD SALIERI: Do you know who I am? You never heard of me, did you?
VOGLER: That makes no difference. All men are equal in God's eyes.
OLD SALIERI: Are they?
VOGLER: Offer me your confession. I can offer you God's forgiveness.
OLD SALIERI: I do not seek forgiveness.
VOGLER: My son, there is something dreadful on your soul. Unburden it to me. I'm here only for you. Please talk to me.
OLD SALIERI: How well are you trained in music?
VOGLER: I know a little. I studied it in my youth.
OLD SALIERI: Where?
VOGLER: Here in Vienna.
OLD SALIERI: Then you must know this.
VOGLER: I can't say I do. What is it?
OLD SALIERI: I'm surprised you don't know. It was a very popular tune in its day. I wrote it. How about this?
