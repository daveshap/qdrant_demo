Which is most beneficial: Masters or Ed.D/Ph.D. in Higher Education?
Would it be better to get a Masters of Higher Education coming straight out of undergrad or getting an Ed.D or Ph.D. in Higher Education? I want to be as high as I can in a university, and am extremely ambitious.

I have been told by someone that it might be better to get my Masters first to get more hands-on experience, and then when needed get my Ph.D. or Ed.D.
