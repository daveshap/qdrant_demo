Heavy sleeper who is on call and needs help!
Hi everyone! Does anyone have tips on how to wake up to a phone call if you are a heavy sleeper? Or how to become a light sleeper? I am working in housing and want to better respond to calls while on duty. I currently stay up until 2am or 3am and wake up at 6am because I am too anxious to miss a phone call. I want to eventually move towards being able to sleep around 10pm or 11pm and get a solid seven to eight hours of sleep. Any help would be greatly appreciated!
