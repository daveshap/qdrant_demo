Destroyed my career - what to do now?
So, here’s the story. 

I’m an angry person at times and people know it. I’m baited - I bite and return fire. This has cost me one or two jobs in the past, but I’ve always had something to fall back on. 

This time it was worse. Construction project prestart and I’m getting hassled by my team - I lose it, get up and leave. On the way out I throw my paperwork on the desk of a woman and tell her where to go. She stands up, with my clipboard, and swung it two handed at my face - contact was made, decent hit. I throw a jab back to her jaw. 

I’ve now been black listed in my industry - and have no transferable skills. 

Where do I go to “start again?” I’ve got about two months living expenses and no income. So I’ll need to start quickly.
