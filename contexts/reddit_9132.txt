Today I cancelled a $4000 guitar.
I saved up for this bitch for almost 3 years and placed the order this morning. I was happy for about 10 minutes and then it consumed me. I kept thinking back to the days where I could barely afford food, was drowning in debt, and couldnâ€™t put more than a couple of bucks worth of gas in my car. It took me years to crawl out of that hole and the nightmare of having to live that way again had me physically shaking.

I just called them up and cancelled a few minutes ago and have never felt so good about myself. Thank you to all those who post on here about your situations, it kept me in check today and hope someday it will do the same for you.

EDIT: Some folks were wondering about the model. So here it is: https://www.guitarcenter.com/Jackson/USA-Signature-Misha-Mansoor-Juggernaut-HT6-Electric-Guitar-Daphne-Blue-1500000208344.gc?rNtt=Jackson%20usa%20misha&index=2
