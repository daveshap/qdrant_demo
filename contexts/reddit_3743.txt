Does anybody else feel like they don't find anyone attractive on dating sites/apps?
I've spent the last few hours swiping on people on an online dating app & I feel like the pictures just don't do people justice. I either come across people I don't find physically attractive or those model types where I'm not even going to try to get a match with them. Does anybody else feel that way? Idk if I'm just too picky, too raw from an ex, or what...
