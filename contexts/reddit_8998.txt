Currently Donald Trump is facing a 38% approval rating [Source](https://news.gallup.com/poll/313454/trump-job-approval-rating-steady-lower-level.aspx), and nearly 61% of voters think that Joe Biden needs to prove he doesn't have dementia (38% are already convinced he is suffering from it) [Source ](https://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/elections/election_2020/38_of_voters_think_biden_has_dementia)

Given the trend of unpopular candidates being promoted by both the Republican and Democratic parties, is there a mechanism that enables US voters to deny both candidates even if a more preferable candidate is not on the ticket?
