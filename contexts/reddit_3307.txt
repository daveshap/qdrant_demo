What career fields are worth going back to school for?
So I'm completely lost on what to do with life. Working in an industry I hate, trying to pursue my dream but sadly it's not a stable field so I may never succeed at it.

I currently have a BA in Political Science, but I opted not to go to Law school. I'm trying to decide whether I should go back for another Bachelors degree or maybe a Masters. I'd also like to explore going to school in another country (currently in the US).

I feel like one of the only practical degrees these days is Computer Science, but I'm not a fan of programming.

My main interests are Performing Arts/Entertainment, Languages, Politics, Meteorology or Seismology, Archaeology, and the Travel industry.

I'm just not sure there is any degree I can get in those areas that's going to be that successful.

Are there any other areas I should explore? Anyone have any idea what degrees might be useful from schools outside the US (mainly the UK or Ireland)?
