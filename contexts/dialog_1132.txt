LORL: Madame Cavalieri is here for her lesson, sir.
SALIERI: Bene.
CAVALIERI: Maestro.
SALIERI: Good morning.
CAVALIERI: Well? How do you like it? It's Turkish. My hairdresser tells me everything's going to be Turkish this year!
SALIERI: Really? What else did he tell you today? Give me some gossip.
CAVALIERI: Well, I heard you met Herr Mozart.
SALIERI: Oh? News travels fast in Vienna.
CAVALIERI: And he's been commissioned to write an opera. Is it true?
SALIERI: Yes.
CAVALIERI: Is there a part for me?
SALIERI: No.
CAVALIERI: How do you know?
SALIERI: Well even if there is, I don't think you want to get involved with this one.
CAVALIERI: Why not?
SALIERI: Well, do you know where it's set, my dear?
CAVALIERI: Where?
SALIERI: In a harem.
CAVALIERI: What's that?
SALIERI: A brothel.
CAVALIERI: Oh!
SALIERI: A Turkish brothel.
CAVALIERI: Turkish? Oh, if it's Turkish, that's different. I want to be in it.
SALIERI: My dear, it will hardly enhance your reputation to be celebrated throughout Vienna as a singing prostitute for a Turk.
CAVALIERI: Oh. Well perhaps you could introduce us anyway.
SALIERI: Perhaps.
CAVALIERI: What does he look like?
SALIERI: You might be disappointed.
CAVALIERI: Why?
SALIERI: Looks and talent don't always go together, Katherina.
CAVALIERI: Looks don't concern me, Maestro. Only talent interests a woman of taste.
