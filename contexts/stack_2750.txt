How can a body have two axis of rotation at the same time? I m not concerned with rotation of a body with two simultaneous axis but concerned with how we choose the axis,while going through pure rolling I have observed that there are two axis of rotation one is passing through the center of mass and the other is through the point in contact with the ground,my concern is how can there be any axis of rotation through the point of contact where as m very well finding the body does not rotate in that axis of rotation that is it very well rotates only through the center of mass.
