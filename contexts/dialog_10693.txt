ENID: Oh my god, look! Is Stacy Himmler going out with Rod Harbaugh?
REBECCA: How perfect.
ENID: He better watch out or he'll get AIDS when he date-rapes her.
ENID: God, just think, we'll never see Dennis again.
REBECCA: Good.
ENID: God, think about that... that's actually totally depressing.
REBECCA: Hi.
ENID: Look at these people behind you. I'm totally convinced they're Satanists.
REBECCA: Why?
ENID: Just look at them!
REBECCA: So, when are we going to start looking for our apartment?
ENID: Soon... I have to wait and see how this Summer class goes.
REBECCA: Did you sign up yet?
ENID: Yeah, I just picked the one that sounded the easiest.
REBECCA: God, it's so weird that we're finally out of high school... We've been waiting for this our whole life! Now we can get our own apartment and do anything we want. It's such a weird feeling.
ENID: I know, it hasn't really hit me yet.
JOHN: Well, if it isn't Enid and Rebecca, the little Jewish girl and her Aryan friend.
ENID: You're late, asshole.
JOHN: Fine, and how are you?
ENID: Did you bring that tape?
JOHN: You never paid me for that tape with the Indian dance routine.
ENID: I did too!
JOHN: Tsk! You Jews are so clever with money...
ENID: Fuck you, you stupid redneck hick!
REBECCA: Hey, look, the satanists are leaving!
ENID: We should follow them!
