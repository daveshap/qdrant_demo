JIM: Like even today. I woke up this morning, you know? And the sun was shining and everything was nice. Then the first thing that happens is I see you and I thought this is going to be one terrific day so you better live it up, boy, 'cause tomorrow maybe you'll be nothing.
JUDY: I'm sorry I treated you mean today. You shouldn't believe what I say when I'm with the kids. Nobody acts sincere.
JIM: Why'd you get mixed up with them? You don't have to prove anything.
JUDY: If you knew me you wouldn't say that.
JIM: I don't think you trust anybody, do you?
JUDY: Why?
JIM: I'm getting that way, too.
JUDY: Have you ever gone with anyone who--
JIM: Sure. Lots of times.
JUDY: So have I. But I've never been in love. Isn't that awful?
JIM: Awful? No. It's just lonely. It's the loneliest time.
JUDY: Why did you do that?
JIM: I felt like it.
JUDY: Your lips are soft when you kiss.
JIM: Where you going?
JUDY: I don't know, but we can't stay here.
JIM: Where can we go? I can't go back into that zoo.
JUDY: I'm never going back.
JIM: Listen! I know a place! PLATO showed me before. An old deserted mansion near the planetarium Would you go with me?
JIM: You can trust me, Judy.
JUDY: I feel as if I'm walking under water.
MOTHER: Frank? I'm frightened.
FATHER: What's that pounding?
MOTHER: I don't know. First I thought it was Jim but--
FATHER: He's home. I heard the car.
MOTHER: Are you going down there?
FATHER: Look--just relax, will you?
FATHER: See? It stopped.
MOTHER: I still think you should go down.
FATHER: Who's there? Anyone there?
MOTHER: Open it.
