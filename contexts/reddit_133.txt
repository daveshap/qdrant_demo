Mom Won't Let Me Get TikTok.
Okay so I know this is dumb, but I really want the TikTok app. I \[13F\] am home-schooled and NOT allowed to use any type of social media. All of my friends have it, and I feel that it can be a good way to get to know other peoples interests, and it just looks fun. Is there any way I could discretely have it? I don't think I can get it on my phone, because my mom enabled a thing so she can see all of my activity. She gets kinda creepy with this stuff. I don't even want to post slutty/annoying stuff on TikTok. I just want to do wholesome shit and have fun. I just think she is being weird about it. She doesn't even let me scroll through Youtube half of the time, so I don't think I can convince her. If anyone can think of a discrete way to have a TikTok account, that would be nice.
