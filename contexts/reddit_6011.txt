Finally have a job!
I’m so excited and wanted to let everyone on here know! After about 4 months without a job (hospital stay, compromised immune system, heck life in general) i just got off the phone with the owner of a company for a job offer starting Monday! After literally putting in applications to about 400 different jobs and hearing nothing back from most of them I finally have a job again! 

It’s not my dream job, it’s not somewhere I feel I’ll work forever heck it’s not even as much as I was making in my last job but I have a job!! I can finally begin to pay my bills! I’m still going to have to figure out something about rent next month but I have job! It’s such a weight of my shoulders I started crying when I got of the phone with him. 

I just want to let everyone on here know that things are tough right now and it might not be all smiles but there is hope out there!
