SARAH: Yes, Chuck?
BREEN: Come to the office, please.
SARAH: Mission control to Chuck, come in...
BREEN: You're late.
SARAH: Aren't I worth waiting for?
BREEN: Not really. Do you think you can get here on time if I put you on the floor as a waitress?
SARAH: I don't know. I kinda had my heart set on being a cashier the rest of my life.
BREEN: The pay's the same but you'll make more in tips.
SARAH: Thanks, Chuck. I need the money. Can I still work the hours around my classes?
BREEN: Mmm. Same schedule's okay.
SARAH: Alright!
BREEN: Can you handle it?
SARAH: It's not brain surgery, Chuck.
BREEN: Here you go. You're a Bob's Girl now. Nancy will check you out.
SARAH: I won't let the fat kid down.
