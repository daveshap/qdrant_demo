D'ARTAGNAN: Athos, please...!
ATHOS: Get out of my way.
D'ARTAGNAN: Athos, I beg you --
D'ARTAGNAN: Where are you going?
ATHOS: To kill the king.
D'ARTAGNAN: Athos! I know life means nothing to you at this moment, but I will not let you kill yourself.
ATHOS: The King killed my son!
D'ARTAGNAN: The cannons killed Raoul! The cannons, and love. But not the King.
