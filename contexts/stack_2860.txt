How could an alien mega structure such as a Dyson Sphere be detected? A friend of mine was telling me that if there is an alien structure out there, we could detect it by the energy it would be producing or sending out. Im aware of hubble\u2019s mission (RIP) and how we could make calculations base on transit, but never heard of such a thing... is it true? Thanks in advance!
