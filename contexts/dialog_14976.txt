MAC: Just tell it to me straight, Bren. Do you think this is my fault? Her mother's fault?
BREN: I think kids get bored and have intercourse. And I think Junebug was a dummy about it. But we have to move on from here and help her figure it out.
MAC: I'm not ready to be a Pop-Pop.
BREN: You're not going to be a Pop-Pop. And Juno's not going to be a ma. Somebody else is going to find a precious blessing from Jesus in this garbage dump of a situation. I friggin' hope.
MAC: Did you see it coming when she sat us down here?
BREN: Oh God yeah. But I was hoping she was expelled or into hard drugs.
MAC: That was my first instinct too. Or D.W.I. Anything but this. And I'm going to punch that Bleeker kid in the weiner the next time I see him.
BREN: Oh Mac, no! He's a sweet kid. You know it wasn't his idea.
VANESSA: Hi! I'm Vanessa. You must be Juno and Mr. MacGuff. I'm Vanessa.
JUNO: Vanessa, right?
MAC: Hello. Thank you for having me and my irresponsible child over to your home.
VANESSA: Oh no. Thank you. Come on in.
VANESSA: Can I take your coats?
JUNO: Sure.
JUNO: Wicked pic in the Penny Saver, by the way. Super classy. Not like those other people with the fake woods in the background. Like I'm really going to fall for that, you know?
VANESSA: You found us in the Penny Saver?
