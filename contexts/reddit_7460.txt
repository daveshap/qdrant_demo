Did anybody go back to get their masters in a completely unrelated field?
What was your undergrad major and what are you currently studying? Do you regret it all? What are you looking to do career wise after?

I’m a 26 year old who majored in Natural Resources & Environmental Sciences with a emphasis on Wildlife Conservation. Don’t get me wrong, I love the environmental and helping animals. I’ve worked in labs all throughout undergrad and worked field jobs during the summer. Currently waiting for my next field position to start actually. I didn’t stick with one lab and I never had anything published, I just enjoyed doing the field and lab work. I just don’t think the research side of this field is right for me, and I kinda wish I realized that sooner. Currently looking at other fields that interest me and trying to learn as much as I can about them so I can hopefully make a better choice this time around.
