GASTON: Are you insane? You've to get out of here at once! She may come back any minute.
LILY: What time is your rendezvous?
GASTON: Now, Lily--
LILY: Yes, <u>M'sieu</u> <u>Colet</u>?
GASTON: You <u>have</u> to get out of here!
LILY: That's what I'm here for--to get out! I want to get away from here, from you--as fast as I can and as far as a hundred thousand francs will take me. Sixty-five, ninety-four--
GASTON: Don't you <u>realize</u>--
LILY: Thirty-five to the left--sixty- three, eight ... I wouldn't fall for another man if he were the biggest crook on earth ... Seventy-six, eighty-four, fifty-five-- What has she got that I haven't got?
GASTON: Lily, you must listen to me.
LILY: Shut up! Don't make up any stories!
GASTON: But, Lily--
LILY: Don't you dare lie to me! I know you love me. Well, why don't you say something? Come on--be brilliant. Talk yourself out of it--bluff yourself in! Shut up, you liar, you! That's what I want! This is real! Money! Cash!
