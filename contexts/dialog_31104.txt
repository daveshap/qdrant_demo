SAILOR: The Good Witch...
GOOD WITCH: Sailor... Lula loves you.
SAILOR: But I'm a robber and a manslaughterer and I haven't had any parental guidance.
GOOD WITCH: She's forgiven you of all these things... You love her... Don't be afraid, Sailor.
SAILOR: But I'm wild at heart.
GOOD WITCH: If you are truly wild at heart, you'll fight for your dreams... Don't turn away from love, Sailor... Don't turn away from love... Don't turn away from love.
