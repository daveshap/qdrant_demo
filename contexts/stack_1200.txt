Data Warehouse Kimball Customer and Customer Address Dimensions I have a Customer Table and Multiple Customer Addresses. A customer can have multiple addresses: home, work, vacation,etc.In Kimball data warehouse, would I utilize a bridge table to go between Customer and Customer Address information?(a) So [DimCustomer] to [DimCustomerAddressBridge] to [DimAddress] Table?Would this be the proper technique? (b) Or would I just have a Fact Table, like CustomerTransactionPayment Table, that connects the two Dimensions [DimCustomer] and [DimAddress]?So one strategy is the connected Dims using bridge, and another is disconnected Dims connected by a Fact transaction table?
