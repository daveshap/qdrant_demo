Am i the only one who still “acts like a child” ?
When I get overwhelmed/anxious/panic mode , lately i’ve been resulting in like scream-crying. I don’t know why all of a sudden my normal semi-quiet cries have turned me into a screaming mess. I feel like a child again. I used to have these temper tantrums when i was a kid-flail on the couch & tense my muscles with frustration. I thought i had grown out of that a bit ago but it seems to be back.. I’m a highly sensitive person so anything can set me off into tears-which is my bodies way of releasing the stress i hold in. But it’s just so frustrating. I just like scream cry of frustration because i can’t like let something go, i don’t even know. When a bad thought is on my mind, or even an expectation that i don’t believe i can accomplish/seems to hard to complete, i just get so frustrated that i can’t accept it or take it not as negative as i did, so i like scream and crying for like 20minutes-which if you have ever done, is pretty dehydrating. And when i’m in that “zone” it’s like i can’t even think to help myself, i just feed into the emotions i feel. It’s like i kinda go crazy for a bit, then after i have that guilty shameful feeling of feeling like i acted so childlike & weal & incapable of helping myself. 

Is this a normal response to someone who has been depressed & anxious daily for the past 10 years ? (i’ve been in&out of therapy since then too)

What’s another stress outlet besides crying? (like taking a walk or drawing is not considered a stress outlet for me because it actually causes me more stress; ex- walking outside in public makes me SO anxious/stressed cuz of my social anxiety) plus it doesn’t seem like it “releases” any stress because i don’t feel a relief, i just feel the same..
