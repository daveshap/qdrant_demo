EDDIE: I take it this is the bastard you told me about. Why the hell are you beating on him?
MR. PINK: So he'll tell us who the fuck set us up.
EDDIE: Would you stop it with that shit! You beat on this prick enough, he'll tell ya he started the Chicago fire. That don't necessarily make it so. Okay, first things fucking last, where's the shit? Please tell me somebody brought something with them.
MR. PINK: I got a bag. I stashed it till I could be sure this place wasn't a police station.
EDDIE: Well, let's go get it. We also gotta get rid of all those cars. It looks like Sam's hot car lot outside. You stay here and babysit Orange and the cop. You two take a car each, I'll follow ya. You ditch it, I'll pick you up, then we'll pick up the stones. And while I'm following you, I'll arrange for some sort of a doctor for our friend.
