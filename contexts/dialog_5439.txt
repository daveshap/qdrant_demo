BROCK: Selina, did you make it home, all right? I tried calling, but your mother said that there was no extension in the Hut." Whatever that means.."
SELINA: I got home fine. How's the warehouse.""
BROCK: Fine. You're angry. Don't be. The important thing is we're together now..
SELINA: At some sanctimonious celebration of condescension. Nothing like appeasing half the population with a two hour luncheon.
BROCK: Exactly. I don't know what I'd do without you.
SELINA: Uh Brock, today you are without me...
LANE: There you are darling...Have we met, Lewis Lane, Oasisburg Times.
BROCK: Oh, how long have you had your own route?
LANE: Can I just say what a classy touch the neon urinals are, Mr. Architect? I just love risking electrocution every time I..
SELINA: What's a powerful man like you standing all alone for? Dance with me?
SPOOKY: I'm sorry, Miss, one of us needs to keep surveillance...
SELINA: Oh pooh, come now. If you turn me down, I just might throw a fit..you know how us girls can be..
SELINA: What's it like being a superhero? It must be frightfully exciting..How did you guys all get together?
SPOOKY: We met on the Internet. The Captain put out a cryptic message calling for a new order of crimefighters. We don't even know each other's true identities...
SELINA: You seem sad, Spooky.
SPOOKY: I'm not sad, no, I owe the Captain my life. It's just you think you want to help prevent crime, but you realize that's too complicated. It's a lot more fun to punish crime. Then after a while, you don't care what's a crime and what's not, what you became a Warrior for. You just want the kicks. The rush.
SELINA: The kicks..the rush..you mean, like pulling heists..faking your own deaths..killing innocent bystanders...like Mexican angels. I know you're a woman. Do you?
