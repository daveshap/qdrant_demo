All my friends eventually forgot me.
I know the title sounds stupid but I have my reasons. I am trying my best to keep myself busy and distracted. I always check on some of my close friends regularly after a week or so. Three weeks back I started working on a project and gaming in my free time. Today, I checked my cell phone after three weeks and I haven't received a single call or message from any of my friends or family. All my messages have been read but I never received a response from them. I know people are busy and not everyone is into texting. Even I'm not a fan of it. I realized that my conversations were always one sided. I was actually prying in their life and trying to ask about their well being. I saw their stories and posts, everyone is having a nice time with their family. I have lost the zeal to do anything more and keep myself sane. I tried going back to gaming but in the end it's still bothering me. Can someone provide some suggestions for coping with this loneliness?
