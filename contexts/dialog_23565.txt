JULIET: It's about me and David.
ALEX: The perfect couple, I should say.
JULIET: You mustn't take it so badly.
ALEX: Don't worry about it. I'd do exactly the same, but I don't think I'm his type.
JULIET: Don't you ever stop?
ALEX: No.
MCCALL: Take all the time you like, doctor.
JULIET: I'm sorry, I've never seen any of them.
MCCALL: Look again if you like.
JULIET: No. I haven't seen them.
MCCALL: Do you think you have a good memory for faces?
JULIET: Same as everyone else.
MCCALL: But in your work you must meet lots of different people, every day -- new people, new faces. No?
JULIET: Yes.
MCCALL: And what do you recognize, names or faces?
JULIET: Diseases.
MCCALL: Like recognizing criminals by their crimes.
JULIET: I suppose so.
MCCALL: I mean, that's what it's like.
JULIET: Sorry?
MCCALL: And you said you supposed so, but I wasn't offering it for debate.
MITCHELL: Offering it for debate.
MCCALL: It's like recognizing criminals by their crimes.
DAVID: No, I've never seen them.
MCCALL: You're sure of that.
DAVID: Yes.
MCCALL: That wasn't a question.
MITCHELL: You can tell by the intonation.
MCCALL: One other thing. Do you have any tattoos?
