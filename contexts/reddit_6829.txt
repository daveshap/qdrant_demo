Just Got Fired For The First Time And Not Sure How To Move Forward
I’ve worked in commercial insurance for the last five years, and was let go this morning on a technicality. I think the company is downsizing staff due to current events but they constantly brag about “never laying people off” so they’re letting people go for very minor mistakes. Annoying but not important.

I’ve been looking for another job for a couple weeks as-is, since I’ve started having doubts about the company so I’m almost relieved; I have industry qualifications and 5 years of professional experience (I’m 27). I’m just not sure what the best way to proceed is, if I want to stay in the industry or try branching off to something else. I have two 4 year degrees as well but in poli sci and history. 

How have you guys navigated this before? I have enough in savings and resources to be ok for a while but this is new for me and I’m definitely feeling like the rug has been pulled from under me..
