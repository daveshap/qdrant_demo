EDWARD: What do you charge for company, Vivian?
VIVIAN: Company would cost you... a hundred dollars.
EDWARD: For the whole night?
VIVIAN: For an hour.
EDWARD: You're joking.
VIVIAN: I never joke about money.
EDWARD: Neither do I. A hundred bucks an hour though. That's pretty stiff.
VIVIAN: No, but it's getting there.
EDWARD: Vivian, how much to put up with me for the entire night?
VIVIAN: You couldn't afford it.
