Why don't more ppl apply "he/she is not that into you" when it comes to the dating game?
Seriously.  It's the most simple rule, and it answers 99% of questions you may have.  The vast majority of the time, this reality is the answer to anything you may be wondering about, and will save you some mental torture.  We try to make excuses for ppl, like "maybe he/she is extremely busy" "maybe I said or did something wrong".  No.  They just aren't that into you.  Pppl let a lot of things slide when they are into you.  Fact.  Also, the "busy" excuse.  No.  Anyone who is interested can and will make time for you, or at least go out of their way to let you know they aren't intentionally ignoring you.  Ppl who are interested DO NOT leave you hanging.  Why?  Because they don't want anyone else capturing your attention.

As someone who is guilty of all the "wondering" bullshit myself, I think we in the dating game would have a much easier time if we just look at reality.  The vast majority of the time, if you find yourself questioning their interest level, it's simple - THEY'RE JUST NOT THAT INTO YOU.  Move on.
