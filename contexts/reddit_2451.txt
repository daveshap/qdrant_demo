I YOLO quit my job - what is next?
I am a 24M who graduated with an engineering degree in April 2018. I have been working in a large company in an entry level contract position for 13 months. 

For the past 9 months, I have been supporting two vacant full time employee positions. Each of the two roles has two separate groups of stakeholders and I am caught in the middle trying to please both while seeming incompetent to both as I consistently cannot complete all of the work assigned. 

My commute is approximately 4 hours per day with work hours typically between 8-12 hours. This often results in 12-16 hour days without paid overtime or time off in lieu. 

Senior management has recently started gaslighting me which is really making me question my own sanity. As a result, I walked out of my workplace on Tuesday and haven't returned. I recently liquidated all my investments to ensure I have enough cash to survive unemployment. 

Have any of you been in the same situation? Am I making the right decision? What steps should I take to find a career path that truly interests me? Is it worth a trip to a psychiatrist or my local unemployment office to see if I am eligible for any assistance?

Apologies for the haphazard questions - all advice is truly welcome.
