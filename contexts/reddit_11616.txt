My sister feels we are trying to ruin her life
I am not going to bother you with the whole story, i could even write a book  about it. The thing is that my sister has made some really terrible life choices, is Broke,  cannot support her child, the man he is married to is good for nothing -literally: not a good husband,  unemployed,  has no intelligence nor good looks, etc, etc- and me and my parents have being supporting her family for over a year and the thing is that when we talk to her so she can have a guide to make better decisions she just feels that we are trying to ruin her life. She gets mad and wont listen, but the instant she needs help because of the outcome of a crappy choice she calls us and we fix it. EVERYTIME. And if we give her a piece of advice she just takes it as an insult or something.
Today i couldnt stand it anymore and I yelled to her and said really mean things. I feel like crap and i dont know how to show her that we really want to help. I am really mad at her, also...
