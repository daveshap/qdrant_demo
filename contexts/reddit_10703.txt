Just survived an attempt. Dealing with aftermath.
I tried to overdose on Xanax and alcohol Sunday night. It wasn’t planned. I initially took a bar to ease some anxiety and I ended up going a few too deep. It was an impulsive decision based on recent heavy losses and overall trauma. Apparently I posted on my social media that it was my last post and my reasons including losing my boyfriend, best friend, and rejection from an interest and someone called. I don’t remember writing the post, the cops and EMTs showing up, the ambulance ride, or anything. I woke up very confused. I had dozens of supportive messages online but I can’t help but feel very stupid and ashamed. Did I just label myself a crazy suicide girl? Will people forget? Just looking for support right now. I want to crawl under a rock. I’m in weekly therapy and see a psychiatrist but I don’t know if it’s enough.
