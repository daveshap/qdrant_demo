Because who doesn't like a good theme...
I'm working on RA training and as always I'm trying to come up with a theme that can 1. make everything a little more cohesive, 2. keep my creative juices flowing, and 3. make everything just that much cooler.  And something the students will be able to grab on to of course!

Use this space to brain storm so ideas not just for my benefit (thanks in advance) but also for the general population's benefit!
