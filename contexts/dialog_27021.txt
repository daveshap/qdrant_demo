THEO: You want to move to New York, you want to move in with me?
NELL: I don't know, you know...
THEO: My place isn't like yours, Nell, it doesn't have a view of sea. It doesn't have a view of anything. What's interesting about the way I live is what goes on inside the walls. Living with me... My boundaries aren't very well defined, Nell. Do you know what I mean?
NELL: I'm trying. Have you ever kept something to yourself because you were afraid it'd ruin things.
