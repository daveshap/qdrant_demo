TED: English?
HARRY: That's right.
BETH: I don't get it.
TED: It doesn't make any sense.
HARRY: You don't think it does? I think it's rather obvious.
TED: Is it some sort of joke? Like one of those hoaxes?
HARRY: A spacecraft half a mile long -- with 500 tonnes of coral on top of it? Someone went to a lot of trouble. Try again.
TED: But it's impossible.
HARRY: Is it?
TED: Why would this ship carry instructions in English?
HARRY: Think about it.
TED: Unless, this alien spacecraft was -- you know -- somehow presenting itself to Americans in a way that would make us feel comfortable.
NORMAN: 400 years ago? I'm sure Christopher Columbus would've loved these accomodations.
BETH: Good theory, Ted.
TED: Well, what's your theory?
BETH: I'm a woman. I don't theorize. I only deal with facts.
HARRY: All the facts you need are right in front of you.
TED: Gimme a minute here... I think I've got it.
HARRY: Do you?
TED: If it is an alien spacecraft --
HARRY: Save your breath. It's not an alien spacecraft.
BETH: Then what is it?
HARRY: It's an American spacecraft.
TED: An American spacecraft? Half a mile long? And buried 400 years? Yeah, good theory, Harry.
HARRY: It's been obvious from the start, hasn't it, Captain? That's why all the secrecy, why no one was told about it?
BARNES: We had considered it.
TED: Considered what? That it's American? How would you think it's American?
