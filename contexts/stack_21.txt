USB-C Charging Speeds / Charger Outputs I own a 2016 Macbook (with the USB-C charging) - at the time and in response to all of the reports of poor cables and poor chargers, I bought a meter so I could see what the throughput of my cables/chargers was. However, having run some tests I'm now not sure what to consider normal / what is harmless to the battery. For all tests I used an original Apple C-C cable - though was able to replicate with two third party cables I own.I have the original Apple block charging at 14.3 V / 1.99 A and a third party block that charges the same.Another third party block which advertises USB PD and 3 A is currently charging at 20 V / 1.43 AI've done some research online but I can't find any articles that indicate what a normal USB PD output is relative to the devices that connect to it and would appreciate any guidance / assistance. TL;DR: Have Apple charger which charges at one voltage/amperage. Bought several others advertised at PD which are higher voltage, lower amperage. Not sure what is 'safe', or 'fast', or does least overall damage to battery.
