Healing emotional wounds is uncomfortable, but the short sting beats losing your mind to a lifetime of despair.
Been writing a daily affirmation for myself each morning when I wake up - I check in with what I need for the day and I've found it really helpful. Last night I finally got to talk to a friend I've been feeling a lot of hurt over, it's not all better, but certainly just being able to have a conversation helped.   


Healing from emotional wounds takes action, but I often get stuck in the  fear or laziness of taking that first step - even though I know I'd  feel way better if I did something. It's good to remind myself that  inner conflicts don't just go away, they require communication, therapy,  totally changing my life by moving or traveling, meditating, finding  forgiveness, eating differently - they require me to take action. I want  to feel good in this life, so I do the work on the road to recovery.  And I can't just try once and then give up, I have to keep going and  trust that working through the initial discomfort will eventually lead  to feeling better. Sometimes multiple conversations are needed,  sometimes switching therapists or trying multiple jobs is necessary -  the healing is there, it just takes effort.
