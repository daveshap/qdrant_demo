ANNIE: Crash...I want you.
CRASH: Nuke won't go to bed with you, eh?
ANNIE: He' s confused--
CRASH: Aren't we all?
ANNIE: Don't you think I'm pretty?
CRASH: You're gorgeous, God damn it! From the moment I first saw you I knew I had to have you. I had to have you!
ANNIE: I want to be had.
CRASH: I think of you and the boy" all the time."
ANNIE: He won't make love to me anymore.
CRASH: And he's right! A ballplayer on a streak has to respect the streak. They don't happen very often. You know how hard this game is? If you believe you're playing well because you're getting laid or because you're not getting laid or because you wore red silk panties--then you are! And I still think Thomas Pynchon is full of shit.
ANNIE: I want you desperately!
CRASH: Who are you? Do you have a job?
ANNIE: I teach part time at the Junior College. What if I told you I was through with Nuke? He learned his lessons quickly and left me.
CRASH: And now you wanta teach me?
ANNIE: I don't imagine there's much I could teach you.
CRASH: I doubt that.
ANNIE: Crash, I get wet just thinking about you.
CRASH: I thought you wanted an uncomplicated" boy?"
ANNIE: I'm ready for a complicated man.
CRASH: --and as soon as we lose a game, he'll be back in your arms.
ANNIE: I said when I think about you, I get wet.
CRASH: Annie, I think you should leave.
ANNIE: God damn you--what is happening? Is there no man who'll have me? This is the weirdest season I ever saw--the Durham Bulls can't lose and I can't get laid!
CRASH: You okay?
