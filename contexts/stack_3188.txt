Where did the weapons on the Millennium Falcon come from? In The Force Awakens, Han and Chewie recover the Millennium Falcon and fly to Takodana with Finn and Rey. Before going to Maz's castle, however, Han hands out blasters to everyone. Given that the Falcon had not been in Han's possession for some time, why were the weapons there? I believe that while the Falcon languished on Jakku, it was used for spare parts. At the very least, wouldn't Unkar Plutt have emptied the weapons locker and used them for his own purposes?
