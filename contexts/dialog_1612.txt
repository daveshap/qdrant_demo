DUANE: Alvy.
ALVY: Oh, hi, Duane, how's it goin'?
DUANE: This is my room.
ALVY: Oh, yeah? Terrific.
DUANE: Can I confess something?
DUANE: I tell you this because, as an artist, I think you'll understand. Sometimes when I'm driving... on the road at night... I see two headlights coming toward me. Fast. I have this sudden impulse to turn the wheel quickly, head-on into the oncoming car. I can anticipate the explosion. The sound of shattering glass. The... flames rising out of the flowing gasoline.
ALVY: Right. Tsch, well, I have to-I have t-o go now, Duane, because I-I'm due back on the planet earth.
MOM HALL: Now, don't let it be so long, now.
ANNIE: No.
