MARGIE: You okay?
WADE: Yeah.
MARGIE: I'm sorry about what I said.
WADE: Said what?
MARGIE: About you and Jill and needing a third person. She went back to Lillian?
WADE: Forget it.
MARGIE: I'm sorry.
WADE: I'm going to start one of those custody suits. I don't give a fucking shit. You know?
MARGIE: You don't mean that.
WADE: Yeah. I mean that.
MARGIE: No you don't. You're pissed, that's all. You ought to cool off for a few days then have a long talk with Lillian. You know? Work it out with her, tell her how you feel. Lillian's not out to get you.
WADE: The hell she isn't. Lillian's been trying to nail me to a cross since the day I met her. I'm gonna hire me a fucking lawyer from Concord and get this thing, this divorce thing, rearranged. I've been thinking about it a lot. It's like she owns Jill or something. Nobody owns nobody, especially not kids. And I pay her.
NICK: Marg!
WADE: That goddamned woman. Thinks she can cart Jill off and leave me alone like this. I'm more than pissed, Margie. I'm a whole lot more than pissed. I been that plenty and I know the difference. This is different.
NICK: Marg! You got orders!
MARGIE: Call me.
WADE: Tonight. Let's get together.
MARGIE: Okay.
NICK: You talked to Jack?
WADE: Not since last night. He took a guy hunting.
NICK: The fucker shot himself. Ker-bang! That's what it sounds like. Not on purpose. I assume accidental.
WADE: Jack?
NICK: The other guy.
WADE: Where... how'd you hear that?
NICK: CB. Little while ago. One of the boys on the way in picked up Jack on the CB calling for state troopers. I figured you'd know what really happened. The fucking guy kill himself? This Twombley, who the fuck is he, anyhow?
WADE: No, I... I've been out on the grader all morning. Twombley's summer people. Massachusetts. Friend of Gordon's. It was his idea for Jack to take him hunting. I gotta go.
