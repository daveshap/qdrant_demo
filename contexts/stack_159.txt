Where does apple keeps a copy of files when I turned off iCloud drive? I turned off iCloud drive and gave me a popup stating that all documents stored in iCloud would be removed from Mac and presented three options:Keep a copy, cancel and remove from Mac.I selected \"Keep a copy option\" and can't find files in both my mac and icloud.Where would mac be keeping a copy of my data?Any help would be appreciated.
