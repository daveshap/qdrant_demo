I’m considering becoming a Medical Coding Specialist and need advice about schooling and the job itself
So, I’m 29 and make less than 20k per year. This is due to a lot of things; my own anxiety scaring me away from schooling, and me not fighting that anxiety being the real culprits.

Anyway, I’m throwing that out the window and calling my local technical college tomorrow. I’ve been thinking about going in to medical coding for years. Some reasons why:

-I have social anxiety and am a bit of an introvert, and this job seems like a decent fit for that

-I enjoy using computers in general; just the sound of a keyboard relaxes me a lot

-I need schooling that’s around a year or less (a little more than that is ok too)

-I need to make at least 25k-30k per year within the next 2 years, full time hours are fine for me; this career seems to make that possible

-Seems to avoid weekends, which is important for my circumstances

-I really want a job where when I go home, I don’t take it home with me. I want to do my job, then not think about it

From what I have seen, this career seems to check all those boxes, right?

If so, I really want to look into starting classes. Thing is, for 1 year of schooling, my local technical college estimates around $5000-$5500, and that’s not including books. Does that seem right? For some reason I thought I heard it would be cheaper, but maybe that’s just for 3-4 month certification?

Finally, if $5000-$5500 is accurate, I’m debating how to go about paying for it. I have a decently large chunk of money from a windfall, about $30k, but I’m worrying if I should really use $5k of that on this course. I worry that once I spend it, it obviously won’t come back, so what if this course is the completely wrong decision for me and now all I did was throw away $5k?

Haha, I think I’m a bit of a mess. I really wasted away my 20s and I’m just trying to pick up the pieces. Anyway, any help will be appreciated on schooling, or the career itself. I’m open to alternative options that fit all or most of those things I listed above that I’m looking for.
