anyone gets stomach upset when anxious ?
I always get a very bad stomachache (diarrhea, constant farting and all kinds of smelly stuff) especially when i get anxious - and it’s always my left side of my stomach. Ugh..it’s truly awful..anyone had the same experience or is currently going through it?

Hello again everyone - thank you so much for sharing your experience! definitely did not expect to receive a lot of comments. My only big difference with you is that I’ve never been nauseous but just pumping out a lot of gases haha. Anyway, thanks again for your comments. I’m glad I am not alone in this:)
