JULIET: Who was it?
ALEX: I don't know. He sounded Swedish. Do you know any Swedish men? Maybe it was just the emotion.
ALEX: What do you think?
DAVID: About what?
ALEX: About this guy, this Hugo person.
DAVID: I don't have time.
ALEX: I'm only asking what you think.
DAVID: I don't have time to discuss it now. I don't care so long as he's not a freak.
