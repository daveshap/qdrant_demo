LANDO: I knew that set-up was too good to last .... I'm going to miss it.
LEIA: Luke!
LANDO: What?
LEIA: Luke needs help. We must go back.
CHEWIE: Barks his consternation.
LEIA: Chewie, head for the bottom of the city.
LANDO: Three patrol ships are heading our way.
CHEWIE: Barks an argument and shakes his head.
LEIA: No argument, just do it. That's a command!
LANDO: Wait a minute. We're not going back there.
CHEWIE: Turns on Lando, the newcomer, with an ominous growl.
LANDO: Okay, okay.
