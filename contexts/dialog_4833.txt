COATES: I'm always interested in people in stressful occupations and being a paramedic is about as stressful as I can imagine. Here, sit down. What's it like? Tell me some war stories.
FRANK: Got a beer?
COATES: That shit is poison, Frank. We don't drink alcohol here. What you need is one of these.
FRANK: Did you give Mary something called Red Death?
COATES: Red Death? Tell me something, Frank--does killing your clients make good business sense to you? The kids selling that shit have no sense. They'll be taken care of, don't worry about that.
FRANK: I should be going. I just quit.
COATES: Sleep is all stress reduction. Here. You take one of these, sleep two hours, that's all you need. Why do you think I'm telling you this, Frank--for my health? You ought to look at yourself in the mirror, man. Kanita, get him a glass of water.
FRANK: Is this what you gave Mary?
COATES: That's the stuff. I call it the Red Lion. Very king-of-the-jungle.
