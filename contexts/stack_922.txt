disable mouse/touchpad pointer acceleration & speed 18.04? Ubuntu 16.04 had options tocontrol pointer speeddisable/enable accelerationbut Ubuntu 18.04 does not have any of these options which makes it too irritating to use.<br>It would be so great if the mouse/touchpad (in the case of laptops) experience were similar to that of Windows.Can I achieve similar behaviour in Ubuntu 18.04?
