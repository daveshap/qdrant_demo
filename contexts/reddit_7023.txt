So how do I get a job at a fast food restaurant (McDonalds, Wendys, etc)?
I am 15, and I kinda decided to finally get a job since where i live, they are allowing 15 year olds to work at some places.

I recently found a help wanted sign near McDonalds, and i honestly dont know what to do from there. Do i just go in and ask "Hey could I get a job?" or something?

Yes i do know what a resume is, but idk where to start....
