Ubuntu: keyboard and mouse not working (Mac) -Ubuntu 16.04.4-(Mac)-(Live USB with persistence)-(Created with UNETBootin) First boot, the home screen shows up and i see the cursor at the center of the screen but nothing works (neither mouse or keyboard).I read online that they forgot to install the package during the update or something like this, but I don\u2019t really know how to fix it! Can someone help? \u2014I\u2019m not an expert, i\u2019m using linux for the first time so sorry if i\u2019m not so technical or if i made mistakes...
