JOHN: You must think... I'm the biggest pillock... In the world.
NADIA: No I don't.
JOHN: In the world.
NADIA: I know you just want to punish me --
JOHN: I do. I want to very badly.
NADIA: So you're just going to be vindictive
JOHN: In every sense. If at all possible.
NADIA: You can't hurt me more than I'm hurt already.
JOHN: Well, Nadia, It it's all the same to you, I'd like to give it a bash.
