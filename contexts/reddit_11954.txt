Ouch Mom.
So my mom just told she'd rather me be pan that gay (I explained pan to her last week). Ouch mom. I'd understand if I'd just told you, but I've been out for six months. That stings. If we could have one fucking conversation about this without you bringing up 'I don't want you to put yourself in a box.'

FUCK THAT! I LIKE MY FUCKING BOX! Do you realize how fucking much I've struggled with this? Do you remember me throwing myself at everything with a penis last fall because I couldn't figure out what was fucking wrong with me? Seriously, fuck off!

I have tried everything I can possibly think of to find myself attracted to men. I've fucking tried. Quit saying 'I don't care, but' or 'I'm fine with it, but'. STOP! STOP! STOP! Either you don't mean it or your a shitty communicator. They both make me feel like shit. Please stop.

And now my eyes are watering too much to film my Spanish homework. Fml.
