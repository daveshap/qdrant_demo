What is the severity of Michael Flynn's actions that led to his resignation? Is calling it treason hyperbole? Can he (or others) be prosecuted for his actions?
With the resignation of Flynn, lots of headlines have been flying around on cable news and social media. Many allude that his actions we're treasonous. Certainly they were hypocritical when compared to his past comments towards HRC in the general election: http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/2/14/14609618/michael-flynn-trump-hillary-clinton

Some major organizations claim he's in violation of the Logan Act:

This opinion piece from the Denver Post makes accusations of sedition.

Does any of these fall under what I imagine is a narrow definition of treasonous behavior?

If Flynn is prosecuted, what does this mean for other officials in the admin, or even Trump himself?
