LUKE: I've been with someone for quite some time, and didn't feel it was appropriate for her to move in too quickly. But after a lot of thought and careful discussion with her -- and the kids I might add -- she moved in last month.
JACKIE: Since our divorce Luke has seen a number of different women in three short years and without a lot of warning for the kids, he's now living with a woman half his age --
LUKE: Rachel's not half my age.
JACKIE: We're not discussing your age.
LUKE: Well, we're not discussing Rachel's age either.
JACKIE: They want to be with you Luke, they go to your house to be with their father.
LUKE: Jackie, they come to be part of my life. Rachel <u>is</u> part of that life.
