ADDISON: Then say so.
EVE: Yes, Addison.
ADDISON: And you realize - you agree how completely you belong to me?
EVE: Yes, Addison.
ADDISON: Take your nap, now. And good luck for tonight.
EVE: I won't play tonight. I couldn't. Not possibly. I couldn't go on...
ADDISON: Couldn't go on? You'll give the performance of your life.
