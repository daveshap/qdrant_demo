Laid off in current job before second round of interviews for a job I applied for. What to do/say? Help Reddit!
Ive been looking for another job. I just recently made it to the second round of interviews for a job I am really interested in. Today I was laid off, my position was eliminated. To make things worse I was the only one laid off. My next interview is Wednesday. How do I let the prospective employers know? What should I do. Anybody HR folks out there have any tips? For context I am a Software Project Manager. Would sincerely appreciate any advice.
