Am i being targeted to get laid off?
I work as a dietary aide and my supervisor pulled me in to talk about my performance review. He said that it looked bad but he thought what the review said was completely wrong about me. 

I didnâ€™t understand why this particular supervisor thought of me so badly, especially since i thought he knew me well. What was even more funny was that this particular supervisor gave a good review of a close coworker of mine who is honestly the slowest worker in our department lol.

Is it usual for yearly reviews to have to be a talk with a supervisor? If so what could it mean?
