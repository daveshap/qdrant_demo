[Infographic here](https://i.imgur.com/0uyLhN1.jpg)

Hey everyone! Last week I posted on here asking for you guys to fill out a survey of pretty much everything about you guys -- colleges applied to and results, demographics, stats, etc. Well, after 15 hours of going through all the data, I'm proud to present the r/A2C Class of 2023 Profile.

Some quick stats for you guys:

- There were 605 individual applicants who applied to a combined 397 colleges (amounting to 5,224 individual applications). 44 states and 32 countries are represented (Nevada, Alaska, Hawaii, Wyoming, Idaho, and Mississippi people wya?).

- From those applications, 2,732 of them were accepted, 1,724 rejected, and 711 waitlisted.

- A whopping 27.5% of us are from California; the next two states with the most representation are New York with 7.5% and Massachusetts with 5.6%.

- Our overall acceptance rate was 52.3%, 21.3% of deferred applications were accepted, and our T20 acceptance rate was 23.4%.

- There was a total of 770 different pieces of advice submitted to aid the current juniors and future classes.

- The most popular colleges to apply to were UCLA (169), UC Berkeley (162), and Stanford (145). Similarly, the most matriculated to universities were Undecided (109), UC Berkeley (32), and Stanford (19).

There was no way I could go through all the advice on my own, so after cleaning it of toxicity, I put them all in a Google Sheets document. Let me know if there's any left as I probably skipped one or two. **The advice here is AMAZING. Juniors, take a look or bookmark the page to read later.** Each question is on a different sheet; change them by clicking which sheet you'd like to go to at the bottom of the page.

If you'd like to look up data for a specific university or do some of your own analysis, here is the results and data document. Be sure to make a copy so you'll be able to edit it.

**Disclaimer**: I started compiling data regarding college results at around the 550 response mark, and started doing the rest of the data at 605. Also, I didn't get the answer for matriculation for the first 50 or so responses. So, bear in mind that this data is a bit of a Frankenstein. However, it *does* give good insight to who r/a2c actually is.

Thanks for the inspo /u/adogepepe.
