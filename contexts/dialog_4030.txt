MRS. BEAUMONT: Alright.
AUNT BARBARA: Jeffrey. you're not going down by Lincoln, are you?
JEFFREY: No. I'm just going to walk around the neighborhood. Don't worry.
JEFFREY: Hello. uh. my name is Jeffrey Beaumont. Is Detective Williams in?
MRS. WILLIAMS: Oh, yes, Jeffrey. Come in. He'll be back any minute now. You're welcome to wait. Is it urgent?
JEFFREY: I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. Maybe I better go.
MRS. WILLIAMS: Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
JEFFREY: Alright.
MRS. WILLIAMS: I was sorry to hear about your father. I know your mother from church. It's such a shame.
JEFFREY: Yeah, I know.
MRS. WILLIAMS: Would you like a piece of cake?
JEFFREY: No. No thank you.
MRS. WILLIAMS: It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. real good.
