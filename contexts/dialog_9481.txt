TYLER: She is a wild, twisted bitch. Stay away from that one.
JACK: Oh, and my pace is more librarians.
TYLER: Hey... don't knock librarians.
JACK: Marla doesn't need a lover. She needs a case worker.
TYLER: She needs an exorcist. This isn't love. This is sport-fucking.
JACK: She'd invaded my support groups, now she's invading my home.
TYLER: Listen... do me a favor... sit here a minute...
JACK: What?
TYLER: You've gotta understand something about me. I have a little rule, okay? Don't ever talk to her about me. Ever. I can't stand that kind of shit.
TYLER: If you ever say anything about me or about what happens here in this house, to her or anyone -- I will find out. And you'll never see me again. Promise me.
JACK: Okay.
TYLER: Promise you won't.
JACK: Yes, I promise.
TYLER: Promise?
JACK: I said I promise!
TYLER: That was three times you promised.
