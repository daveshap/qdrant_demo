Black screen when using 4 ram sticks on brand new iMac 5K I bought a 5K iMac 4 months ago, with the stock 8gb of ram. I bought an extra 2x4GB off Amazon (Crucial Ram). But then, it looks like I cannot use all 4 ram slots at the same time. The iMac won't even start, only show a black screen.The Crucial ram sticks are 100% working, since I tried removing the original ram sticks, using only the new ones, and the mac boots and runs fineRight now, I am running the iMac with 3 of the 4 sticks, so at the moment I have 12gb of ram.I tried using the top 3 slots, it works. Bottom 3, it works.2 slots works too.But as soon as I insert a 4th ram stick, it stops workingI have resetted the SMC and NVRAM. Still no luckAlso updated Mojave to 10.14.2 (latest version)Any ideas?I would like to see if there's anything I can try before setting an appointment with Apple for this, since it's my main working machine, and I need to work on some projects right now.Thanks a lot!Here's the Ram kit I have bought:Crucial 8GB Kit (4GBx2) DDR4 2400 MT/S (PC4-19200) SR x8 SODIMM 260-Pin MemoryI've read multiple comments on Amazon about this kit working fine with 5k iMacs...so I'm not sure what's going on here. Thanks
