I have a written offer, but have not been given any paperwork. Should I quit my current job?
So I'm in a bit of an interesting situation. I currently work as a teacher and was given a written offer of employment at a school that pays much better about 6 weeks ago. The new school wants me to start working in about two week from now. The problem is that I have not received any kind of paperwork (W-4, I-9, etc.) from the new school yet. Should I put in my two-week notice at my current school and trust that the new school will follow through, or should I just keep working where I am at and not quit? 

I am not bound by any kind of contract as I am an at-will employee at my current school and I will be an at-will employee at the new school as well. I just don't want to put in my two-week notice and find out that the new school wasn't serious about hiring me and pulls the plug on me at the last moment. Is it normal for an employer to wait until the last moment to give out paperwork for a new hire?
