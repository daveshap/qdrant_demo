LILA: Oh! I didn't see you there, sneaky boy! You're like a boy sneaking in...
NATHAN: ...the back door of a movie theater. Yes, indeed.
LILA: You remember that from my book? I'm touched! What's wrong?
NATHAN: Nothing. Hard day. Gonna have a drink.
LILA: I'll make it. I'm so happy, Nathan! Everything's going to be so great! Scotch on the rocks, right? Just kidding. I know what you drink, mister. I know what you drink. Voila!
