MIKE: I'll need more men to look.
CALVIN: Can't help you, Mike. Don't have the manpower.
MIKE: We're going to have to cover the entire lagoon.
CALVIN: I know, but you're just going to have to find another way. So you better start.
KATHRYN: I think they'll come out now.
RUTH: They still seem nervous.
KATHRYN: I know.
MIKE: They're coming with us?
KATHRYN: We play hide and seek all the time. They find a lot of things.
MIKE: Where's the rubber band?
KATHRYN: Look, Michael... you don't have to come.
MIKE: I don't have a choice.
