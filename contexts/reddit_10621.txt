TIL Nobody actually takes your mental illness and suicidal thoughts seriously, even your doctors and therapists.
Everybody thinks you're just being immature or finding excuses for your failures. The only time they realise that you're really in trouble and need supports and helps is when it's all too late.

You might think the "professionals" would act totally different. But the truth is that the therapist I met literally told me to grow up and be responsible, and that the doctor I saw more or less implied he couldn't help and wouldn't care as long as it's my life not his child's.

I'm trying to gather the courage to off myself within one or two days. Don't want to live through a life I'm incapable of living through while nobody cares at all.
