Not sure if I was meant to do better in life
I've been working in restaurants for over 8 years and I'm sick of it. I want to leave this hellish job and find something better. I've always wanted to work in an office/corporate job. I feel like it's a whole lot more respectable than waiting tables/bartending.

I've applied to 90 places over the past 5 months and they've all rejected me. The jobs I've applied for were for business admin, data entry, sales, customer service, and general office clerk. I feel like I'm just too dumb/useless to work a "real grown up job". All my coworkers at my current job are under the age of 25. I feel so weird/bored working with a bunch of kids. 

I thought about going back to school, but idk....I really got to think about this. I already dropped out of school like 3 times now. I've failed a lot of classes and switched majors like 3 times. I don't want to o back to school and end up wasting more time and money like I did all those years ago.
