MARTIN: You’re out of your mind. What’s the idea?
LOMBARD: Maybe the thought of people like you going on holiday bothers me. Come on, let’s go...
LOMBARD: Is it real? You people are sick.
MARTIN: Huh. I’d have thought a tough guy like you would know better. The sick ones are out there, friend. They make up the clientèle. Get rid of them and we’re out of business.
LOMBARD: Only feeding the disease, eh, Martin?
MARTIN: Money talks, bullshit walks, whether you like it or not.
LOMBARD: Maybe I don’t.
MARTIN: Maybe you should. Think about it. Those who can afford our goods do their thing without upsetting anyone. Those who can’t do it to kids from the streets or their own family and it makes upsetting headlines.
LOMBARD: I’m overcome by your public-spiritedness.
MARTIN: Boys like the one you met today are surplus. Commodities worth a handful of notes in whatever arsehole of the world they happen to be born into. We improve some lives buying them where they’re not wanted, improve still more selling them where they are. Is that too hard for you?
LOMBARD: You know what, Martin? I ought to tie you down with your old arse up in the air and advertise the hole in the middle of it to the world. Free. And hope you never die.
MARTIN: Huh... I’m sure there’d be lots of takers.
LOMBARD: Could someone have hurt you that bad?
