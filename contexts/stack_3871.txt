Suitable project for reinforcement learning To get more insight in reinforcement learning I'm looking for a project for. I thought about the game connect four. Doing some research about existing works with RL and connect four I found out that there are plenty other ways to teach a computer this game. That was to be expected. So the question arises as to whether RL might be a bad idea or even an overkill. If similar or better results can be achieved in an hour with simpler/ more common approaches like decision trees or MLP, I'd rather not continue with this project. If I could at least beat simpler approaches, I think I'd try. Another question is how much work this task requires. Of course this depends strongly on the knowledge of RL. I have basic knowledge of general Machine Learning and common Deep Learning approaches. Are we speaking about hours, days weeks or even months to set up such a model and train it?
