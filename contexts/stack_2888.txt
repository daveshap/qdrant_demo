Energy lost through phosphorescence? I have done a lot of research on phosphorescence and luminescence,  and I believe that UV markers rely on the effect of phosphorescence i.e. they take in UV radiation and give back radiation in the visible light spectrum (purple), which has a lower frequency/energy.This is what I saw on Wikipedia<blockquote>  Fluorescence is the emission of light by a substance ... In most cases, the emitted light has a longer wavelength, and therefore lower energy, than the absorbed radiation</blockquote>Where does the energy go? It surely cannot vanish!Tell me if this effect applies for phosphorescence as wellBTW: Try to keep the language of the answer simple (I'm 14)
