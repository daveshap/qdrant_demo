DETECTIVE HUGO: I don't understand why you were dragged out here, Sir. It's hardly worth wasting your time--a no-nothing case like this.
INVESTIGATOR: A man's dead, Detective.
DETECTIVE HUGO: Of course, Sir. We're checking the entry log, alibis, grudges...
INVESTIGATOR: Grudges?
DETECTIVE HUGO: I look around, I see a lot of dry eyes. The Director was not... ...universally loved. He was leading the cut-backs in the program. You're looking at a room full of motives.
INVESTIGATOR: No, <i>this</i> is your man.
DETECTIVE HUGO: With respect, Sir--it may be the only unaccountable specimen but the profile suggests--
INVESTIGATOR: --What <i>about</i> his profile?
DETECTIVE HUGO: According to this, he's a sick man. Congenital heart condition. Who knows how long the specimen has been here but there's an 80 percent chance the owner of that eyelash has already died himself from natural causes.
INVESTIGATOR: So there's a 20 percent chance he's <i>not</i> dead.
DETECTIVE HUGO: Even if this Vincent Luca <i>is</i> alive, is it likely he could bludgeon a man to death?
INVESTIGATOR: No. Not <i>likely</i>.
