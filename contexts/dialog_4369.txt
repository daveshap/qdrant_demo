JEREMIAH: That's what?
BILL: That's some terrible shit.
JEREMIAH: Clean your mouth, or I will. Those boys had no business messing down there. Go places you're not meant to be -- that's what you get.
BILL: But that's your old hood, Pops.
JEREMIAH: Yeah, and it took some doing to get out of there. Just be glad I did and you can start life from here instead of down there.
PATRICK: But maybe we're the ones who should be down there. Doing something. Making it better.
JEREMIAH: Can't be done. That place already died and gone to hell.
PATRICK: Careful. That's bad luck.
CINNABAR: That place is already bad luck.
PATRICK: Why?
CINNABAR: No. It goes way back. Or so my Momma says.
PATRICK: What else does she say?
CINNABAR: Nothing. You'd think she was crazy. And she is a lot of things, not all of them nice, but crazy Momma's not.
PATRICK: Way I figure, everything our parents tell us is part true and part total B.S. And our whole job is figuring out for ourselves which is which.
CINNABAR: My momma says every house is two houses. Every street, two streets. There's a whole city, a whole world, kinda beside, on top, just below this one. The city of the dead.
PATRICK: Like right now, there's actually like hordes of dead people shambling around us? Fingers rotting off?
CINNABAR: Maybe. But there's an invisible wall, a fabric that kinda keeps things separate.
PATRICK: Lucky thing.
CINNABAR: Yeah. But when something bad happens, something really bad -- the wall breaks. The fabric tears.
PATRICK: The dead get out?
CINNABAR: Or the living fall in. Who knows.
PATRICK: And you believe her?
CINNABAR: If I did, I wouldn't come within fifty yards of your door.
