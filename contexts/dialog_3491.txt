WILL: Mom, do you want some time with Dad?
SANDRA: Yes. Thank you.
JOSEPHINE: I'm sorry. It seems every hour I have to...
SANDRA: I know. It was the same when I was carrying Will. Like clockwork.
SANDRA: Do you like it, being pregnant?
JOSEPHINE: I do.
SANDRA: I loved it. It sounds peculiar, but I loved every minute of it. I did. Eddie was travelling a lot, so he was gone, but I felt like I always had a piece of him with me. A little part of his soul inside me. I could feel it. It was alive and kicking.
