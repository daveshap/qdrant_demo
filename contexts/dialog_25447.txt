RUBY: Did you need something?
PICARD: Yes... I wanted to ask you about some photographs I saw out at the silo. There were three of them... printed on some kind of fabric.
RUBY: Bed sheets. I used my last set of bed sheets to make those prints. Not the best material, but I haven't seen a clean piece of paper in five years.
PICARD: Did you take any other pictures of the rocket?
