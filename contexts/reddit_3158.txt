How do I tell my boss that I don't want to do a company wide presentation?
***UPDATE***

I'll likely just do the presentation begrudgingly. I had a mini presentation that went well today which has given me some better feelings towards it.

However, I don't think people should be pushed to do what they don't want to do and they should create their own goals with their managers, not have things foisted upon them. Allowing people to grow at their own pace within their own bounds is crucial for authentic, healthy development.

Also there's a difference between being encouraged and being carelessly pushed.

Thanks to the nice people who commented!

-----------------------------------

It pretty much says it in the title.

I have manageable but very present social anxiety and despite this have taken on more and more team and client presentations over the past year. Now my boss is pushing me to do a company-wide presentation as a challenge. I haven't revealed that I have anxiety but I identified that I was proud of my group leadership in my performance review which is why I think I'm getting this 'push'. 

Frankly, I'm too anxious to. Already have lost sleep over the idea. It's too much of a jump too soon. I should add that this presentation has nothing to do with my day to day job and my boss isn't asking this of any other team member.

How do I communicate to her, in a professional way, that I want to decline this suggestion?
