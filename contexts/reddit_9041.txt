Does the media have an obligation to treat candidates or parties fairly, and if so, what is the best way to do so?
Yesterday, in Laos, US President Barack Obama repeated the notion that US Presidential Candidate Donald Trump was being [graded "on a curve"](http://www.npr.org/2016/09/08/493113613/obama-chides-that-donald-trump-shouldnt-be-graded-on-a-curve). That narrative has been pushed by [Callum Borchers of the Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/09/07/how-the-media-grades-donald-trump-on-a-curve/). Clinton surrogate Lanny Davis has suggested an "undisputed" [media bias against her](http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/09/07/hillary-clinton-and-undisputed-media-bias-against-her.html).

Similarly, [The Media Elite](https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Media_Elite.html?id=aU4Ff-8AKN0C) (Robert Lichter, 1990) has been the touchstone communication research book for people who claim that the media has a bias towards liberal thought. Justin Raimondo, a conservative pundit, has similarly accused the media of being [unfair to Trump](http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-raimondo-trump-media-bias-20160802-snap-story.html).

Further still, there's a narrative that the media has a [neoliberal bias](http://digitalcommons.georgiasouthern.edu/etd/622/). The case is made that this links to a [substantial media bias against Sanders](http://www.vox.com/2016/4/7/11378858/sanders-media-bias).

Journalists have a concept known as [journalistic objectivity](https://www.americanpressinstitute.org/journalism-essentials/bias-objectivity/lost-meaning-objectivity/)- which some journalism schools will teach as a combination of [depersonalization and balance](http://www.uow.edu.au/~sharonb/STS218/media/objectivity.html). Further still, there's a trend towards a ["data journalism" school, as practiced by the NYT Upshot, Vox, and FiveThirtyEight](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/apr/22/upshot-vox-fivethirtyeight-data-journalism-golden-age), which seeks neutrality through data-backed arguments. Even this has been perjoratively labeled ["line chart liberalism"](https://jasonlefkowitz.net/2014/01/against-line-chart-liberalism/), given the bias inherent in curating the data that's presented to the reader.

* Does this journalistic objectivity matter, and if so, how much? 

* Does it matter more or less when voters are closer in time to being asked a ballot question? 

* Are there certain journalistic methods that are more objective than others? Are journalists suppressing legitimate dialogue by selecting those methods?

* Does overtly agenda-driven media get a pass?

* Are there ways that a government can regulate or deregulate media that could change the ethics of an organization's journalistic objectivity?
