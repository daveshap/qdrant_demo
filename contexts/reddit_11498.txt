I have no one to talk to and everything is going to hell.
Sorry I just have to get this off my chest because I feel so isolated. I just moved to a new city a year ago, and my one good friend here is kind of flaky.  I had a social circle, called one of them a bitch and now I have no acquaintances (Yeah, longer story, my fault). I thought I had another close friend, but he was telling that same circle of friends what I had been confiding to him all along. 

So I feel betrayed.  My family is falling apart.  My stepdad has been cheating on my mom and was recently found out.  I broke up with my boyfriend (it was mutual) two weeks ago.  

I'm in grad school right now. I made a huge mistake.  I don't want to do what I'm going for anymore and I'm in a very specialized field so if I want to change careers I have to go back to school.  I'm in a ton of debt so I can't go back to school.

When I try to talk to family about my problems, my mom just says "God has a plan for you." Which is almost insulting and is certainly infuriating since I don't believe that at all. Plus, she then tries to convert me. And on top of all of that I feel horrible even bothering her because of what she's going through.  

I'm so frustrated and I have no idea what I should even be doing to fix my situation.  Thanks for letting me vent.
