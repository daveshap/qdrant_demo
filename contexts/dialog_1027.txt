MARGO: I distinctly remember striking your name from the guest list. What are you doing here?
ADDISON: Dear Margo. You were an unforgettable Peter Pan - you must play it again, soon. You remember Miss Caswell?
MARGO: I do not. How do you do?
MISS CASWELL: We never met. That's why.
ADDISON: Miss Caswell is an actress. A graduate of Copacabana School of Dramatic Arts. Ah... Eve.
EVE: Good evening, Mr. deWitt.
MARGO: I had no idea you knew each other.
ADDISON: This must be, at long last, our formal introduction. Until now we have met only in passing...
MISS CASWELL: That's how you met me. In passing.
MARGO: Eve, this is an old friend of Mr. deWitt's mother - Miss Caswell, Miss Harrington... Addison, I've been wanting you to meet Eve for the longest time-
ADDISON: It could only have been your natural timidity that kept you from mentioning it...
MARGO: You've heard of her great interest in the Theater-
ADDISON: We have that in common.
MARGO: Then you two must have a long talk-
