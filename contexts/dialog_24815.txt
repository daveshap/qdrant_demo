STAN: What...
BIG THING: Behold my glory.
STAN: What... are you?
BIG THING: I am the clitoris.
STAN: The clitoris?! I DID IT!! I FOUND THE CLITORIS!!
BIG THING: Stan, your friends need you. They are in trouble and you must help them.
STAN: Wait, you're supposed to tell me how to get Wendy to like me.
BIG THING: There are more important matters right now...
STAN: NO WAY, DUDE! I'VE LOOKED ALL OVER FOR YOU, AND NOW YOU HAVE TO TELL ME HOW TO GET WENDY TO LIKE ME!!
BIG THING: Dude, she's eight years old, just get her some ice cream or something.
STAN: Of COURSE!! Ice cream!!
BIG THING: Now go, your friends are in danger... The USO show is a mile east of here, just over that ridge. The clitoris has spoken.
WENDY: Stan! Stan are you okay?!
STAN: Wendy?
