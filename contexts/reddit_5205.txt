Chemical engineer, Can't find a job. What else should I do? looking for advice.
It's been two years out of university, I found a position as a supervisor for a small laboratory. But I wanted to get more onto the industrial side of things.

I've applied to a LOT of positions with little to no luck. I am going back to university for a masters, but I feel like it might be useless, as I couldn't even find a job as a chemical engineer bachelors. 

I'm starting to wonder if there are better options in another technical field. Do you have any advice?
