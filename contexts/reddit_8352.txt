Is there any evidence that mental health restrictions significantly reduce gun homicides?
According to [this study](https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/pdf/10.5555/appi.books.9781615371099), mass shootings by people with "serious mental illness" only account for around 1% of gun homicides. [The US averages around 11,000 gun homicides a year](http://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/region/united-states). Is there any evidence that strict mental health restrictions have significantly reduced gun homicides? What degree of mental illness, being prohibited from purchasing firearms, has been shown to accomplish this significant reduction?
