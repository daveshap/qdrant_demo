RONNIE: GODDAMMIT, RAE!
LAZARUS: BOY! YOU KEEP THAT GUN POINTED AT ME! You need to kill a man, all you gotta have is a good reason. You know she been here with me, don't cha? Been all over town, givin' up that switch you thought was your own.
RONNIE: SHUT UP! SHUT UP!
LAZARUS: Put all your love and dreams into one woman... she turn around and give it all to another man. That's a good reason to paint the wall with me, kid. She'd fear ya then. Cuz there won't be no more question in her mind. She with a real man now. A real KILLER!
RONNIE: Don't... don't say that to me...
LAZARUS: Son, I'm grown. Don't got patience to suffer you children and this monkey junk. I'm too old to play house... ...and cowboys. So let's have it. End me or get out of my face!
