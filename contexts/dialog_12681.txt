MCCLEOD: I cannot stay.
ISABELLE: Why not?
MCCLEOD: I'm leaving in the morning.
ISABELLE: Leaving? For how long?
MCCLEOD: You'll no see me again.
ISABELLE: Why?
MCCLEOD: I cannot explain.
ISABELLE: Do you love me, Conner?
MCCLEOD: Aye.
ISABELLE: Then take me with you.
MCCLEOD: Where I'm going you cannot follow.
ISABELLE: Why are you doing this?
MCCLEOD: Because, it's for the best. There are somethings that are better left unexplained.
