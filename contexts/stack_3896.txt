How do Bayesians gamble? Try to earn the most at this game:there are two discrete random processes x(t) and y(t) with two unknown continuous distributions, both are IID processesat iteration (t-1)you pick either \"x\" or \"y\to be used in the following iteration tat iteration tboth x(t) and y(t) are revealedif you picked \"x\" at t-1 your reward is x(t) dollars, otherwise it's y(t) dollarsthen you pick \"x\" or \"y\" again and the game repeats ...Frequentist strategyat iteration t, estimate the mean E[x] and E[y] , averaging the t past samples of x(t) and y(t) respectivelypick \"x\" or \"y\depending on which of the two random processes has the highest estimated meanBayesian strategy?Help! What would a Bayesian do?
