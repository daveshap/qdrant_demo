How to know if your job is at risk?
Last month, I got promoted to a leadership position in a bad department. I got on-the-job training from my supervisor.

At the conclusion of my training, my supervisor told me I was doing great, but they never told me to update my credentials; nor did they extend a formal offer—customary procedure in the company.

In fact, they didn’t extend an offer until I messaged their supervisor, asking if I could chat. Instead of replying to my message, they simply told me they’d like to extend a formal offer and that my pay would be upgraded immediately.

Fast forward a couple weeks, they haven’t upgraded my pay, and they haven’t extended the formal offer in writing.

Our department has been failing to meet numbers this whole time, and it’s so bad that I have begun to wonder if they’ll even want to retain me.

But I texted my boss’s boss to ask if I was gonna get my official promotion, and they say they’ll bring a formal letter to the office tomorrow.

But they never show up to our office, and my boss was off today. So are they just saying that, when they’re actually planning on delivering bad news?
