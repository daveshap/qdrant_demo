ELAINE: -- Viktor, are you with her? Is she there?
VIKTOR: No.
ELAINE: Are you and Simone... ... getting married?
VIKTOR: No, of course not! Why? Would you care if we were?
ELAINE: Well, yes. From a studio point of view, it would be better if Simone stayed single. Anyhow, I thought she came across great tonight. Intelligent, well informed, a natural. And touching. She was spectacular.
VIKTOR: Thank you.
ELAINE: Viktor, do you realize you always do that?
VIKTOR: Do what?
ELAINE: Whenever I compliment Simone, you take the credit.
VIKTOR: I do?
ELAINE: Yes, you do... Anyway, tonight was a good start.
VIKTOR: Excuse me? Start?
ELAINE: It's a crowded summer. We need every photo-opp, sound-byte and column inch we can get. Good night, Viktor.
LAINEY: Mom, do you miss Dad?
ELAINE: Sometimes. But, just when I think your father's changing for the better, I realize he's as self absorbed as ever. He took the credit for Simone tonight.
