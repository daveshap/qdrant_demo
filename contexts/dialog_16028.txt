RAY: Here, this belongs to you. It was empty when I found it.
CLAUDE: Good old Monroe.
RAY: What I want to know is what happened to your cush between the time that you got up from the table and when I caught up with you in the Johnny?
CLAUDE: I don't see where that's any of your business.
RAY: Did those two muscle heads shake you down? Swear I've seen them down at the track with Sure-shot Riley. That's it, ain't it? A gambling debt.
CLAUDE: Where they taking us, anyway?
RAY: Probably to Spanky's headquarters down at the pier.
CLAUDE: Good, I'm looking forward to meeting this Spanky. Give me a chance to straighten out this whole mess.
RAY: I can't wait to see that. You slay me, man.
CLAUDE: What are they gonna do to us?
RAY: You? Dine and ditch, right? Over ten bucks? You're probably looking at a thumb.
CLAUDE: A thumb? What do you mean, like cut it off? For ten bucks? That include the tip?
