Has anyone else had their imposter syndrome flair up after not losing a job during layoffs? How have you dealt with it?
First off I just want to say I am very fortunate, and I am very grateful for still having a job. I don't want to give up because I was given this opportunity so I better make the most of it. Any advice on how to move onward and upward when you're feeling survivors guilt and imposterish, would be very helpful.

The company I work for was just cut exactly in half. In a small company that feels really personal and not to mention we're in a fairly small town where everyone knows everyone. 

I was fairly new, and although I recently was getting over my imposter syndrome for being new and young. It came back full force right after "mourning" the loss of co-workers that I admired and that I felt were very hard-working. 

My job hasn't changed much since I am the only person who was doing my particular jobs and I had already been covering for another employee who was often absent for the past year or so. In fact my job has been a lot slower since people were let go.

Because of this I am panicking a little because of the lack of immediate fires to put out. And knowing that other people have massive new fires I was trying to streamline some of our processes to make life easier for others, but I may have frustrated them more. 

I feel guilty for still having my job. I feel guilty for not having a bunch of new responsibilities (yet). I know I have been working hard to make this workplace better and have been pretty well appreciated by management, but I can't help but feel guilty about others who loved their jobs losing them. And I'm feeling unreasonably useless right now. I know better, but I can't help but feel it and I am struggling to power through.

TLDR: I have a job even though our company downsized by half. Im struggling to move forward because I feel guilty and like an imposter. 

Any advice is appreciated, no matter how blunt.
