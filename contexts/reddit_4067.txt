What is the point of Bumble exactly?
I'm seriously beyond frustrated have now been trying internet dating for the better part of 10 years and not once has it landed me a single relationship. 

I get matches no problem but each and every time on this stupid app I get a message from the girl I respond to what is usually just a " Hey" or " what's up" with my greet in return and before the conversation goes anywhere or leads to a date the girl just seems to forget she even messaged me and doesn't respond. So why even send me a message? Why is my time being continually wasted?

So why girls? Why are you on this site if you don't have any serious intent on actually going on dates having sex and who knows maybe having a fucking boyfriend. 

Make a fucking effort please for the love of men.
