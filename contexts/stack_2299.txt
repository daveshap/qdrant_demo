Can I check my bonus XP without sleeping in an inn? Early in chapter 1 you learn that sleeping at an inn lets you use bonus XP earned from doing quests to level up.However, you can only use the bonus XP if you have enough to level up. I\u2019ve had times where I\u2019ve spent money to sleep in an Inn, only to realize I couldn\u2019t use any of my bonus XP.Is there a way to check how much bonus XP I have saved up before sleeping at an inn?
