SUGAR: Yes, they're here. Oh - white orchids. Would you believe it - I haven't had white orchids since I was a debutante. What's this?
JOE: What's what? Oh, that. just a little going away present.
SUGAR: Real diamonds. They must be worth their weight in gold. Are you always this generous?
JOE: Not always. But I want you to know I'm very grateful for what you did for me.
SUGAR: I didn't do anything. It just happened.
JOE: Oh. The navigator just came in - we're ready to cast off.
SUGAR: Well, anchors aweigh, you have a bon voyage. And if you need an orchestra to play at your wedding, we'll be through here in a couple of weeks.
JOE: Goodbye, my darling.
JERRY: I don't know about the captain - but the navigator is getting his tail out of here.
JOE: Yeah - lets shove off.
JERRY: Wait a minute - my bracelet. What happened to my bracelet?
JOE: What do you mean, your bracelet? It's our bracelet.
JERRY: All right. What happened to our bracelet?
JOE: Don't worry. We did the right thing with it.
JERRY: What did we do? Joe, you're not pulling one of your old tricks.
JOE: No tricks, no mirrors, nothing up my sleeve. It's on the level this time.
