Unable to connect to PostgreSQL database using schemas I am using QGIS 2.0 with PostgreSQL 10 and PostGIS 2.4.I have multiple users who need to access their vector data from the database. All the users have the same vector layers on their project, but need to create their own features and store them individually on the database, with the user being able to access only his/ her own tables.I created a database user_markings and imported all the relevant vector layers into it using DB Manager. I cloned the public schema of this database using a script into multiple schemas, one for each user. I granted all privileges for a user to his/ her schema, and assigned the user login a path to the schema.When I attempt to connect to the database as one of the users, I get the following error: Erronous query: SELECT postgis_version() returned 7[ERROR: function postgis_version() does not exist].I am able to login as a Superuser. I have double checked the postgis and postgis_topology extensions in my database. Also as I read in one of the posts, I have assigned a path to postgis in the database properties.
