BOND: Revenge isn’t so hard to fathom. What’s clever is getting someone else to pay for it.
RENARD: Not many people in this world have that kind of fortune.
BOND: Who is it?
RENARD: You think I fear death? I welcome it. I get on my knees and pray for it. You, on the other hand, you have something to live for, no? She’s beautiful isn’t she? You should have seen her before. Flawless, and still so innocent, not such a whore in bed...
BOND: You will never touch her. You will never get near her.
RENARD: Have you forgotten who saved your life in Geneva?
BOND: Consider me ungrateful.
RENARD: It’s I who should thank you -- for taking that money back to MI-6. So distressing for M. An explosion inside her lair.
BOND: She’ll get over it.
RENARD: You even brought the plane for us. We really couldn’t have done it without you.
