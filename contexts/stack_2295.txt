Car run out of fuel Project Cars 2 I was playing Project CARS 2 and I ran out of fuel during private testing. All that happened was my car stopped working.Say if I were in an endurance race, such as the Le Mans 24hr, if this were to happen in real life, the car would be towed back to the garage and refueled.Is there anything I can do when I run out of fuel in endurance races apart from quitting or restarting the session?
