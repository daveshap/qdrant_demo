Qualifications Question: applying to PR job w/marketing experience
This is my first time applying for a PR role and I have a few questions, chief among which is what typically counts as relevant experience.

The opening that I’m eyeing is with a municipal utility company. They’re looking for an in-house generalist (community, media, gov’t) with 10 years of experience.  My background is 10 years of marketing and community organizing/political campaigns. There is a lot of overlap between my previous duties and the duties listed in the opening, but I’m not sure how well it would be received as PR experience. I don’t know if the feud between marketing and PR is still a thing, but it definitely was when I was minoring in PR. 

If it is passable as relevant experience, how thoroughly should I address it in the cover letter? I’d like to use that space to go into my industry knowledge -- I have a masters in public policy focusing on energy regulation. Which would you recommend prioritizing?   
 

I’ve put together a portfolio of my writing, which is mostly policy briefings and articles for my undergraduate newspaper. The press releases and media pitches I’ve done are mostly for political causes and I’m weary of including them. Would it be odd to create some samples for evaluation purposes and use those instead?

Thanks in advance for your input!
