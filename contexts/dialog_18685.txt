SKIP: Pretty creepy, huh? Are you totally disgusted?
MUMFORD: Skip, you're a visionary. That can be a burden.
SKIP: This doesn't seem a little... perverse?
MUMFORD: There are a lot of lonely people in the world. Somebody's gonna figure this out someday.
SKIP: It's not going to be me. I'm giving it up.
MUMFORD: Really?
SKIP: It's all your fault. In the last 48 hours, I've completely lost interest.
MUMFORD: What'd I do?
SKIP: Lily.
MUMFORD: Lily... ...Skip, that's great! You and Lily.
SKIP: Oh, she doesn't know about it yet. Right now, of the two of us, I'm the only one in love. But I'm very stoked.
