BETTY: Stop calling us. Leave us alone. Leave us alone. I'll kill you. I'll kill you.
MALCOLM: Betty it's me. It's me.
BETTY: Malcolm, they keep calling, threatening us. I'm going crazy, when is this going to stop?
MALCOLM: Don't answer the phone. It's all right. It's all right. Nothing is gonna happen to anybody.
BETTY: Dear heart, where are you?
MALCOLM: At the Hilton. The girls asleep?
BETTY: I just put them to bed. Can we come to the meeting tomorrow?
MALCOLM: I don't think that's such a good idea.
