SAMI: What?
DANIEL: Can I trust you, Sami?
SAMI: Hey, who warned you that they were coming up to the room?
DANIEL: If they had taken us by surprise they would have gotten the tapes back. That would have left us with nothing.
SAMI: No, that would have left me with nothing because all of you would be dead.
DANIEL: You haven't answered my question.
SAMI: Does it really matter what I say?
DANIEL: I'm leaving you with my friends. I'm trusting you to do the right thing today.
SAMI: I will.
DANIEL: You better.
