Dear OLD users
If someone doesn’t reply immediately here’s a shockingly new idea; they might be busy?!
I know it’s totally mind blowing...

The amount of people who cannot understand that people work in places where phones aren’t allowed, or who need sleep instead of messaging a person they’ve never met astounds me. 

Y’all are grown ass adults. 
Please don’t be that person who gets butthurt because someone hasn’t replied in an hour.

Lots of love,
A VERY frustrated girl who is sick of telling people that work is a thing and I can’t reply instantly.
