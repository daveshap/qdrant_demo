I went to TPE and the lack of follow up has made me a mess
I have anxiety, which has elevated pretty severely during this search. I went to TPE, had excellent interviews, but haven't heard back from most of the institutions. These 3 are the ones I'm most confused by:

School #1: had all interviews at TPE. Got a follow up interview with director last week, went great. They want to schedule flyouts next week, but I haven't heard back. 
School #2: both rounds at TPE. Director sent a thank you note saying the look forward to possibly scheduling a campus visit with me. Since then....nothing
School #3: stayed late to fit into my schedule to have a final interview, said they couldn't wait to have me on campus. Again, nothing since.

What's happening?! I wish this didn't freak me out so badly, but I am so used to being straight-forward and communicative. Anxiety and job hunting do not mix.
