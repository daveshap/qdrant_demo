Ubuntu mounts external ntfs drive as read-only? I am an infrequent Ubuntu / Linux user, only use it in case of major disaster (in this case Ransom-ware nuclear, but that's another story).So i booted up another laptop using Ubuntu from a USB-drive; inserted my external ntfs drive, and it gets recognized automatically, but if i try to create a new folder / drive anywhere, the \"file manager\" interface just closes down, and i have to launch it again (try again, rinse and repeat).This leads me to guess my ext.drive was mounted in read-only mode by default.Q1. How / where can i verify it is mounted in read-only mode?Q2. What's the best way to make it mount in read-write mode?
