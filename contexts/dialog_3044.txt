BARBARA: I'm sorry, Uncle, I came to tuck you in. And...
ALFRED: You came to tuck me in. That's quite a switch. I am looking for my brother, Wilfred. He is first butler to the Maharajah of Mirajanpore. But Mirajanpore is a floating court, it travels across India, so Wilfred can be rather difficult to find.
BARBARA: I guess they don't have fax machines on elephants.
ALFRED: I have been trying to reach Wilfred with no success. As one grows older, one yearns for family.
BARBARA: It's good to see you again, Uncle. I've missed you.
ALFRED: As I've missed you. Sleep well, child.
