Putting Money Onto Your Xbox One Question: How do I put specific funds on my xbox account without using a credit card?I own an Xbox One and right now I'm interested in buying a DLC, but problem is I lack the funds by about \u00a30.05. I know there is no gift card/redeemable code but if there is somesort of code I can use it would be most convenient.Is there anyway I can put exactly \u00a30.05 on my account without using my credit card? I've had previous issues with my credit card online and I don't want to risk it again, and PayPal wouldn't be good either. Thanks.
