ANGIE: Who you gonna call?
MARTY: I was gonna call that girl from last night. Take her to a movie tonight.
ANGIE: Are you kidding?
MARTY: Listen, Angie, I wanna tell you, you were very impolite last night. I introduced you to the girl, you just turned and walked off. Now, why did you do that?
ANGIE: You got me mad, that's why. Hey, Joe, show Marty that picture.
