To What Extent is the CDC Restricted From Studying Gun Violence?
Considering the recent mass shootings, there has been plenty of support for gun control legislation in Congress. One of the things I've been seeing is people angry that the CDC is prevented from conducting research on gun control.  

On one side, I see people talking about how the Dickey Amendment prevents the CDC  from working on this research, and how spending bills don't allocate any budget for this area.

On the other side, I see pro-gun people talking about how the CDC actually is able to conduct gun control research, and has done so.

So where is this disagreement coming from?
