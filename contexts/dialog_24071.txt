CHRISTY: I was thinking Las Vegas. Get some butts in those seats.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: And what next? Popcorn? Curtain calls? This is not a theater. or a casino.
CHRISTY: Exactly. People like going to theaters and casinos. But they think church is for Grandma -- we could change that. Pack the joint.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Through blasphemy? You have corrupted the entire choir!
CHRISTY: Hold on. That's not fair. I worked hard with them. They gave up their free time, and they loved it. Those women are happy. And we can get even better. We can wake this place up.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Out of the question.
CHRISTY: Please let me try. I'm begging you.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: And I am refusing. As of tomorrow, Mary Lazarus will resume her leadership of the choir.
BISHOP O'HARA: Reverend Mother, I just wanted to congratulate you.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Oh?
BISHOP O'HARA: I haven't enjoyed Mass this much in years. What a marvelous program. Innovative. Inspiring. You are to be commended.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Well... thank you.
BISHOP O'HARA: I can't wait until next Sunday, when the choir performs again. Did you see the people walk right in from the street? That music, that heavenly music -- it called to them.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Perhaps.
BISHOP O'HARA: I must tell the Cardinal. I.11 send him a personal letter, describing your efforts, your bold new fight to keep your little convent alive.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Really?
