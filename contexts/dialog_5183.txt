BERGER: Such a bargain. But that is your decision?
LASZLO: I'm sorry. It is.
RENAULT: Monsieur Laszlo, is it not?
LASZLO: Yes.
RENAULT: I am Captain Renault, Prefect of Police.
LASZLO: Yes. What is it you want?
RENAULT: Merely to welcome you to Casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay. It is not often we have so distinguished a visitor.
LASZLO: Thank you. I hope you'll forgive me, Captain, but the present French administration has not always been so cordial. May I present Miss Ilsa Lund?
RENAULT: I was informed you were the most beautiful woman ever to visit Casablanca. That was a gross understatement.
ILSA: You are very kind.
LASZLO: Won't you join us?
