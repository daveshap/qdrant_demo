Is a job in res life really my only way in?
Hi all,

I'll try to make this brief: I have my MA in Higher Education Administration which I pursued after working many student affairs jobs in my undergrad (orientation leader, commuter assistant, program assistant, etc), and during that time I took on a GA in Residential Programming and worked at the Academic Success Center on campus as well. I now work as a Senior Program Coordinator at a College of Continuing Education at a state school campus, and while it's technically a higher ed job, I do admin work for EMS programs and it's not really why I went into the field. I really, really miss being more directly involved with student affairs. I'm trying to get back into the true student affairs game, but it's starting to feel very daunting and that my only way in is to take a res life job, which is not what I really want to do. Does anyone have any success stories that might prove otherwise?
