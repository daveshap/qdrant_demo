VALIANT: How did you get onto Doom?
JESSICA RABBIT: Marvin told me. Doom was after his land. Ne was afraid. That's why he brought me his will.
VALIANT: So where is it?

VALIANT: A joker to the end.
JESSICA RABBIT: Looks like our goose is cooked, our hash is slung, our fait is accompli...
VALIANT: Lemme guess where you got that from. Tell me somethin', what'd you ever see in that guy anyway?
JESSICA RABBIT: He made me laugh.
