NICHOLAS: Who are they?""
CHRISTINE: I don't know, nobody does. I'm an employee.
NICHOLAS: Then, what good are you?
CHRISTINE: I know things... like who you can trust. Like that your brother was in on it from the beginning.
NICHOLAS: That's a lie...
CHRISTINE: Yeah? I was your waitress on your birthday. Connie told you about C.R.S. that day, remember? I was already playing my part, <u>before</u> you started the game.
CHRISTINE: It wasn't his fault. He thought it was his only way back. They fleeced him real good.
NICHOLAS: How? How could they have gotten anything?
CHRISTINE: They did the same to him as they did to you.
NICHOLAS: What are you talking about... ?
