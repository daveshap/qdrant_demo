BOBBY: Need a hand?
SAILOR: Thanks, Bobby, 'bout done.
BOBBY: How 'bout a beer?
SAILOR: That'd be fine, Bobby.
BOBBY: Let's go by Rosarita's. You been there yet?
SAILOR: No, haven't heard of it.
BOBBY: Thought maybe Sparky and Buddy'd taken ya. Come on, I'll drive.
SAILOR: This your car?
BOBBY: Hell, no, belongs to my girl's sister. The sister's been over to New Orleans, lets us have it while she's gone. Where's that pretty little lady of yours today?
SAILOR: Restin' in our room. She ain't been feelin' well.
BOBBY: Sorry to hear it.
SAILOR: New Orleans, huh?... We was just there.
