CHARLOTTE: There's no hurry. It's early.
FLORENCE: I can't convince the inner woman that we can wait. She's howling for a bit of ground beef before we drop in on Santa Claus and the other dummies. I've only had a cup of coffee since last night.
CHARLOTTE: Why didn't you eat last night?
FLORENCE: Ouch! Eat? You can do a solo if you don't step on it. I'm going to bow out on you.
CHARLOTTE: What's the rush? There's no first act. They'll all be there and we don't have to appear at any particular time.
FLORENCE: I'm hungry. I'll eat the first child I see. And I've an appointment with young Winton at 8:30.
CHARLOTTE: You wouldn't get mixed up with that little rotter, would you?
FLORENCE: No? Give me a chance, baby. Money is music in my ears, and when his old man kicks off there'll be a million dollar tune.
CHARLOTTE: If you're going to be indiscreet, I wish you'd be a little more discreet about it. Rich men, like Winton, love you and leave you.
FLORENCE: Yeah, but they leave you plenty.
