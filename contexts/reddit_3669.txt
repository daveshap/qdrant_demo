I think I finally found a girl I with mutual attraction after 36 years on earth
Hey,

I have been single all my life, 36 years old, after years of dating with no real connection, both from online and offline I think I finally found a girl that I like and that also liked me. We felt a mutual connection right from the start and still dating now.  I have just been spending most of my time on interests such as art, business and self-development, etc that I have never felt the need for a relationship.

Just sharing my 2 cents. never give up.
