It seems like my new "friends" don't really care about me.
Just moved to a new state and I'm now enrolled in a new school. I've really been trying to connect with people and make new friends. I've met around 10 people I frequently talk to and consider my "friends". I treat them exactly how I want to be treated. I ask them open-minded questions to ~~share~~ show I care, comment with jokes/complements/advice on everything they tell me. I try my best to make their life easier and be someone they enjoy talking to. They never ask me about my life though. They don't seem to care about what I have to say. It always seems like I have to do all the work to keep the conversation rolling even after 2 months. I mean I really like to hear their stories but sometimes I think: *what about me?*

I've noticed this a lot. Even on reddit. Back in /r/casualconversation I've asked people about their passions, lives, problems and they never had a problem to answer my questions/comments and talk about themselves. Maybe I'm asking for too much. Maybe I should just spend the rest of my life not having the joy of sharing about myself.



Anyways thanks for reading. I have some questions if you'd like to answer.


Why do people like talking about themselves so much? 


How can I be friends with someone who doesn't ask about me?


Have you ever been a friend to someone who barely asked about your life? 


Have you ever thrown yourself out there and got nothing in return?
