VIOLA: A hired player no longer. Fifty pounds, Will, for the poet of true love.
WILL: I am done with theatre. The playhouse is for dreamers. Look where the dream has brought us.
VIOLA: It was we ourselves did that. And for my life to come I would not have it otherwise.
WILL: I have hurt you and I am sorry for it.
VIOLA: If my hurt is to be that you will write no more, then I shall be the sorrier.
VIOLA: The Queen commands a comedy, Will for Twelfth Night.
WILL: A comedy! What will my hero be but the saddest wretch in the kingdom, sick with love?
VIOLA: An excellent beginning Let him be…a duke. And your heroine?
WILL: Sold in marriage and half way to America.
VIOLA: At sea, then--a voyage to a new world?…she lands upon a vast and empty shore. She is brought to the duke…Orsino.
WILL: Orsino…good name
VIOLA: But fearful of her virtue, she comes to him dressed as a boy
WILL: and thus unable to declare her love
VIOLA: But all ends well.
WILL: How does it?
VIOLA: I don't know. It's a mystery
WILL: You will never age for me, nor fade, nor die.
VIOLA: Nor you for me.
WILL: Good bye, my love, a thousand times good bye.
VIOLA: Write me well.
