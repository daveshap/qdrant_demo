ANNE MARIE: My dad was a Navy doctor.
CORBETT: Knew you had no native blood, even with your dark hair. Blue eyes give you away. My wife had blue eyes.
ANNE MARIE: Had?
CORBETT: She's dead.
ANNE MARIE: Oh.
CORBETT: Had some good years. Met her in '66. She showed up one day in Coldfoot. No one knew her. One Sunday morning, she marched into a bar and announced she was available as a wife to the highest bidder. Didn't work out in three months, she'd return the money and leave, no hard feelings. My bid was eight thousand dollars. Beautiful girl.
ANNE MARIE: How did she..?
CORBETT: I was gone, in September, laying traplines. She went to our cache for some meat. Got mauled by a bear. Tore open her skull. -more-
