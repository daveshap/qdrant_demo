Is a Japanese M.A. valid in USA?
I have a question about receiving an M.A. and PhD in a University outside the US.

I'm going to Japan next April for my M.A. in Japanese WW2/military history, and will be doing my Phd after. Will my degree be recognized by US universities when I start looking for PhD programs,  and eventually work as a professor.

Thank you for your time.
