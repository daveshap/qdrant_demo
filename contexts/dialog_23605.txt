LESTER: You look like you've had quite a work-out.
GEORGE: It's nerve wracking sometimes... women can get you very upset.
LESTER: I know it, I know it.
GEORGE: ... this doing hair it's...
LESTER: I know it, son. But tonight's going to be even tougher.
LESTER: George, I know you have to deal with Felicia and you're caught in the middle, and if you can just bear with me tonight, well, I appreciate the way you've handled the situation.
GEORGE: Oh, hey...
LESTER: It's a difficult situation, and I want you to know I appreciate it. Tonight's going to be real tough for me --
GEORGE: I don't know what to...
LESTER: Son, we'll do business, I can tell you that.
LESTER: I'd like a drink.
JACKIE: Just a second, I've gotta clean this mess up or the dogs'll have it all over the house.
LESTER: You ought to get rid of those dogs.
LESTER: They get hair all over the place.
JACKIE: They're Yorkies and they don't shed.
JACKIE: Here.
LESTER: Aren't you going to have one?
JACKIE: No.
LESTER: Why not?
JACKIE: Because I don't want one.
