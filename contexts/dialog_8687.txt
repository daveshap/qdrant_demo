MARY: Thanks. So... do we talk about this... or what?
MIERZWIAK: I don't know what I'm supposed say, Mary. I want to do the right thing here.
MARY: Do you love me? Did you love me? Something. I listened to my tape. I can't believe I've been sitting right in front of it for a year. It's like listening to someone else's story. I mean, I hear myself talking about having sex with you and I can't even imagine you naked. I can't even say naked" to you!"
MIERZWIAK: I have a family, Mary.
MARY: You made me have an abortion.
MIERZWIAK: It was a mutual decision.
MARY: You made me have you erased! I loved you. I love you! How could you --
MIERZWIAK: I didn't make you. You thought it best. But, look, I take full responsibility.
NAOMI: So... you haven't been involved with anyone in all this time?
JOEL: It's been a pretty lonely couple of years.
NAOMI: I'm sorry.
JOEL: Well, it was my fault -- the break- up. I'm sorry.
NAOMI: Oh, sweetie. It really does cut both ways. We were taking each other for granted and --
JOEL: I miss you.
NAOMI: Miss you, too. I have been seeing someone for a little while.
JOEL: Oh! Great. That's great!
NAOMI: A religion instructor at Columbia. A good guy. He's a good guy.
JOEL: I'm sorry. I really shouldn't have --
NAOMI: I'm glad you called.
JOEL: So you think the dissertation will get published?
NAOMI: I don't know. I'm not sure there's a big public demand for books on Calvinism and Misogyny.
CLEMENTINE: So you'll call me, right?
JOEL: Yeah.
CLEMENTINE: When?
JOEL: Tomorrow?
CLEMENTINE: Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines.
JOEL: Yeah.
JOEL: Hi, Naomi, it's Joel.
NAOMI'S VOICE: Hi.
JOEL: How's it going?
NAOMI'S VOICE: Good. I called you at work today. They said you were home sick.
JOEL: I know. I had to take the day to think.
NAOMI'S VOICE: Yeah, I tried you at home. Did you get my message?
JOEL: I just got in.
NAOMI'S VOICE: Long day thinking.
