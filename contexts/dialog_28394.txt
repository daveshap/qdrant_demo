LONNEGAN: All right, Riley. What the hell happened?
RILEY: We missed him.
LONNEGAN: You weren't hired to miss him.
RILEY: There wasn't any way he coulda known we was in there. We made a clean pick on the lock and didn't leave no footprints in the hall. Somebody musta wised him up.
LONNEGAN: Yeh, and what does Cole say about that?
RILEY: I don't know. He took it hard.
LONNEGAN: All right, get outa here. You're outta work.
LONNEGAN: We'll put Salino on it. I need somebody careful.
COMBS: Salino? Why waste our best people on a small-time job like this? It ain't no heavy gee we're after. The guy's a five and dime grifter.
LONNEGAN: Then why ain't he dead?
COMBS: They didn't think he'd be so cagey, that's all. They'll get him next time.
LONNEGAN: Use Salino. It'll take a little longer, but there won't be any holes in it.
LONNEGAN: And tell Cole I wanta see him when he gets in.
COMBS: He's not comin' in. Not to get bounced off a job anyway.
LONNEGAN: He had his chance and all he did was shoot up a rooming house. Made a lotte noise and woke up a few cops, but didn't hit nothin'.
