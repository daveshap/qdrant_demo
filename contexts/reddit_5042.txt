Has anyone else been rejected by the Google hiring committee without any feedback?
I applied at Google for an entry level software engineering role for which I studied my bum off and I went through 3 stages of interviews. 

I recently received an email from my recruiter telling me that the hiring committee decided not to move forward with my candidacy. 

I emailed my recruiter back to thank her and ask if I could receive any feedback on how I could improve but, her response was that she doesn't get any feedback from the hiring committee, only that she gets a recommendation on next steps from the hiring team and that is all. 

I'm left with questions..

1) is it good that I made it all the way to the hiring committee? 

2) Does the fact that I made it to the hiring committee mean that I was recommended by all 3 of my interviewers? I mean I could've simply been rejected at any prior interview..

Has anyone else been through something similar?
