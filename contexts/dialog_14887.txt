JIM: Can you get some sworn statements?
BILL: That's gonna be tough. Nobody's talking.
JIM: I think we should have him in for a little talk.
LIZ: Do you have any evidence against him, Jim? Clay Shaw's done so much for the city with all that restoration in the Quarter. He's well connected, all his friends, the money, people, be careful, Jim.
JIM: It'll be off the record, honey. I'll bring him in on a Sunday. A quiet little chat between gentlemen.
