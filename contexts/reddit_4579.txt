depression is getting worse
this is kind of just rambling but i’ve been depressed for literally as long as i can remember and i cant take it anymore. everyday just feels like a chore to get through. when i meet new people they’re supportive at first but over time they just get annoyed bc it never goes away and they end up leaving, so i’ve just taken to not venting to friends bc it’s only ever made things worse. growing up i was a smart kid and now i’ve failed out of college multiple times and am in extreme debt because of it. i’m stuck living with my parents and all i want is to move out but i can’t hold down a job. i’ve tried every antidepressant available to me as well as multiple kinds of therapy, TMS, partial programs and inpatient. nothing helps. i don’t want to die i just want to be happy but it feels like there’s nowhere to turn. i love life and i love people, the only reason i don’t end everything is because i know how much it would hurt people in my life. i just want to be able to experience happiness and not be so tired everyday and constantly overwhelmed with thoughts of hurting myself. i try so hard every single day to get better and it only gets worse. i’ve called or texted hotlines in the past but it just made me suicidal because it just makes it more obvious there’s nothing that can be done. i think if the coronavirus wasnt going on i’d probably admit myself to inpatient but that doesn’t really seem possible right now. plus when i’ve gone to inpatient in the past they haven’t really helped me, i barely even got therapy they just made sure i didn’t kill myself but didn’t do anything to make those thoughts go away. i’m in so much pain. i don’t know what else to do.
