Putting Databases In Single User Mode I used SSMS to put several databases in Single User Mode.  I started doing a full backup on each database and it was working sucessfully until I got to the 3rd database and I'm receiving an error telling me the database is already open.  I stopped all Agent Jobs before I started and the DB is off the network.  I tried putting the database back in Multi-User mode and I'm being told it's already in use.How do I disconnect whatever is connected to it?  I restarted the SQL Server instance with no luck.
