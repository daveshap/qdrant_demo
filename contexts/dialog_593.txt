EVE: Martha, you have to make a decision on her sanity as quickly as possible and not interfere with due process of law.
MARTHA: No... no, excuse me Eve. As quickly as I see fit.
EVE: The longer you take to make a decision, the more difficult it will be for us.
MARTHA: Why?
EVE: The bishop is breathing down our necks.
MARTHA: And the sooner she goes to prison, the better off she'll be?
LEVEAU: ???
MARTHA: I don't believe this. I don't bloody believe this.
