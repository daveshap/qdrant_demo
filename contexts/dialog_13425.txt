BETSY: I heard you playing.
HOLLAND: I often do.
BETSY: I know what you went through tonight. I kept thinking of what you said: that all good things died here, violently.
HOLLAND: Why did you come in here?
BETSY: I don't know. I wanted to help you. And now that I'm here, I don't know how.
HOLLAND: You have helped me. I want you to know I'm sorry I brought you here. When I thought of a nurse, I thought of someone hard and impersonal.
BETSY: I love Fort Holland.
HOLLAND: What you saw tonight -- two brothers at each other's throat and a woman driven mad by her own husband? Do you love that?
BETSY: You didn't drive her mad.
HOLLAND: Didn't I? I don't know. That's the simple truth of it. I don't know.
