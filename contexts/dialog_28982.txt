LOTHER: We haven't any chips, Mr. Brett--Do you mind playing with cash?
BRETT: Not at all.
BRETT: I'll bet a couple of hundred-- I wonder what's keeping that boy.
SUMMERS: Don't worry about that. We'll settle after the hand. Out in Montana where I come from a man's word is all that's necessary. What have you got?
BRETT: Three Jacks.
SUMMERS: That beats two Pairs. I'm glad <U>I</U> didn't win the first pot. Take the money, Mr. Brett.
BRETT: Well, I'm off to a pretty good start.
LOTHER: If I ever won a pot that large the boat would sink.
