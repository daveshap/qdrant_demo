JERRY: Liza?
LIZA: Did you kill him?
JERRY: Is that what they told you?
LIZA: Did you kill my father?
LIZA: Then why did you have his picture in your safe deposit box?
JERRY: He gave it to me.
LIZA: I don't understand.
JERRY: Where were you the day he died?
LIZA: At a horse show.
JERRY: That's the last time you rode, isn't it? Do you think it was your fault? Is that why?
LIZA: Did you kill my father?!
JERRY: No...! But they trained me to. M.K. ULTRA. EX-CATCHER. America works. Get rid of the crazy people, the lone gunmen, and the system still works.
LIZA: Jerry. Please. You don't understand. I have to know. It's all I think about. Do you have any idea what it's like not to know?
JERRY: Yeah. I know what it's like.
LIZA: Then tell me what happened.
JERRY: Can't give you the details because I can't remember. I went to court to kill him. At the Ezekiel Walters hearing. I was supposed to shoot him at the press conference. You were there. That's the first time I saw you.
LIZA: Love at first sight?
JERRY: I don't know what it was. All I know is I had a gun in my hand, but when I saw you standing with him, I couldn't do it. If that's love, it's not so bad. I found a part of myself that day. I couldn't go back.
LIZA: Back where?
JERRY: To Jonas. I didn't know that at the time. Didn't know who he was. But I knew inside, whoever he was, he'd send someone else. So I started watching your father. I wanted to keep him safe.
LIZA: Someone else might call it stalking. My dad felt it. He started carrying a gun.
JERRY: He kept it in the side table in the front hallway. He showed me. I visited a few times. Then one of Jonas's guys visited. When I arrived, your dad was dying.
LIZA: Why? What do these guys have to do with Ezekiel Walters?
JERRY: Walters was their fall guy. Blow up a building and blame a nut. Create fear. Don't you see? Your father wasn't trying to keep Walters in prison. He was looking into getting him out. He didn't believe the official story.
LIZA: Why not?
LIZA: <u>Why not, Jerry</u>?
JERRY: Because he believed me.
LIZA: How'd you get the picture?
JERRY: Your father, he was dying. He was worried about you. He took your picture out to look at it. He called you his baby.
