Apples use of Lightning connector in MFi Program I am thinking of an accessory as below:Let's assume accessory has battery in it to do certain function, now to charge the battery can we use same iPhone charger lightning port and draw the power from that port?Basically there will be simultaneous charging of accessory battery and iPhone\u2019s battery. Do apple have any restriction on that kind of accessory?Please note, the accessory is not a Power Bank.
