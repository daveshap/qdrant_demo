It's not as bad as other people but still need comfort
Hey guys I'm 11 and I know that's pretty young for me to be on reddit and I know but I really need help my parents are going through a divorce I dont have many freinds I recently figured out I have asthma and me and my sister haven't getting along lately I'm living with my mom and her roomate on a ranch in the country with not many people or kids around for me to hang out with and school is very stressful so if I could get some support that would be very appreciated

Edit:thanks for all the support guys I look at the replys every time I'm doing school to help me I've started going to a therapist and my teachers mom and principal are helping my school go down
