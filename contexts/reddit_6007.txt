Why would a former employer contact your university and request transcripts?
Not sure if this belongs here, but I couldn't find any information on the internet and I'm really baffled. Today I got an email from my university Records Department :

"I was contacted by your previous employer and they are in need of a copy of your transcript.  We can not provide the information as per the FERPA law.  Please forward your unofficial transcript to the following: (old boss's email)"

I haven't worked at this place for over three years, and completely put them out of my mind to be honest. Why would they request my transcript, and would there be any negative consequences if I chose not to comply? Some advice would be helpful.

I work in social services, if that helps.
