BETSY: Mrs. Rand.
MRS. RAND: Wait. Don't draw any conclusions. Let me explain.
BETSY: But, Mrs. Rand --
MRS. RAND: I knew you'd come. And I knew I'd have to come up here and talk to you. I couldn't let you go back without any word. I came to tell you again -- Jessica cannot be cured.
BETSY: But how did you get here? What are you doing here?
MRS. RAND: I asked you to let me explain. It's a long story. And not an easy one --
MRS. RAND: -- and when my husband died I felt helpless. They disobeyed me -- things went from bad to worse. All my husband's dreams of good health, good sanitation, good morals for these sweet and gentle people seemed to die with him. Then, almost accidentally, I discovered the secret of how to deal with them. There was a girl with a baby -- again and again I begged her to boil the drinking water. She never would. Then I told her the god, Shango, would be pleased and kill the evil spirits in the water if she boiled it. She boiled the water from then on.
BETSY: But you didn't have to come up here.
MRS. RAND: Perhaps not. But I did come here and I found it was so simple to let the gods speak through me. Once started, it seemed such an easy way to do good. I should have known there was no easy way to do good, Betsy.
