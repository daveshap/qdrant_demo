HELEN: You want the rest of those numbers, Mr. Dickson?
DICKSON: Numbers? No, never mind.
MATT: What's he doing, honey? Is he getting any help?
HELEN: Something's happened. He isn't trying anymore.
MATT: They must have turned him down.
HELEN: Yes. He called some of the biggest people in town.
MATT: Sure, they'd turn him down. He ought to know that. I'm going in there and talk to him.
MATT: We haven't got much time left, Mr. Dickson. We've got to do something quick or it'll be too late.
DICKSON: Why wouldn't you tell me where you were last night?
MATT: You're not giving up, are you, Mr. Dickson?
DICKSON: Were you in Cluett's apartment?
MATT: Oh, I can explain about that later. You're losing your bank - don't you realize what that means?
DICKSON: Was Mrs. Dickson there?
MATT: Listen, Mr. Dickson, don't let them lick you just because a couple of big shots turned you down. You've got more friends than anybody in this town. Little guys - guys who wouldn't be in business if it weren't for you. All you've got to do is—
DICKSON: Wait a minute. Answer my question. Was Mrs. Dickson there?
MATT: Well . . . uh . . . I . . .
DICKSON: She was, wasn't she? How long has this been going on? Do you know?
MATT: Aw, I don't know what you're talking about. All I know is that you're losing your bank and—
DICKSON: All right. That's all. Please, Matt.
HELEN: Did you talk to him?
MATT: Yeah. I got an idea. Come on, let's get to a telephone.
