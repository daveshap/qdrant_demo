[Poverty Tip] Library = Office Space
As someone who works from home and should really leave the house more often, libraries have been my saving grace. Who can afford to go to a coffee shop each day? It’s like $3 a visit even trying to be cheap.

Library Love:

- The books and media are free. 

- The coffee is a dollar.

- There’s AC and it’s quiet.

- The WiFi is free, fast, and without a time limit.

- The presentations/lectures are actually pretty high quality; one class felt like a $500 value. 

- No one cares what I’m doing, who I am, or why I’m there.

- Some of my local ones are open until 8pm at night.


All I’ve got to say is I love my libraries and they’ve saved me a small fortune in cash and stir crazy mental health. Library Tour 2019!!!
