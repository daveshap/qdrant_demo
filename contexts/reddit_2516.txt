Does anyone else get caught up in what other people see you doing and lose sight of where you see yourself?
Sorry for the long title, but is it just me?? I'm considered a very caring person and so my friend and family are always saying how I should be a nurse or a counselor. And yes, those are great careers-- but, I know that I'd probably get burnout pretty fast, as I sometimes burden myself with the struggles of others. But knowing this (and myself), I still feel like I need to fulfill a role like that to meet my full potential and since I don't think I will, I feel like a failure. Does anyone else deal with this? Any tips on how to separate yourself from these expectations?
