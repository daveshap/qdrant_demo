MARY: Were you going to make a suggestion?
JASON: Yes. I was going to tell you to look into your own heart -- do you really want to find your sister?
MRS. ROMARI: Ah, my Jason -- always laughing -- always trying to help others. He's a good boy, Miss -- he just talks that way.
JASON: I'm a good boy, but no one listens to what I say.
