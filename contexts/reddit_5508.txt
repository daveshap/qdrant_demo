Job title VS education VS work performed.
Hi All,
I've been with this employer for around 10 years and may soon be in the market for a new job.
My problem is, despite not being a degree qualified accountant or CPA, my current employer has given me the title of 'Divisional Accountant'.
Should I change my title on applications to something more generic that reflects my (lack of) qualifications eg. Bookkeeper/Accounts Officer and just let the skills and duties (tax prep, reporting and analysis, reconciliations) indicate the kind of work I've been doing?
Thanks.
