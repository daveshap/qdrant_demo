Cheap/Free Online Licenses/Certifications?
Hi everyone! 

I hope everyone is staying safe and healthy during these hard times. I am currently employed full-time as an academic advisor at a large university and am also currently pursuing an M. Ed in Counseling at the same university. I have been working from home for the past 2 months and although things have been busy, I still find myself with a decent amount of leisure time at night. 

With that being said, I was wondering if anyone on this sub was aware of any online certificate/licenses/courses that I could take on my free time just to gain more knowledge/skills within the scope of higher education. For example, there is a Mental Health First Aid class that I'm interested in taking. I'm not looking for anything in particular, just anything I can do it my free time. Preferably I would want something that I could put on my LinkedIn as proof since I expect to be on the job hunt sometime later this year. 

Thanks for reading! I appreciate any advice I can get.
