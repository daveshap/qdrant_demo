CLAREMONT: I've already formulated a plan.
LATEESHA: What?
CLAREMONT: My armored car business. We just signed a new insurance policy in Nevada. There's a loophole.
LATEESHA: There's always a loophole with you, Claremont. Your black ass is one big loophole. <b> INT. VEGAS SECURITY LOCKDOWN -- [FLASH FORWARD] NIGHT
TARYN: Are you aware that Lateesha Rodriguez has been running a counterfeit driver's license racket?
DOMINO: That's the rumor on the street.
TARYN: What was your business with Lateesha that day?
DOMINO: We needed to verify some bond certificates for Claremont. She pushes stuff through the system for us... helps us track down perps for a kick back. It's all legal. <b> INT. MUSTANG CONVERTIBLE -- [FLASHBACK] DAY </b>
TARYN: <i>You drove Lateesha's daughter to school... then dropped her off at the DMV. Why?</i>
