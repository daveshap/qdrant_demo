My 15 year old brother hung himself and all I want to do is die too...
I just feel so hopeless. So fucking hopeless. Everyday I wake up and think about him and how the possibility of me moving out at 18 caused him to despise me and hate me. I had become increasingly distant weeks before he passed because I was so busy with work, getting a new apartment, etc..and I hate being so mad at myself for not being able to be there. I wish I would have been the one to die instead. I am a bitter and angry person all the time and no matter what I do I just can’t seem to get rid of all this anger and aggression I feel. My boyfriend doesn’t help. Just gets mad at me for being mad. I just want to give up. I haven’t cut for over a year but lately it’s been the only thing to help anything. I just want my brother back. I’ve never thought suicide was so selfish until I lost my best friend and all I want is to see him again. It hurts, a piece of my heart is gone. I just wish I could have been the one to die instead.  I just wish I would have died instead.
