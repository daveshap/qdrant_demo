CARTER: Doctor...without killing him -- how long could we stop his heart?
REID: The less time, the better.
CARTER: I know that. But what's the maximum?
REID: In his comatose state...and everything slowed down...no more than sixty seconds.
CARTER: At topspeed...and adjusting distance for Degree of Miniaturization -- The sub should get through the Heart in fifty-seven seconds.
REID: That would give us only three seconds to revive him...
CARTER: What are the problems in stopping the Heart?
REID: Nothing -- compared to starting it up again.
