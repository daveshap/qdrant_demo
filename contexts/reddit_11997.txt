I can't stop crying
My girlfriend of 3.5 years broke up with me a little over a month ago. I thought I was fine cause after a couple weeks I had stopped being sad for myself. 

But yesterday it all started up again. And now I just can not stop crying  and I don't know why. 

I'm a complete mess. 

I want her back so badly but she's moved on and it wasn't a very healthy relationship. But I was happy with her. 

I know I'll feel better eventually but it doesn't feel like it right now. Things I used to enjoy no longer entertain me at all. It just feels like I'm trying to rip off a bandaid that's super glued to my skin. 

I'm reconnecting with old friends but that's not really what I need right now. I just want to move and and stop being sad.
