Onboarding email from company that asks for PII without job offer?
The email says " We are pleased to inform that you’ll be confirmed as Tableau Consultant once you provide the following details"

 

1. Copy of your work authorization document (EAD, GC, US passport etc.)
2.  Copy of your Driver’s License or ID 
3.  Copy of your Degree Diploma and/or transcript – min. bachelor’s degree is required
4. Copy of your passport (if your visa status is F1) 
5. Copy of your SSN  

I gave the recruiter a call and told her I don't feel comfortable giving information over email and she says I am welcome to come into their office and hand over the documents.

My question is, what company would ask you for this information without a formal job offer first? Should I call her back and ask for a job offer first? Could this be a scam?
