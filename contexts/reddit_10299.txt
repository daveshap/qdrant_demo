I don’t want to get “help”
No I don’t want to get better. In fact I want to get worse. I want to get so bad that I have no choice but to kill myself. Why would I want to get better if I want to die? Getting “better” will only slightly decrease my depression to the point where I still feel like shit but not enough to want to die and I’m sorry but that’s the opposite of what I want. I don’t want to dish out a ridiculous amount of money for someone to convince me that I should keep living this ridiculously expensive and worthless life for another few decades. Death is the only way to free myself from all the problems in my life. Medication and therapy might minimize it but it’ll never truly go away. The longer I’m alive the more problems will pop up and ending it right now is the only reasonable thing for me to do.
