Why did the Oracle encourage Neo to save Zion instead of Trinity? In The Matrix Reloaded, the Oracle encourages Neo to save Zion instead of saving Trinity. Assuming the Oracle truthfully wanted to help humanity, then why didn't she encourage him to save his love (Trinity) and not choose the door that leads him to rebooting the Matrix (saving Zion/humanity), but instead encourage him to go to the Machine City and talk to the Deus Ex Machina (as happens in the following film).
