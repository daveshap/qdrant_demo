JOHN: That's good. Cools you right off. I saw you watching me.
GRACE: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.
JOHN: I didn't say it bothered me.
GRACE: Did you like it; me watching you?
JOHN: I guess. I've got an ego same as any man.
GRACE: Good, 'cause I liked what I saw.
JOHN: Nice place you got here.
GRACE: Thank you.
JOHN: Must get kind of lonely for a woman living by herself in a big house.
GRACE: I guess it must.
JOHN: What do you do anyway?
GRACE: A little of this, a little of that. Mostly I tell fortunes.
JOHN: Where'd you learn to do that?
GRACE: From my father. He was the tribe's Shaman.
JOHN: A medicine man?
GRACE: Those are white words, not ours.
JOHN: Nice house for a Shaman's daughter. You must be good.
GRACE: Come here.
