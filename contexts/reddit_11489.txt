I have a foreskin.
I know it's the natural way to be, but still. I'm 14 and live in Ontario, where it's about 50/50. I guess that's an okay percentage, but I feel so alone. I'm still a virgin, but after browsing countless forums and questionnaires, I'm afraid that when it does finally come out, I'm going to be rejected. Girls in this day and age, especially teenagers, are raised in the western culture of circumcised penises being the norm. I remember bringing up foreskins once with some friends, and they all said "That's fucking disgusting." My mates who still have theres all describe them as short and not even noticeable when hard, whereas mines so long it can't even be pulled back all the way. I feel like such a freak and it's honestly discouraged me from even trying to get a girlfriend, because I'm scared of rejection. I'm in the minority here, but I honestly wish I'd been cut when I was born. I'd be a lot happier today.
