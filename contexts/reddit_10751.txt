Did you ever realize?
That nobody in your life actually gives a fuck about you? Not one person genuinely cares or makes an effort of any way towards your relationship or friendship? That while youâ€™re sure they would cry if you killed yourself, they would soon get over it and move on, because despite the love and connection you feel towards them, nobody feels that way towards you? Despite the lengths you would go for anybody and everybody at all, nobody would so much as cross a shallow puddle to make you feel welcomed on this earth. 

Cause yeah folks, that sucks.
