ANDREWS: Mr. Warne?
PETER: Yeah.
ANDREWS: Come in. Sit down.
ANDREWS: I was surprised to get your note. My daughter hadn't told me anything about you. About your helping her.
PETER: That's typical of your daughter. Takes those things for granted. Why does she think I lugged her all the way from Miami— for the love of it?
ANDREWS: Please understand me. When I say she didn't tell me anything about it, I mean not until a little while ago. She thinks you're entitled to anything you can get.
PETER: Oh, she does, huh? Isn't that sweet of her! You don't , I suppose.
ANDREWS: don't know. I'd have to see on what you base your claim. I presume you feel you're justified in—
PETER: If I didn't I wouldn't be here! I've got it all itemized.
PETER: I sold some drawers and socks, too; I'm throwing those in.
ANDREWS: And this is what you want—thirty- nine dollars and sixty cents?
PETER: Why not? I'm not charging you for the time I wasted.
ANDREWS: Yes, I know—but—
PETER: What's the matter? Isn't it cheap enough? A trip like that would cost you a thousand dollars!
ANDREWS: Let me get this straight. You want this thirty-nine sixty in addition to the ten thousand dollars?
PETER: What ten thousand?
ANDREWS: The reward.
PETER: Who said anything about a reward!
ANDREWS: I'm afraid I'm a little confused. You see, I assumed you were coming here for—
PETER: All I want is thirty-nine sixty. If you'll give me a check I'll get out of this place. It gives me the jitters.
ANDREWS: You're a peculiar chap.
PETER: We'll go into that some other time.
ANDREWS: The average man would go after the reward. All you seem to—
PETER: Listen, did anybody ever make a sucker out of you? This is a matter of principle. Something you probably wouldn't understand. When somebody takes me for a buggy ride I don't like the idea of having to pay for the privilege.
ANDREWS: You were taken for a buggy ride?
PETER: Yeah—with all the trimmings. Now, how about the check. Do I get it?
