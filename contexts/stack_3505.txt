Security of emails from ProtonMail to Gmail I understand that Gmail to Gmail is not very secure. On the other hand, ProtonMail is a very good option with great features. But there is one thing I don't quite understand: Why should I use ProtonMail if the recipient uses Gmail? How is this more secure? I mean, if Gmail is not secure enough, then what's the point of sending an email to Gmail from ProtonMail instead of just keep using Gmail (given that it has extra features)?
