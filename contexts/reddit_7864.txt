Thesis Topic Help
I’m the only one in my program doing research for the thesis. 7th student to do it 15 years. Thus, it’s a feat. 

I am struggling with narrowing down a topic. I want to focus on first gen college student experiences around retention or career development but committee needs me to be specific, such as race? gender? of ideal participant. I’m also toying with doing something about COVID19 too but my data collection isn’t until Fall 2020 and it’s unpredictable. My background is in Residence Life and could send a survey to students? Or professional staff? 

Part of this is venting but also an inquiry for help because I’m stuck. 

Thank you!
