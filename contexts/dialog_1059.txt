ADDISON: Your name is not Eve Harrington. It is Gertrude Slescynski.
EVE: What of it?
ADDISON: It is true that your parents were poor. They still are. And they would like to know how you are - and where. They haven't heard from you for three years...
EVE: What of it?
ADDISON: A matter of opinion. Granted. It is also true that you worked in a brewery. But life in the brewery was apparently not as dull as you pictured it. As a matter of fact, it got less and less dull - until you boss's wife had your boss followed by detectives!
EVE: She never proved anything, not a thing!
ADDISON: But the $500 you got to get out of town brought you straight to New York - didn't it?
