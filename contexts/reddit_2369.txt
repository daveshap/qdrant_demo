If I don’t get into Stanford,
I’ll still attend Stanford. Fuck you, Stanford. Who are you to reject me? You don’t get to decide whether I can attend you or not; I get to. 

I’ll evaluate Pros and Cons of you compared to Harvard, MIT, Wharton, and Cornell, and probably attend you. But don’t think that you already have me. You still can get rejected.
