Which is smarter - take a bird in the hand job even if not ideal or wait? Need to decide today.
If you'd been unemployed a few weeks and were offered a role a couple rungs down from your previous one, 25% lower salary - and had no other roles lined up (although a lot of interviews) would you take it or wait? Financially I can hold out a little bit but my concern is the unknown of whether I'll be offered a role I'm more excited about and/ or one that pays more. How do you know you can afford to punt on the unknown in a job search?
