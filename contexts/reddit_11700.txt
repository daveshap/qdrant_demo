People don't seem to care about the plane that was shot down
I'm at work and the 225 casualties are all I can think about. My heart is breaking for their friends and families and it just seems so unfair. Meanwhile, everyone at work hasn't given it a second thought and is just carrying on as if the tragedy hasn't happened. Even when I try talking to my SO, friends and family about how upset I'm feeling, they seem to think I'm crazy for crying and feeling so sad about these lives that have been lost.
