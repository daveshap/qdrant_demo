VOICE: The great Bill Parrish at a loss for words? The man from whose lips fall 'rapture' and 'passion' and 'obses- sion'...all those admonitions about being 'deliberately happy', what there is no sense 'living your life without...', all the sparks and energy you give off, the rosy advice you dispense in round, pear-shaped tones --
PARRISH: What the hell is this? Who are you?
VOICE: Just think of millenniums multiplied by aeons compounded by infinity, I've been around that long, but it's only recently that your affairs here have piqued my interest. Call it boredom, the natural curiosity of me, the most lasting and significant element in existence has come to see you.
PARRISH: About what?
VOICE: I want to have a look around before I take you.
PARRISH: 'Take me'...? Where?
VOICE: It requires competence, wisdom, experience -- all those things they say about you in testimonials -- and you're the one.
PARRISH: 'The one' to do what?
VOICE: Show me around. Be my guide. And in return, you get...
PARRISH: Get what?
VOICE: Time.
PARRISH: What the hell are you talking about?
VOICE: Watch it!
PARRISH: I'm sorry --
VOICE: In return you'll receive minuets, days, weeks, I'm not going to go into details ... what matters is that I stay interested.
PARRISH: Yes what?
VOICE: 'Yes' is the answer to your ques- tion.
PARRISH: What question?
VOICE: Bill. Come on. The question. The question you've been asking yourself with increased regularity, at odd moments, panting through the extra game of handball, when you ran for the plane in Delhi, when you sat up in bed last night and hit the floor in the office this morning. The question that is in the back of your throat, choking the blood to your brain, ringing in the ears over and over as you put it to yourself --
PARRISH: The 'question' --
VOICE: Yes, Bill. The question.
