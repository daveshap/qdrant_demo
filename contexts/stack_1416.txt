Tesla Coil Troubleshooting Help! A couple weeks ago I decided to build a tesla coil and after a decent amount of research and building time the coil could only light up a light bulb. I have tried many things to fix it but all to no avail. Some issues I think it might have is too small of a capacitor and not enough windings on the primary coil. I made leyden jar capacitors and a bucket capacitor, which had a total capacitance of 20 nanofarads (which seems awfully small compared to all the tutorials I followed). Additionally, I only had enough copper tubing to make the primary 6 turns. Anyways, here are some of the coils details:700 secondary turns, two microwave oven transformers in series, toroid is 15\" by 4\and a static spark gap.If anyone could help me with the problems I would be very appreciative. Thank you guys!Edit: Accordingly, my question was unclear so bear with me because I am new to this community. I am asking how to optimize the power output of my Tesla coil because it currently cannot produce actual sparks. I described the set-up to the best of my ability but if there are any other specs that would actually change the performance than please let me know so i can give those as well. I hope that this feed can help others that are new to Tesla coil design as well because I feel that the optimization and tuning is a common mistake beginners make. Anyways after adding 6 more turns to the primary and testing 5 points per turn the sparks still have not been made. Perhaps this is because of the 4400 volts from the MOTs rather over 10,000 volts that some NSTs can supply.
