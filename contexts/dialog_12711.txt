UNCLE JOE: Aren't you getting a little old for this? You flunked out of law school.
BRENNA: Now there's a new topic.
UNCLE JOE: Don't they have enough for you to do at the castle?
UNCLE JOE: Forgers do it all the time. They take the birth certificate of some- one who died young and use it to get legit I.D. Usually they carry it long enough to pass some bad checks then dump it.
BRENNA: Thanks.
UNCLE JOE: Call your mother. You never call her.
