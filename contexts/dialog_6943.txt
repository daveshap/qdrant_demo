AMY: It's you...Irena...my friend!
IRENA: Don't cry, Amy.
AMY: She's dead! I know what it is now when people say somebody died. I know what they mean! And I'm afraid. She's dead; she's dead!
IRENA: You mustn't be afraid.
AMY: But she's dead!
IRENA: Amy, listen to me. Death isn't such a terrible thing.
AMY: Oh, it is, it is! Death's terrible.
IRENA: But, Amy! Amy...I'm dead.
AMY: You?
IRENA: Yes, Amy.
AMY: But why?
IRENA: Death's like life. Death's a part of life. It isn't frightening. It isn't the end of everything. It isn't quiet and nothingness. It's a part of all eternity.
