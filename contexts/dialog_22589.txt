CARTER: You got a boy friend in here yet? Å’Cause you're gonna need somebody to kiss your ass goodbye.
LAFONTAINE: What are you talking about?
CARTER: You're movin' to death row. See, your fingerprints are now on the murder weapon of Four FBI Agents. And when I turn this into the lab, they're gonna find Lafontaine all over it. And we already know... ...this is your MO.
LAFONTAINE: How did I do this?! Maybe you didn't notice but I'm in jail!
CARTER: All I gotta do is implicate. The Feds can do a lot with a good implication. Even if you don't get Sparky, I'll bet you get ten to twenty more. Plenty of time to find a nice fella.
LAFONTAINE: You sonuvabitch.
CARTER: I'm waitin' here for a name.
