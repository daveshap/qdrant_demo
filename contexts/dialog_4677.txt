MARIE: Okay, so...
BOURNE: Thanks for the ride.
MARIE: Anytime.
BOURNE: Look, I don't know what's up there.
MARIE: You got me pretty fucking curious.
BOURNE: Look, you could come up. Or you could wait if you want. I could go check it out. You could wait.
MARIE: Nah... With you, I mean, you'd probably just forget about me, right?
BOURNE: How could I forget about you? You're the only person I know.
