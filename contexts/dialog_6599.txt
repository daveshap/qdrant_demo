MICHAEL: Exactly.
LETTY: We'll get caught.
MICHAEL: No rounds for another three hours.
MICHAEL: Nervous? Scared? Worried you're not fit for a caper of epic proportions?
LETTY: Don't be ridiculous.
MICHAEL: Rendezvous at the closet in 30.
NURSE GATES: Letty, you should be in bed.
LETTY: There's a spider in my room.
NURSE GATES: Yeah?
LETTY: It's got a green dot on its back. I can't go to sleep with it watching me.
NURSE GATES: Sounds awful. I guess we better check it out.
