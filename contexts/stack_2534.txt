Iterate over GEE assets in Python script and mixing local and server side objects I have below two questions that are related together:1- Can I iterate over items in my GEE assets in Python script? If yes, how?2- My understanding is that all the images and features (and their collections) are server side objects and I can not define an image based on a local file on my computer and then for example clip a Landsat image in GEE repository with it, am I right?
