GUINAN: It took a long time, but eventually I learned to live with it. And I began to realize that my experience in the Nexus had changed me. I knew things about people, about events, about time.
PICARD: Your sixth sense"- I've always wondered where it came from. And what about Soran?"
GUINAN: Soran may still be obsessed with getting back. And if he is, he'll do anything to find that doorway again.
PICARD: But why destroy a star? Thank you, Guinan.
