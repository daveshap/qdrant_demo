Certifiably Good Online Coding Classes?
I’m a university student graduating undergrad in a couple weeks and going straight into a masters program in the fall. My summer plans have fallen through, and I doubt I will find new ones. Are there any online coding classes you all would recommend? As per other advice on this page, I am hoping to build up skills for future job-search post MPH. I found a lot of online sources, but I’m not sure what is accredited or what a recruiter/potential employer will view as legitimate. Looking for low-cost options that are more flexible than taking a class at my university, as I will need to get some type of temporary job or gig to keep myself afloat for a while.
