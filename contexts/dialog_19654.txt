PORTER: Here, please...
NINOTCHKA: What do you want?
PORTER: May I have your bags, madame?
NINOTCHKA: Why?
KOPALSKI: He is a porter. He wants to carry them.
NINOTCHKA: Why?... Why should you carry other people's bags?
PORTER: Well... that's my business, madame.
NINOTCHKA: That's no business... that's a social injustice.
PORTER: That depends on the tip.
KOPALSKI: Allow me, Comrade.
NINOTCHKA: No, thank you.
BULJANOFF: How are things in Moscow?
NINOTCHKA: Very good. The last mass trials were a great success. There are going to be fewer but better Russians.
NINOTCHKA: What's that?
KOPALSKI: It's a hat, Comrade, a woman's hat.
