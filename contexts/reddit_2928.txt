Is it worth going back to school for a completely different career path?
Hi all, I'm a 25 female who currently has a bachelors in marketing. I've been working this career path for about three years now in traditional and digital marketing - I hate it. I want to do something more full-filling but I can't figure out what that is yet.

Part of my REALLY wants to do nursing but I struggle with emetophobia. Part of me also wants to go for psychology but I would have to get a graduate/doctorate to do most things (I think). 

So, is it really worth it to go back to school and accrue more debt to completely change your career path? And if it is, how do you pick the right choice this time?
