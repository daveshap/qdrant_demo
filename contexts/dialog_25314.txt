LA FORGE: I took these out of Data's neural net... they contain memory engrams...
PICARD: Do you know how they were damaged?
LA FORGE: By a Son'a weapon. There's no doubt about it, sir. That's what made Data malfunction.
PICARD: The Son'a reports claim they didn't fire until after he malfunctioned.
LA FORGE: I don't believe it happened that way.
PICARD: Why would they fire at him without provocation?
LA FORGE: All I know is that he was functioning normally until he was shot. Then, his fail-safe system was activated...
PICARD: Fail-safe?
LA FORGE: His ethical and moral subroutines took over all of his basic functions...
PICARD: So, you're saying he still knew the difference between right and wrong.
LA FORGE: In a sense, that's all he knew. The system is designed to protect him against anyone who might try to take advantage of his memory loss.
PICARD: And yet he attacked us. And told the Ba'ku we were a threat...
PICARD: Implants bothering you?
LA FORGE: It's nothing. I'm just tired.
PICARD: Hello, Data...
DATA: Captain, Geordi...?
PICARD: You're aboard the Enterprise.
