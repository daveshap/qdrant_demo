UK Refugee Blue Travel document holder. Why can't I travel to Italy anymore? I'm a UK Refugee Blue Travel document holder. Why can't I travel to Italy anymore?Today they denied me boarding on the plane. I do not know why and how to complain. I paid for my tickets and no one told me about it, even Ryanair, with which I travelled before without any problems.Any help is appreciated.
