SARAH: Oh shit. Hello? Director's office.
ROMAN: Sarah, it's Roman, I'm sorry I'm running late, I'm still on the 405, I'm about 10 minutes away.
SARAH: Oh it's no problem, I'm just... looking at your music video awards.
ROMAN: All right, since I got you on the phone, let's talk about your character.
SARAH: What character? I'm Candy, the chick who gets killed second. I'm only in two scenes!
ROMAN: You're not happy with your part.
SARAH: I'm not happy that I'm 35 playing a 21 year old. I'm not happy that I have to die naked! And I'm not happy that my character is too stupid not to have a gun in the house after her boyfriend's been cut into McNuggets.
ROMAN: Um hmm... umhmm great, so let's run the lines.
SARAH: Huh, fine.
ROMAN: Page 22, Candy's big moment.
SARAH: Page 22.. Ring ring. Hello?
ROMAN: Hello.
SARAH: Who's this?
ROMAN: Who's this?
SARAH: This is Candy. Hang on, let me get some clothes. See! I don't' understand why I have to start the scene in the shower! The whole shower things been done, 'Vertigo' hello! And I mean, my boyfriend just died, why am I showering?
ROMAN: Why don't we just read the scene? Candy, is that like candy cane or candy apple?
SARAH: Whatever. Come on, who is this? I think you have the wrong number.
ROMAN: But you know my favorite name?
SARAH: I'm hanging up right now.
ROMAN: It's Sarah.
SARAH: Roman that's not the line.
ROMAN: It is in my script.
SARAH: Has there been another goddamn rewrite? How the fuck are we supposed to learn our lines when there's a new script every 15 minutes?
ROMAN: It's not just a new script, it's a new movie.
SARAH: What? What movie?
ROMAN: My movie.
