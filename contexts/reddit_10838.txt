Don't take the pills... It hurts
So I don't think this will stop people from ending their but maybe it will make someone rethink it. Today I tried to overdosed on 1000mg of antidepressants, at about 8:30pm I took ten pills and waited.

Now obviously, I didn't die. But it feels like I am. After about an hour I got dozy, had a hard time keeping my head up and stuff. I wasn't scared, I wasn't sad I was just so groggy. Ten minutes after that my stomach began to ache.

For half an hour I threw up stomach acid violently. I felt like I was going to pass out, so I went to my room to lay down, hell I should've gone to a hospital. The dizziness got worse and I was gagging constantly. I couldnt lay down without hurting, I couldnt sit up without falling down and standing up out of the question. Even now, almost four hours later my body is in small spasms and I'm having a hard time just typing because my body is shaking uncontrollably.

My head still hurts and I cant focus on much, Im exhausted and I cant sleep. This isnt fun, I wish that I didnt do this honestly. I wish I didnt try like this. So if you read this and youre thinking of ending your life with pills, just give it a second thought because its not a painless death.
