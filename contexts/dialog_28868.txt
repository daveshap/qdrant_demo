LILY: <u>This</u> <u>woman</u> <u>has</u> <u>more</u> <u>than</u> <u>jewelry</u>.
GASTON: Ah!
LILY: Did you ever take a good look at her--uh--
GASTON: Certainly!
LILY: They're all right, aren't they?
GASTON: Beautiful. And what of it? Let me tell you something: so far as I'm concerned, her whole sex appeal is in that safe!
LILY: Gaston. Let's open it--right now! Let's get away from here! I don't like this place!
GASTON: Oh, no, darling. There's <u>more</u> sex appeal coming on the first of the month. It's only ten days ... Eight hundred and fifty thousand francs.
LILY: Darling, remember you're Gaston Monescu. You're a crook. I want you as a crook. I love you as a crook. I worship you as a crook. Steal, swindle, rob--but don't become one of those useless, good-for-nothing gigolos!
