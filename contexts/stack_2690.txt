Create Custom function to update virtual attribute of point from raster in QGIS? I am trying to dynamically update the elevation value of a point based on its location when the user tries to move it in edit mode and after saving it in QGIS. I got a point shapefile and DTM (.asc) raster file.I want to create a custom function which could be added to the expression of the virtual attribute of the point shapefile.
