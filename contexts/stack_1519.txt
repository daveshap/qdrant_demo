Calculate battery duration Maybe this is a trivial question, but I am struggling with it for a while.I have an alkaline AA battery which is consuming 80mA for 8 seconds each 30 minutes. I need to calculate how many days it will last before reaching 1.1v. I know it depends a lot on the battery type, but let's say it is a Duracell battery.I have problems in calculating the \"average\" consumption per hour, as the battery is drained for just 8 seconds (80mA) each 30 minutes.Thanks for any help.
