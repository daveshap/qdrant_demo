ADAM: There's nothing we can do. It's just a matter of time before they unlock this room. There goes my model. There goes our last refuge.
BARBARA: We're not going to wait here like cornered animals. I can tell you that. We need help. I'm going to talk to that little girl.
ADAM: What about this Beetle guy?
BARBARA: We don't know who he is... ... I'm going to talk to that little girl.
ADAM: Are you crazy? She can't hear you.
BARBARA: I don't know... what are you looking up?
ADAM: We need some help. I found something this morning. Here. Emergencies. 'In case of emergency, draw door.'
BARBARA: Draw door? I don't know why we keep looking in that stupid book.
