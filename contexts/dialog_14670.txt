CARLA: I could use a half-dozen more arms ...I've only got two weeks to get this thing finished....
ELLEN: Do you and Michael ever talk about his work...? About spending so much time working in the water?
CARLA: Usually it's all he talks about...You mustn't worry....
ELLEN: I can't help it....
CARLA: I used to worry...But you know what happens, you find out that scuba diving's safer than climbing into the bathtub....
ELLEN: I shouldn't interfere... My mother-in-law is so neat she puts paper under the cuckoo clock....
CARLA: Henny Youngman....
ELLEN: You caught me....
CARLA: You're not interfering, Ellen....
