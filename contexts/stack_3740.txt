Covariance versus correlation: which is a \"deeper\" or more \"structural\" property of the data? It might seem obvious that the covariance is a \"deeper\" property of the data generation process (DGP), since normally the specification of a joint distribution is done in terms of its mean vector and covariance matrix. From these, the correlation structure can be deduced. In fact a correlation is mathematically defined as a function of the mean and covariance.However, it is also possible to define a multivariate DGP in terms of means and correlations. In fact, correlations are interesting enough in that they are bounded between -1 and 1 and are comparable. Thus, it is possible to see them somewhat as a more \"structural\" property of the data. Is covariance, ontologically speaking (if this is possible in statistics), a more structural parameter than correlation? Or are maybe both equally structural?
