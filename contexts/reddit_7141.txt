Recruiter called about role @ "stealth mode" startup??
I looked up what stealth mode means (an industry argot that defines a business operating in secret to avoid potential competitors), **but what does this really imply??** It's a startup. Anyone have experiences with this?

My previous job was also at a startup and long story short, I did not have a good time there... So kinda concerning, BUT at the same time, it's a temporary job so perhaps I don't need to worry too much.

I read that it might mean there will be low pay, but the recruiter at the temp agency told me it'll be $20-22, which is reasonable for an entry-level accounting role in silicon valley. However, interesting that a recruiter would give me estimate right off the bat? I don't have much experience with recruiters.
