Why are ''I'm gonna live''-announcements allowed here?
This post is not meant to target anyone in specific, I see this really often in this subreddit, and it just got me so upset. People who come to announce here ''fuck depression, I have decided to live'' or ''I'm leaving this subreddit because I'm better now'' get the most karma and thus, visibility, although here are posts HOURLY about how someone's gonna do it, or needs someone to talk with. Who am I to say about who needs more attention, but in my opinion, it's the people who are struggling.  
Also, maybe it's just me, but these ''positive'' posts make me wanna kill myself even more. This makes me sound like a bitter piece of shit, and maybe I am just that. These ''uplifting'' posts are probably meant to be motivating and so on, but I just can't see or feel it. So please don't get me wrong, I wish everyone could live without suicidal thoughts, I wish everyone well, I wish no one felt the need to be in this subreddit. It's just really, really hard to feel happy for those who ''just decided to live'', when I've been fighting my suicidal thoughts over half of my life, and know it's not gonna get better before I'm finally dead.  
I'm sorry if I got anyone upset with this, that wasn't my intention. I wish I could die already, and not be such a whiny nuisance.
