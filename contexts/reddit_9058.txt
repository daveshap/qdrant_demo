What are the benefits and drawbacks of US Drug Policy?
In general, this refers to the policy of [trying to reduce drug use through making substances harder to access.](https://www.vox.com/cards/war-on-drugs-marijuana-cocaine-heroin-meth/war-on-drugs-success-failure-working)

This means [increasing funding for local law enforcement departments and banning the use of drugs recreationally. Also, the USFG works closely with other countries to try and crack down on the drug trade internationally.](https://www.vox.com/cards/war-on-drugs-marijuana-cocaine-heroin-meth/war-on-drugs-enforcement-america)

**Questions:**

* What are the benefits to the US Government? How does this affect law enforcement within the country?
* How has this affected foreign countries and their respective security? \(Colombia, El Salvador, Etc\)
* What \(if any\) are the external, non\-security benefits/risks that come out of this policy? \(For example: How does this affect flows of foreign direct investment?\)
