Can a website use my debit card details for further transaction? I bought a bracelet from Buzz Bargain(Sorry for advertisement) and it deducts 2.99 from my account and then they send me an email saying that we will deduct 49.9 USD after a month for a subscription to which I didn't subscribe. Now they ain't replying me. So I want to ask will they deduct me that 49.9 USD without my permission? If yes, what am I supposed to do now?
