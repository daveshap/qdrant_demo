At this point, because of Dr. Murphyâ€™s evaluation last year and the symptoms exactly the same, I think this is noncardiac. My intonation is that this is reflux. I am going have her double her Aciphex or increase it to b.i.d., and I am going to have her see Dr. XYZ for possible EGD if he thinks that would be appropriate. She is to let me know if her symptoms are getting worse or if she is having any severe episodes.,2. Stomach pain, uncertain at this point, but I feel like this is probably related as well to chest pain.,3. Suspicious lesions on the left shoulder. We will do a punch biopsy and set her up for an appointment for that.,4. Tinea versicolor in the axillary area. I have prescribed selenium sulfide lotion to apply 10 minutes a day for seven days.,5.
