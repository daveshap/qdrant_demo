"You don't need therapy every week, it's not like you were abused"
My mom can straight up go fuck herself. She's the most ignorant, narcissistic piece of scum I've ever known. All she cares about is how much money she'll have for herself for retirement than my declining mental health. No, I may not have been physically abused but I sure as fuck was mentally abused, and she's still abusing me to this day.

She doesn't wanna help pay for my therapy every week so fuck her, I'll pay for my own therapy with what little money I have until I go broke because at least I'll be on the road to getting better. Every time I've tried to have a calm conversation with her about my therapy she'll immediately start yelling and insulting me, and she'll make my depression out to be nothing more serious than just a little boo boo.

She's another classic case of a family member who doesn't understand how serious a person's mental health is until it's too late. If I killed myself, then she'd understand just how fucking serious my mental illness is. It makes me so mad knowing that that's the only way she'll get it. And even then she'll make it all about herself and say something like "I wish I could've been there for her more". She can go eat shit.
