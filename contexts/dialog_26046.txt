MAX: You alright? Y'okay?
LENNY: Yeah. No, not really.
MAX: Let's work it.
LENNY: Not now... I don't want to think about it--
MAX: Come on, Lenny. You used to be good at this stuff. Play it down. What's the perp doing?
LENNY: He stalks her. He rapes her. Then he does her...
MAX: And he records it. Thrill kill. Wants to see it again. And again.
LENNY: He records himself raping and killing her--
MAX: But at the same time he's sending the signal to her--
LENNY: So she feels... what he feels... while he's in her. The thrill while he's killing her... is sent to her, heightening her fear... which in turn heightens the turn on for him. I've seen a lot, Max.
MAX: So've I. Too much.
LENNY: But this is a bad one.
MAX: Top ten.
LENNY: He makes her see her own death, feeds off the reaction... killer and victim merging... orgasm and agony merging. And he records it all.
MACE: And gives it to you.
LENNY: Wants to share.
MAX: That's right. He wants to share. Needs an audience. This is one sick puppy.
LENNY: Why me?
MACE: Cause you're the man, right? The Magic Man. If it's got something to do with the wire, sooner or later it washes up on your beach.
LENNY: I've never dealt in black-jacks. Never. Everybody knows that.
MAX: He's skull-fucking you, bud. Trying to get a reaction. Maybe pushing you to do something.
MACE: Maybe he just figures Lenny will appreciate what he's created. It's the dark end of the street, Lenny. How do you like it now?
LENNY: Jesus, Mace. Back off.
MACE: This guy is someone you know, one of your squid-head contacts.
MAX: Problem is, Lenny knows everybody.
MACE: Take the tape to the cops.
LENNY: Uh unh. No way! They'd crucify me.
MACE: So some psycho wire-freak gets to keep running around--
