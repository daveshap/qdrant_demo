LARA: You no longer can serve humanity if you invest your time and emotion in one of them at the expense of the rest. Surely this is not how you repay their gratitude, Kal-El. Could you really abandon the weak and the needy merely to fulfill some selfish dream.
SUPERMAN: Selfish! But they get a chance at happiness. Can't I have that chance?
LARA: You have been given a higher form of happiness. The happiness you feel by serving others, by inspiring them to --
SUPERMAN: Yes, but it's not all I feel.
LARA: Patience, Kal-El. You begin to sound like an Earthling. SUPERMAN Mother, you speak only of honor, of sacrifice, of responsibility --
LARA: Because that is your heritage. Those are the values we lived by on Krypton.
SUPERMAN: But you had more than that, and I know it. You and my father -- you had each other. Can I never have what you had?
LARA: And she -- the one you have chosen -- she feels as much for you?
SUPERMAN: Yes.
