Should searching for a job be this hard?
I've been applying at almost every place in my city for a few years now, and I only got 2 calls and still haven't been hired. I've been applying in person, online and through connections. I have no experience but a willingness to learn, plus I took training in first aid and I'm working with an employment assistance place to make training easier on the employer.

Places are opening up but they're looking either for people who already have 2+ years experience in any field, a person who was a manager or a person who fits under a very small category around here.

Should job searches be this tough for anyone? Is there something else I should try?
