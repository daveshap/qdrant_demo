ARGYLE: If your friend is hot to trot...I know a couple of mama bears. ...Or is he married?
MCCLANE: Married.
ARGYLE: The girl was off today. Hey, I didn't expect you to sit up front. So, your lady live out here?
MCCLANE: The past six months.
ARGYLE: Meanwhile, you still live in New York?
MCCLANE: You're nosey, you know that, Argyle?
ARGYLE: Hey, I'm sorry. When I was a cabdriver, see, people expected a little chit chat, a little eccentricity and comaraderie, I forgot how stuck up you limo guys were, so excuse me.
MCCLANE: It's okay, it's okay.
ARGYLE: So, you divorced of what?
MCCLANE: She had a good job, it turned into a great career.
ARGYLE: But meant her moving here.
MCCLANE: Closer to Japan. You're fast.
ARGYLE: So, why didn't you come?
MCCLANE: 'Cause I'm a New York cop who used to be a New York kid, and I got six months backlog of New York scumbags I'm still trying to put behind bars. I don't just get up and move.
ARGYLE: You mean you thought she wouldn't make it out here and she'd come crawling on back, so why bother to pack?
MCCLANE: Like I said, Argyle...you're fast.
ARGYLE: Mind if I play some tunes?
MCCLANE: How 'bout some Christmas music?
ARGYLE: That is Christmas music.
