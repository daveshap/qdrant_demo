BRUCE: Mr...?
EDWARD: Bruce Wayne. In the flesh.
BRUCE: Um...I'm pretty sure I'm Bruce Wayne. And you are?
EDWARD: Nygma. Edward Nygma. You hired me. Personally. Just like I tell everyone. Well, we've never actually met, but your name was on the hire slip.
BRUCE: I'm gonna need that hand back, Ed.
EDWARD: What? Ah yes. Of course. I'm sorry. It's just that...you're my idol. And some people have been trying to keep us apart.
BRUCE: Mr. Nygma, you'll forgive me for being rude. But what exactly is on your mind?
EDWARD: Precisely. What's on all our minds? Brainwaves. The future of Wayne Enterprises is Brainwaves!
STICKLEY: I really do apologize, Mr. Wayne. His project was terminated this morning...
EDWARD: Let me ask you something, Bruce. What is man's greatest tool?
