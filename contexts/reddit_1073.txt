Call me crazy but I'm loving the lockdown and curfew thingy.
It's really crazy but I'm lovin' it. I'm particularly not anxious about corona since my city barely had one case and barely 10 or lower cases in my state. It's all been taken care of, so. But still, with lockdown and curfew as precaution, I kinda like it. I went up to the roof of my apartment and noticed how quiet the world seems to me. It was kind of comforting. I felt at peace. There were no noise from construction beside me and the one in front of me. There were no noises from vehicles or people. The only sound were of my footsteps and the birds. Sigh, all the anxiety I had at home, vanished in mere second.
