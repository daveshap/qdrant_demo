MICHAEL: And no more demons. I told you they'd be gone.
JACOB: I don't believe this. It's a miracle, Michael. A miracle.
MICHAEL: Better living through chemistry, that's my motto.
JACOB: It was paradise, Michael. You showed it to me. You were there.
MICHAEL: Well that's good to know.
JACOB: Mike, it was real. It was glorious.
MICHAEL: Glorious. I'm not surprised. I fed you enough of that stuff to send a horse to heaven. I'm just glad you came back.
JACOB: I would have stayed there if I could.
MICHAEL: I'm sure. You've got nothing but troubles waitin' for you here.
