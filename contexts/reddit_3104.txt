What is a day as a market research analyst like?
I am looking into applying for a position as a market research analyst.  I would like to work in a analytical field but also have some autonomy and creativity involved.  My biggest concern is I cannot do too much customer service type work.  Is this something I might enjoy? What is a typical day like?  How much time is spent on the phone?
