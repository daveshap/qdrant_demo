I prefer my fake life
(First of all sorry for my English, it is not my mother tongue)
Title. I am a 18 y.o. boy and for almost two years I have been creating fake profiles on social media, last one I created is the only one I use now and is a 18 y.o. girl. With her I have many online good friends and I can talk with them when I feel sad, they always make me feel better and that's the reason I can't delete that fake profile. I could but never take advantage of that profile for making money or anything, the only thing I want is friends.
In my real life I have a couple friends but they're as emotionally reserved as me, so we don't talk about our problems or emotions. I tried but can't find a friend who can talk about this. Where I am from boys must be cold and without emotions.
I want to leave that fake profile because I'm too attached to it, I spend hours per day on it, but I can't. I don't know what to do. Help is appreciated.
