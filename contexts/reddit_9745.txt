Need help deciding on a Higher Education Masters Program. And advice would help.
I just interviewed for a graduate assistant position that unfortunately does not pay for graduate school. I'm okay with it though because I am excited about the opportunity. I started looking into programs nearby, but nothing is close enough to where I will be. Which leaves me with online programs. So I have two questions. Is an online degree okay? And specifically an online degree from Walden University. I'm on a budget and the program can be done at a reasonable price. 

Thank you in advance for the advice!

Edit: I was asked to describe the asstantship a little. I would be a GA for there's life department. I would be responsible for 1 of the buildings on campus and would participate in the on all rotation. I would also have my own RAs that I am responsible for hiring and training. They give me a fully furnished apartment, a meal plan, and I work 20 hours a week for a monthly stipend. They do not have a masters in higher ed at the campus, so is have to travel to another school 

Edit 2: I've totally taken walden out of the thought process. I appreciate all the input!
