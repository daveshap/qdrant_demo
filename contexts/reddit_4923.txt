I don't know how to approach teacher about F in the class
Hi everyone. I'm currently in my second semester of college and my depression has really taken a toll on me. I have been really trying to get my shit together and for the most part I have- except for my journalism class. I have never gotten below a C in a class, but right now I have an F because of missing assignments.  I'm registered with my school's disability center but I don't think that will help me with this. The teacher emailed me to tell me that I was failing and that I could go to his office hours if I wanted to discuss my grade. I am terrified that he is going to withdraw me or tell me that it's my fault (which it basically is). Has anyone gone through this? Were you able to pass?? Any advice would be appreciated.
