Feeling Stressed after 2 weeks of “Training”
Hi everyone. So I recently got my first job in the tech industry as technical support agent  and at first I was excited thinking this would be a good stepping stone in software development. However my first two weeks of training consisted of word doc where I answered questions about the said product I am helping people with and mock cases to answer.  

The Word document gave me links to read that were either dead or didn’t help answer the questions at all. Whenever I brought this up to my supervisor I was just told “ to go figure it out” and my co-workers were often busy and can’t help me as much. The mock cases didn’t even cover what I learned in the Word Doc and I was somewhat scolded that I was taking so long to figure them. I’m just feeling defeated and they told me that I won’t be getting cases anytime soon because I’ve been so slow. I’m not sure what to do here, should I just suck it up and work extra hard to get things correctly or maybe look for some other job I would be suited better for?
