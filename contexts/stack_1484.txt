Phase Shift Keying: Is it ever actually used? during my course in digital communications Phase Shift Keying is talked about where the modulation consisted of altering the phase of the carrier signal. This process takes up a lot of spectrum so I am wondering, is it ever actually used in wireless communications?Or when PSK is talked about, is bandlimited PSK implied which amounts to QAM with a circular constellation?
