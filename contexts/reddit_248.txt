My 15yrold bestfriend had sex
so basically my best friend and I have been friends since we were in middle school. Recently she's been talking to this new guy and he has the same pattern as the last few exes she's had and he's just overall not that great. She really likes him and if she's happy I want to fully support her but I give her bits and pieces of my concern from time to time and I always remind her to be careful when she's with him. They've only known each other for a month and she just recently told me that she had sex with him. He's also in the 12th grade meaning he's almost 18 in just a few weeks. It wouldn't be that big of a deal and we were older and if this weren't her first time doing this. I don't know what to do to get her to understand my concern for her well-being and safety I honestly I'm just right for her and I need someone to please tell me how to handle this because I have absolutely no fucking idea what to do.
