What's your preferred way of explaining the outline of your paper in the text?
Revising a paper and the moment, so naturally I'm more interested in being on this sub than actually doing work :)

I've been thinking about the best ways of "telling them what you're going to tell them, and then telling them, and then telling them what you told them."  I like when papers give me an outline of what they're going to argue, and I feel that the most natural and clear way of doing this is by using "we"--for example, something like "We will begin by explaining research relating to A and B, and then will argue that because A and B, C."  My advisor HATES that format and always changes it to something about "the present study" or "the present paper" or something, such as "The present study argues that A and B, therefore C."  And I think in high school, my teachers told me not to use first person or refer to the paper (which I blame for my current bad habit of using passive voice in basically every other sentence).  

Anyway, it got me curious about everyone else's preferences. And if maybe there were different preferred styles in different fields?  Please discuss. :)
