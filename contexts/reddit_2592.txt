This is one for the employers. I found out I have lowest salary in the whole company, and now I feel like an idiot. What should I do?
I will try to keep it short. I got hired over a year ago in a Hotels & Resorts company, for the IT position. The list of my duties and projects grew and still grows rapidly and I manage to keep up even though I work alone.

The employer seems really happy and surprised, since he wasn't even sure I could do the job. I had a degree in Information Technology and zero experience, at the time. We work very close and he is my only supervisor. He keeps throwing problems and stuff that need solving and fixing at me, and I have never said "I can't do it, I don't know how."

I am a pretty fast learner, you see, and given some time I can have at least basic knowledge on anything that comes my way. A Jack of all trades, I guess, but mostly technology trades.

 In the winter months we started using Filemaker (data base platform), and I developed 2 solutions. One of which manages the payroll of all the employees. As you can imagine I, now, know everything.

I work hard, harder than I've ever worked. My worst fear is disappointing him and that says it all.

It also happens I have the lowest salary of all. Even the waiters at the buffet restaurant. I was a waitress, I don't wish to insult any one, but they don't work from home on holidays. Or answer the phone any time it rings even on my day off.

I believe I deserve a raise for all I do. And I will ask for a big one , too. But I don't want him to think that knowing the salary of others had anything to do with it. I feel it would brake his trust.

How should I do it?
