Does a magnet always reorient itself along the most efficient path? If a magnet is held in a magnetic field in which it is not in the position of lowest energy, the magnet will tend to reorient itself to align with the field. When reorienting in 3D space, there are an infinite number of paths along which the magnet could rotate to reorient itself to arrive at the same endpoint.Light always takes the fastest path to its destination. Does a magnet always reorient along the most efficient path of rotation?Note that typically, the magnet will tend to both translate and rotate into its ideal position. For the purposes of this question, I'm only interested in the rotation, as there is always exactly one vector between the origin and destination point in translation, so there's one logical option for translation, but infinitely paths corresponding to infinitely many options for rotation.
