RAY: Mr. Clear Moon.
CLEAR MOON: Our police are afraid of them. Please get them out of here.
CLEAR MOON: They're going to kill me next. That's what I hear. These new Indians are destroying everything. Our people are a quiet people.
RAY: They can lead us to Jimmy. Just let them go. We're tightening the net on him. We know he's on the reservation.
