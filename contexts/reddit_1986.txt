Why is everyone majoring in CS?
I just don’t understand the hype. I’ve always been a science and math person, but I tried coding and it was boring af. I heard somewhere that it’s because there is high salary and demand, but this sub makes it seem like CS is a really competitive field.

Edit: I know CS is useful for most careers. Knowing Spanish and how to read/write are useful for most careers, but Spanish and English are a lot less common as majors. That’s not really the point of my question. I don’t get the obsession that this sub has with CS. I’ve seen rising freshman on here are already planning to go into it, but I haven’t seen that with really any other major.

Edit 2: Half of this is just “why I love computer science”.  I’ve really enjoyed reading those comments! I posted this thinking that people were just in it for the money, but I see now that for most the money is just a plus and they’re pursuing by their passion.
