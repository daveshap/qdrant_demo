BO CATLETT: Last night. When he called me over to your office to talk about it.
HARRY: Chili Palmer showed you my script?
BO CATLETT: Yeah, I was wondering why he should do that.
MARTIN: The wife sues the airline. This is a gutsy babe.
CHILI: Good-looking, too. Like Karen.
MARTIN: So when do I meet up with the husband and give him the look?
CHILI: It's not that simple. You have to be careful. There's another guy that comes along, a hard-on you owe some money to. A mob guy. Wants to take you out anyway, on account of a past situation.
MARTIN: Okay. I'm listening.
CHILI: At that point, basically, that has to be it.
MARTIN: You're not going to tell me the rest?
KAREN: Well actually, Martin the movie we came to talk about is Mr. Lovejoy.
CHILI: Yeah. We understand you read the script and like it... a lot.
