How to change my career?
Hey everyone. Hope you are all safe and healthy. I always been working in the restaurant business since I was 16yo and I am 33 now. Iâ€™ve been lay off work 3 weeks ago because of the vivid situation and it looks like even when all of this is over the restaurant business will not be the best choice. I have a master in hotel and management school but I was thinking about changing my all career. What do you think will be the easiest and most successful way to do it?
I am originally from France and do speak French and English fluently. Thank you all in advance for your help!
Stay safe and healthy
