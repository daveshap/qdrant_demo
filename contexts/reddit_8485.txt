What information can my ISP collect and sell under S.J.Res.34 or the Congressional Review Act?
Will this include every time I play Angry Birds using wifi or cell data? Or will it just be every website I visit? Or will buyers have access to addresses, phone numbers, and credit card numbers I use on any device connected to their network?

Is this information being collected by someone else and sold off already? Can it help companies I like and want to have my day to day browsing data (but not info like my phone number or cc number)?

Could/will this make internet service cheaper?

This is the article where I've gotten the information I have about this situation so far: http://www.commondreams.org/news/2017/03/23/here-are-50-gop-senators-who-just-sacrificed-your-broadbandprivacy-corporate-profits
