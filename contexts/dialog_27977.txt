THELMA: I just don't see what it would hurt just to give somebody a ride. Did you see his butt? Darryl doesn't have a cute butt. You could park a car in the shadow of his ass.
LOUISE: I'm sorry. I'm just not in the mood for company right now. Here. Take this map. I need you to find all the secondary roads to Mexico from Oklahoma City. I think we should stay off the interstates. We're too conspicuous.
THELMA: Well, it looks like we can get on this road 81 that heads down towards Dallas, then cut over to...
LOUISE: I don't want to go that way. Find a way that we don't have to go through Texas.
THELMA: Wait. What? You want to go to Mexico from Oklahoma and you don't want to go through Texas?
LOUISE: You know how I feel about Texas... We're not going that way.
THELMA: I know, Louise, but we're running for our lives! Don't you think you could make an exception just this once?! I mean, look at the map. The only thing between Oklahoma and Mexico is Texas!
LOUISE: Thelma! I'm not gonna talk about this! Now find another way or give me the goddamn map and I will! You understand?
THELMA: No, Louise. How come you never said what happened?
