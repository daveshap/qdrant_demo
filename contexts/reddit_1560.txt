We Built an Ivy Rejection Simulator (to help you prepare for the real thing)
u/protiumoxide and I have built a website that allows you to simulate rejections from any Ivy League university (and a few other T20s).

**Here’s the site:** [**https://ivyhub.org/decision-letters/**](https://ivyhub.org/decision-letters/)

To simulate a rejection, click on the college you would like to simulate, and then click on the “Click Here To Simulate The Rejection Experience” button.

Let us know what you think, and good luck to you all!
