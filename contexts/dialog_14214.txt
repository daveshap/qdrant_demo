MARY: Well, are you coming in or aren't you?
GEORGE: Well, I'll come in for a minute, but I didn't tell anybody I was coming over here.
GEORGE: When did you get back?
MARY: Tuesday.
GEORGE: Where'd you get that dress?
MARY: Do you like it?
GEORGE: It's all right. I thought you'd go back to New York like Sam and Ingie, and the rest of them.
MARY: Oh, I worked there for a couple of vacations, but I don't know . . . I guess I was homesick.
