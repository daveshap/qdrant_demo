The girl I’m dating made me a playlist
So I’ve been on two dates with a girl who’s pretty quiet, because she’s quiet I sometimes second guess myself that she actually likes me. 

After the second date we were on our way back to hers when she passed out in the Uber and was sick on the sidewalk. I helped her roommates get her into bed and slept on the couch because I’m not an asshole. The next day we chilled together until like 4pm when she had work, I made her pancakes as a hangover cure and we just cuddled in bed all day, it was great. 

Anyway fast forward to now, we’re both away for the week and I’m second guessing myself again when she texts me saying she made me a playlist called “To ‘my name’” (we both love music). I thought this was one of the coolest things someone has ever done for me two dates in and it made me grin for 5 minutes straight, it made me feel so likeable. I made one for her too to reciprocate, but god damn I can’t stop listening to it.
