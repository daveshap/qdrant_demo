FRAN: I'm sorry, Mr. Baxter.
BUD: Miss Kubelik -- -- you shouldn't be out of bed.
FRAN: I didn't know -- I had no idea this was your apartment --
BUD: Let me help you.
FRAN: I'm so ashamed. Why didn't you just let me die?
BUD: What kind of talk is that? So you got a little over- emotional -- but you're fine now.
FRAN: My head -- it feels like a big wad of chewing gum. What time is it?
BUD: Two o'clock.
FRAN: Where's my dress? I have to go home.
BUD: You're in no condition to go anywhere -- except back to bed.
FRAN: You don't want me here --
BUD: Sure I do. It's always nice to have company for Christmas.
BUD: Miss Kubelik, I'm stronger than you are --
FRAN: I just want to go brush my teeth --
BUD: Oh -- of course. I think there's a new toothbrush somewhere.
