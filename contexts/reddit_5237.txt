How to balance workload in having 2 full time jobs?
Hey guys. So to give you a short background, I [22M]  am a full time developer for a local company in our city however due to the virus we were forced to stay at home and we aren't paid which is understandable.  However when the community quarantine is done we can go back to our company. 

Now it's been a month and we don't have any idea until when this quarantine is. Because I'm the breadwinner for my family, I searched for remote jobs and I recently got hired for a remote position. The new company I work in is aware that I am also a full time developer is my place.

Now what I am kinda concerned is maybe I might get overwhelmed with the tasks of the 2 jobs I have after the quarantine. Do you have any advice as to how I can be able to successfully finish future projects/tasks of my 2 jobs? Asking for advice from people with similar experience. Thank you!
