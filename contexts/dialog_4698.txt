BOURNE: Are you Treadstone?
CONKLIN: Am I Treadstone? Me? What the hell're you talking about?
BOURNE: <u>What did you do to me</u>?
CONKLIN: What did I do? I spent thirty million dollars on you. I spent three years finding you -- four years training you -- What did I do? What in the name of God have you been doing, Jason?
BOURNE: I don't know.
CONKLIN: They're right about you, aren't they? You're fried. You really don't know what's going on, do you?
BOURNE: I know you've been trying to kill me.
CONKLIN: Of course. We had to try. We didn't know what was wrong. We didn't know you were in trouble.
BOURNE: So now you know.
CONKLIN: So it's time to go home.
BOURNE: That's all I get?
CONKLIN: We'll make you better. We can put the pieces back. We can do that.
BOURNE: I don't think so.
CONKLIN: We have to go home, Jason.
BOURNE: Jason Bourne is dead.
CONKLIN: <u>There never was a Jason Bourne</u>. You have to come with me. It's the only way. We can give it back to you...
BOURNE: Keep it.
CONKLIN: Jason... They can't let you go...
BOURNE: That'll be their second worst mistake.
