How would you feel if your current job tracks and records every mistake you make?
So my job is implementing a system where essentially every mistake you make will be recorded and tracked. It is (allegedly) supposed to help correct errors and hold people accountable for their mistakes, but I can't help but feel somewhat uncomfortable about this whole idea. We already have issues with micromanagement at my job and this just feels like it will further exasperate the issue.

How would you feel if you're job did this? Or have you worked at a job that did this and how did it turn out?
