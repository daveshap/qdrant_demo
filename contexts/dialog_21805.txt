ROSE: What are you studying now, Mrs. Hillyer?
MOTHER: More history, Rose.
ROSE: Are you going to get your degree soon?
MOTHER: Well, I am working on my thesis.
ROSE: It must be wonderful to be so smart. I don't see how you do it, reading all those books, learning all that stuff.
MOTHER: Rose, you work too hard. Why don't you go sit down somewhere and drink a Co-Cola?
ROSE: You're so sweet.
MOTHER: Really, why don't you go sit down somewhere?
ROSE: I like to work. I don't mind work. It's the least I can do after all you and Mr. Hillyer have done for me. You're so sweet. There never was nobody like you.
MOTHER: Well, you run on now.
ROSE: Yes, Ma'am.
DADDY: Good morning, sweetheart. Beautiful day.
MOTHER: Yes, it's so nice I thought I'd work outside.
DADDY: How goes it, darlin'?
MOTHER: Slow, hon. But at least I can concentrate now that Rose is here.
DADDY: What do you think of her, honey?
DADDY: Turn up your hearing aid.
MOTHER: What?
DADDY: Your hearing aid, it's buzzing at me like a snake.
MOTHER: Oh. Did you say something?
DADDY: I asked you what you think of Rosebud, now that she's been here a while.
MOTHER: Honey, she's perfect. She works all the time and she's wonderful with the children. And they love her, even Brother likes her though he won't admit it. I think she's just perfect.
DADDY: Um-hmm. Almost too perfect.
MOTHER: And she's such a good-hearted thing, there isn't an ounce of harm or malice in her.
DADDY: Well, I'll admit I don't see any flies on her yet.
MOTHER: There are no flies on Rose, I don't know what you're talking about.
DADDY: Well, she must have done something to encourage those scoundrels in Birmingham, even if she did run away from them.
