NICHOLSON: Look, sunshine, we found a sandwich bag of uncut cocaine -
DIMES: Not a tiny little vial -
NICHOLSON: But a fuckin' baggie.
DIMES: No don't sit here and feed us some shit.
NICHOLSON: You got caught. It's all fun and fuckin' games till you get caught. But now we gotcha. OK, Mr. Elliot actor, you've just made the big time -
DIMES: You're no longer an extra -
NICHOLSON: Or a bit player -
DIMES: Or a supporting actor -
NICHOLSON: You're a fuckin' star! And you're gonna be playin' your little one-man show nightly for the next two fuckin' years for a captive audience -
DIMES: But there is a bright side though. If you ever have to play a part of a guy who gets fucked in the ass on a daily basis by throat-slitting niggers, you'll have so much experience to draw on -
NICHOLSON: And just think, when you get out in a few years, you'll meet some girl, get married, and you'll be so understanding to your wife's needs, because you'll know what it's like to be a woman.
DIMES: 'Course you'll wanna fuck her in the ass. Pussy just won't feed right anymore -
NICHOLSON: That is, of course, if you don't catch Aids from all your anal intrusions.
