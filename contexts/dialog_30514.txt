MADISON: Can I ask you something?
PARKER: You mean there's something you haven't asked me?
MADISON: You've already fulfilled the terms of your pardon. You stopped Sid 6.7 and you've got his module. You're free to go —— right now. Why are you going to do this?
PARKER: You don't know?
MADISON: That's why I'm asking.
PARKER: Because this pain—in—the—ass criminal psychology expert has helped me understand what I'm capable of. And what I'm not. And better than anyone else, I am capable of stopping Sid 6.7.
