DESMOND: Did you know Teresa Banks?
CLIFF: Got a couple of cups of coffee at Hap's from her. That's it. By the way where do you get off questioning a lawman? I could ask you the same question.
DESMOND: No you couldn't.
DESMOND: Is there a golf course around here?
CARL: Not a lot around here, no. Got some clubs, but not very many fellas with balls.
DESMOND: Thanks for your help, Carl. Sorry we woke you up.
CARL: That's alright. I was having a bad dream. I was dreamin' about a joke with no punchline.
STANLEY: I couldn't help but notice that you had a suspicion that Deputy Cliff was the murderer. You did think that, didn't you, Agent Desmond?
DESMOND: He's not the murderer. But he's a bozo.
STANLEY: Yes, he is like a clown.
CABLE: What the hell is that thing doing out there? You're not taking that body anywhere.
DESMOND: We're taking the body back to Portland and there's not a thing you can do about it.
CABLE: Maybe not a thing, but maybe two things.
DESMOND: Teresa Banks had a ring. Any idea what happened to it?
CABLE: We got a phone, here, that's got a little ring.
DESMOND: Sam, get the body and put it in the van. Sheriff Cable, where were you the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
CABLE: My alibi is as strong as these bands of steel.
