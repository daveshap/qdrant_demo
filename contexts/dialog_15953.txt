MATHILDA: What's that man's name?
COP: Why do you want to know?
MATHILDA: He forgot his money... My mother's got a pub, behind the corner, and he forgot his money, about 100$.
COP: Huh? I see, but this is the FBI, little girl, and I can't let you in. But if you leave me his money, I'll give him it myself.
MATHILDA: Give me his name, I will mail him.
COP: OK. Mister Stansfield, Norman STANSFIELD.
MATHILDA: ...Office 2702.
COP: Yeah... How do you know it?
MATHILDA: ...I heard he said... That's all... Thanks.
