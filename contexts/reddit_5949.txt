Degree in Business but want to work in I.T. need some advice.
In almost finished with my Bachelors in Business, but I what I really want to do is work in I.T.  I have no experience though.  I've been in management for the past 10+ years.  How do I go about making this transition?  What steps do I need to take and what are some resources to help me figure out which field I want to pursue?  I am interested in programming/development and the cloud in particular, but I couldn't tell you exactly what career title I would want.  Thanks.
