JOHN: How many people do you think we've talked to already, outside the radio, I mean?
ANN: I don't know. About three hundred thousand.
JOHN: Three hundred thousand? What makes them do it, Ann? What makes them come and listen and, and get up their John Doe Clubs the way they do? I've been trying to figure it out.
ANN: Look, John—what we're handing them are platitudes. Things they've heard a million times: Love thy neighbor
JOHN: Yeah, I've heard them a million times, too, but—there you are. Maybe they're like me. Just beginning to get an idea what those things mean.
