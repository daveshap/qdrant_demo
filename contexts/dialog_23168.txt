VOICE: Do you think it's over Sidney? Do you?
SIDNEY: W-what do you want?
VOICE: I want to finish what I started. I want to finish the game.
SIDNEY: You sick fuck I'm tracing this call as we speak! The police are gonna nail your ass!
VOICE: Let them try. You'll never find me. I've already gotten away with murder before. For instance, Maureen Prescott.
SIDNEY: No. You didn't kill my mother. Billy Loomis and Stu Macher did.
VOICE: Heh. So you think Sidney. So you think. It's all been building up to this Sid. Every STAB. Every SCREAM. Every ounce of blood that's been spilled has all been leading up to this moment. WELCOME TOTHE FINAL ACT.
SIDNEY: The final act? Well let's play asshole!
VOICE: No. We play in my court this time. Come to Hollywood. STAB 3's going to cutting corners cast-wise. And I've got my eyes set on a technical advisor named Dewey Rielly.
SIDNEY: If you lay a hand on him I'll fucking kill you!
VOICE: Great. A spirited one. I'll be seeing you real soon Sidney. Real soon.
