SEAN: He married his cousin.
LAMBEAU: Who?
SEAN: Einstein. Had two marriages, both train-wrecks. The guy never saw his kids, one of whom, I think, ended up in an asylum--
LAMBEAU: You see, Sean? That's exactly not the point. No one remembers that. They--
SEAN: I do.
LAMBEAU: Well, you're the only one.
SEAN: Just...take it easy, Gerry.
LAMBEAU: Look, I don't know what else I can say. I'm not sitting at home every night, twisting my mustache and hatching a plan to ruin the boy's life. But it's important to start early. I was doing advanced mathematics at eighteen and it still took me twenty-three years to do something worthy of a Field's medal.
SEAN: Maybe he doesn't care about that.
LAMBEAU: Sean, this is important. And it's above personal rivalry--
SEAN: Now wait a minute, Gerry--
LAMBEAU: --No, no you hear me out, Sean. This young man is a true prodigy--
SEAN: --Personal rivalry? I'm not getting back at you.
LAMBEAU: Look, you took one road and I took another. That's fine.
SEAN: Is it Gerry? 'Cause I don't think it's fine with you. Give him time to figure out what he wants.
LAMBEAU: That's a wonderful theory, Sean. It worked wonders for you.
