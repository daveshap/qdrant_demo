Every girl I know is either pregnant or married.
I'm only nineteen, but it's kind of disappointing that everyone in my age group is wanting to grow up so fast. It also makes it really hard to freaking date anyone. 

I know there is more fish in the sea or whatever, but i'm just talking about my city. I really have no idea why someone would want to have child at 19 or 20.
