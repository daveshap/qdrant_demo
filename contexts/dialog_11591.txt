ROY: Her job.
MYRA: I want to know everything about you.
ROY: You do. And once I'm out of here, I'll remind you of the best parts.
MYRA: You heard the shower, didn't you?
MANAGER: I don't care about that. This time, I gotta have the rent.
MYRA: Joe, I thought I was gonna be all right by now, I just need a little more --
MANAGER: It isn't the owner, Myra, it's my wife. She knows what's going on. This time, I gotta have the money.
MYRA: Joe, you know you'll --
MYRA: Joe, could we talk it over? Do you want a drink?
MANAGER: My wife sent me here, Myra. For the money. She's waiting.
MYRA: I'll have it tonight. Nine o'clock? Ten?
MANAGER: This time...
MYRA: We'll work something out, Joe.
MYRA: I don't see why you're still here. You look healthy to me.
ROY: I just do what the doctor says, babe.
MYRA: You're just comfortable, that's all. You don't even ask to go home. You just lie around, let your mama take care of you.
ROY: Mama!
MYRA: Who else is paying for all this? You badmouth the woman all the time, but you sure do take the payoffs she gives you.
ROY: I'll pay Lilly back, don't you worry about that.
MYRA: I don't like to come here, Roy. Every time I do, your mother comes in and makes remarks.
ROY: That's just Lilly's way.
MYRA: And you never defend me. You're afraid of her.
ROY: Oh, don't be stupid.
MYRA: You're a mama's boy, if you want the truth.
