JIM: Thank God for Diane. She was my best friend, my source of love and strength. Oh sure, we'd had our share of bumpy times, but we'd always seen them through. After nine years of marriage, we were closer than ever. And the secret? Good communication.
DIANE: Anything wrong?
JIM: Everything's fine. Just, you know, school.
