EARL: Here's one for the books... a Toon wearin' human clothes.
VALIANT: Earl... it's me, Valiant.
EARL: Eddie? Jesus, what happened?
VALIANT: Toon cops worked me over.
EARL: Boy, I'll say. They gave you a real Toon-a-Roo.
VALIANT: What am I, Earl?
EARL: You're a pig... a happy-go-lucky pig.
VALIANT: No...
EARL: Does it hurt?
VALIANT: Not much. It's hard to talk.
EARL: Uh, Eddie, do me a favor. Could you sit in the back so you won't cause as much of a commotion.
