my boyfriend deserves something better
about 5 months ago i fell in love with this beautiful, fun and cute guy. and somehow he felt the same for me. 

im ugly, depressed, im not good at anything, my body isnt that great, i have random mental breakdowns at least 1 day per week. I know that several guys way better than me have asked him to date them, but he was already with me when it happened so he said no. Plus, we are a long distance relationship so i cant even give him fisical contact. 

And I cant stop thinking how much happier he would be if he chose any of the other guys that want to be with him. They all are more pretty, succesful and funny than me.

i dont know. he deserves better than me
