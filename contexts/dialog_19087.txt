NAPOLEON: You can always tell at a glance whether retreating infantry are being pursed by cavalry, because they hurry along and keep turning around and looking back. When they are retreating before infantry, they merely trudge along, head down.
ALEXANDER: Fascinating! Tell me, leaving aside the question of grand strategy, for the moment, what would you say is the single most difficult tactical skill to master?
NAPOLEON: Without a doubt, to estimate the enemy's strength on the battlefield. This is something that is only acquired by experience and instinct. At Jena, there were as many opinions about strength of the enemy as there were generals present. Murat said there were 50,000, preparing to attack. Berthier said there were no more than 25,000, about to withdraw. Berthier sees only what is in the open
ALEXANDER: Ah, my dear Napoleon, sometimes I feel that I am not really an Emperor as you are.
NAPOLEON: What do you mean?
ALEXANDER: I know absolutely nothing of war -- and I am still totally dependent upon my generals.
