How to verify SSL always being used on Postgresql 9.6 I have a sensitive application with app server and db on separate machines, and in the case of the slave db, in separate data-centers.Although I believe my postgresqls are configured to always use ssl I need a way to double-check this.Is there some simple way to check that all client connections are indeed being forced to use ssl?
