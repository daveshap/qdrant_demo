I'm not sure how to answer this question on the application. Help me?
I'm applying for a patient coordinator position, it sounds very much like a receptionist position which is what I'm looking for right now. They want someone with a year of "computer experience " and I find that really vague. I don't have work experience with computers because I just stock shelves at a grocery store but I've been using computers for 10 years for school. Does that count?
