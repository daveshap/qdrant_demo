TONY: Where to?
CHARLIE: Kennedy.
TONY: I know, I know, stupid. I mean where you goin'?
CHARLIE: It's an open ticket. I can go anywhere up to $350.
TONY: So?
CHARLIE: So I'll send you a postcard from wherever. If I get there.
TONY: Nervous?
CHARLIE: Yeah.
TONY: You flew before?
CHARLIE: No.
CHARLIE: Hey, come on...
TONY: Take it easy. I only asked because maybe I could, you know, let you have a little something.
CHARLIE: Yeah, well thanks, but I got enough to hold me. My mother can send me some. I don't know.
TONY: How about Teresa? I could talk...
CHARLIE: Listen, I appreciate it, but I'll handle it myself. I'll write.
TONY: And say what?
CHARLIE: I'll say that I'm travelling.
TONY: Listen, try a place with some sun. Swimming pools. Palm trees. Girls in little French bathing suits.
CHARLIE: Thanks for the ride.
