EDDIE: HOW MUCH?!
CHARLIE: My twenty-five per cent. Approximately fifteen hundred bucks.
EDDIE: Oh, you crumb. With that fifteen hundred I coulda beat him. That's all I needed, Charlie.
CHARLIE: Aw, Eddie.
EDDIE: C'mon, c'mon, just give me the money.
CHARLIE: What for? To play Fats again?
EDDIE: Yeah, to play Fats again.
CHARLIE: You wanna come back on the road with me, okay, the money's yours. But if you wanna give it to Minnesota Fats... nothing doing. What do you say?
EDDIE: You still don't see it, do you, Charlie? You are nothing but a small- time Charlie. You'd love to keep me hustling for you, huh? Wouldn't ya? I mean, a couple more years with me, scuffling around them little towns and those back alleys. You might make yourself enough to get a little poolroom back in Oakland. Six tables and a handbook on the side. Is that when you say goodbye to me, Charlie?
CHARLIE: Is that what you think?
EDDIE: Yeah, that's what I think.
CHARLIE: All right. That's what I want. Poolroom with a little handbook on the side. Getting old.
EDDIE: Lay down and die by yourself. Don't take me with you.
CHARLIE: Just like that?
EDDIE: Yeah. Just like that.
