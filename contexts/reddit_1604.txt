What have I done?
I have made a horrible, horrible mistake.

As I sit here, my college-app experience drawing to a close, I look back on my experience in high school and I now fathom how hard I’ve fucked up. 

I have no social life. I have very few friends, none of whom I ever see after school, I’ve never had a girlfriend, never been invited to parties, I’m horribly depressed, which only continues this terrible cycle. All because I needed to do homework and ECs.

I don’t want to be the diligent scholar anymore. I want to go party, I want to hang out with friends, I want to get a girl, I want to have fun. For once. And here I am, so horribly alone, as friends tear up thinking about their end of year-celebration, I do the same for my own lack of such an experience. If this is what Caltech wants, if this is what a “good student” is supposed to end up as,

God help us all.

EDIT: damn this blew up. It’s disheartening yet nice to see that I am not alone. I’m gonna stop replying to comments but I am both glad and saddened so many people empathize with this post.
