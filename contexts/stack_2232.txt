Keeping chunks loaded in minecraft I have built an iron farm somewhere far away from my actual spawn chunks in my single player world. In hindsight, this was a dumb idea, but I can't exactly change it anymore. I'd like to keep the thing running all the time, so I'm looking for a way to keep the chunks loaded.I'm running minecraft 1.12.1, is it possible at the moment? I have looked at some chunk loader mods, but chicken chunk loader hasn't been updated yet, and the others simply didn't work.I have tried moving the spawn chunks, but that hasn't done anything either.Edit: I have worked this out with IronAnvil, and it ended up being a render setting in optifine which didn't load them correctly somehow. It has been working fine after I reset my optifine settings to default.
