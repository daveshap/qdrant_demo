I wish he would be mine

I'm 16 year old and had a online best friend who is the same age. He became really sad and depressed after a while... I was always there for him and he was always there for me but then he suddenly deleted his account. After some weeks I found out that he made a new account but didn't message or follow me with it. I emetly messaged him and asked him why he is doing this to me coz me and him were really close. He said sorry and said that he was thinking about me the whole time. He still don't follow me now but I stalked his account and did read every of his post... And well... One of his posts said that his depression got so worse that he didn't want to bother his online friends and that's why he made a new account. After the talk I had with him we never talked to eachother again and every day I'm just waiting for him to message me again or to at least follow me... It hurts so much coz we were so close... Some people may think I take it too serious but I even had a crush on him which he know but he said that he sadly already have a girlfriend. I don't know what to do... I just want it back like the old times... I want to talk to him again... I miss him.... This makes me so depressed... But I'm not sure if he want me to leave him alone or not

I even said to him that I will always love him and that I only want him but he said that he love me too (idk if he mean the ,, I love you,, as a friend or more coz he always call me sweetie) but have a girlfriend and didn't know that I have a crush on him. He also said that maybe I should look for a another boy... See everyone.... He said maybe and it looks like that he is kinda interested ... That's what confuse me... Does it mean that he would date me when he would be single? Or am I just too obsessed with him and imagine too much?
