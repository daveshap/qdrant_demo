Boss threatening to fire me over things outside my control
Hello, I am from Australia and I work as a crew member for a fast food restaurant. I have been working here for around half a year now, and I feel like I am an excellent employee. I greet customers/take orders with a friendly demeanor, I prepare food and orders immediately, I am never late to work, I am fast paced etc. I can't see any issues with my performance.


So my issue is my manager/boss has given me a 'last chance' warning for something completely out of my control. When taking orders from customers, the order appears on screens throughout the building regardless if the order has been completed or confirmed. I presume this is to save time so the food can be made whilst the customer is ordering. The problem occurs when a customer changes their mind before the order is paid for. 

For example:

1. Customer orders a meal with a chocolate milkshake. 

2. I enter the order onto the machine, and then tell them the price.

3. The customer then goes 'oh actually can I get that with a vanilla milkshake instead?'

4. I adjust the order and then they pay.


Since I started working here, I have seen this happen multiple times per day without fail. Only over the last few days has my manager come up to me and started blaming me for the order changing. She basically said to me 'the next time it happens, you will be fired'.


I am honestly scared to go to my next shift because I feel like I can be fired at any moment for something out of my control. I would say that she is looking for an excuse to fire me, but it could also be that she just reacting badly to food wastage. I don't know. Either way, is this a valid (although dodgy) way to get rid of me as an employee? Or do I have a case of unfair dismissal if I was to be terminated? Thanks in advance.
