Figures on both the American left and right accuse the opposing party of racism. Do either side's arguments hold any water?
Dinesh D'Sousa has made a movie called Hillary's America, and in it, he suggests that the democrats are racist and that black voters did noot switch because of racism. (http://www.thenewamerican.com/reviews/movies/item/23765-hillary-s-america-how-accurate-is-the-history)
However, the counternarrative is that the southern strategy in the 1968 election (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_strategy) turned people of color away from the Republican Party.
Is one party more or less racist than the other?
