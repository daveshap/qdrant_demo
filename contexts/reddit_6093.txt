Reaching out during their hiring freeze?
I’m really interested in a job and they emailed me about two and a half weeks ago to say that with the current situation, the position would temporarily be put on hold as the organization is closed for now. 

They emphasized that I would not need to resubmit my application when they choose to reopen. 

Would anyone recommend reaching out about possibly offering to assist remotely? They never accepted me explicitly, and I’d love to hold off on other applications so I can have this job in particular should they eventually choose to hire me. But I don’t want to be annoying exactly. I’d like to increase my appeal if possible by keeping in contact with them and offering to help as I can.

I don’t know if this made much sense, but any advice would be awesome.
