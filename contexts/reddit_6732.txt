Recruiter contacted me to gauge my interest for a marketing position. How should I respond?
Hello fellow redditors, 

I was contacted by a recruiter for to gauge my interest in a marketing position and would like me to schedule time to speak.

I was recently hired as a Marketing Specialist at my current company and have been there for about a year. 

I am not really looking but I am interested in what this position is and the compensation. How should I respond?
