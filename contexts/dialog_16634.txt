CLAIRE: Honey, you're exhausted. Do you want to lie down for a little while?
PETER: I found the pentacle.
CLAIRE: She's been stalking you, Peter.
PETER: So you're going to kill her? Put the gun down Claire.
CLAIRE: Listen to me, I love you, Peter, I'm trying to protect you!
PETER: You really had me going, Claire. I was finally ready to propose to you.
CLAIRE: We're still going to be together.
