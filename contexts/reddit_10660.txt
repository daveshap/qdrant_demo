No hope, no strenght, no future.
I've spent 2 and a half years institutionalised, going in and out of different facilities. Been diagnosed with SzPD, paranoid schizophrenia, depression and social anxiety. Before that I've spent 2 years untreated, including a year in total social isolation. Was told by a psychotherapist that I was gonna spend the rest of my life in mental health care.

I've since got out and found a job I've always dreamed of having. I am trying to improve and integrate into society, but the effort seems fruitless. I feel like I am constantly lying to people by acting as if everything's alright, by smiling and pretending to be happy. Even my therapist couldn't tell the state I am actually in. Needless to say, even though I told him about it, he didn't help much.

I am taking antipsychotics and antidepressants, following any advice given in therapy. It's just not helping me against this.

I've tried looking for a suicide hotline, but there are no active ones in my country. So I've decided to post here and it's the first time I am opening about this to strangers. Please, don't tell me to discuss this with my family. The last time I've told them about it - they commited me to yet another mental hospital.

I don't believe in any possibility of this situation getting better, my energy is running out and each new day is a dreadful possibility. It won't take me much more to step over the edge, into death this time.
