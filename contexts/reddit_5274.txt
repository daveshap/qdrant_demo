How do you get over feeling like you're getting paid to do nothing?
I sometimes feel bad about my job.

I'll come in Monday and have nothing or little to do unless emergencies arise. I can call up the clients I have, like I'm supposed to do weekly, but I like to space them out over the week, and that only takes 5-10 minutes each.

Tuesday is the same.

Wednesday-Thursday are usually travel days. Leave at 9, get there at 10. Meet with clients if possible, get paper work completed with them. It doesn't take very long, so I'm done around 12-1, spend 2-3 hours waiting for a flight and then go home.

Friday I just finish up all my paper work around 12 and sit around on Reddit until the week is over.

I get paid 31 dollars an hour to sit around for the majority of my time and it feels like I'm somehow doing something wrong. Maybe it's just that before this, I'd only worked in kitchens.
