Labeled grouping by geometry in QGIS? I have a layer of lines that represent stretches of electrical conductors. These sections have a point of origin and an end point. One of its attributes is the length of each of the sections.Some of these sections have the same point of origin and the same ending point, so when I label these lines by their length, this repeated data appears for each of the lines and the data is repeated.I need that when labeling the layer, only the label of one of the lines appears, that is, that the distance between each of the points is represented. I have tried to do it by means of a labeling based on rules, and some function of aggregation by geometry, so that only one label is shown for each space between points.
