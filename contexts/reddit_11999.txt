Mental day off?
I honestly don't even know how to start or how to explain at all but I'll try.

I've been struggling with depression, anxiety and ocd for as long as I can remember. Over the years I've stopped going to therapy and stopped taking medication due to financial reasons. But the past few months have been getting quite rough for me mentally. I know I need help, but until I can afford it again I just have to keep my head above water but it's difficult. 

My long term relationship is taking some hits as I'm struggling to figure out my issues, and at work I recently got a promotion so that's a lot of extra pressure on me, and I'm struggling to keep up. I know it's not difficult work, I just feel mentally so exhausted that I can't get myself to do a thing. And I've been thinking of asking for a personal day so I can get some rest. But in all honesty I'm scared shitless. 

I struggle to talk about these things in person, so I don't know what to do. I want to ask for a day off before I mess up my relationship or work. And I can't afford either right now. I just feel so hopeless and powerless. I simply don't know which way to turn anymore...
