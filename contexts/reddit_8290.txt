How can the US government consistently spend more than it makes? Where does the extra money come from?
I recently came across this infographic. https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/115th-congress-2017-2018/graphic/52408-budgetoverall.pdf


2016 we spent 600 billion more dollars than we got. So where did we get the money? did we borrow it from other countries? are there a bunch of banks that we owe that money with interest now? Do we just print the money we don't have? what's going on?

and apparently this happens MOST years in the US government? how? If a person spends more than they make every year eventually they have to stop.

So where does the government get the bonus money?
