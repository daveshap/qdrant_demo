KEVIN: I have to tell you something --
DENNIS: We gotta find a way outta here is what we gotta do!
KEVIN: It's about Mars --
KEVIN: That cop didn't pull his gun. Mars lied. He just started shooting!
DENNIS: Bullshit. Why would Mars do that?
KEVIN: I was <u>there</u>, Dennis! I <u>saw</u>! It's like he <u>wanted</u> to shoot that cop.
DENNIS: You're being stupid. Check out the bathroom. Maybe we can sneak out a window --
