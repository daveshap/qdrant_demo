Is it bad I asked to change my training?
So long story short, I have an issue of being a people pleaser. Got hired for a job on spot today for a part time office job, she loved me, liked my resume cover letter and just me in general. She asked if I could train this Tuesday and maybe Thursday. I said yes since I’m a people pleaser.

Issue is ... Tuesday and Thursday this week I had already committed to watching people’s kids for their back to school night events! And yeah, canceling childcare is kind of a hassle to deal with and can leave the family hanging. 

So I emailed saying:

Hi ____ - 

I am working Tuesday and
Thursday this week. I had already committed to these days and I don’t feel comfortable cancelling. Can we please change training to the following week?

Let me know!

Best,

(Me)


Should I not have done this? I’m worried about it costing me the job etc. but I just felt bad also breaking my prior commitments.
