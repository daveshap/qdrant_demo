There are good men out there
I accidentally drank too much on a second date last night. The night was long and the drinks were constant. I swore I was feeling fine, a little buzzed, and then all of a sudden it hit me like a sack of bricks.

I was in no place to be taking the train home alone. My date, one of the kindest guys I’ve ever gone out with, asked if I would be ok to take the train home. He was concerned for my safety and, based on prior interactions, I could tell this concern was genuine. 

He offered to let me stay at his place. I was reluctant, but it beat the alternative of going on the train and the possibility of falling asleep and missing my stop. He promised he would do whatever was needed to make sure I was safe and comfortable.

I decided to go and I said, “I’ll go with you bc I feel like you’re a good guy.” And he said, “I hope I can SHOW YOU that I am.” 

That night, he did everything possible to make sure I was ok. Kept bringing me water, gave me something to eat, got me medicine, sat with me and talked to me. He even got out his guitars and we played music and sang together. He didn’t pull anything weird or try to instigate anything remotely sexual. He stayed up the whole night with me. The next morning, he got me a bagel and went out to get me Advil. 

I share this because, GIRLS - I want to reiterate that there are decent guys out there. And I know, I KNOW, it seems like the world is scary and so many cannot be trusted; but, rest assured, genuinely good people exist. And more men should follow this example. Thank you for coming to my TED talk.
