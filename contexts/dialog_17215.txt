HENRY: O'Reilly!
RADAR: Yes, sir?
HENRY: Dammit, Radar, wait till I call you! Tell Major Burns...
RADAR: One of the surgeons from the day shift will have to stay on duty tonight?
HENRY: Yes, dammit, and...
HENRY: O'Reilly, what is it? There aren't more choppers coming?
RADAR: I'm afraid so, Colonel.
HENRY: We've got too many wounded for us to handle now! Get on the phone right away and...
RADAR: Yes, sir, I'll see if I can reach General Hammond in Seoul for you. You think he'll finally break down and give us two more surgeons?
