Has ISIS, in the past, claimed responsibility for mass murder attacks they had no connection to?
The context of this question is the deadly shooting Las Vegas, in which case [ISIS claimed responsibility] (http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-lasvegas-shooting-islamic-state/islamic-state-claims-las-vegas-shooting-u-s-officials-skeptical-idUSKCN1C71SP), and [US officials didn't find any connection] (http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-lasvegas-shooting/las-vegas-police-look-for-motive-in-deadliest-mass-shooting-in-modern-u-s-history-idUSKCN1C70FU).

A popular reaction to ISIS claims, is that they often take responsibility for incidents they have no connection to. It is certainly a relevant question to ask if they took responsibility in the past for actions they had no connection to. I would like to see some examples of that.

For example the Mateen attack, he dedicated the attack to various terrorist groups, including ISIS. [In fact he did pledge his allegiance to ISIS.] (https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/13/us/orlando-omar-mateen-isis.html)

For me, I am more curious about examples of non Islamic terrorism, and I don't find it as important if the individual isn't part of an organization beyond being motivated by ISIS calls for violence. Nevertheless, someone else might approach this differently and you can show examples of ISIS claiming responsibility for any sort of Islamic terrorism too.

This question doesn't prove anything because the credibility of a mass murdering terrorist group is always in doubt, but it is still a relevant issue to examine, if nothing else, on a factual basis.
