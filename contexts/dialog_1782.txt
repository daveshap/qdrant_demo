Z: No -- you -- you don't understand!
FORMICA: Damn, I'm proud of you, boy. I wish I had a hundred ants of your caliber. The world would tremble. Now, time for some R and R. You're invited to the royal victory party!
Z: Royal victory party? Will...will Princess Bala be there?
FORMICA: Of course. The entire royal family will be there to honor you.
Z: ONE TO NOTHING!
AZTECA: Wait a minute, that's no soldier -- that's Z!
WEAVER: Z? <u>Our</u> Z? The little guy made it!
FORMICA: Son, you're an ant after my own heart. A warrior. An ant that looks death right in the face and <u>laughs</u>.
Z: Well, I generally just make belittling comments and snicker behind death's back. So, tell me, fellow war-monger...do you think Princess Bala likes men in uniform?
FORMICA: Well she better -- she's engaged to one. <u>Me</u>!
Z: Engaged? As in you're getting married?
FORMICA: Affirmative.
Z: So...you two are in love?
FORMICA: In love? I'm just a plain old soldier at heart. I'll tell you what I love -- the field -- blood -- death -- orders...and the company of other warriors.
Z: Wow, what a spread -- you know, there's a food shortage in the rest of the colony.
FORMICA: Yes, and do you know <u>why</u> there's a food shortage?
Z: ...Not enough food?
FORMICA: Negatory. <u>Too many ants</u>. And while we soldiers go out there, and fight, and bleed, and die for the colony, the namby-pamby workers live it up back home.
Z: Well I, I don't think living it up" is the right term -- how about "working themselves to death"?"
FORMICA: I tell you son, sometimes, at night, I see myself in battle, fighting a horrible, faceless enemy, with the future of our whole species at stake. And always, the dream ends with each of us plunging his sword into the other's heart...
Z: Oh, hey, that's great, I think I see an old war buddy over there, it's been fun chatting. Good luck with the hallucinations.
