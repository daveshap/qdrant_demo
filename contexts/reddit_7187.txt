New Employee Concern
I am being trained by an employee who has worked for the company for 15 years and I question his methods. There was a huge disagreement and the manager sided with the employee. He told me that he was concerned about me because I am too anxious about being detailed oriented. This is offensive to me as a new person learning a job that I am not familiar with. This has happened with the last 3 jobs that I have had. What am I missing? Any advice would be appreciated. TY!
