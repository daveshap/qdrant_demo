Anyone else ever felt like your social circles are too small to efficiently meet people you could date?
I’m kind of at that point, school just went online, my work circle is small and I’m not interested in anyone there, and my friends don’t know girls I would be interested in. I have just turned 21 today though, so hopefully all this covid stuff blows over sooner than later and I can go out to the bars and have fun.
