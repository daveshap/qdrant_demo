Employer not carrying on furlough from July 31st
This post is not for me, it’s for my partner, and I know from previous posts in here there is a lot of knowledgable people in here.

Sooo my partner worked in the same cafe as I, I was a team leader he was a normal cafe staff. (He went above and beyond organising events for them for free can I add which brought them in thousands) anyways we both had this letter/email saying they can’t continue the furlough from the 31st July. I’m guessing this is because they don’t want to top it up 10 percent. And they won’t be many hours for him to be invited back to work but he hasn’t said he hasn’t got a job... which is confusing anyways. Are they allowed to do this?? And just looking for general advice to see if anyone else has had this done to them. 

I got the same letter but was planning on leaving anyways as I have a better paying job now.
