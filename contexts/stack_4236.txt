What gas can I use to incapacitate pesky heroes? Supposing I have a room currently occupied by Jedi Knights, or some other force that I can't defeat with battle droids and brute strength. I wish to incapacitate the occupants of this room with a gas, which I will pump in using the HVAC system.I wish to capture the intruders alive, for torment purposes. What gas can I use that will quickly incapacitate the Jedi, but that also takes the longest to kill them?For example, if I pump VX gas into the room, the occupants with be quickly incapacitated, and killed. I wish them to pass out unconscious quickly, but still leave me a few minutes to revive them (once safely restrained) before they die.
