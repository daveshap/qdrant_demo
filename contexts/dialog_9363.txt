STACY: Hi, Mark.
THE RAT: Hi, Stacy. How are you?
STACY: I'm fine. Mark, I'm so glad you came over here because I want you to know something. I just thought I would tell you that I really enjoyed getting to know you this year.
THE RAT: Yeah? About fifty people I didn't know wrote that in my annual.
STACY: I know everybody says it, but I really mean it.
THE RAT: Really?
STACY: Yeah. I want you to have this picture, so you won't forget what I look like. And so you'll remember to call me over the summer.
THE RAT: Well, I don't know, I may be doing some traveling this summer. I don't know how much I'll be around... But I'll give you a call sometime.
STACY: I'd like that.
