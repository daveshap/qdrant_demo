The best part of dating
The best part of dating is when she embraces you in a hug that lets you know that she's not going anywhere. After the 2nd, 3rd 4th or 5th date, however long it takes. With my last 15 month relationship it was after the second date. We exited the restaurant and she immediately wrapped her hands around my bicep as we were walking to my car. She hugged my arm tight and put her forehead against my chest.

That's the best part. The games are over. It's just two people being their authentic selves from then on. Then you know that you've accomplished something unique and have something that could be very  important.
