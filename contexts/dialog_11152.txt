WHALE: Mr....Kay?
KAY: Bet you thought you'd never see me again. I didn't know if you'd be well enough to come to this party.
WHALE: You didn't?
KAY: I'm the one who got you on Mr. Cukor's guest list.
WHALE: You, Mr. Kay? How do you know George Cukor?
KAY: I interviewed him after I met you. I'm his social secretary now. Well, assistant to his secretary.
WHALE: I commend you. If you're going to pursue poofs, go after those who can do favors for you. You waste everybody's time when you court dinosaurs.
KAY: Don't think that, Mr. Whale. I love your movies. That's why I wanted you to come to this. So I could see you with your monsters.
WHALE: My monsters?
KAY: Don't go away.
ELSA LANCHESTER: Jimmy. How are you?
WHALE: Elsa?
ELSA LANCHESTER: I saw Una O'Conner a few weeks ago. She said you'd been under the weather.
WHALE: Oh, nothing out of the ordinary. Growing old.
ELSA LANCHESTER: We're all getting a bit long in the tooth.
WHALE: But you appear quite fresh, my dear.
ELSA LANCHESTER: Please. You shouldn't stand on my account.
WHALE: Perfectly all right. But if you'd like to sit --
ELSA LANCHESTER: I'm fine, Jimmy. I can only stay a few minutes.
WHALE: Of course.
ELSA LANCHESTER: What's our pesky friend up to now?
ELSA LANCHESTER: Is that Boris? Our little chum appears to be arranging a reunion.
WHALE: Oh dear.
