LIZA: Agent Lowry.
LOWRY: Wasn't my idea.
LIZA: Jonas?
LOWRY: It's his show for now. Look, you want to get some dinner? Inter- Agency cooperation and all?
LIZA: When I'm ready to compare notes, I'll let you know.
LOWRY: Your call. Have a good night.
LIZA: See? Wasn't that a lot easier than squealing tires and knocking over trash cans?
JERRY: Nothing is easy.
LIZA: How long have we known each other, Jerry?
JERRY: Six months. Eleven days.
LIZA: Till today, I haven't believed a word. Now, I'm curious. Six months, eleven days. I'm going to give you one more hour to impress me. Where to?
FLIP: <u>Jerry</u>? You didn't show last night. First time ever. Had me worried, boy.
JERRY: Sorry, Flip. Got sidetracked.
FLIP: Saved you last night's, too.
JERRY: Flip was a hero in Vietnam.
FLIP: Sure was. Pounded the V.C. for this Greek cat named Ari Onasis.
