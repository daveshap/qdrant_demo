Interview as a data analyst with no background: advice?
So I've been looking to branch into data and I've managed to score an interview for an entry level position. However, the position requires a proficient amount of knowledge surrounding VLOOKUP, Access, and SQL (particularly Joins). 

Now normally I wouldn't have even gotten the interview since I don't have a background in this, but the hiring manager assures me that "they can teach someone these things". 

That being said, I've heard that before and it never worked out so what are some good resources I can use to learn the basics of each so I don't come in looking like a complete asshole.
