How to automate deleting what's inside the search box in the Dictionary app after 3/5 seconds? I use the Dictionary app many times when I'm reading a very old novel, and sometimes I write two words side by side without realising it (until I get no result), with that said, I need to tweak the Dictionary app so that it'd delete the word I've searched for after, say, 5 seconds of writing that word in the search box. Is it possible to do something like this?Sorry for being verbose.Huge thanks in advance.
