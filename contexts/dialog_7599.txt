DONNIE: Will you still be working at Yarn Barn? 'Cause that's a great place to raise children.
ROSE: No, a year of partying is enough. She'll be going to Harvard this fall.
ELIZABETH: I haven't been accepted yet, mother.
ROSE: If you think Michael Dukakis will provide for this country prior to the point when you decide to squeeze one out, then I think you're misinformed.
SAMANTHA: When can I squeeze one out?
DONNIE: Not until like... eighth grade.
ROSE: Excuse me?
ELIZABETH: Donnie? You're a dick.
DONNIE: Whoa, Elizabeth. A little hostile, there. Maybe you should be the one in therapy. Then Mom and Dad can pay someone two hundred dollars an hour to listen to all of your thoughts... so we won't have to.
ELIZABETH: Maybe you'd like to tell Mom and Dad why you stopped taking your medication.
