Had a ‘documented conversation’ but boss had no specifics
My boss and I butt heads. We are at different ends of our careers, we communicate and work differently. It is a challenge but we acknowledge it and try our best. I have kids and my husband takes the majority of their sick days, my grandmother died since being hired, and my mom was recently in the ER. 

Recently a team deadline was missed, I did 70% of the project split between 3 other part time staff. Yesterday my boss had a typed up ‘record of conversation’ regarding my absenteeism, missed deadlines and how that impacts the team dynamics. She was unable to give any specifics to me about work and missed deadlines. I also have the majority of my time off approved and have notified ASAP with sick kids and taken work home. She said there are no issues with how I am communicating these unexpected absences and that I am using available sick time. 

She was unable to provide examples where I did not complete work. She was unable to provide examples of when I did not make a generous effort to bring work home/make it up later in the week. She was unable to tell me what she expects from me moving forward.

To note, I have had a total of 14 absences since hired in July, 4 unplanned. She has had 27 planned days off. She also is only in the office 5-6 hours a day and I am there 8. She continued to emphasize that it is a full time job and I need to be there 40 hours because when I miss work it impacts the workflow.

She emphasized that my absenteeism is impacting the team culture and dynamic. She was unable to provide examples. 

When I asked for solutions as to how to move forward she had none. When I asked for an addendum to the document with examples she asked why. When I asked for a copy of the sick policy she said she didn’t know where to find it or what it is. 

How do I move forward? I did not sign anything but am expected to.
