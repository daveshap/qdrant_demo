DEAN FULTON: My fowl have polluted the yard.
PHILBY: Dean Fulton...
DEAN FULTON: Dr. Philby, Dr. Hartdegen. I received the most extraordinary letter last week. From a parent. We are always pleased to receive letters from parents. They are our employers, after all. This gentleman's son is in your class, Dr. Hartdegen.
ALEXANDER: I see.
DEAN FULTON: As I recall the syllabus the name of your tutorial is Applied Mathematics and Engineering"
ALEXANDER: Exactly correct, sir.
DEAN FULTON: Well, just as I thought. Surely it's all been a terrible mistake. This parent actually suggested that your freshman course in applied mathematics has somehow become a seminar on theoretical physics!
ALEXANDER: Imagine that.
DEAN FULTON: But I know that none of my faculty would ever deviate from the assigned curriculum.
ALEXANDER: Well... perhaps I have deviated" the tiniest bit."
DEAN FULTON: Might I ask why?
ALEXANDER: Because the assigned curriculum is boring.
ALEXANDER: Sir, that curriculum is forty years out of date. The students today are looking toward the new century -- they want to be challenged and inspired, not spoon-fed dusty old equations that have been proved a thousand times. They want to explore.
DEAN FULTON: Do they?
