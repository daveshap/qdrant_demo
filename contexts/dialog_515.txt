MARSHAL: Anything new develop?
SANDRO: Unfortunately, no.
MARSHAL: Very well. First of all, I'll have them search the waters around the island. I brought two frogmen with me... Meanwhile, we'll take a look up around here.
SANDRO: Look, Marshal, with those deep crevasses, you'll need some rope and ladders...
MARSHAL: Don't worry, we've got everything.
SANDRO: Another thing; there's an old man who lives here on the island...
MARSHAL: I know, I know. One thing at a time.
