DBCC check on Always On Secondary Replica What is the best way to schedule DBCC check on all the nodes in Always On availability group. Can we just schedule the same job on all the nodes at the same time  including all the secondaries. In my environment all the back ups are happening on the Primary Node only. Any expert advice will be highly appreciated.I intend to use the Ola hallengren scripts.
