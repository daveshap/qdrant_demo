GENERAL RIPPER: Suppose that were the case?
MAJOR MANDRAKE: But -- why...that would be an awful thing to do, sir.
GENERAL RIPPER: Perhaps, Major. Perhaps. Pour me a scotch and soda, please. And help yourself to whatever you like.
GENERAL RIPPER: Don't fret about it, Major. There's nothing anyone can do about it now. I'm the only one who knows the three-letter code group for the CRM-114.
MAJOR MANDRAKE: I know that, sir.
GENERAL RIPPER: We've come a long way since World War II, Major. And the lessons we've learned are all in Plan-R.
MAJOR MANDRAKE: I suppose they are, sir.
GENERAL RIPPER: You're damned right they are.
MAJOR MANDRAKE: How much soda, sir.
GENERAL RIPPER: Just a squirt.
MAJOR MANDRAKE: That about right?
GENERAL RIPPER: Perfect. Thank you, Major. And now let's drink a toast.
MAJOR MANDRAKE: What shall we drink to, sir?
GENERAL RIPPER: To peace on earth.
MAJOR MANDRAKE: General Ripper, can I ask another question?
GENERAL RIPPER: Ask away, Major.
MAJOR MANDRAKE: Well, General -- I was wondering, why are you doing this? I mean why do you want to start the war?
GENERAL RIPPER: I've given it alot of thought, Major. Don't think I haven't.
MAJOR MANDRAKE: No, sir. I mean I didn't think you hadn't given it a lot of thought.
GENERAL RIPPER: Do you remember what Clemenceau once said about war?
MAJOR MANDRAKE: I don't think so, sir.
GENERAL RIPPER: He said war was too important a matter to be left to Generals.
MAJOR MANDRAKE: I see.
GENERAL RIPPER: When he said it, fifty years ago, he might have been right. But today, war is too important to be left to the politicians. Do you follow me, Major?
MAJOR MANDRAKE: I'm trying to, sir.
GENERAL RIPPER: You see, Major, at this very moment, while we sit and chat, a decision is being made by the President in the War Room. He knows that the enemy will pick up our planes on their radar in about twenty minutes.
MAJOR MANDRAKE: But when they do, sir, won't they hit back with everything they've got?
GENERAL RIPPER: If we haven't taken any further action, they certainly will. Doyyourhappen to remember the statistics on our casualties in the event of a full-scale enemy attack?
MAJOR MANDRAKE: Well, I think I remember reading the report on that. Wasn't it something like a hundred and sixty million?
GENERAL RIPPER: That's close enough, Major.
MAJOR MANDRAKE: But then why do you want to kill a hundred and sixty million of our people, sir?
GENERAL RIPPER: You're being dense, Major. I certainly don't
MAJOR MANDRAKE: I suppose we might catch them off their guard.
GENERAL RIPPER: Our missiles would impact before my planes were even discovered by the enemy, wouldn't they?
MAJOR MANDRAKE: I guess so.
GENERAL RIPPER: I know so, Major. I know so. And add to that, the whole Air Command force being committed to clobber everything they've got.
MAJOR MANDRAKE: But even then, we wouldn't get everything. I mean some missiles would abort, or they'd miss their targets, or maybe the enemy have some secret bases we don't know about.
GENERAL RIPPER: You're absolutely right. You forgot to mention their nuclear subs. But it wouldn't matter. Sure we wouldn't get off without getting our hair mussed, but we'd prevail. I don't think we'd lose more than fifty million people, tops.
MAJOR MANDRAKE: But if you just let things alone, we wouldn't lose anyone.
GENERAL RIPPER: Major Mandrake, I guess you don't follow what's going on too closely, do you?
MAJOR MANDRAKE: Where, sir?
GENERAL RIPPER: Where? Everywhere, Major. Everywhere.
MAJOR MANDRAKE: Well, I know they've been going on for years, and they haven't gotten any place.
GENERAL RIPPER: Not yet, Major. Not yet.
MAJOR MANDRAKE: And I guess they won't until they agree to let us inspect inside their country.
GENERAL RIPPER: You're very naive, Major. Don't they say they want disarmament?
MAJOR MANDRAKE: Yes, sir. But so do we.
GENERAL RIPPER: But we mean it because we are a peace- loving country. Are they a peace-loving country, Major.
MAJOR MANDRAKE: I don't know, sir. But they're just as anxious to avoid a nuclear war as we are. War just doesn't make sense any more, for anybody.
GENERAL RIPPER: But war doesn't make sense precisely because the weapons can kill an entire country -- right?
MAJOR MANDRAKE: Right.
GENERAL RIPPER: Then don't you realize the Bomb gives us Peace not War? And, if that's the case, I ask you again: Why do they want disarmament?
MAJOR MANDRAKE: Well, sir, like I said, for the same reasons we do. I mean, all the experts say the most likely way for War to start nowadays is by an accident, or a mistake, or by some mentally unbalanced person --
GENERAL RIPPER: Go on, Major.
MAJOR MANDRAKE: I was just going to say, as long as the weapons exist, sooner or later something's going to happen -- and that'll be it for both countries.
GENERAL RIPPER: I've heard the arguments. Like Napoleon's quote, There's one thing you can't do with a bayonet
MAJOR MANDRAKE: That's right, sir. And don't forget in a few years a lot of other countries will have the bomb. What if they start something?
GENERAL RIPPER: Go on, Major. You fascinate me.
MAJOR MANDRAKE: Well, sir, I remember an example that pointed out that if a system was safe on 99.99% of the days of the year, given average luck it would fail in thirty years.
GENERAL RIPPER: I still ask, why do they want disarmament?
MAJOR MANDRAKE: Well, for the same reasons we do, sir. Don't you see?
GENERAL RIPPER: No, Major, I don't. They have no regard for human life. They wouldn't care if they lost their whole country as long as they won.
MAJOR MANDRAKE: Gee, sir, that last remark doesn't exactly make all the sense in the world.
GENERAL RIPPER: Major, you're talking like one of them!
MAJOR MANDRAKE: Well, I'm not, sir. Honestly, sir.
GENERAL RIPPER: Don't be offended, Major. Our President holds the same views.
MAJOR MANDRAKE: Don't you think he knows something about this, General Ripper?
GENERAL RIPPER: I'll tell you what I do think. If they say they're for disarmament, I say anyone who says they're for disarmament is either a traitor or a damned fool.
MAJOR MANDRAKE: But, General, we're on our toes. We haven't agreed to anything for years. Inffact, a a lot of people say we never will.
GENERAL RIPPER: But if they suddenly opened up and gave us the inspection we want, we'd agree, wouldn't we?
MAJOR MANDRAKE: If they gave us what we think we need, yes, I guess we would.
GENERAL RIPPER: And you'd like to see that?
MAJOR MANDRAKE: General, what's good enough for the President and all the experts he's got working on the thing, is good enough for me.
GENERAL RIPPER: Do you think we'd cheat?
MAJOR MANDRAKE: No, sir. I'm sure we wouldn't.
GENERAL RIPPER: Do you think they would cheat?
MAJOR MANDRAKE: Look, sir. I'm no expert on the subject, but I've read some pretty sharp ideas the big boys have. Like, say, both countries agreeing to a million dollar reward and international protection for anyone who gives evidence of cheating to the inspectors. You can't hide those things without a lot of people knowing about it. And if I were going to try and hide a few, I wouldn't want to depend on the fact that some poor slob isn't going to run and blab for a million bucks. We're as smart as they are, and if they cheat, or even hold back information, we'd pull right out.
GENERAL RIPPER: Major, I hate to say this, but I think you've been enemy indoctrinated, and you don't even know it.
