Addicted to sadness
"Emotional pain can become an addiction.  A negative feeling, such as anger, worry, grief, fear, or depression, can become so habitual that you cannot live without it.  There are physical as well as mental reasons for emotional pain addiction.

When a person is continuously stressed by emotional pain, there are subtle changes in the body that create a dependency on stress-related chemistry. Changing habitual patterns of pain can be as difficult as giving up an addictive substance, such as nicotine, alcohol, or even heroin.  The emotional pain addict unconsciously seeks out situations that are sure to result in pain.  A history of prolonged, negative, stressful relationships is usually symptomatic of emotional pain addiction.  The feelings of love and pain are so frequently associated that they become one and the same.  Loving unavailable people and staying in intolerable relationships, for example, are signs that love and pain have become intertwined.  There are many such pain-linked feelings in the repertoire of pain addiction.  Understanding the physiological part of emotional pain addiction can make breaking these patterns easier."

"Every emotion, either positive or negative, is a blend of chemicals (neurotransmitters and hormones) that our brain instantly produces in response to thoughts. This cocktail circulates throughout the body producing corresponding sensations that are felt at both the psychological and physical levels. The chemistry of emotion is very addictive, if repeated frequently over a long period of time -- just like the chemistry of nicotine, alcohol and drugs. This is most noticeable in the case of negative emotions, as they produce stress hormones that our body, in a twisted, self-destructive way, can easily start craving like a drug."

"The presence of negative, distorted thoughts and feelings about reality leads to sadness and hopelessness. Sad people see themselves as worthless and get carried away by these emotions, leading them to abandon their usual activities. So not only do they perceive themselves as worthless, but they also abandon the activities that could counter this value judgment, which validates their beliefs.

This is where the vicious cycle begins, as they swap their routines and fun activities for a negative mood, without realizing that these activities could help them improve their situation and prevent their bad mood from intensifying. This creates a dynamic in which inactivity breeds more inactivity."

"When you live with depression for years, you can become dependent on the familiarity of the mood. The negative patterns of thought associated with depression can become like an unhealthy coping mechanism, much like drugs and alcohol are for addicts. The negative thoughts and moods associated with bouts of depression may start to feel like a false sense of security.

Whether this constitutes an addiction is debatable, but what is obvious is that it is unhealthy and dangerous to get comfortable or dependent on a depressive mood. It can mean that a person gets stuck in the negative thought patterns and finds it more and more difficult to change."

"So while my attachment to melancholy may not be “bad,” it would be beneficial for me to push on those moments to discover what I might be avoiding, what to bring to therapy rather than what to soothe away with a Solange album. Barth suggested that “one of the ways one might gradually get to those feelings is to really try to put into words what the melancholy feels like — physically as well as emotionally (like even where it’s located in your body and what color it is!).”

Perhaps the healthy way to approach melancholy is with moderation, to give room to those other stronger feelings even when it means making room for pain."
