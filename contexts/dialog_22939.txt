LLOYD: Check your mail tomorrow. I sent you a letter, a letter.
DIANE: Your letter came yesterday.
LLOYD: It did?
DIANE: Uh-huh. It was wonderful.
LLOYD: Why didn't you tell me?
DIANE: It was wonderful.
LLOYD: I've never sent a letter like that, you know? I mean, I felt like I wanted to tell you something, but I didn't put it in the letter, and I didn't say it, but I want to say it now, I'm not sure if I should say it, you know, 'cause people always say it and don't mean it, but I think that I mean it, so, um, I just wanted to tell you...
DIANE: No, we don't have to say it.
LLOYD: How do you know what I'm going to say?
DIANE: I don't know what you're going to say, but I think that...
LLOYD: I was just going to tell you that I love you. I said it.
DIANE: I know. Lloyd, let's not start putting things on this level.
LLOYD: What? This is a good level, isn't it?
DIANE: How can I look at you and say this?
LLOYD: Say what?
DIANE: I think that we should spend some time apart.
LLOYD: What's wrong?
DIANE: Well, I need to study, and...
LLOYD: You need to study?
DIANE: Yeah.
LLOYD: Okay, how much time do you need? I mean, you know, I mean you'll be leaving in a little while, so that's answered some questions.
DIANE: We'll see.
LLOYD: Okay. It's good knowing this.
DIANE: Yeah, uh-huh.
LLOYD: Okay, what did we just decide?
DIANE: We decided...
LLOYD: 'Cause I'm worried, did you just break up with me?
DIANE: No, no.
LLOYD: It sounded like you did.
DIANE: No. We decided that we're friends. I mean, I know it's a terrible word...
LLOYD: Well, if we're friends, why can't we see each other?
DIANE: I think that we should stop going out on dates.
LLOYD: I feel like a dick. You must think I'm a dick.
DIANE: No, I don't, I don't.
LLOYD: Yeah you do.
DIANE: Lloyd, we shared the most intimate thing two people can share.
LLOYD: You shared it with a dick.
DIANE: No I didn't.
LLOYD: Is this because of your dad?
DIANE: No.
LLOYD: Did you talk to Corey?
DIANE: Why, did you tell Corey what happened?
LLOYD: She figured it out. I'm sorry if that upsets you.
DIANE: No, that's fine. She'll tell everybody, but that's fine.
LLOYD: Did you tell anybody?
DIANE: Just my dad.
LLOYD: You told your dad?
DIANE: You have Corey and DC. I have my dad.
LLOYD: What, I'm sorry I said that. Forget I said it, it's what I thought I meant, but forget it.
DIANE: Lloyd, I love you, okay?
LLOYD: What is that? What are you doing with your hands? Talk to me, you're talking like that girl Sheila.
DIANE: Don't be mean, this is hard for me too.
LLOYD: Then don't do it.
DIANE: Oh shit.
