ROYCE: I've been trying you for five days. Don't they give you messages?
JORDAN: It's hard to find time to sleep, Royce. Much less keep up with my phone life.
ROYCE: How hard they making it on you?
ROYCE: That bad?
JORDAN: I feel like there's men here, there's women here -- then there's men. But hey, what'd I expect?
ROYCE: Well, not this. I was doing the Pentagon scene few nights ago. Got some fresh stuff -- about you. You may be in a hostile camp. I think someone may be taking steps to ensure that you crash and burn.
JORDAN: Me? Why me?
ROYCE: Don't you know? How they're talking about you?
JORDAN: I saw an article...
ROYCE: I can't walk two blocks in Washington without hearing about G.I. Jane." You're all over the place
JORDAN: So why are you telling me this?
ROYCE: Big symbols make big targets, Jordan. I think someone's gunning for you.
JORDAN: You know, Royce, I got enough heat on me without you turning up the jets, too.
ROYCE: I'm only trying to warn you in case --
JORDAN: Well, let me warm you: I'm going though with this. The more everybody fucks with me, fucks with my head, the more it just makes me want to finish. So don't expect me back crying in your arms any time soon, okay?
ROYCE: That's not what I want, Jordan. I mean... it is and it isn't...
JORDAN: Still can't make up your mind, huh? Gotta go, Royce.
ROYCE: Jordan. You watch your ass.
JORDAN: Sure. I'll join the crowd.
