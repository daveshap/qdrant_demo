HARRY: Assuming I go along with this, when can I have the five hundred?
BO CATLETT: Whenever you want it. The money's in hundred dollar bills inside one of those jock bags, you know? In a locker at the airport, waiting to be picked up.
HARRY: The airport.
BO CATLETT: It was waiting out there on another deal, one that didn't go through; one you don't want to know about.
HARRY: I don't know.
BO CATLETT: It's not the kind of thing you do.
