SALLY: Don't kid me. I'm in no mood for it.
BRETT: For once I'm dead on the level-- --crazy about you!
SALLY: Will you take some advice? If you're looking for romance--count me out-- --if you know what's good for you.
BRETT: But--
SALLY: --I know what I'm talking about. I'm no high-school girl looking through a window--reaching for the moon. Guess I'll be going.
BRETT: Sally--!
SALLY: Let's forget it--can't you see I kind of like you, too ... and I don't want to get involved.
BRETT: You mean that?
SALLY: Don't let's talk about it.
BRETT: You said it! How about a little action?
