SHINZON: Yes.
PICARD: So if I gave you my life, what would you do with it? Would you spend the years in a blaze of hatred as you are now? Or could you change? Could you try to remember a mother's touch you never felt? A father's words you never heard? Could you do that?
SHINZON: I don't know.
PICARD: But you want to.
