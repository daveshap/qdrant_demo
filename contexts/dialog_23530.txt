WESSEX: Your Majesty!
QUEEN: Why, Lord Wessex! Lost your wife so soon?
WESSEX: Indeed I am a bride short. How is this to end?
QUEEN: As stories must when love's denied--with tears and a journey. Those whom God has joined in marriage, not even I can put asunder.
QUEEN: Lord Wessex, as I foretold, has lost his wife in the play- house--go make your farewell and send her out. It's time to settle accounts. How much was the wager?
WESSEX: Fifty shillings. Pounds.
QUEEN: Give it to Master Kent. He will see it rightfully home. WESSEX gives his purse to VIOLA.
