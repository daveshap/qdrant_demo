Teenage siblings don't want to hang-out with me anymore :(
There's a 12 year gap between us, and due to rough circumstances at home, I pretty much had to raise them myself. Now, they're 13 and 15 years old, and the more they grow, the less they need me. Though it's a part of life, I'm having such a hard time with this! Before, we used to do everything together; We would go on outings, hike, swim, ride our bikes, watch movies, share secrets, and have a million other adventures. Now, all they want to do is stay at home to play on the computer or be on their phones. I try to compromise with them by taking them to places that I think they'll like. For example, last weekend we went to Little Tokyo since they're into Anime. If felt like pulling teeth for them to agree to go, but they eventually did. Problem is, they were miserable the entire time there! I even offered to buy them whatever they wanted, along with letting them chose where to eat, and even so they whined and moaned the entire time there. I don't know what to do anymore. It upsets me that they're not willing to compromise with me, and this usually leads to fighting and me taking away their phones/computers, which of course makes them hate me even more. I miss the bond that we had, but I understand that they're growing up and want their space. I just hate that they're growing up :(
