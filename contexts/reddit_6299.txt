Accepted public service job with the city, no word from HR yet
Hi!

I accepted a job with the city on May 13th over the phone, and then was told that HR would be contacting me shortly afterwards. I followed up a few days after (the 15th?), and was told that they just finished signing the paperwork for my position. Person told me that I should receive correspondence from HR by the end of next week.

End of next week rolls around today, and still no e-mail from HR. I left the manager a voicemail, but I'm not expecting to hear back until next week because of the Memorial day weekend.

I am kind of a paranoid person, and am already thinking that the offer was probably withdrawn, however I understand that public service jobs probably go through an extensive process.

Any thoughts/personal experiences to share? Thanks!

TL;DR I accepted a job with the city over the phone almost 2 weeks ago, no word from HR yet despite follow ups with the department manager.
