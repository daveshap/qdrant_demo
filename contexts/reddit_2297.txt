Stressed, Anxious, Depressed, Or Overwhelmed? This Is For You
Browsing A2C lately, I've noticed that a lot of you are barely treading water mentally.  Here are some of my reflections as someone who has been through it.  This is long, but it's true.  And it's for you.

TL:DR â€“ Life is long.  You can make mistakes and come back from them.  College is just one small part of life, so don't stress too much over it. Focus on who you are, the skills you cultivate, the relationships you build, and the things you love.

1.  **You probably feel like no one understands what you're going through.**  People outside of the /r/A2C demographic are usually pretty unaware and out of touch with the issues students here are dealing with.  It is tragic that so many of you feel that several of the most important relationships in your life are defined or impacted by college admissions.  Parents who love their kids and want the best for them try to nudge them to do their best, but often they do it by bludgeoning them with pressure, doubt, insecurity, and even derision.  Friends who loved each other through thick and thin find themselves adversaries fighting for one hypothetical spot at their dream school.  So many of you lie awake at night worrying and wondering.  Your days are a hamster wheel and your true free time, ferociously earned or stolen through dereliction, is spent on coping mechanisms.  It's hard for anyone outside of this to even understand at all how challenging and consuming it can be.  You aren't alone in feeling this way.  And you're going to make it.

2.  **You might feel judged or weak for being so stressed, and that's ok.**  It's not weakness; it's normal.  Many people outside of college admissions wonder how these struggles can be real or why students subject themselves to it.  It is all real because it is real in your life, and for many of you it has become real in the core of who you are.  This is why some of you even suggest writing your essays about college admissions (please don't!).  Others go through a Stockholm syndrome metamorphosis and fall in love with it.  If you're struggling and feel like you have no hope, hang in there.

3.  **Don't do anything that could mess up the rest of your life permanently**. Life is long, and your time dealing with your current set of problems and stressors is coming to an end soon. When you go to college almost everything in your life can change and you can change with it.  You don't need to feel trapped, hemmed in, or limited by disappointment in who you are and what you currently struggle with.  Even if everything doesn't improve in college, you get another chance to "reboot" when you graduate and enter the workforce.  There are so few things in life that are permanent and once you establish independence as an adult you will be shocked by how much freedom you have to change things or do things differently.

4.  **Grades and test scores aren't everything.** I know many, many successful people who didn't manage a 3.0+ in high school OR college. All of them got jobs and are off to solid careers. You'll be fine if you can make it to college. I know people who did not make a 1000 on the SAT, but still went to college and now have successful careers.

5.  **Failure is a part of life, so never let one or two failures derail you**. Most successful entrepreneurs aren't very successful with their 1st or even 2nd and 3rd attempts to start a company. Most students get rejected from some colleges or internships. Well qualified and even over qualified candidates get rejected for jobs all the time. Researchers find ideas that don't work after years of pursuing them.  It's part of being human. Don't let failure or rejection bring you down or defeat you. Just remember, you can only go to one college, so it only takes one college to accept you. You only have one job or summer internship, so you only have to get one offer.

6.  **Once you go to college and establish your independence, it won't matter as much what other people think**. You will at some point be able to define for yourself what success means to you.  For most of you, success is being defined for you right now, but that isn't going to be true for much longer. Once you're in college or out on your own, you determine that for yourself.  In college, you can absolutely get a great support network between friends, roommates, professors, advisors, and teammates. Once you graduate you will have other opportunities to find supportive people in your life. If your existing relationships are terrible or toxic, remember that they aren't going to be as significant of a factor in your life once you head off to college.  Not even close. Hang in there and you'll be fine.

7.  **If you don't get in to your top choice, don't let it bother you**. There are tons of incredibly successful people who went to safety schools. Success isn't a one-time thing either. Graduating as valedictorian certainly helps you get a leg up on admissions to college, scholarships, etc. But it's not going to make you any friends, and no one is going to care once you start college. Even employers don't care about high school stats once you go to college. Once your career is off and running, your college GPA and performance won't matter as much either.  So stop panicking and obsessing over it and focus instead on living your life.

8.  **To be successful, you have to have good habits, work ethic, skills/talents/abilities, etc. You can't just succeed at one thing one time and declare yourself a success**. That's why your habits and steady state behaviors make a bigger impact than your one time accomplishments (like getting into your top choice, graduating #1, etc). If you're doing the right things, building skills and using them, and working hard, you'll be fine. Often, failing helps you hone those behaviors and skills much better than success does. A lot of successful people see failures as "paying tuition" to learn how things work or don't work.  Here's my point - Larry Page was an ok guy but he wasn't anything special in 1997. He went to Michigan for undergrad, and hadn't accomplished anything that remarkable. Sergey Brin was the same way - he went to Maryland (where his dad was a prof). But they started Google together and are now two of the richest and most successful people in history. Their careers at Google are riddled with mistakes and "failures" too. But they learned from it, and continued to work hard and get better.  Getting in to your dream school might feel like the pinnacle of existence right now, but it's far from the end goal.  Keep your focus on your own end goals and remember that going to college is just a step in that journey.  There are many paths to success, and going to any one specific college isn't going to make or break anything.  Relax.  You don't have to go to a top college to get a great education or have an incredibly rewarding life and career.  FAR more than where you go, it will matter what skills you cultivate, what relationships you build, and what you personally achieve and learn.  Life is stressful enough - don't pile on by worrying about some "perfect" trajectory or micromanaging the steps to attain some lofty goals.  Things rarely go according to plan.  They also rarely end with you destitute and living under a bridge.  No matter what happens in the next year or five, you will probably be fine.  In all honesty, the biggest risk in your life is not that you fail at the things you're working toward.  It's that you handle the stress poorly - turning to unhealthy eating, drugs, thrill-seeking, or whatever else to deal with it, battling depression & its repercussions, etc. 

9. **Try to relax**.  Remind yourself that life is long and you can still be crazy successful even if you don't get into your dream school.  Take a break.  Go for a walk.  Call a friend and talk about sports or celebrities or Fortnite or anything but college.  Get some exercise.  Read a book just for fun.  Plan some time in advance for you to spend unwinding.  If that means you have to work harder for a few days leading up to it so you have the bandwidth, then do it.  

10.  **Don't worry so much about where you go to college**. There are so many things that matter more than that in life. Your success in life will be far more dependent on the skills you build, the personal & professional relationships you curate, and how you perform wherever you end up. But more importantly, you need to worry about *you* right now too. Specifically, the habits you form, how you handle stress & anxiety, how you manage your mental health, what coping mechanisms you pursue, how you balance long term and short term goals, and even how you define success in the first place.  It may surprise you, but [most of the top 1% of students **by any measure** do not attend an Ivy League school](https://old.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/7yprmn/most_of_the_top_1_of_students_nationally_by_any/).  The entire top 40 of colleges represents just ~3% of all students.  You can be in the top 5% of students nationally (again, *by any measure*) and still not attend a T40.  The take away here is that you should focus on yourself and who you want to be, not on a specific college or sub set of colleges.  There are tons of colleges where you could go get a world-class education and be successful.  You don't have to go to a top 20 school to be successful, in fact even if you can, it might not be the best option for you.  The rankings aren't that valuable or reliable anyway because of how and why they are produced and what they mean. After college, no one uses the rankings. Employers hire people, not undergraduate brands.  It's a controversial bomb to drop, but it's the truth. Sure if you want to be on the Supreme Court someday, you probably need a law degree from a top school. But for most of us, mind-blowing levels of success are very attainable almost no matter where we get our education.  You have options.  There are over 4600 degree granting colleges in the United States. Many hundreds of these are great schools offering a world class education and pre-professional training. You might have a list of ~10. Guess what? Even if you go 0-10, you can still go to a great college. There are good colleges with later deadlines or rolling admissions. You can take a gap year. This is not your only shot at an amazing college education.

11.  **Don't give up**.  Once May rolls around, you'll be glad you stuck with it. After your first job out of college, no one will care what your GPA was, what your test scores were, or even where you went to school. Who you are, the work ethic you build, the habits you have, and the relationships you form will have a bigger impact on your future than your SAT, GPA, or really anything from high school or college.  Life is long and being successful in high school and going to college is not a one-shot, winner-take-all, do-or-die affair. If you don't get accepted at ANY of your top schools, or you have a 500 SAT, or a 1.4 GPA, or someone royally screwed you over somehow, or whatever - you can still have a successful life. Almost any failure or circumstance can be overcome later. You almost always have another opportunity to succeed.

12.  **If you're feeling overwhelmed by deadlines, relax**. They will come and go. You'll get your stuff done or you won't. But there will be many other chances to figure things out.

13.  **If it helps, the sensation that you aren't good enough and that you don't know how to handle the pressure and expectations being foisted upon you never really goes away**. [Imposter syndrome is real](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/edyphz/how_to_handle_imposter_syndrome/) and you need to have reasonable expectations for yourself to keep things in perspective both in college and in your career.  No matter what company you go to after graduation, someone will be way more successful than you. If you start your own business, there will be other business owners who are way more successful and distinguished. I'll put it this way - if you think this sub is bad, wait until you become a working professional and get on LinkedIn.  At some point, you have to just set some goals for yourself and define success on your own terms. Then work to achieve what you want out of life without obsessing over what other people are doing. You will be surprised how much better you feel about yourself if you work on yourself for yourself rather than constantly comparing yourself to people who are better than you. (And there is always someone better than you - richer, taller, younger, smarter, sexier, more successful, more accomplished, more talented, more athletic, etc.) But the comparisons do you no good whatsoever. Set your own goals, then go be you.

14.  **Take care of your mental health and recognize that little steps can get you on the right track quickly**.  If you're struggling, get some help.  Talk to a friend, parent, or counselor.  You aren't alone and there are many people going through the same feelings of stress and anxiety.  Life is long.  You *will* make mistakes and suffer failures - that's life.  But you also get **so. many. chances.** to come back from them.  It's never too late.  Ray Kroc started McDonalds at age 59.  Laura Ingalls Wilder wrote "Little House in the Big Woods" at age 65.  You could literally fail out of high school, spend a year in trade school, and be making $80k as a corporate welder in a low cost of living area by age 19 (this happened to a friend of mine who finished high school with a 1.9 GPA).  You could write a hit book like Stephanie Meyer (who started writing Twilight at age 30).  You could start your own successful business like a friend of mine who recently retired with a lake house and a beach house (after being fired or laid off from his first 3 jobs).
