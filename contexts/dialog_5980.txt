CANDY: Hi...
ROSE ROSE: Hi...
CANDY: I've got some more clothes for you-- I just keep forgetting to bring them with me.
ROSE ROSE: I don't need no more clothes, thank you.
CANDY: Rose, I know what's going on. Homer told me. I got pregnant, too--about a year ago. I've been through this.
ROSE ROSE: You ain't been through what I been through, Candy.
CANDY: Yes, I *have*!
