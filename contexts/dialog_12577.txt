JULIE: Your daddy and I are kind of mad at each other right now, so we have to spend some time apart.
HOLLY: Why are you mad at each other?
JULIE: You know how sometimes Neil bugs you and you just get up and walk away from him?
HOLLY: Uh huh.
JULIE: Well, that's what happens with grownups, too.
HOLLY: Did Daddy tease you?
JULIE: Yes, he did, and I don't like it any more than you do.
NEIL: Where'd he go?
JULIE: He's staying with a friend. Hurry up now, you'll be late for school.
HOLLY: Daddy's gone where Rudolf went and isn't coming back!
JULIE: Holly -- that's not so.
