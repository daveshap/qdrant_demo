Temp to Perm Job -- Salary Negotiations
So after many, many posts, and redone resumes, i finally landed with a temp agency on a temp to perm basis as an Executive Assistant/Office Manager. The pay and hours are shit at the moment due to the rate the Agency is charging. It's a small company, so the high rate is putting the squeeze on the bottomline.

That's where my concern comes in. The owner has told me that he absolutely wants to keep me on after the contract ends. However, I was able to take a look at my predecessors last pay stub (after reaching out to her beforehand, of course), and realized that she was getting paid a significantly less amount than I was expecting to get, which was really disheartening.

To be fair, from what I was told, she was very much a bare minimum person: punch in on time, out on time, no initiative (coming from other workers. not the owner). 

So I did some research on what other E.A.s and Office Managers in my area make, and the number in my head is still significantly lower than what my projected number is on salary.com (about $15k more than what I am asking).

I'm wondering if I am selling myself short on a potentially great salary. based on the size of the company, [the task I am doing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mXOCvr1ycouzDKFw5QRr_sdP3A_8SsZTeXHd8JedbrE/edit?usp=sharing) vs. [the tasks they expect](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nH72410TYYYWVxnsemT5VKhXVp3QoNQx6LjTENi-ybk/edit?usp=sharing), and the expectations of the field, should I be asking for more? Should I be prepared to walk away and find something else?

I've never been in a situation where negotiations are available, so this is all very foreign for me.
