SANDY: Oh nice save.
JODY: I was desperate. It was gross.
SANDY: Kenny'll come running back. This is just his way of pressuring you.
JODY: He says he loves me.
SANDY: Personally I think he has a deep, almost pathological desire to corrupt you. But I suppose that's a type of love. I certainly wish someone wanted to corrupt me.
JODY: Maybe I should blister through a bottle of Tequila and just fuck his brains out.
SANDY: No!
JODY: You're the one always saying 'Just do it'.
SANDY: That was before he pulled this 'Dick me or I dump you' shit. I say fuck his best friend.
JODY: I don't know what I'm so scared of.
SANDY: Want to come in for awhile? Log onto AOL, flirt with some married men, head into a private S&M chat room . . .
JODY: How do you know what to type back when they start to cyber with you.
SANDY: I keep a couple of my dad's porno books hidden in my desk for emergency reference.
JODY: I promised I'd go right home after school.
SANDY: OK. increase the peace.
