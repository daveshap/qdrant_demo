How to wire a USA 50amp 2 phase double pole breaker supply for a UK 240v high capacity shower pump I have recently moved to the USA from Scotland. I brought with me a \"Waterfall\" 3 bar shower pump, operating on UK 240V, 50Hz A/C,rated at 4 A, 850W, IPX2.In our house we have a disused 50amp supply in the basement, which used to supply a hotbtub, feeding through a seperate in house double pole circuit breaker, with confirmed red, black, white and earth wires in a 3/4\" cable, for which I have three questions.How do I wire this feed to power the UK shower pump. Can I alternately/in tandem use a single red or black wire to feed a dog grooming room( currently frequently tripping a house 30amp supply) running 2 x 17 amp, 115v dog dryers, plus an 115v air conditioner rated at 10.8 amps/1200W. Total amps = 44.8 A.Ideally I would like to run both the 240V shower and 115v dog grooming room from the same supply, not simultaneously,  complying with USA electrical code. Thank you in anticipation of any replies. Roy.
