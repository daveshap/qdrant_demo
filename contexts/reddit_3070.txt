How do they expect you to have experience when you cannot even land a "graduate" or "entry" position?
I was recently let go from my previous position as a Marketing Assistant. There were a lot of underlying issues between myself and my manager and before I could resign, they let me go (I was still under probationary terms). I've been unemployed for 6 weeks, and my previous work experience is not clearly the best with a lot of changes, but how do you even go through the first initial application process before getting the standard generalised "unsuccessful" email. I've been through so many interviews, met a few recruiters who would claim to 'help me out' and its stressing me out on how people think. 

I have 8 years of QSR (quick service restuarant) experience on hand and 2 years of Media/Marketing on hand. I really do want to steer away from the QSR industry and put myself into media/marketing, yet it still isn't enough to even get an entry or graduate level. 

Anyone else in my shoes? How do you battle the loss of confidence?
