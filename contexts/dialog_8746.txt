MILLER: You have something, Dr. Weir?
WEIR: The date.
MILLER: What about it?
WEIR: The Event Horizon's computer think's it's 2034.
MILLER: It's 2041...
WEIR: Exactly. The ship's internal clock is off by seven years.
STARCK: Maybe a power interruption crashed the system...
WEIR: No, there's no evidence of a surge or spike of any kind. It's as if time just... stopped for seven years.
MILLER: Explanation?
WEIR: Intense gravitational fields effect the passage of time, it's possible... Black holes make sense on paper, it's all math, you see, but as to what really happened... The Event Horizon has passed beyond our plane of reality, and like Lazarus, returned from the dead.
