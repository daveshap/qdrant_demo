LILLY: You don't know what I'd do, Roy. You have no idea. To live.
ROY: Oh, you'll live, Lilly.
LILLY: I know what's bugging you, of course.
ROY: Oh? I didn't know anything was.
LILLY: Oh, really? You've got a legitimate complaint, Roy, I don't deny that. I wasn't a very good mother when you were a kid.
ROY: Not very good!
LILLY: A bad mother. By any standards. I've thought about it, you know, from your side, since then. I know just how bad I was.
ROY: Uh-huh.
LILLY: I wonder did you ever think about it from my side.
ROY: Never.
LILLY: No, I guess not. It was pretty lousy of me, I guess, to be a child at the same time you were. Not to stop being a child just because I had a child. I guess I was a real stinker not to be a grown-up when you needed a grown-up.
ROY: What do you want me to do? Pin a halo on you? You're doing a pretty good job of that yourself.
LILLY: And making you feel bad at the same time, huh? But that's the way I am, you know, the way I've always been. Always picking on poor little Roy.
ROY: For God's sake, Lilly!
LILLY: I gave you your life twice. I'm asking you to give me mine once. I need the money.
ROY: No.
LILLY: You're getting off the grift?
ROY: That's right.
LILLY: That's good. You don't really belong on this side of the fence, you know.
ROY: I don't?
LILLY: If you stayed a crook, do you think you'd live to be my ripe age?
ROY: I don't see why not.
LILLY: Well, I guess I got it wrong, then. Seems to me I heard about a guy just your age that got hit so hard in the guts it almost killed him.
ROY: Well, uh...
LILLY: Sure, sure, that doesn't count. That's different.
ROY: Well, it doesn't matter, does it? I'm getting out.
LILLY: And that's why you've got to get rid of this money. If you keep it around, it'll just make you think how clever you are. It'll be a temptation to get back into the game.
ROY: Oh, that's it! You're stealing my money for my own good! How very motherly of you, Lilly.
