If you see this, you better have a good fucking day!
And always remember, fuck anxiety, it’s all energy! Embrace it!


Edit: first silver ever!  Thanks kind stranger. 

I suffer from anxiety all the time. As I’ve gotten older I try to focus on the anxiety as energy moving throughout my body.  If I have anxiety and I feel it in my stomach, I zone in on how my stomach is feeling, pay attention to the anxiety moving throughout my body and it helps to relieve it eventually, don’t ignore it as it’s there for your attention, something about your mental thinking or the physical world is causing this energy to enter your body, find out what it is, pay attention, don’t ignore it.
