CHARLIE: Can't make a buck without my leopard. I tell you, Mr. Manning, you gotta find that cat for me -- or pay up.
JERRY: Look, Charlie, just be patient. I'll fix everything. You don't want that cat, anyway. It killed two people.
CHARLIE: No, sir. That girl in the cemetery? My cat didn't kill that girl. I told you cats don't go around looking for trouble. If that cat's alive, it's out in the country hiding under a bush, starving to death.
JERRY: You really think so, Charlie?
CHARLIE: That cat ain't mean. I feed him out of my own hand for six years. Why don't he kill me? At night in the truck, I let him out of the cage. When I am falling asleep I hear him walking back and forth. I go to sleep. He don't hurt me.
JERRY: They all say the cat killed this second girl.
CHARLIE: They don't say it to me.
JERRY: I'd like one of them to say it to you, Charlie. I'd like to have you hear his side of it his reasons. Want to hear them?
CHARLIE: Sure.
JERRY: Let's get in your truck.
CHARLIE: Where's that man?
JERRY: Up at the museum.
