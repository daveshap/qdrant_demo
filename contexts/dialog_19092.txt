JOSEPHINE: Ah, my dear Madame de Montesquiou, you have no idea what happiness it brings me to see this child, at last. I was told the very idea of such a visit would too much distress the Empress.
MONTESQUIOU: I am delighted to be of service to you again, Your Highness. And I can tell you, my instructions came directly from the Emperor, with a caution to be discreet.
JOSEPHINE: Oh... I see. I understand. How is... the Emperor?
MONTESQUIOU: I rarely see him, Your Highness, but I believe he is in excellent health, and he is very happy with the child.
JOSEPHINE: Ah, that is good.
MONTESQUIOU: And, you seem in excellent health, Your Highness.
JOSEPHINE: Ah, well, my dear Madame de Montesquiou, peace of mind can eventually be a substitute for happiness.
