CAROL: Stop it!! Why can't I have a normal boyfriend??? Why? Get out of here. Just a regular boyfriend who doesn't go nuts on me...
BEVERLY: Everybody wants that, dear -- it doesn't exit... Sorry... didn't mean to interrupt.
MELVIN: Boyfriend?
CAROL: Oh, come on in and try not to ruin everything by being you.
MELVIN: Maybe we could live without the wise cracks.
