HEYWARD: What the bloody hell plan is this?
HAWKEYE: In this there is a chance. If I live, I can try to free you. If we don't go, there is no powder, there's too many of them. Though my heart would keep me here, in that there is no chance. None. I can do nothing. Do you understand?
CORA: Yes. I want you to go.
