BORG QUEEN: They're not your friends... they've held you back... kept you from your destiny...
DATA: That is not true. They have tried to help me.
BORG QUEEN: Have they given you what I have given you? Did they even try?

BORG QUEEN: You're becoming more human all the time, Data. Now you're learning how to lie.
DATA: I wish to... go back to the way I was.
BORG QUEEN: More lies.
BORG QUEEN: Have you ever know a woman? Do you know what it's like to feel her breath on your face... her skin against yours... flesh against flesh?
DATA: My creator did not intend for me to experience these things.
BORG QUEEN: I'm your creator now.
WORF: You will have to realign the targeting array of the quantum torpedo... and reprogram the warhead for the localized detonation. There's only one torpedo left...

WORF: The Borg will undoubtedly attack. Set phasers to rotating modulation.
