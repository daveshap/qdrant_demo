FRANK: That's a hell of a swing you got there, Noel. I'm thinking Strawberry in his prime.
NOEL: Strawberry ain't shit. Drug pussy. Me. I swing like Reggie. Mr. October. Number three, game six, World Series.
NOEL: Here, you try.
FRANK: No, I'd better not.
NOEL: Sure, sure, give go.
FRANK: Yeah?
FRANK: What the hell. The next year, tiebreaker for the division, in Boston, Yanks down two to nothing, Bucky Dent steps to the plate.
NOEL: Oh man, Bucky.
FRANK: The pitch, high heater. Bucky knows what's coming. He steps in, smash, over the green monster.
