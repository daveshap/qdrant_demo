HAROLD: Give me that Goddamn thing! Now get out of here, or I might kill you. Who knows?
PENELOPE: You've killed women?
HAROLD: Seventeen of them--eleven by accident. March! Move! You, too!
PENELOPE: Norbert--you come, too. Let him go, Harold. Let him go.
HAROLD: Of course he can go--if he'll just go down on his hands and knees for a moment--and promise me that he does not find me comical in the least degree.
PENELOPE: Do it, Norbert.
WOODLY: Hands and knees, you say?
HAROLD: And terror, if you don't mind.
PENELOPE: Do it!
WOODLY: Goodbye.
