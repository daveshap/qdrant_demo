THEO: Don't worry, I probably won't be in here much. Light sleeper.
NELL: That's why we're here.
THEO: What do you do?
NELL: I'm between jobs right now. My last job... it... the person I was working for... the job ended. Over. So... And you?
THEO: That depends.
NELL: Not really.
THEO: Don't tell me Boston is different from New York.
NELL: Ohh, sure, you have trouble with commitment.
THEO: My boyfriend thinks so, my girlfriend doesn't. If we could all live together... but... they hate each other. It's hard to be Miss Perversity when you're the only one at the party. D'you know what I mean?
NELL: No.
THEO: A blank canvas! I could paint your portrait, directly on you. Or maybe not. So, you? Husbands? Boyfriends? Girlfriends? Where do you live?
NELL: I don't have anyone. But I do have a little apartment of my own. It has a little flower garden. You can just see the ocean. At night, when the wind comes in just right, you can hear the buoys in the harbor.
