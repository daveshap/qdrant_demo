When to tell potential employer about vacation?
I’m currently looking for a new job (looking since December). I am getting married in October and already asked off two weeks for wedding + honeymoon. 

As I’m continuing the job search, should I tell potential employer about it during the interview stage or negotiating stage. I don’t want them to say no to it (because I can’t move my wedding or travel plans at this point) but I also don’t want them to say no because I’ll be gone for two weeks.

Thoughts? Advice?
