MULDER: Unmarked tanker trucks... what are archaeologists hauling out in tanker trucks?
SCULLY: I don't know, Mulder.
MULDER: And where are they going with it?
SCULLY: That's the first question to answer, if we're going to find them.
MULDER: What are my choices?
SCULLY: About a hundred miles of nothing in each direction.
MULDER: Where would they be going?
SCULLY: We've got two choices. One of them is wrong.
MULDER: You think they went left?
SCULLY: I don't know why I think they went right.
