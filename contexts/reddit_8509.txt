Democrats have introduced their long expected "Green New Deal." Now that the plan is public, what's in it? How does it plan to accomplish its lofty goals, including getting the U.S. carbon neutral by 2030?
On Thursday, [House Democrats introduced](https://www.apnews.com/385ab89f01024aa99e64c5cdb97f0d16) a long [expected bill](https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/12/21/18144138/green-new-deal-alexandria-ocasio-cortez), commonly referred to as the Green New Deal.

Formally called *Recognizing the duty of the Federal Government to create a Green New Deal*, it can be found in several places in full - [here it is hosted by NPR](https://apps.npr.org/documents/document.html?id=5729033-Green-New-Deal-FINAL) (PDF warning). I was unable to find it hosted by Congress at this time.

It has [ambitions goals](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/07/climate/green-new-deal.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage), including getting the United States carbon neutral by 2030, eradicating poverty, and creating millions of "green jobs".

I have a couple of questions:

1: What is the substance of the Green New Deal? What measures does it call for to reduce carbon output, create jobs, and reduce or eradicate poverty? What other goals does the legislation have?

2: What data is being used to demonstrate that these measures will accomplish these goals?

Bonus weird side question: This current House Resolution is unnumbered, but is this HR1? Is the numbering system just the order in which bills are submitted?
