KIRK: I really must thank you.
SULU: I am delighted; any chance to go aboard Enterprise, however briefly, is always an excuse for nostalgia.
KIRK: I cut your new orders personally. By the end of the month, you'll have your first command: USS EXCELSIOR.
SULU: Thank you, sir. I've looked forward to this for a long time.
KIRK: You've earned it. But I'm still grateful to have you at the helm for three weeks. I don't believe these kids can steer.
