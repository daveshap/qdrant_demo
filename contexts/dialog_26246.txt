NORMA: How much will it be? I warn you - don't give me a fancy price just because I'm rich.
GILLIS: Lady. you've got the wrong man.
GILLIS: I had some trouble with my car. Flat tire. I pulled into your garage till I could get a spare. I thought this was an empty house.
NORMA: It is not. Get out.
GILLIS: I'm sorry, and I'm sorry you lost your friend, and I don't think red is the right color.
NORMA: Get out.
GILLIS: Sure. Wait a minute -- haven't I seen you -- ?
NORMA: Or shall I call my servant?
GILLIS: I know your face. You're Norma Desmond. You used to be in pictures. You used to be big.
NORMA: I am big. It's the pictures that got small.
GILLIS: I knew there was something wrong with them.
NORMA: They're dead. They're finished. There was a time when this busi- ness had the eyes of the whole wide world. But that wasn't good enough. Oh, nol They wanted the ears of the world, too. So they opened their big mouths, and out came talk, talk, talk...
GILLIS: That's where the popcorn business comes in. You buy yourself a bag and plug up your ears.
NORMA: Look at them in the front offices -- the master minds! They took the idols and smashed them. The Fairbankses and the Chaplins and the Gilberts and the Valentinos. And who have they got now? Some nobodies -- a lot of pale little frogs croaking pish-poshl
GILLIS: Don't get sore at me. I'm not an executive. I'm just a writer.
NORMA: You are! Writing words, words! You've made a rope of words and strangled this businessl But there is a microphone right there to catch the last gurgles, and Technicolor to photograph the red, swollen tongue!
GILLIS: Ssh! You'll wake up that monkey.
NORMA: Get out!
