GASTON: And you, M'sieu Giron, seem to be disturbing my examination of <u>this</u> <u>report</u>.
GIRON: Examination! M'sieu Laval, what are you insinuating? I have enjoyed the confidence of this family for more than forty years. How long have you enjoyed Madame's confidence? Three weeks, I believe.
GASTON: Two weeks and three days.
GIRON: Um-hum!
GASTON: Are <u>you</u> insinuating anything, M'sieu Giron?
GIRON: No, not at all!
GASTON: Well, that's fine. Then you are not insinuating that I am avoiding questions. And I am not insinuating that you won't let me examine this report.
GIRON: I was only asking if you are related to the Lavals of Marseilles.
GASTON: And I was only asking you if you would let me examine your report without interruption.
GIRON: I don't see why any man should get excited when he is asked about his hometown.
GASTON: And I don't see any reason for any man getting nervous when somebody checks over the figures of his report.
GIRON: Are you insinuating that this is not an honest report?
GASTON: I am only insinuating that you are nervous.
GIRON: Nervous! Why should I be nervous?
GASTON: I don't <u>know</u>, M'sieu Giron!
