My unemployed brother is destroying my mother's life.
So my 63 year old mother just got out of the hospital. She recently had to have surgery to remove 6 inches of colon due to a blockage. As if this didn't make her life hard enough, she comes home to find out that her son has taken all the money out of her bank account and then some. She is currently overdrawn, thanks to him. She's already poor and trying to live off of Social Security. But now she has less than no money.

My problem is that I live in another state. I feel like I should try to help her in some way but I'm not sure how. My brother has been leeching money from her since my dad passed away in 2012. He's stolen every piece of jewelry or anything of value that she owns. This includes my dead father's wedding ring. I just don't know how to help her if she won't help herself. She won't send him away. She says she needs him to run errands for her because she's usually too sick to do it on her own. (She has chronic intestinal issues.) However, this means she's putting her debit card into his greedy little hands. Not only is she pretty much setting herself up for theft but she's bailed him out of jail twice.

Would I be able to help her if I lived nearby? I wouldn't mind running errands for her or helping out around the house. Would moving back mean letting him ruin my own life? I'm not afraid to stand up to him. At the moment, I live with my long-term boyfriend who hates my brother's guts and is convinced he'll move on to trying to get money from us if we were to move back.  I feel helpless. I'm just at a loss of what to do. I feel like I owe my mom whatever protection and help I can offer. Yet, should I sacrifice my own happiness for her?
