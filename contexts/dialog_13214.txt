JOEY: Kirsty Cotton. Yes. But ... if your soul was freed, why are you back?
ELLIOTT: Because - monster as I was - I was bound by Laws. The protocol of Hell. The Box had to be opened to let me out. The truly innocent were safe. That's no longer true. The shell of the beast has been fleshed. What I was is out there, Joey. In your world. Unbound. Unstoppable.
JOEY: What will he do? What does he want?
ELLIOTT: He'll do what he does best. But he'll do it unfettered. He wants to walk the Earth forever, indulging his taste for all the myriad subtleties of human suffering.
JOEY: What can we do?
ELLIOTT: I like you, Joey. You ask all the right questions. There is something we can do but it will require great courage.
JOEY: I don't know ...
ELLIOTT: Joey, you walked through your window from one reality to another. You're stronger than you think.
JOEY: Then tell me what to do.
ELLIOTT: This is his first night on Earth. He wants to close the door behind him. Like all Lieutenants, he covets command. There's a gateway to Hell through which he can be taken back. He has to destroy it.
JOEY: So where is it?
ELLIOTT: Your apartment.
JOEY: Wha .... ?
ELLIOTT: The Box, Joey. He wants the Box.
