BUD: Are you Pierce Patchett?
PATCHETT: I am. Are you soliciting for police charities? The last time, you people called at my office.
BUD: I'm a homicide detective. Where were you last night?
PATCHETT: I was here, hosting a party. Who was killed and why do you think I can help?
BUD: Richard Stensland.
PATCHETT: I don't know him. Mr...
BUD: Officer White. How about Susan Lefferts? You know her?
PATCHETT: You know I do or you wouldn't be here. How did you find me?
BUD: We met outside Hollywood Liquors on Christmas Eve. This is where Lynn Bracken's booze bills go.
PATCHETT: Of course...
BUD: Sue Lefferts died at the Nite Owl. I'm investigating.
