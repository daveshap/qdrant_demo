INIGO: Slow going?
MAN IN BLACK: Look, I don't mean to be rude, but this is not as easy as it looks. So I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't distract me.
INIGO: Sorry.
MAN IN BLACK: Thank you.
INIGO: I do not suppose you could speed things up?
MAN IN BLACK: If you're in such a hurry, you could lower a rope, or a tree branch, or find something useful to do. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 26.
INIGO: I could do that. In fact, I've got some rope up here. But I do not think that you will accept my help, since I am only waiting around to kill you.
MAN IN BLACK: That does put a damper on our relationship.
INIGO: But I promise I will not kill you until you reach the top.
MAN IN BLACK: That's very comforting. But I'm afraid you'll just have to wait.
INIGO: I hate waiting. I could give you my word as a Spaniard.
MAN IN BLACK: No good. I've known too many Spaniards.
INIGO: You don't know any way you'll trust me?
MAN IN BLACK: Nothing comes to mind.
