HELEN: What is it you want?
KLAATU: Before I ask you to be honest with me, perhaps I should be completely honest with you--
HELEN: What happened?
KLAATU: What time is it?
HELEN: Just twelve.
KLAATU: We'll be stuck here for a little while -- about thirty minutes.
HELEN: We could try pushing the other buttons. I have a flashlight in my purse.
KLAATU: It won't work.
HELEN: Why not?
KLAATU: You see -- the electricity's been neutralized -- all over the world.
