My kitten died this morning
My cat got pregnant and had two kittens. One was going to live with my friend, and one we decided to keep. She was a runt, her spine was crooked and she was gray and white with a gray smiley joker face on her back, and was the sweetest thing. We named her Lucy-fur, and she was the only cat my fiancé liked. My kids adored her, I adored her, she was just the coolest kitten. After some initial concerns, she started to eat, she ran around and played, she was growing and seemed to be doing great. This morning my fiancé let me sleep in, he was in the living room with my daughters and heard this yowling sound. He walked into the kitchen and found Lucy laying on the ground yowling and breathing hard, he ran to wake me up and told me something was wrong with her. I sat with her for a second and went to grab a towel to wrap her in so we could rush her to the vet. I got back with the towel, laid it on the ground and she took her last breath. My fiancé and my five year old were crying, and I had to wake my son up to tell him. Her mom sat there and licked her for several minutes, trying to wake her up. 

She was only three months old. My fiancé just sat next to her, petting her and crying. I was sobbing, calling my mom to see if she had a box we could bury Lucy in. 

We buried her and planted wild flower seeds over her grave. My eight year old made a cross out of sticks, my son is the one who placed her in the ground. My other cat is acting lost, she keeps walking around meowing, like she's looking for her daughter. 

I know she was young, but we all really bonded with her. She loved to cuddle, always came running to you when you walked in the door, would sit on your foot and meow until you picked her up. Anyone who came over instantly fell in love with her. She made a huge impact in her short life, and there are five grieving people. 

Rest in peace, Lucy-Fur. You'll be missed.
