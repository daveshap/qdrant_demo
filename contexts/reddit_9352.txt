If you’re on the verge of homelessness, get a gym membership.
This may seem counter intuitive but if you find yourself unable to pay for rent and almost on the street, a gym membership will allow you to use a shower, a locker to put in your stuff, water and free WiFi. 

Planet fitness is my personal favorite because they’re often 24/7 so you can do this at times with lower traffic and they also serve pizza and bagels at times. 

Also: if you’re struggling with finding a job and need one immediately, look into pizzerias or local family owned businesses. A lot of them pay under the table, have a high turnover rate so they’re likely looking for people, don’t have the long and drawn out hiring processes and you’re more likely to talk directly to the owner. 



Edit: wow everyone, I was not expecting this much feedback but I’m glad other people have used this tip as well. Granted, it depends on where you are and how the gyms in your area function but a little research and calling can go a long way to make sure you at least have a place to shower. 

Edit 2: as someone mentioned (thank you for that) just because the place pays under the table, it does not mean you shouldn’t pay taxes. Put some of the money aside once you have enough to eat to pay in April. Not only is that fraud (uhm.... duh) but it can bite you in the ass down the line. A lot of places will ask for previous years’ tax returns and you do not want to have that hole in your tax history. Even if the IRS deals with bigger money, it does not mean that you should try to sneak by. Thanks again for that heads up.
