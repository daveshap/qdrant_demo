Is there a way to define 26mV thermal voltage with simple words This 26mV thermal voltage at room temperature is used in non-linear diode equation.I tried to learn about it to see what it means without getting involved in too much physics but failed to find a simple explanation.Is there a way to describe it without involving in too much theory and background?Is this just a number that fits the empirical results like a constant?
