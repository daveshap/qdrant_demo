Help getting a job
How do I get a job without an ID, I didn’t apply for one before all the dmv’s in my county closed(Los Angeles) I’ve called government offices here and they all say they never thought about it. I’m 18 and have my ssn but no passport with current photo or ID card. Is there any place that would hire me with my ssn and birth certificate?
