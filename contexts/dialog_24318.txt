PAUL: I didn't expect to see you again.
RASHID: Same here. But I had a long talk with my accountant this afternoon. You know, to see how a move like this would affect my tax picture, and he said it would be okay.
PAUL: That's it. Just the two rooms.
RASHID: This is the first house I've been in without a TV.
PAUL: I used to have one, but it broke a couple of years ago and I never got around to replacing it. I'd just as soon not have one anyway. I hate those damn things.
RASHID: But then you don't get to watch the ball games. You told me you were a Mets fan.
PAUL: I listen on the radio. I can see the games just fine that way. The world is in your head, remember?
RASHID: Nice drawing. Did you do that?
PAUL: My father did. Believe it or not, that little baby is me.
RASHID: Yeah, I can believe it.
PAUL: It's strange, though, isn't it? Looking at yourself before you knew who you were.
RASHID: Is your father an artist?
PAUL: No, he was a schoolteacher. But he liked to dabble.
RASHID: He's dead?
PAUL: Twelve, thirteen years ago. Actually, he died with his sketch pad open on his lap. Up in the Berkshires one weekend, drawing a picture of Mount Greylock.
RASHID: Drawing's a good thing.
PAUL: Is that what you do? Draw pictures?
RASHID: Yeah, sometimes. I like to dabble, too.
PAUL: Time to wake up. Hey, kid, time to wake up. Rashid! Up and out. I have to work in here. The slumber party is over.
RASHID: What time is it?
PAUL: Eight-thirty.
RASHID: Eight-thirty?
PAUL: You'll find juice and eggs and milk in the refrigerator. Cereal in the cupboard. Coffee on the stove. Take whatever you want. But it's time for me to get started in here.
