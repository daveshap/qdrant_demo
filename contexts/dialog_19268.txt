CASE: I know who you are.
JULIUS/WINTERMUTE: There's no call for violence. I've simply accessed your memory for a spokesperson. You use that gun and it will only create another inconvenient interruption. You see, you've been avoiding me, Case.
JULIUS/WINTERMUTE: And we really do have to talk.
CASE: You set me up from the beginning. It was you that got Julius killed.
JULIUS/WINTERMUTE: I had to limit your options.
CASE: And Linda...
JULIUS/WINTERMUTE: You know why Linda's dead. She loved you and you let her down. It's that simple. Of course I did instigate certain events. Calculated the variables. I found her to be... expendable.
CASE: I'm gonna burn you to the ground, you son of a bitch.
JULIUS/WINTERMUTE: Excellent. That's exactly what I had in mind. But if you're going to kill me, we have to work together, old son. I'm no pushover, you know.
CASE: Shut down your ice patterns. I'll take you out.
JULIUS/WINTERMUTE: I can no more shut down my own natural defences that you can stop breathing. That's why I need you, Case. You're the only person alive who has a chance of penetrating my defences. My ice" as you call it. I'm doing everything I can to make that possible."
CASE: Why would you want me to kill you?
JULIUS/WINTERMUTE: Let's just say we have a destiny to fulfil, you and I.
CASE: I think you're full of shit.
JULIUS/WINTERMUTE: No, It's you that is full of shit. And blood. And bones. A typically imperfect organic being. You've been hopelessly predictable all along, but you're going to have to do better than that now.
