BYRON: Don't be pissed. I'm on your side, Pard. I just don't want you to do something you'll regret. You gotta give six years to the Navy if you wanna fly... that's six years with the most uptight assholes God put on this earth. Officers aren't like you and me, man. It's another breed.
ZACK: You afraid you'll have to salute me, Chief?
BYRON: Fuck, no! Why would I care about something as dumb as that?
ZACK: I don't know. That's just how it sounded. Well, I'll see you.
BYRON: Hey, what did you want? A lot of fatherly bullshit? A big pat on the back?
ZACK: From you, pard? Never. Thanks for the graduation present.
BYRON: Hey, Zackie -- don't go away mad.
