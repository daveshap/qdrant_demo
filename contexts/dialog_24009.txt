MAX: It's bogus. You used an old library shot for the background.
VIKTOR: The background is.
MAX: She was never in New Mexico. She never left the studio.
MAX: I've done my homework. I've studied her.
VIKTOR: -- I bet you have.
MAX: -- I've looked at every piece of publicity she's ever done, the video in the supermarket, there's no evidence she's ever left the studio. Oh, and for some reason this woman leaves no paper trail. But I have obtained" a copy of your bank accounts. I know you have power of attorney but so far you haven't transferred one single solitary cent to her."
VIKTOR: I'm keeping it in trust.
MAX: I know that's what you'd like us to believe. But I got to tell you -- embezzlement is a serious matter. Not to mention abduction.
VIKTOR: Abduction?
MAX: I don't buy the whole recluse scam. How are you doing it? What is it -- drugs? Blackmail? Mind-control? All three? What do you do -- keep her locked in a box somewhere?
VIKTOR: What is it exactly you want, Sayer?
MAX: I want to see her. Unless you show me Simone live and in person I show these pictures to the authorities.
VIKTOR: Alright, Sayer, you've got a deal.
MAX: Er,... good.
