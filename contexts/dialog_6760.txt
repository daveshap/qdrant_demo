MATT: Where do you live, Jack?
JACK: Over the river.
MATT: Have you got transport?
MATT: I'm going over the river. I'll give you a lift if you like.
JACK: Thanks.
MATT: So how do you feel, your first night? I'll bet you're on a high.
JACK: Nice car.
MATT: She's my baby.
JACK: How long have you worked at the casino?
MATT: Coming up to two years now. But I was away for six months.
JACK: You've done pretty well.
MATT: Not bad. I have other interests, of course.
MATT: I'm off to a little watering hole. Why don't you join me? Relax.
JACK: No thanks, Matt. I need my eight hours.
MATT: I'll lay you five to one you won't sleep. In this job you have to unwind. Otherwise it'll kill you. I mean that.
JACK: Some other time.
MARION: What's the time?
JACK: I don't know.
MARION: How did it go?
JACK: Fine.
MARION: You're shaking. What is it?
JACK: Tension. It'll go.
MARION: Poor baby. This'll relax you.
MARION: I loved it blond.
JACK: It's only hair. I haven't changed.
MARION: When you get home, I'm asleep. When I leave home, you're asleep.
JACK: I'll see you in my dreams.
