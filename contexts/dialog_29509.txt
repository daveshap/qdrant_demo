KIRK: What is it? You look like you've seen a ghost.
SPOCK: Perhaps I have, Captain. Perhaps I have.
KIRK: Spock, what is it? Do you know this Vulcan?
SPOCK: I cannot be certain.
KIRK: But he does seem familiar?
SPOCK: He reminds me of someone I knew in my youth.
SPOCK: I do not often think of the past.
KIRK: Who is it he reminds you of?
SPOCK: There was a young student, exceptionally gifted, possessing of great intelligence. It was assumed that one day he would take his place amongst the great scholars of Vulcan. But he was a revolutionary.
KIRK: What do you mean?
SPOCK: The knowledge and experience he sought were forbidden by Vulcan belief.
SPOCK: He rejected his logical upbringing and embraced the animal passions of our ancestors.
KIRK: Why?
SPOCK: He believed the key to self-knowledge was emotion, not logic.
SPOCK: When he encouraged others to follow him, he was banished from Vulcan, never to return.
KIRK: Fascinating.
