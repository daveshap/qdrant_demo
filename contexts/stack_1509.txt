Modify my old (1978) car's existing dash light dimmer (10 ohm Rheostat) to control LED replacement globes Firstly my electronics knowledge is limited.I am trying to work out a way to use the existing Rheostat (10 ohm) that is used to dim the instrument lights in my 1978 car. I have changed the globes to 12V dimmable LEDs, but the voltage drop on the dimmer is not sufficient to dim the LEDs. I have tested the LEDs and they are turned off at about 4.5V and are almost at full brightness at 10V.I could use a PWM device with a different trimpot, but I would like to use the existing dimmer switch. I thought maybe an Op amp with a 800mA transistor on the output might work, but I am struggling with that concept. Any ideas or available modification circuitry available?Thanks.
