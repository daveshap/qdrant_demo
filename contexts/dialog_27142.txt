DR. ZIEWZIC: What are we talking about here?
PENDERGAST: Someone who makes the Hacksaw Murderer look like Mother Teresa.
DR. ZIEWZIC: Right. The entire brain appears to have been extracted. May I see it, please?
DR. ZIEWZIC: Curious. There's something missing.
PENDERGAST: The thalamus and the hypothalamus, perhaps?
DR. ZIEWZIC: Yes. Two organs the size of a walnut have been removed with what looks like surgical precision.
D'AGOSTA: What happened to them?
PENDERGAST: If you don't mind a suggestion, you might try a saliva test.
D'AGOSTA: Saliva test? You mean, you think someone ate part of the brain?
PENDERGAST: Correct.
