MOBSTER: Clay Bertrand? Sure I know him. He comes around the Quarter.
BILL: Who is he, Joe? I've been to every bar, no one wants to talk.
MOBSTER: I told your uncle I never met a lawman who wasn't a punk. You too, Bill, even if you're family. He's a big shot businessman. I seen him on the TV news a lot with all the other big shots. A fag, you know. Goes by another name down here.
BILL: What's the other name?
MOBSTER: Shaw. Clay Shaw.
BILL: Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw? The guy who used to run the International Trade Mart?
MOBSTER: Yeah, what's the big mystery? Everybody down here knows the guy.
BILL: So why does he call himself Bertrand?
MOBSTER: Who gives a shit what he calls himself?
SUSIE: ...now it gets positively spooky. In January, 1961 - in New Orleans, at the Bolton Ford Dealership - when the Oswald we know is in Russia - there is a man using the name Oswald" to buy trucks for the Friends of Democratic Cuba. The salesman never saw him again
JIM: Goddamn! They put Oswald together from Day One! Like some dummy corporation in the Bahamas - you just move him around a board. Sent him to Russia, in and out, no passport problems. You got the word microdots" in his notebook
