BEN: So where are you?
JACKIE: Right here. Right here. <u>Inside</u> the magician. Shhhh.
BEN: Can I talk to you? When you're there.
JACKIE: Always. Always. And you won't hear a voice. But in <u>here</u>. You'll know. What I'm saying.
BEN: It's not good enough.
JACKIE: No, it isn't. Because it isn't everything. And we want every- thing, don't we?
