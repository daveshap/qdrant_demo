I'm fine on most days but when loneliness hits me, it hits hard.
Damn, it really sucks to be alone when you're craving to hold someone, waking up with someone next to you, someone to make love to, someone to have deep conversations with, someone you know you would go to hell and back for. I feel like have so much love to give but there's no one I can give it to. I could lie to myself and say I'm this independent woman that's strong and doesn't need anyone, and it's not like I'm not, but deep down it's another story. I just miss loving someone.
