My girlfriend is always depressed
She has anxiety issues and takes medication for it. Every time I see her, she mopes and will not talk about what's on her mind. We quit drinking, because she can't without having a mental breakdown. The quarantine has only made things worse. A few weeks ago, she was depressed about not having her own place, for her and her kid. Now, she is depressed about living alone. I know she can't help it, but it's starting to takes it's toll on me. Not sure I can handle much more.

Anyway, thanks for reading. Just needed to get it off my chest.
