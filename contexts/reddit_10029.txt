Can I Pick Your Brain?
Hi everyone, and thanks in advance for reading and responding.  I'm a financial educator who is considering specializing in young adults/collegians.  Unfortunately, most collegians have no money :)  It has occurred to me that the people who have the funds are often the collegiate organizations, such as sports teams, departments, social organizations, etc.  I'm concept testing a financial education program that would be brought to the group/school by the "grown ups."  Do you see a need for financial education in higher education?   In your experience, is this the type of thing that your school would support?  Is there a better way to find the people with the checkbook power, or is it very different at each school?

Thanks for helping support students - you do an important job and as a parent, I appreciate it!
