HELP! promotional Agency has ridiculous policies. Any advice would be appreciated
I work for a promotional agency in London, UK as a 'Brand Ambassador' (fancy way of saying 'twat who hands out leaflets in the street') they advertise shifts on their web portal and 'employees' apply

I have queries/complaints and am unsure if they're legitimate or not. Number 1 is the one that really grates me

1. **Pay**

The company I work for does not process our payslips- in order for us to have our payslips and tax deducted, we have to pay an external payroll company 10% from our own wages (capped at £70 a month) this is something that really annoys me as another colleague who works fewer hours, will pay less to get their payslip even though they're getting the same service.

a)is this legal/allowed and am i technically ''employed'' or ''self employed''?

b) can I claim this payment back as an expense?

c) isnt this the agencies responsibility?

2)**Breaks**

The company enforces a no breaks policy for shifts which are less than 6 hours. story time: I was working a shift from 11:30am-6:30pm, from 11:30-3 I was standing in heavy rain (wearing only a branded t-shirt and trousers with an umbrella) I had not ONCE left my spot to go to the bathroom or sat down. 2 of my colleagues went on a lunch break and a 3rd went to the toilet. the client then comes out and sees me stretching and calls the CEO of the company, who comes down and tells me ''the client says that you're doing \*\*\*\* all'' obviously stunned, I didnt say anything but was seething for the rest of the day-and wrote a strongly worded message to my manager (diplomatically saying that the CEO is a idiot)

I have also had to take a drinks break in the past as i was feeling lightheaded and close to the point of fainting, and had a staff checker saying its not allowed.

&#x200B;

3) **cancellation/returning items**\- the company also enforces a policy where if you're unable to attend a shift (e.g illness), you'll be fined £60, however, if you give enough notice that you'll be unable to attend because of an interview/hospital appointment, along with failure to return items-such as branded t-shirts/leaflets

Again- is this allowed, to be fined for being unable to work because of an illness?

A manager has asked me to write a review on social media about how ''great'' it is to work there- if I actually wrote how I feel, can they fire me/claim unfair dismissal?
