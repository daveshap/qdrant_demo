Was invited for an interview for a remote job
As a Technical Write for Emerson Croft, though it is remote. They sent an overview of what to expect and on of the things that raised red flags for me is:  

They don't have a an immediate need in creating a website for that part of the US or becoming public.  

They don't have "Employees", they have "Consultants".  

Not list the company on any social media (even though a friend who works for the affiliate in out country can do it.  

The contract doesn't include social security, paid vacation or sickness leaves, nor it includes medical care coverage.  

Employees are solely responsible for making all the necessary tax payments that his country's legislation requires them to.  

Is it a scam? Seems pretty legit, but it's weird how they don't offer medical insurance.  

Any advice?
