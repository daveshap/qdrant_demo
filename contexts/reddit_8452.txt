I am a young, male, child-free, white-collar professional who lives and works in Illinois. Assuming the worst for this state's budget situation, in what ways can I personally be affected?
Asking here because I don't have a thorough understanding of Illinois governmental functions. Things such as entitlements, pensions, education, and the lottery do not affect me personally. Roads will continue their current state of being less than stellar, but as of now it doesn't make or break day-to-day life for me.

If income taxes or property taxes go up significantly, that would affect me, but I have no idea what scale of an increase we could be potentially facing. Have there been any sources on how much of an increase we could potentially face?  Are there any other state provided services that I'm not considering?
