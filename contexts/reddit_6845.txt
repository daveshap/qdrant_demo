Can severance be negotiated? (CA)
I was laid off recently due to company restructuring, and I am dissatisfied with the severance package that is currently on the table.  I don't want to sound greedy, but the total payout is less than one month's salary, which is lower than what I was hoping for.  And with the pandemic going on, I feel that it's not unreasonable to expect a larger payout during this time if they are looking for a clean closure.  I understand they are under no legal obligation to provide severance pay.

I would describe this company as one of the big players in the consumer electronics category, and I have been here for a few years now.

Are there any general rules of thumbs on what can usually be negotiated and what I shouldn't touch, and how to approach this conversation with HR?

Would I be laughed at if I suggested to quadruple the payout to make it 1month of pay per every year worked, and extended health benefits until the end of the year?  I have never been in this situation and definitely am out of touch with where to set my expectations.
