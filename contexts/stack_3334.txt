Why does everyone think Leta is bad? In Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald Leta Lestrange says<blockquote class=\"spoiler\">   to Dumbledore something like \"everyone thinks I'm bad\". She is also convinced Dumbledore himself believed she was bad. </blockquote>Why would she say that? We do not have any evidence she acted bad at school, actually quite the opposite, despite her being in Slytherin. <blockquote class=\"spoiler\">  We also see a girl in Dumbledore's class saying something like \"I was waiting for it\" when Leta got to face boggart which implies other student really didn't like her</blockquote>We also see her as a pretty nice young lady in her adulthood.<blockquote class=\"spoiler\">   She might consider herself bad because of what happened to her brother, but no one knew she was the reason for his death.</blockquote>So what made people see her as a bad person in school or after if we never see her acting as one?
