Is it possible to move up in a company with an Associate's degree, or should I go back to school?
Hi everyone, I just got my Associate's degree in General Studies and want to major/work in Graphic Design. Lately, I've wondered if I could receive higher pay and even move up in the company at some point if I started working at a company or firm with just an Associate's degree (or in any kind of job).

I'm thinking about this because I started a long-distance apprenticeship at a marketing firm and I'm also in search of a graphic design internship. I also found a company that can get me some experience (the same one that helped me find the apprenticeship) and connects me to companies to find a job afterward and it sounds like a good idea, the possible pay sounds decent and it would really be beneficial (at the same time, I'm not sure if not having a Bachelor's degree would affect that).

I'm thinking that I can get the essential hands-on experience in the field that I want to work in and that could possibly be enough, but at the same time, I'm not sure. What do you all think? Should I transfer to a college to study the major, or see about working in my desired field right now? What do you all think?
