My degree is useless, I can't get far in my job and I'm scared to pursue my passions. What do I do next?
Tldr at bottom

I like biology and heathcare but am very shy and introverted. Wanted to work in a lab but only really determined this after graduating. My 2.2 in Human Bioscience won't really get me anywhere.

Now I work in a NHS lab as an assistant but can't go beyond band 4 (caps at about £24k/yr) without another degree. Hated my time at uni which is putting me off going back. Job is okay but even in this small group I get a lot of bad anxiety (I worked in retail before). 

I'd like a career where I

 • Don't have to do night shifts. I like to be fairly consistent

 • Avoid working in huge groups or with the general public

 • Work from home or work a 4/3 week. I'd like to have children in the future

I don't mind earning less for a job that's near perfect but I'd like to earn enough for my partner (still a student) and I to live comfortably in the south of England.

Things I'm considering

 • Cake baker/decorator. I love making and decorating cakes. I make a good sponge but my decorating still needs work. It's fun but I'm scared of messing up especially when someone paid for my services. On a related note opening a cafe has been considered too.

 • Indie game development. I started a Unity/C# course on Udemy and I really enjoy doing pixel art. I've made games with my partner before and it's fun but I know it's not very reliable

 • Something programming related. I did computing for a short while during my a levels and loved programming but didn't enjoy the theory. Don't know much about software development as a career

Tldr 20-something graduate who loves baking and pixel art wants career that doesn't increase social anxiety but pays okay. 

Sorry for so much information but I really need help!

Edit: wow I wasn't expecting so many responses. Thank you very much everyone. I guess things aren't at a  dead end just yet
