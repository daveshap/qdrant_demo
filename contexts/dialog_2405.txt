BOBBIE: Does Cole know about this?
PHOEBE: Really -- you went with him for two years.
DEBBIE: He still thinks I'm going with him. I'm going to break the news to him tomorrow.
BOBBIE: He's not gonna be happy. And your parents can't be too thrilled either.
DEBBIE: No. As far as they're concerned the only good Rick is a dead Rick. But I don't care... it's my decision.
PHOEBE: I'm totally blown away. You're getting married. It seems like only yesterday I showed you how to have oral sex.
BOBBIE: Deb, I want to throw you a shower.
