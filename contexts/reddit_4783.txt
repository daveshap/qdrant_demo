How to coexist with depressed people (by someone with chronic depression)
Maybe a throwaway? I don't know. I'm depressed (have been managing it with increasing success over the last 10 years) and this post was inspired by this recent post in the sub: [https://old.reddit.com/r/depression\_help/comments/eeu8d4/nobody\_likes\_you\_when\_youre\_depressed/](https://old.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/eeu8d4/nobody_likes_you_when_youre_depressed/). Please feel free to add your own suggestions, these are the ones that came to mind for me. 

1. Don't tell us what we're capable of doing or have the potential to do. We're already doing our best. 
2. Providing love and support for us where we're at is the secret to getting us to function better, but sometimes even support doesn't counteract a really hard day. Be okay with this. 
3. Stop giving us advice on how to become less depressed unless we ask for it specifically. See #2. 
4. Before you say that we are perpetuating our own bad situations, remember that you are missing several factors that create a person with depression: environment, income, home life, schooling, abuse factors, etc. 
5. If you are involved in a power dynamic-oriented relationship with us (parents, bosses, etc.), you are the last person that should be pushing boundaries or forcing us to "go outside". But you are the first person who should be ensuring that you aren't pushing us too hard. 
6. People who don't want to take pills are not making excuses. Concerns about SSRIs are not unfounded, and it's up to us to weigh the risks and benefits with their doctor/psychiatrist. 
7. We're not always sad. Sometimes we're angry. Sometimes we're numb. Sometimes we seem completely cheerful and normal and hide all of our symptoms as best we can. 
8. Sometimes we *do* make it much worse with our own downward spirals and negative inner-talk. Telling us this does nothing to solve that problem. Refer to #2. 
9. Therapists - get extra rest. Take care of yourself. Do not take on too many patients. Be sure that this is what you really want to do, because people are counting on you to truly care. Be careful how you talk about people's mental health situations, because your compassion fatigue can and will rear its ugly head. 
10. If you're sick of us whining about our problems, it means you need a break from whatever is stressing you out and shouldn't be trying to support anyone's depression. Take a vacation. Go on a date. Focus on yourself. 
11. If you're close to us, ask if you can do specific things to help (if you want to). Offer to make food, clean up, or run errands on a bad day. Maybe all we need is someone to sit next to or a hug. Maybe we need some time alone. Maybe we finally need a ride to a counselor's office or hospital. Ask. 
12. Don't support us in the hopes that your efforts will "fix" our depression. It's something you have to be willing to accept without expectations of anything changing. We may beat depression, but some of us take longer or will continue to struggle with it our whole lives - if this makes you uncomfortable, that sounds like a you problem.
