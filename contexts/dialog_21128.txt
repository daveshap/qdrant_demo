RHAH: You wanted to see me sir?
WOLFE: Jackson, looks like you got Elias' squad now.
RHAH: Squad? I didn't know we was still referring to this platoon in terms of squads sir.
WOLFE: These two holes are yours...
RHAH: Begging your pardon Lieutenant but my holes are far enuff apart you could run a regiment through there and nobody'd see them - I got five live bodies left...
WOLFE: I don't want to hear your problems, Jackson. You'll get new men any day. Time being you make do like everybody else.
RHAH: Hey Lieutenant I didn't ask for this job, I...
WOLFE: I don't want to hear about it Jackson.
RHAH: You don't want to hear about it?
WOLFE: That's right. I don't want to hear about it 'cause to tell you the truth, I don't give a shit okay... I just don't give a shit anymore.
RHAH: Right...
WOLFE: This is one time we could sure use Elias.
