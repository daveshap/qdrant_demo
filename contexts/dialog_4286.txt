CARDENAS: Objection!
DULANEY: I'll rephrase the question. Mr. Roston isn't it true you are bisexual?
CARDENAS: Objection! Mr. Roston's sexual preferences are not at issue in this trial.
DULANEY: Your Honor, I'm trying to establish the sense of betrayal Miss Lawson felt when she discovered the man she lived with was a different person than she thought he was.
JUDGE BURNHAM: The witness will answer the question.
DULANEY: Mr. Roston?
ROSTON: Yes.
DULANEY: And your sexual tastes were something that you hid from Miss Lawson?
ROSTON: Yes.
DULANEY: And didn't Miss Lawson come home one day and find you in bed with your male lover?
ROSTON: Yes.
DULANEY: And she left shortly after that?
