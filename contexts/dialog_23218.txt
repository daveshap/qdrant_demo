SOMERSET: This is the one thing.
MILLS: I know.
SOMERSET: What if it's not that she's seen something? What if she's supposed to see something, but she just hasn't been given a chance to see it yet?
MILLS: Okay. But, what?
MILLS: I'm sorry about this, Mrs. Gould. I really am.
MRS GOULD: I... I don't understand.
MILLS: I need you to look at each one carefully... very carefully. Look for anything that seems strange or out of place. Anything at all.
MRS GOULD: I don't know why... why now?
MILLS: Please, I need you to help me if we're going to get who did this.
MILLS: Anything... anything missing or different.
MRS GOULD: I don't see anything.
MILLS: Are you absolutely certain?
MRS GOULD: I can't do this now... please.
