DATA: Is she still angry?
LA FORGE: No, but I'd stay out of Sickbay for a while if I were you. I still don't know why you dropped her in the water.
DATA: I was attempting to get in the spirit of things. I thought it would be humorous.
LA FORGE: Data, you're not thinking about using that thing are you?
DATA: It has occurred to me on several occasions. But I believe this may be the appropriate time.
LA FORGE: Wait a minute. I thought you've always been afraid it would overload your neural net.
DATA: That is true. However, I believe my growth as an artificial lifeform has reached an impasse. For thirty-four years I have endeavored to become more human"- to grow beyond my original programming. And yet I am still unable to grasp such a simple concept as humor. This emotion chip is the only answer."
