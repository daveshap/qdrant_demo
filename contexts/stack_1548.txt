Induction heater Please help me out. I am totally confused. I am searching over the internet many times but failed.My question is:Doe inductor coil (chock) decide resonance frequency of induction heating coil, when connects to the center tap of heating coil? If yes then how to decide the value for choke and heating coil. Which of them should be greater than the other. I tell you that what I understand... If I am incorrect then please correct me. I understand from internet and youtube that resonant frequency in induction heater is the frequency at which heating coil switches the current.it may be from several Hz to kHz and MHz. And if we can calculate resonance frequency from heating coil and capacitor, then what the choke coil is doing there connected at center tap of heating coil.
