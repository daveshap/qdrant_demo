JAKE: We had to finalize the deal.
ASHBY: Everything looks in order.
JAKE: This has to happen fast.
ASHBY: I know. It won't go unnoticed.
JAKE: There'll be red flags.
ASHBY: What's this?
JAKE: You need some convincing. Consider it a convincer.
ASHBY: Let's just slow down for a second...
JAKE: You're worried about recouping the loan. I already told you.
ASHBY: No, I understand that. What I mean... What I'm trying to say... I was actually wondering about... Well, my cut.
JAKE: Then there it is. Ashby gets the itch.
JAKE: The standard ten.
ASHBY: Ten percent. Of how much?
JAKE: Two million.
GORDO: We're going to make it back, Grant. Three or four times over.
JAKE: And all you need to do for your ten percent is put some paperwork through and push a button tomorrow.
GORDO: You'll be there?
JAKE: Eight A.M. flight.
GORDO: Calls?
JAKE: We'll use the Euc.
