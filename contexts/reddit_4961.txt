to anyone who needs to hear this : 

it’s okay not to be okay. it’s okay to be afraid of change, to fear the unknown, and to be frustrated at yourself for not knowing what your purpose is in this world or not knowing yourself yet. you’ll get there, it’s okay. you’re not alone, you never were, and you don’t have to be❤️ Just recently, I heard Jim Carey say in one of his interviews that gave me a sense of understanding why it is I keep relapsing into depression. He said depression is your body saying, “I don’t want to be this character anymore. I don’t want to hold up this avatar that you’ve created in the world. It’s too much for me. Deep rest. Your body needs to be depressed, it needs deep rest from the character that you’ve been trying to play.” 

And so, I just wanted to tell you that I love you. I may not know you and we may not have a deep rooted connection/history, but I love you. Your life makes a difference to the people around you. You MATTER. You’re a GOOD person. You are NOT a BURDEN. Take as long as you need. You’ll get through this, I’ll be here for you.❤️

Stay safe everyone!💗🙏
