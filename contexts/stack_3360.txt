Sci-fi movie \u2014 abandoned spaceship returns to Earth As a child, I saw a movie whose premise is that an abandoned Earth-made spaceship returns to Earth, leaving scientists perplexed. Meanwhile, an astronaut wanders the streets, slowly turning into an alien creature.The film concludes with a giant creature being destroyed by military firepower.It was filmed in black and white. I'm guessing it was shot in the fifties. I haven't seen it for 40 years; it was on somewhere in the late 1970s or 1980s.
