CONNOR: Hello.
MOM: Connor, is that you?
CONNOR: Mother, is that you?
MOM: Is that worthless brother of your there? I want you both ta hear this.
CONNOR: Ma, what's wrong?
MURPHY: No fuckin' hot water man. That...
CONNOR: Shut it. It's Ma.
MOM: It's all your fault. Both you little bastards. I was a fool to believe you would bring me any peace. The day your Da left us when you were almost too young to remember, he said the two of you would do me right and make me proud, but he was wrong and I got nothin' ta live for.
CONNOR: Mother, what are you sayin'? You're talkin' crazy here.
