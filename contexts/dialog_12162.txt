HAROLD: See how you've upset him. He was so merry and hale before you came home.
PENELOPE: How unhappy he's going to be--alone in his room.
HAROLD: He'll play with his rifle, I expect. That will cheer him up.
PENELOPE: Rifle?
HAROLD: I bought him a twenty-two yesterday--on the way home from Hamburger Heaven. And where is the good doctor? Have you two feathered a love nest somewhere?
PENELOPE: He's in East St. Louis with his mother--visiting an aunt.
HAROLD: Last I heard, his mother was going alone.
PENELOPE: He's afraid of you, Harold. He knew you'd want to fight him. He doesn't know anything about fighting. He hates pain.
HAROLD: And you, a supposedly healthy woman, do not detest him for his cowardice?
PENELOPE: It seems highly intelligent to me.
HAROLD: What kind of a country has this become? The men wear beads and refuse to fight--and the woman adore them. America's days of greatness are over. It has drunk the blue soup.
PENELOPE: Blue soup?
HAROLD: An Indian narcotic we were forced to drink. It put us in a haze--a honey-colored haze which was lavender around the edge. We laughed, we sang, we snoozed. When a bird called, we answered back. Every living thing was our brother or our sister, we thought. Looseleaf stepped on a cockroach six inches long, and we cried. We had a funeral that went on for five days--for the cockroach! I sang Oh Promise Me." Can you imagine? Where the hell did I ever learn the words to "Oh Promise Me"? Looseleaf delivered a lecture on maintenance procedures for the hydraulic system of a B-36. All the time we were drinking more blue soup
PENELOPE: Sounds quite beautiful.
HAROLD: Beautiful, you say? It wasn't life, it wasn't death--it wasn't anything! Beautiful? Seven years gone-- like that, like that! Seven years of silliness and random dreams! Seven years of nothingness, when there could have been so much!
PENELOPE: Like what?
HAROLD: Action! Interaction! Give and take! Challenge and response!
PAUL: Mom?
HAROLD: What's this?
HAROLD: What's this?
PAUL: Nothing.
HAROLD: That's a rifle you have?
PAUL: No.
HAROLD: Of course it is. Is it loaded?
PAUL: No.
HAROLD: Open the bolt!
HAROLD: That's a cartridge, if I'm not mistaken. Gunpowder, bullet, cartridge case, and fulminate of mercury percussion cap--all set to go. PAUL I was cleaning it.
HAROLD: Pick up that cartridge and slip it back into the chamber--where it belongs.
PAUL: Gee whiz, Dad--
HAROLD: Welcome to manhood, you little sparrowfart! Load that gun!
PAUL: Dad--
HAROLD: Too late! It's man to man now. Protecting your mother from me, are you? Protect her!`
PENELOPE: He's a child!
HAROLD: With an iron penis three feet long. Load it, boy.
PENELOPE: You're begging him to kill you?
HAROLD: If he thinks he's man enough.
PENELOPE: That's really what you want. You become furious when people won't make you dead.
HAROLD: I'm teaching my son to be a man.
PENELOPE: So he can kill you. You hate your own life that much. You beg for a hero to kill you.
HAROLD: I plan to live one hundred years!
PENELOPE: No you don't.
HAROLD: If that's the case--what's to prevent my killing myself?
PENELOPE: Honor, I suppose.
HAROLD: What a handsome word.
PENELOPE: But it's all balled up in your head with death. The highest honor is death. When you talk of these animals, one by one, you don't just talk of killing them. You honored them with death. Harold--it is not honor to be killed.
HAROLD: If you've lived a good life, fought well--
PENELOPE: It's still just death, the absence of life--no honor at all. It's worse than the blue soup by far-- that nothingness. To you, though, it's the honor that crowns them all.
HAROLD: May I continue with the rearing of my son? Load that gun!
