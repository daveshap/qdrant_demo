WADE: Just got out. Had me thirteen lawyers. Missed the electric chair twice. .. Been out three months. Are you heavy?
LINNEA: I'm not sure...
WADE: I'm forty-six. Do you like to go up or down?
LINNEA: What?
WADE: High? Do you ever get high? A walk on the wild side. Ever do dust?
WADE: All I need is fifteen minutes a night.
LINNEA: Fifteen minutes?
WADE: Sleep. That's all I need. Don't want to waste no time sleeping. You married?
