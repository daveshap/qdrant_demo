question about using tokuDB or InnoDB for financial data we want to use Percona xtraDBcluster for clustering 4 nodes (Master-Master) and we have a finance project which should have a rather large database. The number of tables is not more than 40, but we have about 2 tables which store financial transaction data and the estimated amount of data in these tables is going to grow at 350,000 records per day, and we should keep them at least 10 years to be able to do various reports.Most of the operation (98%) in these tables is Insert/read but we can separate updatable fields in a separate table.My questions are the following:Should I use a tokuDB storage engine for such large amounts of data or InnoDB?What is the best solution for such large and sensitive database?Best RegardsAli
