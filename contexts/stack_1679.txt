Heating resistor power limit This might be a stupid question but, what limits the heat power output of a heating resistor? Is it the temperature that the material can handle, or does the electrical power itself cause a heater to fail?I'm using polyimide heaters for a project, and I've seen different product descriptions specify power and voltages, but then datasheets only mention typical values and no specific. I can't seem to find answers to my question.Since they're just resistors my feeling is, I can increase the voltage/power and as long as it stays in it's operating temperature it will be fine (at least until the voltage is so high it starts to spark?). Is that correct?
