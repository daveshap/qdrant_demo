HOMER: They wanted a girl.
CURLY: Nobody ever wants me!
HOMER: You're one of the best, Curly--we couldn't let just anyone take you.
CURLY: Dr. Larch wouldn't let just anyone take *any* of us!
HOMER: That's true.
CURLY: Nobody's asked for me, have they?
HOMER: Nobody special enough, Curly.
CURLY: You mean somebody asked?
HOMER: Only the right people can have you, Curly.
