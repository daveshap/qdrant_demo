Max number of souls Dark Souls 2 SotFS PS4 In Dark Souls 2 the enemies disappear after you beat them several times, I think it's 10 times and then the enemy disappears. So, my question is, how many souls could be gained in the first playthrough of the game if you kill every enemy till it disappears, and you never lose your souls. Has anyone done this?
