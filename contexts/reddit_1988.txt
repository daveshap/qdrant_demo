i thought this was pretty funny
my 10 yo friend saw me writing essay drafts, he read them and was like “woah, your English is so so good!! my English is like 5x worse than that!” i was like haha thanks, but if my English weren’t better than yours then that would be a problem lol

then he asked me what schools i was applying to. i said “some schools in the ivy league.”

“what schools? Harvard? ooh you should apply to Princeton!”

“oh sure lol”

“your essay is so good, you’ll definitely get into Harvard!”

he was so excited and his expression was so pure i didn’t have the heart to tell him that a) i’m not applying there and b) even if i did, there’s a much lower chance than he thinks that i would be accepted 😭
