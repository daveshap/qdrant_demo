Has anyone been able to preserve or repair their job and work relationships with their boss after mediation?
So Iâ€™m now in mediation which means I can no longer discuss the specifics of the case, but I am wondering if anyone here has gone through mediation and if so, what was the outcome? Were you able to preserve your job? What was your relationship like with your boss/coworker after the mediation? Did you ultimately end up leaving the company anyway due to the awkwardness and strained relationship following the dispute? What was the actual mediation process like and were you truly satisfied with the outcome?
