Is the grass always greener?
I feel like am constantly toying with the “grass is always greener” mentality. I have recently switched jobs thinking it would be better than my last and while some aspects are I miss my old job in a way. However, when I think about my old job and tasks I had to complete I talk myself out of missing it. I am just worried I’ll never find what I am “meant to do” in life/my passion. Thinking more and more that my job will not be my passion but what I do to aide in finding my passion? It’s just tough when you spend majority of your day and life in a job and when you don’t really like it it’s daunting -  it’s an overwhelming feeling. Does anyone deal with this? If so what do you do outside of work to make yourself forget about it until the next day? I’m tired of having the stress of the job consume my life. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!!!
