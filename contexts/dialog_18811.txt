THOMAS J: At what?
VADA: That's Mr. Bixler, let's go talk to him.
THOMAS J: I don't wanna talk to a teacher, it's summer!
VADA: Hi Mr. Bixler!
MR. BIXLER: Mademoiselle Sultenfuss and the amazing Dr. J! How's the summer treating you?
VADA: It's okay. Mr. Bixler, I finished all the books for summer reading.
MR. BIXLER: Really? Already? The summer's just begun.
VADA: Yes, and now I'm reading War &amp; Peace for fun.
MR. BIXLER: No wonder you're my prize pupil. What about you Thomas J?
