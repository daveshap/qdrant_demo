LOMBARD: Get a pen and don’t ask any questions.
EMILY: Oh. What... Yeah. Okay.
LOMBARD: Route 395. Past Edwards Air Force base and about half a mile before a place called the Red Mountain Motel. There’s a dirt track with a ‘Closed to the public’ sign. It leads to some kind of ranch in the middle of nowhere. If you haven’t heard from me by morning send the cavalry, okay? But not before, you hear?
EMILY: Have you found your man? Is that where he is?
LOMBARD: I think so. And if it comes to it, tell the cops anything you think will make them move. Whatever you came up with couldn’t come close to how bad it is. Bye now.
