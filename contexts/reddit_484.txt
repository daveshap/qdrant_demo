As a 21 year old (F) would it be better to see a male or female therapist?
For the first time since i was 14, i’m going back to see a therapist. I had 2 sessions when i was 14 but quit, due to her(therapist) trying to make me seem insane or blame my family. Maybe it’s because i’m born into a muslim family that most females(bosses, teachers etc) try to look for an excuse to blame my family for everything, in short i learned to bullshit with every female authority that’s not family - so i thought why not try a male this time?

Any experiences with male therapists? Is it a good idea if you want to talk about anxiety, past sexual abuse etc? Or should i try again with a female?
