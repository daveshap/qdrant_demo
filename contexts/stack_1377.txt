Amplifying pulse signal (0.1 .. 0.5V) to Arduino digital input How this can be so difficult (to me :-). The incoming sensor signal rests close to 0 Volts and gives ~ 0.5V pulses, which needs to be read by Arduino digital input (interrupts).So far, what I have tried:  0.5Volts is just under optocoupler to function, that would have been easy.Reading directly this small signal to Analog input. OK, but timing is not enough accurate. So, definitely want to use Arduino digital interrupt.When sensor sends 0.5V pulse -> 5V to arduino digital input HIGH state. If sensor signal goes under 0.2V -> Arduino digital input to LOW state.OK, OP amps perhaps, but how? Have tried to simulate, without getting right things around suitable op amp.I have single DC supply +5Volt to drive things.I would like to keep component amount small, tiny package.
