SHAUNESSY: Objection! Your honor, counsel is raising a question that is not germane to these proceedings.
GRESSEN: While the child was in the care of the witness, he cut his face badly and is now scarred.
JUDGE: Are you introducing the question of negligence here, counselor?
GRESSEN: Yes, your honor.
JUDGE: I see. Well, you'll have to do better than that. Do you have any affidavits to support negligence?
GRESSEN: I do not, your honor, however--
JUDGE: This is an isolated incident, counselor, unless you can prove otherwise.
GRESSEN: Does the witness deny the injury took place?
JUDGE: No, counselor, I'm going to over- rule you on this line of questioning.
GRESSEN: Then I have concluded my questions.
