ALBERT: Cooper, the ooze of mumbo jumbo is rising up above our heads. Do you honestly think Cole's practice of word association works?
COOPER: The very fact that we are talking about word association means we are in a space that was opened up by our practice of word association. The world is a hologram, Albert.
ALBERT: Yes, it's a great big psychedelic circus ride, isn't it, Cooper?
COOPER: Albert.
ALBERT: You said, Teresa Banks"
COOPER: Yes. Either right now or right when I thought of it. The name and memory of Teresa Banks is haunting me. Lately I have been filled with a knowingness that the murderer will strike again. Because it is only a feeling, I am powerless to stop it. And another thing, Albert, when the next murder happens you will help me solve it.
ALBERT: Let's test it for the record. Will the next victim be a man or a woman?
COOPER: A woman.
ALBERT: What color hair will she have?
COOPER: Blonde.
ALBERT: Tell me some other things about her.
COOPER: She's in high school. She's sexually active. She's on drugs. She's crying out for some help.
ALBERT: You're describing half the high school girls in America. What is she doing right now?
COOPER: She is preparing a great abundance of food.
NORMA: Shelly, would you give Laura a quick hand with the Meals on Wheels"?"
SHELLY: I'm kind of busy, Norma.
NORMA: You're not busy, sweetheart, now go.
