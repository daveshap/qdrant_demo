Did fake news affect the outcome of the US election?
Even prior to the recent US presidential election, there was a lot of [talk about the influence of *fake news.*](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/07/business/media/medias-next-challenge-overcoming-the-threat-of-fake-news.html?_r=0) And afterwards, news organizations [tracked down the sources](http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2016/12/02/504155809/episode-739-finding-the-fake-news-king) of fake news and discussed the [failed efforts to curtail it.](https://gizmodo.com/facebooks-fight-against-fake-news-was-undercut-by-fear-1788808204)

Surveys of voters show that [a large percentage of people believe news stories that are demonstrably false, even when those people are confident in their own ability to distinguish the real news from the fake.](http://www.forbes.com/sites/brettedkins/2016/12/20/americans-believe-they-can-detect-fake-news-studies-show-they-cant/#34ccfacd54a4)

On the other hand, Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook — one of the main promotional channels for fake news — [called the idea of it influencing the election "pretty crazy."](http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2016/11/10/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-fake-news-didnt-sway-election/93622620/) More importantly, the fact that [the "rust belt" states swung the election toward the Republican](http://www.cleveland.com/politics/index.ssf/2016/11/donald_trump_flipped_rust_belt.html) this year implies that people [voted according to their economic interests,](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/21/disaffected-rust-belt-voters-embraced-donald-trump-midwestern-obama) not because they believed untrue allegations about Hillary Clinton. To my thinking, this calls into question the whole idea of fake news really affecting the outcome.

So, **is there evidence that ties voting patterns in key states or demographics to a belief in fake news stories?** Is there a correlation between voter belief in fake news and turnout, such that those who believed fake news favorable to Trump were more likely to show up to the polls? 

Clearly, it would be good if the electorate made all its choices based purely on the facts, so I'm not suggesting that fake news isn't a problem. But I'd like to understand how big an influence it actually had on the electoral outcome.

**EDIT:** A lot of the responses are focusing on whether specific stories were or weren't examples of fake news. That's not the purpose of this post, though it does reveal part of the problem: we can't agree on what is fake or how to make that determination. Still, it's a topic for another post. For this discussion, I've bolded my main question above.
