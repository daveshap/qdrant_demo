should i join a play... with my ex
so i have always really liked singing and now that im a senior in hs i thought joining my school play would be a good chance to finally embrace my passion. i think i have a pretty good chance of getting a role. the problem however is my ex is also in the play. the part that i am auditioning for requires for me to kiss the character that he is auditioning for. i do have some mixed feeling for him still but i really donâ€™t want to miss this opportunity to sing. so should i join the play ?
