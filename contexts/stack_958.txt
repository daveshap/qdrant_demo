\"No root file system is defined. Please correct this from the partitioning menu\" during installation I'm fairly new to learning about computers. I have a self-built computer and while installing Ubuntu (my first operating system) I run into a dialog. I press install now and it replies <blockquote>  no root file system is defined. Please correct this from the partitioning menu</blockquote>The partition table button is grayed out and the only thing I can do is press the change button. The change button crashes it so I can't continue and I have no options to press.
