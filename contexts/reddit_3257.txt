Would you take a 45% pay raise if it meant working out of state 50+ minutes away?
I’ve been at my current job for 4 years. There’s no raises or promotions in sight. 

Two days ago a recruiter contacted me through LinkedIn out of the blue and set up an interview at this other company. He sent them my resume and they are having me interview today. If I am offered the job it would be between 34-45% increase in my salary, but my drive to work would change from 12-15 minutes to 45-60 minutes and would take me to the adjacent state. 

What should I do? How would you go about making a decision like this? 

Edit: just came back from the interview. It’s a very small company ~10 employees right now. My current company is much larger with several plants and offices around the country/world. Not sure how I feel about leaving for such a small company.
