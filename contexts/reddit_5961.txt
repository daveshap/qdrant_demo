I have a mediocre marketing resume and a useless liberal arts degree. How much will adding some certificates in things like SEO, Google Analytics, python, etc. help me?
I currently teach English in Vietnam. Before leaving the US last year, I had spent a total of 2.5 out of the 4 years since graduation unemployed. I have a few spotty years of marketing experience and a useless German degree. Zero connections in that industry.

Competing against everyone else on the internet who could apply to the same internet job listings was hopeless. I applied to 500+ jobs before I left. Thanks to taking a year to find a job after college, and then being laid off after the company went under, my resume looks bad compared to someone with a solid 2 or 3 years at one company and a business degree. I have misc. marketing experience to fill the gaps to an extent, but nothing serious. Mostly volunteering. 

There is no way I can return to the US without being in the same exact situation unless I make a major change to my resume. What skills can I add to my resume to give myself a boost? I think that some SEO or Google Analytics or programming certificates could really help my case, especially if I highlight them properly in my resume.
