ROB: How can you like Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye? It's like saying you support the Israelis and the Palestinians.
LAURA: It's not like saying that at all, actually, Rob. Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye make pop records --
ROB: -- Made. Made. Marvin Gaye is dead, his father shot him in --
LAURA: -- whatever, and the Israelis and the Palestinians don't. Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye are not engaged in a bitter territorial dispute, and the Israelis and the Palestinians are. Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye --
ROB: -- Alright, alright but --
LAURA: -- and who says I like Marvin Gaye, anyway?
ROB: Hey! Marvin Gaye! Got to Give It Up!" That's our song! Marvin Gaye is responsible for our entire relationship!"
LAURA: Is that right? I'd like a word with him.
ROB: But don't you remember?
LAURA: I remember the song. I just couldn't remember who sang it.
