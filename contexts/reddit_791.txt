Advice about parents
So idk if this is the right place for this, posting from a throwaway account. So my story is I’m a perfect daughter, perfect grades, respectful, all that stuff. But my parents (well really my mom) think everyone on the internet are insane stalkers and I should never talk to anyone on the internet. Well of course they have no clue I have reddit. It’s my small and only rebellion against the rigid rules. If they found out they’d be furious. But anyways here’s where I need the advice. I have a great friend I made here on reddit, we talk everyday and no, he isnt a creepy 40 year old dude in his mom’s basement. We use discord to chat. All we’ve been doing is using the text feature but we both really want to voice chat, but my parents would freak because theyd know he’s not someone from school. He doesn’t know my parents are strict and don’t know about my account, and has been asking to voice chat while I come up with bs excuses because really the only time I’d be able to chat would be if I’m home alone, which isn’t too often. So advice I guess?
