MIGUEL: Prayers have no power to save. The knife can save. It can cut the disease away. The bullet. It can shatter the brain where the evil takes seed. These are saviours...our new saviours...our only saviours.
MARIA: We must wait. One day the curse will pass. One day a dead man will... will...
MIGUEL: One day a dead man will refuse to return, and that man will be a saint. The first saint of our century. That's a prayer, too. A catechism. Something the priests tell us to believe.
MARIA: You can believe this, Miguel. I'll kill you if you shoot. We must wait. I'll....I'll do it....I'll do it myself....when it needs to be done.
MIGUEL: No. You won't be able to do it. He will rise. He will rise and you... you will die.
