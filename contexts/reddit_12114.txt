traumatized by a remark
When I was in the 8th grade, I had this one friend who was pretty narcissistic, I didn't know it at the time, but also because he concealed that side of him pretty well, until that day where he talked shit about me behind my back. We were assigned to a group project, when it was break time from the project, he went to talk with his other friend, I overheard him said something along the lines of "he's useless as shit". When it came to recess time, I confront him about it in front of others, he kept denying it, until the very end, and played victim, and I outburst in anger, so basically he gas-lighted the situation and kept saying how he already is suffering enough from his parents, now I'm making him suffer, it's crazy how narcissistic he was at this age. I'm really certain this left a scar on me, now I feel the need to overcompensate when I work with others, feel the need to not feel useless, and would really get hurt if I am ever called that again, sometimes it's so bad that I avoid any group work activities.
