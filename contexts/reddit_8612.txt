I'm Steve Vladeck, law professor at the University of Texas School of Law. Ask me anything!
Hi all -- I'm delighted to be here for today's AMA. My full bio is here (https://law.utexas.edu/faculty/stephen-i-vladeck). To make a long story short, I'm in my 13th year as a law professor (my second at the University of Texas School of Law), and my teaching, research, and writing generally focuses on the federal courts, national security law, and, oftentimes, the intersection of those two fields.

Aside from teaching and writing, I spend a decent amount of time doing litigation work (I argued a case about military officers holding civilian offices in the Supreme Court in January), am co-editor-in-chief of Just Security (https://www.justsecurity.org/), co-host the National Security Law Podcast (https://www.nationalsecuritylawpodcast.com/), and help CNN with its Supreme Court coverage.

I'm a native New Yorker, which also explains my sports allegiances (Mets / Giants / Rangers / Knicks). My wife, Karen, is also a laywer (http://www.wittliffcutter.com/karen-vladeck). We have a two-year-old daughter and a four-year-old pug. And I tweet too much (https://twitter.com/steve_vladeck).

So that's the short version of me. What would you like to ask about?
