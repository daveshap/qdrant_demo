DAVID: Sex lines? Is that it? Triple X-rated interactive fantasy? Old habits die hard.
ALEX: Yeah, I was phoning your mother.
DAVID: You old devil. Well, anyway, as you can see, we're leaving.
ALEX: So I gathered.
DAVID: Yeah, I'm sorry, but that's the way it is.
ALEX: It's all right. I'll forward your mail.
DAVID: No, really, I am sorry, sorry to be ducking out on you like this. I hope you won't take it personally.
ALEX: Oh, no, no, no. Don't let it worry you. Not at all. It's probably for the best.
DAVID: For the best. Exactly. I wouldn't want things to end on a downer.
ALEX: Not at all.
DAVID: I mean, we've had ups and downs, right -- good times, bad times?
ALEX: Yeah?
DAVID: But more laughter than tears, I think? Yes. On balance? I mean, remember that time when -- oh, we could talk all night, but we have to go. Don't we, Juliet?
JULIET: Yes.
DAVID: And you need your sleep.
