PHELPS: ..when you think about it, Ethan, it was inevitable..no more Cold War. No more secrets you keep from everyone but yourself, operations you answer to no one but yourself. Then one morning you wake up and find out the President of the United States is running the country - <i>without your permission</i>. The son-of-a- bitch! How <i>dare</i> he? You realize itís over, youíre an obsolete piece of hardware not worth upgrading, youíve got a lousy marriage and sixty-two grand a year. Kittridge, weíll go after that no good son-of-a-bitch, big time!
ETHAN: We donít have to, Jim. Heíll come after us.
PHELPS: Whatís going to make him do that?
ETHAN: What he didnít get in Prague. The NOC list.
PHELPS: Jesus, Ethan. Good for you.
ETHAN: A meeting tomorrow on the TGV, enroute to Paris.
PHELPS: Tight security. No guns. Real plus.
ETHAN: If I supposedly deliver the NOC list to Max, Max has agreed to deliver Job to me. Iíll have Claire and Luther Stickell with me on the train. Marcel Krieger will have helicopter transport waiting in Paris.
ETHAN: Jim...?
PHELPS: I was sitting in a cafe waiting for you and suddenly there she was, standing in the rain just outside the safe house..alive and beautiful..and thinking Iím dead and gone. God knows what sheís had to do forget about me to keep going and get the job done, I..
PHELPS: - no. She canít know about me. No one can. Not til this is over. Thereís too much at stake, Ethan.
ETHAN: Youíre probably right.
PHELPS: I usually am.
ETHAN: Once we leave the safehouse, get in there and crash. Iíll call you from Paris.
PHELPS: You got it.
ETHAN: And get a doctor.
PHELPS: Good luck.
CLAIRE: What happened?
ETHAN: I sent the message to Max. Weíre on for tomorrow.
CLAIRE: Okay...
ETHAN: Is this the only way?
CLAIRE: Yes.......come here....viens pres moi...
