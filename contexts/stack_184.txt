MacBook Air won't power on My MacBook Air won't turn on. I plugged in the charger and it says it's charging. When I turn it on, the light instantly turns green for a few seconds, and then it goes to amber.What's going on?I also had an error before, when it was alive: the dreaded frozen bluetooth keyboard assistant error. I didn't make that one go away but I'm not sure if it relates to this issue.
