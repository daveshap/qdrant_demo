Other HR representatives/receptionists, have you ever been insulted over the phone while trying to setup interviews? How do you respond?
(Also sorry I’m on mobile for formatting) First time this is happening to me today. An applicant had two phone numbers listed on their resume. I called the first one, person asked who it was, when I responded they immediately said “ugh” and hung up. I figured maybe the person had the incorrect number so I called the second one. Second person asked who it was, responded with the same information and before I could say we received their resume they said “suck a dick” and hung up. I went back onto the website and it was the correct number. I’m assuming both the numbers listed was the applicants and their spouse. So I’m not sure why they insulted me when they were the ones who were trying to apply to the job we listed? It’s not as if we called them a week later or so after they applied. I rejected the applicant afterwards, sent them a rejection email, and reported them on the website itself. Not sure if I should be changing the way I answer? I usually start off with “Hi is this (name)?” Then I say who I am, the company I’m with, and that we received their resume for our position. Should I start with something else?
