CUMMINGS: This one's going to be even more fun.
FLETCH: Go ahead. Make my evening.
FLETCH: I'm calling the police. Then I'm leaving. You wait here for them.
GAIL: Where are you going?
FLETCH: Away. I think it might take you a while to get your life back together. You don't need me around. Don't go back in there.
GAIL: I really creamed the sonofabitch, didn't I?
FLETCH: You sure did.
WAITER: Your call is come through.
FLETCH: Far out. Larry? It's Fletch. Well, it's not 'Fat Sam's', but... any port in a storm. Oh, tell Frank I need a couple of months. The fifty grand's lasting longer than I thought.
