RICK: Don't you think it kind of defeats the purpose?
ALICE: What?
RICK: The mirror. You can't see yourself in it.
ALICE: I don't want to.
RICK: Yeah. She'd be half as strict as you.
ALICE: But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that.
RICK: Look, you gotta stand up for yourself. Learn to fight back.
ALICE: Rick...I can't.
RICK: Never say can't. Just do what I do.
