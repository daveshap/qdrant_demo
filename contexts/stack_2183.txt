How do I beat Bane, the final boss? When I reached Bane, I did all the sidequests, reached level 50, had decent equipment, had two conquered towns, all allies and a decent mount......and I failed miserably 3 times trying to kill him.So, logically, in order to prevent Bane from conquering the world and crushing it under heel of tyranny, I trained my Griffon mount to level 32+ (and later raised it to 41), conquered the whole world and crushed it under heel of my tyranny by skipping all tedious unnecessary random encouters and collecting monthly tribute.I did the last part for 5 hours. I trained my Morale from less than 10 to 48, equipped the most game-breaking gear I could find, conceived the most game-breaking strategy I could think of.I have cheesed the hell out of the game, optimised everything I could think of, grinded it in a way shouldn't be possible started Bane fight and......lost yet again 3 times in a row.Bane doesn't have any weakpoints, and no strategy that could work earlier in the game works with him:you can't rush him, because he has the most HP in the game,you can't ignore skulls to build up mana reserve, because he hits like a truck from the get-go so you have to deny all skulls matches,you can't beat him down with spell wombo-combo, because he has 16% of every colour resistance and that keeps raising further during the fight,you can't ignore spells and wear him down with just skulls matches, because you deal at most ~10 damage from skulls and he can randomly heal that every turn and also heals from Morale buffs,he can rearrange the board and buff himself as a free action for no cost at all - so strategy of starving him of mana don't work either,since he has all his skills buffed into the stratosphere, he gets A LOT of extra moves.He's just a big brick wall of pain.How do I beat him? Is it actually possible or did just everyone singing praises about Puzzle Quest abandon the game before finishing it?
