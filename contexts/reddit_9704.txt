How does one improve or practice conduct skills?
I'm in my first professional role as a Hall Director.  I love the job, but it's painfully obvious that I cannot perform the conduct piece.  Every case I have, I miss a major piece, whether it's at the scene, doing the hearing, making the decision, etc.  I just can't seem to get things right in the moment.  When outside of a conduct space, I mentally have a full grasp on it.  It's when I'm actually practicing conduct when the wheels come off the wagon.  I even just had a conversation with my supervisor, and we both agree housing is probably not a future position for me.  We've tried giving myself specific guidelines and steps to follow, special training sessions, etc, but nothing seems to be working.  I do improve in some areas, but when I do, I fall behind in others; it's like a constant state of two steps forward-two steps back.  I'm relatively content and excited to not have a housing role in the future, but I also want to show myself that I can improve; I want to have a wide range of skills I can utilize in future roles.  

Does anyone have any resources, advice, or strategies they use to help practice or improve their conduct skills?  Are there any ways to "practice" conduct outside of a conduct setting, because I can't exactly create conduct scenarios with which to practice.
