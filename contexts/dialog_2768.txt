MAYHEW: So now I'm s'posed to roll over like an ol' bitch dog gettin' ger belly scratched.
AUDREY: Bill –
BARTON: Look, maybe it's none of my business, but a man with your talent – don't you think your first obligation would be to your gift? Shouldn't you be doing whatever you have to do to work again?
MAYHEW: And what would that be, son?
BARTON: I don't know exactly. But I do know what you're doing with that drink. You're cutting yourself off from your gift, and from me and Audrey, and from your fellow man, and from everything your art is about.
MAYHEW: No son, thisahere moonshine's got nothin' to do with shuttin' folks out. No, I'm usin' it to build somethin'.
BARTON: What's that?
MAYHEW: I'm buildin' a levee. Gulp by gulp, brick by brick. Raisin' up a levee to keep that ragin' river of manure from lappin' at m'door.
