Homie broke the bro code
One of my good homies is trying to take the girl i want before i can get to her even though he has a girl.

We met her around the same time and he introduced her to me he told me it qould be good if we started talking maybe something could start between us. About five days ago him and her were chilling with her and her friend things were going good for me until he found out she smoked weed and wasn't as innocent as she was leading people on to belive. He started to get super flirty towards her which pissed me off

He the type of guy that puts hoes before bros and loves the attention girls give him. Whenever he arounda a girl or a group of girls he always switches up making himself seem more grand than he actually is which bothers me.

When they left i tapped him and asked him what he thought he was doing and he just told me "maybe if you get better game and stop complaining so much girl will stop playing you" which obviously pissed me off even more

The next day we were chilling at my house and i noticed they were snaping all day.

He broke the bro code and i dont know if i should try and take the girl by force or if shoukd just allow it and move on.

Any advice would be appreciated thank you
