MAGUIRE: And what's she like between the sheets?
FERGUS: Definitely unusual.
MAGUIRE: And who is she?
FERGUS: Just a girl.
MAGUIRE: And you know what'll happen if you fuck up again, don't you?
FERGUS: Aye, I do, Peter.
MAGUIRE: Good.
MAGUIRE: So what do you think that is, Hennessy?
FERGUS: A hotel?
MAGUIRE: It's a knocking-shop. Tres discreet, huh? He visits his ladies on Tuesday and Thursday nights and Saturday mornings. His security's in the car beyond.
FERGUS: Who is he?
MAGUIRE: Doesn't matter who he is. He is what we would call a legitimate target.
FERGUS: Thank God for that.
MAGUIRE: You being cynical, Hennessy?
FERGUS: Hope not.
MAGUIRE: Good. So what do you think?
FERGUS: Whoever hits him'll be hit, if those men are any good. And I presume you can't get in.
MAGUIRE: Right.
FERGUS: So it's on the street.
MAGUIRE: Right.
FERGUS: Kind of suicide, isn't it?
FERGUS: But, then, I don't have a choice.
JUDE: Och, you do, Fergie.
FERGUS: Of course. I forgot.
JUDE: Come on, Fergie. A rehearsal.
