GIDEON: Babe Brother and his wife are taking advantage of a situation. I hate to be mean to people but picking Sunny up when they feel like it has to come to an end. Now I'm going to ask him how come he couldn't be at your birthday.
SUZIE: Don't bother the poor boy. It just takes some people a little longer to figure out who they are.
GIDEON: I don't know how two brothers can be so different.
