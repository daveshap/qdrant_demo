BOBO: Are you ready?
MR. JOHNNY: Hello, Bobo. How are you tonight?
BOBO: Very good, Mr. Johnny.
MR. JOHNNY: We will both have the Salad Ticino.
BOBO: Uh-huh
MR. JOHNNY: And I'll have the special fish.
LORETTA: You don't want the fish.
MR. JOHNNY: No?
LORETTA: It's the oily fish tonight. Not before the plane ride.
MR. JOHNNY: Maybe you're right.
LORETTA: Give him the manicotta, Bobo. Me, too.
