Men, you wasting a lot of time not being straightforward. speak your intentions within the first or second conversation
If you are looking to date, state that. If you want to fuck - tell her you find her very attractive, and if the chance presented, you would love to have sex.... 



When:

When you have a rapport....understand this: vulnerability begets vulnerability. 

why: 

If you are honest upfront, you will know
 whether you are wasting your time... also, if she declines, she knows where you stand - there's no confusion.....

and if you really really like her: you can still have that dynamic

thank you for coming to my Ted Talk 

Also, Don't do it in public obviously, do it when it's a private conversation. Most women have to battle the opinions of other women especially with slut shaming, me too movements being amok.  


Just don't lie about who you are and what you're looking for...

Also,

women primarily know whether or not they want to fuck with you by how you carry yourself, listen to the first minute of ODB-don't U know...... being truthful just brings it to forefront ...

edit: a lot of you men don't understand basic attraction or body language signals.... I don't go up to random women, strike random convos, and blurt it out... you get a convo, if she clearly Happy to talk to you and engages and wants to tell you things it's a good sign.... if she's giving you a look it's a good sign....
