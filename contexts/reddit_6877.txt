I lost my job yesterday
This is the first time in my life that I’ve ever experienced this. I didn’t pass my probation after ten weeks in a job.

Does anyone have any tips on how to deal with all of this? I’ve started looking for a new job but my confidence has taken a knock after being let go as they put it down to performance. Does anyone who’s been through this have any tips to get through? I’m feeling a bit lost.
