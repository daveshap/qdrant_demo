CHRIS: So how's your work?
KATKA: It's okay, they're training me on the cash register and after I hope to work on one of the jewellery counters.
CHRIS: Sounds cool.....Do you think he's serious about squatting a place?
KATKA: I don't know, I don't care. I see too much of him and he's changed. He used to be busy at the magazine. But now he's been doing nothing for months, like he doesn't care about anything, including me.
CHRIS: Well, he sure seems fired up all of a sudden.
KATKA: It won't last, believe me. And you, when will you go back to the States?
CHRIS: I don't know, maybe I'll enrol for postgrad' studies next Autumn.
