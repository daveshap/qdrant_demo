ANDREA: Just tell me that Evan doesn't have Jason's illness...
DR. REDFIELD: Look, Andrea, I'm sure he'll test negative for brain disorders. But there's something else you can try to monitor his memory.
ANDREA: Anything.
DR. REDFIELD: A journal. Just have him write down everything he does.
ANDREA: Why? What for?
DR. REDFIELD: It could be extremely useful to jog his memory. See if he remembers anything new the next day. And I'll have the test results back in a few days.
