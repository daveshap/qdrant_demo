LEON: Coffee for me, I gotta slow down.
EDDIE: Vodka tonic.
LEON: Maybe you could just put in a shot of Martell?
LEON: It was freaky, I'll tell you. Stupid kid.
EDDIE: What's the kid gonna say - sorry? Meanwhile I'm not here anymore. Like last week - we were at the morgue and this guy was all chopped up - spleen here - liver there - his heart in a pan. Six hours ago this guy was walkin' his dog or buyin' a quart of milk. Who knows? But some kid's robbed him for $3 or some shit and shot him and now you can't tell if he's a piece of beef or a human being and I'm thinkin' that's me. Sooner or later. That's me.
HAWKINS: Sooner or later that's everybody.
EDDIE: Not chopped up. Not chopped up like that. I mean, what do I got left? Coupla articles. A medal or two. Plaque here and there and in a coupla years no one remembers me anymore.
HAWKINS: I think you're getting a little moody there, Eddie.
EDDIE: I'm not moody.
HAWKINS: Isn't he a little moody?
LEON: Of course he's moody. He thinks he's in love.
HAWKINS: In love? With who?
EDDIE: How old are your kids?
HAWKINS: My kids? Let's see...Susan's 15. Aundrea's 9. Don't tell me you're thinking about having a kid! How old are you? Never mind. Let me just tell you this: Every stupid cliche you hear about kids - they change your life, they make you a better person, they make you whole... It's all true! Before I had kids when friends talked about their kids, I wanted to vomit. Now -- I get it. Am I right, Leon?
