SAM: Grandpa, stop doin' the Indian Walk!
GRANDPA: Gotta keep in practice. It's a dyin' art.
SAM: Good!
GRANDPA: Whatcha doin' over here?
SAM: Oh... I was just... having a look at your truck. What's all that wood in there for?
GRANDPA: Been fixin' to build me fence one of these days. Bought all the materials, then put it off... for about ten years. Well, one more day won't hurt. Wanna go into town with me?
SAM: Great. I wanna get some new comics.
