Do I actually hate my job, or does everybody feel this way?
Sorry for formatting, I’m on mobile!

I’m an engineer working for a consumer products company. This is my first job out of college, I’ve been here for 2 years.

On paper, I feel like I should love my job. I make great money, have a lot of autonomy to take on and lead many different types of projects, work reasonable hours, and live in a decent mid-sized city. My work is low stress and has a lot of flexibility, my current boss is a little absent but otherwise we get along fine.

This all said, the reality is that I find myself DREADING work every single day. I can’t make myself care about my projects anymore, which is shocking from somebody who has been an ambitious workaholic their entire life. I end up crying in the bathroom an embarrassing amount. I feel like I’m losing my drive by the day.

To try to articulate what I don’t like in my job:
- I love working on teams, closely with people. The culture of my group doesn’t facilitate this, we work very isolated from each other.
- I don’t care about the final products I work on. I always envisioned myself “making a difference in the world”, and it’s hard to see how that’s true in CPG.
- I don’t feel challenged like I did in undergrad, much of my work is paper pushing or hunting down other people to make sure their work is getting done.

However, these are all normal complaints! None of these should be reasons to feel as miserable as I am! Right??! Or maybe they are?

So, Reddit, I’m looking to hear how others feel about their work / felt about their first jobs. I’m starting to look for a new role within the company, but hesitant to start looking for positions externally quite yet because I’m stuck wondering: is the grass just greener on the outside? Is this simply what work feels like for everyone, and I need to suck it up and appreciate what I have?

Thanks in advance for any inputs!
