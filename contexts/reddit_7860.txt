Traveling on plane with poster tube
Hello! As anyone traveled to conferences on planes (especially American Airlines) with a poster tube before? My tube is clear but kinda large and bulky (also obnoxiously neon yellow lol) . Does it count as my “personal item” I can take on with my carry-on? I always try and avoid checking my baggage because in my experience it always gets lost or damaged, I especially don’t want to checked my poster. 

I’ve been to a lot of conferences before but this my first time traveling by plane. Should I expect any issues or problems with my tube? Will they even allow it in the cabin of the plane? Thank you for any advice!
