TELLY: I like you so much. I think you're beautiful. I think if we fucked you would love it. You wouldn't believe it.
DARCY: How do you know?
TELLY: I just know. I know you'll love it.
DARCY: But I'm scared Telly.
TELLY: I'm telling you. There's nothing in the world to worry about.
DARCY: Nothing?
TELLY: Nothing. I'm telling you I just want to make you happy. That's all. Just trust me.
DARCY: I don't want you to hurt me.
TELLY: I don't want you to hurt you. I'll be gentle.
DARCY: Do you care about me?
TELLY: Of course I do.
