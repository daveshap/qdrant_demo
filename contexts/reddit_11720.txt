Cannot tell weather I am lazy or just really depressed
So I am a newly minted grad student I moved to a new city this semester (I dont know anyone here) I live alone (NOT BY CHOICE) and I have been battling some serious depression the entire semester (mostly because I'm alone and its hard for me to handle). After the first round of midterms I got C's (around average for the classes) figured I just needed to study harder etc. After the first found of midterms (about a month into the semester (2 midterms and a final kind of schedule)) I started getting really depressed over the loneliness, and everything just lost meaning. It would ebb and flow but some days I just couldnt do anything, nothing mattered, currently, nothing matters, seccond round of midterms comes around, I burn an entire weekend studying for one of them, and get worse than the first. On top of that I get it back and fix all of my mistakes in about an hour using nothing but the formula sheet we were given for the exam, after that...well things got worse, now there are days I'm just skipping class and doing NOTHING for hours followed by internet followed by feeling like shit for doing nothing, but then reminding me that it doesnt matter because even if I do something it wont help. I cant tell if I'm just being a lazy fuck or if this is part of depression or what
