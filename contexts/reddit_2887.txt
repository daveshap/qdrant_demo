Do employers ever hire slightly “overqualified” people who are willing to do the job to restart their career?
I’ve been out of university for 3 years. Graduated with a finance degree. 

I have 1 year of finance intern experience, and 2 years of non finance full-time experience. This makes me a little overqualified for entry level finance jobs, so ive been told, but I am willing to take a pay cut and a lower job so I can restart my finance path. 

Is this ever acceptable to employers? I’d be happier with a lower pay working in the industry i WANT to be in, under a organization I enjoy. My current job is deadend and I took it as it was the first paying offer...maybe that was a mistake
