Building a Community in my classroom
I’m a 2nd year (ish) Electrical Engineering Student. I am looking for a platform to use to connect with other students in my class. I want this to be something that is simple for everyone to use where we can post questions (with pictures), videos we like, set up in person/virtual study groups. I used to create Facebook groups for each class, which worked until everyone started hating FB. Also, it has distracting notifications.


I’m at a community college where the ages range from 18-30s and the students come from all over the world, thus needing something easy and simple that people will actually sign up for. 

I really want to do this ASAP, so I can announce it in my next class. Any suggestions are appreciated!
