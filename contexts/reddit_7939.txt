Paper just rejected (again)
After 3 years of work and super exciting results for our field, my short paper was just rejected for the 6th time. Iâ€™m the only grad student between two groups. Friday is not looking good. 

How do you cope with rejection and doubts about your research? 

Edit: thanks for the advice everyone! I think my PI and I just need to get on the same page at this point.
