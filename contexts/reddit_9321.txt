Just paid off my credit card!
Got a bonus at work, which happened to give me just enough cash to pay off my credit card ($2,500). 

While it’s not the most sexy thing to use a bonus on, I look at the positives. I no longer have to make a $77 minimum payment each month. I no longer will be charged nearly $50 in interest each month. Not only that, but my largest interest “loan” is paid off, and I can finally start throwing extra money now towards my car and student loans.

One step at a time! I highly recommend everyone make a budget in Google Sheets.
