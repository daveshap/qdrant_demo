Is it time to leave?
I've been at a job for a while now and it was what many people would consider a 'dream job' in my industry. When I started I was super excited about it and was raring to go. Slowly over time I realized why the position I am currently in opened up. Employees keep leaving, at least one every month. The company is not big by any means, around 35 employees. There is a general unhappiness, anxiety, overworked, understaffed air about the place and this was even before COVID-19.

The pandemic has of course made things worse. Our salaries have been cut, which is understandable considering the situation but our clients have also lost some of their ability to pay us while we still bust our asses for them. This is what our boss expects, a lot of work and less pay. We have been told we should be grateful we still have jobs, in not as nice terms.

I'm privileged enough to be in a situation where I don't have kids, I'm not married, do not have a mortgage to pay or even rent. I wake up every day dreading work and wondering what is keeping me here. I'm normally not the sort of person who gets anxious easily but it's been through the roof lately. 

I wonder if I should cut my losses and leave now before this ship fully sinks or wait to see if things improve.
