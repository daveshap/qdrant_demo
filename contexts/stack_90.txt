Alarm not based on neither sound nor vibration When my neighbour's iPhone alarm sound wakes him up each morning, it wakes me up too. To top it off he snoozes for aeons, which usually means I'll never get to sleep again, even after he gets up.I thought to ask him to switch to vibration only, but the walls are so paper thin and our beds are both right up against each side of the wall, that even this is likely to wake me up.The solution I've been pondering is to find an alarm app that uses the flash light to wake people up. Questions:Is the flash light on an iPhone sufficient to wake up a person?Are there other options for waking him that will not wake me?I reckon for example that the Apple Watch has a vibrating alarm, but this is a rather costly solution. Maybe there's a cheap ($10), small, comfortable, cool-looking wearable that does this specifically?
