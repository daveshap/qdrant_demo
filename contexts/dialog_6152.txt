JESSIE: Hal's signalling he's OK.
FRANK: They're about two hundred yards from the top of the tower, right where that ledge comes out, Gabe.
JESSIE: He knows it well.
GABE: The ledge, I know it well, or should I say <u>we</u> know it well.
JESSIE: You can stop right there.
GABE: We spent a night there one night...
JESSIE: Enough.
GABE: Yeah, we were caught in a storm. I went up there an innocent climber...
JESSIE: Oh, please.
GABE: And when I came down, my morals were corrupted forever.
JESSIE: Don't believe it... You know the trouble with you is you have no brain filter. Everything you think just pours right out.
GABE: Room service...Hi, Sarah.
SARAH: Hi, Gabe.
HAL: Glad you could drop in.
GABE: Hey, anything for a friend. How's the knee?
HAL: I think it's out. No big deal. It's that old football injury.
GABE: Funny, he told me he twisted it gettin' out of a hot tub.
HAL: I love you, too.
GABE: Rescue One -- have located helpless climber, please prepare <u>idiot line</u> for transport, over.
HAL: Wait 'til you get into trouble, just wait.
GABE: How're ya feeling?
SARAH: Fine, I guess...
GABE: Sarah, we could take off and leave this guy behind...
HAL: Rescue One -- please be advised Ranger Walker is making advances toward my girlfriend that are liable to get his ass kicked right into space, over.
JESSIE: Copy. Hal, tell Gabe he only makes advances <u>to me</u> or else he'll be walking down four thousand feet, and sleeping outside.
GABE: She's tough.
SARAH: Is it really four thousand?
