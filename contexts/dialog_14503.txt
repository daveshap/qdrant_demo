BRODY: What is all this stuff?
HOOPER: Depth-finder, fathometer, sonar, closed-circuit TV -- fore and aft -- RDF, single side band... And two loose nuts behind the wheel.
BRODY: Can you tell from that if a big man- eater is around?
HOOPER: Sometimes. Look here -- something big, probably a school of mackerel clumped together. And staying right with us.
BRODY: Where'd you get all this?
HOOPER: I Bought it. Both sets of grandparents set up trust funds for me; stocks went up, so I don't have to touch my principal.
BRODY: You're at the Institute full time? Or do you have a job?
HOOPER: It is a job. I'm not fooling around like some amateur. It's my life!
BRODY: We gotta get back soon...
