MIRTHA: Oh fucking relax. Let your hair down for once. It's your fucking birthday, for Chrissakes. You're such a fucking pussy. I swear to G-d, I married this big time drug dealer and wound up with the maid.
GEORGE: No honey, I'm alright.
AUGUSTO: A toast! To Mister George Jung. Mr. I 95, north and south. My brother-in-law. Happy birthday!
