Minecraft will not work after Windows 10 installation. Launcher claims game crashed Ever since my grandma installed Windows 10 on her computer (the one I want to fix Minecraft on), Minecraft won't go past the launcher screen. I have tried many things such as: Uninstalling and Re-installingDeleting the contents of my .minecraft folderMany other things. It has been going on ever since about 1.10, and my grandmas computer expert claims that Minecraft isn't compatible with Windows 10 (Which I know is an absolute lie, because with every other computer my dad has installed Windows 10 and Minecraft on they both are perfectly fine together). I have a hard time believing it's the computer itself, because that seems ridiculous. I'm curious as to whether anyone knows: A solution to this, things that might have been installed with it that are not compatible with Minecraft, if something is wrong with my Minecraft, or simply if you just have any ideas that are completely obvious that I've not thought of in the past 2 years. If you need any more info on this, just tell me and I'll try to do my best to deliver that to you.
