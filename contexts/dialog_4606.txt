CAESAR: I saved you.
VIOLET: Ha! What a load of crap. Look at yourself, Caesar. You're a thug. |You launder money for the mob. You rent women like you rented this apartment.
VIOLET: Saved me? You don't even know me. You used me, Caesar, just like I used you. All part of the business.
CAESAR: You betrayed me!
VIOLET: You murdered Gino!
CAESAR: I had to. You made me.
VIOLET: Bullshit, you killed him. Not me. You did it because you couldn't stand the thought of Johnnie fucking you.
CAESAR: Shut up!
