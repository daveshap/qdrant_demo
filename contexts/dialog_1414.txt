RAINS: So he's won.
PINKERTON: No.
PINKERTON: Every three months, the James Gang circles back to the vicinity of Liberty, Missouri. They always pull a job right before they return, probably to have extra money to give family and friends.
RAINS: In English, Pinkerton.
PINKERTON: There are only four banks within that travel radius which they have not robbed.
RAINS: Can you put men at all four?
PINKERTON: No need. I have another tool at my disposal which will narrow it down to one bank.
RAINS: What is that?
PINKERTON: Why, their intense hatred of you, of course.
