If you are homeless and job searching, DHS will allow you to use their address as your address
Job searching is hard, but when you have no address, finding a legitimate job is impossible - employers legally can't employ you if you have no address to send your payment to. Your local DHS (or similar welfare or state human resources building) will often allow you to have a 'po box' for free there, so long as you come by once a week every week to clear it out. This can help you get back on your feet, even if you have no place to go.

EDIT: If your local Department Of Human Services does not offer this service, you can inquire at your local post office, church, or homeless shelter about these services.

EDIT 2: DHS stands for Department of Human Services where I'm from, lmao. Do not contact the Department of Homeland Security looking for p.o. boxes!

EDIT 3: Okay, your state calls it something else, I get it. Call the people who handle your food stamps/wic/medical assistance stuff.
