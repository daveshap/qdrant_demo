Wrong place at the wrong time or how I can't be with the person I've always wanted to be with
A good 6-7 years ago I met and fell in love with a Canadian girl. To this day she is the only person I've ever loved. Due to moving across the Atlantic to study in England, we never got in a relationship because the separation would have been too brutal. However,  in that time we spent almost every day together.

Since then we have both gone through uni, gotten stable jobs on our different continents. We have both had relationships but nothing ever stuck. I've come close to loving others, but it never was the case. In my case I still thought of her on occasion and wondered if she remembered me the same way I remember her. I always got to a stage where I thought I had finally left her behind only to be pulled right back in as soon as we talked for any length of time. Those feelings would come rushing back and once again she made me completely vulnerable and truly happy. 

In the last few years I've come back to Canada twice to visit her and my friends and both times we instantly hit it off again, as if we never left each other. Both times we have expressed how much we want to be together. This last time circumstances sadly only allowed us to see each other for a couple of hours but in those couple of hours I felt whole again. I am thinking of someone for hours on end for the first time in years. After all these years, I just want to be with her. 

Unfortunately it cannot happen.  We both have amazing jobs and we're both dedicated to them. No matter how much I want to be with her, my well being comes first. 

And that, reddit, is what's bothering me; I just want to be with the only person who's made me feel alive, but circumstances never work in my favor. Maybe one day. 

Thanks for letting me rant :)
