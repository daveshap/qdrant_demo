MS. FARMER: Mr. Cole... not only am I a TEACHER... but I am also a PARENT of a Middlesex child. Therefore, I am the ONLY person here who transcends the parent-teacher bridge.

MS. FARMER: The bottom line... Mr. Cole... is that there is material being taught to our children that is cause for this destructive behaviour.
