How bad is it to renege on a grad school acceptance?
I'm currently in the process of visiting schools that admitted me for their higher ed master's program. I also want to apply for a fellowship at my home institution that won't give me a decision until the summer (last year's timeline was late June or July). However, I have to let schools know by April 15th if I'll be attending next year, and if I'm taking their GA offer. I don't want to screw someone over, but I also would want to accept the fellowship if I'm offered it. What would the consequences be if I was to renege on a fully-funded masters program? Will I be blacklisted from other institutions? Is deferral potentially an option? If I do take the fellowship, how honest should I be with the school in question about why I'm reneging?
