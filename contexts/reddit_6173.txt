Dick move to take a job with the intention of finding a better one ASAP and quitting?
Title. Basically I don't want the job, but I need money. This company seems like they really need me. I don't want to work there long term as it's not a good career match. But I need a job lined up. Dick move to take the job and then bounce when something better comes along?
