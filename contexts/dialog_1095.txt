BOOKKEEPER: There are too many people watching me--they know I know a lot--
BERNSTEIN: --it was all in hundreds, wasn't it?
BOOKKEEPER: A lot of it was. I just thought it was sort of an all-purpose political fund--you know, for taking fat cats to dinner, things like that.
BERNSTEIN: Could buy a lot of steaks, 350,000 dollars.
BOOKKEEPER: I can't be positive that it was used for the break-in but people sure are worried.
BERNSTEIN: Which people?
BOOKKEEPER: The ones who could disburse the money.
BERNSTEIN: Who were they?
BOOKKEEPER: There were a group of them--I think five, I don't know their names.
BERNSTEIN: Sloan knew which five, didn't he?
