I can't feel love.
I don't think I'm capable of feeling love. What's it feel like? How do you know if someone loves you?

I'm not a mean person, I help others when I can, but because of what I went through as a kid (I'm 55 now) I think I stopped feeling love. I'm gay, and I've been through a lot just because of that. I truly love others, but I don't think I've *felt* love in 30 years or so.

I'm not saying "nobody loves me." They do. They say it to me. I just don't feel it. I'm numb. 

I've always had to take care of myself. My family has always been "hot and cold" toward me because of my gayness so I could never depend on them for solid support.

So, what does love feel like? How do I recognize it?
