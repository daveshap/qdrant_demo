Futuristic novel where cats are telepathic and can detect liars and criminals I'm looking for a novel set in the future (2036? date is mentioned on cover) and there's a picture of a cat on the cover.It is about cats who are telepathic and can detect liars and criminals. The main characters are women who own the cats. Houses are run by computers linked to the owners; they show person's health and whether they're at home. No individual cars owned, they call up a communal car to travel.
