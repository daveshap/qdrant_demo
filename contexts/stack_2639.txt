QGIS raster calculator is not keeping each pixel with 1 byte I have a raster where 1 pixel = 1 byte. I want to change every value different than zero to 1, transforming a gray scale into black &amp; white. I think the expression should be:\"my_raster@1\" > 0The output format is GeoTIFF. It works, but the final size is four times bigger than the uncompressed GeoTIFF (each pixel is using a 32-bit integer, when it should use a 8-bit, as in the original). How to solve this?(I also noted that the values became 1 and nan, instead of 1 and 0. If anyone can explain this too, I'll be grateful. And if it's not an abuse, why doesn't it save a compressed TIFF?)
