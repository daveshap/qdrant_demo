What happends when two li-po batteries with a small difference in voltages are connected in parallel Basically i'm trying to build a huge power bank with 3.7v 10000mAh 1s cells. I'm increasing the capacity to 50000 mah by stacking one cell over the other in parallel. All the cells are identical in chemistry and nominal voltage. Does it actually affects the batteries when I connect a fully charged cell (4.2v) and a half charged cell (3.9v) in parallel ???
