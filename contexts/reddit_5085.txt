How to keep a positive relation while declining company "A" since you've already been placed at "B".
So the one im currently full time at is a mid sized one with a pay im not complaining since i legit never have interned nor worked, with 1 gap year. ive been here less than a week  


Now an MNC i applied for and interviewed for (a different role) wants to give me an assignment for the role i told them i preferred but it will be an internship for 3 months with a chance of a full time job.  


So how do i keep a good reputation with them to keep my future options with them open.

Im thinking of telling them that while im already placed, i would like to bring a more refined and experienced version of me to a company like yours which deserves the best and therefore would like to keep things professional etc
