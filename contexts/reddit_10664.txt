there is so much pain in the world
and i don’t know, i just wish there was more that i could do to stop it. i feel so responsible for all of the bad things people have done to me, because they have been through something bad themselves. september is just such a horrible month. there are so many horrible anniversaries, and so many tragedies. i know three people now who died in this month. my friend recently became homeless. i’m struggling with my studies. my sister told me about her abuse. it’s almost been one year since i tried killing myself and i’m still here, crying about everything and never really reaching out. i never do anything right. i just wish i could undo death, or do something to make things better for people. i wish i could die knowing it would impact nobody. i’m so alone. nobody really seems to care. i really wish every action didn’t have an impact.

i don’t know, i think this is a cry for help? i feel like i’m going to do something stupid and maybe at this point it’s not even stupid. i’m so sorry that i feel this way, partially because i’m sorry that i’m not living my teenage years happy, but mostly because i know i’m probably gonna end up killing myself even when i know it’s gonna hurt people.
