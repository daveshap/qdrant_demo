Steering deadzone I got a Logitech F310 controller from one of my friends recently. So I plugged it in and ran project cars. The main problem I noticed right off the bat was the steering deadzone despite having it turned to zero in the game. I downloaded the Logitech software and the deadzone was set to zero but it was still there in game. I've also tried this other software called x360 with an anti deadzone option but I don't have the slightest clue about how to make it work. Granted, the deadzone isn't very big and it's still drivable but fine adjustments are almost impossible to make.I've seen several posts complaining about the same problem here and there but they are all old and some people claim that Logitech has fixed it.Tldr;  Is it possible to completely eliminate steering deadzone on Logitech controllers?(if possible test project cars. F1 games are fine as well)If not, can any of you guys still manage to drive reasonably good without too much twitching?
