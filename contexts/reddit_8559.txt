Has any country or jurisdiction ever had success in lowering the cost of living?
There is a widespread belief that there is a crisis in the cost of living, and that lowering the cost of living is a meaningful way to address poverty [\[Source\]](https://www.jrf.org.uk/report/reducing-poverty-through-policies-cut-cost-living)

Are there any reasonable and tested policies that have had historical success in lowering the overall cost of living in any level of governmental jurisdiction?

What are the obstacles, if any, to implementing those policies on a large scale?
