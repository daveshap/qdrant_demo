PAUL: It's prettier here than I thought it would be.
LETTY: Yeah, I guess it's all right.
PAUL: Are you all right?
LETTY: That's a big question.
PAUL: I hope it wasn't something I did.
LETTY: Something you did?
LETTY: Of course not, no. Is that why you're here?
PAUL: I think we need to talk about some things.
LETTY: Yes, I suppose so.
PAUL: This has been really difficult, this whole thing.
LETTY: No.
PAUL: Especially this last year.
LETTY: Especially now.
PAUL: So, I've been thinking a lot...
PAUL: I talked to Ruth a little bit, and I think it's about time...
LETTY: I know. We can't just keep going through the motions.
PAUL: Exactly. It's time to make decisions.
LETTY: You don't have to say anything else. I've known for a while that this was coming.
PAUL: I just wish we'd done it sooner.
