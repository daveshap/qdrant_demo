EDDIE: Give me some bourbon. J. T. S. Brown.
BARTENDER: You want a chaser?
EDDIE: No.
EDDIE: Have a nice trip?
SARAH: Fair.
EDDIE: Can I sit down?
SARAH: Why not? We already know each other's secrets.
EDDIE: Thanks for the, uh, for the breakfast.
SARAH: Two ships that pass in the night should always buy each other breakfast.
EDDIE: Can I buy you another drink?
EDDIE: Hey, another one for me and another one for the lady.
BARTENDER: Check!
EDDIE: You look different... More relaxed.
SARAH: It's the lights. And the scotch.
EDDIE: How come you didn't catch your bus?
SARAH: I wasn't waiting for a bus.
EDDIE: Then why go to the bus station?
SARAH: Same reason you went: at that hour of the morning you haven't much choice. Besides, I only live three blocks from there. Where do you live?
EDDIE: Around.
SARAH: I know where you live: in a locker, in a bus station. What's it like living in a locker?
EDDIE: Cramped. You always drink like this, so early in the morning?
SARAH: Do you always ask so many questions?
EDDIE: No, not always.
SARAH: Sometimes I wake up and I can't sleep, not without a drink. The bars don't open until eight. Mack over there has faith in me. When I'm broke, he trusts me. Don't you trust me, Mack?
