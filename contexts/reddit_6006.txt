Soon to be graduate with associates in Business Management, no idea where to go from here...
So as the title says, this upcoming semester is going to be my last for my associates in business management. I pretty much just went for it because it's what most of my credits fell into and it fit my schedule for work (which is minimum wage part time). I have no idea about what I plan on doing with it after I graduate. I don't know if going to school for a bachelors would be worth it, or if job searching (HR, clerical, data entry, etc) would be the better option. I enjoy some of the things in the major such as the accounting and information systems end of it, but I'm really not sure. Anyone have any advice for a situation like this?
