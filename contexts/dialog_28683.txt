WES: It's got a bottom.
JAEGER: Guess we know what the next stop is.
EPPS: All right. Let's break out some utility shovels, lanterns, and a claymore in case we have to do any blasting. Me and Jaeger'll climb down, and see what we can see.
WES: What am I supposed to do?
EPPS: Got to have someone here in case we need help making it back up. Doesn't hurt to have a look out either.
JAEGER: Think there might be more Iraqis?
EPPS: Right now I wouldn't be surprised if Eartha Kitt showed up singing Send In The Clowns.
WES: You down?
JAEGER: Yeah, we're down.
WES: What do you see?
