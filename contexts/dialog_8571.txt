LANDO: What about Leia and the Wookiee?
VADER: You will find them well enough. But they must never again leave this city.
LANDO: That was never mentioned. Neither was this bounty hunter taking Han. I hope you haven't forgotten our bargain.
VADER: I forget nothing, Calrissian. Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly.
LANDO: No.
VADER: Good. It would be most unfortunate if I had to leave a permanent garrison here.
