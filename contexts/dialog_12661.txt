PROFESSOR DAJORSKI: You stayed here again last night?
JENNIFER: I was working on the cataloging.
PROFESSOR DAJORSKI: Jennifer, there is more to life than work.
JENNIFER: I know, Paul.
PROFESSOR DAJORSKI: Do you? Then why don't you go out? Meet someone. Make a life for yourself instead of hiding away in the past?
JENNIFER: I like my work.
PROFESSOR DAJORSKI: I'm having some people over tonight for dinner -- I'd like you come.
JENNIFER: We'll see.
