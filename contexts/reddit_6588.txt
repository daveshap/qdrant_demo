Is Basecamp the wonderful place where to work they say it is?
Basecamp makes cloud applications for project management. It was previously known as 37signals.

They say that it's very well organised and that it's a wonderful place where to work and that stress is absent.

They wrote a book titled "It Doesn't Have to Be Crazy at Work"

Is it true? Or is to work there just as crazy as anywhere else?
