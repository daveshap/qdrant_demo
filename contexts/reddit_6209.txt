Confidential Information and Invention Assignment Agreement?
So I recently accepted a new job in which I need to sign a Confidential Information and Invention Assignment Agreement, of which I've never had to do before. My main concern is that I have been doing some writing in my spare and time and if I ever wanted to publish something outside of work, could the company take ownership of it through this agreement?
