Hi. I have a hard time finding a job as a fresh graduate, any tips?
Hi. I have a hard time finding a job, entry level jobs are what I'm looking for, every employer wants someone with experience and that to me is quite contradictory. I have my degree and 3 volunteer placements on 3 different departments in physiotherapy. What advice can you give me? How should I handle this? There is really nothing I can do between volunteering/getting my degree and getting my first job, as much as I am concerned. What am I missing? Edit: UK for reference.
