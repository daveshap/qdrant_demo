GONZO: I want that fucking radio!
DUKE: Don't touch it! Get back in that tub!
GONZO: Back the tape up. I need it again! Let it roll! Just as high as the fucker can go! And when it comes to that fantastic note where the rabbit bites its own head off, I want you to THROW THAT FUCKING RADIO INTO THE TUB WITH ME!
DUKE: Not me. It would blast you through the wall -- stone dead in ten seconds and they'd make me explain it!
GONZO: BULLSHIT! Don't make me use this.
DUKE: Jesus.
GONZO: Do it! I want to get HIGHER!
