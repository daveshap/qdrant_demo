31M. Lost my job due to corona virus quarantine and my market is completely crippled. What is my next career move?
I was a bartender for 6 years, and due to corona virus being a widespread pandemic, all of the restaurants in my city have been shut down until further notice. Many of my friends have been offered their jobs back once the ban has been lifted, but my establishment has informed us they will not be reopening. I have been thinking for some time now of getting out of the restaurant business, and figure this is perfect timing for a career change. I have no idea what to consider moving to right now, and was wondering if any of you have been in a similar position and had to make a similar transition? I have a high school diploma, and have been working in the food industry my entire adult life. I have been looking at different job majors and online courses during this quarantine as well. Any advice would help!
