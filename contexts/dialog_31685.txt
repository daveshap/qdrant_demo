FREDDY: That's 'Fronkonsteen.'
MEDICAL STUDENT: I beg your pardon?
FREDDY: My name is pronounced Fron kon steen.
MEDICAL STUDENT: Oh! I thought it was Dr. Frankenstein.
FREDDY: No, it's Dr. Fronkonsteen!
MEDICAL STUDENT: But aren't you the grandson of the famous Dr. Victor Frankenstein?... who performed such fascinating experiments in electricity and galvanism?
FREDDY: That's true! But my grandfather, Victor was, after all, what we might politely refer to as... a cuckoo!
FREDDY: I prefer, by far, to be remembered for my own small contributions to science. Now if we can proceed to your questions.
MEDICAL STUDENT: Well sir... I'm not sure I understand the distinction between 'Reflexive' and 'Voluntary' nerve impulses.
FREDDY: Very good! Since our lab work today is a demonstration of just that distinction... why don't we proceed?
