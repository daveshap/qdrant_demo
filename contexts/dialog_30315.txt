SCOTTIE: You don't remember.
MADELEINE: No...
SCOTTIE: Do you remember where you were?
MADELEINE: Oh, of course I remember that! But then I must have had a dizzy spell, and fainted!
SCOTTIE: Where were you?
MADELEINE: At...
MADELEINE: ...Old Port Point! Out at the Presidio! Of course I remember! I often go there!
SCOTTIE: Why?
MADELEINE: Because I love it so. It's beautiful there. Especially at sunset. Ah... thank you for the fire.
SCOTTIE: Where had you been before?
MADELEINE: When?
SCOTTIE: This afternoon.
MADELEINE: Oh... wandering about.
SCOTTIE: Before? Where? Where had you been?
