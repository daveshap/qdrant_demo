Analysis of an LC circuit antenna I want to analyse a parallel LC circuit in terms of inputs and outputs as I am studying them in the context of using them as a tuned antenna.However I am unsure of where to identify the inputs and outputs in order to find a transfer function between them. Thinking of the mass on a spring analogy the input may be the applied force and the output is the displacement which becomes very large when the applied force nears the resonant frequency.Is there some kind of equivalent for this circuit?
