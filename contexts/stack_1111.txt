What caused the database [.mdf file] to grow suddenly I am trying to find the cause which have bloated the mdf of a database from 20 GB to 100 GB.So far i tried checking the autogrow events to find time, but could not find none using standard reports and even default trace files.We don't have 3rd party monitoring tools to confirm if any maintenance job like rebuild would have done or any other process.How can i find what caused the growth on this mdf?
