I'm getting irritated with my mom who has stage 4 breast cancer for over 3years now
I was 19 when I dropped out from college was on my 3rd year. I dropped out because we found out that my mom was sick. She's in abroad because she's supporting us, 3siblings, separated parents she's the only one who has been supporting us ever since my parents separated. By the time I was on my 3rd year college my mom was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer had to stop whatever I had starter to come here in Abroad to work to support my mom. 2 years later we're all here now. I'm a middle child by the way 22 years old. My mom is still here in abroad. She isn't work she's just with us. I have 2 brothers, youngest brother has a son by 17, he's 20 now, older brother 23 but alot happened to him too went to college and got wasted and everything anyways that's in the past now but all I can say was he was dumb and feeling rich kid. 
Anyways I'm developing this irritating and annoyed feelings towards my mom. I'm starting to get annoyed with how she constantly complains about what she feels, the sound, the pain. It's pissing me off. It's mean I know but sometimes it's just really annoying. It feels like you've been working for nothing since she isn't improving. I sometimes feel like maybe it's better if mom just rest for good, it's not something I want to happen but I just wanna live my life and go on with it. I'm tired not just physically but emotionally too plus psychologically. I know she feels more than that too. Can anyone please tell me what to do or explain what I'm feeling? I don't wanna have any regrets when something happens and I'm upset and everything. I love my mom so much more than I could ever love myself but sometimes I wish things isn't as complicated as this. Please enlighten me thank you.
