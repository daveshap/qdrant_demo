ATHOS: Prison was horrible but it was his home. He's been torn from it by strangers. He's frightened, exhausted -- and the mask is familiar. Let him rest in it tonight, and remove it tomorrow.
ARAMIS: Excellent, Athos. You have a keen sense of this man.
ATHOS: His plight is obvious, isn't it?
ARAMIS: And why are you so glum?
PORTHOS: I expected action. There was no killing, no fighting, I was useless.
ATHOS: Are you hungry?
MAN IN THE IRON MASK: Just... water.
