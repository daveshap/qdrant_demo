BOWLER: Mon Captain, it's for you.
FURIOUS: Hello?
MONICA: It's me.
FURIOUS: Monica, where are you?
MONICA: At the Frankenstein Center.
FURIOUS: Are you nuts? Get out of there!
MONICA: I'm going inside.
FURIOUS: What are you talking about?
MONICA: Listen, Casanova may be a supervillain, but he's got a weakness, and I'm it. Maybe -- just maybe -- I can trick him into showing me the location of the whatchamathing.
FURIOUS: He's a psycho! He'll kill you!
MONICA: Just shut up and listen. Hold off the attack as long as you can. If I can discover the location I'll call you --
FURIOUS: And what if you get killed?
MONICA: Then at least I will have died trying, right?
MONICA: Roy... We might never see each other again, so I'd better tell you now... I think you're wonderful.
FURIOUS: What?
MONICA: Bye.
FURIOUS: Monica!
