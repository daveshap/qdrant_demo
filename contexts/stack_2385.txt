How can I level up my AI crew? When you try to set default behaviors for AI-controlled craft in X4:Foundations, you'll see that the Default Behavior button brings up a list of tasks with a number of stars next to each. For example, Automine requires a pilot with one star while Explore requires a three star pilot.In X3, you could start a pilot trading in sector. After a while, the ability to auto-trade throughout the galaxy would become available. In X4 (as of version 1.50), it doesn't seem to be possible to tell low level pilots to auto-trade in sector. I'm stuck telling them what to do and where.How do I level up pilots to get those stars?
