YODA: Ready are you? What know you of ready? I have trained Jedi for 800 years. My own counsel I'll keep on who is to be trained.
LUKE: Why not me?
YODA: To become a Jedi takes the deepest commitment, the most serious mind.
BEN: He can do it.
YODA: This one I have watched a long time. All his life has he looked away ... to the horizon, to the sky, to the future. Never his mind on where he was, on what he was doing. Adventure, excitement ... A Jedi craves not these things!
LUKE: I have followed my feelings.
YODA: You are reckless!
BEN: He'll learn.
YODA: He's too old. Yes. Too old to start the training.
