Graduate loans question
So my work does tuition reimbursement but I was wondering if I could style it such that I take a loan out and pay for tuition, but then take the reimbursement money and pay off the loan. Or take a say, 3-4 year loan, that covers tuition as it occurs since I have to work full-time as I'm going to grad school to get the reimbursement, then pay of principal as I go? Is that actually more like a line of equity than a loan? Basically was wondering if there's a way to have a revolving line of credit that has no interest for a period of time that I can pay off as I go/use as I go to pay tuition as needed, probably up to 5-7k a semester?
