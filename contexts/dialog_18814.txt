SHELLY: Thomas J?
THOMAS J: I'm allergic to it.
SHELLY: To chocolate?
VADA: He's allergic to everything.
SHELLY: Chocolate?
SHELLY: Ooh, that's a pretty ring you're wearing.
VADA: It's a mood ring, it tells what mood I'm in.
THOMAS J: It doesn't work, it always stays black.
VADA: It's only black when you're around 'cause you put me in a bad mood.
SHELLY: Maybe black means you're happy?
VADA: I don't think so. Shelly, how can I get thirty five dollars?
THOMAS J: She's crazy, she wants to go to school over the summer.
VADA: It's not a real school, it's a writing class, I wanna be a writer.
THOMAS J: She only wants to do it because her sweetie pie's the teacher.
VADA: Shut your big fat mouth!
SHELLY: I think you'd make a fine writer, did you ask your Dad?
VADA: He won't give it to me.
SHELLY: Well you don't know that. Ask him.
