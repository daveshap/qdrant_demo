RICK: But you haven't any actual proof, and you know it. This isn't Germany or occupied France. All you can do is fine him a few thousand francs and give him thirty days. You might as well let him go now.
RENAULT: Ricky, I'd advise you not to be too interested in what happens to Laszlo. If by any chance you were to help him escape --
RICK: -- What makes you think I'd stick my neck out for Laszlo?
RENAULT: Because one, you've bet ten thousand francs he'd escape. Two, you have the letters of transit, now don't bother to deny it. And, well, you might do it simply because you don't like Strasser's looks. As a matter of fact, I don't like him either.
RICK: Well, they're all excellent reasons.
RENAULT: Don't count too much on my friendship, Ricky. In this matter I'm powerless. Besides, I might lose ten thousand francs.
RICK: You're not very subtle, but you are effective. I, I get the point. Yes, I have the letters, but I intend using them myself. I'm leaving Casablanca on tonight's plane, the last plane.
RENAULT: Huh?
RICK: And I'm taking a friend with me. One you'll appreciate.
RENAULT: What friend?
RICK: Ilsa Lund. That ought to put your mind to rest about my helping Laszlo escape. The last man I want to see in America.
RENAULT: You didn't come here to tell me this. You have the letters of transit. You can fill in your name and hers and leave any time you please. Why are you interested in what happens to Laszlo?
