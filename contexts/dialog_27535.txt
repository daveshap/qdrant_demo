SALLY: I changed the lock you son of a bitch!
JOHANA: ... Sally?
SALLY: You're back! Hello. We were burgled.
JOHANA: Again?
SALLY: They got the new T.V.
SALLY: ... And the new stereo.
JOHANA: I hope they remembered to take the microwave this time?
SALLY: Yep. How was your trip...? Help me clean up, okay?
JOHANA: You called the police?
SALLY: They're going to send detectives.
