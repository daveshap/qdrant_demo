Anyone else not sold on partially re-opening states?
It doesn’t seem like anything is actually getting better. 

More like people just feel tired of being locked in. 

Partially re-opening doesn’t mean people are automatically safe again. 

It’s not like the problem is going to disappear after Apr. 30.
