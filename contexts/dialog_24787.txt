KYLE'S MOTHER: My fellow Americans. I have led this fight in the War against profanity. I have founded Mothers Against Canada. Our neighbor to the north has abused us for the last time.
PRESIDENT: As Commander in chief, I have ordered our Army to set up defensive positions along the US-Canada border in anticipation of an attack.
KYLE'S MOTHER: What about air strikes?
PRESIDENT: Huh?
KYLE'S MOTHER: We have to have air strikes on their military and entertainment centers. It's the only way to ensure that their smut can't reach American soil!
PRESIDENT: Oh, uh... I don't know if air strikes are necessary.
KYLE'S MOTHER: Not necessary?! Mr. President, may I remind you that our country's heart and soul are at stake, and our children's minds are the battlefield! The bastard Canadians want to fight us because we won't tolerate their potty mouths. Well, if it is war they want... THEN WAR THEY SHALL HAVE!!!
