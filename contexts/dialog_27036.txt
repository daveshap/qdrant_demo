WILSON: What, tryin' to catch him with another bird?
ED: That's what I thought, man. But it was not a hotel or nothin' that we went to. It was someplace else.
WILSON: Where abouts?
ED: Bad place, man. Bad people. Some guys loading some trucks. Some kinda deal goin' down. I don't know and I don't care. Maybe they're shipping fava beans to Eskimos.
WILSON: Did Jenny know?
ED: Valentine wasn't even there. If he was into something, if she was involved -- who can say. But I'll tell you something. She stood in front of these dudes, man. Eyeballing <u>them</u>. Checking <u>them</u> out. I felt like she was covering <u>my</u> ass that day.
