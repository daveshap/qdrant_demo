FRANK: Why didn't you tell us you were there earlier?
PETER: I don't know. I was afraid there'd be hours of questions. I can't afford to miss a game.
ANDY: We wouldn't want someone's death to interfere with your games.
FRANK: What was your relationship with her?
PETER: Casual.
ANDY: Casual? You were boning her weren't you?
PETER: It wasn't serious. What's your problem?
ANDY: You are! I don't like you.
PETER: Fine, don't ask me out on a date.
