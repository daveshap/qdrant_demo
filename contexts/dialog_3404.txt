LOTTE: I blew it, Dr. Lester.
LESTER: You followed your heart, my child, and that is not necessarily a bad thing.
LOTTE: But now we've lost access to Craig.
LESTER: My child, I don't think its a great mystery what Craig's up to.
LOTTE: I'm your Goddamn wife. Once you vowed to cherish me forever. Now you hold a gun to my head?
CRAIG: Yeah, well welcome to the nineties.
LOTTE: Suck my dick!
CRAIG: Shut up!
CRAIG: Tell her you need to see her.
LOTTE: You bastard.
MAXINE: J.M. Inc. Be all that someone else can be.
LOTTE: I have to see you.
MAXINE: Sweetie! Oh, but we can't. It's business hours. I need to keep the membranous tunnel open for paying customers.
CRAIG: Tell her, what the hell, close early today, live dangerously.
LOTTE: What the hell, darling. Close early today, live dangerously.
