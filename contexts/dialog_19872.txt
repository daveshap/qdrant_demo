WILLIAM: Nothing, nothing... Look, I live just over the street -- you could get cleaned up.
ANNA: No thank you. I need to get my car back.
WILLIAM: I also have a phone. I'm confident that in five minutes we can have you spick and span and back on the street again... in the non-prostitute sense obviously.
ANNA: Okay. So what does 'just over the street' mean -- give it to me in yards.
WILLIAM: Eighteen yards. That's my house there.
