TWC/unemployment/appeal tribunal
What is an appeal tribunal? The TWC site isn't making sense to me.

I've been getting benefits for a few months now, and they're saying this. I was a substitute teacher who wasn't able to work due to COVID. I've been getting the payments of 600 for a few months now.

&#x200B;

" The Texas Workforce Commission (TWC) Appeals Department has received an appeal  from the employer to a determination on your unemployment benefits.  When the hearing in this case is scheduled, a Notice of Hearing will be mailed to you at the  mailing address you have on record at TWC. "

Should I be worried about anything?
