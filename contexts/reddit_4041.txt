Does anyone else find it shitty that you need to clearly establish you are exclusive in today’s dating
I went on several dates(10 dates) with one girl and then I see that she was on a date with another guy at a restaurant I’m eating at with my family.

I confront her about this and she’s like yeah I was gonna tell you...I was angry and was like tell me what...she was like oh I just wasn’t feeling it anymore and that she isn’t my girlfriend. 

I told her we went on several dates...after a few dates, can’t you safely assume we are boyfriend-girlfriend. She responds well you never explicitly asked to be exclusive. She had been going on dates with several guys while going on dates with me. 

I also met her over tinder.
