My company is an absolute mess. Can I say that in an interview?
I work in a larger startup where people turnover is massive. Some people donâ€™t even stay 1 year and leave as soon as they can.
My job title changed without me agreeing 3 times in 6 months and the new one is pending for months. It looks ridiculous but I need to get out of here.

I am experienced but my last two jobs were too short so I need to hold my breath currently and apply.

And advice how to say my company is a mess without disqualifying myself?

Thank you
