Is it ok to connect to the recruiter on LinkedIn?
Hello!!!

Hope all is well with you in this uncertain times.

**Context:**

I received an e-mail on last Friday (8 May) by a recruiter from the retail fashion division of a big company in my country.

They have several business areas, and I applied to opportunities in the food retail division (supply chain and logistics), and by that contact, the recruiter from the other fashion division said in the email that wanted to call me soon, to know my interests and motivations, if it made sense.

As soon as I read the email (end of the day in friday 2hours later), I sent a response thanking for the contact and showing availability to talk about that, and if preferable for them, i was available to arrange a given time to expect a call!

I didnt receive till now a response from the recruiter and at this point I don't know what to do. I searched the recruiter profile in LinkedIn and found it, it has the premium version so later the person will know I visited him.

**My doubt is**: is it too wrong in this phase to connect with the person? I found other 2 recruiters from the same division, one with the same function and other with another...

I would like to expand my network since i have <100 connections (most of them with recruiters only), and because its a dream/perfect company to work that I thought I would never get a shot at working with them.

If I shouldn't connect directly with this recruiter that contacted me, then can I connect with the others? Does this makes sense?

I'm desperate to get a job so I can start working and take off my career, it has been a long journey of 1.5 years looking for a job (while I work in part-times) that meets my profile and wishes for a future career in management related to supply chain **or** sales&marketing.

I know when we are a young graduate you shouldn't narrow too much your options, but I felt confident that would eventually find an opportunity in this fields in the retail sector...
