Unattended Boot for Encrypted RAID? just recently dabbled into Ubuntu for my home NAS.  I'm using it for a media server as well as my main document repository for my other PCs. I want to use some sort of disk encryption and RAID 1 (I have one SSD for OS and 2 4TB drives for data).  If I only encrypt the RAID, and still have unattended mount, is there a way to keep the encryption key safe?I guess I can encrypt the OS drive, but I would lose any unattended boot up.  I only want the unattended boot up in case I need to restart while I'm not at home.
