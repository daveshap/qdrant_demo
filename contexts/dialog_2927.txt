BETH: What do you want, Nick?
NICK: Tell me about Catherine.
BETH: She told you, didn't she?
NICK: What did she tell me, Beth?
BETH: I slept with her once in school. I was just a kid. I was experimenting. It was just that one time. She developed a... fixation... on me. She styled her hair like mine. She wore the same kind of clothes I did. It scared me.
