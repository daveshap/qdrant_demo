NINOTCHKA: How much does this cost?
IRANOFF: Two thousand francs.
NINOTCHKA: A week?
IRANOFF: A day.
NINOTCHKA: Do you know how much a cow costs, Comrade Iranoff?
IRANOFF: A cow?
NINOTCHKA: Two thousand francs. If I stay here a week I will cost the Russian people seven cows. Who am I to cost the Russian people seven cows?
BULJANOFF: We had to take it on account of the safe.
IRANOFF: For ourselves... we are much happier now since we moved to a little room next to the servants' quarters.
NINOTCHKA: I am ashamed to put the picture of Lenin in a room like this. Comrades, your telegram was received with great disfavor in Moscow.
KOPALSKI: We did our best, Comrade.
NINOTCHKA: I hope so for your sake. Let us examine the case. What does the lawyer say?
BULJANOFF: Which lawyer?
NINOTCHKA: You didn't get legal advice?
BULJANOFF: We didn't want to get mixed up with lawyers. They are very expensive here. If you just say hello to a lawyer... well, there goes another cow.
KOPALSKI: We dealt directly with the representative of the Grand Duchess. I am sure if we call him he will give you a very clear picture.
NINOTCHKA: I will not repeat your mistake. I will have no dealings with the Grand Duchess nor her representative.
NINOTCHKA: Comrade Buljanoff...
BULJANOFF: Yes, Comrade?
NINOTCHKA: Do you spell Buljanoff with one or two f's?
BULJANOFF: With two f's, if you please.
NINOTCHKA: Will you send me some cigarettes, please? Comrades, I am not in a position to pass final judgment but at best you have been careless in your duty to the State. You were entrusted with more than a mere sale of jewelry. Why are we peddling our precious possessions to the world at this time? Our next year's crop is in danger and you know it. Unless we can get foreign currency to buy tractors there will not be enough bread for our people. And you three comrades...
KOPALSKI: We did it with the best intentions...
NINOTCHKA: We cannot feed the Russian people on your intentions. Fifty per cent to a so-called Duchess!... Half of every loaf of bread to our enemy! Comrade Kopalski, go at once to our Embassy and get the address of the best lawyer in Paris.
KOPALSKI: Yes, Comrade.
NINOTCHKA: You, Comrade Iranoff, go to the Public Library and get me the section of the Civil Code on property.
BULJANOFF: Is there anything I can do, Comrade?
NINOTCHKA: You might get me an accurate map of Paris. I want to use my spare time to inspect the public utilities and make a study of all outstanding technical achievements in the city.
BULJANOFF: Yes, Comrade.
