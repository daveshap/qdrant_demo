The year is 2080...
The year is 2080 and you're a potato farmer. You live on a dusty piece of grey land in the middle of nowhere. Every now and then, you hear the *hum* of a motor. You look up into the grey sky, squint, and make out the all-too-familiar surveillance patrol. These flying drones, bolstered by advanced satellites, monitor every square inch of the planet. Just a single step across territorial lines? You're immediately shot on sight.

Orwell was right. This is what our society has turned into--a dark, dystopian world. You and your poor family know it as the all-seeing Harvard. But it wasn't always like this.

During the Alumni Uprising of 2061, arguably the greatest conspiracy in history, the heads of all the world's governments systematically took full control of their respective nations. Unbeknownst to the rest of the world, each one of them had, at one point or another in their lives, graduated from Harvard University. With an iron fist they clamped down on all forms of dissent and eventually consolidated society into a single global state. Originating from a mandate from John Harvard himself, the Uprising had been in the works since the early 1600s. The Harvard Alums established the Thought Police and slaughtered billions. Top scientists and government agencies from around the world unveiled previously-secret technologies that were centuries ahead of their time. This enabled the Harvard to expand its reach to virtually the entire globe.

Now, you live a dreary life--on nothing but worms and repulsive protein blocks similar to those in the old classic *Snowpiercer*. Your tiny abode, made of only corrugated cardboard and true glue, collapses every other day. Despite the support you give your wife and children, they blame you. They blame you for something you did decades ago.

In 2053, you were the epitome of perfect. You came from an extremely wealthy family and graduated with a 10.0 GPA. Cream of the crop. Heck, you earned a shattering 50 million dollars worth of scholarships. Elite colleges were practically on their knees begging for you to attend. In the end, you narrowed it down to Harvard and Cornell. What you did next sealed your fate. You chose Cornell. Retrospectively, by no means did it seem like a mistake; Cornell was ranked the number one university by US News and its programs were the best in the world. In fact, the first trillionaire had graduated from Cornell's class of 2024. You were so excited to be doing to such a prestigious institution. But, you would soon regret your choice. That regret would carry on for the rest of your life.

Flash forward back to now. Each night as you tuck your daughter into bed, she hisses, "If you'd chosen Harvard, we would've gotten full immunity from The Purge". Then, as you tuck your son into his dirt cot, he reminds you that "We'd be living in the skyscrapers of Pyongyang if it weren't for you." And as you get into bed next to your wife, she would do what she always does. With the moon glinting off her striking eyes, she would glare at you for the rest of the night, unblinking, reminding you of the eternal pain and suffering you'd brought to your family.
