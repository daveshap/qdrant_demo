SHERIFF: You should've called in the police the second you found your sister has skipped. You go starting private investigations, using people you don't even know...
LILA: What difference does that...
SHERIFF: Your Detective told you a nakedfaced lie.
MRS. CHAMBERS: Barefaced.
SHERIFF: He told you he wasn't coming right back cause he wanted to question Norman Bates' mother, right?
LILA: Yes.
SHERIFF: Norman Bates' mother has been dead and buried in Greenlawn Cemetery for the last ten years!
MRS. CHAMBERS: I helped Norman pick out the dress she was buried in. Periwinkle blue.
SHERIFF: It ain't only local history, Sam, it's the only murder-and-suicide case in Fairvale ledgers! Mrs. Bates poisoned this guy she was... involved with, when she found out he was married, then took a helping of the same stuff herself. Strychnine. Ugly way to die.
MRS. CHAMBERS: Norman found them dead together. In bed.
SAM: You mean that old woman I saw sittin' in the window wasn't Norman Bates' mother?
MRS. CHAMBERS: Maybe you saw Mary!
SAM: I'd know the difference between Mary and an old woman.
SHERIFF: Now wait a minute, Sam. You sure you saw an old woman?
SAM: Yes! In the house behind the motel. I pounded and called but she... just ignored me.
SHERIFF: And you want to tell me you saw Norman Bates' mother.
