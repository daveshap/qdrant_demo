What are the limits of the right to bear arms?
As we all know, the Second Amendment provides "..., the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed." My question is, how far does the right extend? We also have the right to free expression, but [time and place limits](http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/timeplacemanner.htm) are allowed. We have the right to travel and no state may [restrict transit across state lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_movement_under_United_States_law), but we regulate the means (vehicle licensing, vehicle safety) and agriculture inspections and the like are allowed. 

Those two examples, expression and travel, are constitutionally protected rights in the same manner as the right to bear arms that [may be restricted in ways that comply with the due process requirements](https://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/amendments/14/essays/170/due-process-clause) of the Constitution. Does it follow that the right to bear arms may also be restricted by type of arm, manner of use, etc.? What are the restrictions that would meet the due process requirements of the Constitution?
