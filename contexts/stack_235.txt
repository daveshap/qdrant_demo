Jetdrive 850 install on Macbook Pro 2015 I have a Macbook Pro 2015 that I bought used. When I bought it, OS 10.13 (High Sierra) was installed, but the SSD was failing. I bought a JetDrive 850 to replace it, and put the High Sierra installer on an external USB hard drive.When use the option key and choose \"Install macOS High Sierra\" from the USB drive, it takes me to the question mark folder.Edited to add: When I try to boot to internet recovery, I get an 2002F error, which apparently indicates an internet connectivity. However, my WiFi is working fine for other devices.What should I try?
