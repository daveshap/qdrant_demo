Middle School Help
I am an 8th-grade middle schooler and there is a couple currently at my school; it consists of a weeb girl and a Fortnite guy, and they are happy together, the Fortnite gamer guy found out that I was friends with her gf (weeb girl); her and mine's friendship, by the way, is just two weebs  sharing fan fiction with each other, and Fortnite guy got pretty pissed about this; to the point where he dm' ed me to "spill out the beans" and tell him the absolute truth about her gf's and mine's friendship and I told him that it was just little fan fictions that we shared about it; the Fortnite guy tells me the shit and just practically makes me cry then and there to get me to reveal of how I USED to have a crush on her a while back; the man gets super pissed at this and pretends that it was "ok" and how it was all "natural"; but then this morning at school (this happened all in the spam of 4 days ago btw) he ended up telling all of my friends what happened at the chat and one of my friends comes to me and asks me about "what my relationship with \[weeb girl\] is" and I tell him that I dont have a relationship with her; and my friend tells me that \[fortnite guy\] told him that, then a russian kid who hates me comes later today at lunch and confronts me about why I'm "planning on destroying \[fortnite kid's\] and \[weeb girl's\] relationship" and I ask him where did he get that from; and the russian kid tells me he got it from \[fortnite kid\]; so I go and confront \[fortnite kid\] about it \[fortnite kid\] then tells me that I cant talk about this at school and to dm him after school; so I do that; \[fortnite kid\] refuses to awsner me, and BLOCKS my number; currently this all so far happened from about 4 days ago to barely 2 hours ago; please someone help me and tell me what I should do to (other than telling the principal; cause I'm already doing that)
