Well I asked out the girl at work...
And she said yes! To me she’s honestly gorgeous. And to my surprise she isn’t seeing anyone. So I got her number and we have been talking since yesterday via text.

All I’m saying is, if you want to ask someone out DO IT! You will all these thoughts running through your head like “what if this..” “what if that...” WHO CARES! 

From the moment I started here at my job she caught my eye and I was like “there’s no way this girl is single” and even people at work thought she was dating someone. But I got word from her manager (low key we talk about some personal stuff) and she was convinced we should go out. So I did it and to my surprise she wants to go out as well. Just wanted to let some positivity out on this beautiful Friday!
