Tomorrow I will never see my cat again
Tomorrow I have to say goodbye to my cat Felix. Never in my life have I bonded with an animal like I have with this cat. Right now I just want to sob and hold him close. He chose me as his owner and treats me so much differently that the rest of my family. Anyone can see just how much this cat likes me and I like him. He jumps into my arms and sleeps on my lap. But tomorrow I have to re-home him. It's a long story that some would disagree with, but my family is moving out of state this summer and I can't bring him with us no matter how much I want to. 

I'm just so upset and frankly angry. I know that in order to move (which will be so incredibly good for me and my family) we have to re-home him, but none of that makes this any easier. I just hope he's happy in his new home. I'm never going to see Felix again, and it's not fair. 

Why is loving an animal so hard sometimes?
