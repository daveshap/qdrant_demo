LEIA: All the data banks in Artoo are still secure.
HAN: Then I think we're due the reward you offered... and it had better be substantial after what we've been through.
LEIA: When Artoo has been safely delivered to my forces, you get your reward. You have my guarantee.
HAN: What's that little 'droid' carrying that's so blasted important?
LEIA: The plans and specifications to a battle station with enough fire power to destroy an entire system... Our only hope in destroying it is to find its weakness, which we will determine from the data I stored in Artoo.
LEIA: We captured the plans in a raid on the Imperial shipyards, but we fell under attack before I could get the data to safety, so I hid it in this Artoo unit and sent him off.
HAN: Where are you taking us now anyway?
LEIA: The fourth moon of Yavin. I've given the coordinates to Chewbacca.
HAN: I'd better go see how he's doing.
