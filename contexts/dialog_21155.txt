GORE: You in charge here?
KILLAINE: So it seems Sergeant.
GORE: Right.
KILLAINE: I hate to pull rank on you Sergeant, but once in a while...for moral purposes...you might address me as Inspector". In moments of extreme desperation
KILLAINE: I knew him. He was easy to dislike, poor chap.
GORE: They tell me he'll be a great loss to the liquor trade. This Mayfield girl...
GORE: ... I supposed you knew her, too, Inspector.
KILLAINE: I've met her.
GORE: It's her room. She only got to the Hotel this afternoon,. With him. I guess he took too much for granted. Here's the gun.
KILLAINE: Pearl-handled .25 Automatic, uh? No, it's a Belgian gun... 6.6 mm.
GORE: Correct, Inspector. A woman's gun. U.S. 125 caliber ammunition in it. It was on a table in there.
