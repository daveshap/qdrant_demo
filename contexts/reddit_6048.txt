Just Got Laid Off Over The Phone
Hey r/jobs,

&#x200B;

Quick question. Long story short,

* Got furloughed from the company Late March, immediately applied for UI
* Got a call from my boss that my position is being eliminated yesterday

 I haven't gotten any documentation due to being laid off indefinitely (basically fired). Now she wants me to return my things. Should I do it or wait until I get the documentation? I'm just afraid I may get framed as resigning. 

I still need to collect UI until I figure something out.

Thanks!
