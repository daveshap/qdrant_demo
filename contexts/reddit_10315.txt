No one will see this but if you do, thank you ðŸ–¤
Iâ€™m at home with my mum (who is asleep), usually my Stepdad is home too but I told him that my uncle is coming round, with even some false proof, he believed me so he has gone to his hour or two work shift. 

I did it so I could cry on my own, contemplating kms, because for years, since I was about 8 I have been thinking about it, getting stronger over time. I am always paranoid, looking around every corner, everyday contemplating. I just want it to end, so much has happened, people think I have it all, but it is all just a lie. About once a week I look up to see what the quickest way to kms is, to see if someone came up with a new and easy way. 

People say that Iâ€™m not alone, they all do, but these days I believe I really am, they say donâ€™t do it. I have ambitions in life, but I know that I will never complete them, I will be gone soon and I know it, never having done any good except a few occasions when I made my family happy. I know what could have been, but now, right now, Iâ€™m a waste of a life and there is no reason to go on.  I suffer so much, I have no hope but I know things that I want to do in life, things that I want to see, places that I want to go to, people that I want to meet, but I am literally on the edge. They say call these numbers, go to these groups. They to me are worth nothing. I really wanted to live, but I canâ€™t suffer like this anymore.

Sincerely, Kris
