LENNY: That would be no.
MACE: I've had it. No more wirehead shit in my car. You understand? You want to poach your lobes, do it somewhere else.
LENNY: Okay, you got my attention, but this is cutting off the circulation to my head, here. D'you mind?
LENNY: I thought we were friends.
MACE: No, see a friend is more than one person constantly doing favors for another. You just suck people along with your schemes and your scams and your slick act. Well I'm out. I got a kid, I got rent, I got an ex- husband someplace who doesn't send me a dime of support... I'm just trying to hold on here.
LENNY: So am I. Just trying to get by.
MACE: No, you're just trying to get off.
LENNY: Macey... I've never seen you like this.
MACE: Lenny, you're turning into some kinda squid-head low-life. You're always broke, you just go from one score to the next. And you're getting strung out... you don't even see it. Getting high on your own supply like some crack dealer.
LENNY: I know you wouldn't be saying all this if you didn't care about me. Thanks, Mace. Really.
MACE: Look, I gotta get some sleep.
LENNY: You still like me, don't you? We're still buddies?
MACE: Yeah. I don't see a way out of it.
LENNY: Macey, I know you're tired, but can you drop me at the Retinal Fetish? It's on your way.
MACE: Jesus, Lenny.
LENNY: Begging? Groveling? Any pathetic behavior at all? Will that help? Faith's there tonight, and I've got to talk to her.
MACE: Sure, Lenny. The only thing worse than a junkie is someone in love.
