BECKER: How did you come to know their names?
STARKS: You just told me. The last time I was with you was when I was in the Jacket. I'm in it right now, Dr. Becker.
BECKER: I don't understand...
STARKS: I'm in it as we speak. [Beat] You're haunting yourself right now. [Beat] I guess sometimes we indict ourselves if no one else does. You didn't make history like you wanted to, huh, Dr. Becker. It turned out different, didn't it?
BECKER: I didn't put you in Alpine Grove.
STARKS: No. [Beat] You put me on drugs and then you put me in the Jacket.
