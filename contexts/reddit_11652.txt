I suffer from Bulimia
I have been suffering from bulimia for 7 years now. at first, It was just some sort of an "emergency" kind of thing wherein I dont do it often. because at that time, I was trying to lose some weight. It worked and I became a little thinner but after a couple of years, I got fat again and now I am trap in this vicious cycle of binge eating and purging. I cant help it. I'm really afraid that it might affect my health or something. there are periods where I don't eat much and then all of a sudden I am chugging down lots of food only to puke it later. I cannot help it. I tried stopping it but after about 3 weeks, I did it again. I really don't know what to do.
