How does one know which will be kept current: Snap, Flatpak, or Debian For a month or more Libre Office debian package has been at version 5.4.4.  However, the snap package version is still only at 5.4.3.  It seems in this case, for some unknown reason, the snap package is not being kept current.  This makes me think of a more general problem/question:   In the future, when a system will have a mix of debian, snap, and even flatpak packages available for the various applications, how would a person know for each application which packaging type the provider will keep current?
