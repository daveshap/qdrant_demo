CASSANDRA: Have you taken a wrong turn, Mr. Tyler?

CASSANDRA: I'm not so sure Dr. Loveless would like to find his social secretary dancing in the dark with an uninvited stranger.
JIM: Forgive me, but you don't strike me as the social secretary type.
CASSANDRA: Thank you. But the truth is, I'm a single woman in a man's world. That leaves me very few choices, doesn't it?
JIM: I suppose so. But life can be hard for a man, too.
