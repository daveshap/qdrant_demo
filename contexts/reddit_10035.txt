New Residence Director Help
Hey Guys,

I am going into my second months of being an RD at a small school in PA. There has seemed to be a disconnect between my RAs and Residents. The Residents are seeing them as cops and not as community builders. Any advice on how to overcome this barrier between the RAs and Residents. Any help at all will be great.
