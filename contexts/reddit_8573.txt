Could a system of mandatory blind trusts for politicians be implemented in America?
With the [recent news of Chris Collins's arrest for insider trading and lying to the FBI](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/08/gop-congressman-chris-collins-to-be-indicted-on-insider-trading-charge.html), and the [continuing legal questions surrounding the emoluments clause and Trump's businesses](https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/25/politics/emoluments-case-donald-trump-washington-dc/index.html), there has been increased attention given towards the usage of blind trusts.


[Presidents Clinton and George W. Bush both used blind trusts, while President Obama used a mixture of index funds, treasury notes, and college savings accounts. While Trump's assets have been perceived as not being transferable to a blind trust due to their expansiveness, it has been suggested that a general trust could have been created to manage his businesses and significantly reduce the appearance of a conflict of interest.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jenniferwang/2016/11/15/why-trump-wont-use-a-blind-trust-and-what-his-predecessors-did-with-their-assets/#57ff157729c0)



What examples exist out there for the usage of blind trusts? 
How have other countries addressed the potential conflicts of interest that may occur when politicians hold stocks or significant interests in businesses? Could those same systems be applied in America?


Is it possible to legislate the usage of blind trusts?
