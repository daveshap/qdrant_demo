Feeling behind
I'm only 20(f), and my boyfriend is only 23, but I can't help but feel like I'm floating around like a lost kid, just following his lead. Right before covid hit he landed this great new job with great income. Now that our state is reopening, he travels weekly for work as was orginally planned when he took the offer. I miss him, but I'm realizing I'm basically his puppy. I don't have a job so he tends to support me a lot while I'm trying to find one for the summer. My friends and I lost most contact when we all went separate ways for college. I try to keep planning things with them and keep in touch, but they're a bit unresponsive, even more so now that the plague is going around. As a result I've been spending more time talking to bf friend's and gaming with them online. They're cool and I think they don't mind me hanging around, but it's kinda obvious that they tend to think of me as X's girlfriend, rather than someone they can just be a friend to. Now that he's out of town, I'm realizing how lonely I am. I don't really know how to fix it. I've tried joining public discords involving things I'm interested in, but there tend to be so many people in those that anything I say gets drowned out. I was starting to make friends at college but then everything became online and I lost touch with them. My options are limited right now and I just feel like a pathetic lost puppy dog.
