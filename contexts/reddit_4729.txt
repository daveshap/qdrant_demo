Fiancé’s depression is getting bad, not sure how to help/navigate
My fiancé has always suffered from depression but as of late he said it’s gotten worse. I’ve also taken noticed because he’s been getting especially aggressive lately. He can be hurtful and when I try to point it out to him the mean things he’s said to me that I don’t appreciate, he goes on the defensive and feels like i’m attacking him and deflects the issue. This has cause multiple arguments that have really put a strain on our relationship but I refuse to give up on him. Overall he’s become more irritable, angrier, and his mood changes quickly. How can I navigate around his anger while also have him recognize the consequences of his outbursts? 

I’m also unsure of how to help him in terms of making him feel better. Our mutual friend has told me that he confided in her that he feels unworthy of love. I try my best to make him feel loved everyday but maybe there is something I’m missing. What are some ideas your SO’s have come up with that have made you feel better or what is something you would like for yourself? or something that you yourself have done that helped you in the past that I can recommend to him?
