What can I do to further my career in higher education while my wife is in medical school?
**TLDR:** I'm currently pushing papers at a medical school with a bachelor's degree in a STEM field while my wife is in medical school. Due to her program, we will move in Summer 2021, Summer 2023, and possibly 2026 or 2027 to currently unknown locations with about 3 months notice for each. What can I do to stay/become competitive for better positions in Higher Ed/Student Affairs with such constraints?

**Context:** I have 5 years (2 as a student, 3 post-baccalaureate) of experience in student affairs. My first job was amazing, crossed most functional areas of the field, and I doubt I'll have another one like it until I hit mid-level career status. I applied and was accepted to a great Masters program, fully funded with tuition and stipend, but in a bitter twist of luck my wife got into medical school for the same term. Her turning it down or trying to defer while I finished a two-year program would have been career suicide, we can't do long-distance, and the schools are hours apart, so I turned down my acceptance and moved with her last summer. I got a full-time position in administration at the medical school she attends, and it pays the bills and keeps a full-time job that's technically in the field on my resume, but it's a significant step back from where I was - or at least feels like it. Competition for jobs here is fierce, and potential employers know that I'm a short-term (2 years) employee, so I'm glad that I got the job, but it's not what I want. Which leads me to our upcoming moves.

We will be here (with me in the same job) until next summer. Her program will require her to move, probably at least 2 hours away, for clinical rotations starting summer 2021 and I will come with her. Then, in summer 2023, she will graduate and we will move for residency (wherever she matches). Residency will probably last three or four years, after which we may move again.

My priorities are having a fulfilling job and getting a master's degree that will help me advance through the field. Reducing our debt load would be nice, but my wife's program will run our student debt burden into the hundreds of thousands, so really what's another 20k?

**Some of the options I've identified:**

1. There is a Master's program at the local university here, but the program is completely online, with no significant practical experiences, and no assistantships, tuition remission, or stipend. I could do it while keeping my job, and it would cost 10-15k. I would be in-progress by the time we move again (and I search for another job in our new location), and complete it sometime next year after the move.
2. Some of the possible locations for our next move (2021) have local universities, and some of those have a Master's program in my field. Some are online, some are hybrid, but most have better opportunities for funding an assistantships. The pay cut if I could get a stipend would be slight (4-8k difference from my current salary). I would get my Master's by 2022 or 2023, in time for our move for residency in 2023. But, we could end up somewhere without a program available.
3. I could just get a job at our 2021 location, hopefully one that's less administrative and more focused on my goals and trajectory, maybe paying a little bit more, and delay my education until we move for residency in 2023. I'm worried that I won't be competitive for non-administrative jobs without the Master's, so any insight on this would be nice (I'm in Southeastern US). We do get more of a choice for residency, but it's too early in her program to tell how competitive she will be (and thus how much choice we'll get to choose a location with a good program for me). We could end up back where we started, where my original program was (and I'm relatively certain they would take me back if I wanted to reapply for that program). This comes with the same uncertainty of if we don't wind up where we want, I'll have essentially wasted four years pushing paper only to wind up in relatively the same spot with no options for another three or four years, when I could have been getting a degree (even one from a less-great program).

Aside from a traditional degree and 9-5, I'd love ideas on other things to make me more competitive - online/virtual learning, conferences to attend, professional organizations to join, whatever's out there.
