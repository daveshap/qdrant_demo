EVELYN: Would you like something to drink?
GITTES: What are you having?
EVELYN: Iced tea.
GITTES: Yeah. Fine, thank you.
EVELYN: My husband's at the office.
GITTES: Actually he's not. And he's moved from his apartment at the El Macando.
EVELYN: That's not his apartment.
GITTES: Anyway... I... the point is, Mrs. Mulwray. I'm not in business to be loved, but I am in business, and believe me, whoever set up your husband, set me up. L.A.'s a small town, people talk.
GITTES: I'm just trying to make a living, and I don't want to become a local Joke.
EVELYN: Mr. Gittes, you've talked me into it. I'll drop the lawsuit.
GITTES: What?
EVELYN: I said I'll drop it.
EVELYN: So let's just drop the whole thing. Sugar? Lemon?
GITTES: Mrs. Mulwray?
EVELYN: Yes, Mr. Gittes?
GITTES: I don't want to drop it.
GITTES: I should talk this over with your husband.
EVELYN: Why?... What on earth for? Look, Hollis seems to think you're an innocent man.
GITTES: Well, I've been accused of many things, Mrs. Mulwray, but never that.
GITTES: You see, somebody went to a lot of trouble here, and I want to find out, lawsuit or no lawsuit. I'm not the one who's supposed to be caught with my pants down... so I'd like to see your husband. Unless that's a problem.
EVELYN: What do you mean?
GITTES: May I speak frankly, Mrs. Mulwray?
EVELYN: You may if you can, Mr. Gittes.
GITTES: Well, that little girlfriend, she was attractive in a cheap sort of way of course. She's disappeared. Maybe they disappeared together somewhere.
EVELYN: Suppose they did. How does it concern you?
GITTES: Nothing personal, Mrs. Mulwray, I just --
EVELYN: It's very personal. It couldn't be more personal. Is this a business or an obsession with you?
GITTES: Look at it this way. Now this phony broad, excuse the language, says she's you, she's hired me. Whoever put her up to it, didn't have anything against me. They were out to get your husband. Now if I see him, I can help him. Did you talk this morning?
EVELYN: No. I went riding rather early.
GITTES: Looks like you went quite a distance.
EVELYN: No, Just riding bareback, that's all. Anyway, you might try the Oak Pass or Stone Canyon Reservoirs. Sometimes at lunch Hollis takes walks around them. Otherwise he'll be home by 6:30.
GITTES: I'll stop by.
EVELYN: Please call first.
