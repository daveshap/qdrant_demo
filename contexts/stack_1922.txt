If something fell out of Mars' sky onto the Martian surface, would it have \"crashed to earth\"? In some fantasy writing I'm working with, it says \"those citadels have crashed to earth and their secrets wait to be discovered\" at some point.  However, the story's setting is not on Earth, our planet in reality.  It's also not named Earth.  Is \"crashed to earth\" correct here?I asked the writer the question in the context of something falling out of the Martian sky and crashing onto the Martian surface, as I believe that to be a direct parallel to the situation in this fantasy story.  It would seem a little unusual to me to read \"crashed to earth\" in the context of Mars, and that is how it seemed in the context of this fantasy writing.
