MONICA: What?
CAMILLE: Whenever you lose, you get this attitude. But it's just a game.
QUINCY: Can we talk?
MONICA: Talk to your new girlfriend.
QUINCY: I just took the ho to Burger King, alright.
MONICA: Cheap date.
QUINCY: Least she had time for me.
MONICA: So you fucked around to prove a point!
QUINCY: I just said I didn't fuck around. But you got your head so far up your ass it took a cheap date for you to notice me.
MONICA: What, Q-man"
QUINCY: You forgot to be there.
MONICA: That night you wanted to talk about your Dad I had a curfew. What was I supposed to do?
QUINCY: Stay!
MONICA: If I stayed, I wouldn't be starting!
QUINCY: Least you got your priorities straight.
MONICA: I never asked you to choose.
QUINCY: Never had to.
MONICA: I'm a ballplayer. If anyone knows what that means it should be you.
QUINCY: Well, if all you care about is basketball, why you fucking me? Go fuck Dick Vitale.
MONICA: How do I know next time you're feeling neglected or whatever, you're not going to run around on me? If we're going to be together I have to be able to trust you.
QUINCY: I'm not asking for us to be together.
MONICA: What?
QUINCY: I'm going through a lot of shit right now, more than you have time for.
MONICA: How are you going to tell me what I have time for? I mean, whatever I did...we can fix this.
QUINCY: I don't think so.
MONICA: You don't think so?
QUINCY: Look, I'm entering the draft.
MONICA: You're what?
QUINCY: I decided to go pro. And who knows where I'll end up, you know?
MONICA: When did you decide all this?
QUINCY: Few days ago.
MONICA: So that's it, just forget about us?
QUINCY: Damnitt, Monica. This ain't about us anymore, it's about me.
