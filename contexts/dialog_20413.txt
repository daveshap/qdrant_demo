KAREN: You really wear that suit.
FOLEY: That's not what you were about to say.
KAREN: Remember how talkative you were? In the trunk? Adele said you do that when you're nervous.
FOLEY: She did, huh.
KAREN: You kept touching me, feeling my thigh.
FOLEY: Yeah, but in a nice way.
FOLEY: I might've smelled like a sewer, but you could tell I was a gentleman. They say John Dillinger was a pretty nice guy.
KAREN: He killed a police officer.
FOLEY: I hear he didn't mean to. The cop fell as Dillinger was aiming at his leg and got him through the heart.
KAREN: You believe that?
FOLEY: Why not?
