UPHAM: Demolition, right?
WADE: Since I was nine years old. They got a lot of explosives around mines. Me and my little brother could get into any warehouse you ever saw. Damn, we had fun!
JACKSON: I'm Jackson. I'm from West Fork, Tennessee. My pappy's a preacher. Him and his two brothers got a ministry, The Blessed Church of the Wandering Gospel.
UPHAM: In West Fork?
JACKSON: In the back of a nineteen and thirty- one stretch Hudson with a big ole' trailer.
UPHAM: No kidding.
JACKSON: I don't make jokes about things of, or related to, the preaching of the Holy Gospel, including the ministerial calling of my family.
UPHAM: So they travel around from place to place and preach?
JACKSON: We got us a tent, forty-two feet across, eighteen feet at center, hundred-and-ten foldin' chairs. Circuit's eleven towns, covers all 'a Hasset County and most 'a Weller County. I expect that upon completion of my military service I will be joinin' said ministry.
UPHAM: What about the Captain? Where's he from?
