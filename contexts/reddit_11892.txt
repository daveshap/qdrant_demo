I just wanted to tell a story to you guys.
So on a throwaway, I had posted on this subreddit about some issues I was struggling with. I had first gone to family, friends, and church. At the time I had felt like I was interrupting people's days, and was just being selfish and petty. 

I have since gotten past the issues that I had originally posted. The responses that I received were just the encouragement that I needed to keep on trucking, and keep on moving forward. So to all of you responders, I wanted to say thank you. You're truly helping people. 

For those of you that are currently posting, keep posting! If it's important to you, it's important to us.
