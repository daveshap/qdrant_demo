Memory Addressing How To? I have read some about computer memory and the article said DRAM is mainly made from a transistor to direct the electricity and a capacitor to store them. I don't understand how it fills certain capacitors and leaves some open to create ones and zeros.At first I thought it was just a sequence of electrons and spaces lacking electrons, but I don't see how the next series of electrons after a space would know to skip one transistor and go to the next instead of just filling the first transistor.Then I learned there is a bit line where one means write and zero equals don't write, but how does it know where to write and not write? Why wouldn't the first transistor just process the write or not write over and over?Ok, I'm going to add an example to this. Lets say I had four transistors and capacitors. How would I make the first one a one, the second a zero, the third a one, and the fourth a zero? How does this work?
