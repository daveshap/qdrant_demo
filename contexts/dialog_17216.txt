HAWKEYE: My name's Hawkeye Pierce.
DUKE: Duke Forrest.
DUKE: You got directions?
HAWKEYE: Ayuh, only it's early, I need a drink to wake me up.
DUKE: I got some.
HAWKEYE: Make it yourself, or is it real?
DUKE: Georgia, where I come from, it's real if you make it yourself. But I been buying from the Yankee Government since they put me in this soldier suit and give me a rate.
HAWKEYE: Tax-free booze. It's about all you can say for army life.
DUKE: Where you from with that crazy way of talking?
HAWKEYE: Crabapple Cove. Maine.
DUKE: Damn! That must be about as far north as you can get.
HAWKEYE: Pretty near. What do you know about the outfit we're going to?
DUKE: C.O. is Colonel Blake. Lieutenant Colonel Henry Braymore Blake. One of them regular army clowns. Push you around so it's hard to get any decent work done.
HAWKEYE: We got to head them off, right at the start. Push them around first.
