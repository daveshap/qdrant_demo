LOMBARD: What happens now?
MARTIN: We conclude our transaction.
MARTIN: The room’s yours for 24 hours. It’s sound- proofed, stocked up with food, drink and other things you might find useful. You can do anything you like.
LOMBARD: Anything at all?
MARTIN: Anything at all. I presume you won’t want to take the boy with you when you’re finished? There’s a £500 fee for disposal. The boy is yours, you understand?
MARTIN: Vous êtes Français?
LOMBARD: Does it matter?
