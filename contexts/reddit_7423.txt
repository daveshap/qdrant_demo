Finally completed my coursework
Wow! After five semesters of juggling work and school, waking up early and sleeping late for readings, weekends and holidays writing, and my mind being all over the place, finally, I have completed my coursework.

I am just so elated at the moment, and while I know I still have few more stops with my comprehensive exam and thesis next on the line, I am really just so happy!
