How can I find out how many peer-reviewed papers are published per year on a specific scientific topic?
For my Physics PhD defense, I want to point out that my topic is a burgeoning research topic, is there a tool online to gather this information for me? For example, if I was talking about carbon nanotubes, it would plot publications per year in a specified date range, which shows the trend in research publications. I have not figured out how to google this, so I don't think it is easily googleable, and I *could* go on Web of Science and search by topic and just write it all down, but there must be a better way. Thanks! If this is the wrong sub, please help!
