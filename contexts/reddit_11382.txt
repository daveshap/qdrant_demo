$60 short. Coworker pissed at me seriously wanna kms.
I recently started a new job and I was closing. I seriously fucked up. I was $60 short and he’s pissed at me (he was opening). He told me not to come into work today and that he would cover my closing. He quickly delete the messages (I saw them pop up on my phone before they were deleted) and then he said he’d close with me today. After he said he wasn’t going to stay.  We work in this particular section of the store and he has the lead position and  my schedule and stuff. I’m so dumb I seriously hate myself. Someone wants to speak to me when I go in today. I’m a super anxious person and I’m scared to in. Hate myself so much.
