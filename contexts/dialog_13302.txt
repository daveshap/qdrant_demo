AMY: Yeah, and I'll bet his initials are Sidney J. Mussburger!
SMITTY: You've lost it, Aim. You've gone soft by the looks of it -- soft on the dummy from Dubuque --
AMY: Muncie!
CHIEF: Whatever! It's no dig on you, Archer, but this story is hot and you're no longer on top of it. Why, it's the scoop of the century -- the other papers won't have the Gunderson dope 'til tomorrow -- The Allemeinischer Zeitung, Le Figaro, they'll be choking on our dust come mornin' --
AMY: You're fools, both of you! It's obvious they're out to crucify Norville! They're trying to destroy him!
CHIEF: Amy -- take a break. You've worked hard on this story -- heck, you broke it for us! But it's passed you by and Smith here has taken up the slack.
