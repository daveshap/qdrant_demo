Lonely at 23
I'm sorry if my text is a bit confusing i'm crying right now and English is not my mother tongue and I'm too tired to learn anymore.

I have only one friend right now and if I don't text her she won't unless she needs me. I'm always like "can we talk right now ?" and I feel always pathetic, I insist again and again and I always have the same answer "Oh sorry I'm busy". I just want to talk to someone.

My brother leaves the house 1 year ago and now we don't talk to each other. That makes me sad, you know, he don't need me either. He has his friends, why would he want to spend time with his old brother ?

My cat is gone some months ago, i miss him so much. I didn't see something was wrong... I'm just stupid.

In on week I will start my new job i'm afraid not to be good enough, not to integrate in the team.

Right now I have no one to talk to maybe because I'm boring...
