HECTOR: If he's here, I'll find him. Did she tell you we had sex together?
KELLY: I never had sex with you!
HECTOR: Even so, you're allowed to boast. You look thin by the way, I've mentally undressed you, I can see your ribcage.
KEOUGH: I really don't mean to be discourteous. But how is it a person could come to believe that a crocodile is in New England?
HECTOR: They have saltwater glands, they can swim across oceans, it's only a matter of time.
KEOUGH: And what would he do come winter?
HECTOR: They can survive winter. As long as their nostrils don't freeze, they survive, am I foolish to explain things, he had such trouble with my name?
