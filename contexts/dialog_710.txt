MARSHALL: Uh, we got a problem here.
COL. CARLTON: Just stay on my wing, sir. I'll take you all the way in.
MARSHALL: No. We're losing fuel and my rudder's not responding.
COL. CARLTON: Lemme take a look.
COL. CARLTON: Aw, man. You're torn up pretty bad out here, sir. Do you have any elevater control.
MARSHALL: Sluggish... I think it's jammed too.
COL. CARLTON: Uh, Tower, we got a problem up here.
