SCHINDLER: I'll talk to him.
STERN: I think it's too late.
SCHINDLER: Well, I'll talk to somebody. I'll take care of it.
SCHINDLER: What's he done that's so bad - take money? That's a crime? Come on, what are we here for, to fight a war? We're here to make money, all of us.
TOFFEL: There's taking money and there's taking money, you know that. He's taking money.
SCHERNER: The place produces nothing. I shouldn't say that - nothing it produces reaches the Army. That's not all right.
SCHINDLER: So I'll talk to him about it.
SCHERNER: He's a friend of yours, you want to help him out. Tell me this, though - has he ever once shown you his appreciation? I've yet to see it. Never a courtesy. Never a thank you note. He forgets my wife at Christmas time -
SCHINDLER: He's got no style, we all know that. So, we should hang him for it?
TOFFEL: He's stealing from you, Oskar.
SCHINDLER: Of course he's stealing from me, we're in business together. What is this? I'm sitting here, suddenly everybody's talking like this is something bad. We take from each other, we take from the Army, everybody uses everybody, it works out, everybody's happy.
