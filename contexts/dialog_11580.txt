AL: Twenty days work, oh boy!
PA: Be glad to get my han' on some cotton. That's the kin' a pickin' I understan'.
MA: Maybe. Maybe twenny days work, maybe *no* days work. We ain't got it till we get it.
AL: Whatsa matter, Ma? Gettin' scared?
MA: No. Ain't ever gonna be scared no more. I was, though. For a while I thought we was beat--*good* an' beat. Looked like we didn't have nothin' in the worl' but enemies--wasn't *no*body frien'ly anymore. It made me feel bad an' scared too--like we was lost... an' nobody cared.
AL: Watch me pass that Chevvy.
