MALKOVICH: It's like nothing I've ever felt before. I think I'm going crazy.
KEVIN BACON: I'm sure you're not going crazy.
MALKOVICH: Kevin, I'm telling you... it was like nothing I've...
KEVIN BACON: Yeah yeah yeah. Yadda yadda yadda. Were you stoned?
MALKOVICH: Yes, but you see, someone else was talking through my mouth.
KEVIN BACON: You were stoned. Case closed. End of story. How hot is this babe?
MALKOVICH: I think it might've been this Lotte woman talking through me. Maxine likes to call me Lotte.
KEVIN BACON: Ouch. Now that's hot. She's using you to channel some dead lesbian lover. Let me know when you're done with her. This is my type of chick.
MALKOVICH: I'm done with her now. Tonight really creeped me out.
KEVIN BACON: You're crazy to let go of a chick who calls you Lotte. I tell you that as a friend.
MALKOVICH: I don't know anything about her. What if she's some sort of witch or something?
KEVIN BACON: All the better. Hey, Hot Lesbian Witches, next Geraldo, buddy boy. Ha ha ha.
MALKOVICH: I gotta know the truth, Kevin.
KEVIN BACON: The truth is for suckers, Johnny-Boy.
