So my "friend" got me an interview at her work. so we work at the same company now. It's been 7 months and yet shes so rude to me and I dont get why?
At the beginning sure maybe its frustrating cus I'm making mistakes and learning. 

But today I really had it.... she came to me and said " does this (envelope) say my name?" I said obviously not. and she just gave it to me cus I process the mail and put in whoevers folder it belongs to.  before I could have thought she left and I realized the only mail I gave to her was when she came by my desk and i handed her another piece of mail. plus the stamp I use on the mail is black and the stamp on the envelope was red. I figured it was the receptionist cus we split the mail. But i wasnt gunna bring it back up just cus its such a small thing, even tho she blew it out of proportion. I know if I had told her it was the receptionist she would joyfully say okay and prance off.

When its someone else's fault she kindly lets them know, but when its me shes condescending, undermining and rude. 

I dont get why, and I dont know how to end this childish behaviour of hers.
