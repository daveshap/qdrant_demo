Using graduate and categorize in QGIS? I'm using a .csv detailing types of renewable energy in the UK. I want to display them as different colours for the types of energy (e.g. wind, solar, gas etc.) but also a different size symbol based on the energy output.All the information is in the .csv file and I am able to perform these two styles independently, but I can't work out how to do this together.  I'm new to GIS so just getting the hang of things!
