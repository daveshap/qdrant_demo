BANISTER: All this blubbering over that sonofabitch! They're grieving like they knew the man. It makes me want to puke.
MARTIN: God's sake, chief. The President was shot.
BANISTER: A bullshit President! I don't see any weeping for all the thousands of Cubans that bastard condemned to death and torture at the Bay of Pigs. Where are all the tears for the Russians and Hungarians and Chinese living like slaves in prison camps run by Kennedy's communist buddies - All these damned peace treaties! I'm telling ya Jack, that's what happens when you let the niggers vote. They get together with the Jews and the Catholics and elect an Irish bleeding heart.
MARTIN: Chief, maybe you had a little too much to drink.
BANISTER: Bullshit! Bartender, another round... Here's to the New Frontier. Camelot in smithereens. I'll drink to that.
