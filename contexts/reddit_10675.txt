A few months ago I set a deadline. That deadline, March 12 has arrived.
When I last [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/5mmg7z/i_set_a_deadline/), life seemed completely miserable with no possibility of it getting any better. I continued living day to day, mostly miserable and feeling absolutely lifeless inside. I continued my daily activities with that fake smile so no one would suspect my plan to jump off that bridge with a rope around my neck. Then an unanticipated trip abroad to an exotic land halfway around the world popped up. Then came an out of the blue reconnecting with an old friend. Then came a tiny puppy into my life. Things aren't completely terrible at the moment. To quote Hyperbole and a Half, "Maybe everything isn't hopeless bullshit." For the moment, I want to live.
