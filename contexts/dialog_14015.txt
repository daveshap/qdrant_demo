WILL: The shower again?
JULIE: It was in a church...it was so real. I mean, I could feel his breath on me.
WILL: I'm sorry.
JULIE: I thought I was over the dreams for good. I really did. I hadn't had one for months.
WILL: It just takes time, Julie. It's gonna get better.
JULIE: It can't get worse. I mean, it's not like this was the first time I freaked out in class. I hardly ever get a full night's sleep, my grades suck, I'm this close from being thrown out of school.
JULIE: It was one year ago...
WILL: It's...the anniversary. That's what's going on...Take it easy on yourself.
JULIE: I'm trying. I really am...Sometimes I don't even know why I came up here in the first place.
WILL: To get out of Southport?
JULIE: Right. Now I remember.
WILL: Nah. I'll probably just be here studying for finals. The joys of summer school... Are you okay?
JULIE: I'm okay.
WILL: Are you sure?
