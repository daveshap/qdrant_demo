EVERETT: Two weeks! That don't do me no good!
PROPRIETOR: Nearest Ford auto man's Bristol.
EVERETT: Hold on there - I don't want this pomade, I want Dapper Dan.
PROPRIETOR: I don't carry Dapper Dan. I carry Fop.
EVERETT: No! I don't want Fop! Goddamnit - I use Dapper Dan!
PROPRIETOR: Watch your language, young fellow, this is a public market. Now, if you want Dapper Dan I can order it for you, have it in a couple of weeks.
EVERETT: Well, ain't this place a geographical oddity-two weeks from everywhere! Forget it! Just the dozen hairnets!
