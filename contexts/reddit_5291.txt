Sometimes PIP's are exactly what they say they are.
Received a PIP a month and a half ago, read comments on this sub, got scared and found a new job, put in my two weeks on Monday. My current job never intended to fire me. 

Now i feel weird leaving a company that actually intended on my performance improving. They put me on a 1 month PIP and it's been 1.5 months since then. I previously posted about receiving a PIP and everyone told me it was the end of my time here so I started looking for jobs. I found one, accepted, and put in my two weeks. Over the course of the month i continued having weekly 1on1's with my manager. She said that things were getting better but i was still making mistakes. This made me pessimistic about the future and sort of spurred my job hunt.  During my meeting with my manager they told me they weren't planning on letting me go and that it's been over a month and while I'm not where they wanted me to be, i showed improvement. 

I'm still glad i was proactive in looking for and receiving an offer, but all things considered, i enjoyed being here and my team. Now i have to start from scratch somewhere else. I know this is very anecdotal, but a PIP doesn't **ALWAYS** mean you're getting fired. I'd recommend trying to keep the line of communication as open as possible. Even though my manager wasn't going to fire me, her comments made me think otherwise.

tl;dr: Got a PIP and this sub scared me into finding a new job. Now i'm leaving a job that sincerely cared about my improvement. **PIP'S AREN'T ALWAYS THE END.**
