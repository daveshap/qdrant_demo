GM position at 19???
Hey everyone.
I'm a soon to be college grad, turning 20 soon. I've been working at this bagel bakery that I love dearly for the past year or so. I moved quickly from cashier, to line cook, to manager and then to baker. I've been given a lot of responsibility with some of the specials and stuff like that. 

Anyway my general manager is leaving soon, and she told me she'd like to train me as her replacement. This means I'd be getting a salary right out of college. 

This is a lot for me, since I went to art school for photography. I still want to pursue that, but baking is another love of mine and I feel like I can do both at once. 

Am I taking on too much? Is it bad that I have less than 5 years of restaurant experience? Or am I silly for not accepting this great chance?
