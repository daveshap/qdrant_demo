CRAIG: Hi.
LOTTE: Hi.
CRAIG: Sorry, I'm so late. Lester just wouldn't let me go. Weâ€™re supposed to have dinner with him on Friday. I can get us out of it if you want. He's really amazing, this insane old lech. It's actually sort of amusing when you get past just how disgusting it is.
LOTTE: Did you eat?
CRAIG: Nah. I'm not hungry. I'm sorry I didn't call. It was just, you know, hard to get away.
LOTTE: I was worried.
CRAIG: I'm sorry. How was your evening?
LOTTE: Tom-Tom's puncture wound is infected.
CRAIG: The ferret?
LOTTE: The iguana.
CRAIG: Right.
LOTTE: I dressed the wound. Then I've just been feeding everyone, putting everyone to bed.
CRAIG: Yeah. You want a beer?
LOTTE: No thanks. I'm going to turn in.
CRAIG: All right. I'll be in my workshop for a little while. I'll be in in a little while. I need to unwind a little. I'll be in soon. A little while.
LOTTE: 'kay.
