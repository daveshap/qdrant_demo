Whats a marketable skill that I can acquire in 2-3 months that can help me switch careers and work remotely?
Hello all,

 I just recently left a decent paying job with long hours and a shitty boss. I am hoping to take the next 2-3 months to learn a completely new skill which can help me land a job that can allow me to work from home or remotely. I have no idea where to start.

Does anyone know someone that successfully did something similar?

I have 7 years professional experience in HR and a B.S degree inBusiness/Human Resources from a State University.


BTW, I'm in Southern California.

Thanks.
