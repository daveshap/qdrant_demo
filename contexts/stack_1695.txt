How can I have different circuits relays based on a particular voltage input? I want to build a circuit that is dependent on an input from a thermistor which is in a circuit that is a voltage divider.Now if the thermistor is showing low temperature, then I want to increase my temperature supply voltage thus providing more temperature! But if the resistance of the thermistor is close to the correct value, I want to decrease the temperature supply or stop it!Maybe nested relays but that does not really work, nested Schmitt trigger will only be more accurate but does not really deliver what I am looking for, maybe a certain OpAmp configuration but how?
