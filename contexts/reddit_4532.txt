Whenever I have a day off, I realize how depressed I am
I got lucky enough to get a part time job after college and not working for two years.
I do have some side hustle jobs but it's only enough to pay my bills.
I have two friends, but both are poor artist types like myself.
I'm stuck at my parents house and I'm pushing 40. (Went to college late)
What can I do to stay afloat mentally?

Thanks
