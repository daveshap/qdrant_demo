Protecting payment mobile app against mobile theft Currently I'm designing a payment app.It has the standard security controls such as HTTPS communication, certificate pinning, no cache, login with 2FA (OTP), 2FA for payment operation.. but I'm not sure how to protect the user against a mobile theft.A thief can reset the password due to the fact that the user usually signed in to the email app, biometric authentication can be easily bypassed due to compatibility and UX requirements, secret questions are usually easy to guess.Are there any other measures that can be done in order to eliminate damage from mobile theft?
