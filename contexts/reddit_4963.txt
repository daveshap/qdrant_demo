I feel like my mental health is deteriorating constantly being someone’s emotional support, I don’t know what to do.
I have a friend who regularly comes to me for emotional support. She’s my friend, so of course I do my best to be there for her and listen to her problems but at the same time, it’s becoming a toxic situation because I’ve been feeling pretty down myself, and it’s been taking a toll on my emotional well-being. I honestly don’t mean to sound selfish at all, I really want to help her but I feel like it’s too much for me to handle.

It’s a tough situation because I feel like I’m not fit to be her emotional support as I’m going through things myself and I haven’t been feeling great for a while but I don’t think I can tell her that, I know she’s going through a lot.
Sometimes I have a meltdown because I feel so much pressure and stress, i don’t know how to reply to her, I don’t know how to handle it. 
Feels like we don’t talk about anything else other than her problems, and I really want to help but it’s so hard.

I know she relies on me for support a lot.

It’s been a few years since this has been happening. She’s always coming to me, and I’m pretty sure only me and I feel like a sponge just absorbing all her sadness. 

I don’t want her to feel like she’s a burden to me, though I can’t help feeling this way.

Has anyone been in this sort of situation ? What can I do? 

Thanks for reading.
