They'll let you be homeless but tell you suicide is "never the answer"..
Honestly, this is one of the most puzzling things about society. People tell you that "we don't live in a vaccum. everyone has people who care" along with other shamings of suicide calling you "cowardly".

But when you want to live...oh no. You're entitled to nothing. If you don't do well in school your parents kick you out and you end up homeless liviing on a cardboard box. 

But remember, don't kill yourself because "people care about you so much"

I understand having to work to participate in society but I find it so stupid that people can't see the incongruity. I can't honestly imagine telling a homeless person freezing in the cold "keep struggling because life is worth it". If they want to die, then let them die and vice versa.
