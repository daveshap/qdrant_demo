DENNIS: You with the cops?
TALLEY: The Bristo Police Department. Look out the window. You see the car?
DENNIS: Yeah. I'm Rooney.
TALLEY: We had an awful lot of shooting. You need a doctor in there?
DENNIS: We're cool.
TALLEY: Let me speak to Mr. Smith. I want to hear it from him.
DENNIS: Fuck you. I'm running this shit. You talk to me.
TALLEY: How about your two friends? You don't have a man dying in there, do you?
DENNIS: They're fine.
TALLEY: All three subjects are confirmed inside. Call off the house-to-house. Okay, Dennis, I want to explain your situation --
DENNIS: You don't have to explain shit! That Chinaman pulled a gun. We wrestled for it. That Chinaman shot himself.
TALLEY: Mr. Kim didn't make it, Dennis. He died.
DENNIS: How about the cop?
TALLEY: Dennis? I want you to release those people.
DENNIS: Fuck that. They're the only thing stopping you from blowing us away.
TALLEY: We're not coming in there by force, okay? No one wants to hurt you.
DENNIS: I got these people! You try to come get me, I'll kill every fuckin' one of them!
