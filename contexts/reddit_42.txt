How to motivate my overweight teen towards healthier lifestyle?
My (44 M) teenage son (15 M) is overweight (209 lbs, 5' 9"), he is smart, good at academics, reads a lot, plays video competitive games. He is. Great swimmer and used to swim a lot pre teen. However, now he is not very physically active. 

I and my wife are physically very active and have a healthy diet and gym routine. His diet is not too bad. Generally what we have is what he has. I have spoken to him several times about overweight problems and also  spent time with him in the gym by taking him along. He seems to be not convinced about he being overweight. 

The concern and back and forth on actions for weight loss has been going on for sometime now and I am worried now. Can someone advise how do I systematically approach and help him to maintain a healthy lifestyle?
