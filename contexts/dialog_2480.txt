JENNIFER: Boy, took you all of thirty seconds to blow that.
BRIAN: C'mon Jennifer, he's just another North-Side jag-off with a mouth.
JENNIFER: Brian, do you always have to be so stupid? Think about your future for once.
BRIAN: So now you suddenly care about my future?
JENNIFER: Look, I didn't mean to take a piece out of you back there, I just thought you'd call when you came back. You didn't and... Don't blow it just because of this garbage between us.
BRIAN: Hey, sorry if I made you look bad in front of your boss. But I'm not gonna be a poster boy for him, I'm trying to do something here. There's five hundred smoke eaters in this room that do that stuff for real every day. Tell Swayzak to talk to one of them.
