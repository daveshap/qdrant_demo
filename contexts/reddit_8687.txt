Does Trump's Order for Revoking Military Medals Apply Retroactively?
Probably not the best phrasing in the title, but in general aren't awards like these issued at the end of tours or special assignments [(Navy Awards Manual)](https://www.marines.mil/Portals/1/Publications/SecNavInst%201650.1H.pdf). 

From this article [(NPR)](https://www.npr.org/2019/08/01/747144221/navy-rescinds-awards-to-prosecutors-in-case-of-seal-acquitted-of-murdering-capti) it's not clear what awards are being wiped out. It seems like Trump is wiping out every award throughout their service? Or is it referring to some specific award that was related to the prosecution of the Navy SEAL in the article?
