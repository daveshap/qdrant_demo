STEW: What do you want?
BINGY: Oh, nothing. I just blew over - I wanted to see how the old newshound looked made up for a gentleman.
STEW: Would you like to have me turn around for you, Bingy?
BINGY: Oh boy, I'd love it.
STEW: How's that?
BINGY: Not bad - not good - but not bad. You ought to be able to fool about almost anybody.
STEW: Is that so? Well, have you seen enough - or would you like a photograph?
BINGY: A photograph? What's the matter? Hasn't mama had you done in oils yet? Just A Gigolo . . . ""
STEW: Now get this mug. You've got the kind of chin I just love to touch. And if you don't get out of here, I'm going to hang one right on it.
