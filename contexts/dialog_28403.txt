POLK: You want a drink or something?
HOOKER: No.
POLK: We want to talk to ya about Henry Gondorff.
HOOKER: Don't think I know him.
POLK: Well give yourself a couple seconds, crumb. You wouldn't wanna lie to me. Lt. Snyder here says you done a lotta griftin' in this town.
HOOKER: Lt. Snyder doesn't know shit.
HOOKER: You got nothin' on me.
POLK: We'll get it, and if we can't, we'll just make it up. Grand larceny, extortion. Counterfeiting, anything you want.
POLK: Look, I got nothin' against you, but you're in trouble here. All you gotta do is tell us when Gondorff's gonna play his chump. We come in at the sting, make the pinch, and you walk out free as a bird. No questions, no court appearance, nothing.
HOOKER: No.
POLK: You've already done time twice, and judges don't like three time losers. You wanna sit in the can for forty years, startin' tonight?
HOOKER: I'll make parole.
POLK: Like hell. You won't even get a review till you're seventy. And if the board starts to go soft, we'll let ya out in the yard some night with a hard-nose young bull who'll put fifty slugs in your face and ask what you were doin' there later.
