How to unsaddle my horse in Red Dead Redemption 2? I am at the beginning of the game shortly after the harsh winter tutorial, when the gang sets up a new camp.I was roaming around and by accident I found a nice horse that I now want to make my default one as it currently is only a temporary one.It says in the help that I should have an option to unsaddle my horse and be able to put the saddle on another one to make it my primary. Yet I see nothing like this. Is this tied to a mission I have to finish first?
