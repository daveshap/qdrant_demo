Advice for holding yourself accountable? I want to change but I'm not sure how to go about it.
I've technically already posted this but I figured I'd try and ask once more.

What are some ways you held yourself accountable in regards to cleaning and self care and stuff like that? When I was really at my low I got to the point where all I would do was sleep so I didn't have to feel anything. I want/need to get out of that and back to the person who could actually get up and do things. It's not like I don't want to do them but I let the place get so bad it's so overwhelming to think about where to start and I just freeze. I'm pregnant so I've finally starting going to therapy because I want to be healthy not only for me now but for my future child. Me and my boyfriend are trying to move to be in a less stressful place but with the emotional ups and downs and pregnancy symptoms I've been totally useless. I want to contribute and not just sleep. I need to break these habits and become a better person.
