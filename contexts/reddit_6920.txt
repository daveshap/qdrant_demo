Should I call out my managers during a group meeting?
So I'm back at my old job that I had for 2 years and came back after 2 years. I'm only here until I hear back from my uncle which will take a couple or months. I've been here for about a month now and they laid off/ fired 5 of them since I came back. It's a retail (non profit) job and we only have 10 people working the store (as of now)  All my coworkers are freaking out that they will be the next to go. 

I'm thinking calling them out in the group meeting next week. I might say this "I don't feel comfortable working here if you're going to let someone go everyweek...etc"
This place is a shithole and people are afraid to speak out. I'm not  trying to vent I just need a 3rd party on this. 
Sorry for lack of spelling or grammar I'm on mobile and its 3 AM. Thanks
