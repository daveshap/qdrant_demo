MUNRO: I'll have none of that! Montcalm is a soldier and a gentleman. Not a butcher.
HAWKEYE: Easy for you to suppose. While it is their women and children, not yours, alone in their farms!
MUNRO: You forget yourself!
JACK: We are not forgettin' Webb's promise!
MUNRO: British promises are honored. And the militia will not be released. Because I need more definite proof than this man's word!
JACK: Nathaniel's word been good on the frontier a long time before you got here!
MUNRO: This interview's over! The militia stays!
JACK: Does the rule of English law no longer govern? Has it been replaced by absolutism?
HAWKEYE: And if English law cannot be trusted, maybe these people would do better makin' a peace with the French!
HEYWARD: That is sedition! Treason!
HAWKEYE: That is the truth!
HEYWARD: I ought to have you whipped from this fort!
HAWKEYE: Major! Some day I think you and I are gonna have a serious disagreement.
