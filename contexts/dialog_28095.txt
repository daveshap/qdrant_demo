LOMBARD: What about you, Mrs De Moraes?
DEBORAH: I have too much money to work, Mr Lombard.
LOMBARD: Is that why your brother braved coming here to ask you for a loan?
DEBORAH: Perhaps it wasn’t so brave of him. Had I been here I just might have given him his money, Mr Lombard. One can reap rewards from the strangest of conduct, as someone in your line of work ought to know.
LOMBARD: Was it cash, Mr De Moraes? The £1,000. You gave it to him in cash?
