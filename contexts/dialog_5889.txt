RAINMAKER: No problem with me on the Job.
GITTES: Yeah. Do you have any references?
RAINMAKER: City of La Habra Heights filled an 800,000 gallon reservoir with sixteen inches of rain in two days.
GITTES: That's swell. But how about here? Ever worked for Robert Knox, Emma Dill, Clarence Speer, Marian Parsons, or Jasper Lamar Crabb?
RAINMAKER: Never heard of 'em... new owners?
GITTES: Yeah.
RAINMAKER: Lot of turnover these days. Better tell them to get in touch with me if they want to hang onto their land.
GITTES: Yeah, I'll do that.
