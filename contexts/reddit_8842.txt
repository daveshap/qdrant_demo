What was the motivation for HIPAA? What challenges did legislators face and overcome when passing it?
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, passed in '96, is one of the most sweeping, wide-ranging pieces of legislation impacting health care we have here in the United States. It's been described as one of the "most important healthcare changes over the past couple of decades" ([source](http://library.ahima.org/doc?oid=106325)), which is especially remarkable given that, as some law professors point out, the US is a "nation that [has] often considered, and always rejected, federal legislation to reform its system—or more accurately systems—for providing health care coverage and delivery" ([source](https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=823120105064101072011106096071029109052085065093048051024027066074117109066098001028020016099038123036046072000080076082068082025090034086038099119084095002067081034091085007099106121017069095116106011113066096107096124072069065008112070124122085&EXT=pdf)).

Thus begs the question: what was different about HIPAA? What separated HIPAA from all the other health care policy initiatives that have failed?
