TRACY: I got all my signatures. One hundred and fifty-eight -- way more than I need!
JIM: Hey, that's super
TRACY: Here they are.
JIM: You can put those in my box. I'll look at them tomorrow.

JIM: Right
JIM: Looks good to me.
TRACY: Aren't you supposed to keep them?
JIM: NO, that's fine
TRACY: I thought you were supposed to keep them.
JIM: Okay, fine. Sure
TRACY: Thanks for everything.
JIM: You bet.
TRACY: I can't wait to start campaigning.
JIM: Should be easy. So far no competition.
TRACY: Hell, you know, Coca-Cola's the world's number one soft drink, but they spend more money than anybody on advertising. I guess that's how come they stay number one.
JIM: Yeah. Okay. well, good luck Tracy
TRACY: You know, Mr. M., when I win the presidency, that means you and I are going to be spending a lot of time together next year. And I for one would like that time to be harmonious and productive. Wouldn't you?
JIM: Sure
TRACY: Okay. That's good. I just wanted to make sure.
JIM: Good luck, Tracy.
