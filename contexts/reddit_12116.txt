got yelled at by some dude during Halloween
I don't know if that was an act or not, but about several years ago on Halloween, I was walking alone down the street, trying to get some candies, when I was walking past this house nearby, and what seemed like the owner of the house, came out right to me, speed walking, and yelled out loud: "KEEP FUCKING WALKING", while pointing his hand to the direction I'm walking towards as if directing me to keep going, that scared me but I kept my composure and walked only a bit faster, then he quickly walked back to his house. After that night, I started wondering what I did to triggered his reaction, I don't understand why he did that to me? I was pretty young too, so that made me feel negatively towards Halloween.
