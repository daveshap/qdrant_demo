HARDING: It's as simple as that. You've been on our ward six hours and have already simplified the work of Freud, Jung and Maxwell Jones in one grand analogy: it's a pecking party.
MCMURPHY: I'm not talking about Fred Yoong or Maxwell Jones, buddy, what I'm talkin' about is that crummy meeting and what that nurse did to you!
HARDING: Did to me?
MCMURPHY: Did to you and all the rest of you guys.
BILLY: Y-y-yes! Yes! Y-y-y-you s-s-saw wh wh-what she c-c-can do to us!
MCMURPHY: What did I see 'cept a grown man gettin' whipped so bad he can't laugh anymore.
FREDRICKSON: It's the questions she asks.
MCMURPHY: Tell 'er to go straight to hell!
HARDING: Miss Ratched is a competent psychiatric nurse, not some, some kind of monster pecking out our eyes!
MCMURPHY: She ain't peckin' at your eyes, buddy.
