a comprehensive masterdoc of all the information needed to endure the college application process
# [the masterdoc in question](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fn2u2CRnuLwAsKvfyptC9WjlkdT7U5auT4I7444XwaI/edit?usp=sharing): it is nearly 100 pages long + has over 10 pages of links and resources!!!!

i started this beast on may 30 thinking it would just be a short guide for rising seniors @ my school who needed help with the app process. but idk dude, i was stuck at home and had a lot to say about this particular topic, so it kind of just burgeoned into smth insane.

it took me an entire month to do all the research & find all the necessary information. i genuinely don't know what i'm going to do now that it's finished but!!! it's out there now for u to use!!!! hopefully it's helpful :'\^)

here's the table of contents as a \~sneak peek\~

>Q&A / crash course / other paths outside of t20 universities / admissions journey timeline / ur application as a living, breathing human / building ur college list / dissecting ur application / writing the personal statement / writing the supplements / writing the loci / after submitting ur app / fin: onto the rest of ur life / my final half-assed worked cited

anyway, i'm not sure how many ppl will see this, but the rising seniors @ my school are pretty happy lmao.

here's the link again, just in case: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fn2u2CRnuLwAsKvfyptC9WjlkdT7U5auT4I7444XwaI/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fn2u2CRnuLwAsKvfyptC9WjlkdT7U5auT4I7444XwaI/edit?usp=sharing)
