Dodged the Generational Poverty Trap Today
I'm a big student of generational poverty behaviors in my own quest to educate  myself to be more sustainable, but also to share with the low-income people I work with.

So today my sister texts me and says she needs $400 to pay her power bill.

I look at my bank account in my usual knee jerk reaction to her crises and I just paid for my car registration and it had tanked me to just having my rent and bills in the account for the end of the month with only 1/2 a paycheck coming from my new job and I have no idea how much it will be after taxes.  I also have money I can't withdraw in my savings w/o a penalty (which I should've never told ANYONE in my family about.)

I think and think because I don't want her kids to go without power since she is so behind.  So I offer to pay her bill on a credit card I basically have thrown in a box in the back of the garage for emergencies only if she promises to pay me back by the end of Sept.

She says "oh, no..I'll just get a payday loan!"

So I am "No, that is terrible, let me pay for it! The payday loan people will take 25% of your check at least! Just give me the info and I'll go online and pay.."

"Its ok...I'll call you if it doesn't work out."

So...

**She really didn't have a bill to pay - she just wanted me to hand her a stack of cash and let her "pay" it.**

I hope other people can sympathize.  I fall prey to my family wanting money pretty easily, but an old mentor told me once, which I should've remembered, "always pay the bill, never hand over the cash."

He said he learned this because he used to do it and he'd see his sister or cousin walking around with a new Coach purse or a new TV.  And that is the epitome of generational poverty thinking - soothe the pain and lack of resources by impulse buys and entertainment, vs saving up and using windfalls to take care of things like utilities, doctors, dentists, and so forth.

Because family thinks you owe them..and maybe in some ways we do - but I can't subsidize her knowing she's not going to use it help her kids.

*\[Update\] I love to see people talking about this and sharing our experiences.  The worst think about having a trauma in our lives is the feeling we have to hide it or the people in our lives just won't understand.  When I work with new groups of teens this is the most powerful activity we do - to share our collective experiences and realize we aren't alone.*

*So my big "confession" here is that up until I was about 28, I used to panic and ask family members for money.  I'm not saying all the time, but I certainly didn't have a credit card (because my mother told me they were evil) so I didn't have credit.  I lived off my social abilities and whatever I needed, from housing to food I got from real people.*

*Earlier in my 20s, I would steal or take things just "laying around" because I "needed" them and people weren't using them so it was a waste.  I lied whenever anyone confronted me.*   
 *I lied a lot because I didn't think who I was was interesting enough and when it was discovered I either exaggerated or I had "borrowed" something.  And I took advantage of every low-income program I could (as I was taught.)  It got me through college, I have considerable loans I am working on public forgiveness for, and I was able to survive.   And for awhile, as low-income students do, I was on food stamps. I also dumpster dived a good deal and went to the Food Bank for food once a month.  Then I cut out the middle-man and opened a food bank at my college.*

*BUT when I finished my MA I impulsively moved in with my ex and we ran off to Vancouver, CA - I had a breaking point.  I am not sure what did it (it might've been I found out the 5k I sent to pay back my Mom for a car repair was pocketed by my Dad. For three years she was mad I didn't pay her back!!! I'm still angry as hell at him.)*

*I realized when I had been begging my parents for money since we couldn't cover the bills and suddenly I was like NO MORE.  NO MORE asking for money! I AM AN ADULT! I WILL TAKE CARE OF THIS!!!!!! So since that day I've never asked my parent, a friend, or anyone for money and I've prospered to some degree.  Even when I had to live on two cans of ravioli and a pack of Dollar General cookies - I kept it together, paid my bills, went to work, and pushed hard to work my way up the ladder. I still have problems - but I've been pushing myself to act like a middle-class person and be more aggressive about my self-interest and my rights.  I was taught to be passive, slip behind the scenes, and fade into the background; when I really was a performer and a fighter.*
