Easy Grad schools to get into?
My girlfriend is applying to grad schools for student affairs. My worry is she's not good enough to get in. 

3.0 undergrad GPA in integrated marketing and communications. She has experience in undergrad student programs that organize live events on campus and has worked in marketing for three years. 143ish GRE scores on the two sections.

Any schools that are easier to get into but still decent prestige-wise?

Thanks.
