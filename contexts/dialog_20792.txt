ANDREW: What have you prayed for?
JOE: For a healthy baby. For Lisa to make it through the delivery. For the Phillies to get into the playoffs.
ANDREW: There's a possibility I won't be around for the end of this trial.
JOE: I've considered that.
ANDREW: What happens?

JOE: Opera?
ANDREW: Want to hear my favorite aria?
JOE: Opera?
