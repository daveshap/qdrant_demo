Experience in public speaking, research, writing - but not with an employer and not part of my education. How can I use those skills to get an interview?
**My education & background**

I graduated with a bachelor of arts in history in 2012. I wanted to become a historian but I only had a 3.0 GPA and couldn't afford to go to grad school. I made the mistake of working too many part-time jobs to get through school that I did not network or setup connections upon graduation. 

**My skills: public speaking and publishing**

I ended up working mostly in foodservice for five years. During that time I used my free time and my history skills and started becoming a published author, editor, and researcher in academic journals, popular magazines (I even had a column), and was credited in helping write almost a dozen books that are featured on the shelves of B&N and BAM.

The publishing led to speaking engagements and presentations. Genealogy groups, non-profits, churches, fundraisers, and various history (international) clubs invited and paid me to speak. Many were only a few dozen people, but a few were in front of hundreds of people.

**TL;DR: I want to turn my $36,000 office job into a $62,000 career using my skills**

1. Do you have any recommendations on how I can funnel those skill sets into an interview opportunity? They were really impressive in foodservice interviews but likely didn't help me.
2. Are there specific jobs/careers that would use those skill sets that are not typically thought of?
3. Am I being realistic? Are these actually valuable or a waste of space on a resume?
