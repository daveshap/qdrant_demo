CONNELL: Hurry up, Pop.
ANN: Oh.
CONNELL: Right here. Sit down.
JOHN: Huh?
ANN: Are you all right?
JOHN: Yeah, I'm all right.
ANN: How many is that, six? Pretty hungry, weren't you?
COLONEL: Say, all this John Doe business is batty, if yuh ask me.
ANN: Well, nobody asked yuh.
COLONEL: Trying to improve the world by jumping off buildings. You couldn't improve the world if the building jumped on you!
JOHN: Don't mind the Colonel. He hates people.
ANN: He likes you well enough to stick around.
JOHN: Oh, that's 'cause we both play doohickies. I met him in a box car a couple o' years ago. I was foolin' around with my harmonica and he comes over and joins in. I haven't been able to shake him since.
CONNELL: All right, boys, here he is.
ANN: No, no, no! You can't take pictures of him like that—eating a sandwich—and with a beard!
CONNELL: But, he's gonna jump off a building!
ANN: Yes, but not because he's out of a job. That's not news! This man's going to jump as a matter of principle.
CONNELL: Well, maybe you're right.
ANN: We'll clean him up and put him in a hotel room—under bodyguards. We'll make a mystery out of him. Did you speak to Mr. Norton?
CONNELL: Thinks it's terrific. Says for us to go the limit. Wants us to build a bonfire under every big shot in the state.
ANN: Oh, swell! Is that the contract?
CONNELL: Yes. What's he doing here?
ANN: Friend of his. They play duets together.
CONNELL: Duets? But can we trust him?
ANN: Oh!
JOHN: I trust him.
CONNELL: Oh, you trust him, eh? Well, that's fine. I suppose he trusts you, too?
ANN: Oh, stop worrying. He's all right.
COLONEL: That's—
CONNELL: Well, okay. But we don't want more than a couple o' hundred people in on this thing. Now the first thing I want is an exact copy of the John Doe letter in your own handwriting.
ANN: I got it all ready. Here.
CONNELL: Well, that's fine. Now I want you to sign this agreement. It gives us an exclusive story under your name day by day from now until Christmas. On December twenty-sixth, you get one railroad ticket out of town, and the Bulletin agrees to pay to have your arm fixed. That's what you want, isn't it?
JOHN: Yeah, but it's got to be by Bone- Setter Brown.
CONNELL: Okay, Bone-Setter Brown goes. Here, sign it. Meanwhile, here's fifty dollars for spending money. That's fine. Beany!
BEANY: Yeah, Boss?
CONNELL: Take charge of him. Get him a suite at the Imperial and hire some bodyguards.
