MOE: Hell, he was banging cocktail waitresses two at a time. Players couldn't get a drink.
MICHAEL: I have to go back to New York tomorrow. Think of your price.
MOE: You son of a bitch, you think you can brush me off like that? I made my bones when you were going out with cheerleaders.
FREDO: Tom, you're the Consigliere; you can talk to the Don and advise him.
MICHAEL: The Don has semi-retired. I'm running the Family business now. So anything you have to say, say it to me.
