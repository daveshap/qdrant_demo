NORVILLE: ...Why, this is worthless.
BUZZ: Huh?! But, buddy --
NORVILLE: This is the most idiotic thing I've ever seen in my life!
BUZZ: Yeah, but, buddy --
NORVILLE: Nobody wants a hare-brained product like this! Ya see, Buzz, it lacks the creative spark, the unalloyed genius that made, uh...
NORVILLE: ...say, the hula hoop such a success.
BUZZ: But, buddy --
NORVILLE: And what do you mean barging in here and taking up my valuable time! I've got a company to run here --
BUZZ: But, buddy, you were --

BUZZ: Geez, I'm sorry, buddy --
NORVILLE: An example must be made!
BUZZ: Wuddya mean, buddy?
NORVILLE: Fired! You're fired! Is that plain enough for you, buster!
BUZZ: Awwww, buddy --
NORVILLE: And don't call me buddy! Out of here! Out!
BUZZ: Aw, please, sir -- this job, it's all I got!
NORVILLE: Get up!
BUZZ: I understand if ya don't like the Buzz-Sucker! Just lemme keep my job, I'm prayin' to ya!

BUZZ: I'm sorry, buddy... I'm sorry...
NORVILLE: Buzz... off! Ha-ha-ha-ha!

MUSSBURGER: Sure, sure, it's a tough course. Well thanks for coming, kid. I thought the board room would be a swell place to chat undisturbed -- it seems we're having some security problems here at the Hud.
NORVILLE: Ya don't say.
MUSSBURGER: Mm. Ordinarily I wouldn't bother you with it, but -- this is embarrassing, kid -- it seems to concern you directly.
NORVILLE: How's that, Sid?
MUSSBURGER: It's not important in itself -- some elevator boy you fired came to me claiming you'd stolen the idea for the, uh, the hoop dingus from him --
NORVILLE: Huh?! He -- no, I -- he's just -- maybe I was a little rough on the boy, ya see I --
MUSSBURGER: Ah forget it, kid, ya don't have to explain to me. He's a little person. He's nothing. Like I say, ordinarily it would just be a nuisance. But it seems -- well, there was a spy in the company...
