LESTAT: Oh, Claudia, you've outdone yourself. Where did you find them?
CLAUDIA: Drunk on brandy wine. A thimblefull. I thought of you when I saw them.

LESTAT: Absinthe? You gave then absinthe?
CLAUDIA: No. Laudanum.
LESTAT: Laudanum!
CLAUDIA: Yes. It killed them, unfortunately. But it keeps the blood warm.
