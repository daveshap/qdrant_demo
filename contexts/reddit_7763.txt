Any other confused NDSEG fellows out there?
I was awarded with an NDSEG in April, and I’ve been fairly disappointed with how STI-Tech was managing the awards. I’m in the process of transferring schools, and I’m not even sure if my tuition payment will be sent to the correct school, as the fall semester is right around the corner.

Then today, they sent out an email explaining that STI-Tech is now no longer managing NDSEG fellows, but another company (Systems Plus, INC) is in charge. I sent an email their way, but have yet to hear from them. Like I said, the semester starts in under a month and the timing couldn’t be worse for me.

Are there any NDSEG veterans that know what’s going on here, or at least can provide some helpful advice?
