Job for quiet person who wants to work their way up the ranks?
I'm currently the assistant editor of a small but influential publication in my field of study. It's a small team (3 of us) so there's really no room for upward mobility at this organization; plus, I'm feeling ready to move on, anyway. Most of the job postings I'm interested in are communications/writing/project management/managing editor-type roles. 

The problem is, I'm a rather quiet, introverted person (but not shy). I tend to need a good bit of time and space to think things through and strategize. I enjoy talking to people one-on-one. I can do presentations and structured discussions well. But drop me in a group dinner where everyone is casually conversing and I get stuck in my head thinking about everything that everyone is saying and before long just want to go back to my hotel room and knit. However, I'm apparently pretty good at projecting confidence. On a recent work trip, my supervisor (who I don't work closely with at all) told me, "You don't really strike me as the type of person who gets stressed out about things." Which I found surprising and hilarious because that's pretty far from the truth.

Most of the jobs I'm interested in that have room to grow and reach higher, managerial roles require a lot of people skills. And I'm just kind of...awkward.

So my question is two-fold: are people-oriented, higher-powered jobs harder for quiet people, and if so, *what are some good alternative career paths* in the publishing industry or in communications for people like me who like people, and can play the part well, but who generally prefer to work with plenty of time to think and process independently? Also, are management roles harder to get if you're quiet?
