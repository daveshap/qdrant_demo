Anyone ever have a manager that never accepts blame?
My manager keeps getting complaints from customers that call head office in regards to him telling them false information/going back on his word. He told a customer to meet him on wed which was his day off and the customer got mad at me and told me to tell my manager he sucks. That customer called head office and complained about my manager. We get into work tgis morning and he starys yelling at us saying its our fault we are telling the customer false information and that if we dont know whats going on to shut up.

I assume he told head office this as well since he doesnt like taking blame. He constantly throws us under the bus to other managers and even customers so they dont get mad at him. Not sure where to go at this point. I have called our regional manager in the past and she chewed him out but nothing happened and it has just made my life hell having to deal with him now. Is it worth going to the higher ups again? This company is incredible and i love my job its just he is the worst manager i have ever had.
