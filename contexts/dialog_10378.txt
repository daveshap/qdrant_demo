BOURKE-WHITE: But do you really believe you could use non-violence against someone like Hitler?
GANDHI: Not without defeats -- and great pain. But are there no defeats in this war -- no pain? What you cannot do is accept injustice. From Hitler -- or anyone. You must make the injustice visible -- be prepared to die like a soldier to do so.
BOURKE-WHITE: Is my finger supposed to be wrapped around that?
GANDHI: No. That is what you get for distracting me.
BOURKE-WHITE: What do you expect when you talk like that?
GANDHI: I expect you to show as much patience as I am now.
