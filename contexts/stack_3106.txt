Why is the net flux in a cube surface area zero when the source charge is located outside? Can some one please explain why a charge located outside a box shaped surface area produces zero net flux? I know this question has been asked many times, but I can't seem to find one that answers my problem with it.I cannot seem to make sense of this because if the electric field decreases in magnitude with increasing distance from the source, won't the electric field lines leaving the surface have less magnitude than the ones entering it since it is farther from the source due to the surface area having a certain width, which leads to a greater flux inwards than outwards? Thanks\ufeff in advance.
