Yesterday I had a panic attack at the dentist.
Yesterday I wasn’t doing so well. I’m switching anxiety medications, so I’m going through a bit of withdrawal which isn’t fun. I thought about cancelling my dental appointment, but decided to go anyway. One of the nurses heard me state that I was having a bit of a panic attack, and I might need to do the x-rays another time. She took me back to the X-Ray room, and instead of prepping me for it, she told me that she had anxiety also, and she was willing to let me sit for a while to calm down. We talked for a while, and she told me I was very strong. She told me that she knows the struggles of anxiety as well, and they are very real. She actually started crying a bit, and I asked if I could hug her, which she accepted. 

After my appointment, I sat in my car for a while just thinking. I called my mom to tell her about it, and she started crying too. It’s nice to know I’m never alone.
