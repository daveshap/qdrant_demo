What are the legal implications of the Trump administration's new change to the DoJ definition of sexual assault?
Under [the old definition](https://web.archive.org/web/20180405013124/https://www.justice.gov/ovw/sexual-assault), 

> Sexual assault is any type of sexual contact or behavior that occurs without the explicit consent of the recipient. Falling under the definition of sexual assault are sexual activities as forced sexual intercourse, forcible sodomy, child molestation, incest, fondling, and attempted rape.

Under the [new definition](https://www.justice.gov/ovw/sexual-assault):

> The term “sexual assault” means any nonconsensual sexual act proscribed by Federal, tribal, or State law, including when the victim lacks capacity to consent.

Most state laws were less stringent than the old definition of sexual assault. For example, [here](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/compare.cfm)'s a comparison of the legal definition of consent in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Montana. 

According to [RAINN's database](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/), only 8 states require "affirmative or freely given consent." Those states are Florida, Wisconsin, New Hampshire, Minnesota, Washington, New Jersey, Illinois, and California. 

What are the legal implications of the change in wording?
