I was bullied out of this field.
I love SA, I love my students.

Increasingly, I've found myself at odds with the increasingly passionate environment that politics tended to generate. 

That said, I was called an idiot and a Trump supporter today because I wanted full context to a racial accusation. This requested for context so I could verify the incident left me labeled as a traitor and ignoramus. 

I announced my intention to leave the field recently and was told this field wasn't for me, and that I should apply at the white house. 

People are bullies.
