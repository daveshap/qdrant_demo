HILDY: Same way you did. Through that gate.
HARTMAN: I gave strict orders that nobody was to interview Williams without my permission.
HILDY: All right, then, I'll just run the story that Sheriff Hartman is afraid to let reporters interview his prisoner. Of course, with election coming, that might do you a lot of harm, but just as you say.
HARTMAN: Now, wait a minute! I'm not afraid of anything. What were you going to write about Williams?
HILDY: Oh, nothing much. Just that the state had proved he was sane -- and he admits it himself. If you don't want me to run it --
HARTMAN: Oh, that'll be all right, Hildy. Go ahead, run it. And you can say I treated him well, too. 'Lo, Earl. How are you feeling?
WILLIAMS: Fine, thanks, Sheriff.
HARTMAN: That's good, Earl. Oh, they've got another alienist to see you. He ought to be here any minute. Don't go to sleep, will you?
WILLIAMS: I won't.
HARTMAN: Hildy, how'd you like a couple of tickets for the hanging?
HILDY: No, thanks Sheriff. I'm leaving town tonight.
HARTMAN: You ought to stay over. You always wrote a good hanging story, Hildy.
HILDY: That's awful kind of you, Sheriff. I've got to get started on my interview. See you later.
WILLIAMS: Don't forget about production for use.
HILDY: I won't, Earl.
MURPHY: Well, a guy can win when Hildy ain't around.
ENDICOTT: Who's this guy she's gonna marry?
WILSON: Baldwin -- his name is.
SCHWARTZ: I give that marriage six months.
