GRADY: I'm okay. I just lost my balance.
JAMES LEER: I put you on the floor.
GRADY: Oh.
JAMES LEER: I thought you might -- I don't know -- swallow your tongue or something. I guess you really miss her, huh?
GRADY: Huh? Oh, no. This isn't Emily's. I just write in it.
JAMES LEER: I guess there's probably a story behind that.
GRADY: There is, but it's not that interesting.
JAMES LEER: Want me to get that?
GRADY: Sure.
JAMES LEER: He didn't give his name.
GRADY: Who?
JAMES LEER: The guy on the phone.
GRADY: What'd he say?
JAMES LEER: He wanted to know if a Grady Tripp lived here and drove a dark maroon 1966 Ford Galaxie 500 with black interior.
GRADY: What'd you tell him?
JAMES LEER: Yes.
GRADY: Good, James. If the Zodiac killer calls, be sure to mention the back door pops open with a couple hard shakes to the right.
JAMES LEER: I thought maybe you'd won a radio contest or something. Is that single- spaced?
GRADY: Afraid so.
JAMES LEER: That's a big book you're writing.
GRADY: I think it's sort of writing itself at this point.
JAMES LEER: Wow, Hannah always swore you were working, but --
GRADY: But... ?
JAMES LEER: Nothing, it's just that, well, it's been awhile since Arsonist's Daughter, and some people -- some of the kids in workshop -- thought maybe you were...
GRADY: Washed up?
JAMES LEER: Blocked.
GRADY: Ah. I don't believe in writer's block.
