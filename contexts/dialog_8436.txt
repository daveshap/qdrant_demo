ERIN: What? Hey -- <u>he</u> hit <u>me</u>.
DEFENDING LAWYER: So you say.
ERIN: He came tearing around the corner, out of control --
DEFENDING LAWYER: An ER doctor who spends his days saving lives was the one out of control --
ERIN: That asshole smashed in my fucking neck!
ERIN: Open and shut? <u>Open and fucking shut</u>?
ED: If you hadn't used profanity --
ERIN: Oh, please, it was long over by then. God damn, he made me look like some cheap --
ED: I told you the questions might get a little personal --
ERIN: Bullshit. You told me I'd get half a million dollars. You told me I'd be set.
ED: Okay -- let's try and settle down here.
ERIN: <u>Settle down</u>? I got 74 bucks to my name, Mr. Masry! I can't <u>afford</u> to settle down!
ED: I'm sorry, Erin.
ERIN: Yeah? Well, fuck you. Sorry doesn't feed my kids.
