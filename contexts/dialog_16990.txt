ARAMIS: It can. I know the way.
ATHOS: I am with you!
D'ARTAGNAN: No! Stop --
ARAMIS: I will need you all. All for one. One for all.
D'ARTAGNAN: You -- You cannot ask me to betray my king! I have sworn to him!
ATHOS: It is honor you serve, and when the king is dishonorable you are removed from your oath of honor!
D'ARTAGNAN: An oath is an oath precisely because it cannot be removed!
ATHOS: Why do you follow him, d'Artagnan?! I know you have put service above your own life, but why does this King deserve such loyalty? He is a monster! He executes ministers for his own blunders, with their families hostage so they take the blame! He has no honor!
D'ARTAGNAN: No man is all bad... or all good. I believe -- I must believe -- that Louis can learn. And perhaps I can help him.
