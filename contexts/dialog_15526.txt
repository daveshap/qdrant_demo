COLWYN: Forgive me, my friends. I saw terrible things.
TORQUIL: They do not exist, except in the waters of the Swamp, where they will remain.
YNYR: From here, I must go alone.
COLWYN: You will tell me her name and we will go together.
YNYR: You must never know her name. If more than one approaches, she will certainly kill them. Alone I may have a chance.
TORQUIL: Each to his fate, lad.
YNYR: Each to his fate. Wait for me at the inn. If I am not back by dawn, you will know my fate, and you must go on without me.
ERGO: Where are you going?
CYCLOPS: We'll meet you at the inn.
ERGO: Can't I come, too?
CYCLOPS: No.
