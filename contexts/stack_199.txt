How do restore an iOS 12 beta backup to a new iPhone running iOS 11? I have an iPhone 7+ that is running iOS 12 beta. I got a new iPhone X and I want to have it mirror the 7+ by restoring the X from the backup. When I try to do this process, it seems that the X gets the OS wiped and restored to iOS 11, there it is not possible to restore the iOS 12 backup. Is there another way of doing this? Or a workaround? Help! Thanks.
