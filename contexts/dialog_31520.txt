BOND: Who is he?
ELEKTRA: My bodyguard. He follows me everywhere. He’s decisive, vigilant. And he makes an excellent omelette.
BOND: How long has he been with you?
ELEKTRA: Since the kidnapping. Why do you ask?
BOND: Does this look familiar to you?
ELEKTRA: It’s my father’s pin. He wore it everyday of his life.
ELEKTRA: Are you trying to break my heart? Or is it just your way with women?
BOND: It’s not the pin your father wore. It’s an exact duplicate. Inside is a tiny electrical detonator. We have reason to believe the assassin had an inside accomplice, someone who worked at this company.
ELEKTRA: If you’ve come here to look after me, Mr. Bond, thank you, but no thank you. I have two bodyguards, I don’t need a third...
BOND: The killer doesn’t want to see this pipeline continue, doesn’t want to see you take over...
ELEKTRA: That’s every man within a five mile radius. Including you. That’s why you’re here, isn’t it? You think I can’t do it. You think I’m going to screw up. Or get myself killed.
BOND: I think running this pipeline would be a difficult job for anyone. Especially King’s daughter.
ELEKTRA: You are wrong, Mr. Bond. In fact, I am the only person who can do it.
