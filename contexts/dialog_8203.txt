BRILL"": What happened?
DEAN: It started with the information you gave me on DePinto. After we talked, he agreed to resign. Next, a phony detective asked me about Daniel Zavitz. Then an investigator questioned me about an extortion scheme they claimed Zavitz was behind. The FBI started looking into mob connections. A doctored picture in the paper. Overnight, I'm ruined. Wife. job, bank accounts, everything gone.
BRILL"": DePinto's dead.
DEAN: Oh Jesus.
BRILL"": They found him yesterday folded neatly in a car trunk. What about Zavitz?
DEAN: I don't know anything about Zavitz.
BRILL"": You said he was behind an extortion scheme.
DEAN: <u>They</u> said he was behind an extortion scheme.
BRILL"": And you were the last one to talk to him.
DEAN: Yes.
BRILL"": What'd he say to you?
DEAN: Nothing.
BRILL"": What'd he give to you?
DEAN: Nothing.
BRILL"": Don't bullshit me, I can save your life.
DEAN: I'm telling you, I--
DEAN: I just gave him my card.
BRILL"": He didn't give you an address? He didn't give you a phone number?
DEAN: Nothing. Two nights later I was robbed. I'm pretty sure they were pros.
DEAN: Um...who's that?
BRILL"": Don't know. Did you check everywhere? Maybe it was hidden in something. Maybe there was someone else--
DEAN: Someone else?
BRILL"": Maybe you bumped into someone who took it and you didn't even know.
