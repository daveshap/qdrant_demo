I got a job offer I want to turn down, but I have no idea what to say
They offered 7 grand less than the lowest in the range I asked for ($45-55k), there's no health insurance even though the company focuses on health insurance affordability, my commute would be 2-3 hours a day, and I would work 50 hours a week.

 It just doesn't feel right so I want to decline... Unless it's maybe remote. I don't think this job would make me happy... They didn't even bother to call about the offer, just went straight to email. 

How do I answer??
