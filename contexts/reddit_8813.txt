Why did Papadopoulos' lies prevent the FBI from detaining or arresting Professor Mifsud?

The FBI claims that Papadopoulos' lies prevented them from detaining or arresting Professor Mifsud when he was in the United States.

>Seventh, the lies were material to the investigation. The defendant’s lies to the FBI in January 2017 impeded the FBI’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Most immediately, **those statements substantially hindered investigators’ ability to effectively question the Professor when the FBI located him in Washington, D.C. approximately two weeks after the defendant’s January 27, 2017 interview**. The defendant’s lies undermined investigators’ ability to challenge the Professor or potentially detain or arrest him while he was still in the United States. **The government understands that the Professor left the United States on February 11, 2017** and he has not returned to the United States since then.

How did Papadopoulos' statements hinder the investigators' ability to question Professor Mifsud?

##Papadopoulos' False Statements

[These are the lies according to the FBI (PDF):](https://www.justice.gov/file/1007346/download)

>a. Defendant **PAPADOPOULOS claimed that his interactions with an overseas professor**, who defendant PAPADOPOULOS understood to have substantial connections to Russian government officials, **occurred before defendant PAPADOPOULOS became a foreign policy adviser to the Campaign**. Defendant PAPADOPOULOS acknowledged that the professor had told him about the Russians possessing "dirt" on then-candidate Hillary Clinton in the form of"thousands of emails," but stated multiple times that he learned that information prior to joining the Campaign. In truth and in fact, however, defendant PAPADOPOULOS learned he would be an advisor to the Campaign in early March, and met the professor on or about March 14, 2016; the professor only took interest in defendant PAPADOPOULOS because of his status with the Campaign; and the professor told defendant PAPADOPOULOS about the "thousands of emails" on or about April 26, 2016, when defendant PAPADOPOULOS had been a foreign policy adviser to the Campaign for over a month.

>b. Defendant **PAPADOPOULOS further told the investigating agents that the professor was " a nothing" and "just a guy talk[ing] up connections or something."** In truth and in fact, however, defendant **PAPADOPOULOS understood that the professor had substantial connections to Russian government officials** (and had met with some ofthose officials in Moscow immediately prior to telling defendant PAPADOPOULOS about the "thousands of emails") and, over a period of months, defendant PAPADOPOULOS repeatedly sought to use the professor's Russian connections in an effort to arrange a meeting between the Campaign and Russian government officials. 
>
>c. Defendant PAPADOPOULOS claimed he met a certain female Russian national before he joined the Campaign and that their communications consisted of emails such as, '"Hi , how are you?"' In truth and in fact, however, defendant PAPADOPOULOS met the female Russian national on or about March 24, 2016, after he had become an adviser to the Campaign; he believed that she had connections to Russian government officials; and he sought to use her Russian connections over a period ofmonths in an effort to arrange a meeting between the Campaign and Russian government officials.

What stopped the FBI from questioning the professor? Papadopoulos told the FBI the professor was the source of his information. Isn't that enough to do something when the professor is in the country?
