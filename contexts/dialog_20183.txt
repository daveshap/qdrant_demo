LARRY: Yeah, but, what if this guy lived a billion, trillion years ago? Like, what if he was a cave man, and now he's dead?
FAITH: Don't be stupid, Larry. If he's my destiny, then, obviously, he has to be alive.
LARRY: Yeah, but, what if he doesn't live here? Like, what if he's a cannibal in New Guinea or something?
FAITH: If I live here, then he lives here. Fate wouldn't make a mistake like that. And stop talking. You're gonna ruin the spell.
