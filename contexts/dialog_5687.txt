KENNY: Are you O.K.?
JODY: I'm fine.
KENNY: I heard you got attacked.
JODY: I did.
KENNY: I was worried about you. Did you hear about the bash?
JODY: Yeah. I think it's really sick.
KENNY: Why?
JODY: Three of our classmates are dead. That's not really the occasion for a party.
KENNY: Nobody wants to be the fourth. Please go with me.
JODY: Did Sharon say no?
KENNY: You know I want to go with you.
JODY: I'm so flattered but I can't. I'm grounded.
KENNY: Everyone's grounded. There's a killer on the loose.
JODY: No I'm really grounded. When I got in late the other night, my father was waiting up for me.
KENNY: If you don't want to go with me just say so. Say 'Kenny, I DON'T WANT TO MAKE LOVE TO YOU' but don't use your dad as an excuse. I'm so sick of it.
JODY: I'm not using him as an excuse.
KENNY: Yes you are. You always do. It's why we broke up. You always hide behind him.
JODY: I do not.
KENNY: I feel like I NEED YOU DAD'S permission just to kiss you. Jody, it's time to assert yourself To be a big girl. An individual. I'm going to this party tonight. Jimmy's my ride. Come over to my house after school. We'll go together.
JODY: I have to go home after school. I have something really important I have to ask my mom.
KENNY: They're not picking me up until six.
JODY: I'll think about it.
KENNY: Yes!
