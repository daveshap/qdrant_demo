CPU temps reach 90+ *C while compiling OpenCV So I got a used workstation specifically a Lenovo D20.It's configuration is:2x Xeon X5670 (stock speed and cooler)16 GB Registered ECC (4x 4GB)300GB VelociRaptor 10k RPM HDDNvidia Quadro 600Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTSWhile I was compiling OpenCV from source I saw that the Cpu temps from a number of cores were reaching well above 90* C. What could be the issue? All other temps were kinda normal around 45 - 60 *C. Only the core temps used to go that high and then after remaining there for say 4 -5 mins drop to 50 - 60 *C. After that they again climbed up and went down again, till the compilation was done.I was measuring temps using psensor
