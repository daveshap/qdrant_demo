HARRY: You rigged the illusion to fail, right?
VALENTIN: Yes.
HARRY: You paid off the doctor. You set up the fake body. Yes?
VALENTIN: Yes.
HARRY: And then... because I was getting too close to something -- --or someone, you called Swann
VALENTIN: I tried to pay you off.
HARRY: Was that Swann's idea?
VALENTIN: No. It was mine. I didn't want any more bloodshed. That's why we went to all this trouble, so there'd be no one for Nix to come after.
HARRY: Nix is dead and buried, for fuck's sake.
VALENTIN: Haven't you seen enough to know that doesn't matter?
HARRY: I want to see Swann face to face.
VALENTIN: Why don't you leave this alone? Let everybody think it's over?
DOROTHEA: What about me?
VALENTIN: Nix was never interested in you. It was always Swann.
