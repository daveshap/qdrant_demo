Career Center Pros: To Survey or Not to Survey?
Flirting with the idea of a 2-3 question email student survey after each visit with the Career Resource Center. I value transparency and truth, already ask my students when I'm walking them out whether or not they felt the meeting was worthwhile. 

What's your experience with exit surveys after each visit? Is a recurring giveaway (announced on social media to boost traffic/engagement) a good incentive?
