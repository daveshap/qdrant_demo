Got my first real developer job offer that is "contingent on my earning of a bachelors in May 2020", but I technically will be one credit off from graduation due to COVID..?
I managed to get a full-time job offer the week of graduation at a small company (Midwest). It's for an Application Developer role and I'm finishing my Computer Science degree in a few days now and the offer is more than generous. I'm filling out the agreement forms and whatnot, but something that caught my eye was that the offer is "contingent on that I earn a bachelors in May of 2020". The thing is, due to COVID shutdowns, I am missing one science course. (I was at the max credit load this semester. My plan was to study for and pass what is called a CLEP exam for college credit, which would give me the science course I need. See [r/CLEP](https://www.reddit.com/r/CLEP/) for details.)

Well, every place in the country I can take the exam is closed, so I'm kinda just 'Unofficially graduated' until the country opens up. So, **I technically haven't earned my degree in May, 2020.** Is this something that would middle-finger me and get my offer revoked? Wondering if I can just sorta go along and hope it doesn't matter, and get the exam done ASAP when I can.
