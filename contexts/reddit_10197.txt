I told my parents I’m going to kill myself and they just wished me the best
As I was walking out of the door my mum said she hopes that’ll now make me happy. 

Nobody tried to stop me or check if I would be okay.

I’ve told them I feel suicidal about 3 times before, and they’ve pretty much brushed it off like it’s just attention seeking.

Now idk about you but I think that’s pretty fcuked up. 

Of course your child is seeking attention they want to fcuking die because they cannot take life anymore. 

I’m just so sick of everything. I feel like I have no one I can turn to. 

My ex left me, I have no real friends and now my family have turned their back on me.

I just can’t take this anymore.
