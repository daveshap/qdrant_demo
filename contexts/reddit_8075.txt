Terrified of grad school debt, looking for solidarity — am I alone?
Hi there. I’m starting grad school in a major US city in the fall. The program is a great fit for me and it’s highly regarded. The catch is that tuition is ~50k a year. Additionally, my rent will be around $900 a month (a deal considering the city I’ll be living in).

I only have around 5k in savings and the school didn’t offer me any scholarships. In fact, only a few people in this program are offered scholarships and they are pretty small (around 13k). I obviously knew all this when I enrolled but reality has begun to set in and I’m having terrible anxiety about all the loans I’m going to have to take out over the next two years. 

My anxiousness has me assuming that everyone else who is going to grad school is in a better situation than me. I think they must have more savings, have rich parents or they must have gotten hefty scholarships. 

I’m not looking to be told that I made a bad decision. I can’t turn back now. I just want to know if anyone else out there is in a similar situation. 

Am I the only one who will have so much debt?
