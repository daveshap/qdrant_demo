AUDREY: I still can't believe it. How does a guy go from an anti-nuke activists to working for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission?
NICK: When you and I use to attend rallies in college, we helped to create awareness. But from the inside now I can actually effect change. I never lost my idealism.
AUDREY: And exactly what changes are you trying to effect?
NICK: I have this theory that we're inadvertently creating new species as a direct result of what we've done to nature.
AUDREY: And you think this creature is one of them?
NICK: Yes. The first of its kind. I found this blood sample earlier this evening...
AUDREY: Blood sample? How close did you get to that thing?
NICK: I got pretty close.
AUDREY: What else do you know about it?
