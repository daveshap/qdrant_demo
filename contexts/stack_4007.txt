what would be the best way to find out if a student's marks is increasing with the number of attempts he or she takes for a test? Please bear with me. I am quite a beginner in statistics.I want to analyse what would be the best way to find out if a student's marks is increasing with the number of attempts he or she takes for a test?So as to answer that if more practice means better performance?for example for a student in the first attempt he or she scores less marks then as he or she keeps taking more and more attempts his or her performance is increasing/decreasing.Say there is a data set of 40 students.For all the students we have a data set of number of attempts by each student.Now I have to analyse whether more number of attempts by a student means better performance than a student making lesser attempts
