VICTORIA: Mr Brown.
BROWN: Ma'am.
VICTORIA: You are here safely.
BROWN: Aye, ma'am.
VICTORIA: You are well?
BROWN: I am.
VICTORIA: And the pony?
BROWN: She's well, too.
VICTORIA: Your family sent cards. It was much appreciated.
BROWN: I'm glad of it.
VICTORIA: My husband was always very complimentary in speaking of you. He would have approved, I am sure, of my calling on you in this way. I trust it does not inconvenience you too much.
BROWN: I've no family, ma'am, apart from my brothers and sisters.
VICTORIA: Yes. You have a brother in service here, do you not? I forget his name.
BROWN: Archie.
VICTORIA: Yes. That will be company for you.
BROWN: Yes, ma'am.
