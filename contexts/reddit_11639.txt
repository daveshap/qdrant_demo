I have a crush on my asexual/aromantic friend and I feel like a bad person about it
So I've been friends with this girl for about 2 years now and about a year ago I found out that she is asexual (doesn't have sexual feelings towards others) and aromantic (doesn't have romantic feelings towards others) but she's so sweet and I still have a crush on her. And I feel this nagging hope that I want her to somehow change, and I feel like a really awful person and friend for feeling that way.
