Up Close and Personal: The Interview. Here's my Interview Cheat Sheet.
I'm seeing that lots of you are getting invited to interviews and have questions about whether you should do them or not, or what they are all about.  

**Do the interview.** Data for some schools shows a striking difference in acceptance rates for those who interview and those who don’t if the opportunity is available to them. So, if the school offers you an interview, it’s in your best interest to accept. That’s even if they say that the interview is technically “optional” (you do know that there is no such thing as truly "optional" in college admissions language right?).

Lots of schools have different methods for the way they conduct interviews, so you need to **read their websites carefully.** For some, you are automatically put on an interview list when you apply. For others, you have to sign up and arrange it. Additionally, at some schools, they will automatically add you to a list for an off-campus interview if they have them available in your area. 

**Interview time is also an excellent time to start regularly checking your inbox for communications, as well as your spam and junk folders, and make sure you have your voicemail set up and cleared out on your phone. You don’t want to miss any communications from the college** (which you should be opening for demonstrated interest reasons), especially not for something like an interview. Note — one of my own children missed a couple of interviews because he wasn’t checking spam. It was definitely a lesson learned the hard way.

# Advice for nailing the interview

It’s easy to become anxious and stressed about interviews, especially if you’re in the midst of the interview swamp right now. It’s fun, but can be a little sticky, and gooey, and uncomfortable. Or dry and desert-like maybe. Or maybe even moist and dessert-like.

Regardless, you can do this! You’ve made it this far, having surmounted obstacles like grades, extracurriculars, and putting together your application. So instead of stressing, focus all that nervous energy into what you can do right now: prepare.

## Top Ten Potential Questions They Might Ask You

You shouldn’t memorize your answers to these questions, but it won’t hurt to think a little about your answers. Focus on how these questions can help you authentically present yourself, not how you can make yourself seem like the most impressive, perfect candidate of all time (the interviewer will see right through that). 

1. “Tell me about yourself.”
2. “What do you like to do in your free time?” Follow-ups: Be prepared to talk about some of your extracurriculars and why you enjoy them, how you got interested in them, etc. 
3. “Why X College?” Follow-ups: Here you should have specific details — amazing classes or professors or programs you’ve heard about. What first drew you to this college and why do you think you’re a good fit? What will you contribute?
4. “Why do you want to study X?”
5. “What are your strengths and weaknesses?” As follow up: What do you do to remedy those weaknesses?
6. “Describe yourself in 1-3 words.” Some say one. Some say three.
7. Be prepared to talk about “supplemental essay” questions: 
   1. Your favorite X (author, mentor, person, etc.)
   2. An obstacle in your life you’ve overcome
   3. What has influenced you the most in your life
   4. Talk about a time when you had to resolve a conflict
   5. Talk about a time you’ve demonstrated leadership, etc.
8. What are your plans after college? You don’t have to be super specific — maybe say what field you’re generally interested in, and perhaps offer one or two ideas you have in mind and why.
9. “What would you do differently about high school if you had to do it again?”
10. “If an alien offered to take you on an epic space journey, but you could never see your friends and family on Earth again, would you go?” (In my experience, sometimes interviewers like to throw weird or unexpected questions at you just for fun.)

## Preparing for Your Interview

In the days leading up to your interview, instead of preparing and memorizing whole paragraphs to lob at the interviewer, think about why you love the school so much. What is it that you love? Because what you love is the version of “you” that you see there. And “you” will be wherever you go. Figure out how you fit that school (it all comes back to fit!).

I suggest bringing a one-page resume. There are others who disagree with me, so go with your gut, but if the college or the interviewer doesn’t explicitly tell you not to bring a resume or anything, I recommend bringing a one-page highlights resume. This way the recommender has something to refer to as they talk to you and as they later write their notes. Simply hand it to them when you meet them. If they toss it to the side or say they don’t need it, no biggie.  See below for my one-page resume suggestions.

Also, bring a notepad and pen so you can take notes if you like. 

The night before the interview, do the basic but essential preparation stuff — make sure your outfit is clean, pressed, and ready to go. Check out the route to the interview location to anticipate transportation challenges and make sure you make it on time. Go over the next day’s schedule and make sure you’ve given yourself enough time to get to the interview location and get into the right frame of mind. Get a good night’s sleep. 

## Making a Good First Impression

**Appearance**

Contrary to what some students believe, you do not need to wear a suit to your interview. But you must have a tidy, neat appearance.

For example, you could wear a clean shirt with a collar, tucked in, and a clean pair of pants or jeans with a belt (if you have pants other than jeans, wear them). You could also wear a clean skirt or pants with a blouse or shirt, tucked in if appropriate. Or you could wear a nice dress (but nothing too fancy). Wash and brush or comb your hair. No need for anything too elaborate, clean and neat hair is fine. Shave or trim your beard, if you have one, so it looks controlled. If your hair looks a little messy and you think you need a haircut, well, maybe get a haircut.

Wear something you are comfortable in, and that makes you feel confident. However, DO NOT WEAR inappropriate t-shirts or dirty, stained, or torn clothes. Avoid t-shirts, hoodies, and ripped jeans if you can — even if they tell you it’s casual. If you wear tennis shoes, make sure you clean them up. Also, I personally feel like you should take out any piercings beyond ear piercings, but maybe that’s just me being old-fashioned and frumpy *\[AdmissionsSon’s note: yes, that is definitely you being old-fashioned and frumpy, though unfortunately many interviewers are also old-fashioned and frumpy. Students, try to gauge your audience a bit with this one. I’d be totally cool with whatever piercings.\]*

**Arrival**

Arrive early, so you don’t stress yourself out rushing to the interview. Plan how early you need to leave to arrive 15 minutes early, and then leave 15 minutes before that time. So yes, you might be 30 minutes early. That’s ok. When you get there, go to the bathroom. After you take care of your business, look at yourself in the mirror and put your hands on your hips and stand up nice and tall. Do the Superman Pose and take some deep breaths.

**Introductions**

Smile! Don’t force a big fake smile, but you’re not at a funeral, right? Again, the interview is going to be like a little chat between you and the interviewer. You might as well relax and try to enjoy it a little bit.

Make eye contact. This is very important. Make sure you look the interviewer in the eye, so they know you’re engaged and paying attention. But like, not too much. It’s not a staring contest. Just be confident but natural. 

Introduce yourself. The easiest and most casual, confident way to do this is to simply state your name during the handshake.

Shake hands. Think of a good handshake as about the degree of firmness you would need to hold onto a doorknob to open a door.

## During the Interview

Put your phone away.  Silence it and tuck it away. Don’t take it out again until after the interview. The only exceptions would be something like they ask to see a picture of an art project you did and you happen to have one on your phone. If you do show them a picture, make sure there’s nothing potentially embarrassing to scroll past!

Remember to breathe.

Listen to your interviewer. The one piece of advice that the Admissions Counselors for Colleges ask us to share with you is for you just to come and listen to the questions and respond. Don’t come with an agenda of what you want to say or come off as overly practiced. They could end up noting that in their write-up.

Being nervous is ok. Own it. Many of you are shy and introverted. Lean into your nerves. You can tell the interviewer. They might be too, and this will help them know to help you along. Your interviewer’s not looking to catch you in an awkward moment or waiting for a mistake to pounce on. They don’t want you to fail.

## After The Interview

Ask for a business card so you can write a thank you note to your interviewer! When you get home after the interview, jot down a quick thank you note and send it in. Here’s a good rule of thumb — if your interviewer is your parents’ age or older, a hand-written thank you note will be great if you have his or her home address (without creepy internet snooping); otherwise, an email is fine. Be gracious, be grateful for their time, and be sure to bring up something they talked about in the email. Don’t worry if you don’t hear back from them. It doesn’t mean anything at all.

**THE RESUME**

In most cases, the interviewer, especially if they are an alum interviewer, won't have any heads up about your application, so this gives them something to work through.

HEADING: Your full name, ID # for that school, email address, cell phone number, and home address 

EDUCATION: High School (s), GPA, SAT, ACT, SAT Subject, and AP or IB scores if they are helpful (note-i had a redditor tell me last week that some schools want to be sure you don't include your GPA or test scores. I'd never heard that before, but obvy if they say that to you, then leave that part out)

EXTRACURRICULARS: what do you do outside of school? It doesn’t have to be a school organized activity. 

WORK EXPERIENCES 

SUMMER EXPERIENCES 

HONORS AND AWARDS 

SKILLS and INTERESTS 

Obviously, this is you distilled into one page, so brevity is key. They may or may not look at the resume, but that’s ok. You just hand it to them when you get there. Some will politely set it aside or just say they don’t need. Others will refer to it and use it for notes. It’s out of your hands once you pass it to them.

&#x200B;

**INTERVIEW NO-NOs**

Don’t treat the interview as the magical ritual that will automatically get you admitted to the school of your choice. As stressed above, this should be a conversation, not an audition, not a monologue. You need to treat your interviewer with respect. Above all else, you need to let your best self shine through.

To achieve that goal, avoid these common interview mistakes:

* Arriving late
* Wearing dirty, torn clothes
* Having your phone out/Looking at your phone
* Offering a limp handshake 
* Being over-prepped
* Spewing canned answers that sound like you’ve tried to memorize them
* Coming with an agenda of what you want to or think you should talk about
* Not listening to the interviewer! The number one thing admissions officers and alums tell me to tell students is to LISTEN in interviews. They say far too many students come with rehearsed responses and you are not actually listening and responding to the questions presented to you. Listen. Be present. Smile. Engage. Breathe.

# tl;dr

* Whatever it looks like, an invitation for a college admissions interview is awesome! It’s an excellent opportunity to have one-on-one and personalized contact with the school, and it adds a lot of useful information to your application.
* There are different ways to get an interview — you might be invited, or you might have to sign up. Keep an eye on your email inbox (check spam and voicemail too) and read the admissions page website for more information!
* Don’t be upset if you don’t get a ton of interview requests, or if you don’t get any at all. Lots of kids get into amazing colleges without an interview.
* Don’t overthink your interview performance. That means you should not memorize answers ahead of time. 
* Before, during, and after the interview, put your best foot forward. Look clean and neat, be attentive and polite, and send a thank you note afterward.
