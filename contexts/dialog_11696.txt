BLAKE: That's it?
CARTER: Care to join me?
BLAKE: Come on, Carter. You know it's Michael.
CARTER: What do you want me to do, put out an A.P.B. on a man in overalls wearing a white mask dragging a headstone?
BLAKE: Yes.
CARTER: Sweet dreams, Blake.
KERI: Shit, John! What the hell were you doing out there?!
JOHN: Nothing.
KERI: You're kidding with that answer, right?
JOHN: I just went for a walk. It's no big deal.
KERI: Wrong. There are rules in this house and you're going to follow them whether you like it or not.
JOHN: Or what? You're gonna shoot me?
KERI: It's an option.
JOHN: Well, maybe if you'd let me live in the dorms, I wouldn't have to sneak out to spend time with my friends.
KERI: Oh, so now it's my fault?
JOHN: Just forget it...
