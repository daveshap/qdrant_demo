Read it and believe it.
Your anxiety is lying to you. You are strong and great. You can accomplish all those dreams. You are not a burden, you are a blessing. You are great in what you do. Your anxiety is telling you lies in your own voice.

No one gives a shit how you do things. So do it anyway without thinking anything.
Just go on and don't think... You can achieve everything you ever wanted.
Just believe yourself.

Update: You can't run away from your anxieties throughout your life. You have to be bold, confident and brave to face it. And when you face your fears you are going to win and then you will be happy.
