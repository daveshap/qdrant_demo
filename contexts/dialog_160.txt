ROSE: Yeah. He wanted a girl from Czechoslovakia, but I sent him Honey 'cause once they get there, you know, it doesn't really matter - Honey was killed...? Poor girl...
EDDIE: Do you have any Czech girls working for you?
ROSE: No.
EDDIE: Did you tell him you did?
ROSE: Boy, she's so popular all the sudden.
EDDIE: What are you saying?
ROSE: Daphne. Another guy came in asking me about her, too.
