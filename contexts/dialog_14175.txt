KING: What happened?
ANDREWS: I haven't the slightest idea.
ANDREWS: Don't want to talk toâ€”don't want to talk to anybody. Don't want to see anybody.
SECRETARY: But it's King Westley on the phone.
ANDREWS: Ooooooh. Hello my would-be ex-son-in-law. I've sent you a check for a hundred thousand. Yes. That's the smartest thing you ever did, Westley, not to contest that annulment. That's satisfactory, isn't it? Yeah. Well, it ought to be. Oh I'm not complaining. It was dirt cheap. Don't fall out of any windows.
SECRETARY: There's another wire from Peter, sir. They're in Glen Falls, Michigan.
ANDREWS: What's holding up the annulment
WIFE: Funny couple, ain't they?
MAN: Yeah.
WIFE: If you ask me, I don't believe they're married.
MAN: They're married all right. I just seen the license.
WIFE: They made me get 'em a rope and a blanket, on a night like this.
MAN: Yeah?
WIFE: What do you reckon that's for?
MAN: Blamed if I know. I just brung 'em a trumpet.
WIFE: A trumpet?
MAN: Yeah. You know, one of those toy things. They sent me to the store to get it.
WIFE: But what in the world do they want a trumpet for?
MAN: I dunno.
