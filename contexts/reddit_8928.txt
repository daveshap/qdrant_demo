What started the investigation(s) into the Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, and what charges have the police already recommended against him? Is there evidence to support Netanyahu's claim the investigation is biased against him?
There have been [several investigations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investigations_involving_Benjamin_Netanyahu_2016%E2%80%93present) into the current Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu. 

Some of [these investigations](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/02/world/middleeast/netanyahu-cases-guide.html?module=inline) have dealt with '*gifts for tax favors*' and '*a proposed deal for good press.*'

Police have [recommended charges](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/02/world/middleeast/israel-netanyahu-bribery-charges.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer) for a variety of offenses in the past.

Netanyahu on Monday night used a live television address to [talk about the investigations against him](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/07/world/middleeast/netanyahu-israel-indict-speech.html):

> Mr. Netanyahu railed against a corruption investigation into his dealings with several Israeli media tycoons that is widely expected to culminate soon in an indictment on bribery and other criminal charges.

> The investigation was “biased,” Mr. Netanyahu complained. He demanded an opportunity to confront the state’s witnesses, on television, before any potential trial, so all Israelis “will know the whole truth.”

One of Netanyahu's allies has suggested he was being framed by the Israeli Ministry of Justice:

> Mr. Netanyahu’s coalition chief, David Amsalem, recently suggested that the prime minister was being framed and that “millions of people won’t accept this.”

I have a few questions:

1: What started the most recent investigation into Benjamin Netanyahu, and more generally, other corruption investigations?

2: Exactly what charges have been laid out against Netanyahu and his allies?

3: Is there any evidence the prosecutors and the Israeli Ministry of Justice hold an unworkable bias against Netanyahu or are 'framing' him?
