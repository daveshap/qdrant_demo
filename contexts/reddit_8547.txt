Is any society successfully pushing back against the populist wave and how?
At the moment populism is on the rise in many western states and we see populists elected in parliaments in pretty much every election now in bigger and bigger numbers.^(1) Just few days ago in Latvian^(2) and Czech^(3) parliamentary elections, parties that can be defined as populist, both got second place. Is there evidence that any society is successfully pushing back against populist parties? Historically, how have societal trends toward populism been reversed?

I also wanted to say thanks to the moderator of this subreddit u/nosecohn, who helped me a lot with reworking my initial post. By far this is the best subreddit with the best mods on reddit!
