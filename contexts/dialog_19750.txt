HAROLD: Hey ... you'll be able to do it now.
RICHARD: What ... ?
HAROLD: Go to law school. Mom and Dad'll be able to afford it now ...
HAROLD: Mom expects great things from you ...
RICHARD: Harold ... can I get you anything?
HAROLD: Relax, Dick, it's just me ... The desert's so beautiful, isn't it? I want to go home, Dick. Time to go home.
RICHARD: You're not gonna quit on me, are you, Harold?
