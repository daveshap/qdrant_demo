From furloughed to laid off
Got the call this morning from my boss that they unfortunately have to move me from furloughed to laid off. Get 2 week severance and recommendations which is nice but man does this feeling suck. Just feeling down and out. Iâ€™m an experienced recruiter/HR partner but the job search has not been going well for me.
