Does anyone else get tired of people telling them to exercise as if thats a cure-all?
I know exercise is a wonderful tool, and can be great at helping get rid of that excess energy while also helping maintain good health. But sometimes it feels like being told "have you ever considered exercising or dieting?" invalidates my current efforts to healing myself. I'd just like to be supported for finally reaching out to a psychiatrist and therapist.
