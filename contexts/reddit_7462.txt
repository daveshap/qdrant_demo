Will I be in trouble for allowing my students to submit assignments after the deadlines have passed?
I am a graduate teaching assistant. Ever since the classes transitioned to online system, some of my students who used to submit assignments regularly and within deadlines have stopped doing so. Next week is the last week of classes, and I was thinking of sending an email to my class informing that I will accept any assignment submissions if a student has missed one. I decided not to reach out to student on a personal basis because it might make them uncomfortable in case they were not submitting homework on purpose. The pandemic has impacted our lives in unexpected ways, and there is just no way to gauge the extent of collateral damage here. I thought that some leniency will definitely help my students.

But, is it within my rights to do so? At this point, I donâ€™t even care about any rules that normally prohibit accepting late submissions cause such rules were not made taking situations like these into account. I would love to hear your opinion on this matter.
