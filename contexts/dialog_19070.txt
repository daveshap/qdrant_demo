JOSEPHINE: Ah, how nice to meet you, General Bonaparte. One has read so much about you lately. Please sit down.
NAPOLEON: Thank you, Madame de Beauharnais. You probably don't recall but we met briefly a few months ago, at a party at Paul's house.
JOSEPHINE: Oh... yes, of course! Have you met my daughter, Hortense?
NAPOLEON: Yes, we introduced ourselves at the door.
JOSEPHINE: May I offer you a drink?
NAPOLEON: Oh, I don't want to put you to any inconvenience.
JOSEPHINE: Oh, it's not the slightest inconvenience, General Bonaparte. It is an honor to have you here.
NAPOLEON: You are very kind, Madame de Beauharnais. Do you have some sherry, perhaps?
JOSEPHINE: Yes, of course. Hortense, darling, will you tell Louise to bring some sherry?
