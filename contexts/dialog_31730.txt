FREDDY: Just passing through the night.
INGA: What's wrong, Doctor? You seem... lonely.
FREDDY: Oh, a little. But it's not just physical loneliness. It's the pangs that come from missing someone intellectually... as I have you.
INGA: I've missed you intellectually, too, Doctor.
FREDDY: It's terrible -- the price society demands in the name of fidelity... ultimately?
INGA: Not fooling around.
FREDDY: I know, but I mean -- not fooling around physically?... Or not fooling around intellectually?
INGA: I see what you mean.
FREDDY: There can never... ever... be anything physical between us. You know that, dear.
INGA: I know Frederick.
FREDDY: It wouldn't be fair to Elizabeth.
INGA: Of course not.
