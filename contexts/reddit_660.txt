Help me!!!
 So I have been crushing on this girl for a while and I only recently hung out with her one on one. And we hit it off great it seemed to go really well. But the problem is I don’t know if she thinks of me as a friend or more than. Also if she thinks of me as a friend is that subject to change but I also don’t want to push her away. To sum it up how do I figure out if she likes me or not without loosing her as a friend?
