VAL: Rhonda's got an idea about that.
RHONDA: Yes, see, they move very easily through the Pleistocene Alluvials... ...the dirt...the loose soil that makes up the valley floor. But they can't move through solid rock. I think we should travel west to the mountains.
EARL: You know, up the jeep trail.
RHONDA: The mountains are solid granite. We'd be safe there, and we could hike along them...all the way to Bixby if we have to.
