MULLIGAN: Well, Spats Colombo - if I were saw one.
SPATS: Hello, copper. What brings you down to Florida?
MULLIGAN: I heard you opera-lovers were having a little rally - so I thought I better be around in case anybody decides to sing.
SPATS: Big joke!
MULLIGAN: Say, Maestro - where were you at three o'clock on St. Valentine's Day?
SPATS: Me? I was at Rigoletto.
MULLIGAN: What's his first name? And where does he live?
SPATS: That's an opera, you ignoramus.
MULLIGAN: Where did they play it - in a garage on Clark Street?
SPATS: Clark Street? Never heard of it.
MULLIGAN: Ever hear of the DeLuxe French Cleaners on Wabash Avenue?
SPATS: Why?
MULLIGAN: Because the day after the shooting you sent in a pair of spats - they had blood on them.
SPATS: I cut myself shaving.
MULLIGAN: You shave with your spats on?
SPATS: I sleep with my spats on.
MULLIGAN: Quit kidding. You did that vulcanizing job on Toothpick Charlie - and we know it.
SPATS: You and who else?
MULLIGAN: Me and those two witnesses whom your lawyers have been looking for all over Chicago.
SPATS: You boys know anything about any garage - or any witnesses?
