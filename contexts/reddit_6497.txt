Best Corporate jobs with full benefits - medical especially .. (in the USA)
Can we start making a list of corporate companies that are good to work for? I said corporate bc I’m tired of the small office “rules change by the mood of owner” type thing , and I’m also looking longevity , medical , 401 k and vacation would be nice . 

Any suggestions.   ?

Edit: I have worked in healthcare before , I wouldn’t mind going back . However I was looking to try something different , which was how I ended up in this family business environment . These are great ideas so far! Thank you! 🥇❤️
