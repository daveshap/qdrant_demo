qemu/kvm snapshot with non-usb device I have a fully-working QEMU virtual machine (ubutu host, XP guest). I cannot save the machine state into a snapshot because I have a PCIe card attached to the VM. The error message says \u00abRequested operation is not valid: domain has assigned non-USB host devices\u00bb. The \u201cnon-USB device\u201d is the PCIe card. When I detach it from the VM, the snapshot works flawlessly. The reason for the error is (I suppose) that the PCIe card may suffer changes between the creation and the restoring of the snapshot, so this is disabled by default.Is there a way around this? I absolutely need the PCIe card on the XP guest, and I have actually detached it from the host, so the host never uses it. But I\u2019d like to be able to use snapshots on the VM, as my work involves working with several different programs in XP.
