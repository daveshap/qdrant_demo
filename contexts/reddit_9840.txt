Career Fair Prep
Do any of you do any work with your Career Management Center to get your students ready for a Career Fair? My office has recently started programming for student prior to the Career Fair to help them get ready, particularly when it come to clothes and looking good. Currently, we do the following things: 

1. Clothes Closet - We look for donations from the University Community of gently used professional clothing that we then will give to students for when they walk around the Fair. We will ask for some things back, but will also let the students keep the outfits if it's all they have access to. We will also go shopping at Goodwill if donations aren't enough.
2. Career Fair Fashion Show - We host a fashion (complete with music and a runway) in a busy area of campus during the student common lunch hour to show students what they should (and shouldn't) wear to a Career Fair.
3. Sponsored buses to Men's Warehouse and Anne Taylor (because they both give our student's a discount on clothes)
4. Table tents in student dining areas
5. Advertisements in the school's newspaper and daily electronic newsletter, as well as Social Media postings

Are your offices doing anything else that you think has been helpful to your students when it comes to helping them navigate career fairs? Our Career Management Officer takes charge of the programming that focuses on interview basics.
