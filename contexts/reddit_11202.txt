My step dad beat me.
I'd like to say yes the Police know. 

Depressed, unemployed, lonely and sad. I have no friends, my Mom sided with my step dad and is more angry at me than him. My real dad is furious. 

My jaw won't close all the way, I have 2 black eyes and a huge bump on my head, I can't chew food properly. 

The dudes an alcoholic, drug user who is just an asshole. I told him, he pushed me and I pushed back. One thing lead to another and there I am pinned against a chair having my head pounded in 5-10 times. I don't remember. 

My mom was furious with me. Apparently a ploy to separate them. 

I don't know where I am with life. I have no friends, I'm unemployed, depressed. I think about just ending it all, all the time. I feel no support from my family at all (only my dad, but he's controlling)I try to be happy, and for the most part I feel happy, but I can't seem to make and keep others happy. 

My skype is iilovemiley and Im Nick. I wouldn't mind a friend, or someone to talk to.
