HENRY: I can't eat, just get me some coffee.
HENRY: He was jumpy. He hadn't touched a thing. In the old days, Jimmy would have ordered doubles and eaten it all. On the surface, of course, everything was supposed to be fine. We were supposed to be discussing my case, just like we always would, but I had a feeling Jimmy was trying to sense whether I was going to rat him out to save my neck.
JIMMY: I think you got a good shot at beating the case.
HENRY: How?
JIMMY: It's that rat bastard from Pittsburgh. He ratted you all out. He's been a rat since he got busted in Pittsburgh.
HENRY: Yeah.
JIMMY: He's hiding, thE son of a bitch, in Florida.
HENRY: Yeah.
JIMMY: I want you and Anthony to go down there and take care of that bastard. Without him, they've got no case.
