How to stretch a time series to any length, n, without padding? What algorithms are most suitable if I want to strect a time series to a certain length, n. I dont want to just pad the time series with values at the beginning or end, I want the pattern of the data to be followed but with values added anywhere within the time series to make it length n. For example if i have a time series of 4 values: {1, 5, 7, 4} and want to stretch it to 7 values then it would change to: {1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 5.5, 4} and if it was strecthed to 6 values it would still follow the same pattern of the data so it might be something like: {1, 3.5, 5 ,7, 5, 4 } - (this isnt mathematically correct but i hope you get the point)I would also want this to be applied to a time series that contains x, y, z coordinates eg {x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2, ... xn, yn, zn} with the same type of strecthing applied but it takes into account the x, y and z values being related.Edit:The x, y and z values are the coordinates of a person that is being tracked. So the time series is tracking the movement and actions of a person in a room. For example the person could be running, walking, and moving thoughout the room and the x,y,z coordinates of the person as they are doing that is being tracked.
