MR. JONES: Okay, here's mine. My name is Special Agent Jones.
TALLEY: Are all of you named Jones?
MR. JONES: Don't be funny, Chief. You can't afford it.
MR. JONES: In a few minutes the white phone is going to ring. So let's get our shit straight before that happens.
TALLEY: You used to be a cop. All of you used to be cops. I can tell by the way you move.
MR. JONES: Don't worry about what we used to be.
TALLEY: How do you people expect this to work? The Sheriffs have a Crisis Response Team here.
MR. JONES: What's my name?
TALLEY: What?
MR. JONES: I asked you my name. You just saw my commission slip. What's my fucking name?
TALLEY: Special Agent Jones.
MR. JONES: Think of me that way and you won't fuck up. I'll handle the Sheriffs.
TALLEY: What are you people going to do?
MR. JONES: You and I are gonna straighten this out with the Sheriffs, and then we'll wait for the man to call. When he gives the word, we move.
TALLEY: What does he have on you? I know why I'm doing this, but what does he have on you?
