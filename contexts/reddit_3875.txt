Slow Yo' Motha F****** Roll!!!
Seriously. I read many posts on here which can be more or less summed up as.

"I met this <potential partner> on <dating app> and we really hit it off and had an amazing connection. We hung out <3x-7x per week> for <less than 1 month> and had a lot of sex. Then when I caught feelings and pushed for a relationship they <ghosted/told me no/friendzone/FWB'd me.> I'm really hurt what do I  do?

Let me tell you what you can do:

#SLOW YOUR MOTHER FUCKING ROLL!!!

Seriously. Stop getting crazy attached to people you *literally barely know* and meet on dating apps. If you want a relationship, a real relationship and are tired of getting used for sex/your time stop jumping headfirst into them with strangers. Like that's a recipe for failure.


I'm not saying be a nun. I'm not saying that you need to wait a million dates to fuck someone.

I am saying **temper your expectations**. Seriously. I get that in the modern world, instant gratification is the thing. In the world of relationships, it is decidedly NOT a thing for most people. Having sex with a stranger 5x a week for a month and expecting a long term relationship out of it is setting yourself up for failure. You might have some success, but you'll have less than failures.

If you want some real shit with a compatible person, be patient. Stop rushing into things, step back and observe whether this sexy stranger is someone who you appreciate and vice versa. 

Be less like a puppy dog and more like a cat in your approach to strange potential partners.

Good luck.
