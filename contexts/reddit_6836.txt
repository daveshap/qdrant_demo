How likely is it that I am going to be fired?
So not only has my boss and other manger mentioned that I haven’t been performing well, but one of them also asked “do you want to be here?” To which, I pretty much said “no.” They also mentioned I wasn’t making a very good case for myself (obviously to keep me around). I’ve pretty much sealed the deal that I’m going to get fired right?
