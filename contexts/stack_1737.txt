Can I change op-amp supply voltage without affecting circuit behaviour I am working on an audio project which is based upon various sections of several different schematics from various old musical instruments.I want to make a test board that has multiple different active filter and eq circuits that I have pulled from the old schematics. So that I can play around and compare them.In many cases, these schematics are built around the same op-amps, or filter ICs (vintage SSM/CEM filter ics) but the bi-polar supply voltages to these ics vary from product to product. Some operate on +/- 12V some on +/-15V I even have one that works on +/-18V.Obviously, it gets more complicated to have multiple different voltages on my board, so my question is, can I standardise the bi-polar supply to all circuits without it changing the characteristics or frequency response, or would the complete circuits need to be rescaled?If the latter is true, where do I even start?thank you
