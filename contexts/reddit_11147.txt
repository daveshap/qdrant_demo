Things girls actually care about
Before reading please consider this is not meant to take 100% literally. This is a generalization. Some points may not apply to you, and others may be cultural. It extremely important to main the niceness of your cock and to take everything with a grain of salt. 


The amount of “I’m lonely, I need to be in a relationship” posts are insane so I decided to put together a small little list. 

1. Basic hygiene. I think that most guys under estimate how much of an impact just not smelling like a sweat ball can make. The opposite is also true. Please do not smell like the inside of a can of axe. 

2. Ability to take care of yourself.  By this I mean you don’t have to have a six pack by any means, just show that you care about yourself. It can even be as simple as just having some sort of outlet wether that be athletic or artistic, or even just dressing semi nicely (doesn’t mean expensively), it doesn’t really matter. It’s pretty obvious, if you can’t take care of yourself, there’s no way you’re ready for a relationship. 

3. Being authentic with a personality. It’s so easy to see when someone’s genuinely happy vs when they’re just trying to fit in. Be yourself, and be confident. If nothing else, be confident that you are yourself.  If you aren’t confident, just fake it till you make it. Ask yourself, “if the most confident person in the world was here, in my shoes, what would they do?”, then just do that regardless of how hard it may be. Also having a personality goes along ways. Don’t be different just for the sake of being different, but at the same time, be unique, be you. 

4. Treating us like normal human beings.  We are not sex objects, and thus should not be treated as such (I’m a bad example of this lol). This isn’t some third wave feminism bullshit, it’s just about basic levels of respect. Being female doesn’t make us superior or inferior, we are just as anxious, awkward and uncomfortable as you guys (I think so anyways). Being able just talk to us normally goes a long ways. 

5. Not pushing things TOO far. For better or worse girls will almost never make the first move, it’s almost a pride thing if I’m being honest, but we will drop hints ([this comment contains further information regarding the different ways that “hints” are generally displayed](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/hojv83/things_girls_actually_care_about/fxicxss/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf)). Generally if we haven’t made it abundantly clear you’re friend zoned, you haven’t been. In that regard don’t befriend a girl in hopes of perusing a relationship. It’s like asking to be friend zoned then getting annoyed that you get friend zoned, no one wins ([check out this comment which inspired this point](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/hojv83/things_girls_actually_care_about/fxip0wp/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf) ).  Also please respect their decision. If you ask and we say no, it’s not changing, but honestly 9/10 times it’s a yes.  



No goes:

- smelly (ew)

- Self loathing (be confident)

- Don’t try to be someone you aren’t

- Self entitlement 

- Egotistical. There’s sort of a grey area on this one and comes down to personal preference, but in general being self confident is a great thing, but being overly so can be an instant no go. 


Bonus points:

- If you are good with either children kids or pets (will melt our hearts)

- Having a sense of humour goes a long way in having a good personality. 

- Being self aware of your flaws, but not overly self conscious 

- When complimenting be specific. Say something about her that is only relevant to her. It just shows that you actually care about her. 

- Ability to communicate in general and be open emotionally (emotional maturity). The strong silent type might work for some, but 9 times out of 10 it comes across as being completely emotionally immature (which by the way is also a no go)

- Not complaining when we inevitably start taking your clothes



That all being said, I’d be lying if I said looks had nothing to do with it. We all LIKE the body, generally it’s the person we fall in LOVE with. For all you gamer guys it’s like an RTX 2060 with built in RGB vs an RTX 2080ti without RGB. It’s what’s underneath that we actually appreciate.  



I love you, have a fantastic day.  
Also sorry for shitty formatting, on mobile :)
