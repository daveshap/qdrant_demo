How do I check which cards I\u2019ve collected? There are 52 playing cards hidden as collectibles throughout The Sexy Brutale. (7 of hearts, king of diamonds, etc).While cards are initially identified by name when picked up, the progress menu only shows the total number of cards collected (50/52). This makes it seemingly impossible to tell which cards are missing.Is there a way to check which cards I\u2019ve collected so far?
