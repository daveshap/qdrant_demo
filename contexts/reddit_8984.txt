Under the Fixed Term Parliaments Act, are there any circumstances under which the Queen could dismiss the UK Prime Minister?
Boris Johnson, the newly appointed UK Prime Minister, is currently supported based on party breakdown [by a majority of exactly 1 MP](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/02/what-would-it-take-for-boris-johnson-to-lose-his-majority-of-one-tories-labour) in the House of Commons.  Given this precarious position, and the impending [Brexit deadline of October 31](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-47889404) there has been considerable discussion of the possibility that Johnson will face (and possibly lose) a no confidence vote from the House of Commons when Parliament returns in September.  Opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn [has said he will bring such a motion.](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/jeremy-corbyn-fight-block-no-18836509)

Senior aide to Johnson Dominic Cummings [has been reported as saying](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/boris-johnson-to-defy-any-vote-of-no-confidence-s28ksnhzm) that in the event of a no confidence vote, Johnson would refuse to resign.  

Under the [Fixed Term Parliaments Act of 2011](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/14/section/2/enacted) when there is a vote "That this House has no confidence in Her Majesty’s Government" there are 14 days for the House to vote affirmative confidence in a new government, or else an early election happens.

The [Cabinet Manual](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/60641/cabinet-manual.pdf) (at p. 15, part 2.19) describes the process as follows:

>Under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act
2011, if a government is defeated on a
motion that ‘this House has no confidence
in Her Majesty’s Government’, there is
then a 14-day period during which an
alternative government can be formed
from the House of Commons as presently
constituted, or the incumbent government
can seek to regain the confidence of the
House. If no government can secure the
confidence of the House of Commons
during that period, through the approval of
a motion that ‘this House has confidence
in Her Majesty’s Government’, a general
election will take place. Other decisions
of the House of Commons which have
previously been regarded as expressing ‘no
confidence’ in the government no longer
enable or require the Prime Minister to hold
a general election. **The Prime Minister is
expected to resign where it is clear that he
or she does not have the confidence of the
House of Commons and that an alternative
government does have the confidence.** 

If the Prime Minister does not resign as the Cabinet Manual expects, or there is a dispute as to whether an alternative government does have the confidence of the Commons, does the Queen retain the reserve power of dismissal?

The only modern example of the dismissal power being used I can find is the [1975 Australian constitutional crisis.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1975_Australian_constitutional_crisis)  Are there any other examples in UK history especially that could be illuminating?
