How to get into the theme park industry?
I have a degree in marketing & finance, looking to get into the field fresh out of college. I don't see any entry level positions that are full time really outside of retail/f&b, which would be a waste of my degree. I would love to work in marketing/branding for Universal/any major theme park player.
