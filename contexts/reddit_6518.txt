Taking a job at a think tank with political views you severely disagree with?
I would just be the office manager, and the pay and benefits are really great.  I've been struggling to find a new job for months and this is the best prospect I've had yet.

However, I find the extreme nature of their views to be flat out comical (see below) and impossible to respect. Their blog posts often read like very jargon-y conspiracy theories and they repeatedly post climate change skepticism, which I find abhorrent.  I am also concerned it would be really hard to explain to future employers and would be a stain on my resume that would not be representative of who I am as a person or employee.  Is it worth it to take a job with an organization you hate and would be embarrassed to associated yourself with if you don't have a DIRECT hand in what they do and aren't 200% desperate for it?  I'm totally stumped.

TL;DR: Their organization is OBSESSED with the ultimate power of the unfettered free market and yet they are almost completely supported by donations. While I am very opinionated, I generally don't feel the need to express my political views at work but this would be A LOT to ignore.
