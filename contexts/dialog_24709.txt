DAVID LEE: Who's winning, Mama?
REBECCA: Nobody yet -- it's all tied up.
IKE: If they heard me sing like this up North I'd be richer than the man I sharecrop for.
NATHAN LEE: And if they saw me pitch the way I did today -- they'd hire me just to strike out Babe Ruth!
DAVID LEE: What do they do in the white churches, Mama?
REBECCA: Same as we -- they pray.
IKE: You know, one time by mistake I went into a white church down in Row County and to this day I don't know how'n the devil I got outta that church alive.
NATHAN LEE: They probly thought you was crazy.
IKE: I guess so -- but I went home and did me some praying to the Lord. I said, Lord, I went into this white church down in Row and all I want you to tell me is how I ever got outta there in one piece.
NATHAN LEE: What did the Lord tell you, Ike?
IKE: He said, I don't know, Ike -- you doin' better'n me, I been tryin' to git in there for 200 years and ain't make it yet!
REBECCA: If there ever was a devil in this county, Ike, you is it!
NATHAN LEE: Ike, you could make a song outta that!
