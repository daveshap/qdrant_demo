BOB: Better pass them over here before something happens to 'em.
JESSE: All right, settle down. All this money ain't ours.
BOB: Well, no, Jesse, it was the bank's. That's why we had to go to all that trouble of stealing it. You explain it to him.
JESSE: We oughta take some of this, give it to our neighbors in Liberty. Lot of people hurting up there.
