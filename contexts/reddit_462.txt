Electrocution??
Hello!! ^^ I havent posted on here in a while!! I haven't recently ran into any creeps which is fortunate!! ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ so instead I have a question! I sleep with my phone charged in by my bed and i lay it on my bed far away from me when im sleeping, yet my dad still comes in my room and lectures me about unplugging it because I'll get "electrocuted"...I get that he's concerned but ever since I had a phone Ive been doing this and nothing has happened, the charger doesn't even heat up! I try to tell him this and that I'm safe but he never takes me seriously or listens to me for any reason at all because "Im younger" so I just give up and I dont say anything. Would my phone actually electrocute me?? Isnt it just the same as me plugging in my nightlight?? (Which is also near my bed, it uses the same outlet as my phone, and its plugged in longer than my phone is) I wont make a big fuss over it cause that would be silly but I'm just very curious to know if thats actually hazardous, usually I wouldnt be asking this kind of stuff but he thinks everything is dangerous and that's not an exaggeration...I can't go outside or sleep over by family and Im almost 18. What do I do??
