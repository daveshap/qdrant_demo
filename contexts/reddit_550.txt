Reddit, i have an emergency and need help. I need to write an appeal letter for my reasonable absences. This can make or break me graduating.
Hello reddit! I am a senior in highschool and only have about a month of school left. But the problem is I have about 30 absences in two of my classes and 25 in the rest of my classes. This year has been hell for me and my family. My grandfather and aunt passed away and it really was a powerful blow for all of us. But before I make this a sob story I want to ask for help. I have a chance to graduate but I have to write an appeal letter for my school saying why I was absent and basically ask the principle to pass me for the year. I'm begging anyone out there to help me make a well written persuasive letter to him. The letter would include the following: -I was absent because of family death -my immune system is weak -I have many allergies such as; pollen, any seafood, and any nut. -Also I would have had a doctors note but I have to pay 20$ every time I go there and my family isn't exactly "well off". -I attended a Saturday attendance program for nine days which is used to recover absences. THANK YOU so much for anyone who chooses to help. Any help is appreciated.
