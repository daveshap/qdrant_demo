To what degree is Aung San Suu Kyi the genuine ruler of Burma, and to what degree is she responsible for the Rohingya persecution?
Aung San Suu Kyi is the "State Counsellor of Myanmar", and is described by the BBC as the "de facto leader" of that country [[source](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-41139319)] .  To what extent is she actually in charge?  Could she pick up a phone and have the security forces stop attacks on the Rohingya, or does she have no practical power over how the security services behave?
