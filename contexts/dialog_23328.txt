MRS. ACKERMAN: Young man, this Faberge Egg is chipped.
VENDOR: Yes, ma'am, it is.
MRS. ACKERMAN: I'll give you fifty cents.
VENDOR: That's a Franklin Mint piece. Eight dollars.
MRS. ACKERMAN: Eight dollars?! Franklin Mint or not, it's damaged goods!
MRS. ACKERMAN: I'll take this instead.
VENDOR: Nice one, huh? Winter's coming. Three dollars?... I guess that's what I marked it...
MOM: Did you find your Franklin Mint egg, Rosemary darling?
MRS. ACKERMAN: I saw one, but it was ridiculously overpriced!
MOM: You want me to keep that under the table for you?
MRS. ACKERMAN: If you wouldn't mind... It was on sale.
