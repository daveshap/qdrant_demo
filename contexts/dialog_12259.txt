HAROLD: ... which I hope will make you very happy.
MAUDE: Oh, I am happy, Harold. Ecstatically happy. I couldn't imagine a lovelier farewell.
HAROLD: Farewell?
MAUDE: Why yes. It's my eightieth birthday.
HAROLD: But you're not going anywhere, are you?
MAUDE: Oh yes, dear. I took the pills an hour ago. I should be gone by midnight.
MAUDE: Oh, Harold! What a fuss this is. So unnecessary.
HAROLD: Maude, please. Don't die. I couldn't bear it. Please, don't die.
MAUDE: But, Harold, we begin to die as soon as we are born. What is so strange about death? It's no surprise. It's part of life. It's change.
HAROLD: But why now?
MAUDE: I thought eighty was a good round number.
MAUDE: I feel giddy.
HAROLD: But Maude, you don't understand. I love you. Do you hear me? I've never said that to anyone in my life before. You're the first. Maude. Please don't leave me.
MAUDE: Oh, Harold, don't upset yourself so.
HAROLD: It's true. I can't live without you.
MAUDE: And this too shall pass away.""
HAROLD: Never! Never! I'll never forget you. I wanted to marry you. Don't you understand! I love you. I love you!
MAUDE: Oh! That's wonderful, Harold. Go - and love some more.
