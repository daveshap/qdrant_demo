SPECIAL AGENT STERLING: Quite a night, Inspector. Ricky Tan was our only bait, and now he's gone. You finally got your revenge - at the expense of a U.S. Government investigation.
CARTER: What revenge" is he talking about?"
SPECIAL AGENT STERLING: I don't know if the Fu-Cang-Long paid you to get rid of Tan, or whether it was a pure vendetta killing -- but you're off this case. I don't ever want to see you again, you got that?
CARTER: Hey, you, Secret Service Man, what are you --
SPECIAL AGENT STERLING: Stay out of it, Carter. You're going back to L.A.
CARTER: Fine with me.
