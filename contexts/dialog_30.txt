PATRICK: What plan?
MICHAEL: The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.
PATRICK: What is it with this chick? She have three tits?
MICHAEL: I think I speak correctly when I say that Cameron's love is pure. Purer than say -- Joey Dorsey's.
PATRICK: Dorsey can plow whoever he wants. I'm just in this for the cash.
MICHAEL: That's where we can help you. With Kat.
PATRICK: So Dorsey can get the girl?
MICHAEL: Patrick, Pat, you're not looking at the big picture. Joey's just a pawn. We set this whole thing up so Cameron can get the girl.
PATRICK: You two are gonna help me tame the wild beast?
MICHAEL: We're your guys.
CAMERON: And he means that strictly in a non- prison-movie type of way.
PATRICK: Yeah -- we'll see.
