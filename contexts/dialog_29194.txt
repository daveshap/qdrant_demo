VIPER: Twenty years' experience, I couldn't shake you. You may be a great flyer. I mean that.
MAVERICK: I lost.
VIPER: Of course you did. I said a great flyer, not a smart one. You fly reckless. Great instincts. No discipline. That ambush today, you followed your emotions instead of your wingman. Of course you got killed...and well deserved to. It was a really stupid mistake. In battle, it gets people killed.
MAVERICK: I can take care of myself.
VIPER: Talent is no holy shield. Von Richtofen was killed by a farm boy. Instincts are not enough. Do it our way. We've worked these things out. The good pilots can become better and the great ones can learn how to stay alive. Why do you have to do everything the hard way?
MAVERICK: It's my own way. It works for me. I don't care about the rest of that stuff.
VIPER: Then why are you here?
MAVERICK: For the same reason you are.
VIPER: Oh, you mean the thrill!
MAVERICK: The flying. The fighting. I'd go up there ten times a day to fight. I'd win at least nine of them. That's all I want to do. It's what I do best. I am real good. Just give me the jet.
