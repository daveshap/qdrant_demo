How do the United States' current laws related to mental illness and firearms function in practice?
As per Wikipedia, [The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brady_Handgun_Violence_Prevention_Act) prohibits anyone who "has been adjudicated as a mental defective or committed to a mental institution" from "shipping or transporting any firearm in interstate or foreign commerce, or receiving any firearm which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce, or possessing any firearm in or affecting commerce"

Also, a [helpful NY Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/01/06/us/how-people-with-mental-illness-are-able-to-obtain-guns.html) states that " individuals cannot buy a gun if a court or other authority has deemed them a “mental defective” or committed them involuntarily to a mental hospital." 

My questions are
1: Who all is affected by this?
2: What all are those affected by this legislation restricted from doing?

Under question 1, I'll add the following 
A: Is this a lifetime ban? 
B: Does it include those who were involuntarily committed before the bill was passed?
C: Are minors treated differently, or would a person involuntarily committed as a minor be affected?
D: Can fully rehabilitated individuals become unaffected through any process? 

And under question 2, I'll add
A: Does this prevent affected individuals from buying guns in private sales? (That is, would they be punished for doing so?)

The alphabetized questions are mainly suggestions; they're not necessary to answer but they're things to consider in answering (and if you can answer them specifically, that's great too!)
