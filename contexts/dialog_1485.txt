ELIZABETH: Why would I?
ELIZABETH: This tastes weird. Harley? It's me. I need your services. Translate that anyway you'd like. I'm at-
BATEMAN: You're at Paul Owen s.
ELIZABETH: Who?
BATEMAN: Paul Owen.
ELIZABETH: I want the number, idiot. Anyway, I'm at Paul Norman's and I'll try you later and if I don't see you at Canal Bar tomorrow night I'm going to sic my hairdresser on you.
ELIZABETH: Did you know that guy who disappeared? Didn't he work at Pierce & Pierce, too? Was he a friend of yours?
BATEMAN: No.
ELIZABETH: Do you have any coke? Or Halcyon? I'd take a Halcyon.
BATEMAN: Listen, I would just like to see...the two of you...get it on. What's wrong with that? It's totally disease-free.
ELIZABETH: Patrick, you re a lunatic.
BATEMAN: Come on. Don't you find Christie attractive?
ELIZABETH: Let's not get lewd. I'm in no mood to have a lewd conversation.
BATEMAN: Come on. I think it would be a turn-on.
ELIZABETH: Does he do this all the time?
