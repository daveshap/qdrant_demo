Accessing internet on a MacBook Air through iPhone's access to Wi-Fi, rather than its access to cellular data Is it possible to do something similar to iPhone hotspot, but instead of using the iPhone's cellular data connection, it uses it's Wi-Fi connection instead. Thus, allowing a MacBook Air to access the hotspot in order to use the internet through the iPhone's Wi-Fi connection instead of its cellular connection.I would like to try this because my MacBook Air's Wi-Fi connection is flaky, but when connecting it to my iPhone's hotspot it seems to be fine.
