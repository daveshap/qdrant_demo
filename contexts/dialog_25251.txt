SCOTTY: They're giving out. De-crystallizing.
KIRK: Give me a round figure, Mr. Scott.
SCOTTY: Oh, twenty-four hours, give or take, staying cloaked. After that, Admiral, we'll be visible -- and dead in the water. In any case, we won't have enough to break out of the Earth's gravity, to say nothing of getting back home.
KIRK: I can't believe we've come this far only to be stopped by this! Scotty, is there any way dilithium can be re-crystallized?
SCOTTY: Sorry, sir. We can't even do that in the 23rd Century.
SPOCK: There is a 20th Century possibility.
KIRK: Explain.
SPOCK: If memory serves, there was a dubious flirtation with nuclear fission reactors resulting in toxic side effects. By the beginning of the fusion era, these reactors had been replaced, but at this time, we should be able to find some.
KIRK: But you said toxic.
SPOCK: We could rig a device to collect their high energy photons safely; we could then inject the photons into the dilithium chamber, causing crystalline restructure.... Theoretically.
KIRK: Where would we find these reactors... Theoretically.
SPOCK: Nuclear power was widely used in naval vessels...
BONES: It doesn't look all that different.
KIRK: Let's hope so, Bones. Mr. Sulu, set us down in Golden Gate Park.
SULU: Aye, sir. Descending.
KIRK: We'll divide into teams. Commanders Chekov and Uhura are assigned to the Uranium problem.
CHEKOV: Yes, sir.
KIRK: Dr. McCoy, you, Mr. Scott and Commander Sulu will convert us a whale tank.
BONES: Oh, joy.
KIRK: Captain Spock and I will attempt to trace these whale songs to their source.
UHURA: I'll have bearing and distance for you, sir.
KIRK: Right. Now look: I want you all to be very careful. This is terra incognita. Many customs will doubtless take us by surprise. It's a forgone conclusion these people have never seen an extra-terrestrial before.
