Why do companies even bother hiring an “unproven worker”?
I just thought about this. If you own a company and you knew you needed to do 10-12 critical things every year to secure revenue, why would you even bother hiring someone from auxiliary fields or straight out of college? Why not always hire someone who has dealt as closely as possible with your exact problems or hire outside firms? Why risk investing in a workforce? By this meta, only grown chickens should get jobs, but obviously people are still hiring baby eggs. I want perspectives from the bosses here. Why do you “invest” in a workforce instead of buying off the shelf? Why/when does that strategy work best for your company and industry?
