APOLLO: ...That man's takin' his job too serious.
TRAINER: He's movin' to your left -- don't let him no more -- dance and stick, hear? Don't play -- I know what ya feelin', but don't play.
APOLLO: He got lucky.
TRAINER: Luck! You fightin' a crazy man -- but you got him hurt bad. More ice, now!
MICKEY: How you holdin' up, kid?
ROCKY: Fine... That guy's great.
MICKEY: Gimme the water! Ya gettin' tagged with his right. I think you should feint left and high hook 'im -- Benny, check the eyes! Can ya see?
ROCKY: See what?
MIKE: Ya sappin' his strength -- He's losin' steam.
ROCKY: He ain't losin' nothin'.
