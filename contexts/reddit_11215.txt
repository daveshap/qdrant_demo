i don’t ever want to have children; but my family doesn’t want to hear it
so let me start at the beginning. i’m 25 right now and i’m currently studying to be a private investigator. but when i graduate at 27, in my culture, i’m expected to find a career, and then a husband, and then have children after a few years of marriage.  

but here is the thing: i never, and i mean NEVER want to go through having children. i hate the sound of babies crying,  (i have Misophonia) every time i see a new mother they look like death, and i have mental illness and i could never forgive myself if i were to pass that on to my “offspring”. it’s hard cause it’s not just my family too, it’s my friends, and i remember when my mom and i were at Leon’s (you know, the furniture store) a few years ago and i mentioned this to which the clerk said: “oh she’s young, she’ll change her mind.”  

i have considered stabbing myself in the uterus multiple times in my life, getting tubal litigation but i was rejected cause i was too young and never wanted children and now it’s gotten to the point that every time i even think about pregnancy i feel like i want to kill myself. i’ve struggled with suicidal tendencies for most of my teenage and adult life, and this is triggering it again. i know i have tokophobia, and i’ve known i don’t want children ever since i was 9 years old.
