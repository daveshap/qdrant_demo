STACY: Thanks for getting rid of those flowers.
BRAD: Don't worry about it. Who sent the flowers?
STACY: It's just some guy I met at Swenson's. You don't know him.
BRAD: I don't care it you tell me or not. I got problems of my own.
STACY: Is everything okay at work?
BRAD: Are you kidding? Work is great. I kill at work. I don't even mind Mom and Dad making me pay rent.
STACY: You're going to break up with Lisa, aren't you?
BRAD: I've been doing some thinking. It's my last school year. I'm a single, successful guy. I think I want my freedom.
STACY: Why? Because she won't sleep with you?
BRAD: Where did you hear that?
STACY: I'm just guessing.
BRAD: Well... it's true.
STACY: Maybe you just need to give her some time. She's so nice, Brad. Everybody loves Lisa.
BRAD: Everybody loves Lisa. Everybody loves Lisa. But everybody doesn't have to be her boyfriend.
STACY: Hey, Brad. Are you still a virgin?
BRAD: Why?
STACY: I don't know. I was just curious.
BRAD: Maybe yes. Maybe no.
STACY: You are a virgin!
BRAD: I didn't say that.
STACY: But your face did!
BRAD: Are you still a virgin?
STACY: Maybe yes. Maybe no.
BRAD: Don't give me that shit! I know you're still a virgin!
STACY: There... There's his car. I know he's at work tonight. He hasn't come into Swenson's since he called my house. My mother told him I was still at high school, after I told him I was nineteen. I guess I should tell him I'm fifteen.
LINDA: Don't you dare, you'll never hear from him again.
STACY: Does Doug care that you're seventeen?
LINDA: Doug sees beyond that stuff to what the person inside is like. That's why I'm marrying him.
STACY: If he ever calls again I'll say I'm eighteen.
LINDA: Boy I am so glad to be through with all these games.
