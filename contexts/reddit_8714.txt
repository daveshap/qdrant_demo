Questions about troops and militia on the Mexican border.
Based on numerous news reports, (sources for National Guard) [1](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/10/29/migrant-caravan-troops-border/1805864002/) [2](https://www.vox.com/2018/10/29/18026646/military-border-caravan-immigrants-trump-caravan) (sources for Militias) [3](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-border-militia-caravan-20181026-story.html) [4](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/migrant-caravan-us-armed-militia-groups-mexico-texas-border-trump-immigration-a8604371.html), both the National Guard and militia members are planning to guard the border.

[Posse comitatus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posse_Comitatus_Act) would seem to make using USNG like this illegal. What can a large body of troops do on the border?

If an militia member touches someone crossing the border, is it assault? If the militia man crosses the border and injures someone, then is he not in violation of Mexican law? Would the USNG have to detain the person responsible?
