I finally submitted my first draft of my dissertation!!
This is huge for me, I have been procrastinating about writing my master's dissertation for the past few weeks and the pandemic lockdown situation was not helping my case either. I was getting stuck in the cycle of wanting to send something perfect because I now have so much time to research and write. This just led to more procrastination and self-criticism of my work. I wasn't moving forward.

But I finally got my act together and compiled whatever I have done till now and sent it to my supervisor for remarks. I really needed a second opinion on what I was doing. I feel really good about sending something, even if it was not my best work. It feels like progress.

I hope everyone on this thread is doing well and doing their best to cope with life. I don't know when I will graduate and what the job market will be after this lol. This dissertation is the only thing going on for me right now.
