Horrid Job Search Experience anyone?
Recently had a horrible time finding a new job. Can anyone else relate to this?

I have over cumulative 15 years of sales and sales management experience. I had been looking to switch industries and began searching on all the typical job avenues i.e LinkedIn, monster, career builder, zip recruiter, directly on companies website. 

I was shocked to see how dehumanizing the whole process was. 

You see, prior to me thinking about switching industries, all my previous jobs were obtained by referral. Those interviews typically were 1 day interviews with the job offer presented within 3 business days. 

But WOW, what a wake up call, the job search grind was REAL!  The time wasting  waiting to hear anything back became the norm. I’ve had 2 emails from companies, the first auto response where they acknowledge you’ve applied and the second email comes in 3 months later also an auto response saying how they chose someone better than you. 


Anyone else have a similar experience finding a job?
