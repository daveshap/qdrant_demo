MOSS: Yes.
AARONOW: I...
MOSS: It's not something for nothing, George, I took you in on this, you have to go. That's your thing. I've made the deal with Graff. I can't go. I can't go in, I've spoken on this too much. I've got a big mouth. The fucking leads" et cetera
AARONOW: They'll know when you go over to Graff...
MOSS: What will they know? That I stole the leads? I didn't steal the leads, I'm going to the movies tonight with a friend, and then I'm going to the Como Inn. Why did I go to Graff? I got a better deal. Period. Let 'em prove something. They can't prove anything that's not the case.
AARONOW: Dave.
MOSS: Yes.
AARONOW: You want me to break into the office tonight and steal the leads?
MOSS: Yes.
