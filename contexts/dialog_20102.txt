SID: By the way, shouldn't you have had a period by now?
LYNETTE: I'm a little late, that's all.
SID: How late?
LYNETTE: What difference does it make? If anything was to happen, which I'm sure it isn't, it would be my responsibility.
SID: Exactly how late are you, Lynette?
LYNETTE: What do you care? Suppose I was pregnant. Just suppose it. You don't think I'd try to make you do anything you don't want to, do you?
SID: No. But that's not the only issue here, sweetheart. There's a lot more to it than that.
LYNETTE: What other issue is there, Sid?
SID: My responsibility as its father, for one. I mean, if I've made you pregnant, I'd want to... do the right thing.
SID: ...I'd want to pay for the abortion... I'd want to be with you through the whole thing... by your side. So how late are you, Lynette?
LYNETTE: Let's just wait and see what happens.
