The classical electrodynamic atom What methods have been used to rigorously prove that classical electrodynamics does not admit a robustly stable atom? The conclusion is often stated and I am aware of the standard responses such as the sub-second collapse of the classical version of the Bohr atom. I am also aware of static stable configurations that are not stable under perturbations (the robust condition). This question is asking about broader techniques and techniques that are rigorous and not approximations. It is not a question about quantum mechanics and I have a moderately strong academic background in theoretical mechanics.
