Stuck in the house with my rapist.
As title says. Lockdown has me stuck 24/7 in the same house as my brother, who raped me over the course of 3 years when I was a kid. Usually I have work, friends, boyfriend, places to go, things to do that keep me away from here as least some of the time. But all I hear when I wake up and when I go to sleep is his laughter, laughter that should have been mine. He's disabled, so everyone ignores what he did, as if it somehow means it doesn't hurt me because "he wasn't *trying* to hurt you." But he DID. I look back at my life and wonder just how much he took from me and how much more he will continue to take. What's the point in continuing on if I'm just going to lose so much before it even has a chance to happen? I'll never marry, because I'll never be able to find someone willing and able to suffer through my mood swings, my depression, my complete lack of emotional control. I'm already 99% sure my bf is readying himself to end it. I'll never achieve my dreams because I lack the drive to do anything constructive for myself. I'll keep pushing people away because I'm so afraid they'll hurt me. What's the point in living in a world where people want you so little, they'll defend and protect your rapist? All I ever wanted was someone to come along who would be angry for me. Who would show me that this was not what I deserved and introduce me to peace and maybe justice. But all anyone has ever done is pull a curtain over it and tell me not to look. But it's there, it's always there and it always will be. People always tell us assault victims that we're "survivors" but I don't want to "survive". I want to live. But I don't think I ever will.
