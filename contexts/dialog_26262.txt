GILLIS: Not on the same floor with Valentino!
NORMA: Just follow me.
NORMA: Don't bend back like that.
GILLIS: It's those feathers. They tickle.
GILLIS: It's a quarter past ten. What time are they supposed to get here?
NORMA: Who?
GILLIS: The other guests?
NORMA: There are no other guests. We don't want to share this night with other people. This is for you and me.
GILLIS: I understand some rich guy bought up all the tickets for a perfor- mance at the Metropolitan and sat there listening to La Traviata, all by himself. He was afraid of catching cold.
NORMA: Hold me tighter.
GILLIS: Come midnight, how about blind- folding the orchestra and smash- ing champagne glasses on Max's head?
NORMA: You think this is all very funny.
GILLIS: A little.
NORMA: Is it funny that I'm in love with you?
GILLIS: What's that?
NORMA: I'm in love with you. Don't you know that? I've been in love with you all along.
