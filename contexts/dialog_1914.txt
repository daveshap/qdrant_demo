LIEUTENANT: Captain Willard?
WILLARD: That's me.
LIEUTENANT: Captain Willard -- we got these from Nha Thrang two days ago -- they expected you here then --
LIEUTENANT: You don't know how happy that makes me, sir.
WILLARD: Why?
LIEUTENANT: Now I can get out a here -- if I can find a way out.
WILLARD: We'll be needing some supplies and fuel -- do you know anybody who can give me a hand?
LIEUTENANT: I'd just clear out as soon as I could if I were you, sir. They're gonna start working on the bridge with torches again. Charlie will start throwing it in hard --
WILLARD: What is this bridge?
LIEUTENANT: It's of strategic importance for keeping the highway into Bat Shan open -- the generals don't like to admit that Bat Shan is surrounded.
