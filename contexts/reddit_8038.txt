Housing
Hello,
I'll be moving to Lafayette, Indiana for my doctorate degree. I'll be renting an apartment for the first year but its seems due to limited availability I'll be moving in to apartments that do not provide good service and take away deposits for "cleaning" when vacated.

Seeing that I'll be new to a country - USA, I'd like to know what to look out for and not to screw myself over from these people. 

Please advise on:
1. What to look for in lease agreement
2. What to do if the equipments and service mentioned do not function and are not repaired when asked
3. How to claim the deposit back without it being taken away.

Thanks.
