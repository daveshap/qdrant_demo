Determining the correct usage of \"reminds\" vs \"remind\" In the following sentence:<blockquote>  We celebrate all the shapes, colors, texture, and fun that remind us of what it was like to be a kid.</blockquote>Should it be remind us or reminds us? I'm pretty sure it should be \"remind\simply because there are multiple things that are reminding us. But wife claims otherwise, so need to settle this! The fact that the enumeration ends with the word fun is I guess the point of contention.It probably also should be textures instead of texture, but that may be a different argument.
