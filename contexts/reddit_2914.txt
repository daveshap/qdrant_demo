How to find a job that you really enjoy without focusing on money?
So, every job I look at I’m focused on how much money I’ll be making rather than if I can do that job or if I’ll like it. While I would love to make a lot of money, I believe my true focus right now should be figuring out what I even like. How were you guys able to find something you like and enjoyed regardless of money?
