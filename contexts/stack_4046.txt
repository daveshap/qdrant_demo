10-hour layover in Nairobi (NBO) I am flying on a Canadian passport to JRO via NBO and I have TWO separate itineraries. The first flight gets me to NBO via Lufthansa at 8:40pm and then the second flight departs NBO via Kenya Airways at 7:30am.It seems I need to pick up my bags and recheck. Will I need a Kenyan transit visa for this?Thanks.
