please help me i’m freaking out!!!
i got my phone taken away the other day at school and my background was me and my friends smoking and drinking and my teacher saw it and told the principal. they called my mom (witch was okay) but now the school is talking about getting my license taken away. the picture was a year ago and i’m 17 years old and i make a’s and b’s. can they take my license away?
