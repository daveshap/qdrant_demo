Always late for work
I’ve been consistently late for work by about 15 minutes the past couple of weeks. My boss has noticed and asked if I’m happy in my current position. I told him I was fine and would do better to be on time. 

Every morning is a struggle to get out of bed. Every morning is a challenge, and by running late it snowballs into a stressful and triggering day. All I want to do is stay in bed and sleep. 

How do you force yourself to get out of bed? How do you deal with tardiness?
