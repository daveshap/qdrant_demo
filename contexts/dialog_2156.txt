DOUG: Have you cleared all the rubble up?
CHRIS: No, not yet.
DOUG: You're all bloody useless.
JAHN: Hi, want to take up dancing?
DOUG: Later. Jahn, I've been let down by the guys who were going to do the flooring. They brought the materials but took my money and ran. You guys have a school theatre don't you?
JAHN: Yes, The Obelisk but it's closed for repairs.
DOUG: So I hear, do you know some of the stage hands?
JAHN: Sure, they are students.
DOUG: Well, I want them to put down a floor and a walkway.
