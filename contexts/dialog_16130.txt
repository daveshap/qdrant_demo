SAM: Oh, so you're in the big shit now! Child abuse. People go to prison for what you just did to me.
GEORGE: My dad used to play a game. I never really understood what it was until after he was gone.
SAM: I was holding for someone. That wasn't even mine.
GEORGE: The game was to make me smaller than he was. No matter what. He could be almost invisible as a human being, but I had to be smaller. So if I got good grades, I was a pussy for not playing football. If I cut my hair for him, it wasn't short enough. If I shaved it, I looked like a psycho. I never won the game. Not once. And if he couldn't make me smaller with words...
SAM: I'll have to pay him back.
GEORGE: I won't ever hit you. I don't want you smaller. I want you to be happy. You're not. Not here with me. Not home with your mother. Not up in Tahoe. Not alone. Not anywhere. You're what I was most of my life, Sam. I see it in your eyes. In your sleep. In your answer to everything. You're barely alive.
SAM: I'm not even listening.
GEORGE: You know that great thing, though? Is that change can be so constant you don't even feel the difference until there is one. It can be so slow that you don't even notice that your life is better or worse, until it is. Or it can just blow you away. Make you something different in an instant. It happened to me.
