Double Major?
I’m considering adding a second masters degree to my course of study. I’m currently in a masters program for clinical mental health counseling, but my school offers a dual degree program where I could graduate with a second masters in marriage and family counseling. It would add a second internship as well as additional courses to my course of study. Has anyone done this?
