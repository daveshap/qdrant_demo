SERAFINE: Andy?... What? What is it? Andy... are you okay?
ANDY: It was you... That night in the tunnels. You. You did this to me.
SERAFINE: No I.... Andy, you can't be sure.
ANDY: That's the scar where I stabbed you! Oh God... You deliberately took me down there so you could... God, I can't believe it!
SERAFINE: You made me go there. I tried to stop you! You wouldn't listen!
ANDY: What was I? Your idea of a fuckin' hors d'oeuvre? Huh?
SERAFINE: Shut up! You fucking shut up! What do you want? Huh? What the hell do you want?
SERAFINE: Here! Come on! Do it! Go ahead.
ANDY: What...?
SERAFINE: You know what. Kill me. Cut out my fucking heart. Go on! Do it!
