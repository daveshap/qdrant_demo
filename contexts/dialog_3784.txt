BLADE: Get in. Youâ€™re leaving.
WHISTLER: Wait.
WHISTLER: Consider it a parting gift. Vampire mace -- silver nitrate, essence of garlic.
KAREN: So that's it? You guys just patch me up and send me on my way?
WHISTLER: There is one other thing. I'd buy yourself a gun if I were you. If you start becoming sensitive to the daylight, if you start becoming thirsty regardless of much you've had to drink -- then I suggest you take that gun and use it on yourself. Better that, than the alternative.
