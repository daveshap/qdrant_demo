Here is a source from The Washington Post that the GOP link to which reaffirms their $32 trillion claim:

"The $32 trillion refers to H.R. 676, a Medicare-for-all bill sponsored every year by Rep. John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.); the cost estimate comes from a study by the Urban Institute. For the first time, most House Democrats have endorsed the bill, and many can explain how a single-payer system would end up saving money."

They also link to NPR, who again reaffirm the $32 trillion claim:

"The Health Policy Center (like TPC, a project of the Urban Institute, a D.C. think tank) estimated that Sanders' health proposal would cost the government an additional $32 trillion to what it pays now."
