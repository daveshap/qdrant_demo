How to handle a structural break in VAR model? I want to construct a VAR model of three time series: Inflation, GDP growth and Unemployment from 1963 to 2018. I have found a structural break around the year 2007 (2007-2008 financial crisis). I do not want to estimate two different VAR models, i.e. one for the crisis and one after the crisis. I am considering using a dummy variable for the crisis as an exogeneous variable to solve the problem, but I do not like this particular solution. Does anyone know how I could build my model such that the structural break is incorporated?
