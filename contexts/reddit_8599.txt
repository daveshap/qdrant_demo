How do the campaign finance violations to which Michael Cohen pleaded guilty today compare to violations by past campaigns?
[Today, Michael Cohen, President Trump's former personal attorney entered a guilty plea related to tax and campaign finance charges.  As the New York Times describes:](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/21/nyregion/michael-cohen-plea-deal-trump.html?smid=fb-nytimes&smtyp=cur)

>Michael D. Cohen, President Trump’s former fixer, made the extraordinary admission in court on Tuesday that Mr. Trump had directed him to arrange payments to two women during the 2016 campaign to keep them from speaking publicly about affairs they said they had with Mr. Trump.

>Mr. Cohen acknowledged the illegal payments while pleading guilty to breaking campaign finance laws and other charges. He told a judge in United States District Court in Manhattan that the payments to the women were made “in coordination with and at the direction of a candidate for federal office.”



I was wondering how this compares to past campaign finance issues Presidents and candidates have had.  In particular, I found [this article](https://www.politico.com/story/2013/01/obama-2008-campaign-fined-375000-085784) and [this article](https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2013/01/07/obama-campaign-fined-big-for-hiding-donors-keeping-illegal-donations) about excess donations to the Obama campaign in 2012, and wanted to know what was similar or different about that case, or other past cases like this?
