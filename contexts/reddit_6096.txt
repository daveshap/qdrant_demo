Laid off, hiring freezes, job leads drying up, visa pressure, ghosted by recruiters, how should I move forward？
Here’s my backstory: After graduating in May 2019 with a BFA in graphic design, I have been on the job search for 6 months. After 6 months of hard work and frustration, I have accepted my previous position back in January, and have been working diligently that my supervisor and my boss are giving me positive reviews. I was going to file my OPT STEM extension on April, but one day during mid-March, I was being called into the boss‘ room at the end of the day, and being told that we were being laid off due to the Coronavirus pandemic seeing our clients cancelling the events. Before I go, he told me verbally that the company would rehire me after the pandemic‘s over. 

Since then I have been back on the job search again. Now, before you comment “Just get a job at the grocery store bro!”, let me remind you that *OPT VISAS ARE ONLY ALLOWED TO WORK ON WHATEVER IT’S RELATED TO THEIR MAJORS OF STUDY*. So that means other than freelancing on the sideline, I can’t just apply to any jobs because this would violate my visa conditions, but again, those are drying up as well. As I apply to positions left and right, I have been contacted by recruiters who clearly expresses their interest, but then completely ghosted me after I replied to express my interest or just get flat out rejected. Now as I barely keeping my OPT status active, I don’t know how to move forward with the job search, as most companies have frozen hiring or laying off people, and my visa status will expire on July with no idea when my former boss will call me back, is there anyway to move forward in this trying times?
