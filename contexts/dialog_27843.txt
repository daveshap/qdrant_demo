CLEMENZA: You heard about your father?
SONNY: Yeah.
CLEMENZA: The word is out in the streets that he's dead.
SONNY: Where the hell was Paulie, why wasn't he with the Don?
CLEMENZA: Paulie's been a little sick all winter...he was home.
SONNY: How many times did he stay home the last couple of months?
CLEMENZA: Maybe three, four times. I always asked Freddie if he wanted another bodyguard, but he said no. Things have been so smooth the last ten years...
SONNY: Go get Paulie, I don't care how sick he is. Pick him up yourself, and bring him to my father's house.
CLEMENZA: That's all? Don't you want me to send some people over here?
SONNY: No, just you and Paulie.
