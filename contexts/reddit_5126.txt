Turned down because of too high salary expectation. No discussion to be had at all. Is this normal?
So a potential employer had strung me along for months. They seemed interested in my application but were very sparse shall we say with their communication. They would respond in 2-3 week intervals and always no more than two sentences and there was talk of an interview at some point which never came to light. So yeah not good signs obviously. Finally they ask what my salary expectations are and I respond with what I thought was a very reasonable amount. A week later they respond and quite bluntly turn me down because my salary expectation was too high. This was for a company in a far away country so the standards might be different - fair enough. I expressed that I did not know what the salary standards are over there and what amount they would be comfortable with then. They do not seem to want to talk about it whatsoever.

I am really irked by this because I find it such a trivial reason (and not a smart business practice) to turn someone down. Now mind you If they had said we're willing you pay you this much instead and I had then tried to negotiate further then sure I would understand it. But to not even hear what the expectations were on their side I find just unfair.

Admittedly I partially write this here as a means to vent but also I would like to know if this is normal practice within the hiring process and perhaps what is, if there is one, the deeper reasoning for it?
