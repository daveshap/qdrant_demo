ALEXANDER: With respect, sir, would we have the telegraph without fantasy? Would we have radium and X-rays without someone first dreaming we could?
DEAN FULTON: The advances you speak of were the result of countless years of study and empirical experimentation, a careful evolutionary process, not chalkboard parlor-tricks.
ALEXANDER: My equations are not parlor-tricks!
DEAN FULTON: Abstract mathematics, relativity of dimensions, geometrical durations" -- even allowing for the uses of speculation
ALEXANDER: Because it's a new way of seeing the world! Of seeing our place in it!
PHILBY: Sir, if I may --
DEAN FULTON: Young man, we have a way of doing things here. Radical theorizing is not acceptable. Have I made myself understood?
ALEXANDER: Yes, sir.
DEAN FULTON: Very good. Now if you will excuse us for a moment.
PHILBY: If I might explain, sir --
DEAN FULTON: You supported his application, Dr. Philby. You are his senior, advisor. I depend upon you to restrain his... excesses. Any repetition of the behavior I witnessed in his classroom today and there will be consequences for you both.
PHILBY: Yes, sir.
DEAN FULTON: Now you are upsetting my fowl. Please go.
