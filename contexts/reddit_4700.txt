Help with Negative Self Talk
I just started therapy and this came up. Even trying to talk about how poorly I view myself makes me cry. I get more embarrassed and want to run. I have anxiety as well and have to somehow return to therapy each week. Anyway, I am struggling to turn off this negative self talk. I know I need to replace it but am not doing that too well. I have a parent who directly impacted the way I view myself and have tried to distance myself from them since learning about my issues with the therapist. Aside from cutting off that source of judgement and negativity, what else can I do to work on this? What have you done to help shift your mindset. Are there any books youâ€™d recommend? Or activities I can try?
