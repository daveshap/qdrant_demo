SCHAEFER: It was all bullshit. All of it. From the start... you set us up, got us in here to do your dirty work.
DILLON: That's right, I set you up. You're a veteran at this, Dutch, I had to.
SCHAEFER: Why us?
DILLON: Because I told you, you're the best. I knew you could do it but I couldn't get you in here without a cover story.
SCHAEFER: What story did you give to Davis?
DILLON: We've been lookin' for this place for months. The chopper must have gotten close when they got shot down. Hopper was sent in to get my men. He was just doing his job. When he disappeared I had to clean this up, I had to stop there bastards. We were so close, we couldn't quit. We couldn't sleep through this one. I needed you, Dutch, can't you see that?
