Which is the most accurate temperature sensor in the market? I have been working on a project requiring very accurate and precise measurements of temperature, of the order of +-0.1 degrees Celcius (or the closest to this), I have been using a LM-35 and as expected, the results weren't great, specially horrible for my application. Can anyone suggest me any good temperature sensor, I was thinking about the Bosch BME-280, but later learnt it is primarily for humidity and pressure measurements and might not be accurate enough for my application.I have also tried DHT11/22 series, but it was worthless too.I have not tried ds18b20 yet, is it recommended?Edit 1: The measurement is to be made in the range of 36.5-37.5 degrees Celsius, accuracy of the order of +-0.1 degrees Celcius is desired.Edit 2: I know basic programming with Arduino, but have never calibrated a sensor before.
