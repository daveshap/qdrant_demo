ARNIE: That was a stupid thing you did. Incredibly stupid.
HELENA: I tried, Arnie. And, I will continue to try.
ARNIE: Have you gone crazy? You are not Carl. You aren't as good as Carl. They are moving the trial to a high security location. The press has gone berserk. The jury will be influenced. Stay out of things. Let us try to win the case.
HELENA: That is going to be rather difficult when all the evidence is against us.
ARNIE: Helena, please. This is out of your hands.
HELENA: I know I made things worse. I know that and I'm sorry, but Arnie I need something from you. Something only you can help me with.
ARNIE: Helena --
HELENA: I need an introduction to the Obregon Brothers.
ARNIE: I can't do that.
