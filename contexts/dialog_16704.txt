RICKY: Did Max mention anything about any jobs?
BOBBY: What about boxing?
RICKY: What about it?
BOBBY: What are you saying?
RICKY: You said if you didn't have a winning record after eleven fights, you'd talk to Max.
BOBBY: So?
RICKY: So, it was a draw.
BOBBY: Yeah, I'm 5-5 and 1.
RICKY: So, it's not a winning record.
BOBBY: It's not losing record.
RICKY: That's not what you said. You said if you didn't have a winning record --
BOBBY: Don't be shitty.
RICKY: How am I being shitty?
BOBBY: Don't be shitty.
RICKY: I wouldn't keep bugging you, but you said he said he would have a job for us.
BOBBY: I'm not gonna bring it up to him.
RICKY: Of course I don't want you to bring it up to him... But if it comes up...
BOBBY: I'll page you.
RICKY: Yeah. Page me. You know the number?
BOBBY: Yeah. I know the number.
RICKY: Cause if you don't know the number, I can page you with the number so you'll have the number.
BOBBY: I know the number.
RICKY: I'll page you with the number. I'll see you later. What time you done?
BOBBY: I got no idea.
RICKY: Ask if he said anything to her.
BOBBY: I will.
RICKY: I'll page you with the number.
BOBBY: Bye.
BOBBY: Honey?
JESS: Where were you?
BOBBY: So, what kind of gig is this?
JESS: Easy night. Bachelor party. Can we give Wendy a ride?
BOBBY: No. What kind of bachelor party?
JESS: The easy kind. They're young and rich and well mannered.
JESS: Oh my god. What happened?
BOBBY: A draw. What makes you think they're well mannered?
JESS: Bobby, this is a plumb gig. It's a bunch of young agents and it's at a restaurant. It's gonna be easy and we'll make a lot of money.
BOBBY: I don't like you working with Wendy. Why are you working with Wendy?
JESS: They requested her. It was her gig. Max put me on as a favor.
BOBBY: Some favor. I hope they know you're not like Wendy.
JESS: Oh, please.
BOBBY: If they asked for her, they're probably expecting blowjobs all around.
JESS: Will you cut it out! Get ready, we're already late.
BOBBY: Who's watching the baby?
JESS: She's downstairs with Ruth. Get ready.
BOBBY: I'm ready.
JESS: Bullshit. These are classy customers. You can't show up all fucked up with a Fila running suit on.
BOBBY: They're not too classy to have tits rubbed in their face.
