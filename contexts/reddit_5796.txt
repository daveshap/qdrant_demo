Qualified for unemployment but I make too much?
Sorry for the long post, I felt the information was necessary to understand what's going on. 


So, I filed for unemployment because my job has cut my hours quite significantly (was working anywhere from 39-45 hours a week and now I'm at 24-27 hours a week). 

I filed about a little over two weeks ago. I got a letter in the mail saying I qualified for a certain amount based on the I formation I told them. 
Long story short, I got off the phone with two different people from the unemployment office and they said I make too much money. 
They said I'm qualified but I need to lose more hours. What I don't understand is I've talked to three people prior, at the unemployment office, and they've never mentioned I wouldn't get paid. Also, why in the world would I even get a letter in the mail saying I qualified then get told I make too much?

It's very frustrating. They said I need to make $170 a week to qualify and another person told me I need to make $100 a week to qualify. 
While my mother, a few years back, worked more hours and made more than me. They paid her the difference on the work she missed throughout the week. Did the laws change recently or am I just getting screwed over?
