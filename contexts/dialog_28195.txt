GILLES: This is no good!
LA HIRE: No good? This is a disaster!
GILLES: Jeanne... The men are exhausted!
JEANNE: I know, but so is the enemy -- they're falling back -- Paris is ours...!
GILLES: Jeanne... we're not enough...
JEANNE: So... bring up the reinforcements!
GILLES: Reinforcements? Where??
JEANNE: Right behind us -- Dunois with another then thousand men!
GILLES: Jeanne, look behind you.
JEANNE: Never look behind -- only ahead!
GILLES: Do you know how to count?
JEANNE: Of course I do? Bring them up!
GILLES: Jeanne... that is not ten thousand reinforcements -- that is one hundred very loyal but very tired soldiers.
JEANNE: But... where is Dunois... where are the men the king promised me?
GILLES: He never sent them... Don't you understand? He doesn't want this war anymore... he has his crown now, that's all he ever wanted...
JEANNE: But my voices... they promised me...
GILLES: To hell with your voices -- it's time to face facts! We have nothing to do here... none of us... not even you. You should go home, Jeanne.
JEANNE: You don't believe me anymore?
LA HIRE: We still believe in you, Jeanne. If it were up to me, I'd chase every goddamn Englishman into the ocean. But it's not up to us anymore -- it's up to the king...
