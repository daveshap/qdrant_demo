The Generic College Email
Dear Student,

is this you? IS THIS THE RIGHT EMAIL?

I have not yet received your application to our obscure college with a funny name and an 80% acceptance rate. What gives? Are you feeling suicidal?

Please review these pictures of grassy fields and smiling college-aged students and reconsider your decision to ignore our school.

Still not interested? Maybe you are poor! Allow us to waive the application fee so you can more easily seal your fate to a life of mediocrity and "huh, I've never heard of that college".

Even though you will never go here, please allow me to conclude this email with an aggressive comment and a pretentious footer.

I look forward to reviewing your application,

Jake
