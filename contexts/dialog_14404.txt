JACOB: What're you ... ? Where's Sarah? Where are the boys?
JEZZIE: Sit down, Jake.
JACOB: Where are they?
JEZZIE: Sit down.
JACOB: No! What's going on? Where's my family?
JEZZIE: It's over, Jake. It's all over.
JACOB: Where have they gone?
JEZZIE: Wake up. Stop playing with yourself. It's finished.
JACOB: What's going on?
JEZZIE: Your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, Dr. Singer.
JEZZIE: What's wrong, Jake? Forget to take your antidote?
JACOB: Who are you? What are you doing to me?
JEZZIE: You have quite a mind, Jake. I loved your friends. That chemist - the Ladder. What an imagination you have!
