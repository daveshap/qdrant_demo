HARRY: Ray Barboni?
BONES: Who is this?
HARRY: Are you the guy they called Ray Bones?
BONES: Depends. Who's this?
HARRY: Who is this? I'm the one telling you the way it is, okay, asshole? That's who I am. Now you want your three hundred grand or don't you?
BONES: What three hundred grand?
HARRY: The three hundred grand a guy named Leo Devoe scammed off an airline. The three hundred grand Chili Palmer now has in his possession.
HARRY: Hello? You there?
BONES: Yeah, I'm here. I just don't like the anonymous crap. It means your either chickenshit or not for real.
HARRY: Yeah? Well, trust me. I'm very for real.
BONES: Okay. So who are you?
HARRY: I work for Harry Zimm, alright?
BONES: Who?
HARRY: Harry Zimm. The man happens to be a major Hollywood player.
BONES: Never heard of him.
HARRY: Maybe that's because you've never been out've fuckin' Miami, dipshit. Maybe it's time you got on a plane, flew out to L.A. and took a meeting with Mr. Zimm.
BONES: So, what, this Zimm guy asking for some kinda finders fee, that what we're talking about here?
HARRY: Hey, Zimm doesn't ask for dick. Zimm tells you the way it is... or else.
BONES: Or else what?
HARRY: Or else use your fucking imagination.
