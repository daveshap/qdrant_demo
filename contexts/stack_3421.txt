Hide Database Secret in offline Java application without user credentials I've been searching the whole last week for any solution but could not find any proper answer and I hope one of you can help me.I've got an Java desktop application which uses a local H2 database (embedded mode) on a linux machine. The database uses an symmetric encryption with a password.The application can be used by anybody without asking for any kind of credentials, passwords or login information.The database secret should be hided and not be visible or editable by users. Finally the application does not have a internet connection.Is there any solution to provide the secret to the application for database encryption while protection the password from users?Or is there any other solution to protect the database data from user access while providing the data to the application?Thank you in advanceSebastian
