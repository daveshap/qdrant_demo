DE BRIS: How would you like to go back to teasing hair, big mouth?
BIALYSTOCK: Roger, do you mind if we talk a little business?
DE BRIS: Please, please, that's what we're here for. Be careful, that hurt.
BIALYSTOCK: I think this would be a marvelous opportunity for you, Roger. Up to now, you've always been associated with musicals, and...
DE BRIS: Yes. Dopey show-girls in gooey gowns. Two-three-kick-turn! Turn- turn-kick-turn! It's enough to make you throw up! At last a chance to do straight drama! To deal with conflict, with inner truth. Roger De Bris presents history. Of course, I think we should add a little music. That whole third act has got to go. They're losing the war. It's too depressing. We'll have to put something in there. Aaahghhh! I see it! A line of beautiful girls, dressed as Storm Troopers, black patent leather boots, all marching together... Two-three-kick-turn! Turn-turn- kick-turn!
BIALYSTOCK: That's genius. That's genius. Roger, I think I speak for Mr. Bloom and myself when I say that you're the only man in the world who can do justice to SPRINGTIME FOR HITLER.
DE BRIS: Wait a minute. This is a very big decision. It might effect the course of my entire life. I'll have to think about it. I'll do it.
BIALYSTOCK: Congratulations.
DE BRIS: Get on the phone. Send out a casting call. Call every agent in town. I want to see everybody. Everybody.
