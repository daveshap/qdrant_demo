Generating a table of distances between points and edges of nearest polygons? I have two shapefiles, one of made up of country borders and one made up of points randomly dotted around an ocean.  How do I generate a table of all the distances between the points and the closest edge of a polygon?So for each point I will have a distance to it's nearest polygon/country.  I've looked at generating a near table but found that I only got distances to one plate (for all the points). Let me know if you need any more information.
