I’m definitely not debt free!
I’m hoping maybe this makes some folks feel better. I’m 44, married, and have a roommate and a mortgage.

My husband and I each have car loans and credit card balances.

No student loan debt at least.

We live paycheck to paycheck.

We’re actively working to pay down debt and I am so so grateful.

I may never be totally debt free and I’m okay with that, and would you believe it, happy?

EDIT: Thank you for all the upvotes and comments. My husband is not my roommate, though I do live with a roommate and my husband. I’m not cavalier about debt, and I’m a semi-devotee of Dave Ramsey. I just recently paid of a credit card and I have 1 left. My reason for posting is because of all the posts where people post screen shots of their paid off credit cards. That’s great, but this is poverty finance folks. Not everyone can get there! I do have a side hustle as does my husband. I’m not thrilled about being in debt but that’s where I find myself right now. Good luck everyone!
