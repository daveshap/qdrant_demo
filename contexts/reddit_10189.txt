If you make enough suicide attempts, people stop caring.
That’s what I feel has happened to me. It’s like I don’t have the right to say “I’m sad” anymore because I either get ignored or eye rolls. 

I’ve come up with a pretty fool-proof way to strangle myself while I am unconscious, and I have decided to have another go at trying to die (this is my fifth attempt, my first I put a gun to head and chickened out, second I stranded myself in the wilderness, third I tried to mix pills, and fourth I basically drank poison).

I didn’t think it mattered, being supported. 

Maybe it’s seeing friends cut me out of their lives one by one. Maybe it’s family looking annoyed and just saying “I’m sorry you feel like this.” Maybe it’s my marriage partner flat-out saying nothing when I tell him I want to die. Maybe it’s my mental condition that causes me constant grief and pain, then shoots me up to mania so I feel like I have no control of my life. Maybe it’s because I’m spending my life savings just sitting at home jobless, I don’t contribute to society, I should be allowed to be euthanized. 

Thanks for listening like usual r/suicidewatch, I appreciate it, no one else wants to. Though you have my gratitude, I hope I never post here again, because I will finally be successful.
