CHIEF NURSE: Of course, I don't know every doctor who works here...
BETTY: Dr. Ravell's the finest surgeon on the staff. You must know him. He's incredibly handsome, gentle, considerate. He's being sued for sexual assault right now, but -- It's not true. He was set up.
CHIEF NURSE: Well, I certainly would have heard about that.
BETTY: Of course, he's only here two days a week. He's also on staff over at Loma Vista.
CHIEF NURSE: ...I don't think I know that hospital.
BETTY: It's in a very pretty area that gets a lot of sun, has palm trees out front, mountains in the background...
CHIEF NURSE: Really? You've just described all of Southern California.
