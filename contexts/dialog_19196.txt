DUFF: That's pretty good for a preacher's daughter.
JOSIE: What d'you expect?
DUFF: You know, baby, I can't figure you out.
JOSIE: How d'you mean?
DUFF: Why d'you come out with me? You slummin' or something?
JOSIE: No.
DUFF: So what you doin' with a cat like me in a joint like this?
JOSIE: You don't think much of yourself, do you?
DUFF: Well, that's a funny thing to say.
JOSIE: You keep asking me why I'm here.
DUFF: Yeah, and you keep not answerin', too.
JOSIE: I like a place with lots of life.
DUFF: How about another beer?
JOSIE: No thanks.
DUFF: Go on - you can have one!
DUFF: Hell!
JOSIE: What is it?
FRANKIE: Well, if it ain't Duff!
JOCKO: How you doin'? Hi there!
