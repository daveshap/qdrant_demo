One of Trump's earliest Executive orders was to remove two regulations for every one enacted. Has this been followed?
10 days after taking office, President Donald Trump signed the executive order "Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs‚Äù.

 The four-page document outlined two key changes to current government operations. First, any new regulation an agency enacts must be met with two regulations that will be eliminated. And second, there will be a cap on the cost of new regulations for the federal government, which will be $0 for the fiscal year 2017.([Source)](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/smallbusiness/2017/02/06/trumps-executive-order-limit-regulations-what-means-your-business/97441676/)

Has this had any impact on how regulations are passed or upheld?  Has it had any meaningful change on how government works?
