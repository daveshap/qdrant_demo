TOMMY: Ah, you know. Howsa pooch?
JACK: Losing his teeth.
TOMMY: No shit. It's the goddamn water. Kill an ox. I buy bottled for my Danny. You can't trust the taps.
JACK: Yeah. Jesus, you look like fucking royalty, Tommy.
TOMMY: Yeah. The big boys sent it down yesterday.
JACK: Another five years, huh?
TOMMY: Like clockwork. You got a good memory, Jackie.
JACK: It ain't always a blessing. My brother here?
TOMMY: He's got blood in his eye.
FRANK: Great. Terrific. Glad you could make it.
JACK: How we doing?
FRANK: How we ... ? What, are you kidding me?
JACK: Am I late?
FRANK: That's not the point.
JACK: What's the point?
FRANK: You cannot continue to walk in at the last moment, Jack.
JACK: You want me to show up late a few nights?
FRANK: Jack.
JACK: Frank.
FRANK: Jack.
JACK: Frank. I'm here. I always get here. Don't sweat it.
FRANK: Christ, will you look at your hair?
JACK: What's wrong with it?
FRANK: You look like you just crawled out of bed.
JACK: No one's gonna be looking at my hair. Come on, we're on.
