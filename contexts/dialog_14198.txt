MARY: Do I look as funny as you do?
GEORGE: I guess I'm not quite the football type. You . . . look wonderful. You know, if it wasn't me talking I'd say you were the prettiest girl in town.
MARY: Well, why don't you say it?
GEORGE: I don't know. Maybe I will say it. How old are you anyway?
MARY: Eighteen.
GEORGE: Eighteen? Why, it was only last year you were seventeen.
MARY: Too young or too old?
GEORGE: Oh, no. Just right. Your age fits you. Yes, sir, you look a little older without your clothes on.
