I'm never calling a hotline again
Yesterday was the second time they called the cops on me. I begged them not to, i refused to give away my location. They still found me, shoved me in their van and took me to the hospital. At the hospital i waited 5 hours for someone to talk to me before they got a mental health professional then, who i had to regurgitate my entire life story to before being promptly dismissed. I would have rather just died than go through all of that.
