JACK: How ya doing, honey?
SHIRLEY: Oh Jack, I'm so warm. I'm burning up.
JACK: Here.
MILTON: After my wife died, I felt like a fifth wheel. You know, so many years being with one person -- a very wonderful person -- makes you always think of yourself as part of a pair...When Ethel passed away, I was lost. I couldn't function socially and I couldn't function in business.
BERNICE: Well, after a thing like that you wouldn't be expected to.
MILTON: But I think it's time we stopped talking about me. A woman like you -- why haven't you ever married?
BERNICE: Well, I'm afraid that's a question that's all too easy to answer.
MILTON: I know the answer -- Career. A smart woman like you became so involved in your work, you didn't have time for marriage.
BERNICE: I wish I could fool myself into believing that that's the reason. The truth of the matter is, nobody ever asked me.
MILTON: You know, here we are having coffee together, and discussing education and business and economy...and we don't even know each other's names...full names I mean.
BERNICE: Mine's Eleanor. Eleanor Schiff.
MILTON: That's a lovely name. Mine's Milton...Milt Ettenhenim. But my friends call me 'Bubbles.'
