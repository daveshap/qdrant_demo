I want to kill myself so I don’t have to work, I have a hard time keeping jobs..
Hello, past a year or two I been having a hard time keeping a job. I just ether don’t like the job, the people there, I feel like I’m always doing something wrong, I hate waking up and wasting my whole day there.

I don’t care about money like really I rather live on the streets or just be dead but my parents keep telling me the same stuff over and over, saying how “Everyone hates working” or “what do you expect to do in life, just sit in our house forever doing nothing” or “that’s life for you, man up stop acting like a kid your a adult now”..
I have a job right now, but honestly I just want to quit.
I managed to keep this job for 3 months but I don’t know what I’m gonna do,All I think about is I’m
going have to work everyday of my life and I have a hard time making it thru one day.. A day feels like for ever, idk everyday it feels like Its my last day.
I just hate living since I can’t function like a normal person for some reason it seems like everyone is able to do everything better then me and I’m just a mistake..
I’m on antidepressants they helped me to get the job I mentioned and probably why I stayed so long but there not helping much I think my depression got worst but idk..

So for rambling I’m just so lost right now in life.. I’m 19 btw
