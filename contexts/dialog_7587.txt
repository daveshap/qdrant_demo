DOMINO: Where are the bond certificates for the First Ladies?
ED: There are no bond certificates.
DOMINO: What do you mean? Claremont didn't provide them?
ED: No. What's the big deal?
DOMINO: Something is going down. Something bad.
ED: Claremont said we deliver the First Ladies in Needles. Then we go home. No questions asked.
