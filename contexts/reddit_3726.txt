Compiling a list of the worst cliche reddit dating advice and assumptions
* Everyone is assumed to be not trying and that you haven't thought to "put yourself out there more."
* While you're at it, "work on yourself" and "focus on what you love," which is to say that anyone who can't get a date must be a complete trainwreck who doesn't already spend hours each week in the gym staying in tip top shape, being social, having interesting hobbies, having healthy habits, having a career, already having a great sense of style and grooming.
* If you stop using the Internet and go out and join some activity or group, you'll automatically meet someone right away because that's where all of these hidden gems of perfect matches have been hiding all along.
* You also haven't already thought of that and tried that a dozen times, and realized doing so was filled with people you weren't into, were not your age, and attractive people who have their shit together never join these kinds of things.
* Guys who aren't succeeding at dating *must* be coming off as desperate. That's the only explanation!
* All women have an endless line of suitors, all of whom are male models, and they never feel lonely or sad with dating and hookups.
* If you say you're lonely and feeling down, someone who knows nothing about your life assumes you're clinically depressed and tells you that you need to go to therapy because heaven forbid anyone vent something that's not positive.
* Online dating works the same exact way for everyone, regardless of gender, location, race, and age, so if it's not working for you, "there must be something wrong with you" or that your profile must totally suck even though you have a Master's in Writing and are a professional photographer who knows their way around words and pictures.
* Just move and get a new job some place where there's more people. That will fix everything, even though you've already done that twice or more, and only found yourself among more people your age who are taken and married, so now you feel even more single than you did when you lived in a smaller area.
* You got ghosted because the person wasn't that into you or they met someone else who was "better" than you, and not because the other person was a sociopath and emotionally abusive.
