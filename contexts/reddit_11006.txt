I'm not strong enough to keep doing this, I need help.
## I know I'm far from the biggest victim of the universe, there's plenty of people that have it far worse than me. I really need to get this off my chest because it's a burden I've been holding for a while and I just no longer know what to do.

I know y'all are busy, so I've decided to put all my grievances in a list, also if you're extra busy I decided to highlight all of the key points:

1. **I feel so lonely**, I've never had a group of friends that I could constantly reach, this has been my life since I was a child. There's plenty of people that know me and people that I can interact with, I'm not an unlikable person but there's no one I have any close connection with, we're just not simply on the same channel. Despite this there're people that do talk to me and I've been ghosting most of these people because quite frankly I don't want to make their experiences worse with having them around me.
2. **I have no drive to continue doing anything**, there's literally nothing motivating to do anything. Simple things like driving a car to be wash, showering daily, brushing my teeth, getting out of bed, etc. are difficult to do. My bedroom has been disorganized since december 2018, I feel really guilty about it.
3. In my search for love this past year, I was greatly disappointed with **my first boyfriend, who apparently left me for his ex.** This has made me feel terrible inside, specially because when I began dating him I told everyone about him, I even told my family. He lied about having an illness and he dumped me because he that he didn't want for me to him deteriorate, months later I texted to check up on him and he told me he was back with his ex and he also told me to stop "obsessing over him" and blocked my number that very same day. **I was so embarrassed I didn't told anyone what happened.**
4. I've had a **lot of meaningless sex** since he dumped me, but on the inside nothing really fills me up. **I don't even have any pleasure having sex** or have sex with guys I would particularly find attractive, however I don't know why I keep doing this.
5. **I have a severe distrust of people** because many of my close friends and the guy mentioned on point number three have made me extremely distrustful of people, it seems every person I think it's a good reliable friend ends up hurting me the most. It seems that for people I'm an acceptable target to abuse.
6. I often feel **my "friends" just contact me because they need something**, not because they actually want to talk to me.
7. **I constantly have suicidal thoughts**, I don't want to be here anymore and I don't understand what's the point of keeping on because I know that every time things get better from me, they don't last. Often times I could be walking near a bridge and in my head I start thinking on how can I ended it all by jumping. I've tried suicide before but no serious attempt recently.
8. **It's hard for me to focus on anything**, it's been getting worse lately, for example I can't open a tab with a YouTube video because I immediately change it.
9. For the last year I've developed a horrible **habit of compulsive spending** shit I don't need, despite all my life being someone that saves money I'm spending it all. I've even spent all my savings from 2016 - 2017 and I feel extremely guilty about it.
10. Last year I've developed a really serious habit of **binging junk food**, like literally spending serious money on junk food to eat in one sitting. For example, this week I've consumed at least 20 cans of coke.
11. I'm extremely **distrustful of people criticizing my job**, I don't like a lot what I do and every time I show someone my work for critiques, I'm mostly met with good critiques, but I feel like they're lying to me. For some reason, deep inside me, I know they're just saying that to be nice and not because they actually mean it.
12. **I have a** **severe problem with perfectionism** and it has made my life worse. Ever since I was little I do things like **compulsively ripping pages of my notebooks every time I dislike the way I'm writing.** This happens in every other aspect of my life. For example, if I don't like how I'm drawing, I rip the drawing into shreds and start again, if I don't like how my phone is organized I delete all the data and I try to reorganize it again, etc.
13. **I have no will power to do anything**, not to start projects or to finish them.
14. Lastly, **I feel ugly as fuck**, I have always felt horrible towards my personal appearance, but lately I know I look like a hot mess.

I feel in a state of emergency because this time I have really lost the will of doing anything about my situation, it's like a train is going to run over me but I can't possibly move because I don't know what to do. I've been to therapists, psychiatrists and psychologists before but I feel really weak right now and I don't know if I can hold to months of talking with a person of debilitating issues I have, so maybe they can finally tell me if I have something. I'm desperate because I need a fix for all of this things, I'm deeply concerned with not getting out of this.
