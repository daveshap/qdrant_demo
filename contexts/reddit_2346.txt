Yale admissions podcast highlights
AO # 1: “Good test scores, interesting EC’s, they get you in the door. After that, it‘s kind of like a game of Yahtzee”

AO #2: “Yeah. I mean, hard classes, high scores, that stuff’s important, but after that, its all a very nuanced process.”

AO #1: “Exactly. Like, this year, I was reviewing two applicants. Two great trombone players, both ISEF finalists, both Nobel prize winners. A tough choice, for sure. So, I was eating a piece of wheat toast and I was like, hmmm, this wheat toast smells like my friend Tom. So I went with the first kid, who’s name was also Tom.”

AO #2: “Yeah. Like I said... numbers, they’re numbers. Sure, they’re important, but after that, it’s all about our mood. If I’m having a bad day after I broke up with my boyfriend of 4 years who happened to be a saxophone player, maybe I’ll reject all the saxophone players. We already have plenty of those anyway!”

AO #1: “Sometimes I just like the font one kid used more than another. THIRTEEN point Times New Roman, now that’s an interesting choice. Stuff like that, it’s what you notice when you spend hours going through applications.”
