Stuck in an Jobless Loop
What are some tips for gaining a consistent job? I have the experience and drive, but for whatever reason I'm not being selected for the jobs I qualify for.

What can I do to improve this and get the job I want?

So far, I find jobs that are flexible but don't pay enough to pay the bills yet are also inconsistent in their hours which add to not paying enough. Or I'm working at night and can't find suitable care for my kids.

EDIT: The loop began after I had my second child last year
