People commenting on other people's weight
Just stop, please.

I lost a lot of weight recently because I went through something quite traumatic *and my friends are aware of that*.

I try not to make too big of a deal out of it. I don't comment on it, I talk about it only when I'm asked, except with a few very close friends. 

Yet so many people still frequently comment on my weight. Some of them because they are concerned, which I get, yet others because they are jealous, which I think is downright insulting, *and I'm just so done with it!*

Also so many people I just barely know and strangers talk about it too. It ranges from compliments to concerned comments. And I just don't get it. 

I wish people could understand that it's not okay to comment on other people's bodies, no matter what their intentions are!! It's none of your business, most of the time they have no idea what's going on so just, for the sake of God, stop!

You're not my therapist and if I'd want to talk about it I would. Period. 

You don't know what a person is going through. Maybe they have a medical reason, an eating disorder, maybe they're just built this way. Who knows. And why do you think it's your business anyway?
