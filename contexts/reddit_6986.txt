Would you post a bad Glassdoor review?
Sooo, I got a job a little bit ago. Perfect fit and everything. A week before my start date, they rescinded my offer because the company was going in a "different direction" (and then proceeded to lay a ton of people off a few weeks later). Apparently this is a cycle for them every few years. I had already quit my other job, of course, and luckily my old boss was gracious enough to keep me around.

Should I post a bad Glassdoor review, given that they'd probably know who posted it? Knowing this information, I'm pretty unlikely to want to work for them ever again, and I feel like people have a right to know...

Would you post it on the employee review part as well? I mean, I signed the papers and everything but it's not like I had actually worked there yet.
