Can I allow Mac using Internet Sharing via Thunderbolt to talk to other devices on network? Does my MacBook - which is connected via Thunderbolt bridge to an iMac with Internet Sharing - see devices on the network the iMac is connected to?I can see a new subnet is created on the Thunderbolt bridge adapter: 192.168.2.xMy main network is 192.168.1.x - the iMac is connected to this on Ethernet adapter.Can I let the MacBook connect to other devices on the 192.168.1.x subnet?I want to connect to a network share on another device in this upstream network.Ideally:I would be able to assign the MacBook with an (additional?) IPaddress in the 192.168.1.x range.Bonjour would be able to finddevices on the upstream network that had file sharing enabled, andshow them in the Finder sidebar.
