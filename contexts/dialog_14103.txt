CAPTAIN: What a hell cat. No controlling these modern girls. They're terrible!
ANDREWS: Terrible! Nothing terrible about her. She's great! Marvelous youngster! Got a mind of her own. Knows just what she wants. She's not going to get it though. She won't get very far. Has no money.
CAPTAIN: What about that diamond wrist watch she had on—she can raise some money on that?
ANDREWS: Holy Smoke! I forgot all about that. Send a wireless at once, Lovington Detective Agency. Daughter escaped again. Watch all roads—all transports and railroad stations in Miami. Have your New York office keep tabs on King Westley. Intercept all messages. Want her back at all costs!""
