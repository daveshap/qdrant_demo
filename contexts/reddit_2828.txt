"Turned down" a job offer months ago and regret it now. What should I do?
I "turned down" a job offer by ghosting and I feel deeply regretful now. I didn't mean to ghost, but at that time I was suffering from very serious mental issues that I wasn't able to sleep, talk, or move.

After months of depression I started to feel better and finally checked my emails and voice messages. I found many emails from recruiters sent around a year go, and they were being very friendly without talking about my sudden disconnection, and tried to discuss a new start date with me. I felt so guilty but considering that the emails were sent too long ago, I gave up calling them back.

\- I know in corporate world I am being super unprofessional, but the more I think about it, the more regretful I am. Is there any possibility for me to explain myself? Or is it even worth it to explain myself?

\- If I want to get my opportunity back what excuses I can use? If chances are low what should I do to avoid being blocked by HRs?

\- Do HRs share a list of red-flagged candidates? It's a well-known large company, and I assume HRs in big companies share some "candidates that you should avoid" list. Should I really explain myself if I still want to find a job in the same city?

Edit: It's an entry-level job and a part of the company's training and development program. It's a top tier international company. The office is in North America.
