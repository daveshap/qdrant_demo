ARNIE: I understand. You're upset. You want to know what's going on. That's good.
HELENA: Why are you talking like that?
ARNIE: Listen to me carefully. First of all, Carl isn't here. DEA's got him and they'll hang on to him until arraignment, which will probably be tomorrow. So here you're wasting your time. Are you with me?
ARNIE: Good. From now on I want you to expect that every word you utter will be tape-recorded, that the movement of your lips is being read. Got it?
HELENA: Arnie, this is crazy.
ARNIE: Got it? Good. Do not discuss anything over the telephone. Do not talk to the neighbors. Stay out of your yard.
HELENA: What is he being charged with?
ARNIE: I don't know, but under no circumstances would I talk about it here. I want you to go home and relax the best you can. Continue your life as if nothing has happened. That is very important.
HELENA: Arnie, I feel like Alice stepping through the looking glass.
ARNIE: That's a very apt analogy, Helena. Now, go home and be with your children.
