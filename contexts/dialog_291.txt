CATES: Nothing. No sign of Ganz. No sign of the Indian. Airport's clean. Train station. Bus station. Docks... Shit...
ELAINE: Ganz is going to be hard to track. Just a pure schizo ... wires all crossed... totally without any pattern... kill anybody... The Indian... himself... anybody...
CATES: How do you know?
ELAINE: Jack, it's all over the papers. He's an obvious type. But this Indian...
HAMMOND: He was the only one of my bunch that was my friend... He was loyal, went all the way for you...
ELAINE: In all due respect, he sounds kind of pathetic to me. The kind of guy that runs home to his momma or some girlfriend. Have you two ace detectives checked that out?
CATES: Yeah, well the only woman of the Indian's we ran into was shacked up with her dyke girlfriend. I guess she went with him before she came outta the Closet ... They both looked mad enough to kill him...
HAMMOND: Yeah, too bad. They were real nice lookin' too...In bed together, hardly any clothes one watching TV...
ELAINE: What makes you think they were lesbians, or as you so quaintly put it, dykes?
CATES: Come on, they were a little old for a slumber party.
ELAINE: It might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions. I was in bed with a girlfriend watching TV last week, Jack, and one thing we know about me is I happen not to be a lesbian ... Now, if this Indian's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him, it could just be she's still vulnerable to him.
CATES: So what?
ELAINE: When a guy hurts you, then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees, who knows, he might just be irrestible.
CATES: Hey, Come on, shrink time's over. They wouldn't go see some old girlfriend.
ELAINE: Oh, yeah, well look where you came when you were down and out.
