I’m so scared.
I don’t know what to do. It feels like I might have a panic attack right now, I’m just trying to stay calm. I don’t really know what to write, or what to say. I just need to do something to distract myself. My parents think I’m doing great with staying home and stuff, but to be honest I’m really stressed. I haven’t done much schoolwork because it makes me even more stressed. I’ve been sewing a lot because I don’t know what else to do. I think of all the people scared right now, and it makes me more scared myself. I don’t want to talk to anybody, because I don’t know what to say. I feel like I want to cry, but I just can’t. Physically, no tears will come out. I’m sorry, I just needed to write something. Thank you if you read this. I’m just in a not very good place right now, health wise. It’s just really hard
