I hate my brain
Basicaly the situation is like this:

Me: ahh seems for a day at least my brain gave me some breath from everything and i can have a decent day

My brain 1 millisecond later: HEY HOW ABOUT I STUN YOU AND MAKE YOU THINK ABOUT THINGS THAT MAKES YOU FEEL GUITLY DEPRESSED AND IN ANXHIETY

Me: I hate this brain


ye this is my situation now plus i want to listen to my sad playlist but i don't feel to listen to it at the same time...
