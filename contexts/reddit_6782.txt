LinkedIn - do you reply to unsolicited interview offers?
I could not find a way to "hide" myself from LinkedIn - I do not want to delete my profile, as I have valuable connections there.

I have unchecked "Looking for a job"; my profile also starts with disclaimer that I am satisfied in my current posting.

&#x200B;

Yet I keep getting spammed with "please add me" and messages with offers for an interview or at least a conversation... it is really annoying.

&#x200B;

I know that with the current economy, employers are begging for someone, anyone, to hire and work for them. And that companies have to refuse customers because they do not have enogh workers to fill the order.

&#x200B;

But we are people as well, and deserve some respect too... yes, it is a sign of frespect to reply to messages sent to me, but there are so many...

&#x200B;

I am half-tempted to just write there "You do not have a chance to match and exceed what I have now, even if you paid me double", but then I would probably still get messages asking "Are you sure? Can we talk about it?"...

(PS: and that actually is true, I like my company's culture, and I love having a workplace within walking distance)
