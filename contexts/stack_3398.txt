What plant are the vines in the fire swamp? In the movie Princess Bride, Westley and Buttercup flee in to the Fireswamp where Westley uses his sword to cut through vines or vine like plants that are obstructing their path.  What are those vine plants?  Are they (meant to resemble) any true to life plant that actually exists (and if so, which one)?  Or are they merely a cinematic representation of the \"jungle vine\" trope plant?
