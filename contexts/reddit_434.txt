Advice
Some background about me I’m a 19yo Male. I recently moved from the city to the suburbs of Chicago. I’m a introvert and I’ve been told by numerous people that I’m very mature for my age. I’m a virgin not because I’m saving myself for marriage but because I can’t bring myself to just have sex with randoms or manipulate to get in too someone’s pants. I’ve also never been in a full real relationship but you probably figured that by now. 

When it comes to women I try not to be picky. No one is perfect especially me, but I do look for woman that are mainly introverted, sweet, and focused. These personalities seem to not be very common. No offense to others but the social media type women just aren’t my type which is fine because I’m most likely not there type but it seems that every girl is like that and it’s becoming difficult to not adjustment my standards because I do want a relationship. I also over think things a little which can be hindering me to an extent.

What should I do? Should I try to engage with more common personalities or broaden my preferences?
