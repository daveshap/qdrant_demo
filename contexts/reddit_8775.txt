Help me understand this new ISP resolution
I have heard about this resolution to overturn some FCC rules that apply to ISPs, most notably that this will re-allow them to share internet activity to third parties. Is this the only thing being changed, or is that merely the worst/most headline-y part of it? Are there any other parts of the FCC mandate that are being overturned for good reason?

Tl;dr: Is the only thing changing with this resolution the 'sharing browsing data' part, or is there more to it?
