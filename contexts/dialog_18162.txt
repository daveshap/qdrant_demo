LUCIANO: Johnson's still on board. Even Maranzano won't screw with Nucky in Atlantic City. But everywhere else, we got nothing but problems.
SIEGEL: I'll knock 'em in, Charlie. I can do it. Blow his fuckin' head off. Get rid of the bastard for good.
LUCIANO: You wouldn't live out the week.
LANSKY: We got exactly two choices, Maranzano or Masseria.
SIEGEL: They don't give a shit about us!
LUCIANO: Masseria's scared. He might make our deal.
SIEGEL: We can't sell out to those guys. They ain't businessmen!
FRANK: But Maranzano's got the men and the brains.
LUCIANO: Which is why he doesn't need us.
