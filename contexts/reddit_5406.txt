What to do about racism at work?
I’m currently very low level management at a thrift store. I’m struggling with managing some of the employees making unwelcoming/vaguely racist comments when South Americans and Central Americans come to the store. I’m unsure of what to do with the situation. Not only do I find their comments incredibly offensive, but if someone else were to hear them (they’re not very quiet) it would be easy to get into a lot of trouble publicly. I’m half the age of these women, so if I ask them to do something, they don’t really listen. But, I think this is something worth talking about with them. I’ve seen two occurrences of this happening, and both times I’ve been so shocked, that I didn’t do anything. I walked away and didn’t participate in the conversation. I’ve spoken to another coworker about this, and I think my first choice of action will be to simply tell them I don’t talk about people in that manner, and they need to be careful of how they speak about people on the sales floor. My second choice of action if I see it happening again will be to tell the store manager about their behavior. 

Does this seem like a good line of action?
