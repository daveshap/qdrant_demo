MR. ROSE: Where's your manners? Make room for Homer, so's he can enjoy the view.
MUDDY: What view?
HOMER: Are we supposed to be up here? The rules said...
MR. ROSE: Homer, you the only one who's read them rules, so you the only one who feels like he's doin' somethin' wrong.
MUDDY: *What* view?
MR. ROSE: Well, Muddy, we can look at all these angry stars Homer's been readin' to us about.
JACK: I bet the view looks better from the Worthin'tons'.
MR. ROSE: You think so, Jack? Well... I wouldn't want to be in that Wally's shoes tonight.
ROSE ROSE: Daddy, I'd like to be in that Wally's shoes *every* night.
MR. ROSE: You lucky you in your work boots tonight, girl...
ROSE ROSE: What's lucky about that?
