Anyone have experience working for Florida Blue?
Hello!









Hope someone can help me out. Last week I applied for a remote Member Care Specialist position with Florida Blue. Today I just got an email saying I've moved to Step 2 which is a video interview. 










I've never had a position like this before, and I'm wondering what to expect. I know they offer full benefits, job is remote, and you work 9 months of the year with 3 months off during the summer (all paid). 











Has anyone had the same or similar role? I couldn't find much online about whether the job is stressful, etc. I'm currently working a low stress/easy job with similar pay and no benefits. Definitely no paid 3 months off. So I want to know before I interview if there's a "catch". 










Thanks!







Edit to add - If you can't tell by reading my post, I'm interested in a low/minimal stress job even if it's not lucrative. I don't want to worry about work after my shift is over.
