Statistics in print composer Qgis I would like to add a table with some statistics in the print composer. I want to show the rate of feature for a specific value. Let say I have a \"Existing\" field with 'Yes' or 'No' properties. I want to add a table with Y% Yes / X% No I tried to use the expression dialog but with no success. For info: I am on mac OSx and can't use SQL requests as there is an important but since 2 years with this.
