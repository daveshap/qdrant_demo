VCVS in LTSpice Operating as a Comparator I am using a VCVS in LTSPICE.I am confused about the command in the Spiceline for using a Table.I want to use the VCVS as a 1 bit Comparator instead of making a transistor based one.What will adding the following spiceline for a VCVS in LTSpice do ?table=(-0.5 0, 0 0, 1.0e-6 1, 0.5 1)Will it set the output to 0 when the VCVS is input with -0.5, 0 output when it gets 0, 1 output when it gets 1u and one output when it gets 1?Is this correct ?Thanks.
