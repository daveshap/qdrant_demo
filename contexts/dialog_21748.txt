RALPH: What are you people doing out in the middle of the night?
FLORENCE: I'm after news, as usual. I wonder if it would be all right for me to slip in and look around your factory?
RALPH: I guess so. But wouldn't it be better for you to wait until the old man's here?
FLORENCE: Well, I'll tell you a secret. I kinda like the old gent and I'm trying to build a special Sunday Magazine story out of him. It might help him a whole lot. But that's a side issue -- something I do on my own time.
RALPH: Gee, that's great. After the bad opening that night the old boy was pretty blue. This will pep him up. Have you told him about it?
FLORENCE: No. I wanted to do it without saying anything. I think he's worth it.
