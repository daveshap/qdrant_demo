I can't help my girlfriend and I feel like she doesn't appreciate me trying
It seems like almost every day now that she texts me saying that she feels fat, how she hates herself, how she's a failure and that she doesn't deserve to be happy. I give her advice, I compliment her, I point out her strengths and explain how she's not failure. She's not fat... 

When she's with me she's usually really happy, but every now and then out of nowhere she'll get really upset where she's short with me and won't let me touch her. I usually try to leave her be when she's like that, but it's so hard to see that look on her face knowing she's beating herself up and if I do try to help she just sounds annoyed with me. 

It's literally almost everyday now of her texting me about how she hates herself. I try to help her, but she never tells me that she appreciates me trying or that I even help a little. 

I don't know, maybe I'm just not very comforting.
