CLAUDIA: Patrizia... Patrizia ... Where's Ettore?
PATRIZIA: I imagine he must be inside sleeping.
CLAUDIA: Would you please see if Sandro is with him? He's not in his room. I'm sorry to disturb you.
PATRIZIA: Ettore...
ETTORE: What is it?
PATRIZIA: Nothing, nothing at all. I was just looking for Sandro.
ETTORE: And you expect to find him in here? Go and ask Claudia.
PATRIZIA: Yes, yes, of course.
CLAUDIA: Patrizia, I'm afraid.
PATRIZIA: More or less, we are all afraid. Especially at night.
CLAUDIA: I'm afraid that Anna has come back. I feel she's back, and that they're together.
PATRIZIA: But what's gotten into you?... We would have known. Sandro must be out in the garden somewhere, taking a breath of fresh air, or watching the break of dawn. It would be a lovely surprise indeed if he turned out to be the sentimental type.
PATRIZIA: Now, listen. For God's sake, try not to let yourself become obsessed with that idea. Go to your room and get back into bed.
CLAUDIA: Just several days ago, the thought of Anna being dead would have made me sick. And now, I don't even cry, I'm afraid she might be alive. Everything is becoming so damned simple and easy, even to deprive one's self of pain and suffering.
PATRIZIA: You should never wish to get melodramatic over anything.
CLAUDIA: Yes, you're right. I'm sick and tired of being like that.
