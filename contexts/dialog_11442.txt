BEN: Are we getting married tomorrow?
ELAINE: No.
BEN: The day after tomorrow?
ELAINE: Maybe we are and maybe we aren't.
MR. ROBINSON: Do you want -- do you want to try and tell me why you did it?
BEN: Mr. Robinson?
MR. ROBINSON: Do you have a special grudge against me? Do you feel a particularly strong resentment for me?
BEN: No, it's not --
MR. ROBINSON: Is there something I've said that's caused this contempt? Or is it just the things I stand for that you despise?
BEN: It was nothing to do with you, sir.
MR. ROBINSON: Well, Ben, it was quite a bit to do with me.
BEN: Now look -- please --
MR. ROBINSON: Ben, I think we're two civilized human beings. Do you think it's necessary to threaten each other?
BEN: I am not threatening you.

BEN: Listen to me. We got -- we got into bed with each other. But it was nothing. It was nothing at all. We might -- we might just as well have been shaking hands.
MR. ROBINSON: Shaking hands. Well, that's not saying much for my wife, is it?
BEN: You miss the point.
MR. ROBINSON: Don't shout at me, Ben.
BEN: The point is -- I don't love your wife. I love your daughter, sir.
MR. ROBINSON: Well -- I'm sure you think you do, Ben, but after a few times in bed with Elaine I feel quite sure you'd get over that as quickly as you --
BEN: HUH?
MR. ROBINSON: I think I've talked about this enough. I don't know how far I can go, Ben. I don't know if I can prosecute or not, but I think maybe I can. In the light of what's happened I think maybe I can get you behind bars if you ever look at my daughter again. I have seen Elaine and I have spent the afternoon taking steps to insure...
