I deserve to die because I’ve done awful things
Not saying what they were. They were not things I knew were wrong till later. If I had known then how much it would hurt people I would never ever done it. I don’t want to hurt anyone, but I have and I haven’t meant to. So all my suffering now is punishment for doing the awful things I didn’t know were awful till much later.
