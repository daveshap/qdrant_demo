KATKA: I thought for sure they would catch me.
DOUG: Thanks.
KATKA: Will it help to get you out?
DOUG: I hope so!
KATKA: If you get out can we be together again.
DOUG: I'm no good for you Katka, besides I won't be able to stay in Prague.
KATKA: But we could go to London and live in England.
DOUG: No Kat, I lied to you, I hate England and I don't ever want to live there again.
KATKA: I don't understand, it's your home?
DOUG: There's nothing there for me.
KATKA: I'm sorry about what I said, really I am. Just take me with you, I don't care where.
DOUG: Forget about me Kat.
KATKA: But I love you!
DOUG: It was a mistake, I never wanted to hurt you, but it had to end sooner or later and now, well now I love someone else.
KATKA: No, it's not true, you're lying.
DOUG: Not this time, Kat.
