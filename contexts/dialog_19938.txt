DEL: All right gentlemen, let's get down to it. I need to know if you're for real.
CHARLIE: If we're for real?
DEL: You don't exactly look like drug dealers.
WESLEY: Isn't that the point?
DEL: Yeah, well, I don't have time to screw around. I got buyers in Dallas, Houston and Vegas who are ready to snap this stuff up.
CHARLIE: We appreciate that. But you just poured me a drink, I'd like to enjoy your hospitality for a few minutes.
DEL: Fine. You got five...
CHARLIE: It's a nice place you got here. Real comfortable. Sweet little town, Fair Oaks. You like it here?
DEL: Are you kidding me? What's to like?
WESLEY: Seems like a nice place.
DEL: It is, if you like idiots...
CHARLIE: What do you mean?
DEL: It's a small town, man. I never should have left Omaha. People here think small. They act small. They're a bunch of dumb fucks.
WESLEY: Really?
DEL: You better believe it.
CHARLIE: Could you give us an example?
DEL: Of what?
CHARLIE: I'm asking you for an example of one of these dumb fucks being a dumb fuck.
DEL: I don't follow...
CHARLIE: You're not a dumb fuck, are you, Del?
DEL: No...
CHARLIE: I didn't think so. So, give me an example of a stupid person doing a stupid thing. Not being stupid, you're equipped to recognize it.
DEL: Are we gonna do business here, or not?
WESLEY: Relax, we brought the cash.
CHARLIE: I'm just curious. Can't you give me an example?
DEL: All right... lemme see... okay, new Burger King opens up. These assholes get excited and start lining up. Like it's some five star restaurant. The place is mobbed. Right?
CHARLIE: Hmmmm. Five Stars
WESLEY: No, that's ignorant. They just don't know any better.
CHARLIE: That's what I thought. You better give me another example.
