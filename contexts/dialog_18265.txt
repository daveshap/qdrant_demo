RAYMOND: Cosmo. Many years ago, when they told me you were marrying my sister, I was happy. When I told Rose I was marrying Rita, she was happy.
RITA: Marriage is happy news.
COSMO: Rose, pass the wine.
RAYMOND: I never seen anybody so in love like Cosmo back then! He'd stand outside the house all day and look in the windows. I never told you this cause it's not really a story. But one time I woke up in the middle of the night cause this bright light was in my face. Like a flashlight. I couldn't think a what it was. I looked out the window, and it was the moon! Big as a house! I never seen the moon so big before or since. I was almost scared, like it was gonna crush the house. And I looked down, and standing there in the street was Cosmo, looking up at the windows. This is the funny part. I got mad at you, Cosmo! I thought you brought this big moon over to my house cause you were so in love and woke me up with it. I was half asleep I guess and didn't know no better.
COSMO: You were altogether asleep. You were dreaming.
RAYMOND: No. You were there.
COSMO: I don't wanna talk about it.
ROSE: Well, what do you wanna talk about!
COSMO: Rita. Pass the wine.
ROSE: Why you drinking so much?
