Does Amazon drug test their IT staff/white collar workers regularly, or just at hire?
I'm still in college, but I'm getting IT certifications to work in IT. I plan to work at help desk for a year or get an internship as a Jr Network Administrator and I'm looking at large companies I can move up in or work under and relocate to a legal state (marijuana) while still working at the same company.
