Film about a guy who wakes up to messages on the inside of his window, multiple times, when no one else is living there He initially wipes the messages off but then decides to try and work out what is going on by going to some of the places that the messages say - one mentions a girl and an alleyway but of course he doesn't know which one. He, at one point, is being followed by a shadowy figure that turns out to be the dad of the girl that the guy is trying to help/he makes friends with. We eventually find out that his future self is essentially taking control of his past self whilst he's sleeping to write these messages, though I don't think he's always in control of it.I think it was made within the last ten years and probably a lower-budget film. There are more scenes I remember but I think I'm mixing films up so I don't want to confuse things.
