MADELEINE: Do you hear anything?
SCOTTIE: Only silence. It's always like this.
MADELEINE: And no birds sing.
SCOTTIE: No birds live here.
MADELEINE: No.
SCOTTIE: Would you like a drink of water?
MADELEINE: No, thank you.
MADELEINE: Somewhere in here I was born... and here I died and it was only a moment for you... you took no notice...
SCOTTIE: Madeleine!
