Is a Bachelor of Arts (Major in Political Science or Economics) enough for a job in Marketing, should I be aiming for a Bachelor of Commerce instead? (Going to get an MBA either way)
Hi everyone, I'm a senior in high school and is in the process of applying to colleges. My dream job is to work for Disney or Apple in their marketing department and I wanted to set myself up for that. My college admissions have been ok so far and I've gotten into a couple of BA programs for Political Science or Economics but my parents are pushing me to do a BCOM. Since I'm going to do an MBA after college, does it really matter in the future what my undergrad degree is? Thank you!
