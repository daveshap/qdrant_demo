FRIDA: Hello?
PETER: Frida? You okay? Look, I think I know what happened to Mark. I want to help. I'm coming over.
FRIDA: NO! Don't come over. Peter... I... I don't want to see you anymore. Ever.
PETER: What? Is there someone else?
FRIDA: Yes, sort of. I mean no, not really.
PETER: Yes or no? Frida, can't you just be honest with me?
PETER: You at least owe me the truth.
FRIDA: You want the truth? Remember I tried to tell you something the other day?
PETER: Yes, your PMS. Frida I can deal with that.
FRIDA: No you can't. It... it gets so bad that I become a werewolf.
PETER: If you don't like me, just say so. You don't have to make up some bullshit like you're a werewolf.
FRIDA: I knew you wouldn't believe me! Just go away. Go very far away!
