JOE: Yes, I saw you see me.
PARRISH: Well, you're at the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong woman.
JOE: I'll be the judge of that.
PARRISH: I'm her father!
JOE: With all due respect, Bill, I'm not asking your permission.
PARRISH: Well, you goddam well should. You walk into my life, give me the worst news a guy can get, have me dancing on the heads of pins with my busi- ness and with my family, and now you're spooning with my daughter.
JOE: 'Spooning'?
PARRISH: Yes, and stop repeating everything I say, and turning it into a question. Spooning, fooling around, God knows what. You arrive on the scene -- why you picked me, I still don't under- stand --
JOE: I picked you for your verve, your excellence, and for your ability to - how shall I say - instruct. You've lived a first-rate life. And I find it eminently usable.
