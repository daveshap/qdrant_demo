Informational interview
Hi everyone,

I'm doing an informational interview with one of my advisor's colleagues tomorrow. This individual does research in an industry setting. I've drafted some questions to ask such as why did you choose industry vs. academia? What does a typical day look like for you? Do you find there's room to learn new skills with in your job title? Do you spend more time at the bench or doing administrative work? What do you enjoy most and least about your job? Etc.

Any suggestions on important questions I should ask? I want to make the most out of this opportunity.

Thank you!
