The outside world is ugly and depressing yet people mock me for trying to escape.
My family is toxic and abusive. I have 0 friends and I can't make any due to my social deficits and anxiety. Going outside is pointless, because the streets are ugly and filled with dog shit and I need to breath through my mouth for most of the way. Trying to start a conversation with anyone is pointless because most of the people around here are elderly, extremely conservative, and annoying and will make it clear that their frontal lobe is deteriorating with age. Besides that, there's a lot of foreign people around that don't know English, and I never even got along with the native population because of conflicting values and being nearly unable to communicate in the native language. Cue misunderstandings, people being very annoyed with me and looking at me in suspicion because of that.

I cannot escape into the countryside because we barely have any left, and what is left is filled with rubbish, criminal hunters, and yet more dog shit. At least maybe if I lived somewhere like Germany or Sweden, I'd think how if I killed myself I wouldn't get to experience all that beautiful nature.

And I find it absolutely maddening how people chastise me for trying to isolate myself from the world. The environment around me is objectively, fucking ugly. And the only way I can deal with it is by spending time in the virtual world; video games, forums, writing. It's literally been my life support for years. It only barely keeps me alive, but if I didn't have it I'd be doing some worse things to escape, or I'd just kill myself.
