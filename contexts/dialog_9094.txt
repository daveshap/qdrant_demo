VICTOR: Got it. So take a walk, Ben... I'm going to borrow Susan for a second.
REED: Sure.
JOHNNY: Please tell me your dawg's not trying to rekindle things with my sister.
BEN: 'Course not. Strictly business.
JOHNNY: Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
BEN: Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.
JOHNNY: Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God? Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp. Hmmm, it's a toss-up.
BEN: Put your tiny little mind at ease.
JOHNNY: Don't you wander off, boy.
VICTOR: Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?
SUE: I understand the business reasons.
VICTOR: Well, when you're looking at your future, it never hurts to find closure about the past.
