VADA: She lives here too?
PHIL: Ahh, that's right, like one big happy family. This is Nick's room and uhh....
VADA: But...are you engaged or something?
PHIL: Dating, seriously dating. You're thirsty, want something to drink? Sure you do, it's been a long trip.
VADA: Sounds like you have a fear of commitment, Uncle Phil.
PHIL: That's ridiculous, I'm...I'm very, umm, what do you call it?
VADA: Committed?
PHIL: Committed.
VADA: So does that mean that you sleep here every night?
PHIL: Yes, it does.
VADA: Well then that's not exactly dating is it.
PHIL: Vada, I know that traditionally you're not supposed to do a lot of these things before you're officially married...but these are very, very special circumstances.
