MORPHEUS: Every attempt to fight them has ended in failure. Only a handful of men and women have ever crossed an agent and lived because they are everyone and they are no one. Unkillable. But now I believe that is going to change.
NEO: How?
MORPHEUS: I've seen an agent punch through a concrete wall. Men have emptied entire clips at them and hit noting but air. Yet as powerful as they are, their speed and strength are but tethers to the rules of an unreal world. Because of this, they will never be as strong or as fast as you can be.
NEO: What? Are you trying to tell me that I can dodge bullets?
MORPHEUS: No, Neo. I'm trying to tell you that when you're ready, you won't have to.
