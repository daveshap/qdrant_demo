PHILIP: Could be a new dance... Walking the Shark.
KATHRYN: Thanks for helping.
PHILIP: Not at all.
KATHRYN: Why are you?
PHILIP: I like it when they wake up.
KATHRYN: So do I. But for different reasons.
PHILIP: And I like you.
PHILIP: You were quite daring in capturing him. Very skillful indeed.
KATHRYN: Skillful? I missed my first shot.
PHILIP: Some miss all their shots.
KATHRYN: Somebody could have gotten hurt.
PHILIP: That's what life is, Doctor. Full of chances to hurt yourself, or somebody else.
KATHRYN: You're a strange man, Mr. Hutton.
PHILIP: Philip.
KATHRYN: Before, you were ready to feed this shark a hand grenade. Now you're helping to nurse it back to life.
PHILIP: That's because I am the shark.
KATHRYN: We're all from the sea, Mr. Hutton. Our destiny is linked to the fate of the oceans. By continuing to destroy fish, man destroys himself.
PHILIP: The grenade's just to intimidate Whitey. He knows I have it, so he watches out. Same is true when I film lions, tigers, rhinos...
KATHRYN: I think that you and I are natural enemies.
PHILIP: And here I thought I was charming you.
PHILIP: Hello. I think his nap's over.
KATHRYN: Get ready to go.
PHILIP: Believe me, I am.
KATHRYN: Brian, he's coming around!
PHILIP: Well, Doctor. You've got your shark.
KATHRYN: Thanks to you.
