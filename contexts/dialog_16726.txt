RICKY: So whenever we want...
JIMMY: Yeah. Grab one of the cards behind you. Call that number. It's my cell.
RICKY: So you're our own private guy?
JIMMY: I handle most of Cardiff Giant's stuff.
RICKY: You know my pager number?
JIMMY: No. What is it?
RICKY: I don't know. I thought you might. Any idea what the job is?
JIMMY: The 'job?' Alls I know is I'm taking you to the Soho Grand.
BOBBY: Where is the Soho Grand?
JIMMY: Soho.
BELLMAN: ...And here is the key to the mini- bar. Room and tax has been picked up by Cardiff Giant, as well as one fifty in incidentals.
RICKY: What's 'incidentals?'
BELLMAN: Phone, room service, mini-bar. Any additional expense. If you need anything you can push the button marked 'Concierge', and they'll be able to help you.
