Z: Did you see that? How he gave <u>you</u> the beers, not me? I'm telling you, he's got something against workers.
WEAVER: I don't know what you're talking about, Z.
Z: Come on -- everybody dumps on us workers. You soldiers get all the glory. Plus you get to go out into the world, meet interesting insects, and kill them.
WEAVER: Yeah, but you get to spend all day with those fabulous worker babes.
Z: Weaver, they're career girls. They're obsessed with digging. No, I'll probably never meet the girl for me.
WEAVER: Who said there was a girl for you? I was talking about a girl for me. Don't you want your aphid beer?
Z: I can't help it. I have a thing about drinking from the anus of another creature. Call me crazy.
WEAVER: Z, we've known each other a long time, right?
Z: Of course. You were born two seconds after me.
WEAVER: And all the time I've known you, you've been grumping and groaning. You should quit making waves. Go with the flow.
Z: Weaver, I'm an insect, not a liquid.
