Job Hunting when you are tied to one area
Hello,

I'm attempting to transition from academic affairs to student affairs but I can only job hunt in my immediate area. (Dallas/Fort Worth) Luckily there are several universities here but because I can't look outside of this area when job hunting I know I am at a huge disadvantage. Has anyone ever had this issue and how to you make in roads and connect with people since you are confined to this one area?

Thanks!
