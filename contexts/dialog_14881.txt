JIM: I want to thank you, Mr. O'Keefe, for this time.
O'KEEFE: Call me Willie. I ain't got nuthin' but time, Mr. Garrison. Minutes, hours, days, years of'em. Time just stands still here like a snake sunnin' itself in the road...
BILL: Clay Bertrand, Willie?

Sometime in the late summer of '63.

Dave's smart - real smart - speaks five languages, knows philosophy, medicine, military history, politics. He wanted to be a priest but they defrocked him 'cause he was queer...
BILL: And that's where you met Oswald for the first time?
O'KEEFE: Yeah, strange guy. Dave introduced him as...
