[META] To those joining us from AskReddit...
First of all, welcome! We're glad that you have decided to explore our little home. Please remember, however, that the rules for discussion on /r/NeutralPolitics are much stricter than elsewhere on reddit in order to protect the standard of discourse that we Neutrons value. The [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/pteu5/meta_rneutralpolitics_frequently_asked_questions/) is required reading before you start posting and will give you a better understanding of who we are and what we are about. The [voting guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/ptgxf/meta_rneutralpolitics_guide_to_downvoting_and/) is also very useful since we have a different attitude about what is worthy of upvotes or downvotes than most subreddits (Namely, *don't downvote someone just because you disagree with them!*).

If you have any questions, feel free to ask away. Otherwise, enjoy the subreddit!
