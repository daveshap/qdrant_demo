GUS: Ain't you go nothin' better to do than to come in here and jack off the damn machine?
NICK: What are you doing here, Pop?
GUS: I came in here to jack off the damn machine. One dead psychology professor. Noah Goldstein. Dr. Noah Goldstein. And guess what? He was her counselor.
NICK: Was she ever suspect?
GUS: No, sir. They never even got a statement from her.
NICK: Do you remember a case -- 1956 -- Hazel Dobkins?
GUS: Hell yes! Couldn't get it outta my head for years. Still can't. Nice little kids -- nice husband, wasn't porkin' around -- no financial problems. One day -- outta the clear blue sky -- she does 'em. All of 'em. Used a knife. He got for a wedding present. Didn't even deny it. Sweet as honey. Said she didn't know why she done it.
