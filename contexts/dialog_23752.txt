JANET: I won't be a party to this. I want to see Brad.
NATION: The question is, does Brad want to see you? Quite frankly, he hates you.
JANET: What do you mean?
MAC: Brad has deep feelings of hostility towards you.
JANET: Me?
MAC: It's classical. Almost a textbook case...
MAC: That's an extremely negative response.
NATION: Yes, Janet. Leave the crying to Brad.
JANET: Is it because I'm becoming too popular?
BERT: On the contrary. He wants to see your ratings soar. He needs a woman of exceptional desirability.
