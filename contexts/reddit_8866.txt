Why did Michigan Ban plastic bag bans?
My home state of Michigan recently passed [Public Act 389](http://www.legislature.mi.gov/documents/2015-2016/publicact/htm/2016-PA-0389.htm) which is "a bill to preempt local ordinances regulating the use, disposition, or sale of, prohibiting or restricting, or imposing any fee, charge, or tax on certain containers." 

The bill is a reaction to legislation from my home county, Washtenaw, which enacted a [10-cent bag tax for paper and plastic](http://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/index.ssf/2016/06/10-cent_bag_tax_at_washtenaw_c.html). The State legislation killed our county level legislation. This didn't get much play in the media but what was out there called it a [plastic bag ban ban](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/12/30/yes-this-is-real-michigan-just-banned-banning-plastic-bags/?utm_term=.dfe273b3e67f#comments).  

**Is there a legitimate reason to preemptive block municipalities from passing taxes on undesirable containers such as plastic bans?**

My research is below.
Washtenaw County hoped to address two main issues with the ordinance:

* To offset the costs of processing plastic bags, which it estimated at $219k [per year](http://www.ewashtenaw.org/government/departments/environmental_health/recycling_home_toxics/carryout-bag-ordinance/Reusable%20Bag%20Ordinance%20Work%20Session%20PresentationFINAL.pdf) (the tax would bring in an estimated $220k [per year](http://www.wastedive.com/news/update-michigan-becomes-seventh-state-to-outlaw-bag-bans/426773/))
* To reduce plastic bags in the environment to mitigate harmful environmental effects, such as the fact that plastic bags take [1,000 years to degrade](http://www.ewashtenaw.org/government/departments/environmental_health/recycling_home_toxics/carryout-bag-ordinance/Reusable%20Bag%20Ordinance%20Work%20Session%20PresentationFINAL.pdf)

3 potential arguments for the State level legislation:

**Plastic bag bans hurt business**
Los Angeles County California banned plastic bags and charged a $.10 fee for paper bags. They found a 100% reduction in plastic bags, a 25% reduction in paper bags and a [minimal impact on most businesses](http://ladpw.org/epd/aboutthebag/PDF/Bag%20Ban%20Status%20Nov%202012.pdf).

**The taxes are regressive, they hurt the poor more**
This one does have merit. An impact assessment concluded that an average family uses 720 plastic bags at grocery stores [per year](https://conservingnow.com/plastic-bag-consumption-facts/) 720 x .$10/bag = $72/year in taxes.

**Don't tell me what kind of bag to use!**
I think the crux of the argument really is personal freedom, ie, the "don't tell me what kind of bag to use argument."
