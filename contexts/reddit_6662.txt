Recruiter said they'd schedule an interview but didn't hear back yet
A recruiter said he'd hand me off to another recruiter who works for the location I'm applying to. He said she'd call me soon yesterday to set up an interview and I said "Alright, I'll be waiting", but I still haven't heard from her today.

I've gotten calls for different jobs but this one pays really well, so I'm willing to wait. How long should I wait before I give up and pursue another offer? Should I bother asking him about when she'll call if I don't hear from her next Monday?
