Can i really get a job if i complete a few courses in data science through udemy/coursera etc without having a bachelors degree?
I messed around and didnt complete my bachelors, now im 27 years old, with high school education and basic knowledge of IT and a little bit of programming.

Ive really got nothing else to do in my life and if i start investing my time sites mentioned in the title, can i actually land a decent job?

If yes then which courses do you people recommend? Im kinda confused, data science or web development or networking or machine learning?

Ive done some python, but the last thing i did with it was making a save editor for minecraft :P

Thanks in advance.
