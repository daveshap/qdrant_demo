Any other perpetual single ladies here who feel broken?
I've been asking for a long time why I've never been in a relationship? Am I ugly? No I'm decently attractive and I've had various sexual encounters. Maybe I have a weird personality? But my friends all like me. Possibly I'm just unlucky, I don't know.

But I'd like some advice on how to meet a guy who is looking for a girl like me. I'm very compassionate, easy going, and adventurous. 

I've been at risk for abuse in dating because my standards at this point are very low. So I'm tired of that. Ideally I'd like to find someone worthy of me and my values. 

Any other women in the same boat?
Men, any advice?
