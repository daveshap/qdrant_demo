KENNY: Jesus...
BOBBY: Rescind the order. Can all the Chiefs. Put Nitze, Gilpatric and the Undersecretaries in charge.
KENNY: We can't do that, Bobby.
THE PRESIDENT: He's right, we can't rescind DEFCON 2. The Soviets will think we've gotten sweet on them.
KENNY: And we can't purge the Chiefs. Our invasion talk will look like a bluff. Or even that there's been an attempted coup.
