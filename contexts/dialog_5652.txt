REGGIE: You're right. I remember Grandpierre looking through it. But there was nothing in it -- at least, nothing that the police thought was very important.
ADAM: Can you remember anything at all?
REGGIE: Grandpierre asked me about an appointment Charles had -- on the day he was killed.
ADAM: With whom? Where?
REGGIE: I think it only said where -- but I can't --
ADAM: Think, Reggie, you've got to think -- it may be what we're looking for.
REGGIE: That money's not ours, Adam -- if we keep it, we'll be breaking the law.
ADAM: Nonsense. We didn't steal it. There's no law against stealing stolen money.
REGGIE: Of course there is!
ADAM: There is? Well, I can't say I think very much of a silly law like that. Think, Reggie -- please think -- what was written in Charles' notebook?
REGGIE: Well -- it was a place -- a street corner, I think. But I don't -- Hold it. I'm on.
