FATHER BARRY: You all right, Nolan?
NOLAN: Yeah, considerin' they was usin' my head for a baseball!
FATHER BARRY: Nice fellows.
NOLAN: Those blood suckers. How I'd love to fix those babies but—
FATHER BARRY: But you still hold out for silence?
FATHER BARRY: You still call it ratting?
NOLAN: Are you on the level, Father?
FATHER BARRY: What do you think?
NOLAN: If I stick my neck out, and they chopped it off, would that be the end of it? Or are you ready to go all the way?
FATHER BARRY: I'll go down the line, Kayo, believe me.
NOLAN: Baseball bats— that's just for openers. They'll put the muscle on you, turned-around collar or no turned-around collar.
FATHER BARRY: And I still say you stand up and I'll stand up with you.
NOLAN: Down to the wire?
FATHER BARRY: So help me God!
NOLAN: Well, I had my fun, I've drunk my fill and I tickled some good-lookin' fillies— I'm on borried time.
