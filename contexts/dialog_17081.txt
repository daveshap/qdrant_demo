GRAHAM: This is Will Graham. Can I help you?
VOICE: No. I can help you.
GRAHAM: I don't understand.
VOICE: Atlanta and Birmingham.
GRAHAM: Do you know something about that?
VOICE: Why do you think I called?
GRAHAM: I get a lot of calls. Most of them are from people who say they know things.
GRAHAM: Talk to them a few minutes and you can tell they don't have the capacity to even understand what's going on. Do you?
VOICE: You tell me what you know about him. I'll tell you whether you're right or not.
GRAHAM: Let's get straight who we've talking about. Are you the man I'm interested in?
VOICE: I don't think I'll tell you.
GRAHAM: He's right-handed.
VOICE: Most people are.
GRAHAM: He's misunderstood.
VOICE: Cut the general crap.
GRAHAM: He's very strong physically.
VOICE: That's true.
GRAHAM: He's white and six feet tall. You haven't told me anything yet.
VOICE: Describe exactly what you think he did to Mrs. Leeds and I'll tell you if you're right or not.
GRAHAM: I don't want to do that,
VOICE: Goodbye.
