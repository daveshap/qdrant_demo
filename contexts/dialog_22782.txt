RAMÓN: Want to go up to your office, Mr. Alexander?
ALEXANDER: Naturally. You think I parked here for a cup of coffee?
RAMÓN: You're welcome to one.
ALEXANDER: No thanks.
RAMÓN: The men would like to know who this gentleman is.
ALEXANDER: That's none of their affair.
HARTWELL: That's all right -- it's no secret. My name's Hartwell. I'm from the company's Eastern office.
RAMÓN: You mean Delaware?
HARTWELL: No. New York.
RAMÓN: New York? You're not the Company President by any chance?
HARTWELL: No ...
RAMÓN: Too bad. The men've always wanted to get a look at the President. But you've come out here to settle the strike?
HARTWELL: Well, if that's possible ...
RAMÓN: It's possible. Just negotiate.
HARTWELL: Are we talking to a union spokesman?
