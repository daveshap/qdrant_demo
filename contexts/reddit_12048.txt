Fuck not driving
So 17, and still dont have my Class 7 license yet. (basically means i dont have my learners to get my full class 5 license) I've been reading the book for such a long time and every time I go into do the test I just blank, or i get to 29/30 and fail the test. its gotten to the point of hearing about the drivers test I get anxious about it. I really want to be able to drive and burn this fucking bus pass. And im in my senior year so it's like I am expected to have this license; or at least have the chance to get behind the wheel and learn. I feel like I can't even ask my parents to help me study for it because they will just guilt me about it, and it has happened in the past.
