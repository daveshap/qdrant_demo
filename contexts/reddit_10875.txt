Does anyone feel like a functioning suicidal?
I feel like I could end it all at any second and get some relief. But I also go through the motions of life like I'm planning to live for so much longer. I go to class for the most part, eat food, try to look groomed on the outside. In a way, I feel like people can't take me seriously. All my so called friends just look at me like there's nothing wrong with me. Even though I tell them things, it's like the end of the day I look okay on paper, so I must be okay. My parents know I feel like this but they already have my life planned out and I feel trapped. It's been a constant trend in my life where even if I tell people I'm struggling, no one believes me. I think that's part of what has driven me to this point because no one wants to help. I don't know if I'm the only one who feels this way 

Edit: I'm honestly surprised at how much attention this has gotten. I just want you all to know that your feelings and thoughts are valid no matter what and should be treated as such. There's still a lot of stigma about mental health in general but I fully believe everyone is entitled to treatment and a therapist who will sympathetically listen to their problems no matter what. None of you deserve anything less than that. I've tried my best to respond to all the people who responded but my inbox is always open to messages if anyone wants to say anything. Thank you guys so much for making me feel like this isn't so abnormal
