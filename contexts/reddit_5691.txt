Any advice on job I could work for 1 week?
Question: Advice for remote or limited people contact jobs with flexible hours for 1 week?! 


Hi! I’m an ABA Therapist at a school district. Luckily we are budgeted to get payed during this time while we work from home, however, we are not budgeted to get payed during what was supposed to be April Vacation at the end of the month. I was curious if anyone has any advise on possible jobs I could work remotely at home or maybe somewhere where I have very limited exposure to people during these times. I usually would work at my other job as a paraeducator Pardiem but they’ve had three covid breakouts there any I’m in too close of contact with people at that job unfortunately. Thanks!
