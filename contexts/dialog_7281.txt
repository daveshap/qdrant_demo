MERLE: You should have put that on last night.
NICK: I know.
MERLE: That way it sets.
NICK: Yeah.
MERLE: I just wait. You know?
NICK: Huh?
MERLE: I just wait. For this... It's what I wait for... I wait all year.
NICK: So do I.
MERLE: You do?
NICK: Yeah.
MERLE: You think about it?
NICK: Yeah.
MERLE: So do I. I want to be ready... You have to be ready... It has to be there, in your mind.
NICK: The shot?
MERLE: Fucking A.
NICK: I don't think about the shot that much.
MERLE: You have to think about the shot. It's the shot. The shot's it.
NICK: Yeah... I guess.
MERLE: What do you think about?
NICK: I don't know... I guess I think about the deer... Being out, maybe. I don't know. I think about it all. Hell, I like the trees, you know? I like the ways the trees are, all the different ways the trees are too.
MERLE: I'll tell you something, Nick. I wouldn't hunt with anyone but you. I won't hunt with a yo-yo.
NICK: Yo-yo! Who's a yo-yo?
MERLE: Who's a yo-yo...? Who do you think's a yo-yo! They're all yo yo's. I mean they're all great guys, for Christ's sake, but... The point is, Nick, without you I'd hunt alone. Seriously. I would. That's what I'd do.
NICK: You're a fucking nut. You know that, Merle? You're a fucking maniac!
MERLE: Yeah. When it comes to hunting, that's true.
NICK: Albert! For Christ's sake... John! Wait a minute, you guys!
ALBERT: It won't open.
NICK: You gotta hit it here. Here, Albert, not there.
ALBERT: Where should I hit it? Just show me where I should hit it.
NICK: Here. Hit it here.
