Turning off the \"activities\" hotcorner at the top left? I am finding it hard to turn off the hotspots on the desktop (Ubuntu 18.04.2) at the top left corner that shows up with a miniature version of the windows I have available to switch to. The stuff I can think to search for like \"activities hotspot ubuntu\" are all too generic to get me there.I checked gnome-shell extensions in Firefox, but I didn't see anything obviously it and am not very familiar with the interface yet. Does anyone know what to call this feature? I just want to turn it off because it false triggers all the time when I hit close buttons on a maximized application, and having two monitors makes this happen as well when on a second monitor that shows no floating taskbar.Where are such configurations stored in the latest version?
