In the “home stretch” for my classes, but finishing everything feels hopeless—any advice?
My classes went online about a month ago. I knew right off the bat this wasn’t going to be a good switch for me, motivation and focus-wise. In the beginning, I actually adjusted pretty well. However, now that it’s down to the wire (two weeks left of class), I feel overwhelmed and hopeless.

The only big assignments I have left are three essays, two final exams, and a final project. I also have a few regular assignments to finish before all these are due. I’m attempting to work on one of the essays that’s due this Friday, but it feels hopeless. I feel like it’s going to be an awful essay, that I might as well not turn it in, and that it’s impossible for me to finish all these assignments over the next 2-3 weeks. 

My university is providing the option to take an ‘S’ grade for classes, so if I get above a D-, the class doesn’t affect my GPA at all. Part of me wants to take an ‘S’ for all my classes and simply give up on the rest of the assignments. However, I know the guilt will eat me alive if I do this. Plus, I can’t guarantee I’ll get above a D- in every class if I decide to take this route.

Is anyone experiencing something similar, or has in the past? Do you have any advice for dealing with this debilitating lack of motivation? I know I’m so close to the end of the semester, but it still feels impossible.
