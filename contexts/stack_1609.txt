What\u2019s the max instant current draw from a Li-Ion protected pack? I\u2019ve been looking for this and couldn\u2019t find the answer so far.What\u2019s the max current that those Li-Ion video camera protected battery packs, as the Sony NFP-550, NFP-970 can handle? I know for instance that the NFP-F550 has usually 2600mAh capacity and 7.4V, but has an internal protection circuit that handles short circuit, over and under voltages and also overcurrent.Is there a limit in current they can supply, even if it discharges faster?Thanks!Edited for correction of decimal points!
