HANS: I know what you are feeling. But this is not productive --
KARL: He was my only brother...my only family! I want blood for my blood. We search...now.
HANS: No. Heinrich's team must finish planting the detonators...and Theo needs time on the vault. After the			* police come they'll waste hours trying to negotiate...that's when we search			* for this man. Until then...we do not alter the plan.
KARL: And if he alters it...?						*
ELLIS: What's happening?
HOLLY: They don't look happy...something's gone wrong.
ELLIS: The police...?
HOLLY: John.
ELLIS: John? Christ, he could fuck this whole thing up...what does he think he's doing?
HOLLY: How about his job?
ELLIS: His 'job' is 3000 miles away. Without him, they might let us go...at least we have a chance...
HOLLY: Tell that to Mr. Takagi.
