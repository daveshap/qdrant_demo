KOESSLER: Collected shoes too?
KULOK: You should have seen the store manager at Parade of Shoes. She was inconsolable.
MACKELWAY: Murman and Imelda had been slipping into a private chat room. Low had poor old Testa drooling on the keyboard. Abduction fantasies, voyeurism, mutilation, teasing him with fetish elements. He is very good. I think it's safe to say Richard Low is Murman.

You keep at it. We'll find him, we'll find him in our own way.
