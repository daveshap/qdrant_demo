Everyone in my family I cared about is dead at 19 and anxiety is making me want to die.
My dad was an alcoholic and killed himself when I was 10. My uncle who was like a father figure to me died of cancer when I was 13. My grandpa who was also like a father figure to me died of a major artery burst when I was 16. My mom was very mentally ill, she attempted suicide many times throughout my life since I was a kid and in some ways she was emotionally abusive to me but I still cared about her and she died of cancer last march, I'm 19. I'm living on my own now and have to pay bills but the problem is I have nearly crippling anxiety which makes it hard to work because almost everytime I go in the whole time I have really bad anxiety and keep having the thought repeat in my head that I'd rather kill myself than continue feeling like this. I've been working for 3 weeks now and almost everyday I've burst into tears while working. For the last month I've spent every day wandering whether or not I should kill myself I really enjoy living and for now I'm too scared to kill myself but anxiety is a cunt.
