LUCAS: You don't know?
WALTER: Know what?
LUCAS: I'll be asking the questions. Last night, you hear anything unusual? Screams? Shouts?
WALTER: No.
LUCAS: A man was badly beaten across the street. You know anything about that?
WALTER: I was asleep.
LUCAS: I didn't say what time the assault occurred.
WALTER: You said last night. I went to bed pretty early.
LUCAS: The assault took place at approximately seven thirty.
WALTER: I went to bed around seven.
WALTER: I wasn't feeling well.
LUCAS: I could take you downtown.
WALTER: You could. It'd be a waste of your time, though.
