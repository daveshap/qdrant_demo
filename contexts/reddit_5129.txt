I keep getting invited and have a positive interview, then I'm rejected for having too little experience
I just had an interview yesterday that seemed to go really well. I had an answer to all questions and they actually didn't really ask me much technical stuff. It went for 90 minutes and towards the end they kinda acted like it was already fact that I'd be starting soon.

Today I get the rejection for being 'too junior' (Junior software dev) and having too little experience. I mean my experience is right there in my CV. Did they think I'd suddenly pull something new from my sleeve?

This has happened several times, I get interviews or at least a first phone interview and people keep mentioning how positive their impression is, how pleasant the talk was etc but then the rejection comes for not having enough experience. Can they truly not figure that out before inviting me? Or do you think they are really using it as an excuse? I am a junior dev applying to junior dev offers so idk what they expect.
