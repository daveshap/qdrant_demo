Can you easily find friends' ghosts? I don't currently have Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, only the Wii U version. I'm trying to assess whether the deluxe version has some functionality I've been really wanting.On the Wii U, my friends and I would all run time trials on the same machine, under different profiles. However accessing each other's ghosts was very problematic. We'd all friend/follow each other, change our private/public settings, post to miiverse and wait, ext, ext and it just wouldn't work consistently.We tried everything, but in the end we only had access to a fraction of each other's ghosts, sporadically. This was a very simple task on the Wii, you could just access all the local ghosts.Is sharing local ghosts something that can be done more easily on the switch, or is it using the same system as the Wii U?<br><br><br><br><br>Bonus question: when downloading \"Online Ghosts\do you have different options besides the top 10 of all time and a few other people within milliseconds of you?Update: I've purchased the game and my experience is in an answer below.
