ADAM: Right.
HELEN: I just hope this is still good up there.
ADAM: Mom?
HELEN: Yes?
ADAM: I was thinking that, uh...you know, while I was up there and all...that maybe I could, you know...try to meet a girl. I've, been thinking about that a little...just these last...fifteen years or so.
HELEN: Oh, Adam,that would be wonderful if you could find a girl. One who's not a mutant...and hopefully comes from Pasadena. Nothing against Valley girls, but in my day anyhow, the girls from Pasadena, I don't know...always just seemed a little nicer.
ADAM: Yes, ma'am.
