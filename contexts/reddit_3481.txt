Plenty of Fish is the biggest, shittiest waste of money I have ever spent on a dating app.
Which is saying something, since it's the ONLY one I've spent money on. First off, the site/app/clusterfuck is filled to the brim with "robot" scam accounts that tdy to get your card and phone number to take your money, but they are disguised as a woman who likes you. Unfortunately, tbe only way to find this out is to pay for a POF subscription to even SEE who it was that liked you. Then they have something called LIVE! ...Don't even get me started on LIVE!.. it is filled with massive amounts of stoners, smokers, alchoholics, drug addicts, you name it. The most "normal" it ever gets is running across a guy wearing a baseball cap and a hoodie (Like any good stereotype) or a girl chilling in her room at night just to talk and not get attention. But, for the most part, it is a shitstorm of a popularity contest with a tornado of random animations flying across the screen and covering up your keyboard to keep you from typing whilst you watch two people on cam "date" to earn a virtual and meaningless "diamond" currency that does jack shit but show off your e-peen/e-gina. I tried emailing customer support for my money back and they told me all sales are final. 

Fuck Plenty of Fish and fuck online dating services. They're as bad as I judged them to be before I ever even decided to give one a chance. Never again am I spending money on this bullshit. I probably missed some details but I'm so angry right now I don't give a fuck.
