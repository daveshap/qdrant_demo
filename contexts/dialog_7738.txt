GROUCHO: Hey you!!
CHICO: All right -
GROUCHO: Have you got a license?
CHICO: No, but my dog he's a got millions of them --
GROUCHO: What kind of a dog is he?
CHICO: He used to be a bloodhound but he's anemic --
GROUCHO: Well - what is he now?
CHICO: He's half poodle and half watch dog -
GROUCHO: Half watch dog?
CHICO: Yeh, he's only got one eye.
GROUCHO: I don't know much about dogs but you ought to be on the end of a leash - a ninety-nine year leash - Look - what do you call your dog?
CHICO: I don't call him, I whistle.
GROUCHO: What do you whistle?
CHICO: Yankee Poodle.
GROUCHO: I've got just the place for a man like you but I'm too busy right now to do any digging. What do you call your dog when you want him?
CHICO: I don't want him.
GROUCHO: Well, if you don't want your dog why don't you put him in a pound?
CHICO: He only weighs ten ounces --
GROUCHO: I can use you in the House of Representatives. We need a man who understands dogs -- and that's where this country is going to. Step inside.
GROUCHO: In case of fire, how long will it take to empty this place?
BOB: About - thirty-four seconds.
GROUCHO: We'll start a fire -- -- and get rid of these microbes.
