Using Powershell can you insert a macro into Access? I am using PowerShell to automate an export of an access databse (.accdb) to postgresql. As a step of that I am using a VBA script to convert all the table and column names to lowercase so they play nicer with postgresql queries. I would like to insert the macro that would perform this task after I copy the database to a local location. This is prevent the cleanup script ever being run on the production database.My question is, using powershell is it possible to insert  a macro into an access database? I can find documentation on how to do this with excel but as far as I can tell it doesn't translate to access. Edit: Alternatively a macro that can create another macro with a given input or a macro that will execute code fed to it via an input parameter.
