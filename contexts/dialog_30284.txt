CONCANNON: Dr. Thompson, just so the Jury knows, you never treated Deborah Ann Kaye. Is that correct?
DR. THOMPSON: That is correct. I was engaged to render an opinion.
CONCANNON: Engaged to render an opinion. For a price. Is that correct? You're being paid to be here today?
DR. THOMPSON: Just as you are, Sir...
CONCANNON: Are you board-certified in anesthesiology, Doctor?
DR. THOMPSON: No, I am not. It's quite common in New York State...
CONCANNON: ...I'm sure it is, but this is Massachusetts, Doctor. Certified in Internal Medicine?
DR. THOMPSON: No.
CONCANNON: Neurology?
DR. THOMPSON: No.
CONCANNON: Orthopedics?
DR. THOMPSON: I'm just an M.D.
CONCANNON: Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?
DR. THOMPSON: I know of him.
CONCANNON: How is that?
DR. THOMPSON: Through, through his book.
CONCANNON: What book is that?
DR. THOMPSON: Meth...Methodology and Technique...
CONCANNON: ...of Anesthesiology?
DR. THOMPSON: `Methodology and Techniques of Anesthesiology.' Yes.
CONCANNON: How old are you?
DR. THOMPSON: I am seventy-four years old.
CONCANNON: Uh-huh. Still practice a lot of medicine?
DR. THOMPSON: I'm on the staff of...
CONCANNON: Yes, we've heard that. Doctor: you testify quite a bit against other physicians? Isn't that right? You, you're available for that? When you're paid to be there?
DR. THOMPSON: Sir. Yes. When a thing is wrong...as in this case, I am available. I am seventy-four years old, I am not board-certified. I have been practicing medicine for forty-six years and I know when an injustice has been done.
CONCANNON: Do you, indeed. I'll bet you do. Fine. Fine. We'll save the court the time. We will admit the Doctor as an `expert witness,' fine.
JUDGE: Do we have time this morning to... All right. Mr. Galvin, you want to continue now, or we can resume with Dr. Thompson this afternoon.
GALVIN: Thank you, your Honor, I'll continue. Dr. Thompson. Did you examine Deborah Ann Kaye last night at The Northern Chronic Care Facility?
DR. THOMPSON: I did.
CONCANNON: Objection.
JUDGE: Sustained. Yes. The witness will confine his testimony to review of the hospital records.
GALVIN: What?
JUDGE: I believe that's the law...is it not, Mr. Galvin...?
GALVIN: Dr. Thompson. From your review of the hospital records of May twelfth nineteen seventy-six. In your opinion, what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye?
DR. THOMPSON: Cardiac arrest. During delivery her heart stopped. When the heart stops the brain's deprived of oxygen. You get brain damage. That is why she's in the state she's in today.
GALVIN: Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes. In your opinion is his estimate correct?
DR. THOMPSON: It's my opinion it took him much longer. Nine...ten minutes. There's too much brain damage.
JUDGE: Are you saying that a failure to restore the heartbeat within nine minutes in itself constitutes bad medical practice?
DR. THOMPSON: Well...
