ETHAN: Not yet. We did manage to pull any sensitive equipment and material out of our safehouse wreckage.
SWANBECK: We could lock down passport control and all ports of authority, but that won't stop Ambrose, and beyond him, we don't know who else we're looking for -- all terrorist bank accounts of which we're aware are stable. No deposits, no withdrawals. Therefore no suspects.
ETHAN: We think we've got our finger on the buyer.
SWANBECK: Do you? Even assuming you're able to prevent Ambrose selling Chimera, you've now got an additional problem. You destroyed all of Chimera at Biocyte. If Ambrose is going to sell Chimera now, he'll have to do it by taking a pint or so of Miss Hall's blood to market.
ETHAN: Yes, I believe that's right.
SWANBECK: But that leaves another seven or eight pints of Chimera.
ETHAN: You mean that leaves Miss Hall.
SWANBECK: Yes, I believe that's right. Now my understanding is that 20 hours after exposure, the victim becomes infectious. Highly infectious.
