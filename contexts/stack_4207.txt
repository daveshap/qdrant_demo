Destruction of space colonist's technology Colonists from Earth colonized an exoplanet and for a few decades everything was fine, but one day Earth is destroyed by a nuclear war or whatever, so no more communication, help etc with it. Then, all the complex technology have a problem and I would like to find out what kind of catastrophe could cause it :It has to make satellites, spaceships, computers and modern communication like mobile phones not working anymore and you can't repair them. They can recycle parts of the electronics but can't make a computer or a  mobile phone (I want to make my colonists using low frequency radio communication).Colonists still can produce electricity so not too much damage to the solar panels, still in order to use radio communication.It doesn't destroy the ecosystems (and the colonists of course), I could bear something like fire but not a gamma burst.I'm not sure that a computer virus or crazy A.I. could respect my first rule and it looks too much like 2001 so something else would be good.
