I live with a thief.
I'm now out $500 and a piggy bank I've had since I was born. I'm fairly certain I know who's doing it, but I have no way of proving it and I know he'll just deny it if I accuse him. 

There's nothing I can do. Losing that piggy bank... I don't know why it hurts so bad, but I feel like I'm practically on the edge of a nervous breakdown. And I can't even afford therapy because that's part of what that money was for.
