[Advice Needed] Was a TA to a coworker during grad-school and now I’m feeling ostracized
So as the title says, I TA’ed a course during grad school and now a couple years later I just started a new job and turns out of one the students from the course is my coworker. Since starting it’s felt very cliquey and then eventually the student/ coworker expressed that they were very unhappy with their grade from the course. I thought it was a joke at first but it’s come up several times now and I’m not sure what to do. I can’t really apologize, can I? What do you all think?
