To those saying 'you'll hurt so many people by dying'
Look, pal. I've got nobody. I've celebrated both my 18th, and 20th (and many more) birthdays alone, crying my guts out. 

Never have I ever had a boyfriend of any sorts, boys wouldn't even try to bully me from a distance.

My childhood best friend hasn't chatted with me in years and the only encounters we have are extremely awkward and unpleasant. 

My parents both have depression and are mostly emotionless creatures who never listen to what I have to say. They love watching TV and sitting at home. My mom thinks I'm autistic. 

My classmates show me pity sometimes, but jump out of the train whenever I try to communicate with them like normal people.

I'm sick and tired of 'behaving myself' so others would be happy that I don't cause any trouble.

I pray every single day I get cancer so at least somebody (doctors) would care about me for a bit before I finally die. Sometimes I dream of losing a limb, or ending up in a wheelchair, but I just don't care. If that happened I would no longer have to try to pretend to be useful.

I just wish, so very badly, to just disappear. Everyone hates me and I hate me. And I want to die.
