Why is being human so frowned upon in the corporate world?
I have years of experience in Corporate America. And what I've noticed is that employers couldn't care less about you as a person. You are to do your job, fall in line, and obey the chain of command, and that's it. Try to insert your personality into that? Not going to happen. Try to help improve morale by treating others like human beings and speaking up about what's wrong? Not going to go over well.

I have seen so many workplaces with so many miserable employees, and the root cause of it is that being human is not allowed. It's all about image and employees know that if they break away from that, even if it's to do the morally and ethically correct thing, they're going to be labeled "trouble" and they're not going to rise in the ranks. It's not right.

It's no wonder that people call the corporate world "soul-sucking" and are counting down the days until they can escape. It is truly a demoralizing place to be.
