MIGUEL: Why are you getting dressed?
ANDREW: You're not going to like this. Please try to smile...
ANDREW: Thanks for leaving school, and coming here, and... I will be back. An hour, tops.
MIGUEL: You're going to the office?!
ANDREW: You're not smiling.
MIGUEL: You're leaving the hospital? You're going into the office looking like that? Are you insane?
ANDREW: One hour!
MIGUEL: Drew!
ANDREW: I promise!
