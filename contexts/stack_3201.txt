Looking for the name of story similar to the song Space Oddity I read this story in an anthology book that must have been from the 70's or 80's. In it, the narrator tells us that he's seeing someone impossible, and that he must be wrong, then goes into flashback:He tells the story of an astronaut, which has many beats reminiscent of Space Oddity or Major Tom. The astronaut's transmitter is working but he can't receive, and his transmissions spark an international effort to develop the infrastructure to launch a mission to save him.There's a twist ending:<blockquote class=\"spoiler\">   the whole thing was faked to spur development of space travel technology. The narrator thinks he's seeing the astronaut, and wonders what the sacrifice of his entire life for this cause must have been like.</blockquote>If anyone remembers the name of the story or where to find it I'd very much appreciate it!
