BOBBY: Look, Harlin.
DARRELL: Darrell.
BOBBY: Darrell. I'll get you your money. I just have to get something out of the trunk.
BOBBY: What the fuck did you do to my trunk?
DARRELL: Well, that key's not gonna work. I had to pop the lock. You didn't leave me the trunk key.
BOBBY: And you had to go into the trunk, didn't you?
DARRELL: When I work on a car, I work on a car.
