HAWKINS: I know.
NICOLETTE: What do you mean you know? He told you he was gonna propose to me?
HAWKINS: Well, he...
NICOLETTE: I want to hear everything he said.
HAWKINS: I'm trying to tell you.
NICOLETTE: Alright. Go ahead.
HAWKINS: That morning. He was talking to me and Leon about marriage.
NICOLETTE: Oh my G-d. We were having lunch here. He started making overtures - talking about little shoes next to his in his closet but I got a call to anchor - and I walked out on him. I walked out on him when he was trying to ask me to marry him!!
