Girl is a descendant of the Brothers Grimm. Has powers that relate to their stories and the surname \"Grimes\" There's a story I read a few years ago that really got me interested. From what I can remember, it's about a girl who's a descendant of the Brothers Grimm, and her mother and her have to move constantly because they're being followed. The protagonist's fake last name is 'Grimes', and she's constantly bullied over that. Lastly, she basically has powers involving the stories that the Brother's Grimm wrote.
