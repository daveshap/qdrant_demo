KELVIN: You killed her!
SARTORIUS: Not her. It.
KELVIN: You murdered her!
SARTORIUS: Kelvin, she begged me. I had a short- range version of the destabilizer prototype, a miniature with a range of a few meters. She walked into it and disappeared. She was gone.
KELVIN: She'll come back.
SARTORIUS: No, she won't.
KELVIN: Why would you let her to do that?
SARTORIUS: It's not human, Kelvin. Whatever it is, it's not human, and I am threatened by that. Evolution-of- the-species-at-stake threatened. And I want to win. I want humans to win. So I am killing it before it kills me.
KELVIN: You fucking bastard...
SARTORIUS: Whose side are you on?
SARTORIUS: It's changing characteristics. It's solidifying taking on weight.
KELVIN: How quickly?
SARTORIUS: If it continues, it will implode from its own weight and turn into a black hole in about four hours and pulls us in with it.
KELVIN: Where's Snow? Did you call him?
SARTORIUS: Yes.
