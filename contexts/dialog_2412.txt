MR. THOMERSON: Nice shot.
COLE: Thank you, sir.
MR. THOMERSON: I know you're as unhappy as I am about Debbie's marriage to Rick.
COLE: Yes, sir, I am.
MR. THOMERSON: Cole, I don't want you to give up on her.
COLE: I've tried to change her mind.
MR. THOMERSON: It's not her mind you need to change. It's Disneyland head in there.
COLE: But how can I do that?
MR. THOMERSON: If it were me, I'd reason with him first. Then, if that failed... ...I'd take more persuasive action.
COLE: Thanks for the advise, sir.
MR. THOMERSON: Keep me informed.
MR. THOMERSON: The thought of that person marrying my daughter makes me want to upchuck.
MRS. THOMERSON: You can tell a man by his friends.
