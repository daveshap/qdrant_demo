Necessity of having two instances (Reader and Writer) in Amazon Aurora I'm managing an Amazon Aurora account. Somebody set it up months ago.The service has TWO instances (same AZ):- project- project-eu-central-1bSame class (db.t2.small), but different \"Replication Role\". First is Reader and the second is Writer. The service has only one cluster:project-cluster-1I wouldn't like paying twice if I need only one instance but I'm not sure if Aurora actually needs two instances (W and R) to work or it was a bad initial setup.Can I use one instance for reading/writing and \"move permissions\" on MySQL-side?I'm also interested in \"Reserved instances\". In actual scenario I think I need to buy two reserved instances, right? Thanks.
