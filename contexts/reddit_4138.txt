I got turned down tonight
I had a really chill day today. Stopped at work for a few hours of easy OT just to check on some deadlines. Was productive. Went home and smoked/napped.

Went to the mall down the street to browse shoe deals. Ended up buying some shirts from cotton on. The manager was super cute and we even had a laugh at check out. 

Left the store, went downstairs and sat on the coin massage chairs trying to build up the courage to ask her out.

Walked back up to the store and asked her if she could help me out with something (kind of hinted toward another part of the store because there were customers/coworkers). Anyways she didn’t budge positions and asked me what I needed. I smiled and simply asked her if she was free tonight. She smiled, laughed and said “tonight?? Uhh, I’m not I’m sorry” while blushing. 

I just smiled back, said ok and left. She was super cute. I haven’t asked a girl out like that in YEARS but I feel it was the right way to do it. Made it easy for her to say no and just walk away. Felt real nice. Still does. 

Everyone’s happy.
