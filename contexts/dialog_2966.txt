RENE: Uh huhh... Band practice? It's Benny. He wants to know why you're not at band practice...?
BASQUIAT: Fuck... I forgot about that.
RENE: Fuck band practice... If you're gonna be a painter you're gonna have to break a few hearts – you don't wanna be like Tony Bennett..
BASQUIAT: Tony Bennett... What do you mean?
RENE: Singing on stage and painting in your spare time.
BASQUIAT: I didn't know Tony Bennett painted.
RENE: My point exactly.
RENE: So keep painting.
BASQUIAT: Yes, Boss. If you're so smart, why are you here with me in this basement?
RENE: You're news. I want the scoop. I write it down. When I speak, no one believes me. But when I write it down, people know it's true. There's never been a black painter in art history that's been considered really important, you know?
BASQUIAT: So what?
RENE: So shut up and keep painting..
BASQUIAT: What time is it?
RENE: 5:11.
BASQUIAT: That one's for you.
RENE: Thanks... I'll take it tonight.
BASQUIAT: I can't. After the show.
BASQUIAT: Hey – it's the big A.M..
ALBERT MILO: Rene's been telling me about your work.
ALBERT MILO: Is this finished yet?
BASQUIAT: I don't know.
ALBERT MILO: When's your show?
BASQUIAT: Not sure. How was yours?
ALBERT MILO: I haven't decided yet. Rene, you wanna come over to the studio tomorrow. I wanna make a painting of you.
