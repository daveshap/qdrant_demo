REIBEN: Sir, what if they send some other company into Caen ahead of us while we're pinned down here?
MILLER: Don't worry, we're the only Rangers this side of the continent, we've got to be first into Caen.
SARGE: Who cares?
REIBEN: I care. Don't you know what Caen's famous for, Sarge?
SARGE: Frogs?
REIBEN: Lingerie.
SARGE: Yeah? So?
REIBEN: So, you ever heard of employee discounts? My uncle sells shoes, gets twenty-five percent off everything in the line, got a closet filled with the best looking shoes you ever seen.
REIBEN: Just picture some French number been spending all day, every day, making cream-colored, shear-body negligees with gentle-lift silk cups and gathered empire waists, what the hell you think she wears at night?
MILLER: Reiben, how the hell do you know so much about lingerie?
REIBEN: Lingerie is my life, sir. My mother's got a shop in Brooklyn, I grew up in it, from the time I could crawl, we carry Caen lingerie, it's the best there is, it's all I been thinking about since the invasion.
MILLER: There's a war on, good chance they're not still making lingerie in Caen.
REIBEN: Oh, Captain, they'll always make lingerie, it's one of the three basic needs of man -- food, shelter, silk teddies. Miller Dream on, private.
