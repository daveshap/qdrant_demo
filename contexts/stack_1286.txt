Can a motion sensor switch be installed as part of a pair of switches? I have a switch to my hallway by my garage. The other switch is by my stairs. I have had a motion sensor on the switch by the garage for about 15 years and it worked fine.<br>It finally broke so I replaced it and now the new one will not work. I cannot even use the manual switch to turn it on and off. I bought a cheaper one (about $17) whereas the previous one was around $30. Is it possible that some switches are not designed to be part of a pair? How can I tell? I don't mind getting the $30 one, but I wanted to be sure. The behavior is that if I use the non-sensor switch, I can turn the lights on and off in the normal fashion. But the motion sensor switch just acts like it doesn't work, no matter what position the other switch is in. I do see the blinking blue light telling me the motion sensor switch is working, but it doesn't. I have double-checked the both wires and the ground. All are connected solidly. Am I wasting time? Are some switched just not designed to work in pairs?
