I'm sick of this culture
I just can't stand it anymore. All the partys I go to play shit music, even though I'm not shunned for what I like, I am still frowned upon when I mention it. For example, I love old video games and nintendo. Everyone in my school always talks about the new games that are coming out and when I mention A game such as sonic generations, they all just laugh and say things like "why don't you go suck sonics dick?0" I usually reply with another insult and we get into a friendly insult fight. I also don't listen to mainstream music, Infact the only "real" band I listen to is the beatles. Most of the time I listen to video game music. Which again I am frowned upon for. I am not really one to get depressed but whenever I think about this I start to get abit sad. Anyone else feel this way? Also, any advice on how to deal with this decaying culture?
