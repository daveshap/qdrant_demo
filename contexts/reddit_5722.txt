When applying online for p/t retail jobs, is it worth trying to find out the name of the hiring manager for the cover letter?
...and following the "traditional" approach to writing a cover letter? having your details on the top right, the addressee details on the left - below my details, and something like "Dear Mr \[name of person\]" etc...

&#x200B;

Also, how should I go about finding the contact details of the hiring manager?
