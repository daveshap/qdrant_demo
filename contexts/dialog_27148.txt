MARGO: Turkish Gecko, I believe. A lizard.
KAWAKITA: Lizard DNA and human DNA on the same strand? Impossible. The sample must be contaminated.
MARGO: There's another possibility. A lot of repeated base pairs could suggest a high level of genetic damage.
PENDERGAST: Genetic damage?
MARGO: When DNA is defective, it often uncontrollably replicates long repeating sequences of the same base pair. Viruses can damage DNA. So can radiation, certain chemicals. Even cancer. Let's let the G.S.E. sort it out. I have to get started. This will take several hours.
PENDERGAST: We need someone to take us to the secure storage area.
