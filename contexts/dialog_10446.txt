WASHINGTON: Damn-it! You've given us a whole new season, Benedict! And Congress thinks that the British are going to ride right over us come spring. Now half their army is back in Canada.
ARNOLD: Congress has picked up it's skirts and is racing for Baltimore. They're not waiting for spring! Of course, they still had time to deny my promotion. Even John Adams voted against it...
WASHINGTON: Why in hell would John do that? Why in hell would any of them do that? After all you've done, it's unbelievable!
ARNOLD: Oh, they have reasons... there's a lot of confusion these days.
WASHINGTON: They don't trust me, that's the truth isn't it? Sam Adams never did.
ARNOLD: But trust you to do what? One side in Congress wants compromise; another glorious battle; some surrender -- some, of course, just want power and money. But if you don't mind my asking, George, what are your plans?
WASHINGTON: We're in bad shape, Benedict, moral is low. Before I can do anything, I need Lee and his seven thousand troops. I've ordered him to join us three times. In my last letter I all but begged him to come here. The man is insubordinate.
ARNOLD: The man's waiting for you to get wiped off the stage so he can become commander and chief.
