TAZINARI: [Yes. Many times.]
CREASY: [O.K. So tell me more.]
TAZINARI: [There was no ten million dollars.]
CREASY: [The ransom was ten.]
TAZINARI: [Two and a half. That's how much there was.]
CREASY: [Don't lie to me!]
TAZINARI: [Two and a half! The rest was paper! Strips of paper!]
CREASY: [Maybe your men stole from you.]
TAZINARI: [No. Whoever took the rest took it before the exchange.]
CREASY: [Who gave the bags to Ramos?]
TAZINARI: [His lawyer. Jordan Kalfus.]
TAZINARI: [That's all I know! Please. I'm sorry for the girl. But it was business! I'm a professional.]
CREASY: [That's what everybody keeps saying.]
CREASY: Another favor... get me banking info on Jordan Kalfus. U.S. deposits or withdrawals. Thanks. Oh, get me the same on Samuel Ramos.
ROSANNA: How do I contact you? We still don't have the ATM info.
CREASY: You don't, I'll call you. Oh! I have a tape recording that I am sure will interest you.
