MAITRE D': Dorsia.
BATEMAN: Umm...yes...I know it's a little late but is it possible to reserve a table for two at eight or eight-thirty perhaps?
COURTNEY: A facial at Elizabeth Arden, which was really relaxing, then to the Pottery Bam where I bought this silver muffin dish.
BATEMAN: Is that Donald Trump's car?
COURTNEY: Oh God, Patrick. Shut up.
BATEMAN: You know, Courtney, you should take some more lithium. Or have a Diet Coke. Some caffeine might get you out of this slump.
COURTNEY: I just want to have a child. Just...two... perfect...children...
BATEMAN: J&B. Straight.
COURTNEY: Champagne on the rocks. Oh-could I have that with a twist? She starts to sink back in her chair and Bateman leans over and pulls her back up.
COURTNEY: Are we here?
BATEMAN: Yes.
COURTNEY: This is Dorsia?
BATEMAN: Yes, dear.
BATEMAN: Courtney, you're going to have the peanut butter soup with smoked duck and mashed squash. New York magazine called it a 'playful but mysterious little dish. You'll love it. And then...the red snapper with violets and pine nuts. I think that'll follow nicely."
COURTNEY: Mmmm...thanks, Patrick.
