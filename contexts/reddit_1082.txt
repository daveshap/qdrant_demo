Getting out of bed is really hard for me. Is anyone else's anxiety worst in the morning?
My anxiety hits me the second I wake up. I feel awful and I have zero energy. I literally just want to lie in bed for the rest of the day. Waking up is hard for me in general. I have low blood pressure and I feel really groggy and dizzy when I wake up, so that makes getting out of bed even harder.

Once I do get up, eat,  have some water etc, I usually do feel better. But the problem is, mornings are hell for me, and some mornings my anxiety wins and I stay in bed till well past noon. 

Anyone have similar experiences, any tips?
