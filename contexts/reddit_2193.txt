I just applied to my first school!
My safety school has rolling admissions, but I didn’t know it opened this EARLY! I was just doing research on the school for my spreadsheet then i saw that the application was open and boom I applied on the spot (there aren’t any essays  for this school).

I’m so happy because I pretty sure I’ll hear back before school starts, so I can just start applying pretty much anywhere and have the peace of mind that I have at least somewhere to go to that I would still enjoy.

Edit: Thanks for all the support! I didn't know this post was going to blow up lol. I just wanted to tell people that might notice because my family doesn't seem to care.
