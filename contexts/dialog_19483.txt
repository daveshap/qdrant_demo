BIRDIE STEPTOE: 'Twas down at Cresap's Landing, Along the River Shore, Birdie Steptoe was a Pilot in the good old days of yore. Now he sets in his old wharf-boat...
JOHN HARPER: When'll Dad's skiff be ready?
BIRDIE STEPTOE: Can't hear ye, boy. ...So the big boats heave a sigh, They blow for Uncle Birdie...
JOHN HARPER: When'll the skiff be ready?
BIRDIE STEPTOE: And the times that are gone by. I'll have her ready inside of a week; and then we'll go fishin'. How's your Maw?
JOHN HARPER: O, she's all right.
BIRDIE STEPTOE: How's your sister Pearl?
JOHN HARPER: Just fine.
BIRDIE STEPTOE: Leavin', boy?
JOHN HARPER: Yep; gotta watch out for Pearl, Uncle Birdie.
BIRDIE STEPTOE: Well goodnight, boy. Come again -- any time.
