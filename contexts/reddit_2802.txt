What do you do outside of work to improve yourself or advance your career?
Many of you may have read a quote that says, "Don't work eight hours for a company, then go home and not work on your own goals. You're not tired, you're uninspired."

That has really stuck in my brain. As I'm currently in a good job that's getting me experience that I need, but is very much a stepping stone position, I know that I need to put in work outside of my 9-5 to eventually get where I want to be. That being said, I'm floundering a bit to find the right way to go about it.

What do you do outside of your "day job" that helps your improve yourself, gain measurable experience, or grow your network? How do you put in additional work to meet your career goals? Even if it's industry specific, I'd love to hear!
