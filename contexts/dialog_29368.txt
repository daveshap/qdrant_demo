WOODY: Hi ya, fellas. To infinity and beyond!
REX: Hey look! It's Buzz!
WOODY: Yeah, hey Buzz. Let's show the guys our new secret best-friends hand shake. Gimme five, man!
HAMM: Something's screwy here.
WOODY: So, you see? We're friends now, guys. Aren't we, Buzz? You bet. Gimme a hug.
WOODY: Ha, ha, oh, I love you, too.
SLINKY: See? It is Buzz. Now give back the lights, Potato Head.
MR. POTATO HEAD: Wait just a minute. What are you trying to pull?!
WOODY: Nothing.
HAMM: Oh, that is disgusting.
MR. POTATO HEAD: Murderer!
WOODY: No! No, no, no, no!
MR. POTATO HEAD: You murdering dog!
WOODY: No, it's not what you think, I swear!
MR. POTATO HEAD: Save it for the jury. I hope Sid pulls your voice-box out, ya creep!
WOODY: No! No! Don't leave! Don't leave! You've gotta help us, please! You don't know what it's like over here!
MR. POTATO HEAD: Come on. Let's get out of here.
