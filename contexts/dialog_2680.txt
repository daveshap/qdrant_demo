DELACROIX: Mantan, we got a show to tape.
MANTAN: My name is Manray, goddamnit.
DELACROIX: Kook and the Gang, it's Manray. Let's do the taping. You go back to your dressing room, get dressed and blacken up.
MANRAY: I'm not playin' myself no mo'.
DELACROIX: How you sound?
MANRAY: I won't do it anymore.
DELACROIX: Manray, I'm very sorry about ya boy Cheeba and Sloan. Believe me, it gave me no joy pulling ya coattail about her, just lookin' out for a brother. I feel you, all this stuff happenin' at once but you can't let if affect your work. You gotta be professional.
MANRAY: I'm always gonna be that. But I ain't doing no more buck dancing.
DELACROIX: No costume. No blackface.
