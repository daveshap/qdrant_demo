Return Flights and UK Standard Visitor Visa (for a minor) I am British and travelling home to Northern Ireland with my son, who is Bolivian and has been legally adopted in country (and that adoption is accepted in the UK). I'm applying to get him a UK Standard Visitor Visa but we're not sure exactly how long we'll be in the UK, and I would prefer to buy our return tickets when we're certain of a date. I know it's not necessary for the visa application, but I'm worried about immigration (which we'll do either in London Gatwick or Heathrow). If I have my bank statement showing that I can afford the return ticket, will that be okay? And how much will I need to show I can afford? Also, we'll live with my parents there, and I'll be working during the 6 months (which I legally can) - will they ask questions if there isn't a whole lot on top of the money for the return tickets?Thanks in advance!
