Creating a tolerance range for measuring performance Apologies for my ignorance, I've been trying to find an answer to my question but I think my understanding of statistical analysis is so rudimentary it has been confusing.I want to use a statistical method to determine what is an acceptable range of performance variance (actual vs forecast) for different products we forecast, modifying the acceptable range for different variables such as time of year, day of the week etc. I know I can use all types of variance modelling to determine what variables contribute to variances in forecast and are therefore significant. Do these models also assist in determining what are acceptable ranges of 'tolerance'? Is that what confidence intervals are? Thanks in advance.
