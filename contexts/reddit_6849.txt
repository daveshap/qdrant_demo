Getting laid off next week. How should I go about it?
So I'm getting laid off from an e-commerce company. My predecessor didn't leave me anything to work with when I first got the job, and now my manager wants me to stay 2 extra weeks to teach another person to run my code and help him understand how it works. I don't have a problem leaving them the code, but do feel very unmotivated to teach the other guy (no one taught me how to do my job). Added to this my severance they're giving me amounts to half a month of pay. How should I go about this? Has anyone been a similar situation?
