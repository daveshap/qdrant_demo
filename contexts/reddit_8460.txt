What is the accurate, unbiased history of the escalation of norms violation in the US Senate over judicial nominees?
There is a sense from both Democrats and Republicans that the other side “started it” when it comes to the escalation of partisan warfare over the norms in the Senate in the appointment and confirmation of federal judges.

For example, [these](https://www.sacbee.com/opinion/op-ed/article214394299.html) [articles](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/mitch-mcconnell-is-winning-the-long-game/2018/05/30/99b81818-6371-11e8-a768-ed043e33f1dc_story.html) blame Democrats for filibustering multiple Bush appellate and circuit court nominees beginning in 2001, attempting to pack the courts several years later under Obama, removing the filibuster when Republicans attempted to prevent that court packing, and finally attempting a filibuster of Gorsuch in 2017. Some date Democrats’ first escalation to the blocking of Robert Bork in 1987.

Democrats, on the other hand, [argue](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/05/mcconnell-stole-obamas-court-seats-and-gave-them-to-trump.html) that Obama wasn’t “packing” the circuit court in the sense of expanding its size so that it could be filled only with liberal justices, but rather simply attempted to fill vacancies with nominees whose qualifications Republicans never denied, and that with those circuit court nominees, as well as Merrick Garland’s nomination to the Supreme Court, Republicans took the unprecedented step of refusing on principle to allow *any* appointments, independent of any suggestion that they’re too extreme, as opposed to Democrats’ attempts merely to block the most extreme appointees.

What is the truth here? What is the complete timeline of escalations, along with the context necessary to evaluate that timeline fairly?
