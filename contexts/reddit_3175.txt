How do I negotiate salary when my responsibilities are doubling?
Double the work equals double the money, right? If only life were so simple.

I've been working an admin job in luxury real estate, but decided I wanted to take on more responsibility. I highlighted my design/marketing skills gained through my old advertising career to my boss, and he wants to make me the marketing point person for my branch while keeping all my current admin duties.

Since I'll be effectively working two full jobs, wouldn't it be reasonable to be compensated as such? Doubling my salary sounds ridiculous on paper, but I'm wondering what a good percentage increase I could realistically aim for. Any negotiating tactics would be appreciated too. Thanks!

Edit: Thanks so much for the replies everyone! It seems there's a split between proving my worth and asking for a raise sooner as to not be "working more for free." I'm leaning towards asking for a raise now with the thinking that if my company trusts me with these increased responsibilities, they should respect my efforts enough to compensate for them.
