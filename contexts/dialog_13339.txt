GABRIELLE: Well?
NATHAN: God, you're beautiful.
GABRIELLE: Please. I look a mess.
NATHAN: No. You look so beautiful.
GABRIELLE: Anyway. Come already to the point.
NATHAN: I'm... I'm going to leave Lila. I can't stop thinking about you.
GABRIELLE: I've moved on.
NATHAN: No!
GABRIELLE: I've been seeing Johannsen in chemistry.
NATHAN: That goddamn Neanderthal? I'm the one who gave him the idea for the combination bug spray-sun screen! Did you know that?!
GABRIELLE: That's not how he tells it.
NATHAN: Of course not, that Swedish thief! He's a thief of hearts! I love you, Gabrielle.
GABRIELLE: Hunh.
NATHAN: Just give me some time to let Lila down easily. She's a really nice girl and I don't want to hurt her more than is necessary.
GABRIELLE: You hurt me, you know, when you made Nathan's Choice. Does that not even matter to you, you pig?
