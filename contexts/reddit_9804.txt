What tools are good in making final exams schedules for students?
Hi I am an employer at a university. What are the best tools/ways on making efficient final exam schedules for students to avoid conflicts and other issues for students. Are there software to utilize from number of courses, number of students, and class rooms to generate schedules? 

I really can use some tips/hints.

Regards,
