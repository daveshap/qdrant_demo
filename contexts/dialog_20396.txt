FOLEY: Weren't you expecting us?
GLENN: That broad you picked up -- did you know she was a US Marshal, for Christ sake?
GLENN: She <i>knew</i> me from some bullshit dope bust. She drove me to court. Twice. You know what she said, we're in the car on the turnpike? I never forget anybody I've cuffed and shackled.""
FOLEY: Yeah? She said that to you?
FOLEY: What happened to your shades? Someone finally step on 'em?
GLENN: I don't know...
FOLEY: Whose blood you got all over you?
GLENN: These guys, man, they're crazy. Shit.
FOLEY: Is that Snoopy? In the purple doo rag?
BUDDY: What's he do now, tell fortunes?
WHITE BOY BOB: We have a problem here?
MAURICE: Jack Foley, famous bank robber.
FOLEY: Snoopy Miller, famous fight thrower.
MAURICE: It seems to me I been reading about you in the newspaper. Busted out of some joint in Florida, huh?
FOLEY: Low class of people there, Snoop.
