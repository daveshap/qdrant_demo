JACQUES: That's good.
ENZO: How do you make a living? Your experiments, does it pay well?
JACQUES: It's okay.
ENZO: ... You married?
JACQUES: No.
ENZO: Me neither, 'cause of my Mother. She's a curse, my Mamma, a tornado. Stubborn as a mule! I was engaged... for a week. After that, Mamma was so mad, I tell you, pasta was bouncing off the walls.
ENZO: So, not married. Well, good for you. You play the field, like me. A girl in every port, huh?
JACQUES: Exactly, I mean, after all, we're men!
ENZO: Damn right! That's what I tell them when people say you've turned into a fish.
JACQUES: People say that?
ENZO: Forget it. I was joking.
