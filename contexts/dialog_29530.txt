SYBOK: I trust your message was received?
KIRK: You can't expect us to stand by while you take the ship into the Great Barrier.
SYBOK: What you fear is the unknown. The people of your planet once believed their world was flat. Columbus proved it was round. They said the sound barrier could never be broken. It was broken. They said warp speed could not be achieved. The Great Barrier is the ultimate expression of this universal fear. It's an extension of personal fear. Captain Kirk, I so much want your understanding. I want your respect. Are you afraid to hear me out?
KIRK: I'm afraid of nothing.
