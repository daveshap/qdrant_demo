MARTIN: Am I supposed to know him?
LOMBARD: Six weeks ago. He bought a boy of yours.
MARTIN: Clients come and go.
LOMBARD: This one came back and was never seen again. I understand Friedman looked after him.
MARTIN: Huh, I doubt it... Friedman only deals directly with select customers. I handle the rabble...
LOMBARD: Where is Friedman?
MARTIN: Look, I don’t think you’re fully aware of what you’re playing with here, Mister. Whoever put you up to this either pays too well or misinformed you. Why don’t you just tell me what it is you want so we can do business in a civilized manner, eh?
