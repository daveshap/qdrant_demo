Is it rude to not answer managers work related questions when manager wont give me hours during quarantine?
So I work at a dental office as reception and we shut down about a month and a half ago due to Covid, since then obviously our hours have been cut except for our manager. 

Every single day I get texts or calls asking work related questions as to how to do something or to do a report and one time I was even stuck on a 1 hour call to guide her on how to do something, one day I just didn't respond to her as she refused to count my hours for help so she ended up reaching out to one of my co-workers who she knows i'm close with and ask her why i'm not responding...

&#x200B;

My question is, is it rude of me or can I get in trouble for me not responding to her if she's refusing to give me hours (i'm hourly, not salary) She knows i'm more than willing to go in for a couple hours, she just doesn't want to pay us.

EDIT: I shouldn’t say I completely “ignore” my manager, she knows why I don’t reply to her her, I usually end up replying kind of vague by saying it’s very hard to teach over text or phone or not right away. I’ve asked a few times how to clock in my hours and I always get a “I’ll get back to you” or she dismisses it and now I’m feeling like I’m being taken advantage of.
