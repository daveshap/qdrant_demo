Is anyone else working a part time job while in grad school?
I recently started working a new part time job at a cafe literally 2 blocks from my office. I love my staff and coworkers, I'm making pretty decent money, and the proximity to campus can't be beat. I started working because my apartment complex is insanely more expensive then I originally thought, and I need some extra cash for some things my stipend isn't covering given my current living situation. I'm moving to a cheaper place over the summer (thank god), but I think I'll keep the job for a few more months to start racking up my savings and putting money toward my student loans. I worked two jobs all throughout college, but I'm a little anxious thinking about balancing this one with all my grad work. We'll see how it goes. 

Is anyone else working a job? How is it going?
