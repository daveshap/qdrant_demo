AHHHHH I HATE MYSELF!!! I LEGIT LIVE 20 MINS AWAY FROM DC AND COULD HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF SO MANY INTERNSHIPS BUT I CANT BECAUSE IM ONLY A PERMANENT RESIDENT AND NOT A CITIZEN!! I CANT APPLY FOR A GOVERNMENT INTERNSHIP OR FOR NASA OR FOR ANYTHING IM INTERESTED IN AHHHHHH!!!
It just SUCKS because I’m so fricking privileged to live in a place with soooo many opportunities to take advantage of and I can’t! Stupid green card gives me noooo street cred without being a citizen.

I know I’m not competitive enough to actually get a DC internship or to intern with NASA but I’d like the opportunity to at least *try*. I never realized how disadvantaged being interested in political science/public policy is without being a citizen. I feel like I’m just realizing this major isn’t going to be sustainable for me to pursue in college if I can’t actually get DC political experiences as I probably won’t get my citizenship in time.

LOL okay rant over, this post is the definition of first world problems *cringe*
