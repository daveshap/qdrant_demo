MATHILDA: How many girlfriends did you have?
LEON: ...I don't know.
MATHILDA: Well... 1... 2... 10... 100... 1000? How many, approximately?
LEON: ...Mathilda, I don't feel like talking about this.
MATHILDA: Why? Did you have too many and you fear it may shock me? I won't get shocked. I'm used to this! My father was a true pig. He fucked the bitch I'd as mother all around the apartment. Whenever a door was closed, you could be sure they were making sex behind it! And my sister, if you didn't sleep with her, you're building's exception!
LEON: Stop, Mathilda! Don't talk like that!
