WADE: Aw, shit, she's here to get Jill. Me and Jill had a little argument. Jack, I got to get back, get back to town. Move this thing, will you? See if you can get back to the Town Hall before they get there, okay?
JACK: Piece of fucking cake.
WADE: Lillian!

WADE: Me and Jill, we just had a little spat. She felt kind of left out, I guess, from not knowing some of the new kids --
LILLIAN: Where is she now? Is she in the truck with your friends?
