I hope this is helpful for someone
Therapist of 22 years here. I've been reading many posts this afternoon and I'm hoping I can provide at least one person some relief. If so, it's been worth it. 

Depression is a bitch. It's not something you snap out of or get over. It's not just being in a bad mood for a day or two. It's pervasive and complicated and takes a unique approach of coping for every individual. 

I've compiled a list of 50 strategies for coping with depression and anxiety. You can read it [**HERE.**](https://gr8fultherapist.com/2019/11/01/50-powerful-strategies-for-coping-with-anxiety-and-depression/) **These are strategies based on  my years of experience with clients as well as the input of other therapists who shared strategies that worked for them.**

Another article that people have found very helpful and has been clicked on a lot is the one on changing negative thinking. Check it out [**HERE.**](https://gr8fultherapist.com/2019/08/03/changenegativethinking/) **I worked hard to create a resource that will give you 8 Steps to Change Negative Thinking that REALLY WORK.** 

Please let me know if this is helpful!
