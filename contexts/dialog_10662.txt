MURPHY: Take it easy, you'll live longer.
EPPS: Did you see him?
MURPHY: Who?
EPPS: The guy. He just came this way.
MURPHY: What guy?
EPPS: There's somebody else on this boat.
MURPHY: What? What the hell're you talking about.
EPPS: I saw him. Just a minute ago. Some guy.
MURPHY: Are you sure?
EPPS: Of course I'm sure. I saw him.
MURPHY: You sure it wasn't me?
EPPS: It wasn't you. It was somebody else. There's somebody else aboard.
DODGE: Light in those passages ain't so good.
EPPS: I'm telling you, I saw somebody. I don't know who it was. But I saw somebody.
GREER: What'd he look like?
EPPS: Maybe six feet. Lanky. I didn't get a good look. He was far away. But I saw him. I saw him as sure as you're standing there.
DODGE: Where's his boat, then? Where's his crew? He ain't gonna be out here by himself, that's for damn sure.
GREER: She's so big somebody could come alongside her on the other side and we'd never know it.
EPPS: Maybe that is his boat.
DODGE: Gimme a break.
MURPHY: If somebody's aboard her already, she ain't ours. She's theirs.
DODGE: Bullshit. That boat hasn't made steam for fifty years. We found her. She's ours.
MURPHY: Not in the eyes of the law.
EPPS: So, we find this guy and make a deal with him.
MURPHY: We don't exactly have the best bargaining position.
DODGE: I say fuck the motherfucker. We're a professional salvage crew going about our business. What's some yahoo doing way out here by himself anyway?
MURPHY: And what do you propose? That we knock this guy off?
DODGE: Why not? Why the fuck not?
DODGE: Fifty million dollars. Fifty million. We gonna let this guy just take it from us? One guy?
EPPS: So we kill him?
DODGE: I'm saying we gotta do whatever we gotta do to preserve our interest.
GREER: I don't know.
MURPHY: Let's just take it easy here, alright? Nobody's gonna kill anybody.
GREER: Supposing he wants to get bad with us?
DODGE: One guy isn't gonna be so stupid.
EPPS: Maybe he isn't alone.
GREER: I say we off-load some of that gold now.
MURPHY: Would you hold on just a minute here, please? Look, there's no reason to panic now. Epps saw somebody. Fine. It's a big boat. Chances're real good he doesn't even know about the gold. If we stay cool, nobody'll be the wiser. The gold stays where it is til we're ready to go. Like I said, it'll be a hell of a lot safer there than here.
DODGE: What if that fucker finds it before we're ready to go?
MURPHY: We'll stand a watch. Four on, eight off. Low man first.
EPPS: Guess that'd be me. Again.
MURPHY: Dodge, get on that turbine. I don't care if you don't sleep for a week. The sooner you're done, the sooner we can get out of here. How's the food situation?
GREER: Pretty low all around.
MURPHY: We'll have to take it easy then. I don't think we'll find much aboard the ship, but it's probably worth looking around.
