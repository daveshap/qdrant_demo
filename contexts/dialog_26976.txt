COUNSELOR: No money, no identification or passport. You are in a fix. What did happen to you?
NICHOLAS: Well, where to begin. It's complicated...
COUNSELOR: It always is.
NICHOLAS: What happened was, I'm on vacation, alone... I was robbed, at gunpoint. They hit me and ran. Two men, a few blocks away. They took my wallet, money... all of it. So...
COUNSELOR: Robbed?
NICHOLAS: Yes.
COUNSELOR: Have you gone to the police?
NICHOLAS: I don't speak Spanish. All I need is to get back... just enough for that.
COUNSELOR: We'll help with the police, if you want to bother. As far as money goes... can I make a suggestion? You say you were mugged?
NICHOLAS: Yes.
COUNSELOR: And, they didn't take that watch?
COUNSELOR: How much is it? A few thousand, at least. A Rolex like that... lucky for you they missed it.
NICHOLAS: Yes, very lucky.
