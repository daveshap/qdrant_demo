BOBBY: You Harlin?
DARRELL: Nope. Darrell.
BOBBY: Harlin around?
DARRELL: He's up at the Look Out.
BOBBY: Will he be back soon?
DARRELL: Doubt it. He's dead. The Look Out's a cemetery.
BOBBY: You own this place?
DARRELL: Yep.
BOBBY: Then why do you call it Harlin's?
DARRELL: 'Cause Harlin used to own it.
BOBBY: But he's dead.
DARRELL: So?
BOBBY: You want to take a look at my car? I think the radiator hose is--
DARRELL: Damn. Gonna be another hot one today. Sometimes I don't even want to get out of bed. Course don't want to get out for the cold one's neither. Then of course the clouds come in...
BOBBY: Look, Harlin, I've got places to be.
DARRELL: Darrell--
BOBBY: OK. Darrell... Could you just take a look at my radiator hose. It's busted.
BOBBY: So?
DARRELL: It's your radiator hose. It's busted.
BOBBY: I know it's busted. What did I just tell you?
DARRELL: Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?
BOBBY: If I could do you think I'd be standing here wasting my time. Can you fix it, or do I have to go somewhere else?
DARRELL: Somewhere else? Mister, somewhere else is fifty miles from here. Only other gas station down in town closed 3 years ago when the mine got shut...
BOBBY: Okay, I'm stuck. You happy? Now can you fix it, or not?
DARRELL: Yeah, I can fix it.
BOBBY: Great!
DARRELL: Gotta run over to the yard and see if I can find a hose like this one, or close enough. Gonna take time.
BOBBY: How much time?
DARRELL: Time.
DARRELL: Twenty-after-ten.
BOBBY: Jesus. Twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already.
DARRELL: Ninety-two. Course half hour from now might be seventy-two. These clouds move around a lot.
