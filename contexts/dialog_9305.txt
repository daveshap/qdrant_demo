SPICOLI: Something happened to them, mon.
BRAD: Come on, Spicoli. Why don't you just put your shirts back on? See the sign?
DENNIS: Any problems?
BRAD: No, just a couple of surfers with no shirts on. I took care of it, Dennis.
DENNIS: Did you throw away those fries, Hamilton?
BRAD: They were left over from the last shift.
DENNIS: Those were perfectly good fries, Hamilton. Perfectly good.
BRAD: But they weren't mine.
STACY: He gave me his card. 'Ron Johnson, Audio Consultant.'
LINDA: Should we buy a frame for that?
STACY: Come on, Linda, I haven't had a boyfriend all summer. You promised when I started working at the mall that my life would change... Do you think he'll call this week?
LINDA: Listen, Stace, you want to know about guys? I'll tell you. They're mostly chicken. Before I met Doug I chased after every guy I thought was cute. I thought if I gave out a vibe they'd get the message and call me up. Well, guess what? They don't call.
STACY: So what did you do?
LINDA: I called them. If I was sitting next to a guy and I wanted to sit closer, I'd sit closer. If I wanted to kiss him, I'd just do it. You want Ron Johnson? Grab him.
STACY: I can't do that.
LINDA: Face it. With some guys you have to make the first move. A lot of guys are just... wussies.
STACY: Really?
LINDA: Stacy, what are you waiting for? You're fifteen. I did it when I was thirteen. It's no huge thing. It's just sex. If you don't, one of the other girls will.
STACY: He was hot, wasn't he?
LINDA: If I didn't have a fianc√© in Chicago, I'd go for it.
GIRL: Are you Linda Barrett?
LINDA: Yes.
GIRL: I'm Carrie Frazier from Toys 'R Us. Judy Hinton from May Company told me I could ask you something.
