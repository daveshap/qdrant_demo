DEIRDRE: I feel as if I've wandered onto the set of Enter The Dragon. Could you teach me to do that?
SAM: I didn't think to see you again tonight. You were pretty pissed.
DEIRDRE: I still am.
SAM: Is that right?
DEIRDRE: That's right.
SAM: Part of me says I should just look at this as a perk. You know, a bonus. But then I remember you're you -- Deirdre who used to belong to the IRA -- and it occurs to me that deceit and subterfuge come very naturally to you.
DEIRDRE: Nobody's saying they don't.
SAM: And when I consider that, I have to wonder if you don't have some ulterior motive for being here, with me, right now.
DEIRDRE: I probably do. But for the time being, I'm willing to forget about it...
GREGOR: I would imagine that the great satisfaction in all of this will be killing the American.
SWEDE: I hadn't thought about it. Understand me, Gregor -- I take no pleasure in killing. It doesn't bother me one bit, but I don't get off on it.
GREGOR: A means to an end, is that it?
SWEDE: That's it.
GREGOR: Then I guess we're set.
SWEDE: There is one other thing...
GREGOR: What's that?
GREGOR: What are you doing?
SWEDE: Don't cross me...
GREGOR: Nobody's going to do that!
SWEDE: Really?
GREGOR: I need you, Swede, I can't do this without you!
SWEDE: I just wanted to make sure you knew who you were dealing with.
GREGOR: I do, I do...
