CHARLIE CLARK: Yeah, that works out.
NICKY: But how much cash could I bury in my closet, right?
CHARLIE CLARK: You need to understand, and I - I'm sure you do... that in a venture of this kind, you have to be prepared to take some kind of loss.
NICKY: Oh, listen, I understand that there's always a risk... you know, I might have to take a loss somewhere.
NICKY: So I put some of the money into legitimate deals with Charlie Clark. He was Ace's banker.
NICKY: I mean, you will try to push it through, won't you, Mr Clark?
CHARLIE CLARK: Yes.
NICKY: Well, you gotta understand, I'm giving you fifty thousand cash.
