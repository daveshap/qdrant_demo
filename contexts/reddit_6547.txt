Is $12 an hour a good starting salary offer?
Hi I’m a recent college graduate with two bachelors degrees and a certification in business. i don’t have a ton of prior work experience, but I had a summer internship and a part time college job. I have been looking for work, and found a part time position at a hospital with a pay of $12 an hour, with the potential for a 4% increase after a year of work.
I’m not sure whether for my qualifications this is appropriate pay. I wanted $15 an hour so I’m a little disappointed. However it’s been difficult finding positions that will accept a new graduate. Should I accept the offer or is it not enough for the pay? I’m trying to gauge. 

Thanks!
