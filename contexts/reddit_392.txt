I cant sleep
About 2 days ago whilst me and my mom wore on the way home from the store her car engine cut out we managed to pull over beside the fast lane my mom told me to climb into the back seat on the side opposite  the road  as we thought it was safer she had me keep look look threw the back window for any cars that get to close to wave them down   but there  was a guy in a van on his phone and he didnt see us until the very last second until he swerved away taking put wing mirror along with him it was so close to a almost fatal crash as this guy was going well over 100 mph but last night when I went to sleep anytime I close my eyes all I can  see is the van coming straight at us it's so scary I don't  no what to do I was honestly fearing for my life for those two hours until the tow truck came I just cant seen to forget about it
