What can an introvert do to feel comfortable socialising in a corporate work environment?
Starting my first job soon in a corporate environment (bank) and I’m worried about whether I’d be able to get along with my colleagues and bosses. I know many pick up smoking as a way to get to know colleagues & bosses, or flow with the in crowd but I don’t smoke and don’t intend to. 

What else can I do in this competitive environment where connections and relationships are so important?
