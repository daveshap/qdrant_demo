PEGGY: What does Grandma think you do at your meetings?
BARNEY: Stag movies. Smokers.
BARNEY: I may be an old fool, but I think we can help you.
PEGGY: I hope so. At least I got to see you and Grandma. Has it ever worked before?
BARNEY: The last one was six hundred years ago. It's about time for another one.
