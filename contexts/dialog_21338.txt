UTAH: I can barely do this in broad daylight.
TYLER: Come on. At least no one's gonna see how bad you are.
UTAH: I gotta be fucking crazy.
BODHI: Yeah, but are you crazy enough?
BODHI: Football's a man-made game. You keep score with numbers. But in this, there's no field, no rules, no opponent. Just you and the wave.
UTAH: I know that part. Tell me something I can use, here.
BODHI: I've watched you once or twice. You surf like it's some kind of street fight. You jerk along from moment to moment, fighting everything that comes at you. Always trying to win.
UTAH: A flaw I'm working on.
BODHI: The only way to win out here is to surrender. You have to feel what the wave is doing, accept its energy, get in sync. Just feel it all moving in the blackness... you don't need to see.
UTAH: Yeah, right, vision is highly over- rated.
