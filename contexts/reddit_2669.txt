People who jumped from a stable and good work environment to pursue a higher salary and prestige, how did that go for you?
Currently residing in a small company that has a great work culture with an ok salary. Now have the opportunity to jump to a more corporate environment with a higher pay, opportunity to learn/specialize and essentially launch my career. 

The current job is like the perfect retirement job that i found too early and its really hard because im torn out of my desire to forward my career and earnings and losing something good.
