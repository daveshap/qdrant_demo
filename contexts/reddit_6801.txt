Is this email appropriate to send to a recruiter?
I received a business card for a recruiter from someone i know. Is this an appropriate introduction email? Should I elaborate on my job experience/skills?

  

Hello "Blank",

My name is "Blank", I received your business card through a mutual acquaintance "Blank" after informing her that I am looking for new employment. I'm a motivated team player with over 2 years of experience in office administration and am pursuing a degree in computer science. Attached is a copy of my resume.

thanks,

"Blank"
