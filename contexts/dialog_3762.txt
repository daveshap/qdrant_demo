RACHAEL: Did you cry when your father died?
DECKARD: Yeah.
RACHAEL: That's another thing I can't do.
RACHAEL: Nobody is freer than when he dreams. I read that.
DECKARD: It wasn't very good last night, was it?
RACHAEL: I don't know, I have nothing to compare it to. I guess I thought there was something more to it.
DECKARD: What?
RACHAEL: I don't know... I think I missed something.
DECKARD: Like?
RACHAEL: I'm not sure. Is there a secret?
