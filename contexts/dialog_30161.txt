KUJAN: Heartwarming. Really, I feel weepy.
VERBAL: You wanted to know what happened after the line-up, I'm telling you.
KUJAN: Oh come on, Verbal. Who do you think you're talking to? You really expect me to believe he retired? For a woman? Bullshit. He was using her.
VERBAL: He loved her.
KUJAN: Sure. And I'm supposed to believe that hitting the Taxi Service wasn't his idea
VERBAL: That was all Fenster and McManus.
KUJAN: Come on. Keaton was a cop for four years. Who else would know the Taxi Service
VERBAL: You keep trying to lay this whole ride on t Keaton. It wasn't like that. Sure he knew, but Edie had him all turned around. r I'm telling you straight, I swear. +
KUJAN: Let me tell you something. I know Dean Keaton. I've been investigating him for three years. The guy I know is a cold- + blooded bastard. L.A.P.D. indicted him on three counts of murder before he was kicked off the force, so don't sell me the hooker with the heart of gold. +
VERBAL: You got him wrong.
KUJAN: Do I? Keaton was under indictment a total + of seven times when he was on the force. + In every case, witnesses either reversed + their testimony to the grand jury or died + before they could testify. When they t finally did nail him for fraud, he spent + five years in Sing Sing. He killed three prisoners inside - one with a knife in the tailbone while he strangled him to death. Of course I can't prove this but I can't prove the best part either.
