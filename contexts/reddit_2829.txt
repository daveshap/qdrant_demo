What can a 27F who wasted her time do to start her career?
I was a very studies person and I graduated from a good universityin India 3 years back. I have a few 2-3 months internship experience and that is all. Just after my graduation I started preparing for an exam full-time, this exam is a big deal in my country. I did that for 2 years , never cleared it. But then I freaked out and decided I needed to find a job. All this while I had a partner supporting me. Earlier this year we moved to a new country which made things worse for me as the field I want to work to (social sciences research/development sector) is very competitive in this region, 9 months and I haven't found a job. I am really not able to make a decision and I am getting suicidal thoughts often. I tried to think about it rationally and here are few options I have.

1) Go back to my native country and look for work their even though it is low paying. (This way J won't be able to support my family, which I really want to)

2)Be patient and keep on searching in my new city. (Even though opportunities are rare, if I make it is will be big for me financially and career wise)

3) My partner has plans to move to again to a different country. (While I would want to follow him for emotional reasons, I am scared the history will repeat, where I will end unemployed again for 4th consecutive year!)

4) Is my career gap a reason why I am not hired anywhere?

Please please provide a constructive opinion/advice/suggestion.
Believe me I am not a lazy ass, I have made a few mistake like preparing for an exam for straight 2 years, wasting my time leaving a huge career gap) 

Any help would been a lot to me, thanks.
