COTTON: You know the story, Gale. Man falsely accused, sent to prison, proved innocent, released back into the real world and never trusted again. Want the exclusive?
GALE: Did you do it?
COTTON: Now, Gale, you were so instrumental in my freedom. You're not having character doubts now, are you?
GALE: You have a right to be angry.
COTTON: No, Gale, I don't have any rights. You made sure of that.
GALE: Cotton, I've done nothing but help you.
COTTON: You've done nothing but get rich off of me. How many books have you sold, Gale? You think I don't understand points and royalties and ancilliary rights?
GALE: Don't do anything stupid, Cotton. You've come to far.
COTTON: Gale, I don't know what I'm doing from one moment to the next. I'm just taking it as it comes.
