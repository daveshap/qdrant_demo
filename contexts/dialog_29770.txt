ALABAMA: Wow. What a swell place to work.
CLARENCE: Yeah, I got the key, so I come here at night, hang out, read comic books, play music.
ALABAMA: How long have you worked here?
CLARENCE: Almost four years.
ALABAMA: That's a long time.
CLARENCE: I'm hip. But you know, I'm comfortable here. It's easy work. I know what I'm doing. Everybody who works here is my buddy. I'm friendly with most of the customers. I just hang around and talk about comic books all day.
ALABAMA: Do you get paid a lot?
CLARENCE: That's where trouble comes into paradise. But the boss let's you borrow some money if you need it. Wanna see what Spiderman" number one looks like?"
ALABAMA: You bet. How much is that worth?
CLARENCE: Four hundred bucks.
ALABAMA: I didn't even know they had stores that just sold comic books.
CLARENCE: Well, we sell other things too. Cool stuff. Man from U.N.C.L.E." Lunch boxes. "Green Hornet" board games. Shit like that. But comic books are main business. There's a lot of collectors around here."
ALABAMA: What's that?
CLARENCE: That's a Rookies" doll. George Sanford Brown. We gotta lotta dolls. They're real cool. Did you know they came out with dolls for all the actors in "The Black Hole"? I always found it funny somewhere there's a kid playin' with a little figure of Earnest Borgnine."
