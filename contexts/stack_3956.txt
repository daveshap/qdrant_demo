About RNN with variable length output vectors I have several thousands samples with equal number of features (5000, they are time dependent) and I would like to predict of vectors with variable length.1) I'm beginner in RNN, and I'd like to know if there are the approaches except zero padding, when we have vector with variable length.2) 5000 features are normal? Or it isn't suitable number of features for RNN (namely LSTM), because 5000 is too big
