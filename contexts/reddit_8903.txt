The US government has shut down. Let's discuss.
Neutrons,

There have been many submissions in the last 24 hours about the [US government shutdown,](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/01/us/politics/congress-shutdown-debate.html?_r=0) but none of them conformed to [this subreddit's guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines), so they got removed.

Here's a post with the best points from each. Please try to keep the discussion civil.

There's a lot of arguing about who is at fault for the shutdown. In the interest of neutrality, I think it's fair to say there's plenty of blame to go around *(edit: there's been some contention on this point, so [here's is a better explanation](http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/1nio4r/the_us_government_has_shut_down_lets_discuss/ccizswk?context=1) of the reasoning)*, so instead, let's explore what the different forces hoped to accomplish by letting it get to this point and whether they have succeeded. [Who stands to gain and lose](http://nbcpolitics.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/09/23/20663446-obama-cruz-among-those-who-could-benefit-from-shutdown?lite) from the shutdown, both politically and in the general population? And what does the evidence suggest about the long-term effects of this event?

Is it reasonable for the people to pursue removal or recall of legislators who failed to appropriate funds in time to avoid a shutdown of the government? How might they go about that?

Is there a real possibility that the government could [fail to raise the debt ceiling next month,](http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/30/how-a-debt-ceiling-crisis-could-become-a-financial-crisis/) leading to a US default on its debt obligations?

This is a touchy subject, so if you're going to make assertions in the comments below, please be sure to support them with evidence by citing a qualified source.

As a side note, we had [a lively discussion prior to the shutdown too.](http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/1muhz0/what_are_the_ramifications_of_a_us_government/)
