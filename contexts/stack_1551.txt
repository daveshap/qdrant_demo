10MHz Sine Wave Generator I have been looking for some time for a good design for a ~10MHz sine wave generator, with variable frequency from about 5-20MHz. The max required peak to peak amplitude is 10V. Many suggestions on the internet include using DDS such as AD9833, however, that feels like overkill for what I need. I have also seen a similar question to this, however, their application requires an extremely wideband (1-200MHz).I am using this as a Local Oscillator, which I am mixing with an error signal.Preferably, I would like to use a simple, cheap circuit design involving op-amps, with &lt;5% distortion. However if there is a better design, I am all ears.
