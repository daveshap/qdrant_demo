CHILI: What kinda food they serve at this Ivy place anyway?
KAREN: Continental, but it doesn't matter. Martin won't order from the menu.
CHILI: Why not?
KAREN: Because a movie star can never order straight from the menu. They have to think of something they have to have that isn't on the menu.
KAREN: Harry, what're you doing? You're supposed to be in the hospital.
CHILI: Yeah, Harry, you look like you belong in one of your horror movies.
