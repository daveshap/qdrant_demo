FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Yes?
RICKY: Yeah, uh, what's the movie?
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: It's in your copy of Hemispheres. I believe it's Mickey Blue Eyes.
RICKY: Ugh...
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: I'll get you the list of videos, if you don't mind, I'll offer the other passengers a beverage.
RICKY: Yeah, sure. How much are they?
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: How much is what?
RICKY: The videos.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: You're up front. Everything's free up here.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Yes?
RICKY: Drinks are free, right?
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Yes. Would you care for another one?
RICKY: Yes.
