ADELE: You took this picture?
CARRIE: Took 'em all.
CARRIE: That's me.
ADELE: No it is not!
CARRIE: Hold still.
ADELE: Sorry. Boy I'll tell ya, if Early found a picture of me like that I'd be black and blue for a week.
CARRIE: You shouldn't let him do that to you...
ADELE: Do what?
CARRIE: Adele... are you serious?
ADELE: You think Early's bad to me, don't you?
CARRIE: Yeah.
