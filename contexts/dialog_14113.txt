ELLIE: Where's the bus to New York?
GUARD: Left twenty minutes ago.
ELLIE: Why, that's ridiculous! I was on that busâ€”I told them to wait!
GUARD: Sorry, Miss. It's gone. Ellie's face clouds. The crowds surge about her. She looks around thoughtfully. Suddenly her eyes open in surprise at something she sees, and the VIEW then moves over to Peter, who sits on his suitcase, looking toward Ellie.
