BEEFY: My name's Beefy. I'm an old friend of your father's. He's asked me to help you out.
NICKY: I just need to find my brothers and be on my way, Beefy.
BEEFY: It's not gonna be easy. Your brothers can possess people. So they probably won't look like themselves. You have to be suspicious of everyone.
NICKY: Okay, bro
BEEFY: It's not me, moron.
NICKY: Oh. Sorry.
