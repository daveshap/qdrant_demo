MITCHELL: Sorry, Dick. She's a little tipsy.
NIXON: You mean smashed! She called up at midnight last week. Talking a bunch of crap. Pat can't stand her.
MITCHELL: It's a thing she does. She talks at night.
NIXON: Talks all day, too! How the hell can you put up with her, John?
MITCHELL: What the hell -- I love her. And she's great in bed.
