Will turning down a position after an interview hurt my chances of being hired if I apply again in the future?
To make a VERY VERY long story short, I love my coworkers but I'm not being paid enough. I just got an interview with my dream workplace for tomorrow morning. If my current workplace is able to match their pay and I turned down the position, would they consider me in the future if I re-applied? I'm sure this may vary from workplace to workplace, but I'm wondering if there's a "generally, yes" or "generally, no" answer that might give me some guidance.
