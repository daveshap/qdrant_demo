Im probably going to get beaten the fuck out of tomorrow what do i do?

Hi, i just turned 14 and i have been manipulated by someone for over a couple of years now and i can’t do anything against him because he has like a gang or something. So let’s get on with the story He made me buy him brand new air force 1’s and what i got in return was some used nike air max 270’s it was those were it said allah in arabic. (He is muslim) I didn’t really mind bc there just shoes, and i know they cost more but they were probably just stolen. The nike shoes didn’t even fit me. (This was some weeks ago) forward to today, he called me and said that he needed them back i said no because it wasn’t even his shoes anymore. He said he needed the to get something for himself.He tried to lie to me by saying that his mom wanted them back so i asked to speak with her. She said that it was you’re choice to keep them or not and he didn’t really like that too much. And now he is saying that he needs them back bc it says Allah on them and he will do anything for Allah to get those shoes back. He said that him and older people are going to jump so i don’t know what to do
