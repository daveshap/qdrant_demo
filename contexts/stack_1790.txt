percision timing ratio of multiple lights blinking with different durations and intervals I'm learning a lot of this as I go, my background is mostly in programming.  I'm trying to setup a timing circuit for two sets of lights going into a model, and am trying to determine the best way to go about it. The setup is this: The first light set starts on, then goes off at 0.5s then stays off for 1s.  The second set of lights come on for 0.025s in the middle of the on and off periods of the first lights so on at 0.25 sec for 0.025s and then again at 1s.I've done some rough prototyping using a 555 oscillator, a digital counter, and logic gates to hard code the timing for the shorter strobe lights. I know I can hard-code a sequential logic for the longer lights, but that seems as it would take up a bit of real estate using just straight logic gates. I've considered possibly using a programmable logic array or FPGA to handle the logic for the counter output, but don't know enough about either to know which would work best.Ideally I want to avoid using an Arduino unless I can put a small processor on the board instead. I need to keep the design as compact as I can since it will be installed inside some very tight spaces inside a model.The overall timing period of the lights can change a little, the key is the ratio between the two.I've looked around and found questions here about 1 set of lights with verying timing, but not a situation like I have here. Any help or suggestions is much appreciated.
