ETHAN: There it is, guys, the last of it.
AMBROSE: Yep. You've provided us with a golden opportunity to have both the bug and the bug killer.
ETHAN: What was the top bid?
AMBROSE: Why, you going to make me a better offer?
ETHAN: Than thirty-seven million pounds? Not really.
AMBROSE: Somebody's been slipping you our mail. Come on out here, you bad girl.
ETHAN: She doesn't belong here, Sean. Let her go.
AMBROSE: She wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you, Hunt. from this moment you're responsible for what happens to her, and if you're looking out for her well-being, I suggest you advise her to pick up the gun and bring it to me. Ball's in your court, Hunt. What've you got to say? Nyah's waiting for your answer.
