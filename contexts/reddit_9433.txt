For anybody who needs to deal with menstruation and either can't afford or just wants to save money on pads:
This is a video for you! It details how to hand sew cloth menstrual pads with a button to attach the flaps to your underwear. You can get fabric scraps for SUPER cheap either at walmart or at Joann's. She shows you how to do all the stitches she uses in the video and tells you exactly what to get for them.
