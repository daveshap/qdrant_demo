18(f) road trip with Bf (18)
So this summer , I am planning to go on a road trip with my boyfriend. I’ve been together with him for about a year now . My parents don’t want me to go on this trip at all . It is a road trip to California . work a part time job and have been saving up for this trip . They don’t let me hang out with anyone ever . I have a car , so I tell them I have work and hang out with him . I really wish I didn’t have to lie to them . Anyways , I was wondering if I went on the trip in the summer , could they call the cops on me and do something ? Like I’m 18 and all , but I want to know what could happen . I plan to just tell them the day of I’m leaving for the trip and leave . I’m sure there’ll be consequences when I come back home that I will deal with later. 

(They don’t like the idea of me having a boyfriend at all . I’m Burmese and he’s Chinese . His family accepts me but my parents only want me to marry someone they want me to marry . They tried to make me talk to a guy they wanted me to marry on Facebook that’s from my home country . I deleted my Facebook account so I didn’t have to talk to him . I do plan to move out when I have a stable place to live . There’s always my boyfriends place if I ever got kicked out but I don’t want to live with him for long periods of time yet . I feel like that’s too much at a young age )
