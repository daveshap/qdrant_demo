ADAM: Where are we going?
EVE: We? I'm going home. And, judging by that coat, I'd say you have to get back to the barber college.
ADAM: No, I'm lost.
EVE: You're lost?
ADAM: Say,...did you just lose your job because of me?
EVE: Forget it. I'm sick of working for that dickhead.
ADAM: Dickhead?
EVE: A walking penis capable of intelligent speech. A dickhead.
EVE: What's wrong with you?
ADAM: I just had a mental picture of...
EVE: Here, pick these up!
ADAM: I came on a bus.
EVE: Why doesn't that surprise me?
ADAM: I don't know. Why doesn't it?
EVE: Well, I guess because I'm a little psychic...I have this thing.
ADAM: Oh, that's nice.
EVE: Let me guess something. This is your first visit to La La Land. You're staying somewhere over in Hollywood because, like an idiot, you thought that would be an exciting place to stay. Right so far?
ADAM: So far?
EVE: Yes, I'm right?
ADAM: Right.
EVE: I knew it! So anyhow, you get on a bus and before you know it, you're out here in the San Fernando Valley without a clue. Which brings us to here. Correct again?
ADAM: Again.
EVE: Where are you staying? The Holiday Inn?
ADAM: Yes! Yes! The Holiday Inn! That's exactly right!
EVE: See? I'm psychic. Not completely, but pretty much. That was pretty good, wasn't it?!
ADAM: It was amazing.
EVE: Yeah. Thanks. Anyhow, let me predict a bus for you to get on.
ADAM: Do you own a car?
EVE: I'm not taking you there, Sweetie. Rule Number One in North America: No strangers in the car.
ADAM: If it will make you feel any better, I don't have a gun.
EVE: You don't?
ADAM: Nope.
EVE: Well, that changes everything. Get the fuck away from me!! I mean it!!
ADAM: I'm sorry! I said something wrong, didn't I! Please forgive me!
EVE: Get away from me!!
ADAM: Wait! Please wait! I'll make a deal with you! I'll give you a Rogers Hornsby, if you'll take me to the hotel!
EVE: Rogers Hornsby?!?
ADAM: He's all yours. I was holding him back.
EVE: Rogers Hornsby's worth like four thousand dollars!
ADAM: So what?! I've got two of him! And this many DiMaggios and Robinsons. I was holding these out, too.
EVE: So for four thousand dollars, all I have to do is drive you to your hotel?
ADAM: Yes.
EVE: And that's it?
ADAM: Yes.
EVE: I don't have to take a physical in your space ship?
ADAM: Heck, no! What?!
EVE: Okay. What the hell? You got a deal. Get in.
EVE: So...Mister Andretti, your first time on the freeway?
ADAM: It's Webber. Adam Webber.
EVE: Mind if I change the station? Better traffic reports on AM.
ADAM: Wait! Wait!
EVE: What is it?!
ADAM: It's Perry!
EVE: Perry?
ADAM: Perry Como! You had him! Go back! Go back!
EVE: Okay, okay! Take it easy!
EVE: How's that?
ADAM: Oh, I could die...
EVE: Over this?
ADAM: Yeah! Listen to this part. This is where it really takes off!
EVE: You are one scary son-of-a-gun.
ADAM: Hey, what are you doing?!
EVE: I know a short-cut.
ADAM: Gee-zooie!! You better slow down!!!
EVE: I can't help it. Perry Como always does this to me! I just get so cranked!
