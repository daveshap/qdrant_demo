My parents don’t like my best friend
So recently I wrote a post about how I wasn’t talking with my best friend anymore and I deleted that because we talked about it and we are friends again.

We weren’t friends for a while because she had the keys to my house and when we were vacationing with my family she came in the house with other people and my parents found out about it.

Now they don’t want me to be friends with her. And I know what she did was wrong but we have been friends for years and she is like a sister to me and I don’t want to end my relationship with her.But I don’t know how to hang out with her without telling my parents every time.

I seriously don’t know what to do
