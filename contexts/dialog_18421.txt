SAUNDERS: What do you want, Senator?
PAINE: Saunders--it's going to go pretty bad for Jeff tomorrow. There's only one thing that can be done for him now-- I--I've written his resignation. He resigns under protest--denying all charges. No one will ever be sure if he was guilty or not. It leaves him with at least a shred of honor. The other way--branded openly in the Senate--expelled--he'll never live it down. Rather a simple compromise than utter ruin. In a year--the whole thing might be forgotten--
SAUNDERS: What are you driving at? You want *me* to get him to sign that?
PAINE: Yes--
SAUNDERS: Why don't you do it yourself?
PAINE: He's lost complete faith in me--
SAUNDERS: Well--me, too!
PAINE: But--you love him, don't you, Saunders?
SAUNDERS: What are you talking about? What difference--?
PAINE: Do you?
SAUNDERS: All right--*yes*! And what does that make me to him? *Nothing*! I've got to go about my own business--and forget it!
PAINE: I thought I could, too. *My* business--this fine future! I have no future I *care* about, if this boy is broken! I--I can't sleep. The only important thing in my life now is to save what I can for him. I want him to get a start again--I'll see that he's taken care of as long as he lives--! Saunders--whether you ever mean anything to him or not--
SAUNDERS: *Me! Me*! I *still* don't see why I should--! If you love him so much, why don't you go to him yourself and-- ? Or better still--get up in that Senate and *fight* for him!
PAINE: It's too late now--it's *impossible*!
SAUNDERS: So I go right back where I was-- carrying compromises--covering up-- back to political tricks--this time for--! No! I was just getting rid of all that. If I did *anything*, I ought to go and tell him to stand up and--. No! I don't want any part of it! Smith or anything else! I'm all through. I want to be left alone!
