I just got accepted for financial aid!
I've been so stressed about working and going to school. My school is so small that I could only find one schedule to fit my needs, 5 days a week. 

I got accepted for grants. All of my tuition paid for plus 6k a year to help with living expenses! 

If you ever thought about going to school, there is aid. And if you do online courses, you have more flexibility.
