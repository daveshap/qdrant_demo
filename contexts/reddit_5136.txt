I'm pretty sure I should just give up finding a job in chemistry
&#x200B;

I've graduated with a Bsc in chemistry, couldn't find a job in chemistry until I pretty much got pity hired out of a receptionist job to be a self employed consultant to an engineering firm, since then I've moved out of the UK to Holland for personal reasons but still have small bits of work to do with them for cash whilst I'm looking for new work, but it is barely liveable wages.

My main issues just come with getting experience. Last job interview I got the feeling that my experience working with instruments at university was null and void because it wasn't paid work. Paid work without experience seems impossible to come by and I can hardly purchase or get my hands on any of the instrumentation personally. Ever job offering has different instrumentation they want experience with.

This is the only topic I enjoy learning things about that I could use as a career, but it just feels like playing a shitty lottery. I get turned down for work that is simple I'm over qualified for, and because I don't have a phd the other half of job postings seem unattainable with my experience.

Feels like I should just cut my loses and go become a chef or something.
