UV Preconditioning test I wanna build a solar panel with a new material and I wanna to test the endurance of the material against UV light. I've found in internet a Standard for UV tests. It says it has to be irradiated with 15kwh/m\u00b2 from 280nm to 385nm. Since I just have a 8w UV lamp I decided to do some scaling to the test. Instead of 1m\u00b2 I made an small sample of 100cm\u00b2. To get the same energy in this surface I calculate that it must be at least 18hours under 8w UV light. Am I right? If not, please show me how to do it. Thanks!
