I want to hug everybody on this subreddit
I won’t say it’ll be ok. I won’t say it won’t be hard. And I won’t say it’ll be easy. But I will say I understand. I’m struggling. I’m struggling so hard. I’ve been struggling for a long time now. It’s hard to get through each day, and sometimes I want to give up. I just want you to know you are worth it. I know these words may be meaningless. I know these words may sound cliche. But please keep going. You where born for a reason. You are here for a reason. You are worth it. Please don’t give up. I wish I could help. I wish I could be strong enough to take all the weight of your sorrow and take it away. I wish I could give you a hug. But I can’t, all I can do is type this hoping it gets through to somebody in need. Thank you for reading, I know it’s just words but I hope it helps a little.
