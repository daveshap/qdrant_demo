SLOANE: ...It's not over, 'til it's over.
PARRISH: Please, Eddie, no 'Fat Lady Sings shit."
SLOANE: I still sense some doubt in this group, we could turn it around. You'll be up in the country?
PARRISH: Yes, the big 'celebration' of my mandatory retirement birthday. You're an honored guest, Eddie.
SLOANE: I'm going to stick it out here. We still have a shot.
QUINCE: What have you done? You've gotten the old man fired!
DREW: That we did. Thanks to you. He was wobbling, mind you, but you spplied the coup de grace.
QUINCE: I'm going to put a stop to this!
DREW: Quince, you can't unscramble scrambled eggs.
QUINCE: But I didn't mean to do it!
DREW: The train's left the station, pal, and you're aboard. Would you like to hear the silver lining? Check that, gold. I've been working with John Bontecou all along. We had a game plan -- acquire Parrish Communications then break it apart and peddle it piece-by-piece to the highest bidder. I set it up for him, he smacks it out of the park.
QUINCE: I don't want to get rich this way -- I'm going to expose you.
DREW: Go right ahead. Tell William Parrish how you betrayed him at a secret Board meeting. And tell Allison how you got her father fired -- and he lost his company.
JOE: I'm sorry, Bill --
PARRISH: That's okay.
JOE: What's okay?
PARRISH: Just a manner of speaking.
PARRISH: What 'okay' is, it's 'okay' it's over. We've got bigger fish to fry, don't we, Joe?
JOE: 'Fish'?
PARRISH: Never mind. I'm tired. I'm going to take a nap.
JOE: I'm not hungry.
PARRISH: Then I can't help you.
SUSAN: You're here?
JOE: I am.
SUSAN: I just thought I'd drop by, scrounge a little lunch, I was in the neigh- borhood --
JOE: How beautiful.
