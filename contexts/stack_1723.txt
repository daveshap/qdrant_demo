What effect does a logic analyzer probe have on a circuit? I have an MCU controlling a LED sign. This sign speaks the HUB75 protocol, which is essentially a large shift register. Being a shift register, this requires a clock signal to be generated, which the MCU appears to do just fine however the sign appears to not interpret it correctly. Annoyingly, connecting a logic analyzer and probe to the offending line causes all glitches to go away, and therefore I ask: what effect does placing a probe onto the signal cause? I'm using a Saleae Logic 8 with it's built-in probes. The datasheet cites an \"input capacitance\" of 10pf, however the effect is not replicated with a 10pf cap to ground.The circuit is running at 3v, but the logic analyzer is powered off of USB, so I'd assume it has 5v -- could this mean there's a pull-up somewhere? I'm running out of ideas, and so I asked here.EDIT: I've done some more testing and the \"fixing\" effect (for lack of a better term) occurs even if the analyzer has no power, just ground and the signal itself.
