DANIEL: Granny, when do we move to the new house?
MA STONE: Move? -- We are not going to move -- the old one is good enough for us.
DANIEL: But I like the new one better.
MA STONE: That's just too bad --
MA STONE: Lan's to goodness, what happened to that hen? Did you use that beanshooter again?
DANIEL: I did not, Grandma.
MARY: Yes, you did, Daniel! I saw it from the window. And then to lie about it! Give me that beanshooter, Daniel!
DANIEL: It's mine, Ma! Pa made it for me -- and I'm not going to give it to anyone!
MARY: Daniel give me that beanshooter!
DANIEL: No! No! I won't.
MARY: Daniel! ... I've stood just about as much as I can bear!
JABEZ: What happened.... Where are you taking him?
MARY: I am going to lock him up.
JABEZ: You're not supposed to punish my son, Mary.
BELLE: That's my business. -- Now, it's all right, Daniel. What did he do?
MARY: He lied to me again.
