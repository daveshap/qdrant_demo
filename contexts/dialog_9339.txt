LINDA: I sent a letter to Doug today. I'll be so glad when he gets out here.
STACY: You really ought to look at this, Linda. There's a drawing on every page... and all these quizzes. It's like school.
LINDA: Why don't you put your mother's secret book back?
STACY: Listen to this... 'What are your mate's three most erogenous zones?'
LINDA: Okay, penis, that's one, balls...
STACY: Wouldn't penis and balls be the same category?
LINDA: You're right. Probably penis, mouth and neck.
STACY: All right! Here's another one. 'The most satisfactory lovemaking occurs when your mate climaxes first, you climax first, you and your mate climax together?'
LINDA: Climax together.
STACY: Does that ever happen?
LINDA: No. But it's a nice idea.
STACY: Listen to this... it says 'Most women derive pleasure from sex, but they don't have real orgasms.'
