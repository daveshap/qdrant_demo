I'm tired
(24M) I'm tired of people telling me that 'there's always someone out there for you"  or "have patience and the right one will find you", I'm tired of hearing lies all the time, like I rather have people tell me the truth and say "hey your right, no one is going to date a guy like you " I literally rather hear that than getting my hopes up for nothing, I don't want to wait around for something that'll never happen...
