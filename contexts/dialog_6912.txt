MRS. FARREN: I've been watching you. You couldn't see me, but I could see you. It was like peeking through a slit in the curtain before the play began. You would be a very good audience. I can see that.
AMY: If you were the lady who gave me a ring, my mother says I have to give it back to you.
MRS. FARREN: Return it to me? Indeed you may not. I gave it to you as a present.
AMY: But my mother says I mustn't accept gifts from strangers.
MRS. FARREN: Stranger? Julia Farren a stranger. Why I've played every theatre from Boston to San Francisco. I've been to London and Paris. Those days â€” those beautiful, shilling, golden days.
AMY: But I only came to give back the ring.
MRS. FARREN: The ring? We'll have no more nonsense about the ring.
