BATEMAN: Jean? Sorbet?
JEAN: Thanks, Patrick. I'd love some.
JEAN: Want a bite?
BATEMAN: I'm on a diet. But thank you.
JEAN: You don't need to lose any weight. You're kidding, right? You look great. Very fit.
BATEMAN: You can always he thinner. Look...better.
JEAN: Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. I don't want to ruin your willpower.
BATEMAN: No. It's all right. I'm not very good at controlling it anyway.
