HELP! I took the wrong job!
This may seem like the epitome of first\-world problems, but I took a job \(mid\-level\) at a large, private institution about 6 months ago and I am really struggling to adjust. It's not so much my core job function, I feel very comfortable with my tasks, but I'm really struggling to find my place, both at the institution and in my office.  Here are the key pieces:

1\) Part of why I struggle is that my institution has a very unique structure, one that I don't feel I fully gathered, either from the interview or my own research, and navigating that has cause me to have to very real questions about my value and place.  Essentially, I feel my position is not designed to be successful. I am not the only one who feels this way, but I don't think other have a real frame of reference.

2\) My office culture is strained to say the least. My supervisor had a very disjointed method of on\-boarding me, and it occurred because if preexisting rifts in our office. I've tried to come in and take initiative to overcome this, but because of my previous point, this is very difficult.

3\) I am an introvert, but my function is one where this is common. I've worked very hard to get to a good place to be successful in my role, but the above mentioned struggles have been super taxing. This to the point where I've been having panic attacks \(which I haven't had in roughly 10 years\).  I've sought counseling through a confidential service my institution provides. 

4\) My commute sucks. I could move, but not enough to make a substantial difference. 

So I'm looking for advice. How to I plot a way out?  I'm in a position where I've saved some funds, and could leave without a new job, but at the opposite end part of me says to suck it up.  I need some fresh opinions. Thanks!
