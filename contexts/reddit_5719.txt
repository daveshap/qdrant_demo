Lack of jobs everywhere.
I’ve applied to over 20 places. Everywhere I go they’re filled up for their seasonal, everywhere I go I’m not old enough to be in that position. I’m a highschool senior and I desperately need a job. It’s actually pissing me off that literally nowhere is accepting applications. I went to the downtown part of my job and went to every single shop and nobody’s hiring. I don’t know what to do anymore and I’m just draining my savings for gas. Anybody have any tips?
