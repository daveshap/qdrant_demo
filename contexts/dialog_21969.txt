JIM: I'm not going to hurt you. PLATO Why did you run out on me?
JIM: We didn't run out. We were coming right back.
PLATO: You sure?
JIM: Sure I'm sure. Judy's waiting. You ready to come out now?
PLATO: No.
JIM: I promise nothing'll happen if you do. You want my jacket? It's warm.
PLATO: Can I keep it?
JIM: What do you think?
JIM: You want to give me your gun now, Plato?
PLATO: My gun?
JIM: In your pocket. Give it to me.
PLATO: I need it.
JIM: You trust me, don't you? Just give it to me for a second.
PLATO: You promised to give it back.
JIM: Friends never break promises, do they? Okay. Here. Now listen. There are a lot of people outside and they all want you to be safe. You understand that? They said I could come in and bring you out.
PLATO: Why?
JIM: They like you. Okay?
PLATO: Come on!
JUDY: Hi, Plato!
PLATO: Hi.
PLATO: Who's that?
JIM: Just a guard.
PLATO: I shot at one of them.
JIM: But you didn't hurt anybody.
PLATO: Those aren't my friends. Make them go away.
JIM: Ray! Will you tell these guys to move back?
