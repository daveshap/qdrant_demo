RENTON: Great.
SWANNEY: And see when I get out of here. I've got plans. Going to get myself straightened out and head off to Thailand, where women really know how to treat a guy. See, out there you can live like a king if you've got white skin and a few crisp tenners in your pocket. No fucking problem.
RENTON: Sure.
SWANNEY: The strategy is this: get clean, get mobile, get into dealing, and this time next year I'll be watching the rising sun with a posse of oriental buttocks parked on my coupon.
RENTON: Sounds great, Swanney.
SWANNEY: Yeah.
RENTON: You'll have to send us a postcard.
SWANNEY: Sure will, pal, sure will.
SICK BOY: Eughh. Sounds horrible.
RENTON: It wasn't that bad.
SICK BOY: Did he -- you know?
RENTON: What?
SICK BOY: You know.
RENTON: No, he didn't make me touch it.
SICK BOY: Oh no, don't even mention it.
RENTON: He made me lick it.
SICK BOY: God, you're sick.
RENTON: And I got a stitch stuck between my teeth, jerked my head back and the whole fucking stump fell off.
SICK BOY: Cut it out.
RENTON: When are you going to visit him?
SICK BOY: Don't know. Maybe Thursday.
RENTON: You're a real mate. And what about Tommy? Have you been to see him yet?
SICK BOY: Fuck you. OK, so Tommy's got the virus. Bad news, big deal. The gig goes on, or hadn't you noticed? Swanney fucks his leg up. Well, tough shit, but it could have been worse.
RENTON: You're all hear.
SICK BOY: I know a couple of addicts. Stupid wee lassies. I feed them what they need. A little bit of skag to keep them happy while the punters line up at a fiver a skull. It's easy money for me. Not exactly a fortune, but I'm thinking, 'I should be coining it here.' Less whores, more skag. Swanney's right. Get clean, get into dealing, that's where the future lies. Set up some contacts, get a good load of skag, punt it, profit. What do you think?
RENTON: Fuck you.
SICK BOY: And I'll tell you why. Because I'm fed up to my back teeth with losers, no-hopers, draftpacks, schemies, junkies and the like. I'm getting on with life. What are you doing?
RENTON: What do you want?
DIANE: Are you clean?
RENTON: Yes.
DIANE: Is that a promise, then?
RENTON: Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.
DIANE: Calm down, I'm just asking. Is that hash I can smell?
RENTON: No.
DIANE: I wouldn't mind a bit, if it is.
RENTON: Well, it isn't.
DIANE: Smells like it.
RENTON: You're too young.
DIANE: Too young for what?
DIANE: You're not getting any younger, Mark. The world is changing, music is changing, even drugs are changing. You can't stay in here all day dreaming about heroin and Ziggy Pop.
RENTON: It's Iggy Pop.
DIANE: Whatever. I mean, the guy's dead anyway.
RENTON: Iggy Pop is not dead. He toured last year. Tommy went to see him.
DIANE: The point is, you've got to find something new.
