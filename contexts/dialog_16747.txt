RUIZ: Don't 'easy Ruiz' me. Y'all turned a Easter egg hunt into a butt-fuck-a- thon. Bring me four eggs Benedict and a mimosa. You all want mimosas?
BOBBY: Nah, man...
RICKY: No...
RUIZ: Four mimosas. You'll love them. So here's the plan. I didn't say shit to Maxie, cause the man has acute angina, and I don't want to get him all worked up.
RICKY: He has a cute what...?
BOBBY: A bad heart.
RUIZ: I didn't tell him shit. He worries too much. I love that old Jew, but he's gonna kill himself worrying. We started this shit, and we're gonna finish it.
RICKY: Who's gonna outfit us?
RUIZ: Outfit? What's he talking about?
BOBBY: Nothing, man.
RICKY: You want us strapped, don't you?
RUIZ: Last thing I want is you with a gun.
HORRACE: Word.
BOBBY: What's the plan?
RUIZ: Tom, the Welsh dude --
RICKY: The Red Dragon.
RUIZ: Shut it, man. Shut it. Tom is a square. He don't but dabble in shit. Maxie had me hook up a loan-back with him, through an Austrian passbook account.
RICKY: So, we're talking money laundering...
RUIZ: Will you tell Peter Jennings to shut up and fucking listen. The shit's as routine as you get. I coulda turned it over offshore in a week, but Maxie likes to do it all his way. Safe. I coulda dropped the bag alone. It's only two hundred G's. But he sent you all. So I can either send you home and tell Maxie, or we can flush the toilet one more time and hope it all goes down.
BOBBY: Let's do it.
RICKY: I'm your soldier.
RUIZ: Now listen. The gig couldn't be simpler. You carry the money to the Welshman, he checks it, hands you his marker, you're done. The washed money goes directly to Maxie. Long as you hand off the bag, you're tight.
BOBBY: Where's the drop?
RUIZ: You three are gonna meet him for dinner. Find out if and where. Now any of you motherfuckers got anything else to say?
RICKY: Yeah.
RUIZ: What?
RICKY: When all this is over and we're not working for Maxie, I'd love to run into you on the street. Why aren't you coming?
RUIZ: That's none of your fucking business.
BOBBY: Why isn't Ruiz coming?
HORRACE: This Welsh dude is tripping on Ruiz cause he's a Shot Caller.
BOBBY: What's that?
HORRACE: A Shot Caller. A boss, a Capo. He's running shit.
BOBBY: Yeah.
HORRACE: The Welsh dude, sees all these niggers in perms and diamonds and shit, he gets nervous. But you motherfuckers, he just laughs. All beat up in your babaloo suit like Fruitpie the Magician.
RICKY: So we just go eat with him and that's gonna solve everything?
HORRACE: Dude, you just gotta settle your shit down. You gotta go and say all that 'Red Dragon' shit. Make him think he's on Barretta.
RICKY: Like you were doing any better shucking and jiving like you were waiting for wings outside the Quick and Split.
BOBBY: So what do we do?
HORRACE: We go and hang out with the dude, make him happy, drink some tea, whatever it takes, until he feels comfortable enough to bring it up on his own. We make the drop, go home to California.
BOBBY: Where is this happening?
HORRACE: We meet at the Globe on Park Avenue at six forty-five. I'll see you then.
RICKY: Let's check out the penguins.
BOBBY: The what?
RICKY: The penguin house.
BOBBY: Wait a minute. You want to look at fucking penguins now?
RICKY: Yeah. Let's look at the penguins.
BOBBY: Did you hear what he just said?
RICKY: Whatever. We're here. We may as well go to the penguin house.
BOBBY: I'm tired and I'm scared, and I'm not looking at fucking penguins.
RICKY: We need guns.
BOBBY: We don't need guns.
RICKY: I'm pretty sure we do.
BOBBY: I listened extremely carefully. Nothing was even vaguely implied. He even laughed in your face when you asked him
RICKY: All the more reason.
BOBBY: You wouldn't even know where to get one.
RICKY: Wanna bet?
BOBBY: You couldn't even get a hand job from bridge and tunnel posse, how you gonna get a gun?
RICKY: That's cause you decided to get all tired all of a sudden.
BOBBY: It was six in the fucking morning.
RICKY: Float me a hundred bucks.
BOBBY: Why?
RICKY: You wanna see how fast I get a gun?
BOBBY: You're out of money?
RICKY: No.
BOBBY: What do you have left?
RICKY: Eighty.
BOBBY: Eighty bucks?!?
RICKY: Eighty five.
BOBBY: What happened to the fifteen hundred?
RICKY: You coulda picked up a tab every once in a while.
BOBBY: I did! I paid for half the fuckin drinks!
RICKY: You did?
BOBBY: Yes I did. You asshole! What about the room?
RICKY: What about it?
BOBBY: They only cover one fifty in incidentals. You've been ordering fucking... Motherfucker...
RICKY: Calm down.
BOBBY: I fucking vouched for you. I vouched for you and you fucked me.
RICKY: This shit's peanuts compared to what we're gonna make with Maxie.
BOBBY: Ricky. I'm trying to save this money. Understand? I'm trying to make it so my girlfriend doesn't have to grind her ass into other men's erections so her daughter can go to private school.
RICKY: I'm sorry...
BOBBY: This is horseshit. It coulda been so easy.
RICKY: It's gonna be fine.
BOBBY: No more, man.
RICKY: Let's get some sleep. That's what we need, man. Sleep.
BOBBY: How we gonna sleep? We only got a few hours til dinner.
RICKY: So what do we do?
BOBBY: Let's just go now and wait.
RICKY: Three and a half hours?
BOBBY: I don't want to take any more chances.
RICKY: Let's just go get guns, I'd feel better.
BOBBY: Don't fuck around. You're gonna get us all killed.
RICKY: Think about it: You knocked out that Jewish kid's tooth, cost him eight grand, maybe more. Maybe lost his whole line of clientele? He knows you're fucking up Jess' dancing, and I got a feeling he knows I stole his carpet cleaning van by the way he looks at me. He can't kill us in LA cause that leads to too many questions. So he flies us out here first class for a 'drop' that's turned into whatever? He can make us disappear out here real nice...
BOBBY: Where do you get this shit?
RICKY: Scenario B. I think I'm getting under Ruiz's skin. I'm no dummy. He doesn't like how it went down with the Red Drag -- Welshman, whatever. Now I got Fruitpie the Magician telling me I can't call my man Max? And that Welshman's sketchy. Whatever, I don't know where it's coming, which way it's coming from, I'm telling you one thing right now, I'm not gonna be late for the dance.
BOBBY: You're not getting a gun.
