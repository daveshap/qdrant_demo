VALIANT: Aah!
ROGER RABBIT: Aah!
VALIANT: What the hell are you doin'?
ROGER RABBIT: I needed a place to hide. I'm in trouble, Eddie.
VALIANT: So I hear. Even talkin' to you could get me a rap for aiding and abetting.
ROGER RABBIT: Don't worry, Eddie, no one knows I'm here.
VALIANT: Oh, yeah? Then how'd you find my house?
ROGER RABBIT: Well, I asked the newsboy on the corner. He didn't know. Then I asked a janitor, the fireman and finally the green grocer down the way. He was very helpful.
VALIANT: In other words, the whole goddamn world knows you're here! Out! Get out!
