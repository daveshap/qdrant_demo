THE KID: I trust you, Bill.
MUNNY: Well, you don't wanna trust me too much. We'll take Ned his share together so you don't figure I run off with it.
LITTLE SUE: Ned's share?
MUNNY: Yeah, he went South ahead of us. I guess we'll catch him before...
LITTLE SUE: He's... he's dead.
MUNNY: No he ain't. He went South yesterday.
LITTLE SUE: They... they killed him. I... thought you know that. I thought you knew because...
MUNNY: Nobody didn't kill Ned, he went South yesterday. He didn't even kill nobody. Why would anybody kill Ned?
MUNNY: Who killed him?
LITTLE SUE: Little Bill. The... the Bar T boys caught him and Little Bill...
MUNNY: He hanged him? Shot him down?
LITTLE SUE: N-no. He... he beat him up. He was making him... answer questions... and beating him up... and then... Ned just died. Little Bill didn't mean to kill him... he said he was sorry an' all... but he said it was a good example anyhow.
MUNNY: Good example! Good example of what I'd like to know? He didn't even kill nobody... he couldn't do it no more.
LITTLE SUE: They got... a sign on him says he was a killer.
MUNNY: A sign on him?
LITTLE SUE: In front of Greely's. It says, This here is what happens to...""
MUNNY: They got a sign on him in front of Greely's?
MUNNY: The questions Little Bill asked him... what sort of questions was they?
LITTLE SUE: About where you an' him was... an' where you was from... an' what your names was... an'...
MUNNY: What'd Ned say?
LITTLE SUE: L-lies... at first. About how you was just passin' through and didn't kill nobody... an' Little Bill kept askin' questions, mixin' him up, catchin' lies... an' then he'd beat on Ned an' Ned would cry and lie some more an' then... then...
MUNNY: Then... what?
LITTLE SUE: A cowboy come in sayin' you killed Quick Mike in the shit house at the Bar T...
MUNNY: An' Little Bill killed Ned for what I done?
LITTLE SUE: Not on purpose. But he started hurtin' him worse... makin' him tell stuff. First ned wouldn't say nothin'... but Little Bill hurt him so bad he said who you was...
LITTLE SUE: He said how you was really Three Fingered Jack out of Missouri... an' Bill said Same Three Fingered Jack that dynamited the Rock Island and Pacific in '69 killin' women and children an' all?" An' Ned says you done a lot worse than that
MUNNY: Didn't scare Little Bill though, did it?
LITTLE SUE: N-no, sir?
MUNNY: Lemmee see that Schofield, Kid.
THE KID: Wha... what f-for?
MUNNY: Lemmee see it.
THE KID: Sure. Sure, Bill.
