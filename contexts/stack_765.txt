LUKS Encrypted Hard Drive \u2014 Passphrase includes '\u00a3' I recently changed my passphrase through 'Disks' and I've included the character \u00a3 in it. I realise now that the UK keyboard mapping only applies after this is done, so trying to type \u00a3 gives me # instead (I'm assuming, I can't see the password).How do I type \u00a3 at the screen 'cryptsetup: please unlock disk'? None of the AltGr+Number or Shift+Ctrl+Something I've looked up seems to work, apart from sometimes shutting off the screen. (e.g. when I press down one of the arrow keys. Why is that?)Hopefully this won't need any personal technical details but if it does I'll put it here.
