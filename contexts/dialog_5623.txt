DYLE: What now?
SCOBIE: We wait -- with our mouths shut.
DYLE: How long do you intend -- ?
SCOBIE: I said with the mouth shut.
DYLE: Sorry about that.
SCOBIE: Okay -- up there.
DYLE: Do I knock or something?
SCOBIE: Open it.
SCOBIE: Keep going.
DYLE: The view had better be worth it.
DYLE: Very pretty. Now what?
SCOBIE: I'll give you a chance, Dyle -- which is more than you'd give me. Where's the money?
DYLE: Is that why you dragged me all the way up here -- to ask me that? She has it -- you know that.
SCOBIE: And I say maybe you both have it! One more time, Dyle -- where is it?
DYLE: Supposing I did have it -- which I don't -- do you really think I'd hand it over?
SCOBIE: You're out, Dyle -- right now!
