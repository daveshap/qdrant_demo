Getting a Picture Together
This is more to share my excitement at this milestone most people have in their teens. 

I’m 26F and I’ve dated plenty, have had boyfriends (none that lasted too long), but for the first time ever me and the guy I’m dating took a picture together. 

So yes, I’m super fucking giddy and happy and I’m looking at it all the time. (It’s also a live photo so I love it more that it captured us goofing off) 

It’s the small things like this that make me feel special and appreciated. It’s been 2 months with this guy and he’s just been a breath of fresh air of how easy it is to talk and be with him. 

So here’s to more positive stories in the future!
