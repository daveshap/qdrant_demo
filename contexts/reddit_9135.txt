Anyone else agree that almost all their problems would be solved with a little bit more money?
They always say money can't buy happiness, but I don't agree. Basically all the things I want to do require money. And they are all things that open up my life more and give more freedom. Surely that would make me happier. Or at the very least, more evenly happy with less downer moments. 

And I'm not talking about being a millionaire or even making 100k a year. My life would be completely different if I just made like 50k a year.  I could afford to buy a car. I could afford to have my own apartment (maybe). I could afford to buy good recording equipment and record an album. I could afford to buy a road bike and get into triathlons... I could afford the crazy entry fees for triathlons. I could afford to do most normal activities.

I'm actually stuck when I try to figure out the problems I have that don't require money. I don't think there are any at all. I'm active, well adjusted and friendly. The only thing is I wish I had more friends, but again that's almost impossible to solve without some money. Joining a rec soccer league for example: I bet that costs like $100. Which I don't have.

Just venting really.

Edit: uh Sooo after I posted this I got a call for an interview for a job that pays 50k exactly. Is God real?
