How does carrier frequency and pulse width modulation in a VFD work together to control AC motor speed? There is a lot of online information about this but there is also a lot of contradictory information. What is carrier frequency exactly and does it stay the same or does it vary? I understand the concept of PWM but if carrier frequency stays constant, then how does an AC motor see varying degrees of pulse width in order to operate on a simulated AC signal? I'm just trying to find the truth, in detail, about the relationship between carrier frequency, the speed reference signal, and PWM in order to control an AC motor.
