I’m a Nurse who killed people
I can’t shake the guilt. I caught covid from a patient in the hospital I work at full time. I work at a nursing home per diem, and went there while I had a slight cough. The day after I worked there I was incredibly sick, and found out my patient at the hospital had tested positive and moved to a ventilator in the ICU. They eventually died and were the first death in my state from the virus. Right now 30 people in the nursing home are positive with covid.

I just graduated from nursing school a few months ago. I have no paid time off, and the three weeks I was out with covid made me have to empty my savings and use my credit just to pay the bills.

Mentally I’m not ok. I don’t think I am coping well. I drink too much. I have been watching suicide videos and been jealous of their courage to go through with it. 

I feel so good when I work in the hospital. But then I’m isolated in my apartment by myself. My girlfriend of five years broke up with me while I was sick with the virus. She had been in PA school in a differed state and has started talking to another guy. 

I just don’t feel good. I cope with alcohol. I have no other outlets. I have scheduled myself to work 50+ this week just so I am not alone in my bed.

Honestly, I feel like I have been screwed. I was on the frontlines treating this disease before PPE and isolation measures were in place. Now work three weeks off after getting sick I can barely keep with the bills. 

I just want to sleep. I sleep all day, because when I sleep I don’t hurt or think about those I have killed. As a new nurse I don’t think I’m prepared mentally for isolation and tragedy.

Edit: Thanks everyone for your kind words. I’m still hurt, but I’m coping. I started reaching out to people. I am going into a program to stop drinking so much. I am safe. I just needed to vent, thanks for allowing me to do so.
