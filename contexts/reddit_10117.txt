Is anyone here willing to review my resume?
I'm currently full-time in student affairs, but due to differences between myself and my leadership, I have decided to part ways from my institution after being here for almost three years. I am hoping to make a lateral move to another institution that is larger than the one I currently work at with an organizational structure that allows me to work with a team that understands the ADA and what the institution's responsibility is under the law. Ideally, I want to work at a small to medium sized institution with a stand alone disability services office or a combined disability services and university testing services office.

Many thanks in advance.
