Centripetal Acceleration as a Cross Product Is it fine to express the centripetal acceleration as a cross product?<br>a=v X w (where a is centripetal acceleration, v is magnitude of velocity, w is angular velocity)  And is it v X w or w X v?  What I think:<br>Since centripetal acceleration requires tangential (perpendicular) velocity, I start thinking about cross products, and was able to express the acceleration vector as 2 other vectors.<br>Fiddling around with my right hand, I think that a=v X w and not a=w X v.<br>Where the convention is<br>-angular velocity towards me implies positive anticlockwise movement<br>-centripetal acceleration upwards is taken as positive<br>-velocity has to move in a way to cause anticlockwise movement  Thing is, I've been searching this up on the Internet but couldn't find any resources for confirmation.  Is it true that centripetal acceleration can be represented as the cross product of velocity and angular velocity? v X w
