COLONEL BAT" GUANO": Major?...Major? I'm Colonel Bat" Guano
MAJOR MANDRAKE: Come in...come in... Peace On Earth... Peace On Earth...yes...
COLONEL BAT" GUANO": Why are you saying that phrase over and over again?
MAJOR MANDRAKE: I think that just might be it! Although it could be Riki-Tiki-Tavi.
COLONEL BAT" GUANO": What are you talking about, Major?
MAJOR MANDRAKE: The three-letter code group. Or maybe some combination of the three letters. P...O...E, or P...E...O, or E...O...P... let's see, there would be six possible combinations.
COLONEL BAT" GUANO": Get a grip on yourself, Major!
MAJOR MANDRAKE: It might still be worth trying Riki-Tiki- Tavi. R...T...T...There's only three combinations of -- T...T...R, or T...R...T...
COLONEL BAT" GUANO": Now, snap out of it, fella!
MAJOR MANDRAKE: Who the hell do you think you are, sir???
COLONEL GUANO: I did that for your own good, fella. Now I'm not going to pull rank on you. When this is over, I'll be happy to step outside with you and settle this thing. Right now my orders are to locate General Ripper and put him on the phone with the President.
MAJOR MANDRAKE: Well, you can't do that because he's dead.
COLONEL GUANO: Do you have any witnesses, Major?
MAJOR MANDRAKE: What?
COLONEL GUANO: What happened, Major? Some kind of private beef between the two of you?
MAJOR MANDRAKE: Look, I didn't shoot him!
COLONEL GUANO: We'll have to leave that up to the C.I.D. boys, won't we, Major?
MAJOR MANDRAKE: Look, Colonel. I've got to talk to somebody at Air Command.
COLONEL GUANO: Don't worry, Major. Your rights will be fully protected.
MAJOR MANDRAKE: Colonel, don't you know what's going on?
COLONEL GUANO: Sure I do. There was some kind of mutiny on the base, and you killed General Ripper.
MAJOR MANDRAKE: Look, General Ripper went off his rocker and ordered the 843rd Bomb Wing to attack with H-bombs.
COLONEL GUANO: You must think I'm an awful sap, Major. Just sit down, fella, and keep your hands on the desk!
MAJOR MANDRAKE: Didn't they tell you?
COLONEL GUANO: They told me, Major. And I didn't hear anything about any atomic attack.
MAJOR MANDRAKE: Look, Colonel. You keep me covered, but let me just pick up this red telephone that connects to Air Command headquarters. Okay?...I won't play any tricks on you... Okay?
COLONEL GUANO: Okay, fella. But just move slow and don't do anything that might surprise me.
MAJOR MANDRAKE: Sure...sure, Colonel. Now look, I'm picking up the phone...nice and slow. Right?...Hello? ...Hello? Hello?...Hello?...Gee, it must be edad. Probably the lines were hit during the fighting.
MAJOR MANDRAKE: Now look, I'm picking up this ordinary telephone. See?...Hello?...Hello?... Nuts, the lines must still be disconnected. The General had us disconnect...
MAJOR MANDRAKE: Look, Colonel. Maybe it's too late. Maybe they've sent Air Command in already. But we've got to try to con- tact somebody.
COLONEL GUANO: On your feet, fella. I've got to get outside and see how my men are.
MAJOR MANDRAKE: Okay, Colonel. But look, there's a pay phone just outside in the hall. Maybe that works, huh? Maybe it'll work? What do you think?
COLONEL GUANO: You've wasted enough of my time, fella.
MAJOR MANDRAKE: Wait a minute. The President!! That's it! The President!!!
COLONEL GUANO: What about the President?
MAJOR MANDRAKE: He wanted to talk to General Ripper, didn't he?
COLONEL GUANO: So what?
MAJOR MANDRAKE: Well, I'm General Ripper's Executive officer. He'll want to talk to me.
