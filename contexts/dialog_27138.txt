PENDERGAST: An original Roger Tory Peterson of a Red-Breasted Merganser. Amazing. I have a copy of this in my office at home.
D'AGOSTA: Can't really focus on birds at the moment, Pendergast. I'm tryin' to keep my breakfast down.
PENDERGAST: In this violent world, I believe the only way to stay sane is to take time to notice beautiful things.
D'AGOSTA: I drink. After hours of course. On duty, I smoke. Do you mind?
PENDERGAST: Not at all. I enjoy the smell of a good cigar.
D'AGOSTA: Then you won't like this one. It's a piece of shit.
PENDERGAST: Lieutenant --
D'AGOSTA: Call me Vince.
PENDERGAST: Did you read about a boat that washed up outside of New Orleans about four months ago? Twelve bodies on board.
D'AGOSTA: Who didn't? Big news. Out of Brazil, wasn't it?
PENDERGAST: Yes. That's my case. Now it's yours. All the corpses were badly mutilated in a very particular way. Decapitated. Brains extracted. Limbs torn to shreds. It looked like the work of a large animal, but there was no sign of an animal on board.
D'AGOSTA: So the method of death is the only connection?
PENDERGAST: No. There's more. There were crates from this museum in the hold of the boat.
BAILEY: Uh, Vince. Sorry. This won't wait.
D'AGOSTA: It better be good.
BAILEY: There are a couple of kids who were lost yesterday near the site of the murder. Claimed they saw a monster. They're pretty determined to tell you their story. You want to see them?
D'AGOSTA: No.
PENDERGAST: If you don't mind, this could be important.
D'AGOSTA: You're kidding.
PENDERGAST: Unfortunately, no.
