JORDY: Mouth's clean, too.
KORFIN: Clean?
JORDY: Don't blow your nose!
JORDY: The smoke'll permeate your nostrils - burn 'em out. Let it run.
KORFIN: But you knew that, right?
JORDY: So the way you see it, two crack heads burned themselves up?
LEON: That's what it looks like to me.
JORDY: And while they're burning up, they're still goin' down on each other? You got to hand it to them.
LEON: Yeah, well, some people got their priorities straight.
LEON: What was that?
JORDY: Evidence. Of a homicide.
JORDY: You know what that is, right?
EDDIE: No, what is it?
JORDY: Why don't you explain it, Bobby. Hey Camello! You mind punching a hole in the floor?
