My 16th birthday is coming up.
My mom called me into her room. She asked me what I want to do for my 16th birthday. "I don't know mom." 
"We could go to an indoor water park!"
"No thanks." Insecure about my body.
"Have a big party with family and friends." 
"No thanks." I don't like the idea of a party with family and I don't have any friends. 
"You could have some friends over?"
"Mom, I don't have any friends to do anything with." At the point I walked out of the room holding back tears.
