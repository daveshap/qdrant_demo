Just a reminder not to let a poor employer/boss hold you down and hold you back.
My story is I was working for Company A who was a great corporation with great pay and benefits. However, my boss was the worst boss I've ever experienced. Constantly fighting and arguing with employees and putting everyone down. 

Fast forward a year of dealing with that job and struggling my way through it. I interviewed with Company B who has same pay, similar benefits, but a boss that genuinely cares about their employees. Outside of orientation I have been doing on the job training for 2 weeks and am already up to pace with the rest of my peers in my KPIs.

I just want this post to serve as a reminder that even if you are in a difficult environment to believe in yourself and keep marketing yourself and interviewing until a similar or better job comes around because your performance can change significantly enough to get your career trending back in the right direction.
