CRAWFORD: Get the roadblocks set on Route Three! There's an access road to the back of the house. That ought to be a second team's approach. Will Graham and I are in an orchard due west of the house.
GRAHAM: How far away's the back-up?
CRAWFORD: Three minutes.
GRAHAM: I'll cover the back.
CRAWFORD: Stay in the trees.
GRAHAM: There's somebody in the house, Jack...
CRAWFORD: Wait for the back-up! Will?
GRAHAM: It's happening again, Jack...
