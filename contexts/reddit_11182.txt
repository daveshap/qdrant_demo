I'm not doing to well rn
I was browsing Google and thought I'd look up "the effects of beating children" (I was beaten when I was younger and am still disciplined with it to this day I'm 15 btw) and the effects sound a lot like what my mindset and personality are like I can't fight I can't lift a hand to someone if someone hits me I'll sit there and take it I tend to bottle up my emotions and put others first even if it hurts my mother would often beat me if I did something wrong when I was younger and then try to smooth things out with motherly love it actually caused more pain and damage than it did healing and happiness I am also bullied a lot and belittled by my fellow students Ive been emotionally shut off for most of my life I've also faced abuse from the age of four up to six by a girl I looked up to I can't form attachments to people because my mind is set on the one rule Ive followed for a while "they will hurt you." I'm really just looking for a little bit of weight off my shoulders so if you read this thank you.
