How do you “play it cool” when you’re extremely lonely and someone you like is interested in you?
I tend to come off as desperate when I meet someone I like. I try to hang out with them as soon as possible. I tell them they’re beautiful and shower them with compliments. I text too much. 

I keep driving women away but I don’t know how to stop myself.
