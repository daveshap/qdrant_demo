COMMODUS: I should at least have you, don't you think?
LUCILLA: If you get me pregnant with a boy he'll be a double direct heir and will end up killing you for the throne.
COMMODUS: Did Narcissus die today? Wasn't this his day to die?
LUCILLA: I'm sure, I don't know.
COMMODUS: Tribuus, what happened in the arena? Was Narcissus killed?
TRIBUUS: He must have been. He was on the list of prisoners to be executed.
LUCILLA: No one in Rome has ever heard of him. Do you want to remind those few in the Senate who have? The whole sordid thing is far beneath your position to begin with. Forget about him.
COMMODUS: Let some time pass... then ask, quietly, without anyone knowing it comes from me.
