Lonely and frustrated
Everyone in my friend group has recently got into relationships and we spend less time together and when we do all they talk about is how great their relationship are and keep insisting i should get a girlfriend.

Im a reserved person who doesn't really go out of their way to talk to people im not shy im just lazy and only have so much social energy i can spend on people and because of this my social skills are the best plus im not drop dead gorgeous (yet) so my personality is gonna have carry me to the promised land to bad i have the personality f a brick wall. If you search up approach in the dictionary a picture of will show up most definitely 

Girls arent really attracted to me and the only one that was crazy and threatened to lock my in her basement and keep me as a sex slave for refusing to go out with her

When it comes to picking up chick i dont know what im doing I dont know how to flirt, smooth talk or show someone im intrested in them. i dont have any motivation to look for a relationship but a still cant help but feel lonely sometimes in the friend group im tye only virgin left and there is a runnings hashtag in pur groupchat with i find hilarious #GetCamCoochie2020 and joking poke fun at me for being a lightskin that doesn't know how to lightskin the jokes dont bother me

Im mostly mad at myself for procrastinating social skills in grade school ive been teying my best to improve them but im not a player levels of charisma yet.
