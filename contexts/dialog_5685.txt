JODY: You know her?
BRENT: It can't be.
JODY: Who is she Daddy?
BRENT: Never mind darling. You go back to school. I don't want you missing anymore classes today.
BRENT: IT'S LISA SHERMAN. But she still looks like we're eighteen.
TOM: That's impossible.
BRENT: I swear to God. It's her. She told Jody she was Kenny's 'AUNT LISA'. I'm getting this sickly feeling...
TOM: Calm down Brent.
