What to look for in the House Science Committee's upcoming hearing on Climate Science.

The US House of Representatives has scheduled a Full Committee Hearing for this Wednesday on the topic: [*Climate Science: Assumptions, Policy Implications, and the Scientific Method.*](https://science.house.gov/legislation/hearings/full-committee-hearing-climate-science-assumptions-policy-implications-and) The [charter](https://science.house.gov/sites/republicans.science.house.gov/files/documents/HHRG-115-SY-20170329-SD001.pdf) includes a list of witnesses and states:

>The purpose of this hearing is to examine the scientific method and process as it relates to climate change. The hearing will also focus on the underlying science that helps inform policy decisions.

That brings up the following questions:

1. Is this committee qualified to "examine the scientific method and process"?  
2. Does the witness list indicate representation of mainstream scientific positions?
3. What, if anything, does the outcome of such hearings historically tell us about the policy goals of the body that convenes them?
4. What policies does the committee control that can be affected by the outcome of this hearing?
