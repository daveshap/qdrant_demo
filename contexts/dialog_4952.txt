LOU: Hello, Walter.
WALTER: Hi. I know you! I've seen you down at the Jabberjaw plenty.
LOU: Yes, you have. Can I come in?
WALTER: Uh, sure.
WALTER: I was going to make some pancakes, you can have some if you like.
LOU: Hm.
WALTER: Did you see my cat?
LOU: Yeah I did.
LOU: I also saw the girl give you this.
WALTER: Oh yeah that was Mayolia, she's a nice girl. She's kind of strange, though.
LOU: You like chasing the dragon, Walter?
WALTER: Chasing the dragon? Whaddya mean? You sure you don't want a pancake?
LOU: You can cut the crap.
LOU: Police officer.
WALTER: You're like an undercover guy!
LOU: You're in some deep shit pal, whether you know it or not.
WALTER: Huh?!!!
LOU: Possession of narcotics isn't something we take lightly, you understand?
LOU: But I got a feeling you're gonna cooperate with me. Yessir, I think you and me are gonna be real good friends. Why don't you tell me about your connection.
WALTER: C-connection?
LOU: I'm not looking to pinch you! I don't care about you, or the girl. But you want to save your ass, you better start telling me what I want to hear. Now!
WALTER: Telling you what?
LOU: Who's the head honcho! Who's providing the smack connection!
WALTER: Smack?
LOU: Goddammit, where are you from, Mars?
WALTER: Alaska! What the heck's wrong with it!
LOU: Haven't you ever heard of smack! Horse! Junk! Heroin!
WALTER: Is that what that is? I never seen any before. I always thought that stuff was expensive!
LOU: Oh, yeah. It can get real expensive.
