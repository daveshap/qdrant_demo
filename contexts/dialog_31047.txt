LULA: What you want to watch this trash for? Ain't one of those people have a real thought in their brain.
SAILOR: That so? You want to tell me what, if any, real thoughts you had lately?
LULA: What you have to get personal about so quick? All I mean is you could possibly read a book.
LULA: What's that honey?
SAILOR: We didn't have no TV up at Pee Dee, baby, you know?
LULA: I'm sorry, sweetie. I forget some moments where all you been the last two years.
SAILOR: Twenty-three months, eighteen days is all. Don't need to make more'n it was. This couple's goin' on a date to Hawaii. The girl chose him over the other two guys.
LULA: Don't the reject guys get anythin'?
SAILOR: Gift certificates to Kentucky Fried Chicken.
LULA: That don't seem fair.
SAILOR: Hell, why should the Datin' Game be different from real life? At least them boys is gonna get somethin' to eat.
LULA: Sailor?
SAILOR: Yeah?
LULA: Wouldn't it be fabulous if we somehow stayed in love for the rest of our lives?
SAILOR: You think of the weirdest damn things to say sometimes, peanut. Ain't we been doin' a pretty fair job this far?
LULA: Oh, you know exactly what I mean, honey? It'd make the future so simple and nice.
SAILOR: At Pee Dee, all you think about is the future, you know? Gettin' out? And what you'll do and what you'll think about when you're on the outside again.
LULA: I just think about things as they come up. I never been much of a planner.
SAILOR: It ain't altogether terrible just to let things go along sometimes. Lula, I done a few things in my life I ain't too proud of, but I'll tell ya from now on I ain't gonna do nothin' for no good reason. All I know for sure is there's more'n a few bad ideas runnin' around loose out there.
