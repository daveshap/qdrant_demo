Those in the Health Informatics field, is the school where you get your masters important?
Planning to go back to get an MS in HI (unrelated background) and I’m looking into some programs and I’m leaning towards the programs in Chicago as they’re nearby and in the city so I’m hoping it would be a bit easier to find an intern or part time job. I’m also coming from an unrelated background (Environmental Science) so some are more lenient when it comes to prerequisites. So, back to the question, is the school where you get your masters important if you get work, and possibly research, experience? 

Thanks!
