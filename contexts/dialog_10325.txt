MICHAEL: `Why doesn't he come live with us?' Because everything is here.
NICKY: I know, Pop.
MICHAEL: I'm lucky they don't knock down the building. It could happen anytime. And everything worth remembering is right here.
NICKY: I think the building's okay. At least for the time being.
MICHAEL: You didn't think it was okay when you lived here. You wanted to get out so fast I thought you were running a marathon.
NICKY: Normal boy's ambition. I like coming back. You know that.
MICHAEL: You tell your friends your father used to work the docks. Callused hands. But you had an attitude when you were growing up that wasn't easy for your mother and me to understand.
NICKY: I was in a hurry to do big things, make big mistakes. Any mistakes were okay as long as it was big. But I'm trying to see these things clearly and honestly. That's the play they're going to kill starting tonight. There's a guy out there getting ready to rip it apart. And that's us. Who we were and where we come from.
MICHAEL: So what are you going to do about it?
NICKY: What do you want me to do?
MICHAEL: Show him who we are.
NICKY: He carries a gun.
ELLIOT: Then you should carry a gun.
NICKY: I used to carry a gun when I drove a cab.
ELLIOT: Where is it?
NICKY: I gave it away. I thought, I'm a writer now.
ELLIOT: That was a big mistake.
