JACK: History.
SUSIE: Huh?
JACK: My father proposed to my mother in there.
SUSIE: No kidding?
SUSIE: The both of them? In there?
JACK: He called her.
SUSIE: Oh. So what's it doing here?
JACK: Long story.
SUSIE: You sending me home?
JACK: They'd been out dancing all night and he took her to the train station -- she lived over in Brookhaven. Usually held ride with her, but this time he didn't. Anyway, he starts walking home, only as he's walking he starts getting nervous.
SUSIE: Nervous?
JACK: By the time he gets to the corner newstand, he's got her meeting some rich guy on the train, the rich guy's asked her to marry him, and he's reading about it in the morning edition.
SUSIE: You're kidding.
JACK: He had a mind that escalated things.
SUSIE: So, what happened?
JACK: He calls her, asks her to marry him, she thinks he's crazy, he asks her again, she still thinks he's crazy but says yes anyway, and the next thing you know he's got his brothers down there and they're tearing the thing right off the curb.
JACK: I don't know. Maybe he thought some rich guy was gonna try and call her.
SUSIE: Wow. But I still don't see how ...
JACK: Ma didn't want it around. After.
SUSIE: Oh.
