Do free particles slow down in expanding universe? My favorite toy model of cosmic microwave background in the expanding universe is a cube with totally reflective walls. If CMB is a black-body radiation, it must be isotropic and homogeneous - the same number of photons go through a side of the cube, so it can be reflective and the effect is the same. This model (remnant of my Olbers paradox period) seem to work also if the cube is expanding - it gives redshifted that is colder CMB.Recently I imagined free (non-relativistic) particles instead of photons in the cube. This again requests that the universe is homogeneous and motion of particles is isotropic. But now I have a problem - if the walls of the cube are moving (the cube or the universe is expandind), this model suggests that the particles slowly come to rest (they reflect from receding walls).
