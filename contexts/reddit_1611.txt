He got in
A close friend got into Yale today. 

I have an 8th period release, but I stayed with him in the back office of the science lab, waiting the extra half hour to witness his decision notification.  I must have been just as anxious as he was, sitting on my hands and bouncing up and down while he paced back and forth.  Finally, his portal updated.

It was a black screen.  He zoomed out to see a video screen, just waiting for him to press play.

*Congratulations!*

I never really understood the feeling that redditors have felt when a friend got in.  Probably because I hadn't experienced it before.  But now I know.  It is just as exciting watching your friend jump up and down as it is to get accepted yourself.  We've both edited each other's essays and fretted over finishing in time together.  I sat next to him in class, I watched all the hard work he put into his application, and now I've watched all that hard work pay off.  It was incredibly exciting for me to see him celebrate, and I don't think I could describe the feeling if I tried.

Marcus, if you read this, congratulations.  I am proud of you.
