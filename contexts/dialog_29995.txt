TOBY: I axed you a question.
JENNY: Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing. We was just talking.
TOBY: You shut your mouth, girl, and get back over to our table. Now, I'm not going to axe you again, Mister. What were you doing with my girl?
BOBBY: I wasn't doing anything.
TOBY: That's not the way it looked to me. Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.
BOBBY: Make time? Is everybody in this town on drugs?
JENNY: Honest, Toby. I just axed him for a quarter for the jukebox.
TOBY: Stay out of this, Jenny. We got man's business to take care of. I ain't never taken no drugs, mister, and ...
BOBBY: Then maybe you should've. Look, pal, I wasn't making a play for your girl.
TOBY: You expect me to believe that?
BOBBY: I don't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone.
TOBY: Mister, I'm calling you out.
BOBBY: What? You want to fight? Over her?
