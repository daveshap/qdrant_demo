KOREAN DOCTOR: You please excuse... I have been making examination of this young man to find if he will be soldier in our army.
HAWKEYE: Yes, I know. Hi, Ho-Jon. How did it go?
KOREAN DOCTOR: I don't liking it at all, what I hear when I listen to the heart. And such a blood pressure for so young a boys. Is frightening.
HAWKEYE: I'm sorry to hear that. You think he's unfit for military service?
KOREAN DOCTOR: At first is no doubt. But then I am seeing on his paper he work in American hospital. And I think there are so many drugs in such a places, he could take some by mistake.
HAWKEYE: Why would he do that?
KOREAN DOCTOR: Who is knowing? But the drug I have find in his urine is solving all mysteries. By tomorrow will be gone his fast heart and high blood pressure. So I think maybe you will like to tell him goodbye. Okay?
