a guy i think i love
i have been friends with this guy for a little bit of time and we have spent a lot of time together. whenever i am with him i am happy and i can tell a difference in my mood and whenever we are in the same place i just want to be around him. i feel like he’s the only one who knows how to make me feel happy and he makes me feel like there is actually a purpose for me being  in the world. I know i am in love with him but i don’t want to come out with it because he also dated one of my friends. i don’t know what to do because something has happened recently where he betrayed my trust but part of me still likes him/ loves him the same as i did before. I don’t know what to do and am lost because i have never felt this way towards another person before, he’s on my mind all day and he’s basically all i talk about. i really need advice because i don’t have anyone i can talk to and all my friends wouldn’t know what to do either. we have also flirted before but i feel like guys around me are using me for my body which has destroyed my self confidence level tremendously which is making me scared to tell him. i feel like i’m stuck and i need help/ advice on what to do.
