HAMISH: Rest, William.
WALLACE: I rest.
HAMISH: Your rest is making me exhausted.
STEPHEN: Come, it'll help you sleep.
WALLACE: Aye. But it won't let me dream.

ROBERT: He was a modest man.
CRAIG: It will not be long before Longshanks too is encased in stone, and his crowns divided for others to wear.
