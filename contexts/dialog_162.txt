EDDIE: Are you hit?
LEON: No. I'm okay.
JORDY: Bobby, Bobby! Where're you hit?!
KORFIN: It hurts. Aw, Jesus!
JORDY: Lay down. Stay down, Bobby.
LEON: He got my gun! Motherfucker was filming the whole time!
EDDIE: I know. Relax. Take it easy. Don't worry, we'll get those fuckers.
NICOLETTE: Detective - can you tell us what happened here?
EDDIE: I can't talk right now. We have some things to take care of.
NICOLETTE: I understand, but I noticed that the Fire Marshall is here with you. Is this somehow related to the fire department?
EDDIE: I really can't give out any information right now at this point.
NICOLETTE: Okay. But I do understand that your partner, Leon Jackson's been injured. Is that correct?
EDDIE: He was hurt, but not seriously. He'll be fine.
NICOLETTE: Do you have the suspect in custody?
EDDIE: Um...now is not a good time, okay. Detective Jackson's hurt. He's fine. I've got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective Jackson is hurt but not seriously.
NICOLETTE: Alright, cut, cut, cut.
NICOLETTE: Eddie, are you okay?
EDDIE: Yeah. Now's not a good time.
NICOLETTE: Alright.
EDDIE: Alright?
NICOLETTE: Alright.
EDDIE: Alright.
NICOLETTE: Okay.
DAPHNE: I told your partner, I can't help. I didn't see anything.
EDDIE: C'mon, start at the beginning. You know these people?
DAPHNE: Tamina was a friend of mine. My shower was broken, she let me use theirs.
EDDIE: Go on.
EDDIE: Whether you tell us or not, we'll find out. Better if it comes from you.
DAPHNE: If I tell you, will you arrest me?
EDDIE: Arrest you for what? Why would we arrest you?
EDDIE: What are you hiding? Why are you afraid
JORDY: She just saw two of her friends killed! They probably threatened her.
EDDIE: Is that all there is?
EDDIE: Are you here illegally? Don't worry about that. We'll talk to Immigration. They won't deport you.
DAPHNE: No, no, don't talk to Immigration!
JORDY: Why not?
EDDIE: Something back home?
DAPHNE: ...my little sister and I shared a flat - I came home one night and a man was raping her. His gun was on the chair... He came at me and I shot him.
JORDY: Alright. That's a justifiable homicide.
DAPHNE: Yes, but he was a cop.
EDDIE: A cop?
DAPHNE: I'm from a small town in Slovakia. Like the South here. The Police is right, a civilian is wrong. So I fled.
EDDIE: Look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth?
DAPHNE: You're a cop - you'll never believe me.
