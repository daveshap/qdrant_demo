FLORIS: Mr. Juarez?
CRAIG: Yes?
FLORIS: Yex?
CRAIG: I said yes.""
FLORIS: You suggest what? I have no time for piddling suggestions from mumbling job applicants, my good man. Besides, Dr. Lester will see you now. I think that's what he said.
LESTER: Come in, Mr. Juarez. I'd stand, but, well, you know.
CRAIG: Actually, my name is Craig Schwartz, Dr. Lester.
LESTER: Security.
CRAIG: No, it's okay, sir. Just a mixup with your secretary.
LESTER: She's not my secretary. She's what they call an executive liaison, and I'm not banging her, if that's what youâ€™re implying.
CRAIG: Not at all, Dr. Lester. I simply misspoke.
LESTER: Tell me, Dr. Schwartz, what do you feel you can bring to LesterCorp?
CRAIG: Well, sir, I'm an excellent filer.
LESTER: You think so, eh? Which comes first, L or... Glooph?
CRAIG: Glooph is not a letter, sir.
LESTER: Damn, you are good. I tried to trick you. Okay, put these in order.
LESTER: Floris, get Guinness on the phone.
FLORIS: Gehginnis ondah foam?
LESTER: Forget it.
FLORIS: Fork ah did?
LESTER: Fine woman, Floris. I don't know how she puts up with this damn speech impediment of mine.
CRAIG: You don't have a speech impediment, Dr. Lester.
LESTER: Flattery will get you everywhere, my boy. But I'm afraid I have to trust Floris on this one. You see, she has her doctorate in speech impedimentology from Case Western. Perhaps you've read her memoirs, I can't understand a word any of you are saying.""
CRAIG: No.
LESTER: Pity, it tells it like it is. That's why the eastern, read Jewish, publishing establishment won't touch it. That's a quote from the book jacket. George Will, I think. I apologize if you can't understan a word I'm saying, Dr. Schwartz.
CRAIG: No. I understand perfectly.
LESTER: Thank you for being kind enough to lie. You see, I've been very lonely in my isolated tower of indecipherable speech. You're hired. Any questions?
CRAIG: Just one. Why is this floor so short?
LESTER: Low overhead, m'boy. We pass the savings on to you. But seriously, that's all covered in orientation.
