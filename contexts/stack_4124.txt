Is it okay to use my German Schengen visa to enter Austria for study until residence permit is issued? I have a 2-year Schengen type C visa issued by Germany to visit my sibling who studies there. I wanted to know if it's okay to use this visa to enter Austria to start my university studies. I already entered Germany a couple of times and used it to enter France and Greece twice. I will not exceed 90 days and I have already applied to the residence permit. Will there be a problem to use that visa?
