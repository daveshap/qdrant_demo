GRETCHEN: Hey.
DONNIE: Hey. You OK?
GRETCHEN: My mom is gone.
DONNIE: Where is she?
GRETCHEN: I don't know. She didn't leave a note. The house is all messed up.
DONNIE: But you're OK?
DONNIE: Did you call the cops?
GRETCHEN: Yeah, they told me to get out of the house.
GRETCHEN: I'm so scared... I just keep thinking that something awful has happened. It's my fucking stepdad. I know it.
DONNIE: It's safe here.
