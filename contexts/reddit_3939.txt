Is it true that guys won’t approach girls they find attractive because they are scared of getting rejected?
I don’t believe this is the case - but my friends seem to think that guys will not approach me because they are scared of rejection. This is in no way me claiming to be super attractive - I’m average, but I know I dress nicely and am good with hair/makeup so pull myself together reasonably well. 

I’ve been single for a year and only been asked on two dates - both I had to semi initiate...I’m starting to get resentful about the lack of proper attention I receive. Sure, guys message me on Instagram all the time, but when it comes to a real life scenario, I rarely get approached, unless it’s by really cocky/overly confident guys (which I’m not interested in). 

What should I do in this situation?
