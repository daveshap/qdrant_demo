What does \";\" in \"If in Your Dreams; the Flood\" mean? Context: \"If in Your Dreams; the Flood\" is the title of a visual novel. In short, it's story about a girl who suffers from constant nightmares, namely she has dreasm about the flood, and each time she sleeps the flood becomes more dangerous and frightening. I suspect that \";\" meant to show that the visual novel has TWO names, (\"If in Your Dreams\" and \"The Flood\" respectively), they were just combined in one title.Am I correct? If not, then what can it mean?
