HORRACE: Now, here's what worries me. He said he wants to meet up at a bar in Red Hook. You know where that is?
BOBBY: No.
HORRACE: Brooklyn.
BOBBY: Yeah?
HORRACE: He must have that shit troughed.
BOBBY: What do you mean 'troughed?'
HORRACE: Troughed off. Protected. Like, you know, like he got a moat around it.
BOBBY: Ruiz tied in out there?
HORRACE: Nah, man. No one is. They got some Puerto Ricans and a new crop of fuckin Irish immigrants.
RICKY: I'm half Irish.
HORRACE: I don't fuck with those crazy, off- the-boat fuckin Irish. You heard of the Westies?.
BOBBY: Heard of them.
HORRACE: They ran shit back in the Eighties. Used to cut motherfuckers heads off and sit them on the bar. That's back when the Irish was making a play against the Italians. I don't know if they still around, but I don't fuck with those motherfuckers just in case.
BOBBY: It sounds to me like everybody's just a little jumpy. And since all it is is a drop, the Welshman's got nothing at stake. I say we go to his 'troughed off' bar. It'll calm his nerves, we drop the bag, and we all get back to our lives.
HORRACE: And not a word to Maxie. He'll shit if he knew we crossed a bridge.
