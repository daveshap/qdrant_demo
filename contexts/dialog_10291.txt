JASON: There's no hatch. There's no hatch!
GWEN: Wait... Jason, Here!...
JASON: Okay, we got it.
BRANDON: Okay, you can go on in... I'm going to get Kyle. He knows the utility tunnel system better than anybody alive.
KYLE: Hi Brandon.
BRANDON: No time for pleasantries, Kyle. We have a level five emergency. The Commander needs us to get him to the core and shut it down before it overloads.
KYLE: Oh. Okay.
BRANDON: You've got the utility systems walkthrough, right?
KYLE: I have sectors 1-28. I think Hector has the upper levels.
BRANDON: We'd better get everybody online. And Kyle, Stop downloading porn. Your frame rate is unacceptable.
