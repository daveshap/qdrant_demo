Did anyone try the "ignore women, live your life and women will enter your life" approach? It didn't work for me
I see this dating advice given out a lot of times. They say to ignore women, live your life and you will find that women enter your life and become attracted to you. I've also seen many times guys saying that once they start ignoring women, women became more attracted to them.

Did it work for you? I tried this approach for about 3 years and nothing happened. I wasn't any closer to getting a girlfriend, a date or sex than I was before. I lived my life and achieved things but nothing happened with regards to women.
