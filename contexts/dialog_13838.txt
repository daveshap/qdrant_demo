WIGAND: You manipulated me into this...!
LOWELL: That's bullshit, Jeff!
WIGAND: You greased the rails!
LOWELL: I greased the rails for a guy who wanted to say yes. I helped him to say yes. Alright. You're not a robot, Jeff! That's all. You got a mind of your own, don't you?
WIGAND: Up to you
LOWELL: I fought for you... and I still fight for you.
WIGAND: You fought for me...?! ...you manipulated me... into where I am now... staring at the Brown & Williamson Building. It's all dark. Except the 10th floor! That's the legal department. That's where they fuck with my life!
LOWELL: Jeffrey, where you going with this? So where you goin'? You are important to a lot of people, Jeffrey. You think about that. You think about them.
