ALEX: You know, you should spend some of that money instead of worrying about it. That's my advice.
JULIET: He's right. You'd feel much better about it.
ALEX: Once it's spent you won't have to worry about it.
JULIET: Be like a weight off your shoulders.
ALEX: You know we're right.
JULIET: Don't you?
DAVID: I want to secure it.
ALEX: Secure it? What do you mean -- you're gong to take it to a bank? You're not going to take it to a bank? You're not going to take it to a bank Or what, you want to bury it? Is that it?
JULIET: I don't see the point in that.
ALEX: Because that's no good. Remember, we did what we did, we took the money. It was a material calculation. But what's the use if it's underground, or in some funny bank in some funny place? If you can't spend it, if you can't have it, what use is it? None. It's nothing, all for nothing, if you do that. I didn't get into this for nothing, so that I could have nothing --
