MAL: Where is Rae?
EZRA: She's gone, gone to town. She hated working on the farm... ...just like you.
MAL: What happened?
EZRA: They run me off. They burned me out. They made it so I couldn't do. Just like Georgia. If you won't sell, they take it anyway.
MAL: Who?
EZRA: The cattle! This valley runs down to a clear creek. That's why we picked this spot, and that's why they don't want us here.
MAL: You own this land.
EZRA: I paid the government for it, all right. That don't mean much out here. Malachi, I'm living like a wildcat in a cave in those hills. Hiding out, afraid to walk my own land.
MAL: What about the law?
EZRA: Whose law? The law here runs a man down -- just like these cattle.
