ANNIE: You still spooked?
LAURIE: I wasn't spooked.
ANNIE: Lies.
LAURIE: I saw someone standing in Mr. Riddle's back yard.
ANNIE: Probably Mister Riddle.
LAURIE: He was watching me.
ANNIE: Mister Riddle was watching you? Laurie, Mister Riddle is eighty-seven.
LAURIE: He can still watch.
ANNIE: That's probably all he can do.
ANNIE: What's the pumpkin for?
LAURIE: I brought it for Tommy. I figured making a Jack-O-Lantern would keep him occupied.
ANNIE: I always said you'd make a fabulous girl scout.
LAURIE: Thanks.
ANNIE: For that matter, I might as well be a girl scout tonight. I plan on making popcorn and watching Doctor Dementia. Six straight hours of horror movies. Little Lindsey Wallace won't know what hit her.
