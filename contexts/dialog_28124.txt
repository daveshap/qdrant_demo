EMILY: May I ask where you’re from, Mr Lamont?
LOMBARD: Europe... France. I’m French but I live in London... ... England.
EMILY: You’re a long way from home...
LOMBARD: You wouldn’t have a cigarette, would you?
EMILY: I don’t smoke. If you could get to the point...
LOMBARD: You’re sure you won’t sit down, Miss Stewart?
EMILY: I’m fine standing, thank you.
