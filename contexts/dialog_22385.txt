SAM: Don't talk to me unless you tell me what I want to hear, understand?!? You have no choice in this, don't think about winning, think about staying alive. I want the item, and if you don't give it to me, I'm gonna kill you.
GREGOR: I don't have it with me...
SAM: Bullshit!
GREGOR: I swear...
SAM: Then where is it?
GREGOR: I sent it to myself in Paris.
SAM: Sent it where?
GREGOR: A post office box.
