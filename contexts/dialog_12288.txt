VERONICA: I don't know, it was okay, I guess.
MOM: Terrible thing. So will we get to meet this dark horse prom contender?

VERONICA: Because you're an idiot.
DAD: Oh yeah, that's it.
MOM: You two....
VERONICA: Greate pate, but I'm going to have to motor if I want to be ready for the funeral tomorrow.
