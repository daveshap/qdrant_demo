I am getting fired tomorrow. Should i quit?
I've heard from 2 co-workers that they are planning on firing me tomorrow when I come in for my shift. Thing is, I put my 2-week resignation in last week. I have about 4 shifts left, also have another (and better) job lined up. Not sure how to go about this.

Any feedback is appreciated.
