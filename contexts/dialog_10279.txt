GWEN: Jason.. Can you hear me?
JASON: Yes. Yes, I'm here!
GWEN: Thank God. Are you okay?
JASON: Yeah. But I've got Gorignak staring me in the face. I think I can take it though...
GWEN: Jason, we're going to use the digital conveyer to get you out of there.
JASON: The digital conveyer? You mean I'm going to get diced into cubes and sorted up there in a thousand pieces?
FRED: Right.
JASON: I'll take my chances with Gorignak.
