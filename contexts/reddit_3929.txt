Choosing to stay single
32(F). After a lot of thought, I’ve decided that due to my financial situation (a lot of student loan debt, no savings) I’m going to stay single for 4 more years. In 4 years I will be in a better place financially.. I’ll still have student loan debt, but no credit card debt, a higher credit score, and at least $10k in savings. 

While I know this is the best option given my situation, It makes me really sad to come to this realization. I’ve been single for 5 years already and accepting that I’ll be alone for 4 more years is heart wrenching. I also feel like my opportunity to have a family/child is quickly slipping away. 

*kicking my younger self for getting into this financial mess*

Can anyone here relate?

*Edit* I did not expect this post to get this many responses. I appreciate hearing your stories and advice SO much. Thank you to everyone of you. I’m going to re-evaluate and take your advice into consideration.
