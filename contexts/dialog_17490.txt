SUSAN: Where are you going?
JOE: To bed.
SUSAN: 'To bed'?
JOE: Yes. I'm tired.
PARRISH: That was wonderful.
SUSAN: Yeah, it's good to get together.
PARRISH: Do you mind if I raise a little caution flag?
SUSAN: Raise away.
PARRISH: What is the nature of your interest in Joe?
SUSAN: Well, remember how you told me about lightning striking"? The nature of it's in there somewhere."
PARRISH: I won't say you may be getting onto shaken ground --
SUSAN: Then what will you say?
PARRISH: I don't think this is the lightning you are looking for. Drew's a good man. I know I didn't seem to be completely in his corner before, but I've come to appreciate --
SUSAN: Now we love Drew and Joe in verbo- ten? What's going on?
PARRISH: Nothing.
SUSAN: When you say 'nothing' that way, it's not nothing.
PARRISH: Then what is it?
SUSAN: It's something.
