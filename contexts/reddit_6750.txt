LinkedIn recruiter etiquette and insight
I've done a bit of searching through past threads, but I am looking to get some more perspective on linkedin recruiters. It seems as though in the past couple weeks I have been hit up more than before through linkedin about potential opportunities from recruiters. I work in RE development/construction/design in a medium west coast city. I typically haven't responded to these requests. Is that rude? Since they aren't solicited I don't know whether it's worth responding (read: networking), and the recruiters don't say outright who they are representing. There are companies I would not consider at all and wouldn't want to waste anyone's time. Is there some standard of confidentiality here where I wouldn't find out without directly asking right off the bat?

How do these recruiters go about finding people they message? These messages as of late have been more specific and tailored to specific positions Iâ€™ve held or skills I list. 

I am generally happy in my position due to flexibility, work/life balance, co workers and project types, but am also curious about other opportunities and taking on more since I am <4 yrs in the industry. I am particularly curious what others would offer compensation-wise, but it would take quite a bit to consider other opportunities.
