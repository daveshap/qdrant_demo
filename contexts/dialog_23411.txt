MARY: Don't. We know what happened. Don't go on.
GREGORY: Any court in the land would understand. We'll wait a few days -- let you rest -- then we'll go to the police.
MARY: It will all be over in such a little while, Jacqueline, and everything will be all right again. Drink your coffee.
GREGORY: I thought I might close up the apartment -- maybe get a place in Connecticut.
MARY: You'd love that, Jackie. Remember that last summer with Mother in the Berkshires? You used to help the gardener.
JUDD: Yes. You could become a country wife -- fool around with petunias and pullets.
MARY: It will be fun meeting Gregory every night at the station.
