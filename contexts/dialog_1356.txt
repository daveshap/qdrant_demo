INSPECTOR: What did you find out, Mike?
MIKE: I've been trailing the cashier like you told me. You're right about that guy, chief. There's something screwy somewhere.
INSPECTOR: Never mind all that. What did you find out?
MIKE: He left here about an hour ago and went down to Dude Finlay's joint.
INSPECTOR: Dude Finlay?
MIKE: Yes, sir.
