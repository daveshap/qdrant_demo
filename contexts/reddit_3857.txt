At what age should you worry if you have never met a woman who was interested in you?
22M Virgin here. People say you're young so you shouldn't worry about not being on a date. My question is then, when should I worry? When should I recognise there's a problem? Or should I never worry about not meeting a woman who is interested? Many thanks
