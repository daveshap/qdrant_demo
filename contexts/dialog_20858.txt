WILL: No! You gave your word!
BARBOSSA: Quite, boy, or you'll lose your tongue. Those as know me know I wouldn't cross my word, and bring down bad luck on the ship. I agreed to set them free. I didn't when ... nor where.
JACK: It's pure evil to make a Captain walk the plank of his own ship, twice in one lifetime. No good can come of it.
BARBOSSA: Now, Jack. That reef is less than a league distant. It's a square deal all around, and you can't hope for better.
JACK: Someone needs to cut these bonds, then.
BARBOSSA: You'd best take a swim, Jack.
JACK: The last time you do this, you left me a pistol, with one shot.
PINTEL: That's proper, sir, according to the code.
BARBOSSA: By the powers, you're right! Where's Jack's pistol? Who's got it? Bring it forward!
