TREVES: Has the response picked up?
CARR: Frankly, Treves, it's not what I'd expected. A few small cheques. Well- wishers. Don't worry, these things undoubtedly take time.
TREVES: But he's so afraid he's going to be carted off. I've promised him that won't happen.
CARR: Well... I'll let you know if there's something in the afternoon post.
TREVES: Please do.
