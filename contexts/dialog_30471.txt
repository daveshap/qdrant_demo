VIRIDIANA: Are they going to work here too?
JORGE: Don't worry. Nobody's going to disturb you.
JORGE: Don't forget the meeting with the lawyer. The car will pick you up tomorrow morning.
VIRIDIANA: I'll be ready.
JORGE: Do you intend to stay here for some time?
VIRIDIANA: Yes. Why?
JORGE: You can come and live again in the big house if you want. Now that I'm alone, I can settle down anywhere.
VIRIDIANA: And ...your friend?
JORGE: She's left.
VIRIDIANA: Is she coming back?
JORGE: No.
VIRIDIANA: Why?
