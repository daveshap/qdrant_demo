REILLY: HEY!!!
LINDENMEYER: Show's over unless I get to see what you've been working on after hours.
REILLY: I haven't been working on anything.
LINDENMEYER: Do I get to see it or not?
REILLY: Bastard... Sheila, don't go anywhere. I'll be right back.
SID 6.7: She's some of your finest work, Daryl.
LINDENMEYER: All my work is my finest.
LINDENMEYER: Get that fucking thing away from me!
REILLY: You're...such a wimp.
REILLY: Watching your VR people Auto Reset gave me the idea.
LINDENMEYER: It's nano—technology, isn't it? Machines the size of molecules...
REILLY: Coordinated by polymer neural net.
LINDENMEYER: It feels so.. .real.
REILLY: It's better than real. It's synthetic flesh. Synthetic blood. Synthetic organs... It's a physiological machine.
LINDENMEYER: This is supposed to be years away.
REILLY: As far as the public is concerned, it is. The reason you got fired, and I got my second demo into production, is I'm a lot smarter than you. I never give my best stuff away.
LINDENMEYER: How do you kill it?
REILLY: Separate the character module from the neural net...
REILLY: ... and you get nano—death. Don't worry, I've got a bunch of other ones.
LINDENMEYER: Amazing. I hate to say it, but it is.
REILLY: I know. I'm ready to incubate something a little more advanced than a coldblooded reptile. If you want to experience the future, meet me in my office in 15 minutes. And bring the Sheila 3.2 character module with you...
SID 6.7: You catching my drift?
LINDENMEYER: I think I understand what you have in mind...
LINDENMEYER: You need a maid.
REILLY: What I need is a nymphomaniac.
