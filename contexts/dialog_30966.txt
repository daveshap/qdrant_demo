TED: I genuinely think she wants me. I feel a vibe.
CHARLIE: That vibe is from your wrist, pal. You've been over-tenderizing your meat, again.
TED: See? Did you see that?
CHARLIE: She smiles at everyone, Ted. She's like a newborn with gas.
CHARLIE: The only chick more untouchable than Christy Malone is Miss April. Hi
TED: Were you always this sick?
CHARLIE: One thing for sure, Christy Malone ain't lookin THAT good naked.
TED: Someday, I'll find out.
CHARLIE: You have a better chance of being hit by a Mack truck with a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip.
TED: I defy your hamburger theory of life, and all of the unfulfilled hopes and dreams it represents.
CHARLIE: That's crazy talk.
TED: I defy any and all limits.
CHARLIE: Don't do it, Ted. Don't do it.
TED: Any time, any day, a man can completely reinvent himself.
