Moving points to the largest polygon within another polygon I need to move a large number of points (street addresses) into the largest polygon (a building, usually a house) within another polygon (taxlot).  The idea here is to put an address point into a house, not a garage or other outbuilding.  Its easy enough to use snap to put it into a building but it needs to be the right one and size seems to be the only option.  Shape_area has been calculated for each building.How would I go about doing this?  The solutions I've tried wind up putting some points into smaller buildings.License type = Advanced
