Job Probation
I didn't know where else to post it so hopefully someone here can help me.

&#x200B;

I just recently accepted a job that's in a different city about 3 hours from where I currently live. Being that I'm a new graduate, this is pretty exciting except for the move because I have a 3 month probation period. I know this is common practice, but how likely is it that I'm going to be fired within that time? I don't wanna settle down somewhere if they decide they don't like me and I also don't wanna treat this like a temporary job forever.
