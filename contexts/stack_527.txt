How to get Flash to play through HDMI I've had a litany of sound problems, in particular with Adobe Flash on Firefox. I can get most sounds to play through the TV speakers, which are connected to my Ubuntu laptop through HDMI, but I can't get Flash to do that. I can't right-click on Flash without crashing it. Just this last half hour, there was a period where Pulseaudio wasn't working, but Flash was still playing through the headphones, and then when I loaded another video Flash stopped playing sound while Pulseaudio started working again.How do I get Flash to play through HDMI?
