What is the basis of the use of Hermitian matrices as quantum gates? Because all quantum gates must be unitary matrices, it is possible to prove the no cloning theorem by showing that no quantum gate can output two identical copies of an arbitrary inputted qubit.This lead me to the question of why are quantum gates modeled using unitary matrices in the first place? Why does every action in a quantum system have to be reversible? Why does not being able to clone a qubit mean we can't clone a qutrit or any other quantum particle/configuration/system?Assuming these things is very useful in quantum computing, but I want to know what is the quantum mechanical basis of representing these things as solely unitary matrices and nothing else.EDIT: Clarified question.
