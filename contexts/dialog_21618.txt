ELIZABETH: They need to see the new 484's to make sure it works with their OC....
LENA: Ok. What should I do about Eric?
ELIZABETH: Just tell him to call me.
LENA: Ok.
ELIZABETH: So...did my brother call you?
LENA: No.
ELIZABETH: I have no idea what he's doing then. I'm sorry that didn't work out.
LENA: It's fine.
ELIZABETH: You wouldn't want to go out with him anyway, honestly, he's such a freak sometimes.
LENA: He did seem a little strange.
ELIZABETH: Well...he's not that strange, don't say that.
LENA: I'm sorry. You're right.
ELIZABETH: I think he's weird, but that's me.
LENA: Should I call you later?
ELIZABETH: I'll just see you when you get back here.
LENA: Ok.
LENA: Where do you have to go?
BARRY: For what?
LENA: For work.....
BARRY: I don't have any business here. I came here for you, I didn't have any business.
BARRY: How many times have you been on an airplane?
LENA: I think maybe over a hundred.
BARRY: That's right you travel so much.
LENA: Yeah.
