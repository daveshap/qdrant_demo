Beginner freelancer looking for good websites to freelance on
I'm a Computer Science student and i want to improve my skills and make money at the same time, i also figured that it would be an easier way to learn new things while I'm in college. i'm not really looking forward to making a lot of money in this. mostly looking forward to improving my skills but it'd be nice to have a little reward. what are good websites to freelance on?
