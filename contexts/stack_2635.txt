ArcGIS Server - Deleted service We are having a major issue. We are using ArcGIS Enterprise for our workgroup projects for multi-user editing. Long story short we had a project on a service and this morning it was gone. No trace of it whatsoever. I can't even find a file with the corresponding service name.I'm trying to figure out what happened. Is there a way to check a log of activity? Such as seeing what happened to different services, changes, publishes, deleted services and so on?This is a major problem in our office and we need to find out what happened and our periodic back-up does not cut it.
