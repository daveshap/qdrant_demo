No job, no friends, and family that sees me as a disappointment.
I know these type of posts are seen all the time so I donâ€™t expect a lot of interaction with mine. I just need a place to vent since I really have no one else to go to. Iâ€™ve felt like a loner for years now but Iâ€™m at my absolute lowest at the moment. The one companion of mine that I had for almost 8 years, my dog, passed away last month. I always said I wouldnâ€™t kill myself as long as he was here with me and now that heâ€™s gone I see no other reason to keep going. I graduated from college this past December and havenâ€™t been able to land a job since. Most days I just sit and play video games because I just get so angry at all the rejection from employers who say theyâ€™re hiring for entry level but require 2+ years of experience. I donâ€™t have any skills. I tried to learn programming but honestly Iâ€™m just not very tech savy and I just donâ€™t have enough time to learn before my situation gets worse. I feel like Iâ€™ve let my family down, especially my grandma and mom who sacrificed so much to get me to college. Killing myself would just be doing them a favor. At least I would no longer be a burden. The people I thought were my friends grew up and got lives and just abandoned me in the process. Only things that seems to keep me somewhat happy are sex and alcohol. I donâ€™t see myself being the type of person to commit suicide by hanging or an overdose but honestly if the rampant sex with strangers wonâ€™t kill me, the alcohol poisoning sure will. ðŸ™ƒ
