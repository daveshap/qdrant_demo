GUILD: Where were you?
NUNHEIM: Marian! Marian! Don't go! I'll behave! I'll do anything! Don't go, Marian!
NUNHEIM: Let me go! Let me bring her back. I can't get along without her. I'll bring her right back and I'll tell you anything you want to know. Let me go!
GUILD: Sit down! We didn't come here to watch you and that broad dance around a May pole. Where were you the afternoon the girl was killed?
NUNHEIM: I can't remember offhand, Lieutenant. Maybe I was over at Charlie's shooting pool. Maybe I was here. She'd remember.
GUILD: How'd you like to be thrown in the can on account of not remembering?
NUNHEIM: Just give me a minute.... I'll remember. I'm not stalling, Lieutenant. You know I always come clean with you. Gee, it'd serve me right if you had pinched me... that's the afternoon I was.... wait, I'll show you...!
GUILD: Well, what'd you think?
NICK: I think we're on the right track.
GUILD: Who're you calling?
NICK: I'm calling your office so you can send out a man to trail him. I want to see where he goes.
GUILD: Trail him! Trail who?
NICK: Nunheim!
