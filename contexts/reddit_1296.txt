Anyone else hate their birthday?
Today is my birthday. I’m not looking for attention I just need to vent. Every single year I dread my birthday. It’s like I wake up the day of with the false sense of expectation about “my special day” and then am terribly let down that it wasn’t made special. Does that make sense? I don’t want it to be special but still end up being let down. I hate it so much and wish it would just pass like any other day. I’m a grown ass adult and feel like a child because I would rather lay in bed all day than to expect people to make it special, then they try to make it special while just wishing they wouldn’t. It’s selfish, I know. I’m a mess.
