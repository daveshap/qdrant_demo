I m 27 and on a career break and feeling lost already, what should I do?
I started working in IT right after my college, worked there for almost 2 years and got a better offer with a nice salary package abroad with a reputable MNC. Worked there for a few months and felt depressed and abruptly decided to leave and come back to my country. Right now I am unemployed and kind of feeling lost.

I am thinking about re-skill/ upskill or may go for masters.

Any advice on my situation?
