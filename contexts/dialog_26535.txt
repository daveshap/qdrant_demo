LUTHOR: About Vesuvius. About Superman writhing in the bowels of the volcano. Ahh, the look on his face when he saw that Kryptonite. When will I see another, y'know? Y'know?
EVE: I don't like to talk about it, Lex.
LUTHOR: Weak sister. I still can't figure out why it took so long for you to catch up with us after we all ran out. Y'know?
EVE: You ever try to run in high heels? You probably did.
LUTHOR: Is that an innuendo, Miss Teschmacher? Because if it is, you are about to experience the heady thrill of being hurled from a moving vehicle.
LUTHOR: Ready?
EVE: Ready.
