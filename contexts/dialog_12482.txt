TREVOR: We startred off to be. She was, I guess I was. I just sort of....butchered up the relationship somehow. Bad choice of words.
ALLISON: I understand, I think. Other women?
TREVOR: Yeah. It's like I was a different guy then I am today. I can't remember that guy. I see these women, they think I'm someone else, and I'm not that guy anymore. I'm not sure who Kristy knew.
ALLISON: You were unfaithful, it sounds like your confessing.
TREVOR: I did more then that.
TREVOR: Lucky for us these chairs happened to be here.
ALLISON: Oh I knew about the chairs already. This is where the emphysema patients come to sneak cigarettes.
ALLISON: Don't tell me. Kirsty used to smoke?
TREVOR: No. She just would have loved it up here... Allison when I was under... did I ever talk?
