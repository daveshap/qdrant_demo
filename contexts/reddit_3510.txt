Is it bad to take a shit before a date?
I have some social anxiety and am not used to dating. In informal social settings, I tend to shake, but this is not a problem anytime else (like for work social settings or meeting new friends). Is it bad that I take a shot before dates? I asked a bouncer at a pre-date location to take a shot and he criticized me constructively. But my logic is, people who have anxiety take meds often, I just need one shot to loosen up for dates. Is that bad? 

I know how pathetic this sounds.... Trust me, I wish I was a rockstar and if it wasn’t for my anxiety, I would be super outgoing. :( but I’m too embarrassed of my shaking and I avoid dates because of it.
