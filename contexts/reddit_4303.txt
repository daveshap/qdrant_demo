Dating in a Pandemic
Honestly, I think dating in a pandemic puts a strain on almost every relationship. Whether you live together, are dating, married etc, everyone seems to be having some type of strain on their relationship. Mine, in particular, I have an issue trusting (due to trust issues in the past) but that's something I'm trying to slowly work on. 

How do you guys work through the insecurities in your relationship and how do you convey to your partner your issues? I tend to hold everything inside until it all bursts (also something I am trying to work on) - I just don't like feeling vulnerable and giving him that chance to hurt me. It's honestly quite terrifying. How do I learn to trust him more?
