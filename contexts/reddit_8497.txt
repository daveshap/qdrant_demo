The US Constitution Article 1 Section 3 appears to have a disqualification clause, in addition to and separate from conviction, possibly not requiring the extra hurdle of a 2/3rds majority. Could this be used in the impeachment of Donald Trump?
Speaking of the powers and duties of the Senate, the [US Constitution Article 1 Section 3 states](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution-transcript#toc-section-3-):

> Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office, **and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States**: but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law. 

[Justia provides some further background](https://law.justia.com/constitution/us/article-2/49-judgment-removal-and-disqualification.html), speaking of the link between conviction and removal:

> the Senate determined that removal is automatic upon conviction, and does not require a separate vote... only as a result of a two-thirds vote.

it further states for disqualification:

> **Unlike removal, disqualification from office is a discretionary judgment, and there is no explicit constitutional linkage to the two-thirds vote on conviction. Although an argument can be made that disqualification should nonetheless require a two-thirds vote, the Senate has determined that disqualification may be accomplished by a simple majority vote**

Many seem to think it unlikely that enough Republicans in the Senate will break rank from the party and vote in favor of convicting Donald Trump for anything. However, should disqualification be brought to the table, it may only require a simple majority and therefore only 4 Republican Senators to break party rank.

* How does disqualification get proposed?
* When has disqualification been used separate from conviction in the past?
* Are Democrats aware of/think disqualification would be a viable strategy?
* Would successful disqualification actually prevent Donald Trump from running for reelection?
* What is the role of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell? For example, like other actions in the Senate, can he choose if disqualification can get brought to the floor for vote during impeachment?
