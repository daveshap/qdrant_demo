HARRY: Oh, yeah. Well I almost always beat Captain Rob.
LLOYD: Who's Captain Rob?
HARRY: Just a guy I hang out with.
LLOYD: I know the type. Lives in the basement, smells like a sponge...
HARRY: No! Captain Rob is seven feet tall, wears an eye patch, got a hook for a hand...
LLOYD: Sounds like a pirate.
HARRY: What? No no. He's got a parrot on his shoulder, buries treasure...
LLOYD: Yeah, he's a pirate.
HARRY: I don't think so. This guy drinks rum from a barrel, says yo ho ho" has a peg leg..."
LLOYD: Peg leg?
HARRY: Yeah, go-cart accident.
LLOYD: Exactly! A pirate!
HARRY: If he heard you talking like that he'd make you walk the plank. Three, two, one. Now it's your turn, spin.
LLOYD: A-ha! You landed on Candyland! Now swallow it!
