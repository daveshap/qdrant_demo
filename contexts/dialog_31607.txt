KELLY: Ms. Grey -- you work at a school for mutants in Westchester, New York. Can you tell the members of this committee what exactly you are teaching these mutants?
JEAN: Math. History. Science. English. Athletics --
KELLY: You wouldn't happen to be teaching them how to use their powers to --
JEAN: Control, Senator... we teach them control.
KELLY: This was taken by a state police officer in Secaucus, New Jersey. A man in a minor altercation literally melted the car in front of him. I don't know where you come from, Ms. Grey, but where I come from, you don't go melting people's cars when they cut you off. You do it the old fashioned way -- you give 'em the finger. But what you presume to tell this committee -
JEAN: I presume nothing, I am here to tell you that in time, the mutator gene will activate in every living human being on this planet. Perhaps even your children, Senator.
KELLY: I can assure you, there is no such creature in my genes.
