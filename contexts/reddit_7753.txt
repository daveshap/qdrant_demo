Blog?
Howdy!
I was wondering how different fields feel about the idea of academic blogging. I study comp. bio. so it's fairly common for people to put up fun little projects online or put up little programming tricks and the like. 

Anybody here maintain a Blog? if so, what sort of stuff do you blog about? If not, why not and would you ever consider it?

Best!
