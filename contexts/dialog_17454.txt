PARRISH: This is crazy -- you're not going to eat dinner with us.
YOUNG MAN: Bill, I am eating dinner with you. And your family. And that's what we're doing. It's not open for discussion. Nothing is. Don't you understand?
PARRISH: Excuse me? Could I say something?
YOUNG MAN: Of course.
PARRISH: It just occurred to me --
YOUNG MAN: Speak up, please.
PARRISH: When I introduce you, if I say who you are, I don't think anyone will stay for dinner.
YOUNG MAN: Then don't.
