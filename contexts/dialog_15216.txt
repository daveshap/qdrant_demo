CARRIE: I'm scared. A week ago you would never have even thought to pick up that gun. This afternoon you're out there wielding it around like Clyde fucking Barrow, for Christ's sake! What's with you?
BRIAN: Okay, it was a cheap thrill, it was stupid, I admit it, alright? But let's not blow this. Not now... Let's just get the photos.
CARRIE: I can't believe I agreed to do this.
BRIAN: Oh come on, don't give me that shit... you wanted to take these photos as much as I wanted you too.
CARRIE: Wrong! I was willing to do whatever it took to get you up off your ass and on the way to California... There's a big difference.
CARRIE: Brian I want him out of our car!
BRIAN: Why, what did he do?
CARRIE: Brian get him out of the car. Next gas station either he leaves or I do!
