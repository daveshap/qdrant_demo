Electromagnetic field propagation in any medium at high frequency I am trying to understand an important concept regarding the propagation of EM fields in materials at high frequencies, which is:<blockquote>  \"At high frequencies any material behaves as a dielectric material. This is because the displacement current dominates the conduction current and the EM field propagates as a wave instead of being diffused\"</blockquote>Please, someone explain this statement in a detailed way or give me sources to understand it. This statement is from the following paper:\"Principles of Mine Detection by Ground-penetrating Radar\" by Motoyuki Sato
