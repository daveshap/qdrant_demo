Grad School Advice
Hello all. 
Looking for some advice.  I applied and was denied admission to a Master of Education in Higher Education Administration program.  I am planning on applying again next year, but was looking at this [Student Affairs in Higher Education Certificate](http://www.ecu.edu/cs-educ/idp/aded/SA_Cert.cfm) (online program) and thinking about taking the program to boost my chances of admission into the Master program.  Does this seem reasonable or is there any other ideas that might be able to boost my application. 


&nbsp;

I have worked for the past 4 years in the Student Affairs office for a Medical School and would like to working in advising and/or registration. I do a bit of both currently. Also, are there any other degrees that could give me a leg up on these areas?  I have a graduate certificate in Counselor Education, but was thinking about [College Counseling and Student Development](https://ced.ncsu.edu/programs/college-counseling-and-student-development-master/) as a possible alternative. Any other degree ideas would be helpful.   Thanks in advance.
