My almost 2 years relationship ended
I can't accept the fact that its ended. Its like, she is still there. I don't have friends, I dont have anyone but her, so i don't know what to do. I was prepared for this. So I have no intentions of runing after her. But I miss her, I miss how we were. She just sid ''I don't have feelings for you anymore.''.

I always felt unworthy, and unloveable. But now, I dont even know if I have a life worth to live... Is it toxic, am i being obsessed...??
