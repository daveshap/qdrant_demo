NEO: What are they doing to him?
TANK: They're hacking his mind.
NEO: How?
TANK: They inject virus-like serums to attack the neuro-systems. It's like cracking a computer. All it takes is time.
NEO: How much time?
TANK: Depends on the mind. But eventually, it will crack and his alpha pattern will change from this to this.
TANK: When it does, Morpheus will tell them anything they want to know.
NEO: What do they want?
TANK: Every leader of every ship is given the codes to Zion's mainframe computer which can be accessed only through the Matrix. They are used only in emergencies. If an agent had those codes and got inside Zion's mainframe they could disable the entire defense system. It would be the end of everything.
