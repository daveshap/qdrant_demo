MRS. HALLIGAN: —for the rheumatism, you know.
INSPECTOR: What time was it, Mrs. Halligan?
MRS. HALLIGAN: It was late, I know. The Dooley sisters was already in. They work at a show, you know.
INSPECTOR: What time was it?
MRS. HALLIGAN: Huh?
INSPECTOR: What time did Matt Brown get in?
MRS. HALLIGAN: Now, let me see - a half hour after the Dooley sisters - and the Dooley sisters never get home until after—
INSPECTOR: I don't care about the Dooley sisters - what time did he get in?
MRS. HALLIGAN: That's just what I'm trying to tell you, sir. It was a half hour after the Dooley sisters . . .
INSPECTOR: Was it twelve o'clock?
