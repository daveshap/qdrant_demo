I ain't afraid of no ghost...
Long story short: Met this girl at a gig I played two and a half months ago. Asked her out, we go out on quite a few dates, we bang, we meet families and continue dating once a week until this past Sunday. I ask her to hang again...radio silence. Can someone explain this to me? Legit, I spend all this time getting know someone and this is how they choose to end things...I'm shook...I'm spooked.
