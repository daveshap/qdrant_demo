my friend has a giant crush on me and its starting to make me uncomfortable (sorry this is long)
i have had this friend since my freshman year (we are seniors now) and we used to have a crush on eachother and flirted, but then i got over it and we kind of grew apart. he still had a crush on me the next year, even though i had a boyfriend but he never made a move, so i forgot about it.

later we ended up in the same friend group, and i thought he got over the crush, but i was wrong. hes also my manager at work now, and he gives me more hours than anyone, rearranges the schedule unfairly so i can call out last minute, etc. my coworkers have noticed it and its making them mad, and its effecting my friend group too.

the worst part is my friends decided we want to get eachother presents for Christmas, and apparently he got me something worth way more than anyone elses. 

he keeps asking to hang out alone and i either just say no or make up am excuse, because i know he wants to ask me out, but im not interested in him like that at all. he doesnt take a hint, and is super vague when he tries to "ask me out", and he gets upset when i hang out with others alone but not him.

i dont know what to do when he gives me his present, and i dont know what to say when he asks me out, and i sure as hell dont know what to do about work. he wont take a hint even though its pretty clear rhat im not into him, and its going to be so embarrassing to do this, i feel so bad.

does anyone have any advice, or has ever been in a similar situation?? thanks !!!

edit: he sexually assaulted me cut off creeps when they show red flags
