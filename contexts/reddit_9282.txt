I have 28 cents in the bank after paying my bills.
But I managed to put almost 60 bucks in savings, paid 30 bucks extra on my car payment, and pay my car insurance and phone bill for this month AND next month.
Small victories lads:)

Edit: wow! My first reddit gold. Thank you! Never thought this post would blow up like it has. Thank all of you for the kind words and encouragement! Were all gonna make it!
