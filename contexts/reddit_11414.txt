Stood up 3 times in the past week. Physical pain. Emotional pain. I am starting to feel like I honestly can't do this anymore.
I've been single for 3 years now out of a 2.5 year relationship. I've tried dating since the first year after I got out of that relationship, only to be stood up / rejected. 

I'm starting to feel like in a world where "there are plenty fish in the sea" I'm the one person who can't find one. 

Above and beyond that I've got (what I believe to be, but hasn't been officially diagnosed) arthritis and at 21 years of age living with my parents still.... They think I'm making excuses. Every day I stand up I get jolting pains in my hips, my legs, my elbows, fingers ... You name it and its in pain. 

I'm mentally wore out from school. I've been told before "straight A's or get out of my fucking house" as it's my dad who's a slave to his 12 hour a day 7 day a week 52 weeks a year job. 

I don't have anyone to vent to, and keeping all this bottled inside is really taking a toll. 

If anyone read this at all, thanks.
