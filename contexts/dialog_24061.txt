CHRISTY: What'd she say?
EDDIE: You blew it -- big time. She doesn't want you back.
CHRISTY: Does she know people are trying to kill me out there?
EDDIE: She's counting on it. She's concerned for your safety, but she wants me to try and find another convent that will take you. Or a carnival.
CHRISTY: So what am I supposed to do in the meantime?
EDDIE: Go in and talk to her. It can't hurt. Go.
CHRISTY: So... hi there.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: I don't believe we have anything to say to each other.
CHRISTY: Look... I know I shouldn't have, I'm incredibly sorry about Mary Robert, I wasn't thinking, I didn't know that would happen!
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Mary Robert's life was in danger! Your behavior was inexcusable!
CHRISTY: I know! I'm sorry I didn't mean for it to happen! And I was the one they were shooting at!
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Mary Clarence, I have given you every opportunity. To change. To make a decent life for yourself.
CHRISTY: A decent life? Excuse me? As what? A janitor?
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Clearly, you have learned nothing. And you present an ongoing threat, both to this convent and to yourself.
CHRISTY: But you can't kick me out! Guys want to kill me! You're a nun! A big nun! Aren't you supposed to have compassion? For the wayward sheep? I mean, I'm a major sinner! All-time great! Hall of Fame! Aren't I, like, your dream come true? Your Olympic event?
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Mary Clarence, perhaps you are correct.
CHRISTY: I am?
MOTHER SUPERIOR: You may stay. But I shall restrict your activities to but a single task.
CHRISTY: What?
MOTHER SUPERIOR: You have, I believe, some minimal background in music. Therefore, you are to join our choir.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: You will sing, and you will sleep,' that is your schedule until you depart. As almost no one attends Mass, you will be unable to cause further damage.
CHRISTY: No. No.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: You're my Olympic event.
CHRISTY: Not the choir, please, anything but that. The choir -- I mean, have you heard them? I'll do anything, scrub floors, toilets, you name it, but not that I
MOTHER SUPERIOR: The choir, Mary Clarence. Go for the gold.
CHRISTY: Is this... choir practice?
MARY PATRICK: Sure is! Come on in, and sing a spell.
CHRISTY: Mary Robert, I am so sorry about last night...
MARY ROBERT: Now stop that. You didn't shoot at me. You were only trying to help, to give me experience. I tried to explain that to Reverend Mother, but -- I don't know if she understood.
MARY LAZARUS: Soprano or alto?
CHRISTY: Whatever.
JOEY: We're looking for Mike.
MIKE: You found him -- but we're not open yet.
