Humanity is the worst race to be a part of
We are like enslaved cows, we are born forced to go to school to "get education" so that we can be "successful", then we must word 9 hours a day to be able to live peacefully and those who are out of that format are either lucky or homeless. I am too a part of that format. Recently found someone that cares about me(a girlfriend) but i just can find the place in my heart to like her. She is amazing and beutiful yet i cant stop looking at other girls and wishing they were intrested in me. Im stressed as fuck from school and it all doesnt seem worth. Adult life does not look good. at all.
I dont have the guts to do it to my family thought. I just wish the world would end
