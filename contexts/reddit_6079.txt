In-person Interview During Pandemic
Hello everybody,

I  have been asked to come in for an in-person interview for a food-testing/quality control lab position. It concerns me that the employer has asked me to do this given the quarantine order. Should this be  a red flag? My immediate thought is the company must not care very much about their employees let alone their social responsibility during the pandemic. However, maybe this is more normal than I realize?

What are you thoughts? I am still getting paid from my old job through July, and I would love opportunity to have some overlapping paychecks. However, the job does only pay $15/hr, and part of me is thinking I shouldn't even bother given their disregard of the pandemic.
