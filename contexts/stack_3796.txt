data imputation of missing values in non-normally distributed explanatory variables I have been told that mean imputation of missing values is inappropriate when the variables underlying distribution is non-normal. my variable is contiunous (but bound at 100) and most observations are either 98 or 99 (with the odd few in the lower 90's), hence the distribution is highly skewed. how would i best input for missing values?
