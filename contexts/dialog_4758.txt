SAM: A cheque.
KURTZMAN: The refund for Tuttle!
SAM: Tuttle?
KURTZMAN: I mean, Buttle! It's been confusion from the word go! He's been wrongly charged for Electromemorytherapy and someone somewhere is trying to make us carry the can!
SAM: I've never seen a Ministry cheque before.
KURTZMAN: We've got to get rid of it! There's been a balls-up somewhere, and when the music stops they'll jump on whoever's holding the cheque!
SAM: Send it to somebody else. Send it to Buttle. It's his cheque.
KURTZMAN: I've tried that! Population Census have got him down as dormanted, the Central Collective Storehouse computer has got him down as deleted, and the Information Retrieval have got him down as inoperative ... Security has him down as excised., Admin have him down as completed
SAM: Hang on.
SAM: He is dead.
KURTZMAN: Dead! Oh no! That's terrible! We'll never get rid of the damned thing! What are we going to do?
SAM: Try next of kin.
KURTZMAN: Next of kin!
SAM: There we go. Mrs. Veronica Buttle. What's the number on the cheque?
KURTZMAN: 27156789/074328/K.
