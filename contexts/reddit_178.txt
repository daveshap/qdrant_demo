my new gf
ok so i have a new girlfriend. we have been going out for 3 weeks and we have hung out 5 times. We knew each other prior to getting together for a long time. As we all know, christmas is around the corner and i would like to get her a gift. Would, at this time, a piece of jewelry be appropriate? The item in question is just a small sliver bracelet. Is this too much too soon? Is it not enough? Someone with experience please help.
