Any advice or suggestions welcome
Okay, i’m a junior attending high school. just for a baseline of this story. i was in orchestra, not the best at what i played, the viola, and not quite passionate about it either. then, i fell into a new friend group and i picked up a snare pad for the first time about a year ago and it opened my eyes to a whole new spectrum of music. drumming. from there, i proceeded to take “ lessons “ with a very good percussionist from my high school and he was able to convince me to join the marching band. i joined the drum line and absolutely loved it, i marched quads, i still had a passion for snare but i grew to love quads. i then started to get into drumming on a drum set and from there it’s grown into a burning passion of mine to drum. my dilemma however, i dropped out of orchestra because it wasn’t quite the musical exposure i needed/wanted. the conductor isn’t the best i’ve seen and the music wasn’t challenging. Alls that i’ve wanted from the very second that i learned of my love and passion for the drums is to be recognized as a drummer, even a percussionist if you will. but, any music director, outside of marching band, refuses to see me as anything but a mediocre violist. What should i do?
