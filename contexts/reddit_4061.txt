Another "I'm tired of dating" rant
I'm just tired of dating. I'm 30, apparently I'm a "catch", but I can't find a guy that I'm compatible with. I'm tired of going through boyfriends. I'm tired of online dating, it's just... gross most of the time. I'm tired of meeting men with significant emotional issues. Lately it seems like all the guys I'm meeting are abusive, have porn addiction issues, attachment issues, only want casual hookups, have unreasonable expectations, etc. etc.

I'm taking a time out from dating. I'm happy being alone, and I'd rather be single and doing my own thing than settle for someone/something that wouldn't make me happy. It's just weird to hit your 30s and see all your friends/family in long term, serious relationships while you're just... alone.

(As an aside, I know there are still great guys out there, and I know hetero men struggle with dating too. This is just me ranting about my current situation.)
