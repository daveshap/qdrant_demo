KIRK: Uhura, any response from Starfleet on our Project Genesis inquiries?
UHURA: No, sir, no response.
KIRK: Hmm.. Very odd. Scotty. Progress report?
SCOTTY: I'm almost done, sir. You'll be fully automated by the time we dock.
KIRK: Your timing is excellent, Mr. Scott. You've fixed the barn door after the horse has come home. How much refit time till we can take her out again?
SCOTTY: Eight weeks, sir. But you don't have eight weeks so I'll do it for ya in two.
KIRK: Mr. Scott. Have you always multiplied your repair estimates by a factor of four?
SCOTTY: Certainly, sir. How else can I keep my reputation as a miracle worker?
KIRK: Your reputation is secure, Scotty. Mr. Sulu, take the con. I'll be in my quarters.
