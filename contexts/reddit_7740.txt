Thoughts on Preparing Future Faculty program?
Hi all - I'm meeting with my university's Preparing Future Faculty coordinator/representative soon to get more information/decide if it's something I should pursue. If you or anyone you know have participated in the program, I'd be interested in learning more about your experience. TIA!

Disclaimer: I know the program varies from institution to institution. I'm just trying to get a sense of individuals' overall impressions :)
