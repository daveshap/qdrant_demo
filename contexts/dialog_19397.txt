DAY-DAY: You make it sound so easy.
CRAIG: It is easy. You know why? 'Cause they're not expecting it. Now, Roach, you gotta occupy Cheeco. Long enough for me and Day-Day to take a good look.
ROACH: Dude, dogs hate me. I don't know why. Me and K-9's just don't get along.
CRAIG: Well get along with this one. Go ahead of us. Don't get seen and don't let that mutt out of your sight.
ROACH: Fuck, what's his name?
CRAIG: Cheeco.
