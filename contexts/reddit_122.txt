I don’t feel the same way back and idk how to deal with it
one of my guy friends has recently confessed to me and i genuinely do not know what to do. he’s been very open about it and i appreciate it but at the same time i feel kinda weirded out? i’m not sure how to describe it but i know it’s different. we had a thirty minute talk a couple of days ago and i told him i can’t feel the same way back but he didn’t really listen to that but rather went on how much he liked me and what he liked about me. i consider him a best friend and he likes me and i don’t know what to do because i don’t want to straight out ignore him but i don’t want to continuously hang out with him before because i feel like that would give him the wrong idea.
