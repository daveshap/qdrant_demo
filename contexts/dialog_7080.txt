LOGAN: Ever notice how cats always seem to turn up around dinner time?
MAX: I won't be staying.
LOGAN: I'm not a half bad cook.
MAX: Like following me around and pestering the people I work with wasn't bad enough, but breaking into my apartment--
LOGAN: It was open.
MAX: You got a lotta nerve.
LOGAN: Me? You're the one who tried to rip off this piece.
MAX: Completely different situation. I steal things in order to sell them. For money. It's called commerce. But some stranger sneaking into a girl's bedroom is...bent.
LOGAN: Bent?
MAX: Bent.
LOGAN: You make it sound I pawed through your priceless collection of underwear.
MAX: How do I know you didn't?
LOGAN: So saw my hands off, I left you a present.
MAX: Am I s'posed to be grateful?
LOGAN: That would be appropriate, yes.
MAX: How'm I s'posed to ever sleep there again knowing some pervo's probably touched everything I own?
LOGAN: You're that nervous, you're welcome to stay here.
MAX: Whoa there, Tex! We've been through all this.
LOGAN: It's alright, Peter, we're fine.
MAX: We are not fine.
