No Personality At All.
Do you ever feel that people online dating don’t have a personality at all? I wonder what goes through their mind to pick you but when you want to chat about things and get to know one another, they just don’t respond or just don’t give it their time to actually meet someone or at least get to know that person.

Kinda frustrating that in this day and age we have devices that communicate in a split second.
