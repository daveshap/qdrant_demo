I want to catch the feels.
I want to love again, I want to openly fall for someone without the fear of being labeled as that "clingy" girl

I want to trust and to feel excited and hopeful and not to have it all ripped away from me time and time again 

I don't want to be the cool girl, the "independent" or "prude" girl

I just want to fucking date you

You asshole.


Sincerely, my bottle of vodka

edit: because I don't want this to be a bashing post, honestly I still think DTR-ing ASAP is the best move (guy or girl) and that if the person you are open with doesn't reciprocate those feelings, they aren't worth it anyway because they aren't on the same page. Dating is rough but we still have some control over protecting our feelings and if you do everything in your power to do that all you can do is down a bottle of vodka, say fuck you, and realize there is better out there. Love you all and wish you the best <3
