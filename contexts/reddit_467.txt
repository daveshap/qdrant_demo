How do I talk to this boy?
Hey ya'll, I hope ya'll can help me on this one! As a young girl and young adult, my mother and father never let me have a boyfriend or even a guy friend in general, so I never have had experience speaking with guys long term, if that makes any sense. Plus, I believe since I was sexually assaulted it just made me stay clear from any man in my life, so I never had a strong friendship or love interest even though I wished I did. I am very uncomfortable and weary about speaking to any guys, and I get very easily scared but I want to break this cycle. 

I moved to college as a freshman a few weeks ago, so I am super far away from home (which was intentional) and I want to be able to venture out in the world of boys. Not even for boyfriends, I just really want some guy friends in my life. So, my first target to befriend is a guy who I only spoke to for a few minutes to ask a question which took me a lot of guts to be honest, since I am also very insecure. Yet he was really nice and seemed like a genuine person- so this leads to the question. 

How do I talk to him now? We only have one class together and it's a college success class, and we don't share the same major even though he has the major I would love to pursue (can't though). How do I start a conversation and go about it, and would it be weird to even start one this far into the semester? I just don't know how to talk to guys, and it makes me awkward so a little help would be splendid. Thank you!
