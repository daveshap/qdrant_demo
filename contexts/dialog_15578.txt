GENERAL CHIANG: You must also do something about the public meetings. I see this, memorandum circulating, with Tibetan grievances.
LUKHANGWA: You have cracked a man's skull and that crack has not healed. It is too soon to expect him to be your friend.
GENERAL CHIANG: We are simply respecting the terms of the Seventeen Point Agreement.
LUKHANGWA: Are you, General?
GENERAL CHIANG: We want 2,000 more tons of barley distributed.
LUKHANGWA: Impossible! You will bring famine down on the people of Tibet with these insatiable demands! More food, the best land for your soldiers to camp.
GENERAL CHIANG: The People's Liberation Army pays for all food and lodging.
LUKHANGWA: So far, they do. But, the quantity, it does not exist. You will have to re-evaluate your needs.
GENERAL CHIANG: How much tea do you drink, Prime Minister?
LUKHANGWA: It depends on the quality. And, that it be Indian.
LUKHANGWA: Why is it necessary for the Chinese to keep so many soldiers in Lhasa?
GENERAL CHIANG: To protect. To serve you. Chairman Mao wants you to feel that China belongs to you now.
LUKHANGWA: Chairman Mao can keep China. Just give us back Tibet.
GENERAL CHIANG: Plans for absorbing the Tibetan army into the People's Army will soon be finalized.
LUKHANGWA: I will not approve it.
GENERAL CHIANG: Then, we will begin with replacing the Tibetan flag with the flag of the Motherland.
LUKHANGWA: And we will begin with tearing it down.
