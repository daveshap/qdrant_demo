FRANK: That takes care of this week. The tenth we got the Sheraton, the sixteenth we're at the Capri.
JACK: The tenth's out.
FRANK: What?
JACK: I can't make the tenth.
FRANK: What do you mean?
JACK: I mean maybe you should check with us before you go off and book us a month in advance.
FRANK: Be reasonable, Jack.
JACK: I play two hundred nights a year with you, Frank. How much more reasonable you expect me to be?
FRANK: How about you? Got a Bar Mitzvah this weekend?
SUSIE: Huh?
FRANK: Forget it.
