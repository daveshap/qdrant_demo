what job is good to start with that wont interfere with school?
So i want to get a job to save money for college and also not depend on going "mom can i have some money????" But in contrast my parents dont want me to think that my life has to revolve around my job and that wont hurt my academics. So for my academics im in my seinor year and i only need B's to pass since i finished all my credits, i only need US gov and english. I tried to apply to micheals and they havent said anything, im thinking about applying as a hostess

TL;DR I want a job but i dont want it to hurt my grades at school
