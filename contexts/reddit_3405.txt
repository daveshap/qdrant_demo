A girl asked me out! So surprised!
I was really surprised, because I've heard that girls very very rarely make the first move. She asked me if I'd like to hang out with her after quarantine gets over. 

She also explicitly mentioned that she really likes me :)

Fingers crossed people! Waiting for quarantine to get over ASAP
