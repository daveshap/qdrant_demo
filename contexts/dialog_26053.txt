LENNY: Faith OK?
MAX: Yeah. She's leaving with Tran so I got to boogie. Real quick... Iris checked into the Sheraton last night under a false name. Paid cash.
LENNY: Looks like she was holding out.
MAX: Yup. Hey, so I heard you dropped in on Tran last night. Another slick Lenny move.
LENNY: He's in this somehow... I don't know how. Just stay close to Faith.
MAX: I'm on her, amigo. No worries. Gotta jam.
MACE: Whatup Lenny?
LENNY: Jesus, Mace!
MACE: Where we going?
LENNY: Anywhere. We'll talk about it in the car.
