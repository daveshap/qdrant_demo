Remember the guy last year who had a 3gallon bottle and wanted to see how much he could save??
[that was me](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/agbx0n/instead_of_the_5_challenge_i_thought_id_try_an/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) hey, hi, how y’all doing?

So this is the update to my endeavor and before I continue the story, I want to preface this with: **I AM NOT POSTING FOR PITY.** I know there was quite a few people who were intrigued and invested in my experiment, and I wanted to give an update to what happened.

Basically, the task was for me to try and save whatever clinky change I had and money I would have spent on lotto tickets and essentially, the task failed successfully.

The bucket ended up actually helping me out in the end because late July 2019, my mother had a fall and broke both ankles.

Needless to say, it kicked off two of the hardest, stressful, and needlessly painful months of my life.

She would spent a month in hospital, spent time and rehab, home, back to the hospital all the while my family my family fighting with Medicare, transportation services, and equipment renters and failing to be able to provide a basic level of care in her condition.

This would be the straw to break the camels back and she would ultimately decide to quit dialysis and come home on hospice where within 3 days she would be gone.

So what does any of this have to do with me managing my money? I’ll tell yah.

My bucket came in handy because suddenly I was driving from work, to hospitals and a rehab center which mean a lot of gas, and a fuckton of tolls.

What little I had initially saved helped, and it became more like a contingency savings account because as anyone who’s paid biweekly knows- getting paid twice a month FUCKING BLOWS.

So it helped insure that when all my bills were paid, I would have gas and toll money and even some to bring my mom lunch or dinner.

So where do I stand now? The bucket is empty save for some pennies. Basically, the experiment has ceased being of my utmost concern because even now nearly 4 months later, I’m still wading my way out of the grieving process and have been throwing any money I do have extra towards student loans, paying off my credit card, my car payment, and a new mattress.

But since this is a story I guess I should give it some moralistic ended and I think it would be: expect the unexpected, and don’t be afraid to change your plans. Sometimes accidents is how we obtain results.

Will I try it again? Probably not for a while, but if I do, I’ll let y’all know.
