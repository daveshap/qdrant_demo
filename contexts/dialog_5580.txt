DIL: Wondered why you came on to me like that when you gave me the look.
FERGUS: He asked me to see were you all right.
DIL: See, I fix on anyone that's nice to me. Just the littlest bit nice and I'm yours.
FERGUS: Stop it, Dil --
DIL: Just don't kick Dil and she'll be touched. Be nice to her and she'll be yours forever.
DIL: See, I should blow you away, Jimmy. But I can't do that. Yet.
FERGUS: Let me go, Dil
DIL: Why?
FERGUS: Got to be somewhere.
DIL: Try and go, then.
