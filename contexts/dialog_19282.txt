CASE: Can you get us into Straylight?
AEROL: Gettin' in is easy. It's getting out I'm thinkin' of.
CASE: If there's a Babylon, man, that's it. We leave her in there, she ain't comin' out, steppin' razor or not.
MAELCOM: So be it, we cross into Babylon like a cool breeze.
CASE: I an' I, man. I an' I.
DIXIE: Where the hell have you been?
CASE: We got problems topside.
DIXIE: Well, it ain't exactly a bed of roses down here. We gonna run or not?
CASE: We run. You crack the pattern?
DIXIE: Yeah, but it ain't doing us any good. The way this is set up, I can't run shit unless I get inside its perimeter... and this goddamn thing would see me comin' from a mile away.
CASE: You can make your move when it comes after me.
DIXIE: What are you talkin' about?
CASE: I'll let it access me. That'll give you a free shot. Make it a good one. Dix.
