CARTER: How were things between you and Frank?
MARGARET: He was all right to me.
CARTER: Nothing more? Just another feller?
MARGARET: Nicer than most.
CARTER: But he was just another feller, wasn't he?
MARGARET: Yes.
CARTER: Though nicer than most?
MARGARET: Yes. I can't help the way I am.
CARTER: Why'd you see him so regular?
MARGARET: Once a week?
CARTER: I call that regular.
MARGARET: He was gentlemanly. I like that.
CARTER: Once a week you like a gentleman?
MARGARET: Look, I'm me, right. You're not. We are what we are, like it or not. Why all the bloody needle?
CARTER: What was bugging Frank?
MARGARET: He wanted me to leave Dave and marry him. Last Friday I told him it wouldn't work. Dave would have killed us both! He followed me home and kicked up a stink in the street, I had to tell Frank I couldn't see him any more. It was getting too dodgy. That was on Sunday. He said he'd kill himself. I was frightened what you might do.
CARTER: I don't believe you, Margaret. Frank wasn't like that. I'm the villain in the family, remember?
MARGARET: It's the truth.
MARGARET: It is. Honestly.
CARTER: You bloody whore. Frank was too careful to die like that. Who killed him?
MARGARET: I don't know nothing.
