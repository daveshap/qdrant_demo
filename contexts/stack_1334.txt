Generic glue-up shower wall panels? I installed a 32x32-feet inch shower pan. The shower has walls on three sides. I was planning to install glue-up plastic panels for the shower walls, but all the ones I can find at the big box stores are either shockingly expensive or won't fit.So, I'm wondering if there's a generic type of material I could cut to size and install using construction adhesive. For instance, could I just buy 4x8-foot PVC sheets?I know I could also do wall tile on cement board, but this is a rental property and I don't want to spend a lot of time and money.
