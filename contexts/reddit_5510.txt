Am I able to work at a car dealership + what would the benefits be?
Im a 16 year old who hopes to be able to buy a Jeep in the next year (my parents are willing to pay 25% of the cost). I was thinking of ways to make up the remaining $18000ish dollars as quickly as possible, I already have about $4000 invested in stock and Iâ€™ve gotten positive gains out of that. My mom said I should try working at a Jeep dealership to earn some more money and gain the benefit of getting a discount on a Jeep. Would a Jeep dealership hire a 16 year old and would I get a discount? If so, how much?
