Don’t study in Europe unless you are comfortable living in another country!!!
Yes, European (not referring to UK) schools hand out degrees for a very cheap price or almost free. But please please don’t decide to study in Europe only for the price factor. 

1) Not all universities offer English degree programmes 
2) Living in another country means living around another language
3) Yes most europeans speak english but keep in mind that not everything will be in english. Rent contracts, utility bills, public transport information, govt documents etc. will all be in the native language 
4) You can’t expect everybody to want to speak english with you; I would recommend trying to learn the native language & customs. 

also, general public opinion toward US politics and America in this political climate is negative. If you are a staunch supporter of Trump, I wouldn’t count on meeting a lot people with a similar sentiment. 

In my opinion the best non-UK places to study is:
1) Netherlands-> tons of great English taught degrees at an amazing level. High percentage of the population knows some English
