PHREAK: What are you, stoned or stupid? You don't hack a bank across state lines from your house, you'll get nailed by the FBI. Where are your brains, in your ass? Don't you know anything?
CEREAL: Stupid, man. It's universally stupid.
JOEY: You guys always think I should know everything, and you never tell me anything. Am I right?
PHREAK: Alright, what are the three most commonly used passwords?
JOEY: Love, secret, and uh, sex. But not in that order, necessarily, right?
CEREAL: Yeah but don't forget God. System operators love to use God. It's that whole male ego thing.
PHREAK: Look, you wanna be elite? You gotta do a righteous hack. None of this accidental shit.
CEREAL: Oh yeah, you want a seriously righteous hack, you score one of those Gibsons man. You know, supercomputers they use to like, do physics, and look for oil and stuff?
PHREAK: Ain't no way, man, security's too tight. The big iron?
DADE: Maybe. But, if I were gonna hack some heavy metal, I'd, uh, work my way back through some low security, and try the back door.
CEREAL: Yeah but oh man, wouldn't you just love to get one of those Gibsons, baby? Ooooh!
