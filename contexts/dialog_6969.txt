LLOYD: Frida's sheets checked out fine. It was just her own blood. From her... you know.
PETER: I told you she was innocent.
LLOYD: Hey, there was a lot of blood.
PETER: She was never a suspect Lloyd. Some animal must have done this.
LLOYD: I checked all the zoos. No missing animals. You think a pitbull?
PETER: Maybe. What about all those hairs they found on his body?
LLOYD: Waiting for DNA tests. He was hairier than Madonna in Penthouse.
PETER: Madonna's in Penthouse?
LLOYD: Back in the '80's. You didn't see the pictures? They were from before she got famous. She was hairy as hell. Her pits, her bush.
PETER: Hairy women are kind of sexy. Women in their natural state.
PETER: What?
LLOYD: And you think I'm sick?
