BLADE: Recognize him?
NYSSA: From the surveillance footage in the bloodbank. He was one of the guard's Nomak attacked.
BLADE: Which means he turned about seventy-two hours ago.
NYSSA: Right. So why is he dying? He doesn't appear to have any broken bones, no entry wounds of any kind -- what's killing him?
BLADE: Time.
BLADE: No hemoglobin left. Their metabolisms are too fast. They burn out. That's why they're having to feed so often. Their systems are self destructing.
NYSSA: If that's true, what about Nomak? He's been alive longer than the others.
BLADE: Nomak's different. He's the carrier. There's something driving him beyond the Thirst. Something we're missing.
