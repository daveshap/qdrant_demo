Anyone else having to remind themselves that anxiety can manifest itself physically, especially during times of stress?
It’s happened to me a million times before, but this is obviously a unique time. I’ve convinced myself before that things were wrong physically, to the point of having tests done all with negative results. After I control my anxiety, the physical symptoms fade. 

Aside from many aches and pains, I’m almost positive I have Costochondritis, which apparently isn’t dangerous and emotional stress can cause it. Of course 🤦🏻‍♀️. Basically my chest hurts in a certain spot. 

Even though I’ve been through similar things before, everything going on is definitely not helping. Although I don’t think I need one, I’m also constantly thinking about how I don’t want to have to go to the doctor and be exposed in that environment. Ugh. How are you guys?
