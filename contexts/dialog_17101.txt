DOLLARHYDE: Ms. McClain, I'm Francis Dollarhyde. I came about the low light level infrared film stock.
REBA: Put your back against the door. Come forward three steps until you feel the tile on your feet and there will be a stool just to your left.
REBA: Can you give me an idea of the conditions...
DOLLARHYDE: Shooting at maybe eight feet. I can't use any lights.
REBA: What's being photographed?
DOLLARHYDE: The activities of nocturnal animals.
REBA: When do you need it?
DOLLARHYDE: In eight days.
REBA: Let me stick this in the black hole.
REBA: The 1000 C Infrared Sensitive Film must be handled in total darkness. I keep the samples straight by touch code. It's still easier to handle than a 1200 series. Think it'll do?
DOLLARHYDE: It'll do fine.
