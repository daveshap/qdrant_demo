Looking for Advisor for a first year CS PhD student
So, I've accepted an offer from a university to do my PhD. I have full financial support for my first year (fall, winter, summer). I'm not too picky in terms of research project, as long as it is still in my general area (systems). But I have several PIs that I'd love to work with.

What is the best way to reach out to my potential advisors? Could I tell them that I am interested to work with them, even before the semester start? 

I'm also not sure whether I can attend the Fall semester on site due to the current pandemic.
