DARREN: How're ya doin', Max.
ORIGINAL CINDY: You mean until you showed up?
DARREN: You're not still pissed?
MAX: Why would I be pissed?
DARREN: It was a complicated situation which could have been misconstrued, causing you to maybe take offense.
ORIGINAL CINDY: 'Cause you went out the back door and nailed her girlfriend? Who would take offense to that?
DARREN: Justine was not an unwilling participant.
DARREN: Do you know why I went after Justine?
ORIGINAL CINDY: She was there...
DARREN: Trying to have a relationship with you, Max, is like standing in a fog bank. You know you're in the middle of something only you have absolutely no idea where you are.
ORIGINAL CINDY: And when the fog lifted, there's Darren with his head under Justine's skirt.
DARREN: Could you give us a moment.
DARREN: I was crazy about you...am crazy about you. But you keep everyone at arm's length like there's some great big dark something going on that-- I don't know... It's just that the more I tried to get close to you, the more you pulled away.
MAX: I'm really glad we're having this conversation. You're right. I was angry at you. But talking about it-- The scales have fallen from my eyes and I see now that it was all my fault. Can you ever forgive me?
DARREN: I see the perimeter defense system is still fully intact... At least I tried.
ORIGINAL CINDY: Craps all over everything and everyone and then wants mommy to forgive him.
MAX: What guys do. 'Nother order.
ORIGINAL CINDY: You're way more philosophical than I could ever be.
MAX: I just don't go in with any expectations.
