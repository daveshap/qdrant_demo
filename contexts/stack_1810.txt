Why is the noun \"brush-off\" hyphenated when the verb \"to brush off\" is not? I'd like to know the reason for the punctuation of the noun \"brush-off\" and the verb \"to brush off\": they have related meanings, but \"brush-off\" is the result of \"to brush off\essentially. But one cannot write \"to brush-off\" as that just looks weird, as it is used for the noun version.So the question, is the hyphen often used like this in English to differentiate a derived noun from a verb?
