CONRAD: Hey there, Nickie.
NICHOLAS: Conrad, what a surprise. Gesundheit.
CONRAD: Happy Birthday, man.
NICHOLAS: Seymour Butts." I never get tired of that one."
CONRAD: That's why it's a classic. Come on, man... how 'bout a hug... ?
CONRAD: They gave me a free jacket at the door.
NICHOLAS: They'll be wanting it back.
CONRAD: Not after I'm done with it. Actually, I've been here. In grad-school I bought crystal-meth from the maitre d'.
NICHOLAS: Which grad-school?
NICHOLAS: You look good.
CONRAD: So do you. And to think I was worried...
NICHOLAS: About me?
CONRAD: How long's it been? Since mom died... four years? How are you?
NICHOLAS: Never better.
CONRAD: Elizabeth?
NICHOLAS: Divorced. Remarried to some pediatrician or gynecologist, or pediatric gynaecologist, in Sausalito.
CONRAD: Too bad, I liked her. So, you're all alone in the House of Pain?
NICHOLAS: I redecorated. What about you?
CONRAD: Nowhere in particular. Don't you keep track of my whereabouts anymore?
NICHOLAS: Connie... what brings you here? Is everything alright?
CONRAD: Yeah.
NICHOLAS: You need anything?
CONRAD: No.
NICHOLAS: Really?
CONRAD: I don't need anything from you. I was laying on a beach somewhere in Spain, naked, and, it hit me -- Nickie's birthday. So, here I am, four layovers, twenty-seven hours flying and one donkey ride later. Not necessarily in that order.
CONRAD: For you.
NICHOLAS: You shouldn't have.
