My crush vs friends
I have a lot of mutual friends... I also have this crush, I had a boyfriend for 1 month in the past and it ended because of problems. So I basically know nothing about love. This new crush is not the best looking, not always well known, and not an ideal bf or crush type. All of my friends just “ship him with me” but then also they are only excited since I’m knows to be dull and not very emotional. I know for certain he’s a nice person, he’s super funny, sweet, and just great overall.  I have most of the day with him and that’s also a big factor. I’m probably really obvious. So back to my friends, on the other hand they don’t really know him. You know how girls and guys have different friend groups (I’m not very popular). He also has this “girl” friend that he can talk with for fun. I’m super jealous not gonna lie. One friend of mine asks “what do you see in him?” Another says “it’s cute and all but are you sure it’s him?”. And lots of them judge me for liking this guy, they say stupid things like “he is crazy”(tbh everyone is crazy) and some even say “His nose is weird or something.” Excuse me what? His nose changes everything? What I would like to say is, “Your not that good yourself. You have lots of pimples and a bit of acne. It’s obvious you wear makeup. Your personality isn’t the best, sometimes your like those bratty popular girls. You try to show off but also nobody notices, You make fun of me everyday.” I know what some might think, this is VERY long and she’s a fake friend. Well I just keeps some people for company or support. Well anyways I just want to know what some people think in this situation or have any advice? Should I stop liking him, am I really in love? Should I stand up to them? What should I do, I really don’t like when he’s made fun of. Especially by my friends.
