Unemployment benefits 2 different states, which state to file?
I have a friend that works as a contractor. For 2019, he worked as a contractor as a teacher in July, Aug, Sept making $9k. The company that he works for is based in NJ . However he travels to places to teach. The job is not steady and he is only called when he has a mandate. With CoVid, it is unlikely that he'll get any in the near term. From Sept-March, he worked temp office job in NYC in which he was paid $20K for the last 3 months of 2019. He lives in NJ. Which state would he apply for unemployment benefits? How would this work? thanks
