BERLIN: Six girls over a period of 18 months, and give or take a head or two, the M.O.'s exactly the same. Dark hair. No hands. All shot with a high velocity twen- ty-two in the back of the head.
ROSS: How come the F.B.I. don't put anya this together? They work- ed over Jennifer" for months?"
BERLIN: They possibly did - but they nev- er had a head, so they never had a bullet - and they never got an I.D. - not on any of em - never bust a homicide unless you know who your victim is - we're the first to get a positive identity.
ROSS: Identity of whom? You got a girl, doesn't even have a driver's lic- ense? .. She's untraceable, John .. You need fifty detectives on this.
BERLIN: That's what I'm here for. I want you to come and see Citrine with me? He's not gonna here it from me but I know he'd listen to you.
ROSS: Listen to me saying what?
BERLIN: I wanna take that fucking Blind In- stitute to pieces .. Every address book, every phone call, everyone in and outta there in the last 5 years ..
ROSS: For a <u>dead</u> <u>dog</u>?
BERLIN: We've fused into a major series, Ross. This girl isn't the second victim. This is Jennifer <u>Eight</u>.""
ROSS: That isn't what you said before.
BERLIN: I was wrong.
