oh no i have a crush
ok so i have a problem..

my friend asked me who i thought was the hottest at a guys lunch  table and i had said my now crush because he was the most attractive guy out of there table then i started having a crush on him big more of a not admitting to myself that i had a crush on him but then my friend had told my friend i called him hot and she asked what he thought of me he ( my friend’s words) got nervous and walked away. but he never talks to me and doesn’t do the light thing people do when they do like look at you for a second or try and talk to you...i feel like he got uncomfortable about what i had said. this is been on my mind all the time i have no idea what to do
