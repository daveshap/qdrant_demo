Iâ€™ve been asking guys out on dates.
And itâ€™s glorious!! I highly recommend. There was this one guy I knew was interested in me in college/asked me out at one point but I denied him because I wasnâ€™t interested and had a long term boyfriend. I recently saw him at a party. We spent hours catching up and I messaged him the day after and asked if he wanted to grab a drink. When we went on the date he was telling me how he had already planned on asking me out but I beat him to it!! He said he was shocked because a girl had never asked him out before! 

Anyways.. ladies. Donâ€™t hold back. The biggest catastrophe is being turned down. Shoot ya shot.. it could really be worth it!!

I have my second date with him tomorrow. I tried dating a few different people but thereâ€™s been zero connection. Iâ€™m anxious and excited about this all! ðŸ˜¬
