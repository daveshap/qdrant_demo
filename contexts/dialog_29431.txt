ROBERT: He died in a liposuction surgery, right?
SPECIAL-AGENT-IN-CHARGE: Right. Now it's used by somebody from the Juarez Cartel, one of his lieutenants... Who knows? Every damn day there's birthday party. At first I thought they must have three hundred children, then I realized they're taunting us. Three miles away and we can't touch them. Ha, ha, ha.
ROBERT: Who do we interface with on their side?
SPECIAL-AGENT-IN-CHARGE: What do you mean?
ROBERT: I mean, who runs interdiction on the Mexico side?
SPECIAL-AGENT-IN-CHARGE: I don't know. I don't think there's any one person. See the problem is the Juarez cartel owns everything and everybody, all the property on the Mexican side, sometimes all the property on both sides. Warehouses, transportation, even tunnels. It's very organized.
