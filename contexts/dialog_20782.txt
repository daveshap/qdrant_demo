JOE: Is there some kind of expression I've picked up from Beckett?! Some kind of fairy attitude I've unconsciously adopted?! Am I walking different?! Some kind of vocal thing?! Have I picked up some kind of homo <u>vibe</u>?!
LISA: Have you changed your aftershave?
JOE: Very funny. I had a box of Pampers under my arm for Chrissake!
