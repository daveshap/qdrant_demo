LUCIANO: If I wanted ta kill ya, I woulda done it long ago. It's not like you ain't given me reason.
MASSERIA: I'm still the Boss of All the Bosses! And you'll do what I say!
LUCIANO: So tell me when I ain't done it.
MASSERIA: How can I trust you when you look at me like that?
LUCIANO: You got no fuckin' choice. You might be able to stay alive, but you're never gonna win the war from these fuckin' rat holes.
MASSERIA: Tell me, Charlie. Please.
LUCIANO: Why should I go against you, Boss? Nobody can handle this business like you. Maranzano'll never know the crap that you forget. He's got no business bein' Boss. The idea makes me wanna puke. You're the Boss, an it's gonna stay that way.
