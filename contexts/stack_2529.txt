Euclidean distance and connecting lines between polygons using ArcMap? I have a large set of polygons. I want to (1) calculate pairwise distances between polygons (so one polygon should be connected to several others). I can do this using the generate table in ArcMap. and then (2) I want a lines connecting these polygons (again one to many/many to one) that can link to the  distance file. The only way I can think of doing this is through linkage mapper, but I dont want all the least-cost etc analysis, which is very time consuming. Is there a simpler way to do this using ArcMap 10.5?
