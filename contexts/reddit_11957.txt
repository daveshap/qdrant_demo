Don't know if my friends like me
There's actually a lot of stuff bothering me, but what's got me down right now is my friends. I'm a guy in Grade 11, and I've got a few good friends and several other kind of acquaintances. The thing is, over the summer, I haven't really spoken to any of my good friends. We usually play games every other night or so on Steam, but this summer was way different. To start off, I was away for two weeks at the beginning. When I got back, none of my friends were around. I'd text, message on Facebook, or try to talk to them on Steam, but nothing worked. I didn't want to alienate them by being annoying, so I stopped trying. The summer went on, and we didn't talk once. I didn't even get the chance, as they wouldn't be online when I was and still hadn't responded to anything I'd said earlier in the summer. Now, with two weeks left, I don't know what to do. I've considered talking to them, but I'm wondering if my persistence in trying to talk to them was what drove them away. I just really don't know what to do. Any advice would be much appreciated.
