MR. JOHNNY: I'll call you when I get to Mama's house.
LORETTA: You've made me very happy, Johnny.
MR. JOHNNY: There's one thing about this wedding I want you to do. Call this number. It's a business number. Ask for Ronny. Invite him to the wedding.
LORETTA: Who is he?
MR. JOHNNY: He's my younger brother.
LORETTA: You have a brother?
MR. JOHNNY: We haven't spoken in five years. There was some bad blood. I want you to call him and invite him to the wedding. Will you do it?
LORETTA: Sure.
