SVM vs decision trees in small datasets with batch effects I trained a SVM and a random forest on a biological small data set (binary classification), yielding a solid training performance (ROC of around 0.85 for the 10 times 10-fold CV training). After that I tried to predict an independent test set, which for sure has some batch effects in it. The SVM model worked out quite good for the classification while RF basically failed. I think that SVM did a better job in generalization while RF maybe especially over-learned the characteristics of the batch effects.I would be interested if there is some (scientific) literature available concerning the robustness of SVM when it comes to the robustness towards batch effects / noise, maybe in comparison to RF. This would help me a lot understanding this phenomenom.Thanks in advance.
