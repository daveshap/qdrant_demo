Is it OK to Stop Working Hard?
Context: Worked for large company for a few years. Annual reviews one person in department gets big raise, and extra 2.5-5% on top of annual. 

Last year I busted my ass, working 80 hour weeks, 7 days, coming back at night to cover emergencies.

Other departments come to me when they need something done. I am a doer and was just doing my best to support the product at launch. 

Review time, no big bonus. I didn't talk to boss because it is already done and won't be changed, and I won't be satisfied with the answer. 

Instead I went full office space and began doing my basic requirements. 8 hours, 5 days. Other departments come for help, and I tell them to ask (Specific responsible person). 

I feel bad because I can do more, but I don't see the purpose of doing more. I can do the minimum and make the same salary, and be home with the family more. 

In the meantime I am looking for other opportunities, but for now I feel like a slacker for only doing my job.
