SELENA: Why did she have to show up now?
BIANCA: Eliminate her.
SELENA: That's easy for you to say, Bianca.
BIANCA: You can do it. You're the most powerful woman on Earth.
SELENA: Am I? Still?
BIANCA: Yes! You own the Coffer of Shadow. Nothing can withstand its power.
SELENA: I've been saving it. For the right moment.
BIANCA: That moment is now! What good is a sword unless it be unsheathed? Use it, and no one will dare oppose you again. No one.
