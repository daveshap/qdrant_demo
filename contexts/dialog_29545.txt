EARL: Uh...Digging that waterhole for Nestor.
VAL: Burt and Heather's place is closer. Let's do their kitchen today. Do Nestor tomorrow.
EARL: Nestor's out of town tomorrow. We don't dig today. We don't get paid today. Damn it, Valentine, you never plan ahead. You never take the long view. Hell, here it is Monday and I'm already working on Wednesday. It is Monday, right?
VAL: Who the hell's that? That's not what's his name...the grad student?
EARL: Nah, it's September. Must be the new one.
VAL: The new one! That's supposed to be a girl!
RHONDA: Hi, I'm Rhonda. Rhonda LeBeck. I'm up here for the semester...
VAL: Yeah, geography.
RHONDA: Right, geology. And you have to be Val and Earl. I've heard all about you.
