How is it possible to even get a girlfriend?
I just don't get it really, online dating is obviously useless in that regard, but even in really life, lets say I start talking a girl. Even if it goes well and I got her number, the next day she has more than likely forgotten about the interaction and I don't why a girl would have enough reason to meet up somewhere again because of a 10 minute conversation she had with a stranger. Like why would a girl meet up with someone again because of some small talk; does that even happen? 

The only other circumstance I can figure working out is if you see a girl often enough and talk enough that you can maybe get a chance, but once you are not in college, apart from maybe the workplace, I don't think too many situations like that exist.

I dunno, I just don't see how it is achievable to set up, and impress a girl enough to even go on a date. How does this work?
