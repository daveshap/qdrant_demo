STACY: Another summer of working at Swenson's.
LINDA: Come on. There's lots of men around here. Keep your eyes open.
STACY: You know, Linda. I've finally figured it out. It's not sex I want. Anyone can have sex.
LINDA: What do you want?
STACY: I want romance.
LINDA: Romance in Ridgemont? We don't even get cable TV.
STACY: Mike! You have a mess on C-9!
DAMONE: All right. All right. I just cleaned B-8. Give me a break.
STACY: Get going.
