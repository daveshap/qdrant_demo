JACK: They're from both of us.
PHYLLIS: A famous actor bringing me flowers on my birthday. Don't I feel special?
MILES: A famous actor who's getting married next week.
PHYLLIS: Oh, that's right. Isn't that nice? I hope that girls knows how lucky she is, marrying no less than Derek Summersby.
JACK: Jeez, Mrs. Raymond, that was eleven years ago.
PHYLLIS: Well, you were wonderful on that show. I never understood why they had to give you that brain tumor so soon. Why that didn't make you the biggest movie star in the world is a sin. It's a sin.
JACK: Yeah, well, you should be my agent.
PHYLLIS: If I was, I would sing your praises up and down the street until they put me in the loony bin. Now Miles, why didn't you tell me you were coming and bringing this handsome man? Look how I'm dressed. I've got to run and put my face on.
JACK: You look fabulous, Mrs. Raymond.
PHYLLIS: Oh, stop it. Make yourselves comfortable. You boys hungry?
