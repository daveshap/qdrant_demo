Just remember : in finance subs there are always people who would have you wear grain sacks as clothing while you subsist on earth worms you dug up to save a few bucks a year.
Obviously we're fairly poor or we wouldn't be here. But some people are capable of extremes that go beyond common sense and not everyone is able to. Found you spend $100 on Starbucks every month? Need a cheaper alternative? Brewing your own coffee and buying certain creamers for less than $10-20 a month is a great alternative! You can listen to whomever suggested that. But it IS okay to ignore the guy suggesting you boil dirt or dumpster dive behind Dunkin Donuts for used grains.
