TROXELL: Marsh's Cardiologist told me that after Marsh was diagnosed with heart disease he quit smoking, quit drinking and started exercising every day. Does that sound like a guy who'd start shoveling cocaine up his nose?
CARDENAS: What did he say about Miss Lawson?
TROXELL: He can remember at least one occasion -- and the receptionist can recall two times when she accompanied Marsh to the office.
CARDENAS: So she knew about his heart?
TROXELL: Had to. I also interviewed three women who were in past relationships with Marsh. There's no evidence that he had anything but straight sex prior to meeting Miss Lawson.
CARDENAS: What about the will?
TROXELL: That's the best part. She gets it all -- everything.
