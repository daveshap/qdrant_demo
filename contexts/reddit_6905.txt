Got notice that our team is getting laid off... My first time.. Need a little guidance.
Found out our whole team is getting laid off starting Nov. Sales did not go as planned and they have to make the tough decisions. No hard feelings here. I get it. I am not in the "Sales" part of the team and was told I will be staying a little longer. I have a meeting sometime today to speak about my severance. 

The President of the company pulled me aside (away from HR) and told me "You're good, not going anywhere"... Should I take his word for it? 

I am so confused. Also very certain this may have happened to someone else and was probably lied to. Should I play my cards and ask for more severance than they are offering? Ultimately, I will eventually get let go. It is just a matter of when.
