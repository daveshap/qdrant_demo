Thank you
I dont know if this post breaks the rules, but Ill try my luck with it. I just want to say thank you to every wonderful human being who adds to this subreddit. As someone who has struggled with suicidal thoughts forever, finding this community has been amazing. 

One of the worst feelings ive ever had was being completely and utterly alone. I cant even imagine how much easier my struggles would have been with awesome, compassionate, empathetic people like you. Please know that you help so much. Thank you.
