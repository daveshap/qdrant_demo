Gnome Shell doesn't recognize Wine windows Since Ubuntu 18.04 I'm more or less forced to use Gnome Shell (also given the discontinuation of Unity...)<br>Wine apps used to run fine in Unity 7 (7.5.0). They still run fine in Gnome Shell (3.28.3) except they are not recognized as windows. Which means: I can click and interact with everything inside the app (including menus) but not the window itself (I can't drag the title bar, can't user Super+Click or Super+ArrowKey to move the window). The Gnome Shell title bar never recognizes the launched wine app and will show nothing in the place where the application title should be. I also can't use Alt+Tab -  the Wine app always stays on top (and can be clicked inside) while the active window (as shown in the Gnome Shell title bar) changes. I assume this isn't a bug since I can't imagine that Wine is broken/unusable for all Gnome Shell users, so: what am I doing wrong?
