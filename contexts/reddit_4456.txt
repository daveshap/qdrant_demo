Can’t escape politics and it’s making me not want to exist
I’m so sick of hearing about politics. Liberals and conservatives are constantly in these arrogant screaming matches over who is right, and it’s so pathetic that it’s drawing all the energy out of me.

We’re destroying the earth and still have to argue whether or not this is a real issue.

I’m trying to fight inside myself just to get through the day and go to work and be there for my family but underneath it all I have this deep seething depression that nothing I do matters and that humans are just slowly fostering more and more hate.

I can’t handle it, and I feel powerless and I just don’t know how to get through this.

Edit: wow, thank you all so much for these replies. You all helped so much and I’m bookmarking this page to come back and read it when I start to feel down again. These replies inspired me to delete my Facebook and twitter accounts, as they were only causing me anxiety. My dead end job often increases my depression but I’m going to look into volunteering to find something proactive to do in my city. Thank you for reading my plea for help and for caring enough to respond. You all truly helped me and these replies will stay with me... I know my depression and darkness will come back, but I feel more equipped for coping.

I feel heard, and I thank you.
