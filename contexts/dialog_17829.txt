RATSO: Hey, what the hell you doing?
JOE: I'm zipping your fly, what the hell you think I'm doing?
RATSO: Thanks, Joe.
JOE: Shee-it, you know, I got this thing all figured out, Ratso. I mean Rico. When we get to Miami, what I'll do, I'll go to work. I gotta do that, 'cause see, I ain't no kind of a hustler. I ain't even any goddam good as a bum. I'm a nothing, that's what I am. So reckon I'd better go to work and get me a goddam job. Okay?
