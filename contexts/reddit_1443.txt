Just had a panick attack while donating blood, everyone was looking at me I'm so embarassed
I wanted to do this thing and be proud of it even tho I'm scared of needles. Right when I was done I started shaking and hyperventilating and the nurses thought my pressure had dropped or something so they were all around me and I was too embarrassed to say it was anxiety. This only made it worse of course and I started crying and ugh, I proud I did it but I'm super embarrassed haha

Edit: Omg you guys, thank you so much for all the kind words! I'm blown away. Thank you.
