A tv series with a meteorite Recently, someone told me about a series where a meteorite hits the earth. When a team goes to investigate it, they find out that the plants around the impact have mutated. After a while the team itself starts to undergo the effects. It really sounded like a good series but he couldn't remember the name, anyone that can help me?
