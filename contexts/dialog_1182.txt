CONSTANZE: You're not going to do this?
MOZART: Why not? Half the house!
CONSTANZE: When? We need money now. Either he pays now, or you don't do it.
MOZART: Oh, Stanzi.
CONSTANZE: I don't trust this man. And I didn't like what he did with your opera. It was common.
MOZART: Well, you liked it, didn't you? Monkey-flunki-punki.
CONSTANZE: Half the house! You'll never see a penny. I want it here, in my hand.
MOZART: Stanzi-manzi, I'll put it in your hand!
CONSTANZE: Shut up! I'll not let you put anything in my hand until I see some money.
SCHLUMBERG: Herr Mozart. What a surprise. What can I do for you?
MOZART: Is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music?
SCHLUMBERG: Well, your pupil is married and living in Mannheim, young man.
MOZART: Really? Perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction?
SCHLUMBERG: What is this, Mozart? What's the matter with you?
MOZART: Well. Since it appears nobody is eager to hire my services, could you favour me with a little money instead?
SCHLUMBERG: What for?
MOZART: If a man cannot earn, he must borrow.
SCHLUMBERG: Well, this is hardly the way to go about it.
MOZART: No doubt, sir. But I am endowed with talent, and you with money. If I offer mine, you should offer yours.
SCHLUMBERG: I'm sorry. No.
MOZART: Please. I'll give it back, I promise. Please, sir.
SCHLUMBERG: My answer is no, Mozart.
