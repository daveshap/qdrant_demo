Ferrofluid between glass plates: what\u2019s going on? There\u2019s a phenomenon I ran across recently and I\u2019m trying to understand what\u2019s going on with it. When you have a thin layer of ferrofluid between two glass plates and move a magnet closer and farther away from it, you get a really interesting transition between two states. When the magnet\u2019s at a distance, the fluid breaks up into large droplets like this:\u2026but when the magnet\u2019s closer, the droplets merge together into thin tendrils, a lot like the kind you get out of a reaction-diffusion process.My question is: what forces are at play here? I assume the blobs/tendrils are held together by surface tension, but they seem to be repelling each other\u2014are they acting as individual magnets? If so, what causes them to stay together at all instead of the intra-blob repulsion breaking them up?
