Would equipment that is wrongly used by a person be considered as a systematic error? Would equipment that is wrongly used by a person be considered as a systematic error or a random or both? I would say a systematic error because a person could don't know how to use a ruler and starts his measurement at points that are not zero. And as a result, he will get wrong consistent data. But i am not sure so please help. Thank you.
