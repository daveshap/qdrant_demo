My friend (16m) told me he tried
I am a 17 yeard old male. My friends is a 16 year old male. He said he started taking adderal.  Which is speed. For adhd people it calms the down and if you dont have adhd it speeds you up.  He said that hes been taking adderal to get his school work and chores caught up.  How do i tell him im concerned?  Im not entirely sure how to handle this situation because ive never actually had to deal with drugs.
