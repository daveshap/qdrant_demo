BEN: Hey, Brad... how's it going?
BRAD: Hey Ben. There were a couple of guys looking for you.
BEN: What did they look like?
BRAD: Suits. I didn't tell them anything. You know anything about gears?
BEN: How'd this happen?
BRAD: I was going real fast down on the beach and something slipped and everything got jammed up.
BEN: The news is not good, kid. This bit here... see there... it's broken. You need a new one.
BRAD: How much, do you think?
BEN: I don't know. I'll find out though.
