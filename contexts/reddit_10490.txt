I Can Always Just Die After Graduation
I don't think I want to continue living in this world after I graduate college. I still have over a year left, but I worry about my future every single day. I don't think I'm cut out to live in this highly competitive world. I struggle enough already as a student and have no passions or ideas about what I want to do. I want to exist, but not the way the majority of people in this society have to exist. So, my thoughts go to suicide quite a bit these days. I think to myself, "I can always just die" and then I won't have to deal with any of it anymore. I don't want to work my life away. I'd rather just be dead and move on to whatever comes next. I'm just so scared.
