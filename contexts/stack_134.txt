What color wallpaper makes page control dots on iPhone invisible? What color wallpaper do I need to use to make the page control dots invisible?I know, you can't really hide them, as in remove from the screen (without iOS jailbreaking) but you can make them almost invisible if you select the right color of the wallpaper.I have tried using two different wallpapers, while one makes them almost invisible the other does not, but the dots are over the same color on both wallpapers.
