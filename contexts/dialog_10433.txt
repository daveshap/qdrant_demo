WASHINGTON: General Greene?
NATHANAEL GREENE: I'm with Captain Hamilton.
WASHINGTON: Yes, I thought that's how you'd feel, Nathanael.
HAMILTON: Excuse me, General, but may I ask how do you feel?
WASHINGTON: No one wants to turn the table on the enemy more than I. But if victory is remote and there's any hope for a negotiated peace, we must keep this army intact.
HAMILTON: Therefore, retreat.
WASHINGTON: I'm so inclined.
HAMILTON: Well, sir, then is it possible you called us all here just to hear what you wanted to hear.
