First suicidal thought in a while
I have got severe depression and severe anxiety, but thanks to counseling for the past few days I have been feeling almost normal. However today I had an anxiety attack over nothing and it just triggered everything off again. I got home from work and got a bottle of vodka and all the co-codimol I could find and just started writing a note. 
I realised what I was doing when I finished writing my note and now I feel worse than I did before.
It seems to be that no matter how far I get I always end up worse than before and its just starting to get too much. I don't want to end it, because then I'll be even more of a disappointment to my family, but I just want to find peace.
I'm spending the night with my brother but I still feel so alone. And that's what's bothering me :/
