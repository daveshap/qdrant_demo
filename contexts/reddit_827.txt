I’m an italian OCD and anxiety sufferer, and I’m here to tell you that it’s going to be okay.
I know you probably don’t believe me, but it WILL get better and easier. I know it sounds scary when governments start to put out all of those limitations and lockdowns, but it’s for the better. 

If you’re starting quarantine or are obligated to stay home just like we are, I promise you’ll get used to it. And not used to it in a negative way! There are so many things you can do at home: I baked so many cakes, I’m trying to do the splits, I’m reading all the books I never got a chance to read. Isolation is reaaally not that bad.

We have the amazing power of adaptation. Every tool you have learned to cope with your anxiety will come in super handy, and you’ll see how strong you are with them. Sometimes I imagine COVID-19 as the boss level of anxiety, and it gets me super pumped lol. It makes me want to kick its ass so much.

It’s a wild ride but if us italians are riding it out, you’ll ride it out as well!
Sending you all a giant hug. We’re in this shit together.

And please, remember this pro tip: check what is necessary to check on the news. And that means check only what YOU as a citizen need to do. Numbers will go super high, then super low, then high and low again... it’s a pain that you really don’t need in your everyday life. If it’s impossible for you to resist the urge, have a trusted loved one tell you the necessary things you need to know: if there are new limitations, if you can go to school / work , what you should do with your hands etc.

EDIT: thank you so much for the awards, I really never thought this would blow up. There are so many comments, I’ll try my best to answer to the most. But as for all the compliments, THANK YOU!! You are all really sweet. You’ve joined the fight with us, you are not alone :).
