What are the pros and cons of the US withdrawing from the Open Skies treaty?
What is the Open Skies Treaty? The treaty allows 34 countries to conduct unarmed surveillance flights over one another's territories -- including the US and Russia. It was signed in 1992 and went into effect in 2002.


Why is it in the news now? Officials are reporting that Trump is intending to withdraw from the 34 nation treaty.


Why is it a big deal? Trump's critics claim that the treaty allows us to monitor Russian military movements, and a withdrawal from the treaty would only benefit Russia.


The White House has so far not confirmed the expected withdrawal or reasons for it. However, a State Department spokesman's comment did hint at dissatisfaction with the treaty. "We continue to implement the treaty and are in full compliance with our obligations under this Treaty, unlike Russia," the spokesperson said.


What are the objective benefits of withdrawal vs the negative implications of withdrawal?
