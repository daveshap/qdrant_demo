GEORGE: We're fine. Turkey sandwiches.
ROBIN: Well, for later then.
ROBIN: It makes me sad.
GEORGE: What?
ROBIN: I used to live here.
GEORGE: But you hated four out of the five you did.
ROBIN: I was here six years. And I only hated two.
GEORGE: Which?
ROBIN: The first and the last.
GEORGE: I don't even like turkey sandwiches. What kind of pizza?
ROBIN: Sam's favorite.
