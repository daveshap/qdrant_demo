How would you feel if you were out on a first date and she said she didnâ€™t think you were compatible but that you would probably be great for her friend?
Would you be okay with it and willing to see the friend or be weirded out or insulted, or none of the above? Assume the friend is equally hot based on pictures she shows you.
