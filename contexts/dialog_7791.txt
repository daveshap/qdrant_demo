JESSICA: HARRY!
HARRY: MS. HELLER said not to talk to you.
JESSICA: That's because Ms. Heller doesn't want you to know this whole thing is a scam.
HARRY: A-ha! I had a feeling it was all a fake.
JESSICA: You did?
HARRY: Yeah. Look at this polar bear. It hasn't moved in half an hour. And those Eskimos over there...I'm sure at least one of them is a mannequin.
JESSICA: Oh Harry, you're so funny. Now I have something that's kind of delicate...
HARRY: Oh, you want to talk about your delicates?
JESSICA: Are you trying to be funny? Or are you actually re--, re...special
HARRY: We're all special. Everyone Lloyd and I chose for the class is special.
JESSICA: You and Lloyd chose the class!?
HARRY: Excuse me?
JESSICA: Come over around seven.
HARRY: O'clock?
JESSICA: Yeah...
HARRY: Gotcha.
LLOYD: Sorry about that Harry, first time I've brought a friend up there. You okay?
HARRY: Yea!
LLOYD: Who cares? Chicks are for fags.
HARRY: I think she wants me to come over to put me into the right position to check out her delicates, what ever that means.
LLOYD: Oh yeah, buddy, you're gonna get some"."
HARRY: Some what?
LLOYD: You know... She's gonna be all over you like a barrel of monkeys, with her tight shirt and short skirt... Eeeww, it's so faggy I can't even talk about it.
HARRY: Come on, Lloyd. You must know someone I can talk to.
LLOYD: Sure I do. On one condition.
HARRY: You can't marry my mom.
LLOYD: It's really not up to you, Harry. But we just want you to feel like you're part of the decision.
HARRY: Shut up!
LLOYD: Alright, if you really want to go down this road, well girl's like chocolate.
