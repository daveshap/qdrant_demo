GENE: What...?
MR. SMITH: Tell me why I miss him.
GENE: He's dead?
MR. SMITH: That's right. He's dead. Tell me why.
GENE: How should I...?
MR. SMITH: Tell me why he's dead.
GENE: You killed him.
MR. SMITH: That's right, I killed him. He fucked up one too many times so I put a bullet in his eye. Then I put two more into him just to make sure. Now that was somebody I loved.
