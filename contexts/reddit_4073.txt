For the love of God, ladies, please stop using awful filters on dating profiles that completely change what you look like
So I recently started online dating and like 75% of the women's profiles are oversaturated, airbrushed to hell and back to the point you look like an alien. 

Also, I come across a lot of profiles that have multiple women in all the pictures on the profiles and they don't even say which one is them. Like, what's the point of having 3 or 4 or more people in every photo and not even point out to which one is you?

It's only been a few weeks since I started and the only people to have responded to my messages or sent me one of their own free will are sex workers and bots.

Multiple profiles with the same exact pictures and scammers galore. How is online dating even remotely successful?
