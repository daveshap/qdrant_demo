BECKER: I'll say a prayer for you in Church today, Starks. Maybe the Gods can pick up where the medicine left off.
STARKS: You sure you know where to find one?
BECKER: I've managed to every Sunday of my life. [Beat] Some of us are God- fearing men, Starks.
STARKS: And what does that mean?
BECKER: Means we believe in doing his work and fear what the world would be like if we didn't at least try to.
STARKS: Becker, how do you sleep at night?
BECKER: You in here. [Beat] Works like a drug.
