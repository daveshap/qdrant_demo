I can finally say that I’m a College Graduate
last year i posted a story of my dreadful life in studying music in a university. it was a tough year and i was really happy and most thankful that you guys were very supportive and helpful in the comments. i followed every advice on taking everything slowly. practicing piano 1-2 hours a day upto 4 hours a day. 

everything went great when 2020 came. passed my auditions and scheduled my recital last March 14, 2020. i was the last one to perform but everything went wrong because of the pandemic. my school closed down by March 13. i wasn’t given a chance to just perform by March 14. and our graduation supposed to be on last March 21. they didn’t allow me and my family were very disappointed. all our plans were wasted.

i came home to our hometown with a broken heart. i kept my chill so i can prevent severe episodes during the lockdown. i have small cries in the bathroom and anxiety attacks during late night hours. i did my best to breathe.

our college of music dean told me to have an alternative. i’ll send raw footage of me playing my piano pieces. once i send those videos, the dean will certify that i’m a graduate of the university. (because the recital is my final requirement for me to be able to graduate). of course, it took a while because i recorded a lot so i can send the best videos.

and just tonight i sent them all and felt very nervous because it’s already late.

it was checked and got critiqued. and then the dean said, “Congratulations”. and then, that was that. it’s done. and at last, after 7 years...i can finally say that i’m a College Graduate. i cried so hard my family laughed at me for my ugly tears of joy. they were very glad and made ‘em proud.

i would like to thank everyone in this sub. i may not know you, you may not know me and you may forgot that story i posted but this reddit sub helped me cope up. i helped people here too even though i myself was feeling miserable. i read some comments to some posts and learned a lot.

THANK YOU SO MUCH.
