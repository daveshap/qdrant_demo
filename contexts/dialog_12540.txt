BUBBER: That's for Ga... Ms. Gayley.
BERNIE: What am I, a goddamn postman? I'm way the fuck up here, I'm scared a heights, and you want me to deliver a letter? Put a stamp on it for Chrissake!
BUBBER: That's close enough. It's a confession. The truth. Jesus, I'm sorry, LaPlante. I had the shoe, you said you didn't want, publicity because of your legal problems.
BERNIE: I don't recall saying I didn't want a million bucks...
BUBBER: I never really thought they'd go for it. And then... you didn't come forward, they investigated my war record... I kept expecting you to show up and expose me...
BERNIE: I was in the can, for Chrissake.
BUBBER: The bathroom! For two days?
BERNIE: Jail! Listen, Bubber... This is crazy. We could fall off of here.
BUBBER: You should go in. You're risking your life again...
BERNIE: I'm beginning to... be aware of that, John. Listen, I'm not gonna do nothing heroic here, you can trust me on that, buddy. Whaddaya say we just sit down for a while. I don't have no tricks, I'm not that smart. You could, like, rest up for the jump.
BUBBER: What have I done? I was dirt poor and useless... but I was honest.
BERNIE: Lighten up, John. You think <u>you</u> got problems for Chrissake?
