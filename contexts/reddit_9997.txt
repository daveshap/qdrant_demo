Question regarding graduation and not meeting requirements for secondary degree.
Hi all, I am going to be graduating soon from a engineering program at a university with my bachelors. I am also enrolled in the arts and sciences program almost finished with requirements for an economics degree. However I was not aware that I would also have to complete general arts and science requirements on top of my general engineering requirements. My question is, can I proceed to graduate with my engineering degree then come back in two or three years to complete my remaining arts and sciences requirements? I do not have the finances to prolong my undergraduate career and need to at least have my engineering degree.
