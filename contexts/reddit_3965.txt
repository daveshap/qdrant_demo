I (25m) seem to only attract girls with anxiety/depression and it kind of weirds me out.
I've been in a few relationships before (all lasting a few months, all fun, and all ended by circumstances outside my control). They've all been great, I've learned a lot about dating and about myself, but (and I know this is shallow)- every girl I've dated has a history of anxiety and/or depression that began before I met them, and which I've found out about AFTER we start dating.

I know that I'm a confident, empathetic person who gives a lot in relationships and is comfortable with vulnerability, but it seems like the only people who are attracted to me are women looking for that emotional stability, who then latch onto me right away. I don't regret any of my past relationships, and I enjoy being an emotional rock. However, I feel guilty when I share my own problems or concerns with my dating partners because I feel like its unfair to make them listen to/help me with my problems when they have so much else they're worried about. I've genuinely cared about and trusted the women I've dated, but I sometimes find myself holding back, if that makes sense. Now I'm a PhD student and I have an insanely busy schedule, so I can't give as much as I'm used to, which makes me worried about dating someone with anxiety.

Have you noticed differences when you were dating people with and without anxiety? What were those differences? Were those relationships equally satisfying- am I missing out on something in my relationships? I guess I just need advice on how to handle this moving forward. Do I need to change how I portray myself online/in real life?
