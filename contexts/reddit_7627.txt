Landed a prestigious award out of the blue, no idea what to do.
I'm going into the second year of my PhD, and applied for a fellowship at the urging of a couple of my committee members. Things were pretty rough over the past year, I was the only grad student under my advisor, there was no summer funding for me which was an unpleasant surprise, I have a huge case of imposter syndrome (went from bachelors straight into PhD), I even doubted choosing my program, etc.

I submitted the proposal thinking that at best this was good practice for the NSF GFRP application, and it would make writing future grants easier.

I just found out this morning that **I won the fellowship, and I am set for the rest of my PhD.** Tuition, a 110% stipend pay raise, travel money, summer funding, government partnership, everything. I can't go into more detail because the official announcement hasn't been made.

I'm still in shock. I can't believe it still. I'm not sure what to do with this kind of validation honestly, as I've felt like I've just been fumbling around for 12 months.

I wanted to share because I never felt like I deserved this kind of award, but for others who feel useless or lost, or that it's not worth applying for whatever you don't think you're worthy of, *"'You miss 100 percent of the shots you don't take'- Wayne Gretzky"-Michael Scott**
