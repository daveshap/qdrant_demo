CLERK: Certainly, Mr. Duke!
DUKE: My bags are out there in that white Cadillac convertible. Can you have someone drive it around to the room?
DUKE: Oh, and could I get a quart of Wild Turkey, two fifths of Baccardi, and a night's worth of ice delivered to my room, please?
CLERK: Don't worry about a thing, sir. Just enjoy your stay.
DUKE: Well, thank you.
