Name of the 90's show/episode with a companion/sex robot (blonde, maybe Jenna McCarthy) A companion robot and an astronaut are returning home, and the companion robot is annoyed because the astronaut won't have sex with her. They are in a ship, and the astronaut keeps talking about his wife. This was probably mid to late 90's. I just remember having to turn it off because my parents came home. I think she was blonde, and in a tight dress in the beginning, and the guy was in his uniform. It was very, \"outer limits\" like, in that it wasn't an on going show, but an episode from a sci-fi series.
