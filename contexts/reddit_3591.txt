Five Signs That You’re Unapproachable
Here’s the simple truth. If you’re not projecting an air of approachability, you’re going to fail with women. Unfortunately, most women view a majority of men as being absolutely unapproachable. Read on and I’ll tell you the five biggest reasons why!  


 **1. Not smiling** :  

If you see a woman scowling, does it make you want to approach her? Probably not, as you already get the idea that she’s in a bad mood. 

**2. Avoiding eye contact :**  

Eye contact is the universal signal that you’re into someone. So if we’re looking over in your direction but you never lock eyes with us, then it’s much less likely we’ll approach you. 

**3. Closed body language:** 

The more closed off your body language, the more unapproachable you seem. It might be crossing your arms or legs. Or keeping your hands in your pockets.

**4. Not having fun:** 

This one is mainly relevant if you’re in a social environment e.g. a bar or a party. We’ll naturally gravitate to the men who are clearly having the most fun. Why?

**5. Looking busy:**

We’re socially conditioned to not want to interrupt people who are busy. But most of us these days are doing things to keep from being bored — which also makes us look unapproachable.  


Thanks.
