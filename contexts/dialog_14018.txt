KARLA: I thought you were out of town!
JULIE: What are you doing in my closet?
KARLA: I thought you were out of town!
JULIE: What are you doing in my closet?
KARLA: i just wanted your black pants, but I'm not ready to die for them!
JULIE: That was heart attack time, Karla.
KARLA: No. When I put these skinny pants on my body...Now, that's heart attack time.
JULIE: I'm not going anywhere. I'm fat, ugly, and depressed.
KARLA: Yeah, right -- whatever.
JULIE: I think I just really hurt Ray's feelings.
KARLA: Listen to me, Julie. Ray's a great guy, nothing against old Ray, but he's so...Ray. I mean, he lives in Southport. Will's a nice guy, too, and he lives right down the street.
JULIE: There's nothing between Will and me.
KARLA: Yet. Nothing yet.
