Starting to feel I will be fired soon
Hey everyone,

Recently I spoke up about a certain topic and this week my workload has been given to others.  Trying to mentally prepare on what to do next and prepare my finances.  I have seen others eventually be told to not come to work because there is nothing for them to do.  The thing is I am a full time employee and I don’t want to quit until I have secured another full time job.

Has anyone else experienced this? How did you deal? What if I can’t find a full time job quick enough.
