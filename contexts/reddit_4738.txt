I feel so lost, I don't know how much more I have left in me
I'm a 50 year old male with a 10 year old daughter (shared custody with the ex).  I spent most of my life as a high functioning person and was always in the top 10% of the population income wise.  I've had issues (depression, eating disorders) since I was a kid but I was always able to "handle" it and stay high functioning.  Then, over 6 months, I lost my job after 25 years and with the end of my paycheque, so ended my marriage.  That was it, I had no strength left to put up my front and I dropped quickly into a deep depression.

Well 5 years later I'm divorced, still unemployed, completely broke and barely surviving financially, have panic attacks when I try to job search, and have zero confidence left in myself.  I feel like a total and complete failure in every aspect of my life.  I even feel like a horrible father because some days I can barely handle the normal stresses of dealing with a young kid and I give into her too often which is leading her down some bad paths health and habit wise.  Almost all my friends are gone.  My supposed best friend left me not long after she saw me at my absolute worst when I was in the hospital after an aborted suicide attempt.   She decided our 20 year friendship meant nothing because I "must always have been a secret narcissist".  When she left, two of my other very close friends went with her since they were closer to her and felt uncomfortable staying my friend given her feelings.  Other friends I wasn't as close with disappeared when I was slow to reply to them during bouts of depression.  They decided I didn't care or wasn't worth it.  Some just didn't know how to deal with me when I was always down and they had known me as the up guy who was always there to support others.

I have nothing left.  There is nothing inside of me.  I want to die all the time. I've been though treatment.  3 doctors, 2 hospital visits, multiple drugs, TMS treatments, ECT treatments, day therapy programs, DBT/CBT training, anything they wanted me to try I did.  Nothing.  I move between moderately depressed on the best day to severely depressed on an average day.  What joys I get last only for a few minutes before I go dead inside again.  My latest doctor when I showed some optimism about trying to change said "its not realistic to expect you will ever be back to near where you once were again" and that he discouraged me from even trying to find work.  I can't live feeling like I have no purpose but leaching off of society and not even having enough to do the things that are important to me.  No money, no job, no friends, what's left?

The only thing that's held me back for the past year is my daughter.  She's 10.  She is all that matters to me.  I don't want to desert her, but I often question if I add anything to her life anyway.  And its hard to live for "every other week" with someone especially when those weeks can be so hard mentally.

I don't know why I'm writing this except to vent.  The truth is I don't think its "will I kill myself" but when.
