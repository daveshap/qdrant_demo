LAUREN: Goodnight Bears. Goodnight chairs. Goodnight kittens. Goodnight mittens. Goodnight clocks. And goodnight socks. Goodnight little house. And goodnight--
SOPHY: I don't want to move away.
LAUREN: I know, Honey, but just think how exiting it will be-- new house, new school, new friends--
SOPHY: But why can't we stay here?
LAUREN: Because we can't. There's nothing here for us anymore.
SOPHY: Are we in some kind of trouble?
LAUREN: No...
SOPHY: Then how come last night I heard you talking to Logan and you were crying?
LAUREN: What makes you cry?
SOPHY: If I'm sad, or tired, or sometimes when I'm angry or when somebody's being mean to me.
LAUREN: Pretty much the same reasons I was crying. But things will be better when we move to a new place.
SOPHY: Then I'm gonna do what you do to make me feel better when I'm sad.
