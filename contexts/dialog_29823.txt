RAILLY: Cole! James Cole! You escaped from a locked room six years ago.
COLE: 1989. Six years for you. There's the sign! Right here!
RAILLY: I can't believe this is a coincidence, Mr. Cole. Have you been...following me?
COLE: You told me you'd help me. I know this isn't what you meant, but...I was desperate... no money...bum leg... sleeping on the streets. I probably smell bad. Sorry about that. But then I saw your book in a store window with a notice about your lecture. I can read, remember?
RAILLY: Yes, I remember. Why do you want to go to Philadelphia?
COLE: It's the next step. I checked out the Baltimore information, it was nothing. It's Philadelphia, that's where they are, the ones who killed everyone. Zs that a radio? Does it play music?
