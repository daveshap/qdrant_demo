I have a feeling my office might not take me back—does it sound like I need to job hunt?
TDLR; does this situation sound like I’m about to be laid off? My boss has not confirmed I can return. 

I am a college student, and this was supposed to be my third summer working as a legal assistant on a seasonal basis. I am involved in some organizational projects at the office that they always need help keeping up with, but they are technically not urgent. 

During winter break, and spring break I come in when I can, and over the summer I work at least 3 full days a week (most of my coworkers only work 3 days as well because the three of them all happened to be Jehovah’s Witnesses, unlike my boss and I, and they had requested that). 

My office and boss are extremely kind to me and always assure me that they want me to come back the next time I’m home from school, including this year. Normally I just set things up with the paralegal via email because my boss has a hard time fitting in non-client calls. 

But this year, which unfortunately is my graduation year when I need to save, the paralegal told me that my boss would call me soon and to let her know if he needs to be reminded. She doesn’t seem to know what will happen and told me that she misses me (as normal) and to update her on what happened after he contacts me.

It’s been about 2-3 weeks of waiting for a call, and I already contacted her once to let her know, but she sent me back a similar message (let me know if you don’t get a call soon). I didn’t call myself because I know he wouldn’t want to be caught off guard; he likes to plan when he will have conversations.

- Should I assume that he is putting off telling me he can’t afford to have a non-essential team member back this summer? 

- Have lawyers/law firms taken a big hit lately?

- Should I assume that legal work has been extra intense due to COVID related issues and that he’s actually *busier* than usual? 

Thanks!
