GARY: Okay... We're all here. Rick, what's the big announcement?
RICK: All right, gentlemen, I'm not gonna sugar-coat this thing. I've known you guys since grade school, so I'm gonna give it to you straight from the hip... right from the shoulder... without beating around the bush... Nothing fancy, just the plain, hard facts... tell it like it is.
CHULO: Man, you're losing your audience.
RICK: Okay... This is it... I'm getting married.
O'NEILL: What?
CHULO: You're kidding.
