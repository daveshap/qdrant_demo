I've so much things to do, but i don't know WHEN to do it.
I'm an high school student that has a lots of passions and also a social life. My days are always ending in the same way: I go to bed really tired knowing that i didn't do neither an half of the things I put me in charge to do at the beginnig of the day. So really often I loose my motivetion and i stop believing in myself. I hate this. Please, please, help me. What should I do?
