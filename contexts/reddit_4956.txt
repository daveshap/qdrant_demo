Quit my job due to high levels of anxiety. Can't build the courage to conduct exit interview
I've been with the same company for just over 4 years, but the last year has really taken a toll on my mental and physical health. I have panic attacks before work, throw up due to anxiety. Cry at my desk.

On Wednesday, I caught myself thinking 'if a car crash was promised on my way to work, it'd be easier to get out of bed right now.' So I quit, effective immediately.

I understand this might be a hit immature, but it I told my supervisor 3 or 4 weeks ago after a mental breakdown that I needed reduced hours, or a sabbatical, or something to have time to get myself right, but the work just kept pushing forward.

Now our CEO wants to conduct a exit interview, and just opening my email app to offer times sends me into a panic. I tried to schedule a time earlier today and ended up crying myself to sleep.

So here I am. On one hand I feel like a huge weight has been lifted, on the other hand I am absolutely dreading this last hurdle.

I'm not sure what I am looking for.

Thanks.
