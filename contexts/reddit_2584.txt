Why is it so hard to find a job?
I've just been down on my luck. I've been networking, fixing my resume, praying, and applying non-stop. Linkedin, job boards, I mean. I'm 25, nearing 26. I'm not well. Why is it so hard to find a job? I'm not doing good, you guys. I try to be positive and motivated, but it's hard. Rejection after rejection. What do I do?
