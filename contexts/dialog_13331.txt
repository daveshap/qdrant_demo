NATHAN: Bravo to you, Puff!
LILA: That was wonderful!
GABRIELLE: You were wonderful today, darling. Such authority with the ape-man boy. It made me so hot for you.
NATHAN: Unnhh.
GABRIELLE: The way you are taming him, it sends chills down my girlish spine and... everywhere else, too.
NATHAN: Urgh.
GABRIELLE: Take me, darling! Tame your little monkey of love!
