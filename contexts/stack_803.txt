Lenovo x1 carbon 3rd generation touchpad issues I am using Lenovo x1 carbon 3rd generation with ubuntu 18.04, The touch pad is behaving weird like, If you drag the pointer down to a specific point and removes the finger from the touchpad then the pointer jumps to a random position.An example will be closing a browser tab, Drag the pointer x and remove the finger off the pad, The pointer jumps to a random position.Is it normal, Or is there anything which can help around.Thanks
