Why didn't the piece of Voldemort\u2019s soul in Harry come back to life with Harry? I recently reread the books and found it curious that when Harry goes into the Forbidden Forest, and is killed by Voldemort but comes back to life, that the piece of soul in him doesn't come back with Harry. Because Harry never fully reached a state of death, he was just in King\u2019s Cross which served sort of like a purgatory and the part of Voldemort's soul was also there under the bench, so why didn't it stay connected to Harry and come back to life?
