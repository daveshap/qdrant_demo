FOLEY: You excited?
CHINO: I told you, man, Super Bowl Sunday.
FOLEY: Yeah, but I see you moved it up.
CHINO: Why you think is today?
FOLEY: You were out running this morning, sticking to your routine, anybody happened to notice. But you only did a couple of miles instead of your usual five. Saving yourself for the main event. Then I see you inside eating ten pounds of macaroni. Carbohydrates for endurance.
CHINO: You want, I tole you you can come. You all right, Foley. I like you.
FOLEY: You told me I can come 'cause I caught you digging the fuckin' tunnel, saw you and Lulu coming out of the bushes, thought maybe you two were making out.
