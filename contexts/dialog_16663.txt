MONICA: Coach hates me, doesn't she?
SIDRA: She hates all freshmen.
MONICA: What's up with that?
SIDRA: Hey, don't take it personal. And don't think just cause we play the same position we have to compete with each other. We're teammates, okay?
MONICA: Thanks, Sidra.
SIDRA: Besides. I've been starting point the last two years. Ain't no way some dumb- ass freshman is taking my spot.
MONICA: You finish the reading for E-con?
QUINCY: Yeah.
MONICA: What'd it say?
QUINCY: Basically broke down how I'm gonna make mad loot in the NBA, me being such a limited commodity and all.
MONICA: Whatever, big head.
