ETHAN: No, I don't. But in this case -
SWANBECK: In this case, it wasn't a bad idea. In face, it was a pretty damn good idea. Just don't make a habit of it. And, as for Ms. Hall, in light of her efforts, her criminal records will certainly be expunged. I'm assuming you approve.
ETHAN: I do.
SWANBECK: Where is she now, by the way? Do you know?
ETHAN: I don't. No exactly.
SWANBECK: Well, Hunt, what are your plans?
ETHAN: Not sure. Some sort of vacation. I'll let you know where I'm going.
SWANBECK: Oh, you don't have to do that. Wouldn't be a vacation if you did.
