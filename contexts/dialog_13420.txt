RAND: Where do you think you're going?
BETSY: It's my day off.
RAND: But what in the world can you do with a day off in St. Sebastian?
BETSY: I was just beginning to wonder. Aren't there shops, restaurants and things?
RAND: Well -- and things -- might be a better description of what you'll find. I'd better come along and show you the town.
BETSY: But don't you have to work?
RAND: By a curious coincidence, it's my day off, too.
RAND: Bring me another, Ti-Joseph. I have to keep the lady entertained.
BETSY: It must be hard work entertaining me if it requires six ounces of rum.
RAND: What in the world are you talking about? Six ounces -- ?
BETSY: Higher mathematics. Two ounces to a drink -- three drinks, six ounces.
RAND: How do you know there's two ounces in a drink?
BETSY: I'm a nurse. I always watch people when they pour something. I watched Ti-Joseph and it was exactly two ounces.
