How to register with the ALDI talk mobile app? I just purchased the ALDI Talk and went through all the steps for the registration including the online identification. Then, I download the iOS app and it asks to provide the 06-nummer in the app. I attached a screenshot for the process. I believe it has to be 10 digit number in total as the app takes a number to that length.Anyone, please tell me what's that?Edit, I have taken out the picture as that was for the wrong country/language version of the app.
