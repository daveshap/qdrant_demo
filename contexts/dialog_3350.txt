PRESIDENT: ... So what does all that add up to?
KAUFMAN: Well, sir - it occurred to us that he might be an agent of a foreign power. But, we ruled that out, as they invariably are provided with too much documentation, too much American identity... We, uh...don't quite know what to make of it yet, sir... But we'll keep on top of it, Mr. President - we'll come up with the answer.
PRESIDENT: I would appreciate that.
