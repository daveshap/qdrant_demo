Feeling of unpreparedness
Does anyone else have an extreme sense of unpreparedness? 

I'm in my second semester of grad school studying biology and I just have this overwhelming feeling of being underprepared and just failing with my research. I want to get better at this and feel like I'm succeeding but I feel like I'm just running into a wall and at times can't answer questions I should be able to. It's odd because I have been doing well in my classes and don't have any concerns but I feel like I'm floundering for my research. It doesn't help that at the moment my PI is currently out of country and won't be back too soon. I have my method plan I'm going by though and just hoping for the best.

I just feel as if I am not dedicating enough time to my research but at the same time it feels as if I don't know where to invest my time in it. Luckily I have a great support system here, I just am worried about failing them and failing myself. I guess my overall question is: does anyone else have this feeling? And how do you or people manage it?
