Overview of research brief?
Hi all, Iâ€™ve just started a new research project (GIS and mental health) and my advisor has asked for a draft research brief before our meeting next week. All the information I got out of them about it was that it is supposed to be around 4 paragraphs. Can anyone give a better explanation of its purpose and what to include?
