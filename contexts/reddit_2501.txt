I’m settled into my job - and I think everyone forgot about me?
Hey, all. I work at a large manufacturing company, where I am the marketing director. I’m 6 months in, and our growth is through the roof. I’m cranking out projects left and right and our digital presence went from non-existent to very strong in just months. Yet, no one really cares. Like, at all. Never a “good job”, never anything insinuating they value me whatsoever. I don’t get any negative feedback either - just nothing. 

I’m the only person in the entire company who works alone (not on a team), so I want to stay connected to my boss. She routinely blows off our weekly meeting without reason and never reaches back out to apologize, let alone reschedule. Lately, she doesn’t even answer my emails. It makes me feel...stupid? Like my work isn’t that important to her. I honestly think I’m being forgotten about. 

I don’t hate my job, but being in a busy work environment and feeling isolated really sucks. I want to stick it out for at least 2 years, but I’m concerned this is going to stunt my career growth as I’m not learning anything from anyone, other than my own research.
