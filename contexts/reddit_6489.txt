Places where other young adults work? (Stores, Fast food, Shopping malls, etc)
So my seasonal job is ending soon, and Im trying to find a new place. Im in community college, So I can only work less than 40 hours a week.

Im trying to find a job where other young adults/teens work. I like working with older adults...but its just different when I could work with someone my own age. I just get along with them better. Im looking to make friends too. Im also trying to stay away from operating a cash register, as that isnt my strongest skill. I love cleaning, stocking, etc.

Any ideas?
