SAMI: I'm Sami. Marcel sent me.
JULIEN: What is it you do, Sami?
SAMI: You know, a little of this, a little of that. I've boosted cars, stole radios, run a few scams. Right now I'm into pick-pocketing.
JULIEN: I see. A master criminal.
SAMI: Hey, I was told to come here by Marcel. You guys don't want me, I'll be more than happy to leave.
DANIEL: This is Zero.
SAMI: Hi. I'm one and this is two, three, four and five.
