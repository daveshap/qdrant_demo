SSD had windows installed in it.I'll explain step by step the sequence of eventsI tried installing Ubuntu but installation kept freezing at preparing to install which is the step before partitionsI decided to remove my ssd and then try to installIt worked and the install went ahead. I installed Ubuntu on the HDD. Also created a new EFI partition on HDD for Ubuntu.after that I put in my ssd again and now I am getting an error message upon selecting to boot to windows.I am getting Process1 Intialization failed stopcodeI think my partitions are messed up due to two efi which is the cause of this error (if you think it's something else please tell me)Please tell me how I can fix this. Ubuntu is running fine. But I need windows too.Is there any way to combine my two EFI partitions. I am open to loss of data. Please help.
