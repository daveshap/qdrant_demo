BRETT: Why isn't that a good time to quit?
LOTHER: No gentleman would do that.
BRETT: I agree with you--no gentleman, would--But I would-- --especially when my opponents have taken the precaution of marking the cards.
SUMMERS: I thought you were a sucker--
BRETT: Think again--
LOTHER: In that case--you owe us exactly sixteen hundred dollars.
BRETT: Oh, no--I played with <U>your</U> cards--in <U>your</U> cabin--at <U>your</U> suggestion--If you've got a kick coming, make it to the Purser.
LOTHER: I'm making it to you. If I don't get it by tonight--you'll find it a <U>rough</U> voyage.
SUMMERS: That goes two ways.
BRETT: Make it three, boys--I'll play this hand pat.

BRETT: I'll lay odds you get a pair of 'em--Why, a high-school kid could take you saps--and another thing--Lay off Sally Marsh. --Honest Jack"! One look at your mug and the whole world buttons up its pockets."
