Is it possible to get a job as a drug and alcohol counselor when I never myself have been addicted to drugs or alcohol?
I have a BA in Psychology and been seeing lots of drug and alcohol counselling positions lately. I am thinking of finishing my addiction studies classes and then get certified. Wondering if I would be looked down upon because of my lack of not going through addiction? I applied for a basic residential job and was turned down. 

Any ideas?
