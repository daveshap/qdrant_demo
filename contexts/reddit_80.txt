Help with energy and talking to people

I struggle to interact with people without going very over the top, talking too quickly and just being too hyper. I think it’s because I worry too much of what people think of me (I’ve tried to stop but it’s difficult) It’s really really draining, I get headaches if I have to talk to people for too long. I just want to be able to talk to people without using all of my energy but at the same time not appearing rude.
