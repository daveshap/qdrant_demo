REGGIE: It's not exactly what I'd call a large turn-out.
SYLVIE: Didn't Charles have any friends?
REGGIE: Don't ask me -- I'm only the widow. If Charles had died in bed we wouldn't even have him.
SYLVIE: At least he knows how to behave at funerals.
SYLVIE: Have you no idea who could have done it?
REGGIE: Until two days ago all I really knew about Charles was his name -- now it turns out I didn't even know that.
SYLVIE: Do you know him?
REGGIE: I've never seen him before.
SYLVIE: He must have known Charles pretty well.
REGGIE: How can you tell?
SYLVIE: He's allergic to him.
