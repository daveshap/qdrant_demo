Two of the best dates ever, back to back
So I met this guy through matching on tinder on the first day I got the app, and then finding out our parents were friends (my mom had planned to introduce me when I moved!). We shortly moved over to fb messenger after and have been messaging for just over a month.

We finally met on Monday and had a great first date- he actually picked me up to drive me to a job interview and waited in the car while I was at it- then he drove and toured me around the city near where we live (I recently moved to where he lives hence the one month of just messaging), then we went out for a nice lunch. He paid for lunch but I paid for the ice cream after, which was also delicious. After that, we toured around some more before going back to his place and playing video games for a while before my mom asked me to come home for dinner. 

Originally we had plans to play soccer in the evening the next day but he asked if I was down to spend the day with him tomorrow in the city we were going to play soccer in. So he picked me up right in the morning and off we went. We had breakfast and lunch together, went shopping, even met his grandma and toured around the city a bit with her. He also took me to an arcade which was fun too! We went back to his house and played more video games before heading out to play soccer, and then he drove me home in the evening. 
It was two of the best dates I have ever had! I was beaming all day! He even texted me after to say he had a great time too ☺️

We have some set plans for next week too and I’m really looking forward to seeing him again. I’m quite new to tinder so not really sure how to progress from here, but I think we both get the sense that each other is interested in the other.
