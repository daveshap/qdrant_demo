LUKE: Comin' out here, Boss?
BOSS PAUL: Yeah. Come on out, Luke.
LUKE: How'd you find me?
ARLETTA: Helen, she sent along your things with a note, and John here, he wrote to the police.
LUKE: Yeah. Well. Gettin' up here, Boss.
LUKE: Well, Arletta, I got to stand down here.
ARLETTA: I allus hoped to see you well fixed and have me a crop of grandkids to kiss and fuss around with.
LUKE: Like to oblige you, Arletta, but right off I don't know where to put my hands on 'em.
ARLETTA: Sometimes I wisht people was like dogs, Luke. Comes a time, a day like, when the bitch just don't recognize her pups no more, so she don't have no hopes nor love to bring her pain. She just don't give a damn. They let you smoke?
LUKE: Smokin' it up here, Boss.
LUKE: Yeah, well, Arletta, you done your best. What I done with myself is my problem.
ARLETTA: No it hain't, Luke. You ain't alone. Ever whar you go, I'm with you, and so's John.
LUKE: You never thought that's a heavy load?
ARLETTA: We allus thought you was strong enough to carry it. Was we wrong?
LUKE: No. But things ain't always like they seem, Arletta. You know that. A man's gotta go his own way.
ARLETTA: Well, I don't know, I just wash my hands of it, I guess I just got to love you and let go.
LUKE: Yeah.
ARLETTA: What are you doin' here?
LUKE: We call it abuildin' time, Arletta.
ARLETTA: I ain't askin' what you'll do after you get out, because I'm gonna be dead and it don't matter.
LUKE: You never wanted to live forever anyways, did you? It wasn't such a hell of a life.
ARLETTA: Oh, I had me some high old times. Yore old man, Luke, wasn't much for stickin' around, but damn it he made me laugh.
LUKE: Yeah, would of been nice to of knowed him, the way you talk about him.
