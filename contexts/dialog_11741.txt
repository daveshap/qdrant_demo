TOM: She gonna be long?
GRACE: Probably. She's on the phone twenty- three hours a day.
TOM: What does she do?
GRACE: She's an editor.
TOM: Mmm. An editor.
GRACE: Not like books or literature or anything. Just a magazine... Just in case she hasn't told you -- which I'm sure she hasn't -- I don't want to be a part of this, OK?
