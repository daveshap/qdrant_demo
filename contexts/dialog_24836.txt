TAYLOR: We don't.
DAWN: Well maybe there's a way out of here.
TAYLOR: Fat chance of that. Even if we had C4 and a laser torch these doors wouldn't budge. That son of a bitch...that stupid son of a bitch.
DAWN: Given a malfunction, how would a rescue team get you out if the doors won't open?
TAYLOR: Probably come through the wall I suppose.
DAWN: Well maybe we can do something like that.
TAYLOR: I don't think you know what you're talking about. Besides, what could we use for tools? A steak knife? A corkscrew?
DAWN: Just considering our options... sir.
