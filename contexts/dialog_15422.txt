CALLER: Hello, Peter.
PETER: You sonofabitch!
CALLER: Emotional? I expected more from you.
PETER: If you kill tonight and I'm in jail the police will know I'm innocent.
CALLER: By that time the game will be over.
PETER: I've figured out the message.
CALLER: No you haven't. And even if you had it doesn't matter. Who would you tell? The police don't believe you, and you've just used your only phone call.
