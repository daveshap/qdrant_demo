Today I got fired from my job. I don’t know what to do next.
I have had a difficult time finding a job in my industry, spending over 8 months searching for employment off and on for the majority of that time. I finally landed a job, an hour and a half away from home. It was a huge load off my mind. But today I got into work and was handed a termination letter. 

I’m an apprentice, and at my last job I wasn’t given a lot of learning opportunities. I feel like it was a lot to do with the fact I was always the only woman on the floor. But the fact remains I’m a second year apprentice, and I guess I didn’t live up to this new place’s expectations. 

It’s already so hard for me to find a job in my field. I’m so distraught, I’ve had a great track record until now. I’ve never been fired before, let alone not even having worked for the place for a month. I don’t know what to do. I love what I do and I didn’t want to go work flipping burgers but I guess if I have to I will. I just don’t know, man. But right now I’m so not okay.
