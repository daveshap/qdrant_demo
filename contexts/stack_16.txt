No input fields for the Apple ID Verification for the iMac 10.10.5 Just as my heading says:  There is no input fields for the Apple ID verification codes for the iMac 10.10.5. How in the heck do I get it to come up??For example, I try to log on to iTunes on my iMac normally, and then it asks for the 6 digit verification code from another device. Okay, no problem. I retrieve it, and when I come back to the Mac, there's no input screen to key in the verification codes. It leaves me hanging.
