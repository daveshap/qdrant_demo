YORGI: Cops. Like a plague. No matter how many you pay there's always another with his hand out. How did you pick him out?
XANDER: He flashed his badge to half the bar when he bought his drink.
YORGI: I appreciate you bringing this to our attention. Whatever you want, the rest of the night, consider it on the house.
XANDER: Thanks, but I'm here on business. I heard you're the G around here. I'm looking for some cars, expensive ones. A lot of them.
YORGI: Sorry, man, don't know what you're talking about.
XANDER: I'm talking about the sports cars that disappear off the docks in Genoa and wind up here. If you don't know about 'em, who does?
