Where now: advice needed
Hi all! 
I am currently in the last stretch of my masters of HEA degree, as I’ll be completing my capstone/PC in the fall. I’m ending a graduate assistantship this upcoming month and am in the process of looking for full time positions (I can’t take another GA because I’ll only have it for one semester). 

Here’s my problem: I can’t find any jobs to even apply to, and I’ve had one interview that I choked with. I’m location bound due to medical issues and can’t find any positions that I’m eligible to apply to (think PhD requirements or 10 years+). 

What are some similar fields that I could also apply to? I’m trying to stay in higher ed long term but I need to find something for now that fits the same themes. 

Questions, advice, personal stories are welcome.
