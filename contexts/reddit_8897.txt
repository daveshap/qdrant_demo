What is the history and current practice of tribal citizenship and affiliations in the United States, and how do the recent DNA test and press statements of Sen. Elizabeth Warren fit within that history and current practice?
Recently, Sen. Elizabeth Warren [released the results of a DNA test](https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2018/10/15/warren-addresses-native-american-issue/YEUaGzsefB0gPBe2AbmSVO/story.html) which indicated that it was likely she had a native american ancestor [“in the range of 6-10 generations ago.”](https://mk0elizabethwarh5ore.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Bustamante_Report_2018.pdf)  This was done as a response to [allegations she has faced around claims of such ancestry while she was a law professor before entering politics.](https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2018/09/01/did-claiming-native-american-heritage-actually-help-elizabeth-warren-get-ahead-but-complicated/wUZZcrKKEOUv5Spnb7IO0K/story.html)

In response to that test, [the Cherokee nation secretary of State noted that "A DNA test is useless to determine tribal citizenship."](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2018/10/16/cherokee-nation-slams-warren-dna-results/1656463002/) 

So from all this, I am wondering how exactly does tribal citizenship work in the US?  How did it develop over time?  Are claims like Warren's common?  And how does the [semi-sovereign nature of tribes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribal_sovereignty_in_the_United_States) factor into determining who controls the rules of membership themselves?

Edit: Warren put out [this video posted by her campaign](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHzbdZuVyAM) which includes some relevant statements from her.  Normally we would also require a transcript to go with it, but I haven't been able to find one, and it's a sufficiently relevant source that the mod team has decided to make an exception to allow citation to the video as to statements Warren makes in it.
