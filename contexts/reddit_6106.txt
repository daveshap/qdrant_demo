Leave apprenticeship after this corona pandemic or hold on to it till the economy bounces back?
So I am currently a 18 year old Security Technician apprentice, a field I don't want to continue in and I have little interest in and working with people I am no so thrilled to work with, so I'm planning on looking for a new job (a casual or part time job on the side while I go through Defence Force recruiting) after the restrictions with the virus is lifted or at least when the restrictions come to a point where looking for a new job is appropriate. However, I am not sure about the economy side of things and if that might impact what ever job I get in the future if I do decide to leave, so I am at a crossroads. Should I continue my apprenticeship which I don't like so I have income or should I leave now or later and get a different job? I also don't have bills or recurring payments to make apart from streaming services (Disney Plus, 2 anime streaming sites and Apple Music)

Also: I have already done the first step of the recruitment process with the Defence Force and I can apply to the jobs I am eligible for for 3 years before I need to do it again, and I can do the role I want to do in the ADF (Australian Defence Force) but my apprenticeship is 4 years and I don't want to lose the role.

(Didnt know if I should put a Corona or Job Searching flair, COVID-19 seemed more appropriate)
