There they go.. jail again.
If you want to know more you can ask. 

I've been trying to go out with a girl for a while (around two years.). For almost two months I was debating telling her how I felt, and I finally did Thursday night. At around 4 am, you know, so she'd wake up to the love note kinda thing. No response all day. I see her online on Facebook and I start to talk to her. Turns out it's her mom. She and her sister are in jail. Apparently they got into a fight (they like to wrestle each other)and they found "Drug instruments (and weed bowl). Since they're adopted the parents said "Fuck it, I don't want them." So now they're in jail until they're 18. This isn't their first time in jail. One always runs away because her adoptive parents abuse her mentally, the other always gets in fights..

To compact it even further, I haven't eaten since Thursday since my ulcer gets worse with stress; I can't even hold down liquid. 

Oh, and I had a fight with my own family. To the extent that they threatened me with forcing me to live with my abusive dad if I went to go see them.. I'll give you five guesses which I chose.. so now I may never get to see them again.

But is that a bad thing? I mean would they even remember me or care about me after 487 days of no contact? Would they be the same people? Will I?

Teenage drama.. yay.

EDIT: Apparently the one guy I've been grieving with all night is going to jail too because one if the sisters ran away to his house.
