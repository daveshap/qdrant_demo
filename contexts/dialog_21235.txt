BETTY: Why no. She's still on her date with Biff ... is something the matter?
DAVID: No, I ... I was just ... worried about her.
GEORGE: Bud, your sister's a little older now and she's naturally going to start going out with boys. ... In fact pretty soon--she's even going to get married and make someone a good little home-maker like your mother here. That's IF she can learn to bake.
BETTY: Oh, George ...
GEORGE: But your sister is a fine young woman and she would never do anything for us to be concerned about.
