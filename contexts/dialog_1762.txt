Z: I feel...isolated. Different. I've got abandonment issues. My father flew away when I was just a larva. My mother didn't have much time for me...when you have five million siblings, it's difficult to get attention. I feel physically inadequate -- I've never been able to lift more than ten times my own weight. Sometimes I think I'm just not cut out to be a worker. But I don't have any other options. I was assigned to trade school when I was just a <u>grub</u>. The whole system just...makes me feel...<u>insignificant</u>.
MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR: Terrific! You <u>should</u> feel insignificant!
Z: ...I should?
MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR: YES!!! You know, people ask me, Doctor
