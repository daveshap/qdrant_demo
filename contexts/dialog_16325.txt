LOGAN: How long have you been living here?
OLD MAN: For as long as I can remember.
LOGAN: What kind of place is this?
OLD MAN: Just a place, I suppose... who knows?
LOGAN: How did you get here?
OLD MAN: I have always been here...
LOGAN: Are there any other humans?
OLD MAN: Gracious... no.
LOGAN: Have any other people ever passed through?
OLD MAN: But there may be a few around somewhere.
LOGAN: What makes you think so?
OLD MAN: My parents thought so. Mother and Father. You know?
LOGAN: Mother and -- ? You knew your mother and father?
JESSICA: And... and how were you grown? Inside your mother?
OLD MAN: Yes...
JESSICA: Are you sure?
OLD MAN: Mother and Father said so... you know?
LOGAN: Where are they?
OLD MAN: Dead... they're dead... and buried.
