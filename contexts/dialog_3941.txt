ADAM: Troy? Is he your husband? Or a boyfriend?
EVE: No.
ADAM: Thank-Q!
EVE: Oh, stop that! God! Listen, I know you like me. I can tell. But you know what? A lot of guys like me. Not me, exactly. It's more like the legs or the butt or the hair. Or some combination of the above.
ADAM: I think it's the eyes.
EVE: The eyes. Okay. An eye-man. Anyhow, it never works out. Okay? Not that you even need to know that! You look like crap, by the way. What have you been doing?
ADAM: Watching television in color.
EVE: Hey, no kidding? In color?
ADAM: Cross my heart and hope to die.
EVE: See, ya.
ADAM: Why doesn't it never work out?
EVE: What?
ADAM: Why does it never work out? You and...men?
EVE: Why?! Who the hell knows?!
ADAM: ...Okay.
EVE: It never works out because I'm into legs and butts and hair myself! That's why! So I wind up with guys who are very good looking, but even more shallow than I am, if you can picture that. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go find another low-paying, demeaning job where some guy named Jerry keeps telling me how lousy his marriage is.
ADAM: Why not go to work for me?
EVE: Doing what?
ADAM: Selling all my baseball cards. And helping me buy enough food and supplies to fill several large trucks.
EVE: Food and supplies? Who for? Like starving people?
ADAM: Well, they're not starving yet, but they need help.
EVE: How long would you need me?
ADAM: Two weeks.
EVE: What's the pay?
ADAM: What's fair?
EVE: I've got to make at least a thousand a week.
ADAM: You got it! Wait here while I change.
EVE: Sure.
