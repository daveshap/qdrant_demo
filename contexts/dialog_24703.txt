DAVID LEE: Yes, sir...
NATHAN LEE: You oughta be tired, too, Sounder. That possum shore whipped the hell outta you tonight!
DAVID LEE: He beat you, too, Daddy, and you had a big ol' shootin' rifle.
NATHAN LEE: Boy, you don't make funny with your daddy like that.
NATHAN LEE: David Lee...
DAVID LEE: Yes, sir...
NATHAN LEE: You had a rough time out there tonight -- so you stay home from that school tomorrow.
DAVID LEE: I wanna go -- the trip don't bother me none.
NATHAN LEE: You learnin' anything at that school?
DAVID LEE: Yes, sir -- I learn to write a little bit, and I can read a lot--
NATHAN LEE: Readin' must be somethin' powerful, huh, son?
DAVID LEE: Yes, sir...
NATHAN LEE: When the fall comes in these parts, the Night moon runs away like a rabbit -- you could stay out here lookin' all night, and not see a thing out yonder.
DAVID LEE: We goin' huntin' again tomorrow ?
NATHAN LEE: Yep. I guess you must wonder why though, what with the luck we havin', but like I always say--
DAVID LEE: You lose some of the time
NATHAN LEE: Now who says I didn't lay my mark on you, boy!
REBECCA: David Lee, it's time for you to get to bed!
DAVID LEE: Goodnight.
NATHAN LEE: Night, son!
REBECCA: And don't wake up Josie Mae and Earl!
