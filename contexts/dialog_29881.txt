DONNA: Do you think that if you were falling in space you would slow down after a while or go faster and faster?
LAURA: Faster and faster. For a long time you wouldn't feel anything. Then you would burst into fire... forever.

LAURA: Okay, I suppose I should go home.
DONNA: Call me.
LAURA: Sure. What do you want me to call you?
DONNA: Call me anything just don't call me late for dinner.
