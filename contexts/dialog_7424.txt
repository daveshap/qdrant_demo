JABEZ: How'd you know to have the calf ready, Ma?
MA STONE: I just figgered -- knew you didn't have enough bills.
JABEZ: Yes -- and you figgered right, consarn it!
MA STONE: That's a word you're too free with lately, Jabez, consarn this and consarn that ...
JABEZ: Helps sometimes to say it.
MA STONE: All right, son -- if it helps.
MARY: Jabez!
JABEZ: Seed alone won't do, Mary. We have to throw the calf in.
MARY: Oh Jabez! And we were counting on ... It's a lovely calf.
JABEZ: You're right, Mary it's a fine calf. That's why Stevens'll take it for the rest of the payment.
