Those of you who had plenty of well-paying job opportunities right out undergrad, what was your degree in?
Out of high school, I didn't know what I wanted to do so I majored in Social Sciences. 10 years and one useless degree later, I want to go back to school and get a degree that will set me up with an easy job hunt and a good salary.
