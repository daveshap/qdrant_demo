JOSS: ... What I'm curious about are the wilderness years. You're out there all alone, no money, mocked by the skeptics. It must have taken tremendous faith.
ELLIE: I'd say logic more than faith. The odds were on my side.
JOSS: And what would you have done if the odds had gone against you?
ELLIE: I guess I would've felt sorry for the universe.
JOSS: Spoken like a true believer.
ELLIE: What about you? Doesn't all of this shake your faith at all?
JOSS: How do you mean?
ELLIE: Well it's been a while, but I don't recall the Bible saying too much about alien civilizations.
JOSS: 'My father's house has many mansions.'
ELLIE: Very smooth. It's Palmer, right? Where I came from a palmer was a person who cheated at cards. Really though... the Bible describes a God who watches over one tiny world a few thousand years old. I look out there and see a universe of hundreds of billions of galaxies, each with hundreds of billions of stars... I mean burn me for a heretic, but your God seems awfully small.
