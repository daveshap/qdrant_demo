Help regarding my girlfriend
In my last post I talked about how I needed help with my girlfriend and stuff I can’t really remember so maybe read that one.

Now I’m kinda scared to break up with her (both 13f) because I asked her over Instagram what would happen if we broke up and she freaked out and said that we *would* be friends but it’d take time for her (which is obviously ok and normal). But then the next day I was hanging with a mutual friend and she texted me saying she was really stressed and freaking tf out. I sent a meme of Michael Myers which made me and my friend laugh and I said that Myers was my true love and she was my side hoe as a joke and she said she’d just not reply so I said sorry.

So we said sorry and stuff and she texted “I love you” and I looked to my friend (I told her I was thinking about breaking up) and I just know it’s not right and I feel horrible for saying “I love you too” back. She started texting me a lot saying that I was amazing and she loves me so much and I feel so so guilty and I don’t know how to break up with her. I have no idea what to do cause I know it’ll fully shatter her to fucking pieces if we break up.

She kept sending hearts and calling me amazing and I have to say it back and stuff so she doesn’t feel bad (she ALWAYS uses the “🥺💖” emojis and I just fucking can’t break up with her now I’m feeling manipulated? I don’t know how to do anything right now.

Please help me
