SALIERI: Wolfgang, what is it? Sta calmo, per favore. What's the matter?
MOZART: It's unbelievable! The Director has actually ripped out a huge section of my music. Pages of it.
SALIERI: Really? Why?
MOZART: I don't know. They say I've got to re-write the opera, but it's perfect as it is. I can't rewrite what's perfect. Can't you talk to him?
SALIERI: Why bother with Orsini-Rosenberg? He's obviously no friend of yours.
MOZART: Oh, I could kill him! I mean really kill him. I actually threw the entire opera on the fire, he made me so angry!
SALIERI: You burned the score?
MOZART: Oh no! My wife took it out in time.
SALIERI: How fortunate.
MOZART: It's not fair that a man like that has power over our work.
SALIERI: But there are those who have power over him. I think I'll take this up with the Emperor.
MOZART: Oh, Excellency, would you?
SALIERI: With all my heart, Mozart.
MOZART: Thank you! Oh, thank you.
