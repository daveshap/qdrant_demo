I know a good way to help with anxiety attacks.
When you feel an attack coming what I like to do is use my senses.

Eyes: look for 5 different thing you can see.what can you see?

Ears: listen for 4 different things. What can you hear?

Touch: look for 3 things you can touch. What can you feel?

Smell: look for 2 things you can smell. What can you smell?

Taste: looked for 1 thing you can taste. What can you taste?
