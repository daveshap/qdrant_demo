How has the Magnitsky Act impacted Russian entry into the US? How has it influenced trade negotiations between Russia and the US?
In 2012, the United States Congress passed a law known as the Magnitsky Act that barred certain Russian citizens from traveling to and entering the United States. The law requires the government to identify Human Rights abusers from Russia, and bar them from entry. 

This act was passed as a clause in one of the first formalized trade agreements with Russia (since the fall of the USSR) where:

> The most immediate effect of the bill would be to formally normalize trade relations with Russia after nearly 40 years. Since the 1970s, commerce between Russia and the United States has been subject to restrictions that were intended to punish Communist nations that kept their citizens from emigrating freely.

[Putin believes that the act is largely political and is used as a tool to control Russian trade negotiations. Putin is a vocal critic of this law as well.](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/07/13/the-putin-obsession-that-led-to-trump-jrs-meeting-215374)


Some discussion questions: 

* How has the Magnitsky Act influenced US-Russia relations? How frequently is it invoked? 

* Or is it keeping high-profile financial criminals and human rights abusers from Russia out of the US? 

* Has it been effective in at least impeding the interests of the people the Magnitsky Act was intended to work on (at least in the US)?

* How has this law impacted Russian entry into the US since the law went into effect?
