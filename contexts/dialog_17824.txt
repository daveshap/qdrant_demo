JOE: They wrong?
RATSO: No. But while you was buying the underwear, I could have lifted the socks.
JOE: You couldn't lift fly specks from a sugar bowl. Can you hold this?
RATSO: But thanks. Hey, Joe, don't get sore about this or anything. You promise?
JOE: Yeah.
RATSO: Well, I don't think I can walk. I mean, I been falling down a lot and, uh...
JOE: And what?
RATSO: I'm scared.
JOE: What of?
RATSO: What'll happen. I mean what they do to, you know, do with you -- if you can't -- ah, Christ!
JOE: Who?
RATSO: I don't know. Cops. Or the -- how should I know?
JOE: Okay. Here it is. You gonna go see the doctor. I got nine bucks and twenty more Thursday and I gonna be riding high before you know it. So you gonna get you the best goddam doctor in this town and get yourself straightened out, that's what.
RATSO: No doctors. No, sir. Not me. Doctors are like goddam auto mechanics. Fix one-thing, unplug another. Operate for piles and while they're there, they unscrew your liver. My old man, for God's sake, wasn't any sicker'n I am when he went to the doctor.
JOE: Well, just exactly what the hell you think you're gonna do? Die on me?
RATSO: I'm going to Florida, that's my only chance.
JOE: You know what's wrong with you? You got fevers. You kinky as a bedbug. How you gonna get to Florida?
RATSO: I'll find the money. If you just get me on the bus, that's all I ask.
JOE: Just when everything's going my way, you gotta pull a stunt like this.
RATSO: I don't even want you to go. Whaddya think of that? I got other plans for my life than dragging around some dumb cowboy that thinks he's God's gift to women. One twenty-buck trick and he's already the biggest stud in New York City. It's laughable.
