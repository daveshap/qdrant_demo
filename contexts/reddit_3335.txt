Corona virus has a surprising benefit in dating
So I live in South Korea.  Here, nowadays, you rarely see anyone’s face because everyone wears a face mask.

So I matched with this guy on a dating app.  He’s a pizza maker/delivery boy about a 5 minutes walk from my apartment.  Probably have seen him a few times even.  But I thought he was cute in his profile, and moreover goofy, which is 100% my style

We had a plan to meet up later this week for the first time but today after work he texted me saying he just got off work and wanted to see (just my face!!) for a second.

I decided to be spontaneous and go, no makeup and leisure clothes in all.  I came out, and we immediately started going for a walk (masks on).

We ended up walking and talking and joking and holding hands for two hours.  (Don’t worry korea isn’t quarantined, my area is small and there was literally no one around) His profile only had one picture, so I wasn’t sure exactly what he looked like.  By the end of it, i realized I only saw his eyes the entire time.  I mentioned it.  But at the same time, I felt like it really didn’t matter.

The whole time we didn’t have to worry about appearances, just talk and have fun

Not going to lie, it was kind of nice.  Thanks corona for this new face-free dating experience~ we will see each other again in 2 days :)
