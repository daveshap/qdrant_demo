After months of unemployment due to anxiety and depression, I’ve now landed myself a job
I’ve had anxiety and depression for quite a while, years; it usually creeps up on me but then goes away, it depends on my mindset and lifestyle. Last year I lost my job (lost as in I had no choice but to leave due to my mental health) and went spiralling down, living off my savings which weren’t a lot at all.

Now, I can proudly say I turned up for an interview shaken and paranoid to be working there today and it feels great to be distracted. I can be on my own, I don’t have to talk to people all day and it’s laid back; perfect for myself.

I am extremely proud of myself, although I still have a lot of issues with my mental health I need to address, small steps like this really help everything else.

Thanks for reading :)
