MICHAEL: A ray of oneness piercing the solitude. Falling bodies in the ecstasy of flesh. You'll be a chapter in my memoirs of desire.
PEGGY: Is that one of your poems?
MICHAEL: No, I just made that up. Do you want to hear one?
PEGGY: I'd love to.
MICHAEL: Okay. Here's a new one. It's called Tenderness. I couldn't sleep so I thought I'd scream Betrayed by a kiss, sucking pods of bitterness. In the madhouse of Dr. Dread Razor shreds of rat puke fall On my bare arms I'm sorry. I guess I was trying to impress you.
