Got a job but the road to it feels bizarre...
me (28) is graduating in October this year in business/IT related studies and since dec. 2019 i was trying to land a job to have some safety and enough time to search. So basically i get rejections or and no answers until March.

Thats when the pandemic hit and i reapplied to some companies...

First one rejected my initial application but offered me 2 jobs based my CV and they were excited to get to know me and scheduled an interview.

3 Days later another company calls me for a traineeposition and schedules to get to know me.

First company both interviews went well and i shall deside within a week or two and tell them if im interested.

Second company i was late for the interview, they asked me some basic questions and some i call it "HR-questions". 

Got the offer to be a Trainee the next day... and i took it after a week :)

Anyway does anyone of you have experience with Traineeprogramms? How was it? Do i have to prepare?
