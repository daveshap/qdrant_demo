DEBI: Okay. Let's catch up. You go first.
MARTIN: Well, there's not much to tell.
DEBI: I'm sure you've done worthwhile things in the last ten years. You've had experiences.
MARTIN: Bad experiences.
DEBI: You met people.
MARTIN: Bad people.
DEBI: Watched television?
MARTIN: Bad television.
DEBI: Jesus. Marty. You're pathetic. It sounds like you need a Shockabuku.
MARTIN: What's that?
DEBI: It's a swift spiritual kick to the head that alters your reality forever.
MARTIN: That'd be good.
