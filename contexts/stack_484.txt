Virtualbox Ubuntu 17.04 cannot connect to the internet I upgraded Ubuntu 16.04 LTS to 17.04 last two days ago. Ever since, I've been trying to connect to the internet, tried to change the 'bridged adapter' under setting > network. left at \"NAT\" ( as default option ); still didn't work. I tried a few things that I saw on Youtube, but still is not connecting to internet. At some point, I noticed under \"VirtualBox Host-Only Network #2\" IPv4 was set to some random IP address within my subnet mask  (at least looked that way to me). I changed to DHCP hoping it would fix the issue. No luck. At this point, I have feeling that if for some one who is familiar with VM than I am, it might be just a few clicks and fix the issue. I seemed to cannot figure that out. Can someone shed some light on what should I do next please?
