QUINN: M.J., I'm going to have to borrow Ruben. The alien-smuggling thing in Chinatown is going down tomorrow night and Jack's kid got hit by a car. I gotta give Ruben to Nikko.
M.J.: What does this mean? Now we got the FBI, my team is expendable? I'm working my ass off, is anybody listening? Why Ruben, anyway? He and Nikko don't even get on together...
QUINN: Teach both of them a lesson in cooperation and self-discipline.
M.J.: If this is a first step in kicking me off the case, just tell me, to my face, sir, don't waste time being diplomatic.
QUINN: Just, I need results. And -- I am short-handed. Who else am I gonna give him?
M.J.: Give him <u>that</u>pompous son of a bitch.
