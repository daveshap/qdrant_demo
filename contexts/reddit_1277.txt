I’m crying because the pharmacist treated me like a drug addict
(UPDATED!)Today l went to the pharmacist to get my prescription of 7 pieces 0.5 mg xanax that my psychiatrist gave me for my generalized anxiety disorder carrying my passport like they asked of me and because in my country people my age don’t have any other id (15) and she refused to give it to me saying she needed an id card and people go around asking for this stuff so l told her l don’t have an ld card and to give me my other prescription of Cipralex and she refused and left the window. It scarred me and l’m scared to ask for my prescription of xanax in any other pharmacy.

Update: l’m so happy right now! I went to the pharmacy again today with my older sister to see what was the problem and there was another pharmacist working there and he was super polite and said again that they accept only an id card and made a phone call for us and recommended another pharmacy chain we could go to who will accept a passport, so we went to the pharmacy and they were super nice also and gave me the meds with no problem. This was my first time ever picking xanax and it was so scary but l got thorough it with your kind words and advice! Thank you all so much everyone who upvoted and replied :).
