[Quick list] ish
- My grandpa passed away on Tuesday night, I feel like I didn't spend enough time with him near the end
- Although I'm technically accomplished in my career, especially for my age I still feel like I've hit a wall that I can't move past (I'm a graphic designer.)
- My love life has come to a screetching halt. I manage to bad a one nighter once every month or so but my life is completely devoid of any meaningful intimate relationship and has been for over 10 months now
- I cant seem to get my finances on track so that I can save a decent amount, no matter how hard I try
- The friend I'm supposed to be moving in with is so bad with money that we've had to postpone the move date by 3 months now
- I'm trying to start up my own studio with a friend, we both work for a studio currently and have the skills to go it alone except for the fact we're both completely disorganised.
