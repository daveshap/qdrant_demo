What do to after hierarchical clustering and finding number of clusters I have a dataset with 10 categorical variables with over 5000 observations, I have clustered and then found the optimal number of clusters using elbow method.Now I'm not sure what to do because I'm left with 4 clusters which are still hard to interpret.The aim of the analysis is to see if there are trends in the data.
