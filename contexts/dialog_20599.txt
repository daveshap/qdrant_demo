RAFE: Sorry.
DANNY: Why be sorry? That's what you feel, it's better to come out with it.
RAFE: I didn't mean it.
DANNY: Sure you did. So come on. Say what you think.
RAFE: Waitress! Four beers!
DANNY: You don't wanna put beer over mai-tai.
RAFE: If you can't keep up, don't drink yours.
RAFE: We gotta face some facts here.
DANNY: What facts are those?
RAFE: I understand how it could happen. I know why any guy would love her. And I can't blame you that it happened. You thought I was dead, she was grieving, you were trying to help her.
DANNY: I was grieving too.
RAFE: Yeah, right. Anyway, you didn't know.
DANNY: So what are you saying?
RAFE: I'm saying now you do know. So it's time for you to fuck off.
DANNY: You left her. How's that for a fact?
RAFE: How's this for a fact? I loved her first.
