Predictive classification including varying information about classes I'd appreciate help conceptualizing a problem. I constructed a supervised training set where user inputs carry the correct classification. In building a classification model, I'll strip out the correct class label and try to predict it using features linked to the inputs. What makes this more challenging than a simple classification problem (at least for me!) is that there are known, class-specific details that can vary on a day-to-day basis. For instance, some days Class A might be much more likely than Class B (empirically). So I'd want to pull the model toward Class A on some days.Does this type of problem have a name? My searching has not been super productive, and I think I could use some help with the right terminology. Second to this, I'd also appreciate any thoughts about promising solutions to investigate. Bayesian hierarchical models that make use of this prior information?
