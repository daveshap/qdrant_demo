REX: ...Well, my wife has me between a rock and a hard place.
MILES: That's her job. You have to respect that.
REX: When I first met Marylin -- Well, we were crazy about each other. Not emotionally, of course. We just couldn't keep our hands off each other.
MILES: Mm.
REX: But then... But then...
MILES: Time marches on. Ardor cools.
REX: No. Not exactly. It didn't exactly cool. Marylin is a knock-out. And very sexy -- but -- there's a lot of it out there.
MILES: Ah.
REX: You know what I mean when I say it.""
MILES: Gotcha. No need to get anatomically correct with me, Rex.
REX: Seems like there's more of it than ever before --
MILES: Well, with the expanding global population -- Let me ask you this -- your wife. Has she pursued the opportunities which must present themselves to the knock-out
REX: I don't know. I can assume...
MILES: Not in court you can't. Has she retained counsel?
REX: I'm not sure.
MILES: And your wife is aware of or has evidence of your activities?
REX: Video.
MILES: Mmm... And to cut to the chase, forensically speaking -- is there a pre-nup?
MILES: The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves. Well, let me ask you this: what kind of settlement do you seek? What are, for you, the parameters of the possible?
REX: That's the problem. I can't afford to give her anything.
MILES: Nothing?
REX: I know that sounds rough but I'm about to close on a deal to develop some mini-malls, and I'm mortgaged up to my ass. If this deal goes south, I'm ruined -- I'll lose millions.
MILES: So, you propose that in spite of demonstrable infidelity on your part, your unoffending wife should be tossed out on her ear?
REX: Well -- is that possible?
SARAH: You want to come out to the beach house tomorrow?
MARYLIN: I didn't know Barry had a beach house.
SARAH: Neither did I until my lawyer found it -- quite a paper trail -- he had it in the dog's name.
RAMONA: So who'd you hire?
MARYLIN: Ruth Rabino.
SARAH: She's a legend. Didn't she do Kravis or a Pearlman? She definitely did a Factor.
MARYLIN: She did a Harriman.
SARAH: Wow.
MARYLIN: In the words of my Private Investigator, we're going to nail his ass.
RAMONA: I've been trying to nail George's for years, but he's very careful. I'll just keep having children. I think I'm pregnant, by the way.
SARAH: Ramona! Don't get Mia Farrow on us.
RAMONA: Three is not Farrow.
SARAH: Who's Rex's guy?
MARYLIN: Miles Massey.
SARAH: Of Massey Myerson?
MARYLIN: Do you know him?
SARAH: By reputation. He got Ann Rumsey that cute little island of George's.
RAMONA: George was so impressed he hired him when he divorced his second.
SARAH: Muriel Rumsey.
MARYLIN: Who's she?
SARAH: Now? She's a night manager at McDonalds.
RAMONA: You should have tried to get pregnant Marylin -- solidify your position.
MARYLIN: No.
RAMONA: You like kids.
MARYLIN: I can't have a baby with a man I don't love... And I can't submit a child to divorce.
SARAH: It's not so bad these days. Kids like joint custody. Two sets of toys.
RAMONA: Maybe next time.
MARYLIN: Maybe.
SARAH: We do have a man for you.
RAMONA: Thorstenson Gieselensen. He just separated from his third. He's in fish. He is fish.
SARAH: She's keeping his name. And one of his planes. And all seven of his children
RAMONA: And only two are hers.
MARYLIN: Please. I'm not seeing anyone until this is over. One husband at a time.
SARAH: I wish I had your discipline.
LAWYER: Mrs. Guttman, you have testified that you were your husband's sexual slave for thirty-six years, ever since you were married --
WITNESS: Except for two years when he was in the Navy, in Korea.
LAWYER: Prior to your marriage, what was your profession?
WITNESS: I was a hostess. For Trans-World Airlines.
LAWYER: What is your husband's profession?
WITNESS: He manufactures staples and industrial brad-tacks. He's very successful.
WRIGLEY: Wait... He wants to give her...?
MILES: Nothing.
WRIGLEY: And she has...?
MILES: Video.
WRIGLEY: What the fuck...?
MILES: Wrigley!
WRIGLEY: Sorry.
MILES: Sometimes I have serious doubts about you.
WRIGLEY: I am very sorry.
MILES: Am I mentoring the wrong mentee?
WRIGLEY: No. You're not.
MILES: I could be mentoring Kramer. Kramer clerked for Scalia.
