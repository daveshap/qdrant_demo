The only thing I’m really sad about.
I’m not sad about getting rejected by 13 out of the 16 schools I applied to. I got in to some decent safeties so I’ll be fine.

What I’m sad about is that I’ll never be able to feel the emotion of getting accepted into the school I really wanted. Instead, when I look back on this part of my life, I’ll only remember the boring, dull feeling of opening all 13 rejection letters.

I wish I could have felt that emotion, opening up a decision letter, being surprised about the result, crying tears of joy, rushing to find my family and tell them “I got in!!!”. Instead, each time was me casually letting them know I got rejected from somewhere.
