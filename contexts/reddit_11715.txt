Girl I'm talking to was in an engagement of 2 years with a guy she dated for 4 years. He left her ~8 months ago, this is how I'm being treated...
So for the sake of the story we will call her Alice. 

Alice and I have known each other for 9 years. We re connected shortly after she was left (I hadn't talked to her much before then, I saw she had been left, I tried to help her through her emotional troubles). 

This was 6 months ago. She had been single for 2 months. We hung out, talked, she shared her stories and I tried my best to help her get through it. We began hanging out so much that 3 months into our reconnection, I had begun to form feelings. I decided to brush them off as they seemed selfish and childish given her circumstance. Well maybe a week or two after I began feeling that way, she told me she did also which made me feel great. 

Fast forward 3 months and here we are. We are best of friends with a weird relationship-like friendship. She says she wants to be my girlfriend at some point, but first needs to still take it slow. She SAYS take it slow so she can be sure I'm not "another one of those guys", but recently I found out she's still (reasonably) hung up on the failed engagement. I completely understand it. 

The thing is, she's treating what we have much like a real relationship. She's expecting me to be exclusive, not hang around anybody that "has feelings for me", etc. 

Is this fair? I should say something right? It's been 3 months now that we've been talking, kissing, cuddling, hugging, going out to dinner ... And yet she doesn't want a relationship. She can't give me an idea of when she will want to call it official. 

Sorry for the long speech, I know most of you won't read through it but for the ONE person who does, I'm just wondering if I'm wrong for thinking I should be allowed to live the single life while she is wanting to "take it slow" and get over this other man?
