Never believed in senioritis
Until I became a senior.

Like damn, I can't even motivate myself to do homework anymore let alone work on my college apps (6 done, 12 more to go wooooooooo :))))) ) I legit do nothing everyday but surf youtube and A2C while being stressed about writing college apps and then feel super guilty and depressed abt not doing work when I go to sleep, which keeps me awake for another hour. I just can't wait for college app season to be over cuz then maybe I'll be able to get back on my feet after taking some time to recharge.
