GORDO: Moonan. Here. Shit...
LILY: So what? We just stay clear of him.
LILY: Jesus... Take it easy.
JAKE: No, I'm not going to take it easy. You can't stay clear of this guy. He will be on this until the end of time.
MILES: What do we do? We change the scam?
JAKE: There is no scam! I've got a fucking sign on my back! I can't leave town now and come back with a suitcase full of money. You get it? It's over. We walk.
GORDO: Jake --
JAKE: What do I always tell you guys? Don't spend it all. Sooner or later we're going to run into some bad luck. Save some. Put it away, so when shit like this happens, you're not desperate. That's it. The gig's up.
LILY: That's it? What are you talking about? We can still do this!
GORDO: Jake, I mean, come on --
JAKE: No, no, no! Not this time. I am doing this for your own good! You guys have got to learn when to stop. You with the Armani! You with the hookers!
MILES: Escorts!
JAKE: Do you even remember Al? Do you remember what he looked like sitting there?
LILY: You are such a raving pussy sometimes.
JAKE: Hey, we fucked once, honey. That hardly makes you a good judge of character. And don't think I didn't know you were working some angle with that either.
LILY: Everyone's working an angle, right?
JAKE: There are three people I trust -- him, him and a guy who got killed. I don't know who you are! You're like some stray dog that wandered into the house. So I'm telling you to cut loose of this. No one's looking for you, Not the King, not Moonan and not Gillette. Just go wherever it is you would go. It's over.
LILY: What about...
JAKE: What about what?
LILY: What about the money?
JAKE: So there it is. You got that big itch you need to scratch. It's all about the fucking money. What do you want, an apology?
LILY: No, I want my cut!
JAKE: I'm going to say this one last time for you, so take a deep breath and count to ten. There is no cut.
