Got rejected after 3rd interview
I had my third interview with a job I really wanted earlier this week. I was informed over email yesterday that I didn’t get the position. I’m really bummed. I’ve been unemployed a little over two months now and I was really optimistic about this one. My first two interviews went really well. The third one was alright, but I was uncomfortable (it was really hot and I was in my room interviewing via webcam and was literally dripping with sweat halfway through the interview). It wasn’t bad, but it wasn’t my best. I just feel rejected and sad and a bit defeated. I’m trying not to wallow. I’m trying to tell myself that after only two months, getting this close to a job is an accomplishment. But I can’t shake the sadness and dejection I feel.


I guess I’d like some reassurance. Am I going to be ok? How do you guys practice self care after a rejection from something you were really looking forward to and optimistic about?
