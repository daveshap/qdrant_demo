I just had a really positive supervision meeting
A bit of an r/CongratsLikeImFive moment here, but after having a few months of supervision meetings where I felt constantly behind and out of my depth and being softly criticised by my main supervisor, today I was able to have a meeting where I was on top of all my material and was able to make some definite decisions. Not a big deal, but I just wanted to share this feeling with others who might get what I'm talking about!
