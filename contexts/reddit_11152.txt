I got a detention at my school for the funniest reason ever
I brought a minecraft iron sword to school (the foam one), and a kid said I BROUGHT A REAL SWORD TO SCHOOL. WHAT THE HELL. So I talked with the counselor, and they had to search my bag. They also said I can't bring sizzors to high school anymore. The rip form said "Max brought a foam sword to school for non academic reasons" WHAT ACADEMIC REASONS WOULD I NEED A SWORD FOR!??
