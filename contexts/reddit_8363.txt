What measures are there to prevent a single Senator from holding up actions that have bi-partisan support?
The House almost unanimously passed a resolution yesterday requesting the public release of the Mueller report, yet a single senator blocked the Senate from voting on it. What measures are there preventing a single senator from holding up resolutions or legislation from being voted on, and are non-binding resolutions treated the same way as legislation in this regard?
