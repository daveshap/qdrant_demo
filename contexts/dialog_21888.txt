DOYLE: He has a six months lease, and has used up a little over five and a half months of it. Quiet. Drinks, but not to drunkenness. Pays his bill promptly, with money earned as a consume jewelry salesman -- wholesale. Keeps to himself, and none of the neighbors got close to him, or his wife.
JEFF: I think they missed their chance with her.
DOYLE: She never left the apartment --
JEFF: Then where is she -- in the ice box?
DOYLE: -- until yesterday morning.
JEFF: What time?
DOYLE: Six ayem.
JEFF: I think that's about the time I fell asleep.
DOYLE: Too bad. The Thorwalds were just leaving the apartment house at that time.
DOYLE: Feel a little foolish?
JEFF: Not yet.
