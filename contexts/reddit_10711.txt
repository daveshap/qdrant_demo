My depression has made me become such a good liar. It’s frightening.
When you tell everyone you’re okay but you’re actually not. 

You promise them you won’t do something, but your mind tells you otherwise. 

It’s hurts being under such intense emotional pain. 

It’s hard seeming like you’re the happiest person out there and fully functioning but know deep down inside while you’re alone that you’re so fucking unhappy. So fucking unhappy.
