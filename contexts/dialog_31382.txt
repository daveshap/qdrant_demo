CRABTREE: Fascinating. Listen, why don't you come out with us after the lecture. There's a place on the Hill I always get Trip to take me.

GRADY: That's really it.
JAMES LEER: The one she wore on her wedding day?

GRADY: Really.
JAMES LEER: They're glass. The buttons.
GRADY: Like the lady herself.
