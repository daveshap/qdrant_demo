LYDIA: He said if I let him out he would take me over to the other side to find you.
BARBARA: No, Lydia, we're dead.
LYDIA: I want to be dead too.
BARBARA: No you don't! No... Lydia... Why?
LYDIA: Life is just... too awful.
BARBARA: Lydia, believe me... we know... all the hard stuff is the same over here. You're going to be who you are... whether you're alive or dead ... and over here -- it's... It's flat... there's no food, no colors ... you can't smell the flowers. If we knew then what we know now we'd have been more careful...
ADAM: ... we wouldn't have had our little accident.
BARBARA: So, <u>never</u> let Beetle Juice out. Never. Besides... We're thinking about letting everyone stay... You and your father and mother can stay too.
LYDIA: Step... mother.
ADAM: What is going on?
LYDIA: Really. I don't know.
