Advice for someone who has a pay-cut yet the amount of work is increasing twofold.
Hey guys! I need advice or help. 
My company decided to cut 70% of our wages due to the onset of the coronavirus. But at the same time the amount of projects have doubled. Im the only videographer/ motion graphic artist in my company hence i have to deal with projects for all the clients. I know leaving the job is not an option as it the worse possible time to do so. 
How do i move about this situation? 
Im barely making money and feel stagnant at this point of time.
