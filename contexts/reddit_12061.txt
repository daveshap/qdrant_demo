I just found out earlier today that one of my closest friends has been murdered.
Part of me feels morbidly curious about the details of the stabbing. I want to know why, how. I want to know what his last moments were like... I think I'm angry that this happened, only right now I'm not sure of how I feel.

Right now, I feel guilty. I havent seen him in over a year. The last time I saw him, I was walking in the mall with my husband two floors down from where he was, and somehow, my friend saw us. He yelled for me. in my confusion, I almost just walked away. He yelled and yelled and told me to just wait there. He ran down two flights of escalators to me and tackle-hugged me. He was just heading home and so were we and we took the train together. I told him he looked good in his outfit, dress shirt, slacks and suspenders. I teased him about his murse.

It still doesnt feel real...
