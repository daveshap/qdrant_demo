MR. BLONDE: What's this guy's problem?
MR. WHITE: What's my problem? Yeah, I gotta problem. I gotta big problem with any trigger-happy madman who almost gets me shot!
MR. BLONDE: What're you talkin' about?
MR. WHITE: That fuckin' shooting spree in the store.
MR. BLONDE: Fuck 'em, they set off the alarm, they deserve what they got.
MR. WHITE: You almost killed me, asshole! If I had any idea what type of guy you were, I never would've agreed to work with you.
MR. BLONDE: You gonna bark all day, little doggie, or are you gonna bite?
MR. WHITE: What was that? I'm sorry, I didn't catch it. Would you repeat it?
MR. BLONDE: I said: Are you gonna bark all day
MR. PINK: Both of you two assholes knock it the fuck off and calm down!
MR. WHITE: So you wanna git bit, huh?
MR. PINK: Cut the bullshit, we ain't on a fuckin' playground! I don't believe this shit, both of you got ten years on me, and I'm the only one actin like a professional. You guys act like a bunch of fuckin' niggers. You ever work a job with a bunch of niggers? They're just like you two, always fightin', always sayin' they're gonna kill one another.
MR. WHITE: You said yourself, you thought about takin' him out.
MR. PINK: Then. That time has passed. Right now, Mr. Blonde is the only one I completely trust. He's too fuckin' homicidal to be workin' with the cops.
MR. WHITE: You takin' his side?
MR. PINK: Fuck sides! What we need is a little solidarity here. Somebody's stickin' a red hot poker up our asses and we gotta find out whose hand's on the handle. Now I know I'm no piece of shit... And I'm pretty sure you're a good boy... And I'm fuckin positive you're on the level. So let's figure out who's the bad guy.
