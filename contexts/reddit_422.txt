Am I doing something wrong ?
So I’m currently in a relationship and I’m so happy. But there’s one problem I feel like I make him upset a lot. Idk if it’s because I tend to over think a lot or he over thinks but I just keep making him upset and it hurts me to see him so upset. I wanna know if I should do something and if so what is that something?
