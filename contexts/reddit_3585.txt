You guys I did it
I finally asked out a girl I like. For the first time in my 27 years of being alive I had the guts and just asked her. I have known her for a while and think she likes me as well and after weeks of consideration and making excuses, I just typed the text into my phone, set a one minute timer on my watch and hit send the second it hit zero. I know text isn't the preferred way, but this is a huge step for me.

My heart is still racing and I have no reply yet, but I will report back :)

UPDATE: well this certainly blew up. Sorry for the late Update, but I was sleeping/at work. So far I got no reply. She often takes days to reply to my/her friends texts, but I figured sheâ€˜ll make an exception for getting aksed out, so I will take it as a no for now.
Thanks for rooting for me tho, really made my day a bit better
