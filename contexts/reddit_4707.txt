In case you don't get to hear it today, i love you!
As arbitrary as it sounds coming from some random internet dude, we all deserve some love. Some piece of mind a feeling that we are not alone even if you feel that way. Even if there isn't positivity in your real life, you deserve to be loved, so i love you, everyone have a blessed morning. Try positivity and stay strong.
