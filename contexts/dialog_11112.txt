WHALE: That shirt, Mr. Boone.
CLAY: It's new.
WHALE: I'm sorry. It's too white, too distracting. Would it be asking too much for you to take it off?
CLAY: I'm not wearing an undershirt.
WHALE: Pish posh, Mr. Boone. I'm not your Aunt Tilly.
CLAY: But it's just my face you want to draw.
WHALE: Oh if it's going to make you uncomfortable... Perhaps we can find something else for you to wear.
WHALE: We could wrap this like a toga around your shoulders. Would that help you overcome your schoolgirl shyness?
CLAY: All right already. I'll take it off. Kind of warm in here anyway.
