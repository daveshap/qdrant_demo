I think I broke my TV
For some context my family recently moved to Canada (5 months or so) and were currently living in the basement of some family friends and paying rent. The place is alright but a bit small. We only have one TV and I think I broke it. I was playing fifa and I think my brother accidentally touched the plug or something and it turned off during and important game. I threw my controller on my TV stand thing which I usually can egt away with cuz the controllers quite durable. But I was not prepared for it to bounce off the table and hit the TV. The screen is cracked and currently my family don't know. They're like 10 feet away from me rn. What do I do? Does anyone know how much it costs to fix a TV and how long it takes?
