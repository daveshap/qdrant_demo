How does anyone find dating fun? It’s easily one of the worst things to go through in life
Seriously it’s such a shit show. You go through hundreds of people and don’t find anything worthwhile 

For guys it’s even worse because your self esteem gets utterly crushed. You go on apps and swipe on 500+ women and get NO matches
