Goodbye I guess <3
Hey Reddit,

The internet is a scary place however real life isn't much better. I like Reddit because it is mostly anonymous, you could be my best friend, my cousin, my brother and not know whose post you were reading and I like that because some things you just don't want people to know. People in my life know I'm falling apart but they don't know quite how bad it is, how messed up and broken I am I mean fuck, they thought I was over everything that happened a few years ago but little do they know it still catches up to me every once in a while, makes me break down crying. Anyways, I feel like on Reddit it's hard to picture users as actual people so I'll set the scene slightly. Hey, I'm Scarlett and I'm currently living in the UK. I suffer from a lot of mental illnesses and honestly I've grown up ignoring my diagnosises because if I'm being honest, I don't care. My friends have no idea that I suffer from bipolar either and it's fucking hard to keep that one to yourself but I'm trying my best. It feels like every day i feel worse and worse and I just hurt myself more and more. I don't really see a point for me to carry on anymore, I'm a burden to every one I know and I'm so fucking greatful that they put up with my shit And smile even though they have their own stuff going on and I just wanted to say thank you. There are so many reasons I don't want to be here anymore but in reality, does it even matter what the reasons are? I don't plan on living much longer and if I don't have time to write a note then I guess this is it. I'm sorry for wasting your time, hope you are all having a nice day, and remember, it may be too late for me, I have made up my mind but life is beautiful and I hope that whatever your going through, you find a way to get through it. 

Goodbye for now,

Scarlett x
