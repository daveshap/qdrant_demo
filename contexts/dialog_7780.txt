HARRY: ...and who was Benjamin Franklin again?
LLOYD: The pilgrim who used penicillin to kill Godzilla.
HARRY: I didn't know that.
LLOYD: Welcome to public school, my friend.
HARRY: Hey, teach, how'd you get so smart?
LLOYD: When you live in the basement of the school, you breathe in a lot of chalk dust. It writes out all the answers on your brain. Now how about a slushee?
HARRY: A. Slushee. Don't tell me. Abraham Slushee. Third president of the United States.
LLOYD: And he invented fire.
