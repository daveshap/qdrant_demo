PAUL: We needed somebody who knew the lay of the land. Somebody who'd been to this island before.
GRANT: I have never been on this island!
PAUL: Sure you have. You wrote that book...
BILLY: That was Isla Nublar. This is Isla Sorna. The second island.
PAUL: I didn't know, there were two islands.
AMANDA: Still, you have survived the dinosaurs before. You saved those kids.
GRANT: A few of us survived. A lot more died. And we were better prepared and better armed. How many days have they been missing?
