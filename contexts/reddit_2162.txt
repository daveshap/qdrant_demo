Toxicity on this sub
Especially after Ivy Day, I am so done with elite kids who think that the Ivy League is the only place to be and essentially worship it, while at the same time saying to every other redditor that 'Purdue is so good!' and 'omg, Penn State! It's what you make of it!' 
All schools are good. If you're the ones that are all 'worried' about what happens if you don't get in, because 'my parents went there and my whole family went there and I could NEVER go to any of my safeties' then don't tell others that their college is a perfect choice. Actions speak louder than words, so be careful about saying 'iT's WhAt YoU mAkE oF It' when you don't follow that advice yourself.

Edit: wow guys, thanks for the reaction. One thing I want to clean up: *you are not automatically a bad person if you go to an elite school*. Plenty of good, kind people go to T20s. Just try not to lord your school over others'.
