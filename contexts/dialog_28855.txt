CLOSE SHOT GASTON: still studying the vase. Mariette appears. He turns to her.
MARIETTE: Where did you find it?
GASTON: You know the main staircase in the opera?
MARIETTE: Yes.
GASTON: Then you go to the left. There's a landing.
MARIETTE: Yes.
GASTON: Then you go into the foyer.
MARIETTE: Yes.
GASTON: And as you leave the foyer, there is a little niche.
MARIETTE: I know that niche.
GASTON: And in that niche, there is a statue of Venus.
MARIETTE: I remember.
GASTON: You like that statue?
MARIETTE: Not particularly.
GASTON: Neither do I. That's where I found it.
MARIETTE: I don't know how I could have lost it there. I was nowhere near that niche.
GASTON: Oh ... That's strange. Maybe--are you sure this is your bag?
MARIETTE: Of course it is! Are you doubting me?
GASTON: Not in the least, madame. But you see, it's a very expensive bag--one has to be careful.
MARIETTE: Well--I am Madame Colet.
GASTON: And I am M'sieu Laval--if you will allow me to introduce myself.
MARIETTE: Well--how do you do, M'sieu Laval?
GASTON: The pleasure is mine, madame.
