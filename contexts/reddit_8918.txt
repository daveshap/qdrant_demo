What are some things we could do to prevent the next pandemic?
I looked up the research on the risk of emerging diseases, and found this source on the subject. It has over 2,200 citations, and it was the most thorough analysis I could find, since it looked at all harmful pathogens in humans, and also which have emerged recently, and what their characteristics were.

The paper finds that 75% of emerging diseases are zoonotic, meaning they are able to transmit from animals to humans, virusâ€™s especially so.

What have governments done in the past to contain the spread of zoonotic pathogens from being transmitted to humans initially? Has there been attempts to create a pandemic/emerging disease prevention policy, rather than a mitigation policy? Have there been any governmental agencies that have had forums or policy discussions around this topic, even if they have never taken any actionable steps? If they did consider an actionable step but did not take it, what were their concerns?

Thank you.
