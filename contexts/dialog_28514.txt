NICK: Oh, it's a fire hydrant.
NORA: Yes. It's Asta's Christmas present.
MACAULAY: I got word from Wynant this morning...
NORA: So did we. I mean, Sherlock here.
MACAULAY: What are the chances of getting you to do what he wants?
NICK: Slim.
NORA: Oh, please, Nick.
MACAULAY: Would it help any if I could persuade him to meet you?
NICK: It might.
MACAULAY: He gave me a code message to insert in the Times, in case I wanted to get in touch with him.
NICK: It wouldn't hurt to put it in.
MACAULAY: I've done that already. He should appear, you know. It doesn't look well... his staying away at a time like this.
NICK: Hello.... oh, just a minute. Police department?
MACAULAY: Hello.... Where? In Allentown. Yes... When is the next train? Right - I'll get that. Wynant's tried to commit suicide. They want me to come down and identify him. I guess this changes the whole story, doesn't it? That looks like an admission of guilt. And I had such hopes. I thought if you got on the case, you'd be able to clear him. I thought that Mimi.... the way she acted... I was sure that.... Oh, well, well... it's no use thinking of it now. I'm sorry to have wasted so much of your time.
NORA: Well, that's that. Stay there, Nick!
NICK: It's not going to hurt me to get up.
NORA: Sit down!
NICK: You talk as if I were Asta.
NORA: All right, hard guy. Get up and bleed on the rugs.
NORA: What's the trouble, Asta? Your balloon busted? So's mine.
NICK: What's the matter with you?
NORA: The mystery's all gone. And I wanted you to find out who did it.
NICK: Maybe I will.
NORA: But Wynant --- ?
NICK: I don't believe he did it.
NORA: Why don't you?
NICK: No reason. Just a hunch. But I'm going to find out. I'm tired of being pushed around.
NORA: So am I.
NICK: Come on, Watson, we're going places.
GUILD: Good morning --
NORA: Good morning, Lieutenant - Sorry.
GUILD: You oughtn't to play this trick on me. Running out when I was giving you time to rest up before I asked you those questions.
NICK: You mean about that gun?
GUILD: That ain't a gun any more. The firing pin's busted - the - Don't waste time talking about that.
GUILD: Man to man, Mr. Charles, are you working on this case?
NICK: Man to man, I'm not.
NORA: But he's interested!
GUILD: I don't mind telling you I'd rather have you working with us than against us.
NICK: So would I.
GUILD: It's a bargain then. Anything you want to know?
NICK: What about the suicide?
GUILD: Oh, that's a phoney. The men didn't even have to go down.
NICK: I thought it might be. From now on, they're going to think that every thin man over six feet with white hair is Wynant.
NORA: Do you think that Wynant did it?
GUILD: Looks like he planned, something. He shut up his apartment and his shop.
NICK: You've been there?
GUILD: Yeah. Couldn't find a thing. This is the way we figure it. Wynant goes to Julia's apartment. He finds Morelli there... sees she's two- timing him. They have a fight. But he figures he don't want to do anything then.... Morelli might squeal. So he goes away. He don't let his lawyer know anything has happened... he lets him go ahead and and hand over money to Julia to give to him, so that Julia will think it's all blown over. Then, when she don't expect it... he lets her have it.
NICK: No proof?
GUILD: Nothing yet to cinch it.
NICK: Fifty will get you a hundred that he didn't do it.
GUILD: What do you mean?
NICK: For one thing, he was too absent- minded to hold a grudge.
GUILD: Who's your candidate?
NICK: I haven't got that far yet. But I don't think that everything points to Wynant. What about the alibis?
GUILD: They're all O.K. Mrs. Jorgensen, the boy, Dorothy, Macaulay... even Morelli... we had to let him go.
NICK: What about Jorgensen?
GUILD: I'll check on that. I'm afraid this is kinder dull for you.
