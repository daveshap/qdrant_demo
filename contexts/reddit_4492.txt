Can you be depressed and not suicidal?
I know its probably a stupid question but I really dont know.

Ive had symptoms of depression for a long time, and ive moticed them because friends of mine have been diagnosed for the same things but my friends have all had suicidal ideations at one point or another so I have this mental wall in my head that I cant ask for help because im not really depressed unless im suicidal too.

Is it worth me going to the doctors and seeing what they can do or will they really just not do anything unless im a risk to myself like ive read online?
