PETER: We'll keep talking. Until they get here. Then...
HELEN: I have no life anymore. I ruined your life, make me pay for it.
PETER: Why did you do that? Didn't you have any idea how hard it was for me, to get that far? I worshipped you. You inspired me. I thought you could understand me the way you understood the others. I knew that about you -- the ones you admired were the great murderers; they fascinated you.
HELEN: That's not who I admire -- I admire people who are good at what they do, great artists, writers, thinkers...
PETER: I don't have the talent for any of those things. All I have a talent for is death. And I am one of a kind. What do you think of your student now? I have made you famous, I am your creation and your monument.
