WAYNE: You can't be serious?
ROGER: I'm as serious about that as I am about going back to the donut store, and dipping that stupid Mexican's head into the batter for forgetting my chocolate cream filled. Gimme that other box.
WAYNE: Huh uh. This dozen is for Mickey.
ROGER: That dumbass probably put my chocolate cream filled in there by mistake.
WAYNE: Roger, no.
ROGER: What's the big deal? Take out my chocolate cream filled, put one of these roasted coconut---
WAYNE: Roger, do you understand what the word 'no' means? It's important we establish a rapport. Something as simple as a dozen donuts can mean the world to somebody who hasn't had a donut in a year.
ROGER: So you're giving a man who butchers whole families, little babies included, my chocolate cream filled?
WAYNE: Okay, guys, we're here. L.A. County Jail. Julie, just park in the front.
ROGER: Wayne---
WAYNE: Roger, I'm starting to get pissed. Just drop this fuckin' donut shit, and gather your gear.
