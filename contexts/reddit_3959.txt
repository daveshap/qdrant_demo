No matter how much I prepare myself for getting ghosted it still hurts a bit
I’ve been ghosted a couple of times and it sucks. The first two times it made me crazy. I kept asking myself what I did wrong. Sent numerous unanswered messages to the “ghoster” and just generally felt horrible. This time though I don’t really care. I haven’t technically been ghosted yet but I can feel it coming. I had already told myself don’t get too attached because they’ll probably ghost you. It sucks knowing that another person doesn’t like me enough to be in a relationship but I understand that I just might not be their type. I wish ghosting wasn’t so common and people would actually tell you why they don’t want to hang out anymore. But it’s just something I had to get used to. I’m not going to lie it still hurts. Just a lot less than the first couple of times.
