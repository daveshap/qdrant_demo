UPenn Interview
I applied to Penn (UPenn) through the Questbridge National College Match. I wasn't expecting an alumni interview, because I didn't think there is anyone where I'm from (Northern Virginia). Yesterday, I got a call from someone pretending to be a “secret service” agent. What secret service agent would call a random high schooler and tell them they’re “secret service”. After a brief conversation, I realized she wasn’t kidding. I was supposed to interview with a Penn alumnus who worked in the White House, but she wouldn’t say who. She offered to send me a car the next afternoon to bring me to the White House. After a multitude of security checks, I was led into a room. It was a weird room because it was oval-shaped. A minute later, guess who enters the room. The man himself. We talked for about an hour, and he assured me that I was definitely getting into Penn and that a rejection letter was fake news.
