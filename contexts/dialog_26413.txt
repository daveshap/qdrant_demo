PERRY: Lois, I've got to hand it to you. You're amazing. Who else could manage to turn a three-week tropical vacation into a front page story that's going to blow the lid off government corruption in the Caribbean?
LOIS: I just knew I was onto something when that taxi driver kidnapped me.
CLARK: You're the best, Lois.
LOIS: I'd better be. Suddenly I've got competition to keep up with. Your high school reunion article. I though it was terrific. And fascinating. Especially about the girl back home. I'll tell you what, Clark, I'll take you to lunch and you can tell me all about it.
CLARK: Gee, I'm sorry, Lois. But I've already got a lunch date. With Mr. White's new secretary.
LOIS: Oh?
