ROSEN: How's the journal?
WALTER: I'm still thinking about it.
ROSEN: I wish you'd give it a try.
ROSEN: You don't like coming here, do you?
WALTER: It's okay.
ROSEN: But you don't like coming here. Be honest, Walter.
WALTER: Honest? No.
ROSEN: Good. That's an honest answer. And why don't you like coming here?
WALTER: Honest? Your cheery personality makes my skin itch.
ROSEN: Is it just my cheery personality that makes your skin itch?
WALTER: Forget it.
ROSEN: Maybe it's the way I look. Or the sound of my name.
WALTER: Rosen? I don't have a problem with that.
ROSEN: Because if you did, I know a therapist named Ryan. I also know a therapist named Chung.
WALTER: I don't need someone else.
