Are there insects or spiders on Voyager? At the end of \"Homestead,\" as Neelix is preparing to permanently leave the ship, Tuvok stops him. Before he's able to speak, Tuvok looks down and grinds his foot into the ground for a few seconds. Is he smashing a bug?                            This is but one piece of circumstantial evidence. There may be more, but I'm unsure of them presently.
