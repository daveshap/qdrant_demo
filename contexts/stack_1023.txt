Increased encrypted partition size but Gnome Files still thinks it's small I have an installation of Ubuntu Desktop 18.04.1 running in VirtualBox 5.2.20. When I first installed it, I made the mistake of giving the VDI a capacity of only 20 GB. That filled up fairly quickly, so I decided to enlarge the VDI and home partition. The home partition is encrypted with LUKS. I used VBoxManager to increase the capacity of the VDI to 100 GB, then I booted the Ubuntu VM and installed GParted to enlarge the partition. It worked perfectly, the machine boots fine every time and Gnome Disks shows the partition scheme exactly as expected. The problem now is that Files thinks the partition capacity is still 19.2 GB and still shows me constant warnings about low disk space. At this point the disk has 18.1 GB of data on it, so it's not \"full\" (according to Files) yet. I've been googling but haven't found a solution yet. Any ideas? Also, if the data on it goes over what Files thinks the capacity is, will that cause problems?
