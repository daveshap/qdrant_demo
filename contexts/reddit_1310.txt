Does anyone else have the feeling of being on temporary time? Like, "Things are just weird right now. I'll have everything together soon."
It's hard to describe, so I'll just put it in an example.

My hobbies include drawing, writing, and guitar. A while ago, I decided I'd practice one for an hour each day, alternating every day. Not bad, right? A solid, simple plan.

Today, I hardly look at my guitar, and spend a few minutes scribbling on notebook paper before deciding I just don't feel like drawing. I keep telling myself, "It's just a weird time, what with all my pending homework. Once I get caught up, I'll start practicing." or, usually, "Things are just strange right now. Once this time passes, I'll start."

I feel like I'm just stumbling through days, and have no control. I can't keep a plan because I always use the excuse of "Things aren't right. Once [x happens], I'll be ready." Right now, I'm waiting until summer break to start my routine. I know that, once summer comes, I'll just make more excuses.

Does anyone else feel that way? How do you get over the feeling of "It's not my fault, things just aren't right?"
