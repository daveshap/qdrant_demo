MARY: Oh, no, George, don't. It's full of romance, that old place. I'd like to live in it.
GEORGE: In that place?
MARY: Uh-huh.
GEORGE: I wouldn't live in it as a ghost. Now watch . . . right on the second floor there.
MARY: What'd you wish, George?
GEORGE: Well, not just one wish. A whole hatful, Mary. I know what I'm going to do tomorrow and the next day and the next year and the year after that. I'm shaking the dust of this crummy little town off my feet and I'm going to see the world. Italy, Greece, the Parthenon, the Colosseum. Then I'm coming back here and go to college and see what they know . . . and then I'm going to build things. I'm gonna build air fields. I'm gonna build skyscrapers a hundred stories high. I'm gonna build bridges a mile long . . .
