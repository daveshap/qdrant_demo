GILL: You're welcome.
PLAGUE: What's going on? Let go of me! Stewardess! I'll never fly this airline again!
DADE: You look good in a dress.
KATE: You would have looked better.
DADE: Wanna go for a swim?
KATE: I can't believe they decided you won.
DADE: They didn't. The guys felt it was the only way I'd get a date. Anyway, you're pretty good. You're elite.
KATE: Yeah? You know if you would have said so in the beginning, you would have saved yourself a whole lot of trouble.
