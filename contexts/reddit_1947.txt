Will you people stop with these mindless posts
“Oh you don’t need to go to an ivy to succeed! Your state school is the better option for CS” *Literally going to HYPSM* and talks about umich and Berkeley and Gt (computer science!) like it’s “not *that* bad to go those schools”

I’ve seen so much mindless bs like this on this subreddit. Stop trying to spread the mindset that prestige doesn’t matter because 1. We know, it’s been posted a million times and 2. You’re not fooling anyone that you’re supposedly humble when you say “i’m lucky enough to be going to harvard, but prestige doesn’t matter” 

Downvote me to oblivion, but you know I’m right

Edit: definitely not saying *all* of these posts are mindless. Many of them are indeed in good spirit.

Edit 2: I have come to realize the post i was exemplifying was not actually that mindless and I was wrong for assuming to. Regardless, there are still many other actual “humble brag” posts being posted frequently and I’ll keep this post up for that reason. Please don’t hate me have a good weekend and stay safe yall
