What caused the explosion in healthcare costs in America in the early 1980's?

For years, I've been trying to research what made healthcare costs skyrocket in the early 1980's. None of the explanations I ever got were sufficient, because they never seemed to even hint at that it largely started in the early 1980's. The only reason I'm even citing this article, is because I can't find any other article or blog that even addresses changes made to our healthcare system in the early 1980's.

The article states that the government switching from paying full price for public health expenses to a fixed amount per visit caused insurance companies to start acting more like businesses. This is allegedly what caused healthcare costs to skyrocket in America. The article says that an overall push toward deregulation and HMO's also played a role. I still don't know what to think of this, because of a lack of resources on my part.

Is the author of this article on to something, or is there more to it? Could anything else have played a role in skyrocketing healthcare costs?
