PERRY: All right, Kent. I just hope you know what you're doing. If you really think Smallville is your big chance, go for it.
JIMMY: What about me?
PERRY: What about you?
JIMMY: A story like this cries out for great human interest pictures. The big dance! The Homecoming Game! Mr. Kent posing next to his old locker!
LOIS: Hey, I'd definitely shoot color on that one, Jimmy. It'd be a crime to just use black and white.
PERRY: Okay, Kent, call your people and tell them the Prodigal Son is coming home. FAVORING CLARK -- Happy now, he turns to leave the office. SHOT LOSES PERRY but we continue to hear his voice, o.s.
PERRY: -- but you deserve the vacation, Lois.
CLARK: Oh. You're going away.
