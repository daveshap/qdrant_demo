TIMMY: No class.
DOUG: None at all. I wonder what the Brebner twins are doing tomorrow night.
BRODY: Can you take a little time out from your busy schedule to dance with the old man?
ELLEN: Why?
BRODY: Because they're playing our song.
PETERSON: May I have this dance?
BRODY: Sorry, I'm all booked up... Come, m'dear.
BRODY: Remember 1959, the Jersey shore?
ELLEN: And how. I thought you wouldn't respect me.
BRODY: I did, I did.
BRODY: Listen -- what are you doing later?
ELLEN: Fooling around?
BRODY: Right.
ELLEN: Let's get the kid home.
BRODY: Home it is.
