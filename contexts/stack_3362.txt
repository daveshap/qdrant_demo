How was the Statute of Secrecy breached in 1749 and what measures were introduced to prevent a recurrence? In Harry Potter and the Order of the Pheonix, during the History of Magic O.W.L., Question 5 asks that:<blockquote>  How was the Statute of Secrecy breached in 1749 and what measures were introduced to prevent a recurrence?</blockquote>Does any one have any idea what this was about? Just curious to know since Rowling doesn't mention it in any of the books I have read yet.
