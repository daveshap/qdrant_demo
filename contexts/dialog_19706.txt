NINOTCHKA: Don't forget, the day will come when you will have to face Razinin.
BULJANOFF: Good old Razinin! Is he still alive? How does he manage?
NINOTCHKA: But, Comrades...
KOPALSKI: We are not comrades any more... we are friends, Ninotchka.
BULJANOFF: Imagine, we don't have to whisper any longer.
IRANOFF: We can say whatever we want. We can shout... we can complain... Look... The service in this hotel is terrible! See? Nobody comes... nobody pays any attention. That's freedom.
BULJANOFF: No, that's bad management.
NINOTCHKA: Is it possible to bring you back to reality for a moment? I must have a complete report of your negotiations and a detailed expense account.
BULJANOFF: Don't ask for it, Ninotchka. There is a Turkish proverb which says, If something smells bad
NINOTCHKA: And there is a Russian saying: The cat who has cream on his whiskers had better find good excuses.""
BULJANOFF: With our cream situation what it is, it is Russia which should apologize to the cats.
NINOTCHKA: Friends... friends, Buljanoff, Iranoff...
KOPALSKI: ...and Kopalski.
NINOTCHKA: Don't make it difficult for me. This is no more a pleasure trip for me than it is for you.
IRANOFF: That was our idea when we first came. All we thought we would get out of this trip was a Turkish bath, but... we learned better.
KOPALSKI: Ninotchka, we are in the magic East, the country of Aladdin and His Lamp...
IRANOFF: ...Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves... into one single hour you can crowd a thousand and one nights.
BULJANOFF: All you have to do is say open sesame.""
NINOTCHKA: I don't know how I can get you out of it this time. How will it end? What will happen to you?
BULJANOFF: Shall we tell her?
