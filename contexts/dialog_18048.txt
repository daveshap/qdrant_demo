ANNIE: Yes, Paul.
PAUL: I'm almost done.
ANNIE: Oh, Paul, this is so romantic. Ian and Windthorne dueling for the right to Misery's hand. Does Ian win? Oh, don't me. It's Windthorne, right?
PAUL: You'll know everything in a minute. Get the champagne.
ANNIE: Ahh!!!
ANNIE: Did I do good?
PAUL: You did perfect. Except for one thing. This time we need two glasses.
