DUFF: How come you stay 'round here?
JOSIE: Well, my mother was the only good teacher the colored school ever had. Nobody bothers with those kids.
DUFF: That's why you come back, huh?
JOSIE: It's hard to see any change. But I'm going to stay. Another year, anyway.
DUFF: You got more guts than me, baby. It's a no-good town.
JOSIE: It's better than it used to be. Eight years ago they still had a lynching here. They tied a man to a car and dragged him to death. My father knew who did it, but he didn't say anything.
DUFF: Scared, huh?
