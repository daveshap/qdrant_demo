POOLE: Dave, if you've a minute, I'd like your advice on something.
BOWMAN: Sure, what is it?
POOLE: Well, it's nothing really important, but it's annoying.
BOWMAN: What's up?
POOLE: It's about my salary cheques.
BOWMAN: Yes?
POOLE: Well I got the papers on my official up-grading to AGS-19 two weeks before we left.
C12: CONTINUED
BOWMAN: Yes, I remember you mentioning it. I got mine about the same time.
POOLE: That's right. Well, naturally, I didn't say anything to Payroll. I assumed they'd start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque. But it's been almost three weeks now and I'm still being paid as an AGS-18.
BOWMAN: Interesting that you mention it, because I've got the same problem.
POOLE: Really.
BOWMAN: Yes.
POOLE: Yesterday, I finally called the Accounting Office at Mission Control, and all they could tell me was that they'd received the AGS-19 notification for the other three but not mine, and apparently not yours either.
C12: CONTINUED
BOWMAN: Did they have any explanation for this?
POOLE: Not really. They just said it might be because we trained at Houston and they trained in Marshall, and that we're being charged against differ- ent accounting offices.
BOWMAN: It's possible.
POOLE: Well, what do you think we ought to do about it?
BOWMAN: I don't think we should make any fuss about it yet. I'm sure they'll straighten it out.
POOLE: I must say, I never did understand why they split us into two groups for training.
BOWMAN: No. I never did, either.
