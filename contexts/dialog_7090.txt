BLONDE: Who are you?
MAX: Bruno's girlfriend.
BLONDE: Oh, yeah?
MAX: Yeah.
BLONDE: But see tonight wives and girlfriends aren't invited.
MAX: No?
BLONDE: No... Cause tonight the girls are here in a more or less professional capacity. All of them work for me, and you don't... Let's go.
MAX: Okay, okay. I can explain... You ever have to do something you really don't want to?
BLONDE: How I make my living, what's your point?
MAX: This.
