NED: I was only checkin' it for you. Thought maybe somethin' was bent.
THE KID: Nothin's bent.
NED: Well, you was shootin' every which way an'...
THE KID: You gonna share your half with him?
MUNNY: Three ways, I figured.
THE KID: No.
MUNNY: Sorry, Ned. Guess I wasted your time. See ya, Kid!
THE KID: You're goin' back with him?
MUNNY: He's my partner. He don't go, I don't.
