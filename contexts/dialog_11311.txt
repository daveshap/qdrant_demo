KAREN: Jimmy's calling every day. It's urgent.
HENRY: What did he say, exactly?
KAREN: At least Jimmy and Mickey want to help. I talk to Mickey every day. That's more than I can say for the rest.
HENRY: Paul will calm down. You'll see.
KAREN: I told Jimmy the cops took our cars and froze our bank accounts and he offered to get me some money. Be wants to know what's happening. You gotta meet him.
HENRY: Fuck Jimmy and the money. Didn't I tell you I gotta get out of here first. I gotta straighten every- thing out with Paulie or I'm dead.
KAREN: Then you're safer in here.
HENRY: Safe? Here? They'll kill me here. They're all afraid I'm gonna rat them out. People are already looking to walk away from me. I'm dead in here. You gotta get me out.
KAREN: Who's gonna do that?
HENRY: Just get me out.
