I'm tired of all these people complaining about posters who are just stressing out
I get that a lot of people with high scores and GPA asking if they will get into decent schools can be frustrating. I get it. Its annoying.

But at the same time, these people are just stressed out. They've worked their butts off all of high school and they are getting last minute jitters. They just want to vent. Let them. If it pisses you off that much then dont upvote them. Or better yet, downvote them. But dont post the same post that everyone is posting about those people being annoying. This subreddit is for advice about college admissions and, just as importantly, for student who are scared or nervous about their futures. Let's support each other. No reason to needlessly hate :)
