I don’t want to feel depressed anymore
I’ve been depressed for 8 years now, and long story short it’s really been getting the best of me these past 3 months. I don’t know why it’s all crashing down now. I’m tired of feeling like this, I say I want to die but in reality I just want to escape. I finally want to be better. I just don’t know how. Therapy doesn’t seem to help, and I’m willing to try anything to feel better. Every time I get to a good place mentally, something happens and I’m back to square one. I’m a mess I guess and just need help to get beyond this
