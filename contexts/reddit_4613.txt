I’ve lost all hope.
A switch was flipped. I blinked. I blinked, and everything I’ve worked towards improving my mental health was just snapped away like that.

I hate being the 5 billionth person to be complaining about the pandemic. But I need to get it off my chest. I wish this could all be over. Everything’s getting worse and worse. I’m not exactly doing great mental healthy wise, especially seeing how I haven’t seen my friends for 23 days now. Yes, I’ve been counting. And I don’t know why. All I know is that I might not make it. Online school has been stressing me out beyond belief. The work load has just tripled and I’m constantly rushing to get shit done. We’re running out of food, with little way to get more. My mom can’t go to work because she got infected. She won’t see another paycheck for god knows how long. I can’t go find work because everything’s closed, and I too got infected. The money I have now won’t be enough.

All I can do now is lock myself in my room. Doing endless amounts of homework and waiting for the virus to kill me. Because it might. I have asthma. It hasn’t gotten to that point yet but.... at this point I want it to kill me. I don’t know when this will all be over, and I’m losing everything. I’m close to losing my friends. I keep lashing out against the people I care about and I don’t know how to stop.

It’s becoming a problem. I haven’t been able to physically interact with another person in weeks. I’m desperate for any human touch at this point. I think it’s making me more horny.... which is becoming a serious problem.

I wish my mental health wouldn’t crash down like this man. But it did, and there’s nothing I can do about it. I don’t know if I’m outright suicidal. Maybe borderline. Again, I wouldn’t mind if it took me. No one would care anyway. My boyfriend will find someone new, someone better than him. My friends will move on. It would be fine. If the virus is going to ruin my life, then it might as well take it at this point.
