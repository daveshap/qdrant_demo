ROB: Laura...
LAURA: I'm too tired not to go out with you.
ROB: So if you had a bit more energy we'd stay split. But things being how they are, what with you wiped out, you'd like us to get back together.
LAURA: Everything's too hard. Maybe another time I would have the guts to be on my own, but not now I don't.
ROB: What about Ian?
LAURA: Ray's a disaster. I don't know what that was all about, except that sometimes you need someone to lob into the middle of a bad relationship like a hand grenade, I guess, and blow it all apart.
ROB: Mission accomplished.
LAURA: I know it's not very romantic, but there will be romance again at some stage, I'm sure. I just... I need you, Rob. That's it. And we know each other and we care for each other, and you've made it clear that you want me back, so...
LAURA: Let's go home. Okay?
ROB: Okay.
