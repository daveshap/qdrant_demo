Reputation fix
So Freshman year I messed up really bad I got into a lot of fights and a lot of people hate me and think I’m annoying and my own teammates don’t really like me anymore on football, wrestling, or volleyball. Everyone thinks I’m annoying or just don’t talk to me. I don’t really have a friend group cause the friends I do have all play different sports than each other so I just end up hanging out with people individually. How do I fix my reputation Sophmore year and how do I make a friend group? Or do I just transfer to a different school?
