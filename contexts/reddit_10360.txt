Anyone else badly want a relationship but know it’s a terrible idea
How could having a relationship be a good idea when most of us on this thread are probably really unstable, some getting their thoughts out, some contemplating ending it, some already having decided and making their last remarks.

I don’t think life has a meaning but I do think love is the closest thing that means the slightest to me. The only times in the last 3 years I see shimmer of light is when a potential romantic interest arises. The feelings are different to those of friends of family for me. Selfish to want it or engage when you sleep for 16 hours some days, don’t respond to meds and are very unstable. One day having made plans to end your life, the nest cancelling them. Being paralysed in bed another day. All those sorts of things make relationships unattainable and daunting for people like us.

So unfair and angering. Everyone deserves love, especially those who are suffering and suicidal. I feel we deserve it the most but we can’t feel it like other people because our mind is torturing us and convincing us we don’t deserve it. I’ve turned down girls for poor and unresponsive multiple mental illnesses. Will continue to do so until my health is stable which is as likely as me winning the lottery. Heartbreaking
