Correlation between a continous and integer variable I would like to calculate the correlation between two variables. The first variable is continous and represents a performance measure. The second variable is an integer in the range from one to nine and represents an emotional rating of a user.Currently, I'm using Spearmen correlation because neither the the first nor the second variable is normally distributed.Is this correct? Or what correlation measure should be used for an integer variable?
