Has the war on drugs by President of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, been effective in combating drug use and related crimes? What have been the secondary effects of this drug war?
I remember seeing this article towards the end of 2016 about the [beginnings of Duterte's war on drugs.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/12/07/world/asia/rodrigo-duterte-philippines-drugs-killings.html)

More recently, I tend to see quotes by him that highlight how he's an eccentric, but pretty little about what's going on in the Philippines.

After 2 years in office, [~5000 suspected drug dealers and users have been killed](https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/12/03/world/asia/03reuters-philippines-duterte.html). What have been the effects of this, both as they relate to the original mission and unforeseen secondary effects?
