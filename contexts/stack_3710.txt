t-test/chi squarred test or mcnemar test? To what extent does the effect of presence of music differ for the concentration ability in playing a memory recall game in males and females?So basically I had 50 students (25 females and 25 males) take the test in silence and the next day with music. I'd like to perform some statistical test to see if the variables are independent, for example if the number of correct answers given by the students depends on whether there is music present or not.And also if there is difference between males and females on this regard. Hence, these two things need to be tested. So I would love to have some suggestions on this, a t-test/chi squared test/ McNemar test are the ones I am thinking about, but I'm really not sure which one will be more appropriate.
