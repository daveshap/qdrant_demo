iPod Classic can't be seen by iTunes 12.7 on Windows 10 I have a used iPod Classic 5th Generation (A1136) that was purchased for a parent as it is compatible with all their 40-pin gear. One of the parents already has an identical model which was \"working fine\" (although hadn't been synced for over a year). By this I understand that syncing has worked on their family PC (running Windows 10) in the past, but updates may have been run / fiddling may have taken place since the last successful sync.However, I plugged in this newly purchased iPod to the family PC (via USB) and strange things began to happen. The iPod appeared to connect, then disconnect and reconnect again in a loop until eventually Windows gave up and said the device had malfunctioned. iTunes doesn't detect the device at all, but once the connect/reconnect loop gives up the iPod appears as a mass storage device - but iTunes continues to ignore it.Things I have trieddifferent computer - tried it on another Windows 10 machine with an identical version of iTunes (12.7.4.76) - works flawlessly (with the same sync cable)different USB port on the same computer - all behave identicallyuninstall iTunes, reboot, reinstall iTunes, reboot - same behaviourreinstall Apple Mobile Device Support driver (usbaapl64.inf) - same behaviourHonestly, I'm tearing my hair out. Short of a clean Windows 10 install I don't know what else to do. Any ideas?
