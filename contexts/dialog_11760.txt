TOM: Can you drive?
GRACE: Drive? I'm not old enough yet.
TOM: It's never too soon to start.
GRACE: I can't...
TOM: I don't have all day.
TOM: Put the key in and turn it. The right pedal is gas, the other one's the brake.
GRACE: I don't know if I can with my leg.
TOM: Well, there's only one way to find out. Give it a little gas.
