Style MapServer layers easily (or as easy as possible) I am working with MapServer WMS in the form of mapfiles and consuming them into a OpenLayers map.I am trying to find out a way to ease the symbolization process of the various layers in a mapfile.I have not started diving into the STYLE directive yet, but before I do that I'd like to know whether there's an easy way to (let's say) preview the style of my layers (an application?) and export it into a (e.g.) SLD which the MapServer can read.I don't know if this is the best (or feasible) way to go about styling mapfile's layers, but I am open to any kind of suggestion.
