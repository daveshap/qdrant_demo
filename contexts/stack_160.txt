Can a foreigner make a purchase in App Store China? I want to make an IAP on my Chinese App Store account. I live in China so all the other information including mobile phone and valid address is not a problem. So I can create an account and download apps. But when I try to make a purchase, I hit the wall as there seems no way to finish the payment.Both WeChat and Alipay don\u2019t accept the foreigners account. The credit card is acceptable but only cards issued in China are acceptable, which I can\u2019t have. Also the bank transfer is not acceptable as it requires to type in a valid Chinese citizen number, which I cannot fill in using my passport number.So I wonder there is a way to make a purchase in Chinese App Store as a foreigner.
