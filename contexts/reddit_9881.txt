Wrong date to file for request
Hello people of this sub,

I wanted to ask if anybody has experience with near academic dropout.

I try to make this comprehensible and short as possible

I am almost at the end of my studies (bachelor thesis already graded, practical workload of internships etc. finished, all exams but 3 done)

Due to my depression I had to put my studies on slow, and until now I have worked off this mountain of exams; until my remaining 3 plus 1 more (results pending but it went well) 

We have a credit system which requires you to pass exams worth 30 credits each semester, to stay immatriculated. I had only left 3 exams for this semester (wintersemester) of each 9 credits and 4 courses in the summer semester with the remaining credits before i finish.

I did well on my last exams and even pulled up another course from the summer, so i could maybe get over the 30, but i dont know how i did on that one.

I have medical documentation that i can submit together with a written statement why i would like to continue studying, despite not hitting the 30, but I wrote down the wrong date for the submission; the professors of my field have convient 2 days ago.

I will still file my papers, with an additional note, that I made the mistake with the date, but I know they can reject me.

Has anybody got experience with a case like this? 

I am ok if I will be expelled. It would just suck, because I worked my way out of depression and now this.
