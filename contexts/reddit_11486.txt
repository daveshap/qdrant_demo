I have to put my dog down...
Cocoa.  Named by my then six-year old son after the breakfast cereal that was sitting on the kitchen counter.  Cocoa is 14 years old.  We got him from the pound just before his second birthday.  He's been a great dog. Like most dogs, he's considered a member of the family.  Time has taken its toll.  He 100% deaf.  His eyes are cloudy with glacoma.  He is forgetful and suffers a bit of dementia.  His quality of life is rapidly diminishing.  Yet why do I feel like a murderer?  Every time I set a date, he snaps back into focus for a week, and then slowly slips down the ladder.  When is the right time?  When is the right moment?  I'm frustrated, upset, and confused.  I'm left to wonder what's the right choice and when???
