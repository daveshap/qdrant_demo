Length of a cubit in Ted Chiang's Tower of Babylon My question is about the length of the cubit in Ted Chiang's \"Tower of Babylon\" story. The ancient cubit was, give or take, 20 inches.  In his \"Tower of Babylon,\" Ted Chiang describes the tower's platform as 200 cubits on a side, and the tower itself as 60 cubits on a side.  This works out to a tower that is 100 feet on a side.  Considering that the widest side of the Empire State Building is 420 feet, that doesn't sound like a particularly massive tower.  (The tower was incredibly tall, yes, but it's base was very small.)Am I missing something? Is there some other definition in play?  A number of commentaries seem to assume that it was a giant tower at the base, but the book's definitions don't suggest that...
