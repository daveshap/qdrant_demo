JODY: I am.
LEONARD: My house is just a couple of blocks away. Why don't you come on over and clean those cuts up.
JODY: Ok. Should I put my bike in the back of your car?
LEONARD: Can you just follow me? The back is full?
JODY: Sure.
LEONARD: You aren't going to the party?
JODY: You know about that too?
LEONARD: of COURSE. You're not scared?
JODY: Of course I'm scared.
LEONARD: Then you should go.
JODY: You think I should go to the party, Mr. Marliston?
LEONARD: I really do. For your own safety.
