Working in SA/HE as an international student in the US?
How likely are international students getting sponsored to work in SA?

I just graduated in May and had decided to never to go back to school again. But, things changed, and I felt my passion to help low-income students through education grow stronger recently as I thought about my future.

I'm thinking of going back to school to get a master's (in SA/HE/EdLeadership), but I'm not sure of my prospect of getting a job in US colleges later as an international student. I got a bachelor's in liberal arts with no internship experience and have experienced the difficulty of getting a job of my interest already, so I don't want to experience the same thing again. .. I want to make sure that now I'm making informed decisions...

Being a low-income first generation without much support in term of career path in college makes me want to help first-gens even more but the reality is that if this is not a right decision, I would be a step backward and am already in crippling student debt
