How do I log out in chromium? How do I log out of the Google account in Chromium.After trying out the Google hangouts extension (which I have now uninstalled) I have my name displayed in the upper right side of Chromium windows, which means that I am logged into the Google account in some manner. I wish to log out.When I press 'Manage people', I don't see any logout option. I do see a way to open another window as a guest, but that's not what I'm looking for. I want to logout of all the current windows and to no longer have my google account associated with the Chromium installation.
