MIKE: Hey, what's goin' on, little brother!
SEAN: Damn! You sonuvabitch! Look at you!
MIKE: Look great, don't I?
SEAN: Got a job for me?
MIKE: Yeah, we'll find something for you. Shoveling shark shit or something.
SEAN: Sharks???
MIKE: In a restaurant. You sit there and they swim around you.
SEAN: ... I'll go to McDonalds.
MIKE: How'd you do in school?
SEAN: Great. I got one B, two C's, and eight incompletes.
MIKE: Hey, I'm proud of you, kid.
SEAN: So was Dad.
SEAN: Took it this morning.
MIKE: He needs a haircut.
SEAN: Yeah, right.
MIKE: How is he? Still fighting crime?
SEAN: Last week he broke up a major counterfeiting ring. Gang of kids were using slugs in the Pac-Man games.
MIKE: Big bust! He confiscate their water pistols?
SEAN: Booked them all at Baskin- Robbins.
MIKE: That's Dad...
MIKE: He taught us good, though, didn't he, Sean? We were lucky to grow up the way we did.
SEAN: Who's grown up?
MIKE: Gee, it's good to see you!
SEAN: I want to see Kathryn.
MIKE: Just find your own. Like Dad says, there's plenty of fish in the sea.
