How trustworthy is CyberCoders?
I'm going to be graduating college in May and I've started looking for full time jobs in the Web Development field. I've been searching around and have my fair share of staffing companies and recruiting companies contact me via linked in. I stumbled upon CyberCoders and was wondering what their deal was? Do they get a portion of my first year's pay check? How do companies like CyberCoders work? Are they trustworthy? Do they try and find you A job or THE RIGHT job?
