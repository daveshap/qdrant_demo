Food systems?
Hi! Prospective grad student here. Just received a B.S. in Environmental Science and currently working on a 60 acre organic farm outside of Chicago. Looking for some information/inspiration/ideas. 

Is anyone here doing agricultural or food systems related research? If so, what are you researching? Do you have any advice for someone looking to pursue higher ed in food systems? Iâ€™m interested in agroecology, community resiliency, food justice, and sustainable food systems in general and would like to hear what others are working on. Share your story with me!
