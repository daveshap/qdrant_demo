GASTON: Goodbye...
MARIETTE: Goodbye.
GASTON: It could have been marvelous ...
MARIETTE: Divine ...
GASTON: Wonderful ... But tomorrow morning, if you should wake out of your dreams and hear a knock, and the door opens, and there, instead of a maid with a breakfast tray, stands a policeman with a warrant--then you'll be glad you're alone.
MARIETTE: But it could have been glorious.
GASTON: Lovely.
MARIETTE: Divine ... But that terrible policeman!
GASTON: Goodbye ...
