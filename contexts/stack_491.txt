Using Ubuntu as an SMTP server for Gmail Can anyone point me to a guide for using Postfix (or similar) to send email as an SMTP server for Gmail. I've had a solid search and come up empty handed.I have multiple domains and all the email terminates in Gmail, but Google changed their policy a while back to stop letting users send email from multiple domains - now they insist you have your own SMTP server. I have a Ubuntu VPS I use for web hosting, is there any reason I couldn't use it as an SMTP server for Gmail?
