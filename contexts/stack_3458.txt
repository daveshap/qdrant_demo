How to Remotely Retrieve Password Hash from Computer Just for fun, I wanted to see if I could remotely extract the password hash of my own user account on my own Mac.Assume that the device is running either the latest version of macOS Sierra (10.12.6) or High Sierra (10.13.3). Also, assume that the computer has remote management and SSH enabled. The only catch is that SSH is set to not allow any user to authenticate.Knowing this, is there any way that I could remotely grab the password hash of my local account to attempt to crack it on another PC?
