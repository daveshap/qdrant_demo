So I’ve been working on my Masters for close to 3 years. The experiments took FOREVER, not to mention writing the thesis! However, my defense is finally in two weeks!!! YESSS. Has anyone else’s Masters taken as long as mine?
I’ve been doing a Bachelor’s/Masters contiguous program for the past 3 years, and I’m finally nearing the finish line. A combination of laborious work, med school apps, procrastination and very hard “senioritis” made this drag on longer than it should have. Has anyone else had a Masters program that just draaaagged on? I always felt I was doing something wrong by taking so long to complete it. People around me always seemed to graduate within 2 years. For a while, it felt I was never going to actually get the degree. My defense will feel surreal...

Edit: Thank you all for such reassuring comments! It definitely makes me feel alot better :)
