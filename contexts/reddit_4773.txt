Has anybody ever felt like that?
Hi everyone,

I don't know if this is the right sub for this and if not, i'm deeply  sorry because i know there are people here who are in pain and need your help more than i do.

Let's tell you a bit about me for the matter at hands: for as long as i can remember, i've been a books guy, when other kids would go play together during school breaks i would just go sit somewhere and read. My father is a history fan, especially WW2 and i grew up hearing stories about soldiers, visiting museums in normandy and watching war movies.

Today i'm 23, married, two dogs and i just finished a series of intensive web developpment courses. The next step is finding an internship and getting a job as webdev.

But...

I feel like everything's pointless, i spent my life reading about people doing things that matters and now im supposed to just get a job so i can spend hours doing something that i don't like that much (still the professionnal activity i like the most of all the ones i tried so far) just so i can make it to the next month? Is that really all there is to life?Am I to just waste my entire time working and try not to get bored the rest of the time?

So i guess what i'm asking is: has anybody here found the answer to that question?

PS: sorry if that doesn't make sense, i can only put words on it when i'm drunk so it doesn't always make sense.
