DANTE: I don't know. He just came in and asked to use the bathroom.
CORONER: What time was this?
DANTE: Um... I don't know. What time did hockey end?
RANDAL: Around three or something.
DANTE: What time did we go to the funeral?
RANDAL: I think four.
CORONER: Wait a second? Who was working here today?
DANTE: Just me.
CORONER: I thought you just said you played hockey and went to a funeral.
DANTE: We did.
CORONER: Then who operated the store?
DANTE: Nobody. It was closed.
CORONER: With this guy locked in?
DANTE: Everything happened at once. I guess I forgot he was back there.
