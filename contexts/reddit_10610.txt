I think my heart might explode or just stop working from excessive self inflicted heartbreak
I just....ruin everything. I don’t know how to function. It feels like all of the air in my body is rushing towards my heart and pressing on it and it’s going to burst at any moment and my chest hurts and I want so badly to just dissolve into earth. Why! Why can’t the world just open and swallow me whole! 

I’m the type of person who invades your life and leaves nothing but destruction. I can’t make this work. I think I deserve to feel this pain sometimes, I just wish I could take pain I cause other people away from them and carry that. 

I hate myself.
