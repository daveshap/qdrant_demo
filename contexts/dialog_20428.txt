RIPLEY: Foley? That you?
FOLEY: How are you, Richard?
RIPLEY: Jesus Christ, what the hell are you doing here? What's going on? Who's upstairs?
FOLEY: Maurice Miller, couple of his friends.
RIPLEY: Maurice? From Lompoc? Good God.
RIPLEY: Have they got Midge up there?
FOLEY: What kinda man lets a woman answer the door, this time a night?
RIPLEY: We thought it might be her husband. Sometimes he comes and checks up on her. She told him I was down in Florida.
FOLEY: A minute or two, you're gonna wish you were.
