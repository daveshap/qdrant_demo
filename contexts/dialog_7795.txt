HARRY: Oh hey Lloyd, why are you here?
LLOYD: Just wanted to see how your doing.
HARRY: I kinda screwed things up.
LLOYD: I'm sure you're overreacting.
HARRY: I don't think so.
LLOYD: You're always your harshest critic.
HARRY: She wants me to stay for dinner, I don't know what to say to her.
LLOYD: Okay, I saw this in a movie once. Open the dining room window and follow my lead. Say what I say.
HARRY: Good - thanks Lloyd! I'll meet you downstairs, I gotta find some clothes.
JESSICA: What are you wearing?
HARRY: I, uh... changed for dinner. I get dressed for all my meals. Except breakfast and bath-meal. Boy, it's hot in here. Mind if I open a window?
LLOYD: HARRY, can you hear me?
HARRY: Yes.
JESSICA: Yes, what?
LLOYD: Don't answer me. Say what I say.
HARRY: Okay.
JESSICA: Okay, what?
LLOYD: You have beautiful eyes.
HARRY: You have beautiful eyes.
