Ive developed a crush on a girl I only talked to for an hour or so at a party. Getting her number would be weird but i want to so badly
I went to a friends party and hung out with a few girls in the front room for a bit. her and i got to talking, were both in the same grade, shes beautiful, shes down to earth and just fun. we put on the lone rider and watched it a bit, she was somewhat drunk and i was on lsd which kinda obscured my judgement. anyway, after a bit she and her friends had to go home, i didnt get a goodbye or a number or anything. we have a mutual friend( the host) and im considering if i should ask him to ask her if shed like to text me or if thatd be weird. i feel absolutely infatuated, she is completely my type. we got along pretty well but it didnt get too deep, just a pleasant conversatiom and im not that attractive so thats what worries me.
