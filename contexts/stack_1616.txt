How many amps does a 18v cordless drill draw? I have bought an old 18v black and decker cordless drill but with broken batteries, for that, I want to buy a boost converter to convert 12v (max 20A ) from a computer power supply to 18v and use this drill as corded drill, but I need to know, how many amps does an 18v cordless drill draw to choose which boost converter to buy 200w 300w 400w ?
