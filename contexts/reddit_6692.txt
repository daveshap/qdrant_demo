Question regarding pharm sales transferring to med sales career?
I spoke to a hiring agent of a med sales job. He’s a Vice President at a med sales company and I asked him a few questions with some career advice for someone getting started into med sales.

He told me that med sales recruiters tend to avoid prior pharmaceutical sales reps when they’re thumbing through applications for a med sales rep job. He said seeing them have pharmaceutical sales experience makes med sales reps more reluctant to hiring them because they feel like they’ve had their career “handed to them” since pharmaceutical sales tend to have a higher guaranteed base salary. 

To me this sounds a bit discriminatory and i don’t want to ruin my chances getting a med sales job because I have pharmaceutical sales experience.

Is this true? Would this be discrimination?
