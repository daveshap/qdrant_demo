Variable voltage switching 12vdc I am looking for a circuit that would be switching a relay coil and few small leds (max 3A) with a low voltage input. Now the input is variable voltage 1.1v to 5v produced by a hall sensor pot. I want the circuit to be switched on when my input reaches 1.2 or 1.3v to switch a relay with 12vdc. Also the 1.1v to 5v values can not be affected by this additional circuit. Any help greatly appreciated .
