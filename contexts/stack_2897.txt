On Harmonics In Physics I am an IB physics student. I am very confused about the concept of first, second, third, etc harmonics. My questions are: How does a wave get from first to second harmonic, and from second harmonic to third harmonic etc? What do we need to do to a wave to get it there? Increase the speed, frequency, wavelength, etc? Let's take a free ended rope being oscillated at second harmony. Compared to the fundamental wave, the frequency of the wave now is two times higher, and the wavelength is two times less than the fundamental wave. Does this mean that at second harmony, the speed of the wave increases? Can you please try to explain this simply, at the level of a someone who still hasn't learnt Calculus based physics? Thanks.
