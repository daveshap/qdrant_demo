How do I motivate myself to start reading again?
Hi! So this has been an issue I’ve been struggling with for a few years now, but I have a really hard time reading and completing books. It’s annoying because it’s like my “soul” really wants to read more, like how I used to, but obviously depression is a big roadblock to that. I always find myself turning on the TV instead even when I know reading would make me feel better. Anyways, I was just wondering if anyone had any advice with trying to get myself into the headspace to pick up a book more often instead of throwing on the TV.
