SLOAN: What is your problem?
DELACROIX: My problem is MANTAN THE NEW MILLENIUM MINSTREL SHOW.
SLOAN: Why did you even come up with that shit if you didn't want it made?
DELACROIX: It was the principle. Dunwitty had to be enlightened. I was making a point. I take pride in my work. Plus, I already told you I wasn't gonna walk away from my money.
SLOAN: Fuck da money. Why do through all this effort? Why? Are you looking for love from Dunwitty? For respect? Dunwitty and his likes don't give a goddamn about you. So now what are you gonna do?
