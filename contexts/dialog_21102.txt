STEW: Wait a minute. Do I get from you that she wants to pay me alimony?
GRAYSON: That's putting it crudely, but—
STEW: Remember what I told you about that twentieth crack? All right, you've just made it. Before you go unconscious I want you to get this through your nut.
GRAYSON: I beg your pardon.
STEW: Unconscious. You know, when you don't know anything. Your natural state. There are some people - you can't buy their self-respect for a bucket of shekels - well, I happen to be one of those guys.
GRAYSON: We just thought that—
STEW: Don't think. Let me do all the thinking. Now you go back to that Schuyler outfit and tell them that I didn't marry that dame for her dough and I don't want any of her dough now. I was too poor to buy her a wedding present when we got married, so I'm giving her a divorce for a wedding present. Now, stand up!
GRAYSON: Yes.
STEW: And now for that twentieth crack—
GALLAGHER: Who was that?
STEW: Grayson - Anne's lawyer.
GALLAGHER: What did he want?
STEW: Gallagher, that guy just dropped by to give us a great opening for the third act.
