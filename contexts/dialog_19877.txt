WILLIAM: What did she say?
SPIKE: Well, it was genuinely bizarre... she said, hi -- it's Anna -- and then she said, call me at the Ritz -- and then gave herself a completely different name.
WILLIAM: Which was?
SPIKE: Absolutely no idea. Remembering one name's bad enough...
WILLIAM: Hello.
RITZ MAN: May I help you, sir?
WILLIAM: Ahm, look this is a very odd situation. I'm a friend of Anna Scott's -- and she rang me at home the day before yesterday -- and left a message saying she's staying with you...
RITZ MAN: I'm sorry, we don't have anyone of that name here, sir.
WILLIAM: No, that's right -- I know that. She said she's using another name -- but the problem is she left the message with my flatmate, which was a serious mistake.
RITZ MAN: Yes, sir. I have him in my mind.
WILLIAM: And then double it -- and that is the -- what can I say -- git I'm living with and he cannot remember...
SPIKE: Try 'Flintstone.'
WILLIAM: What?
SPIKE: I think she said her name was 'Flintstone.'
WILLIAM: Does 'Flintstone' mean anything to you?
