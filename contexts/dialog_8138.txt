REYNOLDS: Have we met before?
JACK: Yeah.
REYNOLDS: Was it a party?
JACK: Something like that.
REYNOLDS: Oh, I know. A Fleur-de-Lis party, right?
JACK: Fleaur-de-Lis. 'Whatever you desire.'
REYNOLDS: Dope, liquor, hookers that look like movie stars. Pierce Patchett has it all.
JACK: Yeah. Me and Patchett go way back.
REYNOLDS: Pierce isn't like regular people. I dig him, but he scares me too.
JACK: Really? How?
REYNOLDS: You know, when I came out to L.A., this isn't exactly where I saw myself ending up.
JACK: Yeah. Me neither.
