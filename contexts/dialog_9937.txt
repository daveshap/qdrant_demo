WALDMAN: Electricity.
VICTOR: It's utterly fantastic! This is the sort of thing I'm talking about! We should be learning this!
WALDMAN: Why? God alone knows what it means. Until it has proven value, it's nothing more than a ghoulish parlor trick. Hardly fit for the classroom.
VICTOR: But the possibilities. Combining ancient knowledge with new? Something like this could change our fundamental views!
WALDMAN: It is a thrilling direction to explore. Thrilling and dangerous. Nature can be wonderful and terrible. Science is not a realm for the reckless; it needs a conscience. We must proceed cautiously. Assess as we go. What I do on my own time is my own business. The same holds true for you. You wish to expand your mind? Fine, do so. You can even join me here, if you like. But not at the expense of your normal studies.
VICTOR: I doubt that decision is still mine to make.
WALDMAN: Nonsense. Tonight you will draft an apology to Professor Krempe...
WALDMAN: ...a sincere and heartfelt apology which you will then read aloud to him before the assembled student body and faculty."
VICTOR: Why?
WALDMAN: Our profession needs talent like yours. Destroy your career over an issue of pride? What a waste.
