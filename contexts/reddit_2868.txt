Job is destroying my mental health, but my current job search is not proving effective. Should I quit without a job lined up?
Going to try to keep this short but I'm in need of advice: 

- About 7 months ago I got promoted to a permanent position in the nonprofit where I work (my first permanent job after uni)
- My boss said she knew this isn't where I want to be but wants to help me get there one day (I've worked for her on/off for a few years)
- I planned to stay for 1-2 years as a building block to where I really want to be 
- However, I'm so anxious and depressed on the job that I've had breakdowns and contemplated suicide many times since October
- Every day from when I wake up to when I go home from work, I feel so anxious that I feel physically sick
- The dread grows every night and I put off sleep because I know I'll have to wake up and go back
- I can't stop worrying about work even when I'm not at work
- The vibe is so negative at the office with bosses always insulting our partner organizations behind their back and talking about how terrible they are which in a nonprofit really bothers me and creates this negative energy that I absorb
- I was told to work more independently but despite my efforts to do that, my bosses are micromanaging and complain a lot 
- Job search is going poorly, no calls back yet 
- I'm seeing a counsellor but can only do so every 3-4 weeks because bosses are very reluctant to give time off 
- I've overheard bosses talking about me and it makes me extremely paranoid 
- Intrusive anxious and negative thoughts and increasing frequency of suicidal thoughts 
- Told myself I'd resign in January if I still felt this terrible but I'm so scared  

So... should I quit with nothing lined up? 
- My bosses take things very personally when someone leaves

- My boss has hired me in numerous contract jobs for a few years now; I'm worried she will be mad if I quit after less than a year / that I'll lose her as a reference

- Job market is tough, worried I won't find a new one

BUT

- Work is so emotionally exhausting that I have no energy to put toward fuelling my job search, and can't get time off unless it's 2 weeks in advance (e.g. for interviews) 

- I've been at this orgo for 1.5 years now (plus used to work there part time on top of the 1.5yrs) 

- I feel unable to function properly and my performance is somewhat poor because I feel so mentally unwell

- Frequent nightmares about work and physical anxiety symptoms

- Trying hard with meditation, breathing, reworking thoughts but it's not proving very successful 

- I'm miserable every day and it affects everyone around me because I'm having difficulty being present in the moment 

- I live with my parents and have very few expenses 

- Everyone I've worked for in the past has been very happy with me, there are probably other people I could use as references in worst case scenario 

- I have a few options of what I could do next, all of which are closer to my dreams/career goals 

Ultimately I feel like my body and mind are screaming out for a change but I'm so scared of the consequences and potentially ruining my career trajectory that I'm paralyzed. I have felt miserable since July so any insights anyone has would really help me - what should I do?
