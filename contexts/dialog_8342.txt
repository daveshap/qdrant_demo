QUI: A true master. Classic, yet extremely sexual, don't you think?
GIN: We need to make the trade tomorrow.
QUI: Always in a rush.
GIN: You should know, when I come back here with the Mask--if anything goes wrong, a detailed description of everything you've done goes to the PRC.
QUI: Gin, really.
GIN: Tomorrow. It has to be tomorrow. Or forget the Mask.
THIBADEAUX: Tonight your league night?
MAC: Check out my ball.
THIBADEAUX: Doesn't look like much. How come those Commos want it so bad?
MAC: It's not just art, it's history. Something you Americans don't care about--because you haven't got any.
THIBADEAUX: That's because we live in the future. Which is what's on my mind.
MAC: This is just show and tell.
THIBADEAUX: I'm waiting for the tell part.
MAC: She's calling the shots now.
THIBADEAUX: You're impressed with her, aren't you?
MAC: She's good. Give her that. Almost as good as she thinks she is.
THIBADEAUX: She reminds you of yourself. There's nobody you admire more.
THIBADEAUX: My antenna is up, it is fully extended, and I am picking up...what is it? It is, can it be? The boy is in el, u, v.
MAC: It's never happened before. What makes you think it's happening now?
THIBADEAUX: You better be keeping your mind on business. It's not just me you got to worry about. I've got some very unpleasant folks looking over my shoulder.
MAC: You know where my loyalties lie.
THIBADEAUX: To yourself, that's where.
MAC: You'll just have to have faith.
THIBADEAUX: Faith is angels dancing on the head of a pin. I got to have trust.
MAC: She won't tell me everything. It's a bank job, that's all I know.
