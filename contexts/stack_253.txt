Hide Everything For Cmd+Space Spotlight Search but Applications I am trying to use Spotlight as a way to solely launch my most used applications.A lot of them have similar names, so for me Spotlight displaying in a linear down list works much better then lets say Launchpad which displays them in something like a column/row combination.Anyways I am trying to both speed up Spotlight and prevent it from displaying false positives by hiding everything but applications.I did this by effectively unchecking everything but Applications in System Preferences \u2192 Spotlight \u2192 Search Results, and then by preventing indexing of my home folder directly.The problem is now I can't search my Mac for anything. This solved 1 issue while creating another.Is there a way to feasible make Spotlight search only applications while everything else search globally?
