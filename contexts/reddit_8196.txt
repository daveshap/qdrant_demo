Congress will no longer prevent a deal the Trump administration made with Chinese tech firm ZTE. What specific changes occurred to shift Congressional support of deal?
Republicans [dropped their bid to block a deal](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/senate-republicans-cave-to-trump-on-deal-with-chinese-telecom-giant-zte/2018/07/20/28ae5820-8c3f-11e8-8aea-86e88ae760d8_story.html?utm_term=.9c0da34925c1) made by the Trump administration to [remove a ban](https://www.axios.com/wilbur-ross-us-deal-china-zte-trump-trade-war-0872509e-6f55-4e90-bf8b-b57c8d27cb55.html) on US companies selling parts to ZTE. That deal was originally unveiled on June 7th.

Axios on the deal: 

> * The Commerce Department announced that the terms of the agreement include a $1 billion fine against ZTE plus $400 million in escrow to cover any future violations in exchange for the U.S. lifting its ban.

> * "These penalties are in addition to the $892 million in penalties ZTE has already paid to the U.S government under the March 2017 settlement agreement," the Department said.

> * ZTE will also have to "retain a team of special compliance coordinators selected by and answerable to" the Department for 10 years.

When the deal was shown, there was some degree of [bipartisan disagreement](https://www.axios.com/bipartisan-bashing-congress-china-trump-zte-deal-5f6f894d-d200-4eec-857c-b980891303a1.html?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=newsletter_axiospm&stream=top) with the administration on lifting the ban.

The Senate later announced a [bipartisan effort to attach a provision](https://www.axios.com/senate-acts-to-reverse-trumps-deal-to-save-zte-1528808805-8c164def-44f2-435e-84c8-0727b0da0130.html) to a must-pass defense bill to prevent the Trump administration's deal.

Axios on why the Senate didn't want the ban lifted:

> * This is the second time in a year ZTE was caught selling to North Korea and Iran, notes Van Hollen, despite agreeing that a second infraction would be met with an effective death penalty â€” a ban from using US technology, including microprocessors that are critical in the manufacturer's products.

> * ZTE has been accused of sabotaging its products to aid Chinese spies tapping into U.S. communications networks.

> * "This undermines the credibility of sanctions. It shows that if you get caught and get caught again, you only get a slap on the wrist, "said Van Hollen.

*What specific changes occurred that caused Congressional support to shift from opposing the ZTE deal to sanctioning it?*
