STEPHANIE: Cabernet Franc. This is only the fifth year we've made this varietal. Very few wineries around here do a straight Cabernet Franc. It's from our vineyard up in Santa Maria. And it was a Silver Medal winner at Paso Robles last year.
MILES: Well, I've come to never expect greatness from a Cab Franc, and this one's no exception. Sort of a flabby, overripe --
JACK: Tastes good to me. You live around here, Stephanie?
STEPHANIE: In Santa Ynez. And I agree with you about Cab Franc.
JACK: Oh yeah? We're just over in Buellton. Windmill Inn.
STEPHANIE: Oh yeah.
JACK: You know a gal named Maya? Works at the Hitching Post?
STEPHANIE: Sure I know Maya. Real well.
JACK: No shit. We just had a drink with her last night. Miles knows her.
