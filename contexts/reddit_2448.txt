Fired for insubordination. How to handle conversation in future interviews?
Hello Career Guidance,

I was fired 2 weeks ago due to insubordination regarding holding my team accountable to the attendance policy. Senior Management told all managers to write up their hourly teams if they called in during the COVID-19 outbreak, and long story short I had my team disregard that. I just got called by our HRBP saying  that I was marked as unrehirable.  How should I handle this conversation when it pops up in interviews? Thanks for any advice.
