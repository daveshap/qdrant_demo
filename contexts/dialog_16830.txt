WORM: ....you have it...easy....you know? You have a father who loves you, huh?
STANLEY: Yes.
WORM: You know what it's like to come home scared, scared that maybe if you don't have the money you're supposed to go out each day and get that you're gonna get beaten....by a belt...he hits me with a belt, Stanley.... I'm supposed to sell those candy bars, and if I don't, I come home without the money....
STANLEY: ....Why does he do it...?
WORM: Cause he hates me....he hates me so much.
STANLEY: It's not right.
WORM: I hate it.
WORM: I'm sorry to put all this on you, Stanley --
STANLEY: I have money.
WORM: ...what...?
STANLEY: I have money to give you.
WORM: No. No. I have to do this on my own.
STANLEY: I can take you to get money. I don't need it...I don't <u>need</u> it -- listen to me: I can let you have money so your father won't hit you ever again -- you'll have the money because I don't need it.
