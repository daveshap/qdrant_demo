DARIEN: I'm sorry. I was afraid something like this could happen.
BUD: Talk about being bent over the sink of life and being dry humped. I handed it to him on a silver platter. I told my father and those people...
DARIEN: Buddy, it's not your fault, and it's not your decision.
BUD: I'm not gonna let it happen Darien.
DARIEN: Don't cross Gordon. He'll crush you. You've worked hard to get where you are. If Gordon doesn't buy Bluestar someone else will; and who's to say they won't do the same thing.
BUD: At least I wouldn't be pulling the trigger.
DARIEN: Are you mad! Why are you doing this! We're so close, the town is going to be ours. Don't throw away your future Bud!
BUD: I can stay with the brokerage firm. And you're doing fine. We can survive without Gordon Gekko.
DARIEN: I'm not looking to just survive. I've been doing that all my life.
BUD: What the hell's that supposed to mean?
