Liquid water has no rotational spectrum but does absorb in the microwave region I came across a wikipedia page and it states \"Liquid water has no rotational spectrum but does absorb in the microwave region\"water molecules rotates while in transit which causes friction so it's heat upeven a single molecules rotates when it come across the instance of interaction with microwavethen radiates the energy to rest again  so what does the statement mean exactly, is it contradictory?
