My parents forced me into a degree I hate
I am f(18) and I am in my first year of university. My parents really pushed for me to apply for “honorary” degrees such as medicine and law. I am now currently studying law. I absolutely hate it. I am completely and utterly unhappy to the point that I hate going to uni and I am not interested in doing my work. My sister is currently in honours (genetics) for a bachelor of science degree, and they expect me to study a degree of the same caliber. They’ve told our entire family and all our friends what I am studying so I am scared to change and appear as the “disappointment” of the family. 

My real passion is English and music, and I’ve tried to bring it up with my parents but they simply brush it off saying that’s no way to provide for a family. I don’t know whether I should flunk out, stick out my whole degree etc. 

Any and all advice is appreciated
