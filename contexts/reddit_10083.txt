Looking for a mentor in the NYC area
Hi there,
I'm relocating to the NYC area come the new year and would love to get in touch with some academic advisors working at either a community college or public four year. 

A bit about me:
I've really struggled since graduating with my masters in 2015, and having a location bound job search. I'm hopeful for more opportunities in the upcoming year.

I'm very interested in working with at risk student populations, and have experience with lgbt, academically dismissed students.

Thanks! Please feel free to pm!
