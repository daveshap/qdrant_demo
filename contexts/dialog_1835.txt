BUD: I thought maybe I could put in a word for you with Mr. Sheldrake -- get you a little promotion -- how would you like to be an elevator starter?
FRAN: I'm afraid there are too many other girls around here with seniority over me.
BUD: No problem. Why don't we discuss it sometime over the holidays -- I could call you and pick you up and we'll have the big unveiling -- -- you sure this is the right way to wear it?
FRAN: I think so.
BUD: You don't think it's tilted a little too much --
FRAN: Here.
BUD: After all, this is a conservative firm -- I don't want people to think I'm an entertainer --
FRAN: What is it?
BUD: The mirror -- it's broken.
FRAN: I know. I like it this way -- makes me look the way I feel.
FRAN: Your phone.
BUD: Oh. Yes? Just a minute. If you don't mind -- this is sort of personal
FRAN: All right. Have a nice Christmas.
