I feel alone in this situation, not a good start to highschool either.
Hey there. I haven't been feeling so well. I used to care and give all my passion and love to someone. Someone that became very special to me. Last year, this person started treating me very badly. Losing this person was like losing what I wanted and strived to be. Now it feels like I gave everything away. There's nothing left inside except sorrow and desperation. My body has become useless and my soul is scarred. The mind itself is contemplating scenarios to fix something that can no longer be fixed or helped. That person gave up, they don't care. Why am I still waiting around for them? Why is there still hope inside of my heart? I don't understand why I still have these dreams. I just constantly dream and fantasize. I need to stop this obsession. Giving and caring is what I want to be. Yet, I just work for him. I just wait for him. Putting my emotions and mental health in constant danger, like an indirect suicide attempt towards my mind. I ask myself this question every day, why are you doing this for him? Just move on. What should I do to help myself?
