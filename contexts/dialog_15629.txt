STEPHANIE: You're in pain.
MAURICE: I need your help.
STEPHANIE: They told me, you might try to talk me into something... You need to rest Mr. Parker... It's for your own good. I've been following your story for a long while. It's a beautiful thing you did.
MAURICE: You ever lose somebody Stephanie?
STEPHANIE: Mr. Parker, I'm supposed to give you your fish sticks.
STEPHANIE: ... My father.
MAURICE: Did you tell him everything you wanted to? Did you do everything you could while he was here?
