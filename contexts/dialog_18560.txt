VICTORIA: This is my good John Brown.
DISRAELI: Yes.
VICTORIA: I have asked him to show you a little of Highland life while you are with us at Balmoral.
BROWN: What brings you here?
DISRAELI: A man can refuse only so many invitations from his Queen. It was remiss of me not to come earlier.
BROWN: What do you know about the Highlands?
DISRAELI: I am a blank sheet.
BROWN: Do you hunt?
DISRAELI: Occasionally.
BROWN: Dare say you can be taught.
DISRAELI: To shoot perhaps, but not to kill.
BROWN: If you hunt, you kill.
