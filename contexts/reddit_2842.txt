How do I stay positive during the depressing stages of the job hunt?
6 months ago I left a job with a major publisher due to an extremely unhealthy work environment. I knew the position I accepted was only "temporary" while I figured out what it is that I actually want to be doing. However, I've now found myself extremely depressed in this transitional position and I need out. 

I've now been applying to positions that I am very excited for, however the process is slow and we've all experienced the anxiety from never hearing back.

I am a very qualified editor, with 7 years of publishing experience, but the job market is slim.

How do you stay positive about the job hunt when you don't hear back from recruiters and are in a position that currently makes you miserable?
