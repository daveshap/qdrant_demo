STARKS: This is really happening, isn't it?
DR. LORENSON: [Beat] What do you need me to do?
STARKS: [Beat] Thank you.
STARKS: I need to get this letter to someone.
DR. LORENSON: I can't take you out of here in your condition...
STARKS: And I can't stay here in my condition. I am going to die tonight. It's already been decided.
DR. LORENSON: No, it hasn't.
STARKS: Yes. [Beat] It has. Everything up 'till today is done. Everything starting with tomorrow is up for grabs.
STARKS: You know how to get there?
LORENSON: Sure. It's an easy address. A little far out there, but easy enough.
STARKS: Good.
