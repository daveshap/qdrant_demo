I wish I would have never gotten this job at the fucking railroad
I've been on this job with the railroad for the past 2 months now. Everything about it is awesome, the pay, the benefits, and the retirement as well. I'm getting a little bit more comfortable with doing some of the work and hopefully will be passing the conductor's certification test in 2 weeks. But the problems are what the work schedule is, or rather lack thereof. You are on call 24/7, with no guaranteed days off. So I can't make plans for anything or with anyone. Essentially, I can't have a life. And the only reason that's a problem for me is because I'm only 19, turning 20 in a month. I'm wondering if I didn't start this job too early and am giving up my social life. I want to railroad, I just don't know if it's the right time. And to top it all off, everyone in my family is so happy for me. My dad's good friend helped me get the job here. My dad gets so excited when I talk about my job and so do all of his friends when they hear about how I'm doing. My mom and stepdad are the same way. My dad told me the other day how proud he was of me. So now if I quit, no matter what I do, everyone will be so disappointed. And they'll always think or tell me, "You had a really good job with the railroad," "This new job you have isn't as good as the railroad." I honestly wish I would have never gotten this stupid fucking job. Because now I'm stuck no matter what the fuck I do.
