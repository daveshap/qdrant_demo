I am broke, jobless, carless, and now...I'm probably going to go hungry for the next few months.
I was very slowly getting back on my feet. I've made plans to get rid of my car and put whatever I got toward something super cheap but also not a piece of crap. I've been making 5-10 applications a day, 5 days a week looking for a new job. I was approved for EBT benefits and I had an employment training class to go to today. I planned everything out as best I could. 30 minute walk to the bus stop, 20 minute ride downtown, then another 24-25 minutes to walk to the office I needed to be at. I showed up at the bus stop *on time*, only to be informed by a nice gentleman in the parking lot beside it that the bus got there 15 minutes ago and had left. Now, I know the route that this bus takes, which means that the only way I would have gotten to it would have been to have precognitive abilities and known that it'd be there 15 minutes ahead of schedule. 

What does this mean? This means I lose my EBT benefits, automatically. There's no rescheduling this class, or showing up late, or anything like that. I'm fucking screwed. My boyfriend is stretching himself thin just covering my third of the rent for a couple of months while I struggle to find any sort of job. We have some food in the kitchen but it'll all be gone in a month. So unless I can call up to the office and confirm that my new student status means I don't need the class (unlikely), or I magically get a job in the next few weeks...I'm starving. My roommate will be fine, as he rarely eats at home anyway. But my boyfriend and I will probably have to take up hunting squirrels and fishing in creeks until I figure something out. 

Yay.
