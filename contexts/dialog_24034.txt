EDDIE: Jesus, what do you think this is -- Wheel of Fortune? Let me spell it out for you. You have to hide like you don't even exist. You have to get so far hidden away that you never see sunlight.
CHRISTY: Okay -- no limo.
EDDIE: No nothing.
CHRISTY: What're you gonna do, put me in a bag and bury me?
EDDIE: I'm gonna put you in the last place on Earth that Vince would ever look for you.
CHRISTY: I hate you. I totally hate you.
EDDIE: Safest place in the world. You think Vince would look for you here?
CHRISTY: Nuns, Eddie. There are nuns here. Everywhere. It's crawling with 'em.
EDDIE: It's a convent. All you have to do is shut up, behave yourself, and get along.
CHRISTY: With nuns? With rulers? No way. I'm gonna go back, work things out with Vince.
