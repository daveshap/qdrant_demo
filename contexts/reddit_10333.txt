I would give everything to be straight
I'd give my soul to the devil to be straight. I wish i was straight more than anything. I want to die. I want to fucking kill myself and never breathe again. 

No one understands what it's like to be gay. How shit, unfortunate and depression it really is. You're dating pool is nearly non existent so you most likely will never find someone, even if you do find someone you cannot ever create a real, traditional, biological family with them. Before any of this, you have to deal with homophobia, realizing you're a worthless dissapointment to your parents, that you betrayed them. 

This is how i feel every single day of my worthless life. Every single day. I'm sick of it. I want to kill myself.
