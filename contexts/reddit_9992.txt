Grad School: How much to talk in class?
Hi, all.

I'm in my first semester of a student affairs MA program.  My class is 27 people or so.  

I am trying to gage how often I should contribute to conversations.  There are few students in the class who are disengaged, and everyone has a different opinion on a topic.  Everyone wants to share what they've experienced, learned or created.  I worry that sometimes I contribute a little too much.  I have asked classmates if they think so, and they haven't noticed, but I'm feeling this way for some reason.

How do you ensure that you speak enough to earn the maximum participation points for the class, but also give others a chance to earn their points and contribute to the conversation?  Always having something to say has been nothing but advantageous for me in my education, but now I'm in a class of folks with the same inclination and I'm not sure how to conduct myself.

Thanks!
