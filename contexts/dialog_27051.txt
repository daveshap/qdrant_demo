ELAINE: Lives high off the hog and waits for the next big thing. Like me -- but on a grander scale of failure.
WILSON: Now, you shouldn't run yourself down. My employer, Mr. Lindgren --
ELAINE: -- Your employer?
WILSON: -- Mr. Lindgren.
ELAINE: Who's Mr. Lindgren?
WILSON: My employer.
ELAINE: What line is he in.
WILSON: Proprietor of a London firm. Of longstanding.
ELAINE: I see.
WILSON: Based in London, but with international concerns.
ELAINE: I bet.
WILSON: Various enterprises, style of thing.
ELAINE: I thought you said you never did an honest day's work in your life.
WILSON: Well, not to say Mr. Lindgren is dishonest, exactly.
ELAINE: Right.
WILSON: Anyhow, he's always saying to me, Dave, never run yourself down, son -- 'cause there'll always be plenty of people willing to do it for you.
ELAINE: In what capacity are you employed by this Mr. Lindgren?
WILSON: This and that. Y'know. Ways and means.
ELAINE: -- When he wants someone run down, you're willing to do it for him.
ELAINE: So what's the deal. You and Terry Valentine at twenty paces. Is that what this is about.
WILSON: Why not.
ELAINE: Are you serious.
WILSON: Have you ever known me not to be.
ELAINE: You fuckin' guys and your dicks.
WILSON: What'd you want me to do. Stay at home, twiddlin' me thumbs. Doing sweet F.A. [Fuck All].
ELAINE: You don't believe it was a car accident.
WILSON: What do you think.
ELAINE: Terry's never going to give you satisfaction. Not the type.
WILSON: Depends, don' it.
ELAINE: On what. What makes you so certain.
WILSON: I'll bloody well ask him.
ELAINE: There's the phone. You want his number.
