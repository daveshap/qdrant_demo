LLOYD: Hello, little orphan boy. What happened to you?
TOBY: Skateboard.
HARRY: One day they'll find a cure.
LLOYD: You brave soldier.
TOBY: What? It's nothing, the cast comes off in six weeks.
LLOYD: Of course it does. Obviously in denial. Maybe we can help.
HARRY: We're part of a special class taught by the lunch lady, er, I mean Ms. Heller. Maybe you'd like to join us, it doesn't require any walking.
LLOYD: And nobody will make fun of your horrible deformity.
TOBY: How much homework is there?
LLOYD: That's the downside. There is none.
TOBY: Wait a minute. I can spend the whole year in a class taught by the lunch lady? Can I bring my girlfriend?
LLOYD: You can bring whatever you want, little friend.
