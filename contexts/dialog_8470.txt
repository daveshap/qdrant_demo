BAUM: Mr. Masry, before you go off on some crusade, you might want to remember who it is you're dealing with here. PG&E is a 28- billion dollar corporation.
ED: Thanks. I'll keep it in mind.
ERIN: At least they made an offer.
ED: That wasn't an offer. A million would've been an offer. When they send the God damn mail clerk down to jerk me off, waste my time, it's a fuck you.
ERIN: I don't get why they'd do that.
ED: Because they can. You heard that kid -- they have 28 billion dollars at their disposal. They can afford to waste all the time in the world.
ERIN: And you can't?
ED: What, you think I'm made of money?
