STRIKER: Elaine!
ELAINE: Ted!
STRIKER: I came home early and found your note. I guess you meant for me to read it later. Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
ELAINE: I just don't want to go over it any more.
STRIKER: I know things haven't been right for a long time, but it'll be different. If you'll just be patient, I can work things out.
ELAINE: I have been patient and I've tried to help, but you wouldn't even let me do that.
STRIKER: Don't you feel anything for me at all any more?
ELAINE: It takes so many things to make love last. Most of all it takes respect. And I can't live with a man I don't respect!
