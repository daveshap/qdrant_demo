Creating VRT or index of large amount of aerial images to create mosaic in QGIS? I have about 1600 aerial images that I want to create a mosaic of. I tried doing about 400 at a time in a VRT, it's extremely slow (been building polygons for about 15 minutes now + the 20 minutes it took to build the VRT). Is there a more efficent way to do this, like by creating an index somehow? To be honest I don't know exactly what that entails, but I noticed at my job we keep large amounts of tiles indexed in an excel file, you load the file into arcmap and bam you've got a snappy large scale mosaic. Can I do something to the same effect in QGIS?
