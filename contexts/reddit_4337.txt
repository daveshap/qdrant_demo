You know what?
Tomorrow when I wake up I will brush my hair, I will also wash my face and teeth.

I will praise myself for it.

I will kick depressions ass, because you know what? I am in control of myself.

I will rebel against my own brain chemicals, because fuck you.

I declare war, you might win this fight, depression, but honey I will win the war.
