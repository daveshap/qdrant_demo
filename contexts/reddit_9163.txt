“If I can afford to buy a house, then you can too”
A friend just said this to me, yet his parents pay for all of his bills other than his mortgage. Without that, he wouldn’t be able to afford his home. 

Ah, the joy of dealing with people who think they worked hard for everything they have without acknowledging all the help from their parents, and then put you down for not being on their level. 🤬
