RADAR: Chopper coming in, Colonel. Two of them, I'm afraid.
HENRY: Damn.
RADAR: And another one, but it's from the south. There.
TRAPPER: This one goes right to the OR. Tell Duke to do him ahead of the busted spleen. And this kid can't wait. I'll take him myself, before I get to that ruptured diaphragm.
HOT LIPS: Captain... 'This kid' is a prisoner of war.
TRAPPER: Yeah?
HOT LIPS: It's an American boy's rupture you're supposed to close.
TRAPPER: Listen, we get a deluge like this, just deciding priorities on a medical basis is hard enough. So never mind the side issues.
