ERIC: How the hell were they smart enough to find us?
CORBETT: Smart? Sure. That's why I'm sitting in this plane and they're down there blowing me kisses.
CORBETT: Been driving long?
ERIC: I needed a pilot's license to take the job here, so I got one in six weeks.
CORBETT: That makes the flight more interesting.
CORBETT: See the blood? Pack of wolves took down a moose. Greedy, gut-ripping sons of bitches. I'd kill the last wolf on earth, right in front of the President of the U.S. Stinking, cowardly predator, the wolf.

ERIC: Sounds like professional jealousy.
CORBETT: Hunting and trapping was a damn fine life. Me and Mitchell, Bob and LeMalle, we were teams. I'd always go with Mitchell. Good man, Mitchell. I'd let Bob worry about goddamn LeMalle. We'd hire a plane in October. On the way to a dirt airstrip somewhere, we'd drop supplies. We'd land, tell the pilot to come back for us a few days before Christmas.
