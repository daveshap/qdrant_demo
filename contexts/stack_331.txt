Time Capsule - what happens when full, if there is more than one system backup? I have a Time Capsule that was used for backing up several offline macs, when the local drive sizes were relatively small. (Lets say theres two old backups called \"iMac\" and \"iBook\".Currently it backs up two relatively new devices (lets call them MacBook and Mini). It has become full in the last year. I know that Time Machine discards older backups to keep the most current, but how does it decide what data to keep between the different systems?
