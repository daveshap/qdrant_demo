The opposite of capitulating compromiser I was watching the movie Lincoln last night in which Thadeus Stevens, an abolitionist refers to Lincoln as a 'capitulating compromiser'. And that got me thinking about a term that could be used to describe Stevens  who was a much strong defender of equality when compared to Lincoln. How do you refer to someone who adamantly refuses to compromise? I came up with 'adamant defender' but it doesn't have the same effect as the original. What do you think would be a better alternative?
