JULIA: She'll tell them everything...
FRANK: I don't think so. She'll want Larry first.
JULIA: That's probably her now. Or the police.
FRANK: Maybe.
JULIA: Don't you care?
FRANK: There's very little I can do about it.
JULIA: Maybe we should just leave --
FRANK: Like this? Look at me! LIKE THIS?
JULIA: Well we can't just stay here --
FRANK: I need a skin. Then we leave --
NURSE: What a pretty tune.
KIRSTY: My father doesn't answer. I have to go find him.
NURSE: I'm afraid you'll have to wait until the police have spoken to you. Keep trying your father; he'll answer eventually.
KIRSTY: I called another friend of mine and he's coming over. Will you let him in?
NURSE: Of course. This isn't a prison you know. Look if you'd prefer to tell ME what happened, instead of a policeman --
KIRSTY: You wouldn't believe me.
NURSE: Try me.
NURSE: Well, if you change your mind. What's this friend's name?
KIRSTY: Steve.
