GROUCHO: With a gun like that you can kill some of your own men.
CHICO: That's-a pretty good. I'll take a dozen of them.
GROUCHO: Anything else?
CHICO: Yes, one gross of bullets, two dozen hand-grenades, three kegs of powder -- and throw in some matches.
GROUCHO: Fine. We'll throw in the matches before we make the delivery. By the way, how're you fixed for spys?
CHICO: Fine. We gotta him.
GROUCHO: So! -- He's on your side, too.
CHICO: Sure.
GROUCHO: Well, with you two fellows on the other side, this country should have no trouble keeping the wolf from the door.
