DEAN: Actually, that's not true.
SAL: You didn't squeeze DePinto?
DEAN: No, I meant I'm Presbyterian.
SAL: Oh.
DEAN: My wife's Jewish. But that probably doesn't matter right now.
FRANKIE: What is it you want?
DEAN: Someone's trying to destroy my life, and I'd like to find out who.
SAL: And then what?
DEAN: I'll see if I can, you know, work things out.
FRANKIE: Well we'd sure like to help you.
DEAN: You would?
FRANKIE: Yes. But we can't.
DEAN: Why not?
FRANKIE: Because we, and our associates, have paid out hundreds of thousands of dollars to shyster lawyers like you, <u>because</u> of shyster lawyers like you, and we'd just as soon sit back and sip a beer while you get ass-banged by as many people as possible.
