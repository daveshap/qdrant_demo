RENISE: Hey.
TED: So what's up?
RENISE: Eh.
TED: Great. Great. So listen, uh, I was wondering if maybe you wanted to go to the prom you know, with me.
TED: It's no big deal, whatever I mean, if you want.
RENISE: See, the thing is, I heard a rumor that this guy I like was gonna ask me.
TED: Uh-huh.
RENISE: Yeah, so... I'm gonna wait and see what happens there... But that sounds great, yeah.
TED: Okay. So is that a yes or a no?
RENISE: I think I was very clear, Ted. If everything else falls apart, maybe.
