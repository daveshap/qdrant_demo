WEINSTOCK: What am I, a shmuck? What's the hurry? He could see a couple of shows and visit the top of the Empire State Building.
SAL: Joel, don't jerk me. I spent a lot o' time settin' this one up.
WEINSTOCK: So whatta you want a badge? It's your first major league game Sal. One thing I learned, move calmly, move cautiously. You'll never be sorry.
SAL: I been damn careful up to now.
WEINSTOCK: Which is why your phone lines are tapped and the Feds are crawlin' all over you like flies.
SAL: I'm straight, Joel. They haven't got shit on me. Look, I'm tellin' you, he'll take the deal somewhere else.
WEINSTOCK: He could go someplace else with his sixty kilos of heroin and see how easy it is to pull together a half million cash. He wouldn't find there was any hurry to do this kind of business.
