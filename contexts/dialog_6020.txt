MARIA: Lia'll be so glad to see you, you'll see. And you won't recognize the kids any more, they're grown up by now.
SALVATORE: They're always writing to me saying they want to come to Rome!
MARIA: See how pretty the house is? We did everything over. If it hadn't been for you! Come, I have a surprise.... You must be tired. If you want to rest, there's time before the funeral.
SALVATORE: No, Mamma, it only takes an hour by air, you know.
MARIA: You shouldn't tell me that now. After all these years! I put all your things in here. Go in, go in...
