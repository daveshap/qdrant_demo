The stupid non-response game
I [20M] am just fed up with the stupid game that people play when someone doesn't respond immediately. It's happened a few times where I'm talking with someone pretty regularly, snap back and for a few times in the morning and then I'll go on a run for an hour or two where I won't check my phone. 

Then, all of a sudden, it's just no responses to any questions, won't open msgs except for a day or two. 

Like people are busy, I get it if you're out busy doing stuff, but going back and forth to see who can avoid the other person for longer is stupidly destructive towards building any relationship ever.
