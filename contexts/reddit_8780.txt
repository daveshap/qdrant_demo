Is re-election dependent on the economy, and what are the arguments for and against near term recession?
There have been [a number of sources](https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/15/politics/donald-trump-reelection-bid-economy/index.html) that have claimed that the chances for [re-election are inextricably tied to the economy](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-15/trump-s-re-election-now-at-the-mercy-of-a-slowing-economy). Have there been presidencies that have proven this right and wrong?

If the two are linked, then what are the arguments for and against a near term recession happening in time to impact this election?
