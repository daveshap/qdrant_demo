What are some good sites to learn about modern politics and party ideologies?
Hello! So I'm new to this subreddit. Lately I've been interested a lot in politics and since I'm young, I wanted to know how I could gain more knowledge about modern politics. Like the ideologies of parties and what not. My civics class just didn't do it for me and I don't have any history courses this year since I'm a freshman in a collegiate high school program. Any website link or or site relating to modern politics would be helpful. Thanks in advance.
