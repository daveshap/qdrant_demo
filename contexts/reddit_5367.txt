How many of you guys feel like you’re competent at your job and what type of role do you have (I.e. customer facing, data wrangling etc.)? As in....fully competent, never make mistakes?
I’m very curious how others are doing in their roles as I’ve been in my role for 3 months and am not as competent as I would like to be. Especially in the type of role I am in as a Data Analyst dealing with clients. On many occasions, while sending out reports to clients little mistakes are made that would’ve been caught if I spent significant time checking each cell in the file, however, there is no time in the world to check these files.
