Essential Reads for Student Affairs Grad Students?
Hey everyone!  I recently got accepted to a great master's program for student affairs and I'm incredibly excited to start this fall!  I'm currently working full time, and still have free time to read.  I know that's going away soon, so I want to get a jump start on learning more about the field.  

Are there any books that you've found really useful in you classes, any authors that would be worth looking into before attending an MA program?
