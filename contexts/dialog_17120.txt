ANDY: So, Mr. Besserman, same slot tomorrow...?
MANAGER: Eh, I dunno... Andy. I'm... thinkin' of letting you go...
ANDY: You're firing me?? You don't even pay me!
MANAGER: Look -- I don't wanna seem insulting. But... your act is like amateur hour: Singalongs... puppets... playing records...
ANDY: What do you want? Take my wife
MANAGER: Sure! Comedy! Make jokes about the traffic. Do impressions. Maybe a little blue material...
ANDY: I don't swear. I -- I don't do what everyone else does!
MANAGER: Well, everyone else gets this place cookin'! Pal, it's hard for me to move the booze when you're singin' Pop Goes The Weasel.""
