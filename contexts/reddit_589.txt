Getting another job
Over the previous summer i worked at a Walmart and absolutely hated it, i was an awful employee, called in sick a bajillion times and just ghosted the company instead of quitting respectfully. I realize what i did was terrible and i think it's making it harder for me to find another job.

So i guess my questions are:

1. is it even worth it to put my time on Walmart onto a resume?
2. Will a prospective company find out if I exclude it?
3. and what types of jobs are available to someone with a bad track-record?
