I challenge you all to give me five minutes of your time.
Just in case nobody has told you in a while, unclench your teeth.  Let your tongue come down from the roof of your mouth.  Relax your shoulders.  Take some deep breaths through your nose, hold them for a few seconds, and release them.  Now, just breath until youâ€™re able to sink in to your bed or your seat with your eyes closed.
