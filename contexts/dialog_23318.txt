MR. STUBBINS: Mrs... Sutphin?
MOM: Right here!
MR. STUBBINS: Mrs. Sutphin, I'm Paul Stubbins, Chip's math teacher.
MOM: Nice to meet you, Mr. Stubbins. A little something I baked.
MR. STUBBINS: Oooohh! A fruit cake. Thank you, Mrs. Sutphin. Have a seat.
MOM: Bon Appetit!
MR. STUBBINS: Chip is off to a fine start this year. Focused... conscientious... participates actively in classroom discussion.
MOM: He's a good boy.
MR. STUBBINS: There is one big problem though.
MOM: What is it, Mr. Stubbins?
MR. STUBBINS: His unhealthy obsession with sick horror films.
MOM: He is assistant manager of a video shop...
MR. STUBBINS: That's no excuse for a morbid imagination. I caught him drawing this in class last week. Is there a problem at home?
MOM: Certainly not!
MR. STUBBINS: Divorce? An alcoholic relative? Tell me, did Chip torture animals when he was young?
MOM: No, he did not! We are a loving supportive family, Mr. Stubbins.
MR. STUBBINS: Well, you're doing something wrong, Mrs. Sutphin. I'd recommend therapy for your son. Thank you for taking the time to come to PTA.
