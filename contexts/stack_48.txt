MacBook Pro early 2011 hangs at \u201cwhite screen\u201d I tried the following, but at each one except the single user mode, it is stuck on the white screen. This problem occurred after I shut down the MacBook Pro using power button after the screen froze I tried booting from external USB, CMD+R, CMD+OPTION+R, OPTION, While it is stuck at white screen it overheats, and sometimes restartsI cannot reinstall MacOS or enter recovery or internet recovery or even erase the hard disk because it always ets stuck at the white screen.Is there any way to fix it using terminal at single user mode?
