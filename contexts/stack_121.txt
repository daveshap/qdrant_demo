Completely disable a keyboard shortcut for one application When using Microsoft Remote Desktop, I frequently find myself accidentally trying to close browser tabs with \u2318W (which is mapped to \"Close Connection\" by default).  I was at least able to stop it from closing the connection every time by mapping it to one of the help menu options, but it's still annoying to have a window pop up every time I do it.What I really want is for it to do nothing, but all I can find is how to assign a different key combination to the command (which doesn't work in this case for some reason, it just adds it as a second shortcut in addition to \u2318W) or how to assign the key combination to a different command. Is there any way to disable the shortcut entirely instead?Update: this seems to specifically be a problem with Microsoft Remote Desktop version 8.
