RAND: Betsy, can I talk to you a minute?
BETSY: Of course, Wes.
RAND: Does she suffer? Does she know what she is?
BETSY: I don't know. I once asked Dr. Maxwell the same question. He said he thought she was like a sleepwalker who would never waken.
RAND: She hated sleep. She used to say it was a thief -- stealing away her life, an hour at a time...
BETSY: Not to a nurse. Sleep is a cure.
RAND: She's dead. The dead ought to be buried.
BETSY: But she's not dead, Wes.
RAND: You know what she is! That's death -- no mind, no senses -- no love, no hate, no feeling -- nothing!
BETSY: Please, Wes, do as I ask. You must rest, you must sleep.
