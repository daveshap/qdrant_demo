Every Time It Gets Better, It Gets Worse
Every time I manage to dig myself out of the hole bit by fragile bit, something inevitably pushes me back below. Something small, something big, something as simple as the passage of time. A single bad day, a single bad conversation. When things finally, *finally* start looking up something awful always happens to bring me back down. What do you do when this happens? How do you stop the downward spiral you know is coming? I don't know what to do anymore. I'm so tired.
