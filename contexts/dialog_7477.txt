JABEZ: Ma says breakfast's ready, Mr. Webster!
WEBSTER: Breakfast ... Ah! ... Come along friends, Ma Stone's a cook this side of heaven.
TOM SHARP: Jabez -- will you join our Grange now?
JABEZ: Why, thank you, Tom. I was going to ask you if you thought I could.
TOM SHARP: We'll be mighty glad to have you with us.
WEBSTER: There is nothing like a good old country breakfast. Where's Ma?
MARY: She'll be here in a moment. She has a special surprise for you.
