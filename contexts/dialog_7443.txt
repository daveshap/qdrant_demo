JABEZ: Queer sort of weather we're having -- queer like everything else.
MA STONE: Well, thank the Lord you can always depend on New England for weather. We've got enough for the whole United States.
JABEZ: I feel -- fidgety, Ma -- not right at all.
MA STONE: Lan's, I'd think you was having the baby, to hear you.
JABEZ: Me -- a son.
JABEZ: Money -- money's a funny thing, ain't it, Ma?
MA STONE: I figure that depends a mite on how you get it and how you spend it, Son.
JABEZ: Do you really think that?
MA STONE: Why, that's just sense, Son. Now a man like Daniel Webster -- guess they pay him high for what he does. But he's worth it -- and he helps others. Makes all the difference.
JABEZ: I know, Ma, but -- Suppose a man got his money in bad ways --
MA STONE: Wouldn't profit him none.
MA STONE: You see, son? I'm old and I've lived. When a man gets his money in bad ways -- when he sees the better course and takes the worse -- then the devil is in his heart -- and that fixes him.
JABEZ: Ma -- and yet, a man could change that, couldn't he?
MA STONE: A man can always change things, Son. That's what makes him different from barnyard critters.
