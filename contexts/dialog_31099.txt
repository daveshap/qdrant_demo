SAILOR: What's she doin' here?
BOBBY: She's my girl... She's drivin'... That bother you?
SAILOR: Why should it?
BOBBY: That's right... Take one of these.
SAILOR: What is it?
BOBBY: Panty hose. Work better'n stockin's. Pull one of the legs down over your face and let the other leg trail behind your head. You get the pistol. Remember, soon as we get inside, you keep that bad boy up where those hicks can see it. Once they notice the Ithaca and the Smith, they'll know we ain't foolin' with 'em.
