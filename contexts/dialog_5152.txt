EVAN: I just thought you should know.
KAYLEIGH: Know what?
EVAN: That I didn't leave you there to rot.
KAYLEIGH: There's one major hole in your story.
EVAN: Which is?
KAYLEIGH: There is no fuckin' way on this planet or any other that I was in some fuckin' sorority.
KAYLEIGH: Sure you don't want your wallet?
EVAN: Don't think I'll need it where I'm going.
KAYLEIGH: Off to change everyone's life again, is that it? Maybe this time you'll pop up in some mansion while I wind up in Tijuana doing the donkey act.
EVAN: I'm over it. Whenever I try to help anyone it all turns to shit.
KAYLEIGH: Well, don't give up now, Slick. You've already done so much for me. Hell, why don't you go back in time and save Mrs. Halpern and her baby. Then maybe Lenny wouldn't freak out and ruin my family.
