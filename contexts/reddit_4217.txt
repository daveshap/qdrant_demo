Tinder Archetypes
I jumped back into online dating and I've noticed a few patterns in some guys' profiles. It's like some are trying to be a different version of the same guy. I'm sure everyone does this to some degree, but it's interesting to see what "archetypes" are popular in your area/age group. 

If you've noticed a pattern in girls'/guys' profiles, add an archetype!

- I'm here for a good time not a long time

- Don't bother messaging me if you can't xyz/If you can xyz, you can talk to me (xyz= usually knowing the lyrics of a particular song he likes word for word)
