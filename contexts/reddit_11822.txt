A career goal was reached, but the next stage is daunting.
I studied for a computer certification for over two months.  Took the test and passed. (much relief and joy)  Now the waiting is killing me.  Resume' is in position with two companies that have a job slot for my certification.  No responses yet and the prospect of the job, moving, and balancing the new finances is worrying with the holidays looming.
