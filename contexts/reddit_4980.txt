Cannot motivate myself at all... help.
I've been dealing with depression for a while and anxiety too. I am in a viscous circle. This semester in college started out great...was getting A's on everything, doing generally really well. Then I found out that my grandmother who I'm super close to was being put in hospice care and is very very sick with heart failure. Then my grandfather passed away suddenly. I feel like my professors don't believe me, because it happened weeks apart from each other. I stopped going to class, dropped one because I didn't go to an exam. I literally have not been able to get myself to write papers for one of my classes. I feel like I'm losing it. I haven't done laundry in weeks and have no clean clothes. I made an appointment with a psychiatrist but didn't show up. Same thing with an appointment for an advisor to ask for help choosing classes. I just didn't show up, no call no show.  I've been desperately trying to fix myself but I get overwhelmed anytime I start studying or researching for this paper. I'm too ashamed to seek help because I didn't show up to previous appointments.

I have become really good at seeming fine and normal, but I'm just lying at this point. I feel so much guilt about everything so it's like some fucked up defense mechanism to at least appear okay. But I'm lying. If anyone has advice on how to push past this absolute avolition and apathy... so I can stop feeling guilty and lying about my situation.
