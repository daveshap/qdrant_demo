Right Super key not opening Dash on Ubuntu 18.04 I have an odd issue with Super key. As for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, it isn't opening the dash menu any more.My mechanical keyboard layout is Brazilian. The only difference is that it has a Fn key where the left Super is supposed to be. So I only have the right Super.I tried to keybind, but there is no option for the dash menu. I know some folks had this issue with Unity and they fixed with a tweak application. But now we have GNOME.
