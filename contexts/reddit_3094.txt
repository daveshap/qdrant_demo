Former Recruiters of Reddit, how did you get out of this awful industry and find a new job?
I’ve been a technical recruiter for 2 years now, doing IT recruiting and I hate it. Like despise it. I want to find a new job but the only things I hear from are for recruiting firms! Any idea how l can use these skills and market them towards something that’s not recruiting?
