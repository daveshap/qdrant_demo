HAN: That was no laser blast .... some- thing hit us ....
LEIA: Or you ran into something ....
HAN: Asteroids! Chewie, bank left, let's find out where they're coming from ...
LEIA: Probably an asteroid field ....
HAN: Let's hope so ... it's just the chance we need.
LEIA: To get killed ... you're not seriously going into an asteroid field?
HAN: Aren't I? Hang on, sweetheart. We're gonna do some flyin'.

ADMIRAL PIETT: My lord.
VADER: Come in, Admiral.
ADMIRAL PIETT: Our pursuit ships have sighted the Millennium Falcon, My Lord. It has entered an asteroid field.
VADER: Asteroids don't concern me, Admiral. I want that ship, not excuses. How long until you can have Skywalker and the others in the Millennium Falcon before me?
ADMIRAL PIETT: Soon, Lord Vader.
VADER: Yes, Admiral .... soon.
HAN: Well, you said you wanted to be there when I was wrong.
LEIA: I take it back.
HAN: That Star Destroyer is slowing down.
LEIA: Good.
HAN: But we're going to get pulverized if we stay out here much longer.
LEIA: I'm against that.
HAN: We've got to get out of this shower.
LEIA: Now you're making sense.
HAN: Right. I'm going to get in closer to one of these big ones ...
THREEPIO: Closer?!
LEIA: Closer?!
