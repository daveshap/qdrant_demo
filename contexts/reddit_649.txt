Hello this is my first time here
I am 14 years old I’m in high school and me and this girl have been dating for 2 months now and I really love her and I feel like she delivers that same loving energy back but me and this girl get into arguments pretty often and I’m always the first one that apologizes and sometimes I feel like that doesn’t even work and I try to show her that I love her with my actions and at this point I’m just confused cause I really love this girl and I feel like this one is the one but at the same time I’m not sure because all my last relationship I’ve been cheated on and I’m just looking for advice that would help me last long with this girl because I reallly do love her like I would do anything for this girl some advice pls
