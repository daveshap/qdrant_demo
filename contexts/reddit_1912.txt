Prestige changes people...
Long story short, I was accepted to a top university. It’s the first time this has happened in my area so everyone was pretty impressed. 

However, going through high school I was never really liked by most of my teachers. I worked hard but they didn’t like me due to my family connections. Both my mom and sister went to the same high school I did, and they both had mental disabilities that made them difficult for the school to deal with. This meant that they were a hassle to teach, and therefore not liked by the faculty. This ended up also applying to me as I went through high school. Even if I did well, I didn’t have the right last name and often got kicked to the side. 

Now that I’ve been accepted into a nice school, everybody likes me now. My old teachers who unfairly graded me and refused to recommend me or nominate me for school positions are now friending me on facebook, making posts about how they’re so proud of me and that they are honored to have taught me, and sending me personal messages of how they are glad they helped me in my journey. They’re talking to my mom, who they once treated so poorly, about how proud they are of her and me both. She knows it’s all lies and attempts to take credit for me. 

These teachers did the bare minimum to help me, and now it pisses me off that they’re trying to take credit for the success I’ve had that they tried so hard to keep me from. I hate all of it. I was always teased at my school by the principals and guidance counselor for applying to big schools. They would always mock me or say I was wasting my money. And now that I’ve actually done something, they’re so excited to post me on facebook and brag about me on senior day. 

Sure, I’m happy that I’ve gotten this far, but I hate that everyone is trying to take credit for my own doing.
