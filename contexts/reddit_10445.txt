Is there really a good reason to be alive?
Seriously, all I see on here is people saying the same things,” It will get better.”,” What about your family or friends?”,” Suicide is a permanent solution is a temporary problem.” saying the same things over and over again that don’t mean anything. Is there a reason suicidal people should stay alive BESIDES living for other people, so other people won’t feel bad about it? 

All I keep seeing are these the same cringy quotes and it’s just making me even more suicidal. I swear if I hear more of that dumb shit I’m going to just end it already.
