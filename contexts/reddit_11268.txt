Applying for colleges
I hate the typical small talk between adults now at my age. It always leads to "So what colleges are you looking at?". This always pisses me off because I really have no idea where I want to attend. Neither of my parents attended college so they don't have a clue about how all of this works out. My biggest fear that is giving me the most anxiety is not getting accepted to a good school. No offense, but I think that getting into a good school is what makes or breaks the rest of your life. I know that may be horrible to say but that fact keeps me up at night. I have good grades, averaging an A-, but I'm still scared about this whole application process. I feel like the first good college that responds back I am going to go to no matter what. I know this might just be a hopeless rant to you but college is really worrying me. I'm afraid of senior year, having all the kids brag about the colleges in other states that their rich moms and dads pay for. Any advice on the application process?

EDIT: Thanks for all the help with the feedback! I'm planning on going to a local university that my mom works at (so i'd get free tuition) and I'm trying to start with Finance) so that is looking like my number one choice right now.
