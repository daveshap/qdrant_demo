There is this guy and idk what to do.
He is so cute, and he really likes me, and I thought I liked him too but now I’m not so sure. At first I friend zoned him before he got the chance to tell me how he felt ( because I knew already and I wanted him to stop wasting time with me) then we went to a youth conference and we might have held hands ( he was trying so hard, how could I not ?!) and later I friend zoned him again. Then a few months later at a dance we hugged and I thought I felt a connection and he texted me later and said he still had feelings for me and I said I might have some too. He said I could take my time figuring it out ( how cute is that ) and then we went on some dates, held hands a few more times but then I told him I wasn’t ready for a relationship and we needed to stop. It’s almost been a year since I found out he liked me and he still isn’t over me and I’m so confused as to how I feel. Can anyone help?
