How to move on after being rejected from your dream job?
I applied for what would basically be my dream job a couple of months ago. I had phone interview, and have been waiting to hear if I made it to the in-person round of interviews. 

I received an email today letting me know they are going forward with someone else. 

Itâ€™s just another heartbreak in a year of trying to find a job. This one just hurts more than the others since the job meant a lot and I felt I had a really good chance. 

How do I move on? How do I stop getting attached or hopeful about any position?
