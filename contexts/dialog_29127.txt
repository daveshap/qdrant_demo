BOND: Q! How are you?
Q: Retired. I'm not getting paid to help you save the world anymore.
BOND: I'm sorry. It was a national emergency -
Q: That hardly makes up for the imposition. Now, for what I hope will be the very last time - pay attention, 007. First, computer generated retrograde analysis map. Body here, meteorolog- ical influences here, likely vector- ing of the ship's coordinates here.
BOND: Do you have any idea of what any of that means? In English?
Q: Not a clue. I didn't lose the ship. Next, your new personal communicator. Picture-phone, fax, beeper.
BOND: Do I have to dial '9' to get out?
Q: I don't care who you dial, so long as it's not me. Next -
Q: Your new car.
BOND: - Four wheel drive?
Q: Yes. And do try to keep all four of them on the road. All the usual refinements: Smoke, missiles, machine guns - Fully operational remote control. Drives forward, reverse - Stop that! Plus infrared thermal imaging radar, heads up instrumentation, and 17 beverage cup holders.
BOND: ... 17 Beverage cup holders?
Q: Standard equipment. The world's automobile manufacturers seem to be in some kind of mad war to see who can provide the most beverage cup holders.
BOND: I must say, Q, you seem to be doing rather well in your retirement.
Q: Don't even think about it. 007. They're my granddaughters.
