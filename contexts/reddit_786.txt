Why did no one warn me about the loneliness
Hi, First time poster here..
So in the UK we leave school at 16 and are forced to go to either college or an apprenticeship, I did "okay" in school so I ended up getting an apprenticeship in a warehouse on a 25 year olds wage. Since I started working, living an adults life, bills, rent, care insurance etc; I've felt extremely lonely. I wasn't the most popular kid in school, Wouldn't say badly bullied to the point of depression, but bullied as such, I mainly brushed it off. I left school with a couple friends, now I rarely even see my best friend, he's either with his girlfriend, in college or in bed, I've started smoking the herb to try to see life differently but that's just making it harder to do basic life functions, I'm trying to push my self to go out on walks alone (Not really for my fitness as I work out regularly, but besides the point). Does anyone have any tips on getting over this loneliness? Is it an age thing? Or is it one of those things you never got warned about? Thank you
