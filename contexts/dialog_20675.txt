ELIZABETH: You know, Peggy Sue, your mother said you had a dream that I died.
PEGGY: I wish she hadn't.
ELIZABETH: I'm not afraid. I know exactly when I'm going to die.
BARNEY: What's it going to be, Elizabeth? Seventy—five? Eighty?
ELIZABETH: I'm not telling.
BARNEY: I've been trying to drag it out of her for years. You know, dreams are fascinating business. 'Specially where you see the future.
PEGGY: Do you believe in all of that?
BARNEY: Well, I like to speculate. This book I'm reading right now, a woman in Colorado says she lived in Ireland a hundred and fifty years ago. Her name was Bridey Murphy- and she gives names and dates and where she lived. She was hypnotized. Big bestseller.
PEGGY: I remember that book! Grandpa, Grandma, I want to tell you something.
ELIZABETH: If you believe it, darling, then I believe. Being young can be just as confusing as being old. The things that happened to me fifty years ago are more on my mind than what happened yesterday.
PEGGY: But I'm remembering the future.
ELIZABETH: Right now you're just browsing through time. Choose the things you'll be proud of. The things that Last.
PEGGY: My children make me happy. I miss them so much. Beth. Scott and Beth. I'm going to name my daughter after you.
BARNEY: It's gonna rain again. Every time I wash the car, it rains.
PEGGY: That never changes. You know, when you and Grandma are gone, the family's gone. I never see the cousins anymore.
BARNEY: It's your grandma's strudel that's kept this family together.
PEGGY: Grandpa, if you had a chance to do it all again, what would you do?
BARNEY: I'd take better care of my teeth.
ELIZABETH: What's Peggy Sue going to do at your lodge meeting?
BARNEY: It's her 18th birthday, I want to show her off.
PEGGY: It was my idea, Grandma. I always wondered what went on at those lodge meetings.
ELIZABETH: He won't tell me, but I've got my suspicions. And I don't want any of that. Don't keep her out late.
BARNEY: Let's go.
PEGGY: Good—bye, Grandma.
