Rejected after a paid lunch
I applied for this job, and got a phone interview. It went really well. They interviewer was very impressed and kept saying she loved what I was saying. A couple of weeks later I went back for in person interview that also went well, and the guy was super impressed. After I got invited back for a third interview that was lunch with the interviewers. They took me out and paid for my lunch and kept saying I can’t wait to see you in a couple of weeks and such. Today, I received an automated email saying that I wasn’t selected for the position. I don’t know what I did wrong.
