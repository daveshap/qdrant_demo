SIMON: So, what's new anyway? How's Verdell?
FRANK: Your neighbor -- Udall -- is taking care of him.
SIMON: How could you do that? He'll hurt him.
FRANK: No, I promise... not a chance. I own this guy. There was no one else. I'm on the move too much. Trust me.
SIMON: You are very certain my dog is okay... because you have no idea...
FRANK: Yes. Your dog is fine, Simon.
