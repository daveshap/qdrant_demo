I've lost all motivation and can't find reason within myself to keep trying.
Sadly I made a throwaway account with such a cool name.


Anyways, I'm 20 and I feel like I've lost sense of direction in my life. I'm currently attending community college but I'm really only going for my parents (I'd get kicked out if I didn't). I've had a really hard time motivating myself to get anything done and have been smoking weed to really help me work (clears my mind and allows me to intensely focus, although it varies by strain). Me and my girlfriend have been in turmoil for the past 2 months and it's definitely over and I've come to terms with it. I don't think that's really the sole cause of the way I feel, but I've mostly just had a shift in the way I view the world from exploring philosophical ideas and alot has been troubling me.

I feel like I'm at a crossroad in my life and I must choose the life I want, but I don't know what I want. I use to want to be creative and create videos and what not, but not I help run a wedding videography company and I just don't do any creative stuff outside of editing wedding videos. Even then I feel like I'm half-assing my job. I can really only say I have 1 friend and close coworkers but they're not the type I'd open up to.

I find myself disinterested with life, and I find myself asking myself "is this it" more and more often.

Sorry for rambling and I hope I didn't come off as an angsty 20 year old... heres a summary


**TL;DR - I'm overall just confused with what to do with my life**
