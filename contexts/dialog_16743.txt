BOBBY: What the fuck's going on?
RICKY: Dude, get back out there. You gotta help me get them in the hot tub. Hang on girls! Just get out there. I'll be right out. You know how I do.
BOBBY: Yeah, I know how you do. I know how you do. I've heard your kibbles and bits all fucking night. You've been shaking your ass like an unemployed clown. How the room's a boiling pot of sugar water. How you're gonna dip a string into it and make rockcandy. Who wants to play 'Just the tip?' Dancing around like a smacked ass. Oh, and that coat check girl you've been dragging around as 'insurance' doesn't even speak English.
RICKY: Okay. We got a lot happening here. Here comes the good part... Okay...
BIANCA: Somebody's getting comfortable.
CYNTHIA: Where's the surprise?
RICKY: You want your surprise?
CYNTHIA: Yeah. I want it.
RICKY: Well, come on then. It's back here.
