Leaflet Marker autoPan option According to the Leaflet docs the marker's autoPan option works like this:<blockquote>  Set it to true if you want the map to do panning animation when marker  hits the edges.</blockquote>What does 'the marker hits the edges' mean?When I set the option to true and add a new marker right on the edge or outside of the current view, the map does not automatically move.
