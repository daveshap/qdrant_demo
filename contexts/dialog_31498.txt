WALTER: Walter.
ROBIN: Do you have many friends?
WALTER: No.
ROBIN: How come?
WALTER: A long time ago, I was sent far away. When they let me come back, all my friends were gone.
ROBIN: It sounds like you were banished.
WALTER: Banished... yeah.
ROBIN: Birds are my friends. That sounds egotistical, but they are. Birds know I watch them, but they don't mind because they like being watched... if they know you won't hurt them.
WALTER: Robin?
ROBIN: Yes?
WALTER: Would you like to sit on my lap?
ROBIN: What?
WALTER: Would you like to sit on my lap?
ROBIN: No thank you.
WALTER: Are you sure?
ROBIN: I'm sure. Thank you all the same.
WALTER: That's okay... doesn't matter.
ROBIN: Do you want me to sit on your lap?
