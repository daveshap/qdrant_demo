Resigned with no offer in hand
So I resigned my current current contract in AUS. The job required me to be aggressive and I would rather not be in such environment. I resigned last week and now sitting at home. Questions I have:

1. Should I let employers know Im no longer working at abc company ? Are there any negative consequences of not having a job while job hunting?
2. what should I say about leaving the previous employer ? I dont have any legit excuse and I know its bad to badmouth previous employer.

thanks in advance !
