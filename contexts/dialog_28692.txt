WES: We can't just leave him. He'll run back to his outfit, report our position...
EPPS: You said he was a deserter.
WES: That's what he says. He could be a spy, or something.
EPPS: You don't know that.
WES: You don't know he isn't.
JAEGER: So we'll take him with us. At least 'til we get back to the Hummer.
WES: He'd just slow us down, and drink our water. And if we ran into any more Iraqis you know he'd sell us out.
