How to figure out your ideal job/career in your 30s?
(Apologies for any formatting issues from mobile)

So a bit of background to understand where I’m at before I go into my big question:

-Located in NYC, USA

-Degree in economics (BA)

-Worked for the same company (Fortune 100 CPG/food goods company) since graduation - 8 years now

-Occupied several roles starting from customer service to sales operations to project management

-Current role is a project manager with a primary focus on process improvement and business operations projects, almost all strictly internal-facing and all strongly cross-departmental as I sit in a sales/commercial team

-Very safe company to work for with pretty good benefits (8/10) but the growth outlook and upward mobility is low

My main issue now is that I’m not happy in this PM role and I feel like every day I’m going to work just to burn 8 hours. My motivation for the role and the company’s mission is near zero. I keep find myself being pessimistic about everything and avoiding any participation during meetings so that I don’t take on any extra work or get assigned to any task forces. My project list is never ending and even if I worked at 110% efficiency the demands will never slow down. 

In terms of my work performance, prior to starting this role I had been a “rock star” employee, getting promoted every 18-24 months and taking on significant new responsibilities to help drive the customer service and sales operations teams toward supporting our sales goals. 18 months ago we restructured our department and in the reorganization the sales operations team was absorbed into another unit of the company that I had no interest in being a part of. I was offered this role of being a PM and leading the restructuring project but I was in way over my head and since the project involved a lot of sensitive HR points I was kept out of the loop of several key decisions from the executive level team and I was left trying to decipher why decisions were made that didn’t make any sense to me in terms of processes and personnel allocations. There were no other options for a next role at the time and I had a minor interest in being a PM so I accepted the assignment. 

Now we’re here and I hate the idea of working in this role any longer. The problem is that I don’t know what to do next. I’m not sure if I hate project management or just project management at my current company. I’m already studying for the PMP certificate since I feel it would help “close the chapter” on the past 18 months and I feel that would help show I accomplished something from this misery. In terms of other roles I’ve always liked the analytical side of my roles but I’m not sure if analytics is a role I would enjoy as the responsibilities vary from company to company. I’m also very uninterested in my current industry (consumer packages goods) and taking a leap to something more STEM related that I find interesting would be a challenge I’m assuming. To sum it up I’m confused about what to do next and get frustrated when I try to start the process of figuring this out. 

Where I need help is figuring out what to do next and what roles might be a good lead to start searching. I’ve read through the BoL resources and tried doing a few google searches on figuring out my “perfect” job but most of those quizzes either seem like junk or charge a fee to get results. If anyone has been in a similar situation I’d like to hear how you got thru this as well.
