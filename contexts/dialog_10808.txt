PROSECUTOR: So, Dr. Venkman, please explain to the court why it is you and your co-defendants took it upon yourselves to dig a big hole in the middle of the street.
VENKMAN: Seventy-seventh and First Avenue has so many holes already we didn't think anyone would notice.
JUDGE: Keep that up, mister, and I'll find you in contempt.
VENKMAN: Sorry, your Honor, but when somebody sets me up like that I can't resist.
PROSECUTOR: I'll ask you again, Dr. Venkman. Why were you digging the hole? And please remember that you're under oath.
VENKMAN: I had my fingers crossed when they swore me in, but I'm going to tell you the truth. There are things in this world that go way beyond human understanding, things that can't be explained and that most people don't want to know about anyway. That's where we come in.
PROSECUTOR: So what are you saying? That the world of the supernatural is your special province?
VENKMAN: No, I guess I'm just saying that shit happens and somebody has to deal with it.
