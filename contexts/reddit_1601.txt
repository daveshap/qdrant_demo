Are you seriously simping for the UC schools right now?
Bro, what the fuck, she charged you $70 just to ask her out? And you actually paid it.

Dude, actually though, what the fuck, you DM'ed 4 paragraphs about why you two would be perfect together, and she doesn't even know who you are? Actually bro, you're simping to the max.

Dude really, stop refreshing the portal and go to bed. She's left you on read since November. She isn't into you. Besides, she's talking to 100,000 other applicants.

Anyway in all seriousness I'm pretty nervous for my UC decisions, just hoping I get into Santa Cruz. Hope y'all get in where you want!
