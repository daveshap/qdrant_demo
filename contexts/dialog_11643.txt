DEBI: I just play my own collection.
MARTIN: It's nice to see you again.
MARTIN: How long has it been?
DEBI: Since you stood me up on prom night and vanished without saying a word?
MARTIN: Ten years, I think. What I miss?
DEBI: Well, let me see... they tore down the George Orwell monument and put up a bust of George Michael. Main Street's a four-laner, no left turns four to seven. I was married and divorced. And Grosse Pointe is now officially the new sister city to Lower Hutt, New Zealand. We have fiber-optic town meetings every two months.
MARTIN: Here is now there. There is here.
