how to connect C wire for ecobee lite to Weil-McLain EG Series-5 gas steam boiler I want to upgrade from a battery powered Honeywell thermostat to an ecobee3 lite.This is for heat only.My current Honeywell has two wires: Red and White. Missing is the C cable.There are enough wires in the cable in the wall they are just not connected.The transformer on the boiler has the following terminals:Y     WGC     RCurrently the red cable from the thermostat is connected to G.The white cable from the thermostat is connected to Y.Question: Where do I connect my 'c-cable' ? Is this a question of just connecting that one cable or would the entire transformer need to somehow re-wired ?
