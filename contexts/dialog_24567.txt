OSGOOD: Just a moment, miss - May I?
JERRY: Help yourself.
OSGOOD: I am Osgood Fielding the Third.
JERRY: I am Cinderella the Second.
OSGOOD: If there is one thing I admire, it's a girl with a shapely ankle.
JERRY: Me too. Bye now.
OSGOOD: Let me carry one of the instruments.
JERRY: Thank you. Aren't you a sweetheart?
OSGOOD: It certainly is delightful to have some young blood around here.
JERRY: Personally, I'm Type O.
OSGOOD: You know, I've always been fascinated by show business.
JERRY: You don't say.
OSGOOD: Yes, indeed. It's cost my family quite a bit of money.
JERRY: You invest in shows?
OSGOOD: No - it's showgirls. I've been married seven or eight times.
JERRY: You're not sure?
OSGOOD: Mama is keeping score. Frankly, she's getting rather annoyed with me
JERRY: I'm not surprised.
OSGOOD: So this year, when George White's Scandals opened, she packed me off to Florida. Right now she thinks I'm out there on my yacht - deep-sea fishing.
JERRY: Well, pull in your reel, Mr. Fielding. You're barking up the wrong fish.
OSGOOD: If I promise not to be a naughty boy - how about dinner tonight?
JERRY: Sorry. I'll be on the bandstand.
OSGOOD: Oh, of course. which of these instruments do you play?
JERRY: Bull fiddle.
OSGOOD: Fascinating. Do you use a bow or do you just pluck it?
JERRY: Most of the time I slap it.
OSGOOD: You must be quite a girl.
JERRY: Wanna bet?
OSGOOD: My last wife was an acrobatic dancer - you know, sort of a contortionist - she could smoke a cigarette while holding it between her toes - Zowie! - but Mama broke it up.
JERRY: Why?
OSGOOD: She doesn't approve of girls who smoke.
JERRY: Goodbye, Mr. Fielding.
OSGOOD: Goodbye?
JERRY: This is where I get off.
OSGOOD: Oh, you don't get off that easy.
