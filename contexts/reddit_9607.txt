I’m losing hope in my job search and I don’t know what to do.
This is a throw away account for obvious reasons. I have been job searching in Student Affairs for almost 8 months now and I just got my masters degree. I’ve changed my resume, my interview style, and everything I can think of, and I’m still getting nowhere. Every place I’ve been rejected from has said “your just not the right fit for us” and I’m sick of it. I feel like I have wasted 2 years of my life getting a degree in a field that does not want me. I seriously don’t know if I should keep trying, get some additional help (I’ve used 3 job coaches over the course of 6 months), or just quit higher education altogether and search for some other job. No matter what, I could really use some advice.
