JABEZ: ... and if the final vote shall leave thousands of our fellow citizens and their families in hopeless distress
MARY: That's wonderful language. It would move a stone.
JABEZ: If it would only move old Miser Stevens -- We've still got to pay him.
SHERIFF: Yep -- you can't get around that mortgage. -- I'm sorry, Jabez.
JABEZ: It's all right, Sheriff.
SHERIFF: Wish I could really do something for you. But you know Stevens. He'll throw you off your farm tomorrow if you don't pay him tonight.
JABEZ: Let him try it.
SHERIFF: The law is the law. Good-bye, Mary.
