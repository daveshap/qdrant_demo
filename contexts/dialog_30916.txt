SKIPPER: Why wasn't I made aware of this Bill?
BILL: I didn't know sir.
SKIPPER: It's your job to know. If something goes wrong up there, the other eighteen people aboard can't be wondering if he's gonna do his job or not.
SKIPPER: Swing up, son.
ROBIN: What?
SKIPPER: Up you go. Right now.
SKIPPER: Do you have something to say?
PHIL: No.
SKIPPER: Then keep your mouth shut.
SKIPPER: What's it going to be?
ROBIN: I'm sorry...
SKIPPER: Sorry won't cut it.
