JOE: How do you do, Skye?
SKYE: Oh, I love that. I'm just great. I'm so happy to be here. And I apologize for invading you. And I'm so happy you asked me to. I'm so touched. I know how private you and Sally are.
JOE: Yeah, well, it's just us and a few hundred of our closest friends.
SKYE: When I read your work I felt that you knew me. Women must tell you that. And this one in particular speaks to me, do you know? I am Genna. How many women must tell you that. And the script is wonderful. Wonderful and lean and visual...
JOE: I'm so happy you like it. I'm so relieved you said yes, and I'm really, um, what, thrilled, yes actually, to finally meet you.
SKYE: You're going to be a remarkable director, a brilliant director.
