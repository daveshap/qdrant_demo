Can you remember a time that you felt so in love and now its just this nostalgic feel when you think of it?
I’d just like to hear some stories and other experiences. Here’s one that comes to mind: 

We’d skip school and stay in my room, and it was closer to the summertime so it was hot out. The windows would be open and a really cool, fresh smelling breeze would fill the room while we’d nap. I cant smell a fresh breeze without thinking of that!!

There was one time we danced in the rain at a parking lot. I just felt so different during those times, and it’s indescribable. I feel like I can remember every little detail
