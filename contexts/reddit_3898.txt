Remember; if they don’t make effort when you do...
Don’t give it back regardless of how much you like them in this first phase.

Some people will lead you on & waste your time.

Some people will drag you along without calling it quits then act like nothing happened. Don’t date these people.

Effort is the most attractive trait everyone should have by default. making effort shows to a person that you matter & you respect them even if you’re calling it quits, saying it is STILL effort.

Make sure you make effort in your dates.
Make sure they reciprocate it back.

If they don’t? They are NOT the one for you.
