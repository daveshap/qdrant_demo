UGARTE: One moment. Tonight I'll be selling those for more money than even I have ever dreamed of, and then, addio Casablanca! You know, Rick, I have many friends in Casablanca, but somehow, just because you despise me you're the only one I trust. Will you keep these for me? Please.
RICK: For how long?
UGARTE: Perhaps an hour, perhaps a little longer.
RICK: I don't want them here overnight.
UGARTE: Don't be afraid of that. Please keep them for me. Thank you. I knew I could trust you.
