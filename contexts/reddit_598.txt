Want to be alone at school
Hi, I'm 18 and currently in my last year in school. I have A-levels at the end of the school year which are basically major exams. I'm quite sociable in school, I can pretty much talk to anyone about anything however, lately I've been feeling a bit drained when I've been having conversations with people. I always feel like I'm the one that's initiating conversations and I really can't be bothers to do that anymore. I just feel like being alone at school for a while to kind of "recharge". Just have minimal contact with other people at school and just focus on myself. Is that normal?
