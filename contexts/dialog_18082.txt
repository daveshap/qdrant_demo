NYAH: Sean, there's something I've been meaning to talk to you about... Isn't going to be easy for me to say.
AMBROSE: Then don't say it.
NYAH: I don't know what to do about you, Sean. I'm more than a bit muddled. I need time.
AMBROSE: To do what?
NYAH: Sort it all out.
AMBROSE: And you're going to have time. There's been a change of plans.
NYAH: A change of plans?
AMBROSE: Yes. We won't be able to have dinner tonight. Something's come up. I hope you don't mind.
NYAH: Oh, no, not at all. Maybe just a bit.
AMBROSE: Ulrich will be about. He'll look after you.
NYAH: Lovely.
STAMP: I thought you were going to dinner.
AMBROSE: Hugh, take care of the Nekhorvich memory card.
STAMP: Where is it?
AMBROSE: In the envelope in my pocket. My right.. jacket..pocket..
