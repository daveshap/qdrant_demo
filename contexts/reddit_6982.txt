I think I got fired, but I'm not sure.
TL:DR: My new boss told me I may be getting fired soon, but I haven't received anything formally. I've also lost access to my work emails and the locks to the office have been changed.

I'm not exactly sure where or how to start, but I'm going to do my best to cover as much as I can so it makes sense.

I work in student housing, and the company I work for has operations in multiple states. Each office varies in size depending on the needs of the property, but almost all work and communication with supervisors is done through emails and phone calls. The property I work at is small compared to the rest of the properties so our office staff has always been 4-7 people. My property is also only 2 years old, and most of the office staff has remained the same since before construction was completed.

There was recently a change in management, but all of the staff remained so each property basically just reported to a new corporate team.  This new change was difficult for most of the members of my office, and the team that I had worked for 2 years started quitting one by one. When someone would quit, corporate was quick to replace them with someone from their other properties. I'm now the only employee remaining that's been here from the beginning and all of the new employees constantly ask me questions about the operations of the property. I'm not the property manager, but even the property manager that was brought in asks me questions about the property.

I also live at the property I work at, and two days ago on my day off my manager caught me while I was outside walking my dog. He approached me and told me that while he was working in the office with a corporate manager, they had received an email about "dissolving" my position at the property. That was all of the information that he gave me.  When I asked him if that meant I was fired, he said he didn't know, but that he just wanted to give me the heads up that it was coming. He also told me that they were planning on changing the locks at the end of the business day, so I would no longer have access to the office. After the office closed and everyone went home, I went to the office to see and my keys did not work.

It's been 2 days since this happened, and I've not received a phone call or an email regarding anything about my position in the company. I have also not gone into work, and every time I go to the office it is empty with a note on the door saying to call the mobile office phone for assistance. I've also lost access to all of my work emails and various accounts. I've been fired from a job before, and I had to complete a performance evaluation-esque form to formally terminate the position with the company. I'm not sure what to do and any advice would be greatly appreciated.
