For the over thinkers!
I've seen quite a few threads on here that run along the lines of "I've been texting/just been on a date and the texting has just stopped, am i overthinking or have i been ghosted?". We've all been there, some times its been a day, sometimes you've been firing off messages for 3 hours and suddenly its gone quiet after you said something risky and now your convincing yourself it's all over! Until 5 minutes later they fire back with a laugh crying face and you feel like a moron. So I thought I'd try and help by listing some legitimate reasons you're not getting a reply other then they don't like you. Just to put your mind at rest....

They are convinced they sent the last message and haven't realised you'd replied yet.

They are driving

Their work doesn't allow mobile phones.

Unplanned naps

They attempted to clean their room and have found a new fascination with a useless item they had forgotten about months ago.

They are on a date (No reason they wouldn't be if you met them on a dating site).

They are trying to perfect the dance from single ladies because they finally got round to it.

They have got lost in a Reddit spiral of discovering new Subs.

Their flatmate has started a conversation about the person they are talking too and they busy talking about how much they like you.

Their flatmate has started a conversation about pizza and they busy talking about much they like pizza.

They are having some "Me Time" and it's taking far longer then they had anticipated.

They are trying to seem aloof.

They are writing lists in r/dating and thinking of pithy one liners is taking some time.
