The grass is always greener in OLD!!!
I'm just venting but what I've discovered is most people online are always under the illusion that they can find better. They never wanna commit to an actual person (seeing one person on a regular basis) and just wanna go with the flow to see their options. Well fuck that! I'm not a fucking disposable thing to consider only if options A&B called out! Either you wanna be with me or you don't. Either you're interested or you're not. It's not that complicated.
