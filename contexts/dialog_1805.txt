DOBISCH: Hiya, Buddy-boy. I'm in this bar on Sixty-first Street -- and I got to thinking about you -- and I figured I'd give you a little buzz.
BUD: Well, that's very nice of you -- but who is this?
DOBISCH: Dobisch -- Joe Dobisch, in Administration.
BUD: Oh, yes, Mr. Dobisch. I didn't recognize your voice --
DOBISCH: That's okay, Buddy-boy. Now like I was saying, I'm in this joint on Sixty-first -- and I think I got lucky -- -- she's a skater with the Ice Show -- -- and I thought maybe I could bring her up for a quiet drink.
BUD: I'm sorry, Mr. Dobisch. You know I like to help you guys out -- but it's sort of late -- so why don't we make it some other time?
DOBISCH: Buddy-boy -- she won't keep that long -- not even on ice. Listen, kid, I can't pass this up -- she looks like Marilyn Monroe.
BUD: I don't care if it is Marilyn Monroe -- I'm already in bed -- and I've taken a sleeping pill -- so I'm afraid the answer is no.
DOBISCH: Look, Baxter -- we're making out the monthly efficiency rating -- and I'm putting you in the top ten. Now you don't want to louse yourself up, do you?
BUD: Of course not. But -- how can I be efficient in the office if I don't get enough sleep at night?
DOBISCH: It's only eleven -- and I just want the place for forty-five minutes.
BLONDE: I'm getting lonely. Who are you talking to, anyway?
DOBISCH: My mother.
BLONDE: That's sweet. That's real sweet.
DOBISCH: Make it thirty minutes. What do you say, Bud?
BUD: I'm all out of liquor -- and there's no clean glasses -- no cheese crackers -- no nothing.
DOBISCH: Let me worry about that. Just leave the key under the mat and clear out.
BUD: Yes, Mr. Dobisch.
