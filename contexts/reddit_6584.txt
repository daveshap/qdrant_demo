Joined a sinking ship?
Hello!

I recently accepted a position at a company that is not doing so well. This is my first position after College/Internship. Its been a little over a month, and there have been a couple of red flags.

-Constant replacement of CEOs in the last four years. I wanna say 4-5 different ones.

-A majority of managers and supervisors in my department haven't been employed with the company for more than a couple of years, if that. Our  director has been with us for six months. Other positions vary from region to region. I keep hearing a couple months in the higher level positions.

-Many of our regional leadership are leaving the organization. In my area alone we've lost major HR leaders and managers. Even my direct boss is leaving, which worries me even more because they were heavily involved in creating my position.

-Talks of selling to competitors. I've been hearing rumors that the organization is looking to sell, though it has not been successful getting fair market value. Even if they do sell, I could be laid off due to the fact that other companies outsource positions similar to mine.

-Closures, layoffs, and loss of business. Facilities have been losing many contracts, and thus have had to layoff staff and close smaller facilities.

I am not looking to quit. I am really getting into my role, and I even received praise from many of my leaders.

I am not sure what to do if I end up losing this job in the near future. My job search was a very tiring experience. I did do some research, but there wasn't anything that made me want to not accept the role.

Really just looking for some advice.
