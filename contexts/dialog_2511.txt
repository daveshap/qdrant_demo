SHADOW: This is the copy of Swayzak's manning report that was released. Everybody on this job knows it's bullshit but we could never argue with the numbers. They're all airtight.
BRIAN: Yeah? Airtight?
BRIAN: I've got three different drafts of the same report -- with different numbers that're all over the place. Looks like they were just making it up as they went along.
SHADOW: Did a little check on the consulting firm that wrote the report. They did exactly one job -- Swayzak's manpower study. It's not even really a company. No employees, no directors, just a PO Box.
BRIAN: Then who wrote the report?
SHADOW: It had to be someone who knows numbers. Some kind of fancy accountant. But what's the connection?
