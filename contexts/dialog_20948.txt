PRESIDENT: Let it be clear at the outset that all matters pertaining to this inquiry are confidential, and anyone discussing them outside this chamber will be held in contempt of the Tribunal. You may proceed, Dr. Honorius.
ZIRA: By your leave, Mr. President -- the Tribunal has not yet defined the purpose of this inquiry.
MAXIMUS: You asked for the opportunity to present your case. Surely you must know why you're here.
ZIRA: My own purpose is to save this exceptional creature from mutilation.
MAXIMUS: And our purpose is to settle custodial and jurisdictional questions concerning this beast, and determine what's to be done with him.
ZIRA: At the very least, this man has the right to know whether there's a charge against him.
HONORIUS: Objection. The accused is indeed a man. Therefore, he has no rights under ape law.
PRESIDENT: Well, Dr. Zira? This is a man, is he not?
