I'm just not doing well and I always have to lie about it, even to myself
I gained twenty pounds this year. My uncle thinks it might be the antidepressant I'm taking. (I'm on lithium, klonopin, celexa and haldol).  I look awful. I'm 4'10" so twenty pounds is a lot. Everybody noticed at my family's BBQ for the fourth. My great aunt asked me if I'm pregnant. 

I'm unemployed. It's a sad story. I got into school for my masters in speech pathology, but I didn't have the prerequisites. So I took them and applied again a year later. Except this time, I didn't get in to any of the schools I applied to, even the two I had gotten into before. Besides, I'm not even sure I have the drive or passion for speech pathology. I have an undergraduate degree so I should be able to get a job, right?

Well, I graduated two years ago and I have no job experience. I can't apply to school because I have no references (you need three).

The only bright spot in my life is my boyfriend, but he's unemployed too. He never graduated college so his earning potential is limited. 

I'm twenty-five and I feel like a failure.
