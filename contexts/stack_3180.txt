Which symphony does Artemis Fowl listen to increase his thinking capacity while planning his next move? I remember that at one point, to make a counter-move in an ongoing plot, Artemis closes himself in a room and makes lot of arrangements with Butler's help to let his brain function at maximum. One of the things he does is listen to a music record. It was either Mozart or Beethoven. I wanted to know the exact song.
