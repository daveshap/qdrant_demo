It hasn’t been this bad in a long time.
I’m feeling down. And I keep letting myself fall down the rabbit hole of despair, nostalgia, and fear. I suddenly realized there’s this giant void and nothing can help it anymore. I miss things. People. Who I used to be. What life used to look like. Nothing seems to matter anymore. I’m getting therapy set up this week, but I just need as much help as possible. 

Thanks friends
