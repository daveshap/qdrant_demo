BINGY: Well, Stew, that's all thrashed out. By golly, I'm surely glad to see that you're not really sore. You know our racket - after all, news is news.
STEW: Sure, sure. That's all right. That was a great story, Bingy. A great story - wish I'd printed it.
BINGY: I gave you the breaks, didn't I? That hairy chest story!
STEW: You've raised it up to the chin, I see. Go on in the other room and get yourself a drink.
STEW: You know what I should do with you? I should sock you right in that funny little nose.
GALLAGHER: Yes - and I'd love it.
