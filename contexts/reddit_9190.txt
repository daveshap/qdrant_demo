Been a month I stopped smoking and I still have money in the bank 'till next paycheck.
I paid 23$ a day for 2 packs of smoke. 23$...bucks...a...day. After 4 weeks, it's more than 600$ i would have spent on it.

Proud to be out that unhealthy and pricey habit !

*Edit : For those wondering, I'm from Quebec, Canada ! :) This is why it may look expensive for some of you, I don't know if it's about the same price in the U.S or else ? Here I was at 11.50$ a pack.*
