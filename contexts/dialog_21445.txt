GRANDFATHER: I brought you a special present.
THE KID: What is it?
GRANDFATHER: Open it up.
THE KID: A book?
GRANDFATHER: That's right. When I was your age, television was called books. And this is a special book. It was the book my father used to read to me when I was sick, and I used to read it to your father. And today, I'm gonna read it to you.
THE KID: Has it got any sports in it?
