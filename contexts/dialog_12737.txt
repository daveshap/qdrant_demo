DUPONT: Not so scared.
KNIGHT: Perhaps not. You seem to have misplaced a private. No doubt by now his head is stranger to his neck.
DUPONT: No doubt.
KNIGHT: You surprise me. Eliminating a rival like that. Such are the actions of a man of conquest. I was mistaken. 300 years have turned the boy's fear into ambit- ion.
DUPONT: You're wrong.
KNIGHT: I know you very well, Conor MacLeod. And I can see the truth beginning to make itself clear to you. Mulet, Romirez, they were fools without vision. It was destined that the board would be cleared for the real players.
DUPONT: Romirez understood. Not you.
KNIGHT: Romirez is dust.
KNIGHT: Finish your prayers?
DUPONT: Finish yours?
KNIGHT: Our common heritage. I am your only real friend, you know. The only one who truly understands you. I look forward to the day we meet again. And I kill you.
DUPONT: So sure?
