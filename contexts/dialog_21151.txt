BETTY: There isn't one.. That anyone would believe. I went for a walk after dinner, down to the ocean...alone... I came up and went to bed. I didn't sleep very well. Then there was a thunderstorm. And it began to rain. I went across to close the French door. That's the first time I saw him out there.
BRANDON: He got in here how?
BETTY: Not with my consent, strange as it seems. I don't know how he got in. I don't know anything.
