ROSE: How you doing?
JIMMY: I'm drinking.
ROSE: Slowly or quickly?
JIMMY: As fast as I can.
ROSE: Come home soon after the show.
JIMMY: I went to see her -- some fuckin' asshole answers the door in his underwear, he's fifty years old, there's coke and shit laid out on the table --
ROSE: -- did she talk to you?
JIMMY: She went crazy. She went crazy, Rose.
ROSE: Did you tell her?
JIMMY: I don't know. I have to go, I don't have time and I have more drinking to do before I go march --
ROSE: I love you.
JIMMY: Love you too..
ROSE: Bye.
