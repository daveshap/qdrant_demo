MARIA: You promised to come for tea yesterday. I waited for so long.
GEORGE: I'm sorry. I haven't even got any cigarettes left!
MARIA: I'll make some for you! You will come today?
GEORGE: Perhaps.
MARIA: Please say you will. The days are so very long and lonely without you. Please . . .
GEORGE: All right, I'll be there.
MARIA: Thank you.
GEORGE: You'll tell me some of the things I want to know, won't you? You'll tell me who runs this place. And why we were kidnapped. And what they're going to do with us!
