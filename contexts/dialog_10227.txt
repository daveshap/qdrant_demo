JACOB: What's this stuff?
SETH: My guess is that this little dive's been feeding on nomad road waifs like bikers and truckers for a longtime. This is probably some of the shipments they stole off the trucks.
JACOB: Well, I say lets tear this place apart for weapons. So when they burst through that door, we'll make 'em wish they never did.
SETH: I don't give a shit about living or dying anymore. I just want to send as many of these devils back to hell as I can.
JACOB: Amen.
