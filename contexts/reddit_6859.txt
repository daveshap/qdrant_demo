Seeking Advice: My company is based in travel, just slashed my salary by 25% for 4 months, and has laid off people in other departments. Is it time to start looking?
It can be hard to motivate yourself to seek change.  I'm an accountant and a Financial Analyst.  

My company now isn't the best in terms of culture, but I've learned what I do and I'm just chilling there. The pay isn't great, but it isn't bad either.

I'm working by Wall Street in NYC.

Do I now look out? Or am I being delusional by praying that this Covid19 nonsense will end in a month and my company can be saved?

It's really complacency and fear at this point for me, I've only been at this new job 4-5 months! But its going to fail if people don't travel!
