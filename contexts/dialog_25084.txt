VON SCHERBACH: Good evening, Sergeants. A bit dank in here, isn't it?... Where is the Baracken-Fuehrer?
HOFFY: Yes, sir.
VON SCHERBACH: You have a Lieutenant here...
VON SCHERBACH: ...a Lieutenant James Dunbar?
HOFFY: Yes, sir.
DUNBAR: I am Lieutenant Dunbar.
VON SCHERBACH: What is your number?
DUNBAR: 105-353.
VON SCHERBACH: That is correct. Lieutenant Dunbar, I came to apologize for the accommodations. Ordinarily, of course, we never put officers up with enlisted men.
DUNBAR: I'll live.
VON SCHERBACH: Quite a transportation jam we are having outside of Frankfurt! They are very angry in Berlin. They will be even angrier on the East Front, waiting for that ammunition train. Don't you think so, Lieutenant?
DUNBAR: I don't know what you're talking about, Colonel.
VON SCHERBACH: Of course you don't. Now, Lieutenant, how would you like to join me in my quarters? I have a nice fire going.
DUNBAR: I'm okay here. Why bother?
VON SCHERBACH: No bother. I'm very grateful for a little company. You see, I suffer from insomnia.
DUNBAR: Ever try forty sleeping pills?
VON SCHERBACH: Abfuehren!
HOFFY: Wait a minute. We have some rights here. Why is this man being taken out?
VON SCHERBACH: Curtains would do wonders for this barrack. You will not get them.
BAGRADIAN: How did he ever find out about that ammunition train?
HOFFY: You must have shot off your mouth all the way from Frankfurt to here.
BAGRADIAN: We did not.
PRICE: Maybe just a hint or so. Think hard.
BAGRADIAN: I don't have to think. We didn't tell anything to anybody. Not a word. Not until we hit this barrack.
