MATTHEW: I'll tell you another thing. We might have led the world once into the Industrial Revolution, now we lead with television commercials. We're the best, it's as simple as that. Even the Americans will admit it now ... the camera work, the acting, the scripts, special effects. We've got the lot. Nearly all the good directors here have ambitions to make serious films. That food you're eating.
JAMES: Yes.
MATTHEW: What would you call it?
JAMES: I dunno. Ploughman's Lunch.
MATTHEW: Ploughman's Lunch. Traditional English fare.
JAMES: U-huh.
