Overheard two coworkers spouting anti-vax BS, I wanted to go off on them but didn’t. It makes me so angry that people would spread lies like that.
One told the other that she “read that some guy got paralyzed after getting the MMR vaccine, I will NEVER vaccinate my kids. The propaganda you see about vaccines is ridiculous, it’s all them wanting to make money”.

This was from a woman in her 40’s with two kids. The other agreed.
