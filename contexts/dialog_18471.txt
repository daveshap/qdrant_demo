WALTER: Yes, sir.
LONGFELLOW: What's that?
WALTER: A Prairie Oyster, sir.[10]
LONGFELLOW: Prairie? Oysters?
WALTER: Yes, sir. It makes the head feel smaller.
LONGFELLOW: Oh. Oh! Has Miss Dawson called yet?
WALTER: Miss Dawson, sir? No, sir. No Miss Dawson has called, sir.
LONGFELLOW: She was a lady in distress. She wouldn't let me help her. Got a lot of pride. I like that.
WALTER: Oh, I do too, sir.
LONGFELLOW: I'd better call her up and apologize. I don't remember taking her home last night.
WALTER: I'd venture to say, sir, you don't remember much of anything that happened last night, sir.
LONGFELLOW: What do you mean? I remember everything! Hand me my pants - I wrote her phone number on a piece of paper.
WALTER: You have no pants, sir.
WALTER: You came home last night - without them.
LONGFELLOW: I did what!
WALTER: As a matter of fact, you came home without any clothes. You were in your - uh - shorts. Yes, sir.
LONGFELLOW: Oh, don't be silly, Walter. I couldn't walk around in the streets without any clothes. I'd be arrested.
WALTER: That's what the two policemen said, sir.
LONGFELLOW: What two policemen?
WALTER: The ones who brought you home, sir. They said you and another gentleman kept walking up and down the streets, shouting: Back to nature! Clothes are a blight on civilization! Back to nature!""
