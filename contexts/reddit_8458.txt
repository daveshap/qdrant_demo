How does Bernie Sanders' jobs guarantee proposal compare to other countries' active labor market policies?
Recently, US Senator and [former Presidential candidate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders_presidential_campaign,_2016) Bernie Sanders proposed a policy whereby the [US Government would guarantee a job paying $15/hr plus health insurance to anyone who wanted one.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2018/04/23/bernie-sanders-to-unveil-plan-to-guarantee-every-american-a-job/?utm_term=.12a6074c522d)  Per the proposal: "Under the job guarantee, every American would be entitled to a job under one of these projects or receive job training to be able to do so, according to an early draft of the proposal."

In many other OECD countries, [the government runs various "active labor market" policies around job training and subsidized employment schemes.  These are as contrasted to passive labor market policies which provide cash assistance (e.g. unemployment insurance and disability insurance) without trying to match particular persons to particular jobs.](https://www.kansascityfed.org/Publicat/EconRev/PDF/11q3Nie-Struby.pdf)  

 Do any other countries, especially peer countries with high wage levels, operate now or previously operate active labor market policies anything like what Sanders is proposing?  If so,  what has their track record been?
