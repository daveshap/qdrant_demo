Unpopular opinion: don’t blame your good grades for your lack of a social life
I said what I said. 

“I never went to a party or ate food with friends for longer than 39 seconds or looked at a a girl BECAUSE I WAS SO FOCUSED”

You guys. 

Be real.

Don’t be ashamed of your awkward self. Some of y’all don’t have social skills because you’re not social, not because you tried hard in school. 

It’s so annoying to see this narrative of people feeling like they missed out on high school because they tried so hard at school. This isn’t real. You were weird or awkward or lacked any romantic finesse with the opposite/desires sex.

You’ll get into a good school, enroll, and then continue to be awkward. This won’t change. You are who you are. Embrace it. 

In a way, this should be comforting. Your lack of a social life is your own fault. Don’t blame your academic success on your miserable high school years. So if you don’t get into a good school, don’t mourn your lost high school experiences; you wouldn’t have had them anyway.
