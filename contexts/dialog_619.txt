AUDREY: Of course, John.
GRANDFATHER: Yes, they were playing the queues outside the picture palaces of Liverpool. Scruffy young lads, lacking even the price of a jam roll. Orphans, every Paddy's son of 'em. I saw their potential at once although I had me doubts about the little fella, a savage primitive, that Ringo, but it was him what gave in first. He picked up a brick and heaved it at me and I quelled him wid one fierce flash of me eyes. Mister
AUDREY: The usual ten per cent?
GRANDFATHER: Oh, not at all, I let them have twenty-five; sure aren't there four of them?

SHAKE: He can't be far.
JOHN: I hope he fell off.

RINGO: He doesn't like me, honest, I can tell ... It's 'cos I'm little.
GEORGE: You've got an inferiority complex, you have.
RINGO: Yeah, I know, that's why I took up the drums. It's me active compensatory factor.
GEORGE: Are you going in?
RINGO: No, she'll only reject me in the end and I'll be frustrated.
GEORGE: You never know, you might be lucky this time.
RINGO: No, I know the psychological pattern and it plays hell with me drum skins.
