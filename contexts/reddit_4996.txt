Most likely will be laid off tomorrow. I can't go through this again. I just can't.
Have been struggling to rebuild my life after my first layoff in 2016. Finally got a job I love in my industry last November. Today layoffs were announced. I was the last hired so will likely be laid off tomorrow. I owe tens of thousands to credit cards that I have been partially living off since my first layoff, plus student loans, plus 25K in penalties to the IRS for taking money from my IRA to pay my mortgage. My industry is fucked and I will not be finding another job that pays over minimum wage. I dont think I can handle this again. I am not strong enough.
