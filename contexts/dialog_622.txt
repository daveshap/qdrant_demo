PAUL: All right, how about Ringo? I mean ... he's very upset, you know ... and as far as your girlfriend, little Audrey's concerned, she's finished with men for the rest of her natural, and another thing ...
GRANDFATHER: A harmless bit of fun, aah, none of you have any sense of humour left these days.
PAUL: Oh, it's all right for you but those two girls were scared to death! Honest, Grandad, why? I mean, why do you do these things?
GRANDFATHER: You're left-handed, aren't you, Paul?
PAUL: Yeah ... so what?
GRANDFATHER: Why do you always use your left hand?
PAUL: Well, don't be daft, I've got to.
GRANDFATHER: And I take a left-handed view of life, I've got to.
