Controlling Robin's neutral attack combo: Arcfire or Elwind In the third strike of Robin's neutral attack, it is either a fire attack that uses up Arcfire charges, or a wind flurry attack that uses Elwind charges.Given that there are sufficient charges of both tomes, is the outcome of the third strike random? I've been trying to choose one over the other consistently by testing with simultaneous directional inputs but I can't seem to control when I get Arcfire and when I get Elwind. How can I control the output?
