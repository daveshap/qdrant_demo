I lost an hour this morning and I don't know why.
I woke up this morning around 8:45 and checked my phone at 8:56.  A massive, awful headache came on, a high-pitched "EEEEEEEEEEEEEEE" filled my ears, and everything got brighter, almost to a white color.  I nurse my headache for a few minutes before I leave for work, and what felt like 5 minutes later, I check my phone for the time, and it's 9:53.  

I lost almost an hour of time in the migraine, and I have no clue how that happened or what happened in that hour.  I don't know if this has happened before.  And this is in combination with the fact that I've been getting my friends' names wrong, and my brain has been spelling words wrong more consistently than normal.

I'm kind of scared right now.  I don't know what's going on, and I don't know what to do now, or if I have to do anything now.

**EDIT:**  Thanks to you all for your concern.  I'm already feeling significantly better than I did this morning.  I went to campus health services an hour ago.  She poked and prodded, then told me it was probably a migraine.  This is the first migraine I've ever actually had.  She said that the lost hour can be explained by it.  She said Advil + a little caffeine + rest would probably make me feel a hell of a lot better, but that it may not go away entirely for up to 48 hours.  If the Advil (and once the Advil wears off, Alleve) don't do anything for me, or if it gets worse again, I'll have someone bring me to the urgent care center near our school.  

Thanks so much for your responses.  You guys snapped me out of "What the hell just happened to me, let's put everything back to normal" and into the "Let's figure out what's going on and get it fixed" mode.
