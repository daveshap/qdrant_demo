JABEZ: I think his leg is broken.
MARY: Oh, Jabez.
JABEZ: Yep.
JABEZ: I remember Dad used to say sometimes, when they were handing out hard luck, the farmers got there first.
MARY: Jabez, don't you remember your own wedding? We said it's for better or worse. We said it's for richer or poorer.
JABEZ: That's what we said.
MA STONE: There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright
JABEZ: Consarn the consarn --
MA STONE: Jabez! What kind of talk is that for the Sabbath? And me a-reading the holy word!
JABEZ: Sorry, Ma -- but this consar-- this little pig -- He won't let me fix him --
MARY: He's stubborn as a Stone.
JABEZ: Hold the splint tighter -- it's almost done. Go on reading, Ma. This man, Job, he had troubles, didn't he?
MA STONE: You know that, son.
JABEZ: Hard luck -- like me.
MA STONE: Now, Jabez Stone -- as for what you're calling hard luck -- well, we made New England out of it. That and codfish.
JABEZ: That's right, Ma -- we ain't licked yet. A Stone's never licked till he's dead -- that's what Dad used to say, didn't he, Ma?
JABEZ: There! Guess that ought to hold good. Put him down here, by the fire, Mary. But we don't want to get him too close -- we'll have roast pork for supper.
MA STONE: Not on the Sabbath you won't, Jabez!
