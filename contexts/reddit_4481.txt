My only pleasure in life is sleep, because we’re temporarily dead - Please show me some direction in my life
FUCK this life, why me, why us, why did we get dealt this shitty hand in life. 

I just want to be set free, all this pain to be over with once and for all and to find the love of my life.

The past two years have been hell on earth for me, everything is so difficult and the fruits of life have already died for me because I’ve been trying to reach them for years!!!
