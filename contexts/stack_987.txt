Libreoffice Writer: How to flip/swap between two table rows? I use latest LibreOffice Writer and I have a table with 4 rowsI want to flip/swap between the two middlish rows (row 2 and row 3).That is, I want that row 3 will take the place of row 2 (or vice versa).How can this be done automatically without manually copy-pasting the data from cell to cell (and then deleting the old data)?The rows I work with are multi-columned (2 or more columns, so just dragging all data from one row to another isn't possible and will result in the dragging of just one particular cell from a set of cells).UpdateIf possible, I'd prefer a way that doesn't involve creating a third line to which we move the data (and then delete the original).In other words I'll prefer a solution which is pure swapping or shall I say \"replacing\".
