SCOOBY: No, not really.
MR. DEMARCO: Any books you like to read for fun?
SCOOBY: No.
MR. DEMARCO: None at all? How about those 'underground' comics?
SCOOBY: I hate reading.
MR. DEMARCO: All right, Scooby, let's not beat around the bush. With your attitude, you're not going to get in anywhere.
SCOOBY: OK.
MR. DEMARCO: 'OK.' So you just don't care. Let me ask you, not as your guidance counselor, but...as a friend: what do you want to do with your life? I mean, what kind of long-term goals can you possibly have?
SCOOBY: I dunno...
MR. DEMARCO: C'mon. Talk to me. Tell me what you're thinking.
SCOOBY: Well, I mean...I wanna be on TV. Maybe have a talk show or something. Like Conan. Or early Letterman.
MR. DEMARCO: Ah-hah. And how is it you hope to achieve this goal?
SCOOBY: I dunno. See if I have any connections.
