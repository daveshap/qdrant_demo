Automatic route deleting in a specific network I'm on Ubuntu 18.04 and I try to learn more on netplan.When I'm in school's network I need to access to the LAN but I don't want my internet traffic goes by their gateway. I can connect to network by both ethernet ( enp0s25 ) and wifi ( wlp2s0 ). I can identify school's network by domain ( school.example ) and the gateway IP never changes. Does it exist a way to automatically delete the default route when system detects the school's network ? Thanks for your help! Nonot
