I wish boys were allowed to be feminine without being judged.
I’m a feminine guy and I just want to express it when I’m at school. The judgement that I get is too much to bear and the only thing that I can get away with is a flower in my hair, and even then I get a few insults hurled at me. I would do much more if I wasn’t judged. I can’t express who I am to the world and have to bottle it up.

I fucking hate this. This is just a minor point in the many reasons I just want to kill myself.
