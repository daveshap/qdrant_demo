upgrade to 16.04 from 14.04 computer jammed in middle computer jammed solid half way through download. had to switch off and on. now terminal asks for my password for 14.04, but it won't accept it. so i've ended up with a computer which won't work. how do i get my computer working? i'd be happy to go back to 14.04, but how? i can't get into my computer to do anything. i'm not literate in terminal use!
