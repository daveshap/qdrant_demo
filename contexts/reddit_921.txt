If you felt awkward today, I want to congratulate you...
For trying your best.

For making the phone call.

For answering the phone.

For not staying at home.

For putting in the effort.

For trying something new.

For reaching out.

For asking for what you want.

For taking a risk, any risk at all.

It may seem like a failure today, but these little experiences will pay dividends in your future. Donâ€™t give up!
