HEAD WAITER: Good evening.
MELVIN: Hi. You have hard shells, right?
CAROL: Stop asking everyone.
MELVIN: Just him and that's it. Okay, you can answer -- we've worked it out.
HEAD WAITER: Yes, we do... And I can give you a tie and jacket.
MELVIN: What?
HEAD WAITER: They require a tie and jacket but we have some available.
MELVIN: No... I'm not wearing that -- and just in case you were going to ask I'm not going to let you inject me with plaque either.
CAROL: You promised a nice place -- can't you just... You have these dry cleaned all the time, don't you?
HEAD WAITER: Actually, I don't think so.
MELVIN: Wait here.
