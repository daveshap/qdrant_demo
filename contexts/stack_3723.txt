When should an F-test be one sided vs two sided? If we increase both numerator and denominator degrees of freedom of the F distribution, then the pdf narrows down on the value 1. This suggests that a two-sided test is reasonable: If we have high degrees of freedom, then finding e.g. our test statistic $F=0.034$ is extremely unlikely: not only high, but also low values are unlikely in this case. Yet I have so far not yet a textbook use a two sided test of the F test. Instead, we reject the null hypothesis only when the test statistic is very large.Why don\u2019t textbooks use a two sided test?When is a two sided test reasonable for the F test, and when is a one sided test reasonable?
