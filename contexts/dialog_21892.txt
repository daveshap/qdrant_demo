LISA: All day long I've tried to keep my mind on work.
JEFF: Thinking about Thorwald?
LISA: And you, and you friend Doyle -- Did you hear from him again -- since he left?
JEFF: Not a word. He was going to check on the railroad station, and the trunk. He must be still on it.
JEFF: Something on your mind, Lisa?
LISA: It doesn't make sense to me.
JEFF: What doesn't?
LISA: Women aren't that unpredictable.
JEFF: Lisa -- I can't guess what you're thinking.
LISA: A woman has a favorite handbag -- it always hangs on her bedpost where she can get at it. Then she takes a trip and leaves it behind. Why?
JEFF: Because she didn't know she was going on a trip -- and where she was going she wouldn't need a handbag.
LISA: But only her husband would know that. And the jewelry! Women don't keep all their jewelry in a purse, all tangled, getting scratched and twisted up.
JEFF: Do they hide it in their husband's clothes?
LISA: They do not! And they don't leave it behind them. A woman going anywhere but the hospital would always take makeup, perfume and jewelry.
JEFF: Inside stuff?
LISA: Basic equipment. You don't leave it behind in your husband's drawer in your favorite handbag.
JEFF: I'm with you, sweetie, but Detective Thomas J. Doyle has a pat answer for that.
LISA: That Mrs. Thorwald left at six ayem yesterday with her husband?
JEFF: That's what the witnesses told him.
LISA: Well, I have a pat rebuttal for Mr. Doyle -- that couldn't be Mrs. Thorwald -- or I don't know women.
JEFF: Still -- those witnesses.
LISA: We'll agree they saw a woman -- but she wasn't Mrs. Thorwald. -- That is, yet.
