HUDSUCKER: ...Jesus Christopher -- That smarts... Where was I? Oh yeah, the board. I guess Sidney's been puttin' the screws to ya, huh, Norman?
NORVILLE: Norville.
HUDSUCKER: Mm. Well, say what you like about the man's ethics, he's a balls-to- the-wall businessman. Beat ya any way he can. Straight for the jugular. Very effective.
NORVILLE: Yes sir...
HUDSUCKER: Anyway. Any particular reason you didn't give him my Blue Letter? I mean, Jesus, Norman, just a dying man's last words and wishes, no big deal.
NORVILLE: Huh? Oh, geez, Mr. Hudsucker, I apologize, there was an awful lot of excitement and I guess I must've mislaid --
HUDSUCKER: It's sittin' in your apron pocket, right where you left it. Imbecile.
NORVILLE: Oh, geez.
HUDSUCKER: Failure to deliver a Blue Letter is grounds for dismissal.
NORVILLE: Geez, I --
HUDSUCKER: Ah, it's New Year's, I'm not gonna add to your woes. I'm just saying.
NORVILLE: Yessir.
HUDSUCKER: Well, why don't ya read it.
NORVILLE: Sir?
HUDSUCKER: Yeah, go ahead. Might learn somethin'.
NORVILLE: Yes sir...
NORVILLE: 'From the desk of Waring Hudsucker. To. Sidney J. Mussburger. Regarding. My demise. Dear Sid. By the time you read this, I will have joined the organization upstairs -- an exciting new beginning. I will retain fond memories of the many years you and I -- '
HUDSUCKER: Yeah, yeah, it's the standard resignation boilerplate -- go down to the second paragraph.
NORVILLE: 'Many years, uh... I know that you will be wondering why I have decided to move on, ending my tenure at Hudsucker, and here on Earth. You will be thinking, Why now, when things are going so well? Granted, from the standpoint of our balance sheet and financials, sure, sure, we're doing fine. However, Sid. These things have long since ceased to give me pleasure. I look at myself now and no longer see the idealistic young man who started this company. Now I see only an empty shell whom others call a 'success.' How has this come to pass? When and why did I trade all of my hopes, dreams and aspirations, for the emptiness of power and wealth? What the heck have I done?
