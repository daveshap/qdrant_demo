ELLIE: Hi.
JOSS: Hi.
ELLIE: I'm assuming you read my deposition.
JOSS: It was quite a page turner.
ELLIE: Pretty ironic, huh? I had to go all the way to the center of the galaxy... Just to find you.
ELLIE: So. I'm assuming they sent you here to administer last rites?
JOSS: I'm not sure it's come to that.
ELLIE: They don't believe me.
JOSS: I do.
ELLIE: You're sure you want to? In the universe I saw we're not exactly the stars of the show. What happened to me makes us all seem pretty damn small.
JOSS: It also makes God enormous. I think of the scope of your universe, Ellie... and it takes my breath away. As it will everyone else's.
ELLIE: I don't have any proof, Palmer.
JOSS: Ellie, you're the proof. You tell them your story. Ultimately they'll have no choice but to believe you.
ELLIE: It's not enough, don't you understand? I know it happened -- but by every standard of science, by every standard I've lived my life by that fact is utterly beside the point. It may be true but it doesn't matter because I can't prove it's real.
JOSS: Ellie, the only one holding you to that standard is you! The people want to hear your story, they need to hear it!
ELLIE: But --
JOSS: Have you seen what's happening out there? The terror, the despair? The world is on fire, Ellie. People need something they can believe in, something worthy, and you can give it to them!
ELLIE: I want to, Palmer -- more than anything. But it has to be real. It has to be true.
JOSS: Ellie... if you go out there like this -- if you admit to even the possibility that what you experienced didn't actually happen -- I'm afraid they really will crucify you. Please. For your own sake, for the sake of the world... tell them what you know to be the truth. Tell them it really happened.
