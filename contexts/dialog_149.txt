JORDY: It's your crime scene now. You can do what you want.
EDDIE: Watch the news?
JORDY: Nah, I musta missed it.
EDDIE: Well, just so you know. I gave you guys the credit.
JORDY: Well, just so you know, I don't care about that stuff.
EDDIE: Nah, why should you?
JORDY: I don't even watch TV.
EDDIE: Good. Good. Commendable.
JORDY: Did you get a report from the M.E.?
EDDIE: Sure. But I would like to ask you something. You got a problem with me?
JORDY: If you found me steppin' on your crime scene - it might piss you off, too. What about the report?
EDDIE: You were right, they were both dead before the fire. The male was stabbed so hard the killer broke off the tip of the knife in his spine. That's usually an indicator of something personal.
JORDY: The Super said he'd seen her before but she didn't live here.
EDDIE: Pretty.
JORDY: Hmmmm.
EDDIE: Maybe you don't care about that either. Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.
JORDY: Who says she's a suspect?
EDDIE: What would you call her?
JORDY: Look, I'm not even sure she has anything to do with this. I saw her outside after the fire - thought it was a lead. Maybe she saw something. Maybe she was visiting somebody here. Who knows?
