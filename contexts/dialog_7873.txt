GEORGIE: I thought this was gonna be a sex- change film!
ED: There's still a sex-change --
GEORGIE: Yeah! Five pages right before it ends! The rest of the show is about some schmuck who likes angora sweaters.
ED: I don't think he's a schmuck.
GEORGIE: And what's with this new title?! My poster says I CHANGED MY SEX"!"
ED: So change the poster. Trust me, you'll be better off. This is a story that's gonna <u>grab</u> people. It's about this guy. He's crazy about this girl but he likes to wear dresses. Should he tell her? Should he not tell her? He's torn. George, this is DRAMA.
