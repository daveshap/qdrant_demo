DAWN: Supposing we could get out of this room? Is there anything we could do to reach the bridge?
TAYLOR: It depends on the condition of the ship. If I could get to one of the suit compartments I could check the exterior air locks for a possible entry.
DAWN: Can't we access the mainframe to check the ship's condition?
TAYLOR: With what? How am I going to interface with it? I need to be able to talk to the system and to have the system talk to me.
