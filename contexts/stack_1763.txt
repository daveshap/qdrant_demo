How does a non-isolated SMPS work? My understanding is as follows:For an isolated SMPS, we first rectify the input ac voltage, then convert it to a square pulse using a switching regulator. It is then stepped down using a transformer, and then again rectified.For a non-isolated SMPS supply, I think we either first rectify it and then pass it through the switching regulator, or we first pass the input ac voltage through a switching regulator to get the desired voltage, and then rectify it to get a dc voltage.I would also appreciate if anyone can please share a block diagram of a non isolated SMPS.
