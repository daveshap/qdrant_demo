Honestly being cheated on stings
I’ve been married and divorced and am not a saint or anything but I am proud I never cheated. Every time I’ve felt things are not working out and I might end up looking for sex/attention elsewhere I break things up before I even meet someone. Maybe that’s why I am single at 35  but it’s better than cheating.

Just found out yesterday the woman I’ve been seeing “exclusive” for six months and whom I’ve been to trips and already had a lot of memories has always been with someone else all this time.

You never get too old to feel disheartened and disappointed and it is really hard to not blame yourself and get a hit on your self esteem.

I wonder why it is so hard just to say they want sex with someone else or just accept we are just a hook up. Self centrism and selfishness that’s what it is. 

I am hopeful I’ll find someone. It’s never too late.

> Edit: The kicker is that the other guy also thinks they are exclusive...

>Edit2: Catching up on Netflix Sex Education and realizing now I need to be checked also sucks...
