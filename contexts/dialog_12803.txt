WILLIAMS: You're not going to phone anybody where I am.
HILDY: Put down that gun, Earl.
HILDY: You're not going to shoot me, Earl. I'm your friend, remember? I've got to write that story about your Production for Use"."
WILLIAMS: Yes -- that's right. Production for use.
HILDY: Earl, you don't want to hurt your friends, do you?
WILLIAMS: Don't move!
WILLIAMS: Maybe you're my friend and maybe you're not -- but don't come any nearer. You can't trust anybody in this crazy world. Say, I'll bet I could shoot you from here.
HILDY: Sure you could, Earl -- but you wouldn't want to do that, would you? You wouldn't want to kill anybody.
WILLIAMS: No, no, you're right. I don't want to kill anybody. All I want to do is be let alone.
HILDY: Earl, there's just one thing I ought to clear up for the interview.
WILLIAMS: What's that? Only -- you're getting too near. I don't trust anybody.
HILDY: I don't blame you, Earl. If I were in your place I wouldn't trust anybody, either.
WILLIAMS: Keep away!
