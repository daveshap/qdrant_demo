KIMMY: You can't believe what it'd cost to bring in a temp.
JULIANNE: Uh. How about promoting a bridesmaid? Someone you know for at least forty-five minutes.
KIMMY: The bridesmaids are my only two female relatives under forty. Identical twin debutantes from Nashville, who are basically vengeful sluts. With amazing bodies!
JULIANNE: Which was the disqualifying factor?
KIMMY: The twin part. I like to remain impartial in my contempt.
