NANCY: Tell me about the kids.
NEIL: You'll get to meet them all tomorrow. They're...survivors. In a way. All severely sleep disordered. Insomnia, narcolepsy, bedwetting...
NANCY: But nightmares are the common thread?
NEIL: Right. They seem to share a group delusion, a boogeyman" for lack of a better word. They're so traumatized
NANCY: Anything?
NEIL: We lost a kid about a month ago to Fairview. I don't know where he got the razor...but he cut off his own eyelids to stay awake.
NANCY: Oh God.
NEIL: Ever work with vets? These kids act like they've got D.S.S. -- Delayed Stress Syndrome. If I didn't know better, I'd swear they'd seen heavy combat.
NANCY: I wouldn't be so sure they haven't.
NEIL: What's that supposed to mean?
NANCY: I've had some experience with pattern nightmares.
NEIL: So I've been told. Practically an obsession of your.
NANCY: Call it a passion. I've got to get going.
NEIL: Make sure to check in with Max, he'll give you the 25 cent tour.
