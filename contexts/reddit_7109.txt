Is it against hiring practices to seek young blonde sales representatives?
So at a meeting, one of the upper-echelon partners who talks to investors said maybe we should hire young, blonde people as sales reps. It made the minority and women sales rep feel uncomfortable and it pissed me off. It's a startup in CA, and I think that is against hiring practices. I don't know if I should say something to anyone or if I should make a big deal out of it? We don't have an official HR person YET, so don't know. 

What can I do to make my co-workers feel they are not in jeopardy? Is there anything I can do?
