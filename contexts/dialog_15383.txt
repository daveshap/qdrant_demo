PETER: We got a problem?
JEREMY: Our computer went on the fritz again. David came up to fix it.
PETER: Is it serious?
DAVID: Naw, it's all fixed. I also loaded up a program that'll analyze your games three hundred percent faster.
PETER: Thanks.
PETER: What's this?
DAVID: Oh, I put a few games on for your daughter. I hope you don't mind.
PETER: Of course not.
