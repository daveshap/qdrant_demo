Anyone else completely avoid tasks because they don't think they'll be good enough at it?
I have this a lot. I'll avoid cooking a new thing or doing a new task because I don't think I'll do a good enough job. I've noticed that a lot of my anxiety stems from a fear of disappointing other people, and I know that if I were to do a task for myself I could probably do it. But if the result affects others I completely tense up. It's like I suddenly forget to function at all if I'm given something I don't think I'll be good at. So I'll just avoid it entirely. Anyone else?
