LUKE: We ain't goin' nowhere.
DRAGLINE: What you talkin' about, Luke? We're together, you and me, just like always. Now the thing we gotta work out is how to get Koko outa there and then the Terrible Trio be all complete again. Man, this old Free World ain't gonna know which ear to stand on.
LUKE: Yeah, well, you and Koko kin handle it without me.
DRAGLINE: What you mean, Luke?
LUKE: I've done enough world-shakin' for a while. You do the rest for me. Send me a postcard about it.
DRAGLINE: But, Luke...
LUKE: Take it easy, Drag.
DRAGLINE: Luke. Where you goin?
LUKE: On my own.
DRAGLINE: But what am I gonna do all by myself? Oh if'n I hadn't lost mah head. I only had two more years to go. But when I saw you tearin' down with that truck... But you right Luke. We oughta split up. Be safer for us both.
