Did I ruine my life?
I am a 38 yr old man. Only done dead end jobs. Nothing worth mentioning think kid jobs fast food to retail and even garbage telemarketing, bill collector which i hated.

I finally got my G.E.D. at 31.  Now, i am trying to fix my life at a older age. 
My favorite school subjects was math/science. English is my kryptonite.

I am a bigger guy that needs to lose weight and slowly working on that which will make physical jobs hard for me. Not to mention i injured my back at a young age 21 working as a CNA.

I am not a fast paced person. I am slow to average in speed. I chicken peck typing around 20-30wpm. I have basic computer skills turn on and off and web surf or put in a application. If you have other questions please ask if needed.

I am looking for careers that will not age me out since i am older. I have a family, kids so can not be gone weeks and months at a time. I am looking for suggestions for a carrer that someone in my postion can get into. Lets hope it has future growth potential as well.

Your advice would be helpful or Is my life ruined by all of my life mistakes. Btw, my background/criminal record is clean.

Thank you for all your personal and thoughtful opinions or experience advice.
