How available is need-based financial aid for Master's of Public Health programs in the US?
I've been comparing tuition rates for MPH programs across the US, and they range from about $22k/year for in-state at a public school to more than $60k/year for out-of-state or private schools (among schools in the top 15 nationally). There are some 1-year programs (e.g. the MPH-45 at Harvard), but most are two years. I recently moved to California and would qualify for residency here before I apply next year. I've also thought about moving back home to Washington State before applying to the UW. 

At this point I can only compare the sticker price of these programs since I don't know how much financial aid I might receive. I'm just wondering if need-based aid is something I should remotely hope to be offered. I know some schools (e.g. UC Berkeley) do not provide any need-based aid, but others have it listed on their websites. I'm starting to reach out to the offices of financial aid at different schools to determine their procedures for calculating need-based aid, but I'm wondering if anyone who has gone through the application process can speak to whether any schools offered them substantive need-based aid. This may impact how I decide to allocate my financial assets (e.g. if there is a likelihood of receiving need-based aid, I may put more savings into my retirement accounts since they are nonreportable on the FAFSA). 

Thanks for the help!
