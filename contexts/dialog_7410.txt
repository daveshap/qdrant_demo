PRIEST: Okay, you better have something really sinful for me this time, son. My patience is worn to threads and your mom will be here any minute.
JAM: Alright, Father, here it is. About two weeks ago I went to my cousin's wedding and one of the bridesmaids asked me if I wanted to take a bath.
PRIEST: No...
JAM: I was insulted, so I asked her if I was wreaking some wicked b.o., right? Then she said no, she wanted to take a bath with me.
PRIEST: Oh, this is terrible... Please go on.
JAM: Well, she was a very tempting siren, Father. Built like you wouldn't believe. So I gave into temptation about a block away from the wedding reception at this little motel that charges by the hour.
PRIEST: Well? Continue! Continue!
JAM: Okay... when she peeled off that gown, you'll never guess what she was wearing underneath.
PRIEST: Was it a teddy?
JAM: No. Much bet... I mean, much more sinful than that.
PRIEST: A bustier?
JAM: Tell you what. You keep guessing and I'll say something when you get it.
PRIEST: Splendid! I love a good game of Name That Nightie.
