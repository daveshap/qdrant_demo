AUSTIN: Hello, Exposition.
BASIL EXPOSITION: Austin, Vanessa, let me bring you up to speed. Dr. Evil has high- jacked a nuclear warhead from Kreplachistan and is holding the world ransom for one-hundred billion dollars. If the world doesn't pay up in four days, he's threatening to destroy the world.
AUSTIN: Thank you, Exposition. Only two things, scare me, and one is nuclear war.
BASIL EXPOSITION: What's the other?
AUSTIN: Excuse me?
BASIL EXPOSITION: What's the other thing you're scared of?
AUSTIN: Carnies.
BASIL EXPOSITION: What?
AUSTIN: Circus folk. Nomads, you know. They smell like cabbage.
BASIL EXPOSITION: Indeed... If we could get back to the business at hand. It's one thing to have a warhead, it's quite another thing to have the missiles to launch it.
AUSTIN: Maybe these photographs are the last piece of that puzzle. I've uncovered the details on Project Vulcan. It's a new subterranean warhead delivery system.
BASIL EXPOSITION: Good God, and underground missile. We've long feared such a development.
