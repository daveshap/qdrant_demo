TORG: How can you tell that?
KRUGE: I trust my instincts. Admiral Kirk. This is your opponent speaking.
KRUGE: Do not lecture me about treaty violations. The Federation, in creating an ultimate weapon, has become a gang of Intergalactic criminals. It is not I who will surrender, it is you. On the planet below, I have three prisoners from the team who developed your doomsday weapon. If you do not surrender immediately, I will execute them, one at a time, as enemies of galactic peace.
KIRK: Who is this?! How dare you --
KRUGE: Who I am is not important. That I have them is. I will let you speak to them.
SAAVIK: Admiral, this is Lieutenant Saavik.
KIRK: Saavik... Is... David with you?
SAAVIK: Yes, he is. And someone else. Vulcan scientist of your acquaintance.
KIRK: This Vulcan -- is he alive?
SAAVIK: He is not himself -- but he lives. He is subject to rapid aging -- like this unstable planet.
DAVID: Hello, sir. It's David.
KIRK: David... Sorry I'm late.
DAVID: It's okay -- I should have known you'd come... Saavik's right: this planet is unstable. It's going to destroy itself in a matter of hours.
KIRK: David!... What went wrong?
DAVID: I went wrong.
KIRK: David, I don't understand...
DAVID: I'm sorry, sir. Just don't surrender. Genesis doesn't work! I can't believe they'll kill us for it --
KIRK: David?... David!
KRUGE: Admiral, your young friend is mistaken. I meant what I said. And now, to show my intentions are sincere... I am going to kill one of the prisoners.
KIRK: Wait! Give me a chance --
KRUGE:
