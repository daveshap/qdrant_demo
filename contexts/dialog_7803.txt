JESSICA: I'm so close I can feel it.
LLOYD: Me too. I'm almost there.
JESSICA: That's it. I'm done.
LLOYD: That was fast. Well, did you at least enjoy it?
JESSICA: No, it was a complete waste of time.
LLOYD: This is so embarrassing, it's never happened before. Well, maybe a couple of times, but I was alone.
JESSICA: That's my boyfriend.
LLOYD: Boyfriend? What about all that talk about riding my waxer?
JESSICA: Thanks, Lloyd. But I didn't find what I was looking for. Oh can you do me a favor and clean up? Collins can't know we were here.
