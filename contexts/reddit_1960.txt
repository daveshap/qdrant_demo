I just found out that I am the first person from my middle school to be accepted to an Ivy since 1931
It's a small town, really poor. We send our students to another high school (~30 minutes away), and almost all do very poorly there, academically and socially (lots of drug use). I've grown up in trailer parks my whole life, although I'm very grateful to my caring parents. I've always felt like I wanted to represent my town. I'm very proud of where I came from, and I just wanted to share. It's surreal. 

Also, I can't compete with 1931 dude. Stupid Harvard
