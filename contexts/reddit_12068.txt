My best friends forgot to include me in planning our tattoo.
My roommates/best friends and I decided we wanted to get similar tattoos to represent the city we're studying abroad in. They both have multiple tattoos all over, I have none, so I was a bit hesitant at first and said I probably wouldn't, even though they managed to strike a deal with the artist for a cheaper price if we all went together. I reconsidered and said yes a week ago, I wanted to, and they were both ecstatic. One of them tells me casually on our way to class that they decided to make the appointment tonight to get it done in another week or so. I was a little taken aback as I expected more time to decide on a design and everything, as I wanted something a little more ornate than them. I asked why, and she said that because of the various trips they were both planning (some of which we're going together on) and other tattoos, they should just go ahead and schedule it. I expressed that I was upset that they went ahead and planned it without mentioning it to me or taking my preferences into consideration, since this was something we were supposed to do together. She responds that "I guess we just forgot you weren't involved in that conversation".

I've already felt a little left out of our trio, since my schedule is pretty different from theirs and they go to the gym together, so then for them to say they FORGOT to include me in plans to get a tattoo together really hurts.
