Hi, I'm 16 and I need help, I don't wanna relapse.
Hi, I'm Blake. I've had depression since I was 8 and I started Zoloft and Lamictal at 14. I've had a lot happen to me, I think all of us have. I've been doing better. I quit porn (or I haven't orgasmed to it), I've tried being nicer, and I'm working on being a better person. The issue is...I've been an asshole to my parents as of late..I made my mom cry with how I don't respect her. I've done so many fucked up things in the past, stuff I can't even speak of. I try to forgive myself, but I can't. I just wallow in self pity when I get sad and play the victim. I have been the victim, yet I use it as an excuse at times. I need help forgiving myself for the things I've done, they haunt me every day. I say I'll change, and I do for a while...but then I relapse. I can't accept that I need to feel shitty for the things I've done. I would like some advice, real advice, on how to forgive yourself even after continuously messing up after you say you'll be better. I need help. Thank you.

Edit: thank you for all the support, it means a lot. I'm sorry I didn't flesh out my post, but it's just hard to dwelve into. If you wanna hear stuff, just message me, I don't wanna plague you all on here with my issues. Seriously, thank you though.
