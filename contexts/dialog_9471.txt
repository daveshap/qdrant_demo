JACK: He was the guerrilla terrorist of the food service industry.
TYLER: Don't watch. I can't if you watch.
TYLER: ... Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
JACK: He farted on meringue; he sneezed on braised endive; and, with creme of mushroom soup, well...
TYLER: Go ahead. Say it.
JACK: You get the idea.
JACK: I don't know about this.
TYLER: I don't know, either. I want to find out. I've never been hit, have you?
JACK: No. That's a good thing, isn't it?
TYLER: I don't want to die without any scars. How much can you really know about yourself if you've never been in a fight? Come on... you're the only person I've ever asked.
JACK: Me?
TYLER: Why not you? I'm letting you go first. Do it.
JACK: This is crazy.
TYLER: Alright, go crazy. Let 'er rip.
JACK: Where do you want it? In the face?
TYLER: Surprise me.
JACK: Shit. Sorry. That didn't count.
TYLER: Like hell. That counted.
TYLER: How do you feel?
JACK: Strange.
TYLER: But a good strange.
JACK: Is it?
TYLER: We've crossed the threshold. You want to call it off?
JACK: Call what off?
TYLER: The fight.
JACK: What fight?
TYLER: This fight, pussy.
TYLER: If you could fight anyone... one on one, whoever you wanted, who would you fight?
JACK: Anyone?
TYLER: Anyone.
JACK: My boss, probably. Who would you fight?
TYLER: My dad. No question.
JACK: Oh, yeah. I didn't know my dad. Well, I knew him, till I was six. He went and married another woman, had more kids. Every six years or so he'd do it again -- new city, new family.
TYLER: He was setting up franchises. My father never went to college, so it was really important that I go.
JACK: I know that.
TYLER: After I graduated, I called him long distance and asked, Now what?" He said
JACK: Same here.
TYLER: A generation of men raised by women. I'm wondering if another woman is the answer we really need.
