Anyone else feel like commiting suicide out of spite?
Because I do. Every single time my family tells me to "snap out of my depression" and "go back to being the person you used to be" I feel like killing myself in front of them. They don't understand the severity of my situation. They think I can just "change". As if I wanted this to be my life. I absolutely hate myself and think of how every second I'm alive is wasted. My mind is a mess and the last time I was genuinely happy was ages ago. I don't know what to do anymore.
