MS. B. HAVEN: Freezy, I'm feeling...hot.
FREEZE: I find that unlikely.
MS. B. HAVEN: Okay, my hair is brittle, my skin is dry and I don't care. I'd weather blizzards to have you. You're the most perfect man I've ever known.
FREEZE: To be frozen. To never change. A life of perpetual ice-olation. There is little perfection in that.
MS. B. HAVEN: What say we turn up the heat?
FREEZE: You're skating on thin ice. My passion thaws for my bride alone.
MS. B. HAVEN: Forget your frosty femme. These lips are wet and ready to get frostbite.
FREEZE: Hop away little bunny. Before I cool your jets. Permanently.
