LIZ: If you don't tie up all the loose ends it'll never be over.
FISHER: No...
LIZ: You put him down or don't bother coming back.
FISHER: But...
LIZ: Do you love me? DO YOU LOVE ME?!
MOORE: You alright?
FISHER: Yeah. I'm thinking about Micheal's Franco Harris fixation. You know how Micheal was always harping Immaculate Reception?" I've seen that play. A lot of times...and I have to say this... Franco was lucky. Flat out
