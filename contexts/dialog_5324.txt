NICKY: Do you see that? Dumb Jew motherfucker. Grew up together and he's actin' like he don't even know me. I know we're supposed to avoid each other, but, you know, there's ways to do things and there's ways not to.
DOMINICK: Yeah. Fuck him.
SHERBERT: To Abraham Lincoln.
ACE: L'chaim. [Yiddish for 'to life']
SHERBERT: Here we go. Good luck.
DOMINICK: Forget about it, Nick. Don't let it bother you.
NICKY: Why, does it look like it's bothering me? What do I give a fuck? Fuckin' Oscar too. All the fuckin' money I've given that prick, he don't even look over here. What's his problem?
MARINO: Mm.
NICKY: Fuckin' Jews stick together, don't they?
MARINO: They're havin' a good time too.
NICKY: So are we.
