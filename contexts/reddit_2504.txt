I feel like I’m failing at my first job out of school. How do I know if it’s imposter syndrome or I’m just legitimately bad at my job?
I graduated about a year ago and have been in my current full time job at a marketing agency for about 7 months. I had multiple internships before this job, but this is my first full-time role.

I pretty consistently feel anxious about how my coworkers are perceiving my performance. I often feel like I’m slow to catch on with specific tasks (ex. Navigating the platform used to set up digital display ads) and have to ask multiple questions. Whenever I ask my manager or coworkers a question, I feel like I’m annoying and bothering them.

I struggle with anxiety in general, but I also feel like I have a good sense of self-awareness and genuinely feel like I’m not doing my best. That being said, I had a 3 month review and it went well. I haven’t really brought up my concerns except to sometimes over apologize or thank my coworkers for their patience with me.

How do I get over this anxiety or increase my performance? I feel like I’m trying so hard, but to still be making stupid mistakes makes me feel awful.
