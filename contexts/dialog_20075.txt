PAULA: I don't know what it is. It could be anything.
JOE: But you knew right off what I was talking about, didn't you, Paula! Did you let that boy --
PAULA: Don't you dare ask me that question. I'm an adult and you got no right to push your nose into my affairs like that!
JOE: Well, as long as you live in this house, young lady, you live by my rules! You should be dating local boys.
PAULA: Uh-uh! Not a chance! There's nobody in this town doing anything with his life, except what his father did, which is nothing. If I can't have more out of life than that, I'd rather be dead!
JOE: Do you honestly think you'll find a boy in that... that officer's school who's serious about marriage?
PAULA: Yes I do!
JOE: Then you're dumber than I thought! All you'll get from their kind is pregnant!
