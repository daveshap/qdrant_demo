Which fundamental force underlies inertia? We learn about the four fundamental forces (gravity, electromagnetism, strong, weak). I am curious about how these four forces mediate/cause/drive everyday phenomena. In particular, it has never been clear how inertia arises as a result or is caused by these forces.So taking a car accelerating while driving up a hill. The fundamental forces will act in numerous ways to require energy expenditure: (1) The car moves uphill against earth's gravitational field (2) Electrostatic interactions cause friction with road surface(3) Air are jostled/displaced (electromagnetic repulsion between molecules of car and air)But the increasing inertia of the car is mysterious. If the four forces underlie all action/reaction, which one of them is responsible for requiring the energy to accelerate the car and increase its KE? Among household names, it seems that Einstein (and perhaps Feynman) supposed that inertia was related to gravity in a \"Mach\"-ian manner. My reading comes up blank when I try to find a consensus view. It seems inertia is taken for granted as a fundamental aspect of reality but is not explained/explainable in terms of the four fundamental forces. Thoughts?
