Question About Unemployment
I worked in New Jersey part-time (12 hr/week) from May 2018 until November 2019. I began working in NY as a temp to full employee (35 hr/week but usually 40/hr week). 


I worked from  November 11, 2019, and got laid off on March 25, 2020. NY is telling me that I have not worked long enough (quarters?) to qualify for unemployment. 


Is there anything I can do? Any help would be appreciated. I live in New Jersey by the way.
