DRIVER: Two miles! Minefields over there. Do you know where this campground is or not?
BILLY: Not far. Just a little way.
DRIVER: No! I'm not going any further! It'll wreck my car.
BILLY: I'll pay extra
DRIVER: How much?
BILLY: Where are the minefields?
DRIVER: All over. Turkish Army up there. It's against the law. They shoot us. You sure you looking for your friends, man?
BILLY: Okay! Ley me out right here. I'm getting tired of all this bullshit from you. I'll walk it.
DRIVER: Ah, look! they probably know where the campers are
