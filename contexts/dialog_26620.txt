DOLORES: I have a question for you, Mr. Stephens.
MITCHELL: What's that, Dolores?
DOLORES: I told you that I was doing fifty miles an hour when the accident happened. That's how I remembered it. But the truth is, I might have been doing sixty. Or sixty five. And if that's true, that I was over the limit when the bus went over, what would happen then?
MITCHELL: That would complicate things.
DOLORES: Because I'd be to blame, right?
MITCHELL: Billy Ansel will insist that you were driving fifty-one miles an hour. Just like you've done every morning for the past fifteen years.
DOLORES: He knows that? Billy?
MITCHELL: Yes. He does.
DOLORES: Billy said that?
DOLORES: You've talked to Billy?
MITCHELL: I did.
DOLORES: And Billy told you that he'll tell that to...
MITCHELL: Mrs. Driscoll, if Billy Ansel does not volunteer to say so in court, I will subpoena him and oblige him to testify to that effect.
