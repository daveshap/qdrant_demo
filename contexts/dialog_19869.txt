WILLIAM: Excuse me.
THIEF: Yes.
WILLIAM: Bad news.
THIEF: What?
WILLIAM: We've got a security camera in this bit of the shop.
THIEF: So?
WILLIAM: So, I saw you put that book down your trousers.
THIEF: What book?
WILLIAM: The one down your trousers.
THIEF: I haven't got a book down my trousers.
WILLIAM: Right -- well, then we have something of an impasse. I tell you what -- I'll call the police -- and,	what can I say? -- If I'm wrong about the whole book-down-the-trousers scenario, I really apologize.
THIEF: Okay -- what if I did have a book down my trousers?
WILLIAM: Well, ideally, when I went back to the desk, you'd remove the Cadogan guide to Bali from your trousers, and either wipe it and put it back, or buy it. See you in a sec.
WILLIAM: Sorry about that...
ANNA: No, that's fine. I was going to steal one myself but now I've changed my mind. Signed by the author, I see.
WILLIAM: Yes, we couldn't stop him. If you can find an unsigned copy, it's worth an absolute fortune.
THIEF: Excuse me.
ANNA: Yes.
THIEF: Can I have your autograph?
ANNA: What's your name?
THIEF: Rufus.
THIEF: What does it say?
ANNA: Well, that's the signature -- and above, it says 'Dear Rufus -- you belong in jail.'
THIEF: Nice one. Would you like my phone number?
ANNA: Tempting but... no, thank you.
