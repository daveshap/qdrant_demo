Long story but 15 and need advice?
Pretty much theres one guy who at least to me seems amazing. He is really funny, nice, has the same music taste as me, makes amazing music, plays instruments (including saxophone like ahh i love sax so much its so preeetty), apparently has a really great family, has some of the same friends as me, is v cute oops, gave me butterflies for the first time (i thought that was a made up thing wtf), and more. So after posting on my spam account that I didnt want to like him anymore because im too awkward, one of mine and his friends said that i should do something because he wont be in my school next year. SO  I did probably the most brave thing ive ever done (im not brave if you couldnt tell ahha) and went up to him in person in front of all of his friends and spoke to him i was so nervous lmao; the full palms sweaty moms spaghetti. I then spoke to him after and he was so nice to me and ah. Its just that we havent spoken since and its too awkward to talk in person (he literally said to me "sorry if it was awkward" so, well...). So if you couldnt tell by now im 1.a naturally nervous person 2.someone whos never been in a relationship or anything like that. I dont know what to do now. We dont sit next to each other in class, and ive been told i give off a very shy vibe but then when you get to know me im surprisingly talkative (just dunno how to get to the point where he knows that because he makes me 10x more nervous than I already would be). Its weird because I always think to myself that nothing could ever happen between us but then there will be times where ill see him looking at me and that one time he spoke to me he was giving me loads of compliments (things that friends do too so i should stfu ahah) but like honestly id be just as happy just being his friend he seems like a great friend. Do you have any advice on how to actually talk to him properly in person and not just every once in a while over dms?
