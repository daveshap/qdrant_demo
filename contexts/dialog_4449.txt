ROCCO: Oh man. You gotta let me do these guys. I'm such a moron. I gotta make up for the tit thing.
CONNOR: No way. I've been waitin' for this asshole.
ROCCO: Aw, c'mon. I gotta clear my family name here. I've brought shame to the house of Della Rocco.
MURPHY: Give the guy a shot.
CONNOR: Rocco, this is the real deal. We must kill without hesitation, without guilt or remorse. Evil man, dead man.
