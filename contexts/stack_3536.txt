Proper way to verify keycard integrity I have thought about building an electronic door locking system. Would the following mechanism be secure at all to prevent tampering plain text information on card?hash private system key together with cardholder datasave the hash and card holder data to an RFID cardthe lock (which only has the private key) takes the cardholder data and hash when authenticatingthe lock creates a hash using it's private key (the same used in creating the card) and plain text data from card.Lock compares the hash it generated to hash on the cardAny particular vulnerabilities other than brute forcing?
