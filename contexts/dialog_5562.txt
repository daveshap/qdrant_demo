JUDE: We had a court-martial in your absence. They wanted to put a bullet in your head. I pleaded for clemency. Said we should find out what happened first. So what did happen?
FERGUS: He ran. I couldn't shoot him in the back. I tried to catch him. He made it to the road and got hit by a Saracen.
JUDE: So you did fuck up.
FERGUS: Yes.
JUDE: But you know what the thing is, Fergus?
FERGUS: No, what is the thing?
JUDE: You vanished quite effectively. Became Mister Nobody. And you've no idea how useful that could be.
FERGUS: What do you mean?
JUDE: We've got some plans here. And we'll need a Mister Nobody to execute them.
FERGUS: No way, Jude. I'm out.
JUDE: You're never out, Fergus.
