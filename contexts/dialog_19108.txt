TRIPLETTE: I'm sorry. I feel as if I know you. I'm John Triplette... a friend of Del Reese... I was at the airport. I just wanted to introduce myself. I'm a great fan of hers. If there's anything you need, just give me a call. I'm at the Sheraton South.
BARNETT: She's going to rest now.
TRIPLETTE: Okay, I just wanted to see if I could help out at all.
BARNETT: I appreciate your concern, but she has to rest, so you can go on home.
TRIPLETTE: Oh, sure.
BARNETT: What do you really want?
TRIPLETTE: Not a thing, Barnett, really. I need a little information. But, ah, it can wait.
BARNETT: You bet.
TRIPLETTE: Okay. Thanks.
