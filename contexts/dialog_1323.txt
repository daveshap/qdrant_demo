HELEN: How-do-you-do, Mrs. Dickson.
MRS. DICKSON: Is that busy husband of mine busy?
HELEN: He's at a board meeting.
MRS. DICKSON: Board meeting. Oh, that means hours, I suppose.
HELEN: I'm afraid so.
MRS. DICKSON: Helen, did you ever try competing with a bank?
HELEN: No.
MRS. DICKSON: Well, take my word for it, and don't try it. It's useless! If it were some other woman, I could handle her, but after all, you can't scratch a bank's eyes out now, can you?
HELEN: Hardly.
MRS. DICKSON: Oh, well. I guess the only other thing for me to do is to go out and buy myself a few sticks of dynamite. When he comes out, you tell him I'll be back. He hasn't gotten rid of me!
HELEN: All right.
CLUETT: Dude - there's not any chance of my becoming involved in this, is there?
DUDE: You? No, you'll be all right, so long as you establish an alibi for tonight.
CLUETT: know, butâ€”
DUDE: Be sure you're with somebody responsible in case any questions are asked. Understand?
CLUETT: But Dude, listen - couldn't we make this some other time?
DUDE: Listen, buddy, you're getting by pretty easy. Quit squawking!
