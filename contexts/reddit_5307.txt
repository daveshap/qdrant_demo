Should my boss get mad at me for asking for days off?
I'm a high school students who is very active in school. I originally got the job to pay for my exchange student program, but now my mom wants to go on vacation and I won a scholarship to go to a NASA space camp in Alabama, USA for free. 

I'm never late without calling in first (the only times I've been late were due to car accidents, school meetings that I crunched time for, and emergencies) and I've never been late more than 15 minutes. I usually work 6 days a week and work around 20-30 hours a week (about 2 hours after school and full days when we don't have school). They've never yelled at me specifically, but they have been stern with me before, especially with my waitressing (I'm a dishwasher 50% of the time). 

I already asked off for my exchange student program, which is about 2 weeks long, and I'm terrified to ask for the other two weeks off. I'm afraid that they will fire me. Do you think they would? Asking for about half my summer off is a bit of a big deal...
