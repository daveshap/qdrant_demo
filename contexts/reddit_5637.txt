How big of an employment gap is acceptable?
I left my job in January 2020 due to health issues of my family. Both my mom & dad fell sick at the same time which was feared to be Covid-19 but thankfully it wasn't. I've been looking for an opportunity ever since and it's nearly the end of May. I've had interviews in between but most companies either took down the position or froze hiring because of which I now have a substantial gap between January-May till I get a job. 

Can anyone tell me if companies would consider this gap due to the current pandemic or is my chance of restarting a career in high risk? 

Looking for opinions.
