I don't want people to remember me.
I only want my close friends and family members to remember me... Not people I haven't talked to in a year or so... It's offensive to me. You could have talked to me and you could have cared, but untill I take my own life, you suddenly care and miss me... I don't mean to offend anyone on this post...
