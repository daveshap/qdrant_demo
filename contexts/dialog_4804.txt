MARY: It's my first cigarette in over a year.
FRANK: The first is always the best.
MARY: It's the waiting that's killing me, not knowing, you know? It's really hard on my mother. The doctor doesn't think my father'll make it. He says he was dead too long, after six minutes the brain starts to die and once that goes, close the door.
FRANK: You never know.
MARY: I mean if he was dead, I could handle that.
FRANK: At least he's got people around him.
MARY: I'm not so sure. My father and I haven't spoken in three years. When my brother called to say my father was having a heart attack, that he'd locked himself in the bathroom, all the way going over I was thinking how I was gonna tell him what a bastard he was. Then when I got up the stairs and we moved him onto the bed, I thought of all these other things I wanted to say.
FRANK: Even when you say the things, there's always more things.
MARY: Right now, I'm more worried about my mother than anything. They won't let her see my father.
FRANK: Go home. Take her home. Get some rest. Not going to find anything out now.
MARY: That's what I told her. If she could just see him a second, then I could take her home.
