Short Story or Novella About Observing the Future Trying to identify a story:I read it in an anthology during the 80's.  The anthology may have been older than that.Narrator is sent by an organization to view the future.  He does this on multiple occasions, with the future becoming stranger each time.  I'm not sure of the method used to grant him this view.His perspective of observation is quasi-orbital.  He views Earth from a great height and can zoom in for greater detail.He is mainly engaged in observing continental Europe.  During one of his observations, he determines that the majority of the European public now belongs to single-sex organizations that are at war with each other (Male vs. Female).I'm sorry there's not more to go on.
