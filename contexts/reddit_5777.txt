How bleak are my carer prospects?
I graduated from a public university 21 months ago with my Bachelor's in Environmental Science and my Master's in Climate Science (4+1 program). Since then, I've filled out about 100 applications and I've gotten a few phone interviews and one in person interview and nothing. Since graduation I've had internships with the local city government doing work in my field for 13 of those 21 months. It's valuable experience but only at internship level. Due to the fact that my wife is in a Master's program, I haven't been able to apply out of the area. I live in Southern California. How bad do I look to companies now that I've been effectively unemployed for almost two years? What strategies do you recommend to get a job? I've gone to networking events, volunteered etc.
