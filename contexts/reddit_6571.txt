Is working at UPS or Amazon a decent career?
So to give a little bit of background, I’m a full time mechanic, I have no benefits, no pension, no 401k and the pay for mechanics in my state is low (might cap around 26$ hour). I’m 23 years old and I make 18$ an hour. My question is, is working for a company like UPS or Amazon a good career change choice. I have bills of my own that I can not really afford to lower my income. I’m not really a desk type of person so call centers aren’t really my thing. Does anyone have experience working for these companies and what can I expect to make working there? I know it’s probably not the smartest to switch careers but I’m torn. This industry is very hard for you to make money. I would probably make 30k to 60k in this field working 70 - 80 hours a week.
