TALLEY: Did you find Jane and Mandy?
LOUISE'S VOICE: Could you call me back on your phone? Right away.
TALLEY: What's wrong with the radio?
LOUISE'S VOICE: Other people can hear us. Just call. <u>Please</u>.
TALLEY: Stand by.
TALLEY: Is something wrong with Jane?
LOUISE: We have a boy on the line. He says he's Thomas Smith and he's calling from the house.
TALLEY: It's a crank, Louise. C'mon, don't waste my time with that!
LOUISE: His cell number belongs to the Smiths. I think it's real, Chief. I think this boy is inside that house.
