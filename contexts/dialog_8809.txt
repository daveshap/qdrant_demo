GUENEVERE: I loved you much, as King, and sometimes as husband, but one cannot gaze too long at the sun in the sky.
ARTHUR: Forgive me, my wife, if you can. I was not born to live a man's life, but to be the stuff of future memory. The fellowship was a brief beginning, a fair time that cannot be forgotten; and because it will not be forgotten, that fair time may come again. Now once more I must ride with my knights to defend what was, and the dream of what could be.
GUENEVERE: I have kept it.
