Deactivated fb, it was damaging me mentally. No one has even noticed!
Last Saturday morning, I deactivated fb (with a view to letting it delete after however long it takes). I found that despite 400+ 'friends', I actually wasn't enjoying it at all anymore. I know it's a clich√©, and not real at all, but seeing people live their seemingly perfect lives, going out together, watching the little cliques develop and feeling increasingly left out, I decided enough was enough. It's not helping my mental health in the slightest. It has to go.

It is, admittedly, somewhat cathartic and liberating to no longer be a part of that social media network. I still have the ability to use messenger, so can still talk to people. But I think what's hurt a little more is literally only one person has noticed I'm no longer active on there. Which I suppose really hits home how insignificant my online presence was.

I feel very lonely. Friends that used to message me daily no longer message at all, and if I message them, it just gets left on 'read'. There are only so many times I can try, before I stop because clearly they won't respond.

There were so many of those friends that consistently would post / share memes etc about depression, anxiety; suicide. About how much they care and how we should all reach out if we haven't heard from someone in a while. The irony is, no one has. And despite not wanting to believe it, I don't think anyone will.

I work, I go home, walk / feed / play with my dog, then go to bed. I'm usually in bed by 8.30pm (up at 6am) because there seems little to stay awake for anymore.

I've posted on here once or twice, yo other subreddits, but never to this depth of revealing my feelings. I honestly don't mind if no one resounds, it's just useful for me to get this out of me.

I hate feeling sorry for myself, and I hate burdening people, even strangers - so anyone that reads this! with my ridiculous insignificant problems.

I'm just so very lonely. I'm sorry.
