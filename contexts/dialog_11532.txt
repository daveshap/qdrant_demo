TOM: California, here we come!
AL: Ain't you gonna look back, Ma?--give the ol' place a last look?
MA: We're goin' to California, ain't we? Awright then, let's *go* to California.
AL: That don't sound like you, Ma. You never was like that before.
MA: I never had my house pushed over before. I never had my fambly stuck out on the road. I never had to lose... ever'thing I had in life.
GRAMPA: *Ain't* a-goin'... ain't a-goin'...
