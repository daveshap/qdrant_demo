APICS certification
Anyone have APICS certification, and is it worth it? Which cert do you have?
I had begun looking for jobs back in Dec, and then stalled out while I decided if I wanted to pursue a certification. Then COVID came along. Now I'm back to looking for a new job, whether the time is right or not. I have a fair amount of supply chain experience, but it's specifically in the Agriculture industry. I've worked Ag for about 11 years now, but likely going to end up in another, less specific industry. Just trying to figure out again if I should get a cert and if it would help. I see plenty of jobs posted that say APICS is desired and I always mention in my cover letter that I would get it if needed.... thanks.
Reposting with different flair. Didn't get responses on first post.
