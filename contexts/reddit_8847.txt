Is illegal immigration a problem in the US, and if so, what should be done?
Thanks to /u/Marlinsoverdolphins for proposing this topic.

A majority of Americans [believe illegal immigration is a problem](https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/zqz3kg39gt/tabs_OPI_Illegal_Immigration_20150902.pdf) (PDF) and voters [broadly support measures to curb it.](http://www.fairus.org/facts/illegal-immigration-and-amnesty-polls)

However, the Obama administration [deported more illegal immigrants than any in history,](http://www.snopes.com/obama-deported-more-people/) while the total number of illegal immigrants in the country [peaked in 2007 and has been slowly declining since then.](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/03/5-facts-about-illegal-immigration-in-the-u-s/) 

So, is illegal immigration really a problem in the US? If so, what are the best solutions?

[This article](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/431012/fixing-illegal-immigration-five-steps) argues for a strictly enforced kind of "one strike" policy, whereby anyone found to have entered the country illegally is thereafter ineligible for any legal status. Along those lines, the non-profit Federation for American Immigration Reform, an "organization of concerned individuals who believe that our immigration laws must be reformed to better serve the needs of current and future generations," issued their [Priorities for the 2017 Presidential Transition,](http://www.fairus.org/news/fair-issues-blueprint-for-true-immigration-reform-in-the-new-administration) which outlines even more extensive measures to address the issue.

On the other hand, [Ron Paul says](https://mises.org/blog/how-solve-illegal-immigration-problem) we simply have to:

> Eliminate incentives for those who would come here to live off the rest of us, and make it easier and more rational for those who wish to come here legally to contribute to our economy. No walls, no government databases, no biometric national ID cards. But not a penny in welfare for immigrants.

Is there evidence suggesting what effect any of these proposals would have on illegal immigration? Have other countries curbed their immigration problems with specific measures like these? Has the US done so in the past?
