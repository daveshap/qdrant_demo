LURCH: The guy was looking for trouble, shoving people around, being an asshole...
DOYLE: And he took a swing at you?
LURCH: Yeah...the guy was psycho - I was just tying to protect the girl...
DOYLE: Did he harm the girl?
LURCH: Hell, he probably raped her in the lot, dumped the body somewhere. That's what he was like - a real wacko.
DOYLE: Mm-hmm...that's not what the bartender told us.
DOYLE: Now you listen to me hay-seed! If you don't want to spend a year in jail for making a false report you'll start giving me straight answers, you got that!!
LURCH: Alright, alright! We were just fucking with him..you know?
