OLD MAN: It's not been long enough. What witchcraft is this?
KILVARA: Impressive -- is it not? The problem is I can only keep the illusion for a few minutes. I need more power to hold the form longer. I need the Highlander. Where is he?
OLD MAN: I do not know -- and even if I did...
KILVARA: I know. I know-- you would not tell me. Loyalty -- it really is a concept that eludes me. Oh well -- I shall find him. Time is on my side.
