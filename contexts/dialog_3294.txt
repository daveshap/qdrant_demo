DELIA: Lydia, I will never forgive you for embarrassing me in front of my social inferiors. You help us with these ghosts or you'll be sorry.
LYDIA: I'm sorry already.
CHARLES: Now, let's get back to business. I want to get Maxie Dean and Sarah up here immediately. I can make history here! I'm going to turn this sleepy little backward town into a leading supernatural research center... and amusement park.
LYDIA: I cannot believe this.
CHARLES: Delia will cook...
CHARLES: I'll bring the wine... and the business plan. And Lydia you'll bring the ghosts.
LYDIA: I can't <u>bring</u> the ghosts. They're not here!
CHARLES: Otho, could you actually... do something with them?
OTHO: Perhaps if I were properly motivated.
LYDIA: That's slavery and murder. You don't know these people. They're just like you and me. They're nice people!
