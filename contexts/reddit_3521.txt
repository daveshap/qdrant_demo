Do very attractive people get treated differently? Almost frowned upon? Serious question o
A friend of mine who is perfect looking, with amazing facial features were talking about it today about dating and she mentioned she gets judged very easily because of her looks. For example, she is interested in someone who most would say isn't each others type. She said the people she dates have had the other persons friends reach out to her and ask what her motive was,
Gold digging, cat fishing etc ( basically saying what are you doing with that person). And I'm genuinely curious to if anyone else experiences this. We also talked about how most girls frown upon her for no reason, can people just simply dislike a person because they are to good looking?
