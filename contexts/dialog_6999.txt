FRIDA: I think I just got my period.
JENNIFER: Does that mean this whole thing is over?
FRIDA: Probably for three weeks or so anyway. I'm not sure -- I don't get how it works.
JENNIFER: Let's do some research. I'll check the libraries. You surf the web.
FRIDA: You're such a good friend.
JENNIFER: So are you. Look, go about your life. Act like nothing's wrong. We'll get to the bottom of this.
FRIDA: Mr. Grant. Did you read that script I was talking about?
MR. GRANT: Uh... yes. Not for us. No woman in jeopardy. Find me Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman. Find me a true story about a crazed killer stalking beautiful women.
FRIDA: No.
MR. GRANT: No?
FRIDA: No. I quit. Take your lame ass ideas, your fake ass toupee, your fat ass wife and your ugly ass kids and shove them.
MR. GRANT: Very well then. Is that all?
PETER: Frida. I was looking for you. You changing jobs?
FRIDA: Yeah sort of. Where's Lloyd?
PETER: I need to talk to you. About us. Frida... I... Can I carry your box?
FRIDA: No, I got it. It's okay.
PETER: What happened?
FRIDA: What happened?
PETER: I thought we were starting something... and then... I know it's unorthodox, I mean with you being involved in the case and all.
FRIDA: I just don't know if I should be dating anyone right now.
PETER: Yeah, every guy you date winds up dead.
PETER: Except Mark of course.
FRIDA: What's that supposed to mean?
PETER: Did I tell you I have the worst sense of humor and I make bad jokes at totally inappropriate times?
FRIDA: No, but thanks for the warning.
PETER: Speaking of Mark -- we've tried to track him down and there's no sight of him. Vanished into thin air. I got a hunch he fled the country.
FRIDA: Interesting possibility.
