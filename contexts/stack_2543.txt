Embedding ArcMap map (*.mxd) in blog? I am learning ArcGIS so there is a lot I still need to learn. I created a map in ArcMap and want to insert this map on my blog. Basically, I want to embed it. But all I can find is how to embed a map I make on ArcGIS On Line. How do I take this map (mxd extension) and put it on my blog? I did upload it in to my content on line if that is needed.
