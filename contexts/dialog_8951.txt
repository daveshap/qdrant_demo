FRANK: I didn't hear you come in.
JACK: What're you doing?
FRANK: Oh ... I was just hoping for something to drink. But it seems the old lady was dry. Not even a bottle of cooking sherry.
FRANK: Uh, we already boxed some things. I figured you'd want to go through Dad's stuff. It's in there. If you want to get started.
JACK: Later.
JACK: Is everything done? The arrangements, I mean.
FRANK: Oh. Yeah. It was all worked out before, you know. She and Dad had taken care of it.
JACK: Right.
FRANK: I set it for Wednesday. The ceremony. They're doing the stone today. It's okay? Wednesday?
JACK: Yeah, fine.
FRANK: There's not going to be a viewing. I figured with the kids and all ...
JACK: Sure.
