MAN IN BLACK: How old were you?
INIGO: I was eleven years old. When I was strong enough, I dedicated my life to the study of fencing. So the next time we meet, I will not fail. I will go up to the sixfingered man and say, Hello
MAN IN BLACK: You've done nothing but study swordplay?
INIGO: More pursuit than study lately. You see, I cannot find him. It's been twenty years now. I am starting to lose confidence. I just work for Vizzini to pay the bills. There's not a lot of money in revenge.
MAN IN BLACK: Well, I certainly hope you find him, someday.
INIGO: You are ready, then?
MAN IN BLACK: Whether I am or not, you've been more than fair. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 30.
INIGO: You seem a decent fellow. I hate to kill you.
MAN IN BLACK: You seem a decent fellow. I hate to die.
INIGO: Begin!
