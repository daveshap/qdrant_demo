A tinder story
A few years ago, my girlfriend dumped me for another guy. I felt heartbroken. I’m not a very emotional person but I was crying for a whole day. I didn’t know what to do. I eventually re downloaded tinder. I got a few compliments and dates but nothing special and I felt like giving up. But then I saw this one girl. There was something different about her. 

She was everything I ever wanted. Smart, cute, athletic, motivated, helpful. She wasn’t like the ten gals that want to be stay at home moms and eat Cheetos all day long (no offense to any sahm) that I just swiped left on. I swiped right on her and I kept checking my phone for a notification. A few hours later she matched with me and we messaged back and forth for hours. She agreed to go out on a date. 

I was hit with nerves about everything. I freaking wore a red flannel shirt, ripped dark blue jeans, and black leather boots. I got a bottle of wine and spilt it everywhere. I thought it was done but she felt different. She viewed me as genuine. 

After a few more dates (that we’re also much better), we began dating. We got higher paying jobs and eventually moved in together. She has been my world for the past three years. Even if it’s just reading and drinking coffee on a rainy day, the view of her makes me feel the sun start shining. Tomorrow she planned a date at the original restaurant where we met for our three year anniversary. 

Tomorrow I will also be proposing. 

I felt lost and alone but I would feel like that all again if it meant I have her in my life. I am super happy to have gotten her father’s blessing, as it means I get to possibly have her in the rest of my life. Don’t give up. To everyone, I hope y’all get what you want.
