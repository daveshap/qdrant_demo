HAGEN: Mike, why are you cutting me out of the action?
MICHAEL: Tom, we're going to be legitimate all the way, and you're the legal man. What could be more important than that.
HAGEN: I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about Rocco Lampone building a secret regime. Why does Neri report directly to you, rather than through me or a caporegime?
DON CORLEONE: I told you that it wouldn't escape his eye.
MICHAEL: How did you find out?
HAGEN: Bookkeepers know everything. Rocco's men are all a little too good for the jobs they're supposed to be doing. They get a little more money than the job's worth. Lampone's a good man; he's operating perfectly.
MICHAEL: Not so perfectly if you noticed.
HAGEN: Mike, why am I out?
MICHAEL: You're not a wartime Consigliere. Things may get tough with the move we're trying.
HAGEN: OK, but then I agree with Tessio. You're going about it all wrong; you're making the move out of weakness... Barzini's a wolf, and if he tears you apart, the other families won't come running to help the Corleones...
DON CORLEONE: Tom, I never thought you were a bad Consigliere, I thought Santino a bad Don, rest in peace. He had a good heart but he wasn't the right man to head the family when I had my misfortune. Michael has all my confidence, as you do. For reasons which you can't know, you must have no part in what will happen.
HAGEN: Maybe I can help.
