SPICOLI: Hey! Wait a minute! There's no birthday party for me here!
MR. HAND: Thank you, Desmond. What's the reason for your truancy?
SPICOLI: I couldn't make it in time.
MR. HAND: You mean, you couldn't? Or you wouldn't?
SPICOLI: I don't know, mon. The food lines took forever.
MR. HAND: Food will be eaten on your time! Why are you continuously late for this class, Mr. Spicoli? Why do you shamelessly waste my time like this?
SPICOLI: I don't know.
