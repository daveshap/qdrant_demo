RAY: I kinda lost track of how many people we killed that night. Must have been 15 or twenty -- not counting women and children. It was a real bloodbath. All that screaming...
CLAUDE: Pack of lies. Don't listen to him. We didn't kill nobody. We were railroaded. And we gonna prove that.
RAY: He just blocked it out. Nigger's crazy. He's the one who did all the stabbing. He's capable of some heinous shit. How 'bout him down there?
WILLIE: Goldmouth? They say he was born out back behind the shithouse. That's what they say.
RAY: You all been here a long time. Doesn't anybody ever escape from this place?
WILLIE: They run but they never get too far.
RADIO: Couple years back, Cookie made it clear to Greenville.
