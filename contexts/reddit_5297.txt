How to have a personality in order to get along with others?
I feel like I don't get along with others as well. I get angered pretty easily, irritated. I really try to not be an asshole or aloof but it just happens. How can i get along with others better so I can work? I don't want to be 'that guy'.   


It's just based on my past experience from working at odd jobs. I tend to be quiet, aloof, insecure, I just don't get along with others well..
