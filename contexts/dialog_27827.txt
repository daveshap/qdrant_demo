DON CORLEONE: Is it necessary?
HAGEN: You understand him better than anyone.
KAY: I've never seen anything like it.
MICHAEL: I told you I had a lot of relatives.
KAY: Michael, what are those men doing?
MICHAEL: They're waiting to see my father.
KAY: They're talking to themselves.
MICHAEL: They're going to talk to my father, which means they're going to ask him for something, which means they better get it right.
KAY: Why do they bother him on a day like this?
MICHAEL: Because they know that no Sicilian will refuse a request on his daughter's wedding day.
