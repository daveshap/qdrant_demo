Manually test computer Ethernet port with a multimeter I have updated the drivers for the ethernet port an a laptop at home, yet it is only letting 10 mbps through for every cable that is connected, even though Speed/Duplex was set to Dual 1 Gb. I now suspect that the port may have dead pins, so I wanted to see if I can test the pins. If possible, I would like to test with equipment that I already have, such as a multimeter. How can I go about testing this?Edit:I should quickly mention that all cables were tested and were working fine with other laptopsEdit 2:The Ethernet device I have on the laptop is the Realtek GBE FamilyDoing some more extensive checks, the Realtek Ethernet Diagnostic utility reports that each pair has a \"normal\" connection when a cable is plugged in, however pair 4-5 reports \"short\" when no cable is plugged in, while the other 3 pairs report that they are \"open\". Manual continuity testing shows that each pair does have continuity between the two pins of each.@jstola The cables that I have been working with were observed to have download speeds greater than 20 mpbs on various alternate devices. I also attempted to connect the laptop directly to the router with another cable (which was labeled cat 5e and worked the right speed on another device) and there was no such luck there.No matter what setting Speed &amp; Duplex is set to, it seems to fall back to 10 Mbps (as reported in link speed - under the networking tab in Task Manager)
