BARNES: What is it, Norman?
NORMAN: Take a look.
BARNES: It's chipped.
HARRY: Chipped? The door? How can it be chipped?
BARNES: I don't know how it can be chipped, but it's chipped.
HARRY: I thought you said there wasn't any damage done in the crash?
BARNES: I did.
HARRY: Then how can it be chipped?
BETH: There's heat coming the door.
BARNES: Back away then.
BETH: Wait a minute --
BARNES: I said back away.
BETH: Would you wait a minute?
BARNES: Ted, get her away from the door.
TED: What are you going to do -- shoot her?
