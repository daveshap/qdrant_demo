Set default pdf icon with Foxit Reader On macOs High Sierra I am trying to set a default icon for .pdf files: when I used Adobe Reader all the pdf files showed its icon, then I uninstalled it and replaced it with Foxit Reader as default app to open the same file. However all the pdf files now show a white icon and I would like them to show the Foxit logo instead.I tried to copy-paste the logo from Foxit to a random pdf and it does work, but this cannot be applied to the whole configuration (this means that I should copy-paste everytime the logo in every single pdf file).Is there a way to set the default icon?
