GREGORY: Good night, Jacqueline -- good night, Mary.
MARY: Good night.
JUDD: I'm afraid this is no time to play Cyrano, my friend. What was in your mind?
JASON: I wanted to get things clear for Jacqueline. Let her know --
GREGORY: Let her know what?
JASON: That you love Mary.
JASON: She'll have to know some time.
GREGORY: Not from me.
JUDD: I suppose, Jason, that you'll speak for your friend -- -- and your poetry will speak for you.
JASON: Perhaps
MARY: Good-bye, darling. I'll only be gone until three.
JACQUELINE: Good-bye.
MARY: If you get lonely, go down and see Mrs. Romari. I told her you were staying with me.
JACQUELINE: I won't get lonely.
MARY: You'll be all right?
JACQUELINE: Yes.
