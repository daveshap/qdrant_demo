JOE: Kiss the back of my knees.
SALLY: Through the sweats or not?
JOE: Not.
SALLY: What?
JOE: You didn't kiss anyone else's knees, did you?
SALLY: No. Did you?
JOE: No. I missed that.
SALLY: I missed all of you. We're okay, aren't we?
JOE: We're great.
SALLY: I mean, you're really back.
JOE: For good.
JOE: Don't get it.
SALLY: Well, it might be Clair. They're threatening not to come...
JOE: What?
SALLY: They can't find a sitter... Hello? Excuse me? Yes, uh, hold on. Just a moment. It's Skye Davidson. She needs directions to the house. You invited Skye fucking Davidson to our anniversary party?
JOE: Okay. I'm sorry, look, I meant to tell you. It was the only chance I had to meet her.
SALLY: You invited her to our anniversary party? I didn't even invite my mother.
JOE: She goes on location tomorrow. Sally, I'm sorry. Look, I can't keep her on hold.
SALLY: No, no of course not. It's Skye fucking Davidson, for fuck's sake.
JOE: You want me to uninvite her?
SALLY: No, no of course not. How old is she? Twenty-fucking-two?
SALLY: And she's a stinking fucking actress, for fuck's sake.
JOE: Skye! I'm so glad you're able to make it...it's our sixth, actually. You read the book again? Well, no, the ending to chapter six...it's just that it's not filmic. We tried it in an earlier draft, but, it just wasn't filmic... Well, sure, we can absolutely look at that again. If you're coming from Laurel, you want to take Sunset west, we're just past Will Rogers State Park. Three blocks west of that, you want to hang right. It's about three quarters of a mile up a big white thing on the left.
