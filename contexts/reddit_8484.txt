What is the core of the debate over releasing (or not releasing) some of Brett Kavanaugh's records?
Usually I'm pretty good at digging into issues like this and finding a reasonable explanation for at least one of the sides of a debate. But recently I've seen [articles](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/01/us/politics/kavanaugh-records.html) about a debate over some of Brett Kavanaugh's record, and I can't seem to find much of a basis for either side's arguments. I'm hoping that there's some more information out there that I'm missing to help me out with a few of my questions:

1) What is the role of the White House staff secretary, and how might documents generated by someone in that position be relevant to a confirmation hearing for a SCOTUS position? 

2) To what extent are the documents being withheld? All documents from his time as staff secretary, some, or are they only withholding them until they can be screened for sensitive information?

3) What sort of information might be in those documents? Is there any basis for wanting them released?
