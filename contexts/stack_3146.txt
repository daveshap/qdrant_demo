Do any of the creatures Xenophilius believes in actually exist? The books give an impression that Xenophilius Lovegood is a weirdo with crazy beliefs and ideas (he has an ornamental horn in his house he absolutely believes belongs to a Crumple-Horned Snorkack, which in reality turned out to be an Erumpent horn(or may be he was referring to an erumpent but just with a different name? )) but he believed in the Deathly Hallows and they turned out to be real.Did any other creatures (including plants, fruits, vegetables, bacteria, fungi, virus or any other magical and non magical things that can be considered \"living\") that Xenophilius or Luna believe to exist, actually exist in Harry Potter? For example:<blockquote>  Moon Frogs<br>  Blibbering Humdingers<br>  Crumple-Horned Snorkacks<br>  Heliopaths<br>  Umgubular Slashkilters<br>  Nargles<br>  Aquavirius Maggots<br>  Wrackspurts<br>  Gulping Plimpies<br>  Dabberblimps</blockquote>
