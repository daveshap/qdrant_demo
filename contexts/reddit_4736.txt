Year 23 of wanting to free fall off of a cliff
I’m so sick and tired of being alive, every year it gets worse and worse, I think about wanting to kill myself every day at this point. I feel like I’m stuck there’s no chance for me to ever get better, I don’t have the money to move, and I also don’t have a car. No friends, no family to go to, this all feels more like hell and I’m ready to just go and never come back.
