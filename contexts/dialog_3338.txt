EVE: Chauncey!
CHANCE: Hello, Eve.
EVE: Your leg must be getting better.
CHANCE: Yes. It's feeling much better now.
EVE: Good. I'm glad to hear that. ... How did you like meeting the President?
CHANCE: Fine. He's very nice.
EVE: Yes, he is. I'm sorry I didn't get to see him.
EVE: ... Chauncey... Last night you mentioned an old man, that died.
CHANCE: Yes.
EVE: Was he a relative? Or an intimate friend?
CHANCE: He was a very wealthy man, he looked after me since I was young.
EVE: Oh, I see... Your mentor, perhaps?
CHANCE: ... Mentor...?
EVE: Forgive me, Chauncey - I didn't mean to pry. You must have been very close to him.
CHANCE: Yes. I was.
EVE: I'm sorry... ... And what about Louise? YOU mentioned that she had gone, were you close to her also?
CHANCE: Yes. I liked Louise very much. She was his maid.
EVE: Oh, his maid!... Stupid me, I thought perhaps she was someone that you may have been romantically involved with.
CHANCE: Oh, no. She brought me my meals.
EVE: Of course.
CHANCE: What is that?
EVE: Our greenhouse.
CHANCE: Oh, I like that very much.
EVE: Yes, so do we.
