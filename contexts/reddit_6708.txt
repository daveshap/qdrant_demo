External Recruiter represented me in interview process but we realized a complication due to my previous application, how to proceed
I applied to a company through an external recruiter this month and have progressed somewhat far in the process but have not received an offer. There is still another 2 rounds of interview stages to go.


I had disclosed my previous familiarity with this prospective company with the external recruiter but did not mention that I applied directly 6+ months ago, because I did not think it was relevant (since at my current company I think it is a 3 month rule). Back then, I interviewed at the initial HR stage but did not progress further. I had received a fairly standard "unfortunately there were lots of qualified applicants blah blah" rejection email.


The external recruiter let me know today that my previous application complicates his ability to represent me. I have been in direct contact with the prospective company, and I've been relaying communications with the recruiter as well. The company wants to continue this direct contact with me.


The external recruiter and I have been in contact since mid-December about this position so understandably he may be very upset. 


What is the best solution here? Obviously I want to maintain a good relationship with both the prospective company (since I would like to continue to move forward in the interview process) and the external recruiter. I most likely wouldn't be where I am in the interview process without the recruiter help (since I wouldn't have re-applied).
