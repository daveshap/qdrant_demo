Being Positive Is The Dumbest Advice Ever
When you're depressed and on a bad luck streak, positive thinking makes things worse because it DOES NOT HELP AT ALL. In fact, it makes you more depressed because it just leads to more disappointment. 

The reality is negative or positive thinking isn't going to change any situation that has outside influences such as being in financial distress, jobless, homeless, or a bad relationship. You're purely dependent on the mercy of others. 

If you're depressed, don't waste time on positive thinking, words of affirmation, and all the other bs people try to suggest. It only makes you depressed. Just work hard, have no expectations and maybe the law of averages may swing your way at some point, just don't expect miracles or when you need it most.  

I know a lot of people don't want to hear this but it's the truth. Don't make yourself more depressed by lying to yourself and living in a false reality.
