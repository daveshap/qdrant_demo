Override and restore the normal functionality of Apple keyboard media keys in VLC? We're all used to the media keys in the top row of an Apple keyboard to command iTunes, even when some other application is frontmost. If I have VLC frontmost, those media keys don't control iTunes but work as \"next / previous\" in VLC, which is a rather annoying exception because not does it only make iTunes controlling unreachable, it's plain unnecessary because to navigate within the frontmost application, the norm is to use arrow keys, or cmd+arrow.How do I reserve the good old media keys for iTunes, always?I'm on Yosemite.
