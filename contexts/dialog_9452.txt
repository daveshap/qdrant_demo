JACK: That old saying, how you always hurt the one you love, well, it works both way.
JACK: We have front row seats for this Theater of Mass Destruction. The Demolitions Committee of Project Mayhem wrapped the foundation columns of ten buildings with blasting gelatin. In two minutes, primary charges will blow base charges, and those buildings will be reduced to smoldering rubble. I know this because Tyler knows this.
TYLER: Look what we've accomplised. Thirty seconds.
JACK: Somehow, I realize all of this -- the gun, the bombs, the revolution -- is really about Marla Singer.
