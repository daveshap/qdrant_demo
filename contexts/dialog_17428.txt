JOHN: Hello, Mr. Connell.
CONNELL: Hiyah, John. John, I want to have a little talk with you. What's the matterâ€”are you falling? Come here.
BEANY: Hey, Boss.
CONNELL: Oh, quiet, quiet, quiet. Say, tell me something did you read that speech you're gonna make tonight?
JOHN: No, I never read the speeches before I make them. I get more of a kick out of it that way.
CONNELL: Uh-huh. That's exactly what I thought. Beany, go on down to the office, tell Pop to give you the speech. There's a copy on my desk.
BEANY: Gee whiz, Boss, you know Mr. Norton told me not to leave him, not even for a minute.
CONNELL: Go on, go on, go on. And we'll be at Jim's Bar up the street.
