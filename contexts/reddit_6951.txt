Why did you get fired and how can you help others learn from your mistake?
Getting let go from a job is hands down one of the most disappointing experiences I have gone through in my lifetime. I constantly have “if only” thoughts, and find myself regretting the actions I made that resulted in my unemployment. 

I was let go of my dream job after 2 years because I lacked responsibility and stopped showing up to work on time because I got too comfortable and lazy and ignored the possible consequences. What is something that got you fired that you hope others don’t do so they don’t make the same mistake?
