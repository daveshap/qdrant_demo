Do some Red Sphere, Blue Sphere stages have more blue spheres than required? IIRC, the Red Sphere, Blue Sphere stages in S3&amp;K all required you to collect every one of the blue spheres on the stage. But I could swear I've had a few instances in Sonic Mania where I've finished a stage with blue spheres left in front of me. Do some of the later stages have surplus blue spheres?
