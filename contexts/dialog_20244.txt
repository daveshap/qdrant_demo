FAITH: Why not?
PETER: Because. I know where he is.
PETER: I went back to that restaurant and I spoke with his waiter, just on an off chance, you know, and, anyway-- he knew the name of the guy's hotel. So, I called there, they said he left yesterday. But, apparently he comes here every year, always follows the same route. He always goes from here down the coast to the Le Sirenuse hotel in Positano. I called. And they told me he's checked in.
FAITH: Where's Positano?
PETER: It's in the south. I've still got my rental car. I can get you there by morning...
FAITH: Oh no, I don't think that would be a good idea.
PETER: Look, I know there's no going back for us. That's not it. I just want to make this up to you. Clear my relationship karma. And I know the area, I've got some cousins down there. Please. Let me do this for you. Let this be my gift to you.
FAITH: Why?
PETER: Because-- I want you to be happy.
