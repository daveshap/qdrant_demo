How do I thank a recruiter that's been really good to me?
I signed up with a temp agency a few months ago, and the woman who has worked with me since day one has been amazing. She finds roles that are exactly what I'm looking for, and has been a good advocate on my behalf. She's really stellar at her job, and I'm super impressed. 

I'm taking a full-time job that I found on my own, but I really want to thank her for her good work (and come back to her should I need her again). What's something I can do to show my appreciation?
