VANESSA: Austin, we don't look anything like our photo badges.
AUSTIN: Don't worry, baby. I picked up a mind control technique during my travels to India. I learned it from my guru, the late Guru Shastri, a chaste man who mysteriously died of a disease that had all the hallmarks of syphilis. Just watch me. Watch me, now.
GUARD: Hi, folks. You're entering a restricted zone. Can I see your security badges?
AUSTIN: Sure.
