MAGGIE: Did something happen to make you care about reality?
IKE: Yes. Conviction. Conviction that I'm onto the truth. You're going to do the same thing to poor bastard number four" that you did to the last three. You're going to run again. And I'm not leaving until you do."
MAGGIE: You're going to be very disappointed.
IKE: We'll see.
MAGGIE: I'd love to stay and chat, but I've got to get back to work. I still have my job.
