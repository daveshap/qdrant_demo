What are the pros and cons of Hillary Clinton's plan to impose an exit fee for companies that go overseas?
Hillary Clinton's plan for [Ending Inversions and Investing in America](https://www.hillaryclinton.com/briefing/factsheets/2015/12/08/ending-inversions-and-investing-in-america/) is designed to prevent companies from moving their residence to foreign nations to avoid American taxes.

Would doing that stimulate more jobs in the US? Could the exit fee make it more difficult for small businesses to start up? It seems reasonable for big conglomerates in the energy and pharmaceutical companies, but could it restrict companies who try to enter the global market? What are the pros and cons of the proposal?
