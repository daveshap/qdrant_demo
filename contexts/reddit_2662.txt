How can I address or handle new boss making fun of me on social media?
Another user recommended I make a separate post for this from another thread I posted in here. Today will be my second day at my new dream career. Yesterday for my first day I didn’t feel so great because I felt the vibe with my new manager was a little off. Last night I was going to add my teammates on social media since everyone is connected in the company and it is encouraged to do so. I saw my manager’s social media page was not private. On her story she took a screenshot of my purse that I brought in yesterday saying, “yuck!!!”

Seeing that my manager is already saying things about me behind my back on day one demotivates me as I am going to be reporting to this person and the trust factor with myself is already declining. I did not add my manager on social media but I did take a screenshot of what she said. I feel awful because this is my dream job but I also do not want to deal with a manager like this if this is what she is capable of just after day one. 

What should I do? I feel bad for throwing in the towel so quick on a great opportunity but I don’t want to be disrespected by my own boss.
