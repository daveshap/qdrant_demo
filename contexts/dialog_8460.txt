ED: Erin, you've been gone for a week.
ERIN: I left a message. I've been dealing with that real estate thing. I was gonna write up a whole damn report and --
ED: That's not how we work here. You don't just leave a message and take off.
ERIN: What am I supposed to do, check in every two seconds?
JANE: Yes. It's called accountability.
ERIN: I am not talking to you, bitch.
JANE: <u>Excuse me</u>?
ED: Okay, enough -- Now, look, Erin -- this incident aside, I don't think this is the right place for you. So what I'm gonna do is make a few calls on your behalf. Find you something else, okay?
ERIN: Don't bother.
ED: Come on, I'm trying to help here.
ERIN: Bullshit. You're trying to feel less guilty about firing someone with three kids to feed. Fuck if I'll help you do that.
