SA Job Search Questions
Hi everyone! I started my job search in early March once I was done my Capstone and I was looking at areas within academic support including academic advising, success coaching, and even retention coaching. Now with COVID-19 going around, freezes going around and such, it has made me consider looking in other directions based on my experiences. I have had expereinces within Residence Life Leadership Education and Development, and Career Development. My questions for you all are: 

* If you were interested in particular functional areas or jobs, have you had to switch to other areas you not enjoy as much?
* What are some opportunities within academic support that synthesize with another functional area (i.e. Residence Life?)
