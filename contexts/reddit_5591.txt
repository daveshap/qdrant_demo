ELI5 what exactly a promotions and publicity manager does for a book publishing company?
There’s a job that I really want that I know I’d be good at for a publisher. And the job is what I mentioned in the title

It doesn’t ask for x of years of experience so I just want to give it a shot

Can one of you kind folks give a rundown on what this job is like on a day-to-day basis?

Thanks :)
