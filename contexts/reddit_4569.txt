Girlfriend is bullied by her parents and forced to give up on her dreams.
My girlfriend wanted to study gastronomy but her parents made comments like "You'll smell like onions, no one will look at you." "Have fun working at BK." etc. and she just gave up on everything. I tell her all kinds of positive things and how she can still chase her goals.  I keep telling her that it's her life and it shouldn't matter what they say but she totally convinced herself that she is good for nothing.  She is always bullied by her parents like this.

Yes we are still young and yes the relationship won't last forever but I don't care, I just want her to be happy in the future. Please help me with advices.
