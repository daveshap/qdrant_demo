Passive suicidalness
Does anyone else feel very detached from life? Not like in a "I want to die" way but "I wouldn't mind if I got hit by a car or contracted a terminal illness". 

I think my perspective comes from years of being depressed and actively suicidal, such that death really doesn't scare me or even really matter to me. It feels like living in an ocean, with no shore in sight - sometimes it peaceful, and the ocean is manageable. But sometimes there's a storm and it's all I can do to keep my head above water. And no matter how good I get at treading water, inevitably the only way to go is down.

I'm tired of treading water, tired of working so hard just to survive, tired of dreading the next storm.
