Can I programmatically output the same map with different shp files? I have 39 different .shp files of the same locations but different data values and I need to output a map for each of them.  Is there a way to build a map template and then run a process that will loop through each .shp file and output a map, either .pdf or .png, of the map template with the individual .shp files?
