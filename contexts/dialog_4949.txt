MAYOLIA: It's like...you've turned on.
WALTER: T-turned on?
MAYOLIA: A hot light bulb is burning inside of you. I want to be warmed by it.
WALTER: That's really nice of you Mayolia.
MAYOLIA: Let me into your world Walter... let me into that white hot inspired world.
WALTER: I can't. I gotta go home.
MAYOLIA: Well, I'll go home with you.
WALTER: Oh no, I couldn't do that. Mrs. Swicker would start asking questions. She's my landlady.
