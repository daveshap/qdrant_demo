European debit cards in Japan I will be traveling [from Austria] to Japan for two weeks soon.From searching online it seems that I should prepare a few hundred euros and convert them to Yen as soon as I get there, since my MasterCard and my EU debit card are not going to be very popular for these choices.But while the MasterCard is mentioned often (both on this site and elsewhere) as something that is sometimes being accepted, especially for larger purchases, there is no mention of debit cards (e.g. Maestro).Are there places in Japan, specifically Tokyo, to get cash using European debit cards? Or should I just assume there are none, and bring a wad of cash with me?
