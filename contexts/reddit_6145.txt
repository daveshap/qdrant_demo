What do you do if you've just joined a company and your manager assigns someone to train /supervise you and that someone appears incompetent or seems like they are unwilling to help?
I just joined a new company during this pandemic and as a result we are working from home. 

My direct manager has asked one of the colleagues that has been there for quite some time to show me the ropes but for some reason this colleague seems not to want to or maybe it's just pressure?

I work in the reinsurance broking industry.

What do y'all recommend I should do?
