A vent about finishing my dissertation with incomplete data
I’m disappointed in myself for the situation I’ve gotten myself in. I’m in my last year of my psychology PhD program and am planning to defend my dissertation over the summer. I should have had my data fully collected before Spring 2020 even began, but it just didn’t happen. 


It took me way longer than I expected to get the stimuli right, then I had poor recruitment of infants for my development work and slow sign-ups for my studies with undergraduates. With Covid, all research came to a halt in our department. But I can’t even blame Covid because I was in this situation when the semester started! One of my conditions with infants has 8 participants, and only 2 conditions (out of 10, across three studies) are complete. 


I’m disappointed that I don’t have more analyzable and interpretable data at this stage, in my sixth year of study (joint MA & PhD). Coming into grad school I had such high expectations for my research and my dissertation, but now it feels like I’m skating by on the bare minimum. I’m so thankful that my department is understanding, and I’m thankful that I can write from home without too many issues. But I know I could have prevented this and generated a stronger dissertation just by being more productive earlier in my graduate career.


Anyways, thanks for reading if you did!
