Force of Body Impact Upon Water So in 2014 I fell from 70 feet and landed flat on my back on slowly moving water (.5ft/sec) on the Willamette River. I weighed aproximately 190 pounds at the time. I was curious if someone would help me understand the amount of force my body experienced during the moment of inertia. It was enough to cause short-term internal bleeding lasting only about 10 seconds. I coughed up approximately half a pint to a full pint of blood. I didn't receive any medical attention afterward.I need this answer in a relatively simple format. Most of the terms I am using are what I found from using online calculators but I don't truly understand the terms, the answers, or the equations used to find them
