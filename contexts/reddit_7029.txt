Signs a Startup is Failing?
I got hired as a contractor three months ago at a startup. It's not a proper startup because they have an international presence, but the American branch is barely 6 months old. This is the second time they are trying to break into the American market after failing to do so in 2015/2016.

I really like the company and my coworkers, but lately I have become consumed by the idea that our branch is failing. There is absolutely zero leadership, which at first they pitched as a positive, but when they had a CEO candidate leave them at the altar after 3 interviews (including flying the person out to the international HQ), I started to fear that they were just clueless.

Without getting too specific, they recently launched a big new product feature, which isn't optimized for mobile. I was excited for this feature to launch, I was working to help make it happen, and then my jaw hit the floor when I realized that nobody had deisgned this feature with mobile in mind. Can't say how long that feature was in development for but I would guess over 6 months.

Last month (they only pay once a month which sucks), my paycheck was delayed by 9 days. I followed up and apparently my invoice was never submitted to accounting. My boss put me in touch with accounting and it was resolved the next day, but it still made me very nervous to be paid late. I tried writing that off as I'm a contractor and they're disorganized, but in combination with everything else, it feels ominous.

Today, I realized that our new registrations in January were less than half of what they were in September. I honestly don't think anybody else in my branch is even aware of this.

There's other things I could describe and you only have limited info but I am terrified this place is failing. Yet, just last week I was given a permanent ID, and just yesterday the snacks, soda and beer was restocked so what do I know?

TLDR: What are some signs a company is failing, particularly a startup?
