SHEPHERD: You wanna knock of f?
MARSHALL: No, no. I'm fine. What did the Speaker say?
SHEPHERD: He and the NRA don't like the wording.
DOHERTY: Apparently taking uzis away from sixth graders isn't as popular as we thought it'd be. Representative Taylor is working on a compromise.
MARSHALL: Put together a score sheet. I'll make some calls.
SHEPHERD: With all due respect, sir, maybe you should give them this one. Your numbers are still pretty low and you called in a lot of chips to nail Stravanavitch.
MARSHALL: I might still have a few chips left.
SHEPHERD: * We could always put you in a duck blind with a twelve gauge. The second amendment types'll love that.
MARSHALL: This is a crime bill, Shep. Killing a couple ducks won't get it through committee. Besides, Shep, I told you... I don't shoot babies and I don't kiss guns.
SHEPHERD: Other way around, sir.
MARSHALL: Right... Christ I'm tired. Do me a favor and keep me away from the press.
