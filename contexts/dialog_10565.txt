DOC: ... Bank President, three tellers and one guard...
CAROL: Usually on the right side as you go in.
DOC: Nail him first, be careful he doesn't panic and want to shoot somebody. Local police have one car, a rover, shouldn't be in the vicinity at the time we hit unless it's answering an emergency call... if the cop car shows up remember it doesn't have any automatic weapons. Only a shotgun braced on the dashboard. Get into a tight spot, you'll be out of range at forty yards. Then they're down to their side guns.
CAROL: For exits off Main Street.
DOC: Should be light traffic that time of day... the Bank Guard carries a .38. These will stop an M.2 at fifty yards.
DOC: Just in case someone gets a shot off.
RUDY: I worked ten years without one, I don't need one now.
DOC: Suit yourself.
RUDY: Okay. How many bank exits?
DOC: Two.
RUDY: What about the vault?
DOC: Chambers - Reilly. Time lock opens 20 minutes before they start doing business...
RUDY: Wire pull over?
DOC: One-inch stuff on a three-number combination.
RUDY: I'm good at that.
DOC: I 'm handling the fine stuff. You're back up all the way...
RUDY: Whatever you need.
DOC: Keep going over these. I don't want anybody getting lost.
CAROL: If we are clean Gollie will take us over at Nogales. If we are hot we'll have to try Laughlin at El Paso.
DOC: I'll hang on to these. We don't need them till we get to GollieÂ«s. Okay. Any questions?
RUDY: Aren't we going a little hard?
DOC: What do you have in mind?
RUDY: It's just a walk-in bank. You don't have to be Dillinger for this one.
DOC: Dillinger got killed.
