LLOYD: Let's get outta here. You want to?
DIANE: Yeah.
LLOYD: Are you comfortable?
DIANE: Yes. Are you shaking?
LLOYD: No.
DIANE: You're shaking.
LLOYD: I don't think so.
DIANE: You're cold.
LLOYD: I don't think I am.
DIANE: Then why are you shaking?
LLOYD: I don't know. I'm happy.
DIANE: Here are some blankets. This is a good song, this is a really good song.
JIM: Morning.
DIANE: Dad, I'm sorry.
JIM: You should be.
DIANE: I was irresponsible, I should have called.
JIM: You bet you should have called. You still live at home. Don't make me call the police at three-thirty in the morning, don't make me call hospitals.
DIANE: Dad, I'm so sorry. I know this is a bad time.
JIM: You've always called before, always. Now I'm not asking what you did, I just want to know that you're alright.
DIANE: I'm fine.
JIM: Do you wanna make things easier on me? Now tell me where you were because this is, this is bullshit. You can say anything to me, I hope you still know that.
DIANE: I know that.
JIM: Lloyd?
DIANE: Dad, yes. And I'm scared to death of what you must think of me right now.
JIM: Sit down.
