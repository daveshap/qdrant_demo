ETHAN: You're going to use Walter?
PHELPS: He's our guy.
ETHAN: Isn't he chairing the Armed Services hearing?
PHELPS: Not this week. This week he's flyfishing at the Oughterard Slough in County Kildare, with one of our best Irish guides.
ETHAN: He won't be back in a hurry?
PHELPS: No, not in a hurry. What do you think? You think the plot'll work?
ETHAN: Sure. If the main character does.
PHELPS: If you were me, Ethan, who would <u>you</u> trust to make him believable?
JACK: Sorry, am I interrupting?
ETHAN: Always.
