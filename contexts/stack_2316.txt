Armor/weapon bin slots Since I am planning on acquiring every weapon (maxed out variations, not the low level ones) as well as all the high rank armors, I was wondering if there is a cap on how many weapons/armors I can have. At the blacksmith, there are only like 4 pages shown. These 4 pages can pretty easily be filled, even more with new monster coming along. So my question is, is it possible to acquire every weapon/armor in the game and store them?
