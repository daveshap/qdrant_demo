ALICE: What'd you see?
BRENDA: I don't know. Marcie's got me paranoid.
BILL: It still hurts?
ALICE: I walked into it knowing I'd get hurt, but I thought I could stand anything. I just wasn't ready for that kind of pain. We were supposed to meet in L.A. When I got back there, he sent a telegram saying he was going back to his wife.
BILL: What'll you do when you leave here?
ALICE: I don't know.
