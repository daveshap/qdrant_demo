MULEY: Gone-- --over to your Uncle John's. The whole crowd of 'em, two weeks ago. But they can't stay there either, because John's got *his* notice to get off.
TOM: But what's happened? How come they got to get off? We been here fifty years--same place.
MULEY: Ever'body got to get off. Ever'body leavin', goin' to California. My folks, your folks, ever'body's folks. Ever'body but me. I ain't gettin' off.
TOM: But who done it?
MULEY: Listen! That's some of what done it--the dusters. Started it, anyway. Blowin' like this, year after year--blowin' the land away, blowin' the crops away, blowin' us away now.
TOM: Are you crazy?
MULEY: Some say I am. You want to hear what happened?
TOM: That's what I asked you, ain't it?
