I have super religious parents, help?
My parents are extremely religious and as I am ftm trans and bisexual, they disapprove and are actively angry at me the majority of the time. I’m 15 and I just came out to them and they refuse to acknowledge it or refer to me as my preferred name/pronouns, though the but of information I’ve gotten from my mom was one time when she said “it’s not how we raised you” before my dad cut her off. This leads me to believe it’s because of their toxic Christianity. They have always mocked me and we constantly get into huge arguments over me being agnostic. I don’t know how to get them to listen to my side with out yelling at me and they refuse to let me start testosterone or even get a binder. They think if they ignore it that it’ll just fix itself and I won’t be trans anymore. I don’t know what to do, does anyone have a similar experience that they’ve gotten through and have advice?
