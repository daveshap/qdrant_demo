MRS. SWICKER: What's all the noise in here!
WALTER: Noise Mrs. Swicker? What noise?
MRS. SWICKER: Don't tell me I didn't hear a racket! I'm an older woman and I don't need to be upset and disturbed in this manner!
WALTER: I was just straightening up the place.
MRS. SWICKER: Straightening up indeed! Are you sure you're not alone?
WALTER: I'm always alone, Mrs. Swicker, you know that.
MRS. SWICKER: Walter have you been talking to yourself again?
WALTER: Well yes I guess I have been Mrs. Swicker. Somebody's got to.
