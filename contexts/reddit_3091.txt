Stuck in a low paying job and a niche industry for 7 years. is it a good idea to take a slow half-year or one-year break if one has little financial burden for rest and new skills?
Just to see if anyone has similar ideas.

and i am really glad if anyone has one of those gap years, get back on track later, or even turn their life round positively
