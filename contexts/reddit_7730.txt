salary negotiations at non-academic job interviews
The short version of my question is, does anyone have experience negotiating salaries after working as a graduate research assistant, and will I be laughed out of the room for trying to convince them that the amount of my tuition waiver should be considered part of my salary?  I was required to submit my salary history with my application, and I told them my compensation included a tuition waiver.

For context:

Pay range for the job is about $44,000 - $81,000

My pay for the last three years (for a university fellowship) has been $25,000 plus a tuition waiver that (at least on paper) is worth $45,000 per year

So, without the tuition waiver, the lowest pay for this new position is nearly double my current stipend, but including the waiver means I currently get paid about $70,000 per year.  

I'm considering asking for $70,000 to match my current "pay", but I'd really be pretty happy with anything above $60,000.

The job seems to require a lot of data analysis and presentation, but it's for the state government, so pay is low.

So much talk of money in this post.  I know, I know, so gauche ;)
