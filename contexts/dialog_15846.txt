EMMETT: Okay, how would it work?
ELLE: It would be a full-service law firm, by and for blondes, providing positive blonde role models and community outreach in high blonde areas. I mean, think about it -- name one blonde intellectual role model.
EMMETT: I can't.
ELLE: That is a direct result of anti- blonde discrimination!
EMMETT: Wait -- Hilary Clinton.
ELLE: If she were a true blonde, she would've left the cheating bastard. Blondes don't let their husbands get fellated by brunettes and live to tell about it.
EMMETT: In that case, maybe Heyworth got fellated by a brunette and Brooke caught him.
ELLE: Exactly how much gorilla sex do you think a sixty-year-old man can take?
EMMETT: That's not really a topic that keeps me up at night -- but maybe it should.
