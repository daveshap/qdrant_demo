How to break into the field of human resources?
I just graduated with an undergrad in an unrelated discipline. I want to begin a career in HR and have found many universities that offer a post-degree HR management certificate or diploma (program entry only requires a degree in any field). So, my question is, is this post-degree program the best way to break into the HR field for a degree carrier? Any advice is appreciated.
