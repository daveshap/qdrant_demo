How should I respond to this promotion ultimatum from my boss?
A little background: In late 2018, my partner and I were planning to move across the country because 1) we hated our jobs 2) our landlord told us he would not renew our lease and was selling our building and 3) the train line we live off of was supposed to shut down the following year. 

That month I ended up accepting my current job through someone in my network with total transparency about my plans (the company said they didn't care if I needed to leave four months in). As life had it, our landlord changed his mind about selling the building and the city decided not to shut down our train line.

I've now been at my job since October 2018, and my boss (the one who brought me on) was fired in June 2019.  Since then, I've been handling all of her duties and been a de facto member of our company's C-suite, without any raise, promotion, or official acknowledgement. Including me in these conversations resulted in me leading two company-wide primary initiatives that have turned the business around.

I've repeatedly asked for a promotion, and finally my CEO/(new) boss has told me point-blank that he won't give me the promotion unless I agree not move in 2020.

Meanwhile, my partner still hates his job and we both feel we'll want to finally move next year (we'll likely start our job hunts next month and hope to move by midyear).

I feel frustrated that, if I'm honest with my boss, my resume will show zero growth and I'll have been doing a C-level job without compensation for almost a calendar year. If I lie, I'll burn a bridge with my boss and force some of my colleagues (who I care about) to endue some chaos if they restructure my team and then I immediately leave. 

My partner said it's business and I should lie, but I'm a terrible liar and hate the idea of screwing anyone over. Any advice is much appreciated!
