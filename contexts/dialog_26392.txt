BRAD: Yeah? What do you want?
GUS: Buddy, are we in trouble.
BRAD: What?
GUS: First the supplier couldn't find the invoice. Then the order came up short. Then I missed the four o'clock plane from Cleveland and had to rent a car, and then I got a darn flat tire on the highway! Can you beat it? Boy, your boss must've been furious when I didn't show up by the end of the day today, huh?
BRAD: What are you talkin' about?
GUS: Good lord, fella! I'm talking about your boss.
BRAD: Mr. Roebush?
GUS: Roebush! That's the guy! Buddy, he's gonna nail our behinds to the wall! this is Special Order! He said he had to have it before... Omigod!! What's tomorrow?
BRAD: Tuesday.
GUS: TUESDAY! I got to get it all set up in his office tonight before all those big shots come here tomorrow for the meeting!!
