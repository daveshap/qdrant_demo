EPPS: What are you doing?
JAEGER: What does it look like I'm doing?
EPPS: It looks like you're not doing anything.
JAEGER: I'm not. And I'm not doing anything, because there's nothing down here.
EPPS: Get up and dig.
JAEGER: We've been digging. We've been digging for hours. If there was anything here to find we would have found it.
EPPS: Get up off your ass and dig!
