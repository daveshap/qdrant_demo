LETTY: I did this already.
DR. EMLEE: It's hospital policy...
DR. EMLEE: I'm the only doctor making rounds this morning.
LETTY: Well, I don't have hallucinations. Honest.
DR. EMLEE: This doctor, was he tall, with dark hair?
LETTY: Yeah, and a dimple.
DR. EMLEE: I'm afraid Lhe's not a doctor.
LETTY: Psychologist, therapist, whatever.
DR. EMLEE: Patient.
LETTY: What?
LETTY: What kind of place is this?
DR. EMLEE: I apologize for the inconvenience, but I must ask you some...
LETTY: I want to see my mother immediately.
DR. EMLEE: We discourage family visits for the first 48 hours after an emotional trauma like the kind you've experienced.
LETTY: I don't think you understand. I won't wait.
