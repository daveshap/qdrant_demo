My mom found.. indecent photos on my phone.
Background: I'm 14 YO, come from an african background. My parents have rules that my peers see as ridiculous - \*\*\*sleeping\*\*\* by 8, which implies bedtime is 7:30 PM, no going out with friends unless one of my parents are there, ZERO PRIVACY for the children(We know all your passwords, we randomly check your texts, you get punished if you lock a door), et cetera. I have a phone, I'm 14 years old, did what any 14 year old male would do with access to such pictures and tickled the pickle. My mom took my phone in the middle of the night, found out, and subsequently flipped out. My parents are heavily religious, although I don't agree with Christianity in the slightest - to me, the whole thing is just an unreliable telling of a fairy tale. If you do anything bad in the 80-ish years you have to live, and despite the monumental evidence telling you god doesn't exist and you believe that he doesn't exist, he will send you to a place of fire and flames and pain and death for the rest of eternity - but he *loves* you. I'm currently waiting for my fate - it's like 9:something PM and I'm only awake because of this - \*what do?\* If I bring up the whole "Puberty causes an increase in libido" thing, they're \*constantly\* going to reflect with "But god said no lmao". They're going to refuse to listen to what I have to say so they can hear what they want to hear - what can I do in this situation?  


\*quick edit - more words to describe how ridiculous I think religion is as a whole\*
