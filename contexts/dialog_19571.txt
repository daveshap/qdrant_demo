MOM: Jess?
JESSE: Huh?
MOM: Eggs?
JESSE: Oh...uh, no, just some milk, Mom.
MOM: You okay?
JESSE: Yeah, I'm fine. Just really hot upstairs.
MOM: I know it's warm... I wish you'd call someone to check out the air conditioning, Ken.
DAD: I know what's wrong with the air coditioning - just needs a shot of freon, is all.
JESSE: Dad's fixin' something again. Hit the deck!
DAD: Don't be a smart ass.
MOM: So, school going alright?
JESSE: Okay, I guess.
MOM: Making friends?
