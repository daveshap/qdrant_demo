I miss enjoying my hobbies
For a while now, I've had very low energy and motivation to do things I used to love. Reading, drawing, painting, playing the piano... I just dont have interest in engaging in my hobbies anymore. But I want to be able to enjoy them again!

I've tried scheduling time to do some of these things each week, but it has just made me dread doing them even more, as if they were more chores. 

I'm interested to hear what techniques and skills worked for you to be able to enjoy life again.
