ERIN: ... and when I realized our area's just as bad as Hinkley, I thought maybe my neighbors are all sick too. So I went and asked.
PAULSEN: You did?
ERIN: Uh-huh. Spent the last few days knocking on doors. And you know what? They're not. I mean, they got problems, but none of this cancer stuff. And their pets are fine. So I don't know -- I just can't shake the feeling that it wasn't no multivitamin they put in the water.
PAULSEN: Well, if you're talking about contamination, you're getting out of my area of expertise. Let me give you the name of a toxicologist friend of mine over at USC.
PAULSEN: I gotta say, Erin -- first time I saw you, I did not peg you as the kind to go off and conduct her own epidemiological study.
ERIN: Don't go telling anyone. It'll ruin my reputation.
FRANKEL: What kind of chromium is it?
ERIN: There's more than one kind?
FRANKEL: Yes. There's straight-up chromium -- does all kinds of good things for the body. There's chrom 3, which is fairly benign, and then there's chrom 6, hexavalent chromium, which, depending on the amounts, can be very harmful.
ERIN: Harmful, like -- how? What would you get?
FRANKEL: With repeated exposure to toxic levels -- God, anything, really -- respiratory disease, liver failure, heart failure, reproductive failure, chronic headaches, bone or organ deterioration -- plus, of course, any type of cancer.
ERIN: So that stuff -- it kills people.
FRANKEL: Oh, yeah. Definitely. Highly toxic, highly carcinogenic. Bad, bad stuff.
ERIN: Well, how do I find out what kind of chromium is up in Hinkley?
FRANKEL: Have you been to the water board?
ERIN: Hunh-uh. What's that?
FRANKEL: Every county has one. They keep records of anything water-related within their jurisdiction. You should be able to find something there.
ERIN: County water board. All righty, thanks.
FRANKEL: Good luck. Oh -- I wouldn't advertise what you're looking for if I were you ...
