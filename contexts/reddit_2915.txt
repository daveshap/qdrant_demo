How did this guy get hired? Should i escalate him?
New guy from other department got hired into my department.

Hes only 1 year but is getting paid handsomely compared to the rest of us because of his qualification.

He earns 80k total compensation a year but no knowledge of tools and workflow, makes mistakes and probably going to miss the quarterly goals i set for him.

How did he get hired? I am his colleague whos had 7 years industrial experience but his paycheck almost similar to mine because i didnt have a masters degree. i did all the work and have to pass down everything he needs to do his work. Its so tiring, but have to do it because boss asks me to.
