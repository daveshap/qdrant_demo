Risking being fired for reasons outside my control?
Can you get fired if you call in to work because your car won’t start and you’re stuck in another city for two days? Going by Texas laws. I let my assistant manager know 8 hours before my next shift was to start (because that’s when I had got the information), and she says that there’s nobody to cover me and it’s a holiday weekend, so I need to show up, else I could be fired. It’s not my fault that my car broke down (Someone stole the starter out of it while I was asleep, idk how), and it’s not my fault that my employer can’t keep employees. I’m their longest term employee, I’ve only ever called in once before because I was flooded in, and I’m the only person trained to work nightshift (Which is a solo shift I’ve been doing for a bit over 11 months, and haven’t gotten any time off I’ve requested in around 9 months). The store itself is understaffed because they always scare off new employees and the store manager is on maternity leave, leaving just the two assistant managers in charge of the store. Can they/will they fire me?
