"But you are just 30, you still have your whole life ahead of you."
LOL, you serious? It's not that i'm just 30yo, it's that i'm ALREADY 30yo and there is pretty much no chances of fixing my fucking life anymore, can't you fucking understand that?!

I have no fucking skills, no friends (never had), never had a relationship, got fired from the jobs i had, have a garbage ass curriculum, anxiety, depresson, childhood traumas, tinnitus, getting fat, have no savings, no will, no motivation or purpose in this fucking life. I find it funny with this fucking bullshit of "only 30yo", i'm fucked, there is literally zero chance of me being able to fix my life and being able to function like a normal or semi-normal human being. Fuck this garbage ass existence, fuck this planet, this country, my parents, fuck this bad joke called life.
