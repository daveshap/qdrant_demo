Early (pre-1994) Warhammer 40K Space Marine novel about three central characters becoming battle brothers I read this some time before 1994 so my memory is hazy.If I recall correctly it has three central characters who are from different, warring gangs representing different tiers of a Hive City. They are then recruited by an Astartes chapter and in the first part of the book we follow their induction, training and transformation from mortal enemies into fully fledged battle brothers.The thing I remember most is one of them filigree's his finger bones to honour the memory of his two fallen brothers.I've looked through the lists of Warhammer 40K novels and no titles or story descriptions seem to match. This is also, as far as I know, not part of The Horus Heresy cycle of books.
