GAIL: You don't have a brain tumor. He didn't say you had a brain tumor. MICKEY No, naturally they're not gonna tell you, because, well, you know, th--, sometimes the weaker ones will panic if you tell 'em.
GAIL: But not you.
MICKEY: Oh, God! Do you hear a buzzing? Is there a buzzing?
GAIL: Mickey, come on, we got a show to do!
MICKEY: I can't keep my mind on the show.
GAIL: But there's nothing wrong with you.
MICKEY: If there's nothing wrong with me then why does he want me to come back for tests?!
GAIL: Well, he has to rule out certain things.
MICKEY: Like what?! What?
GAIL: I don't know. Cancer, I--
MICKEY: Don't say that! I don't want to hear that word! Don't mention that while I'm in the building.
GAIL: But you don't have any symptoms!
MICKEY: You--I got the classic symptoms of a brain tumor!
GAIL: Two months ago, you thought you had a malignant melanoma.
MICKEY: Naturally, I, I--Do you know I--The sudden appearance of a black spot on my back!
GAIL: It was on your shirt!
MICKEY: I--How was I to know?! Everyone was pointing back here.
