CARTER: Goddamn you got a small ass.
LEE: Don't look at my ass!
SPECIAL AGENT STERLING: Chin, you have been ordered by the Ministry of Public Security to assist the FBI and Secret Service with our investigation, to provide us with whatever we need. If you have information, it belongs to us.
SUPERINDENDENT CHIN: This is still Hong Kong.
SPECIAL AGENT STERLING: Two Americans have been killed on United States Government property -- this is our investigation.
SUPERINDENDENT CHIN: Chief Inspector Lee will brief your people...
SPECIAL AGENT STERLING: No. He will report to me. Do we understand each other?
SPECIAL AGENT STERLING: Who the hell is that?
SUPERINDENDENT CHIN: That is...Chief Inspector Lee. The detective in charge of our investigation.
SPECIAL AGENT STERLING: Put a diaper on him, Chin. I want to talk to the great Inspector Lee.
LEE: Where are you going?
CARTER: Back to Heaven on Earth. I need my damn passport back. I'm going home.
LEE: Fine. Go home. Who needs you.
CARTER: Why you mad at me? You needed back-up, so I backed you up. I was about to take out Ricky Tan and those bodyguards.
LEE: Stop! I'm sick of your bullshit!
CARTER: My bullshit? I'm not the one who goes to a karaoke bar filled with gangsters! I'm not the one who goes to massage parlors to bust crime lords!
LEE: It's my job!
CARTER: You're pathetic, man. When's the last time you had some fun? When's the last time you took a night off, had a date?
LEE: I have plenty of dates.
CARTER: Really? When's the last time you had some Mu-shu Let's hear it, Lee, when was it? Year of the rat?
LEE: You would never understand my life. You're not Chinese.
CARTER: And you ain't black!
SUPERINDENDENT CHIN: Lee, this is Special Agent Sterling from the United States Secret Service.
LEE: The Secret Service? Why?
