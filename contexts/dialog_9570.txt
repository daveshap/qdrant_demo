CLEAR: Kimberly Burroughs, eh? What do you want?
KIMBERLY: I thought...I thought you might be able to help me.
CLEAR: Yeah, how?
KIMBERLY: I had a premonition about the Route 18 pile up... I saved some people. And now I think Death is after me.
CLEAR: Nice work. Maybe if you're real lucky, you'll wind up in here with me. But I doubt you'll survive that long.
KIMBERLY: It's not just about me. Someone I saved died last night in a freak accident. What if the others are in danger, too?
CLEAR: Well, if you put them on the list, they're already tits up.
KIMBERLY: What list?
CLEAR: Death's list. The precise order you're going to die in.
CLEAR: The survivors of Flight 180 died in the exact order they were originally meant to die in the plane crash. That was Death's original design.
KIMBERLY: Exact order? Then I'm next! I was meant to die with my friends, so I'm next!
