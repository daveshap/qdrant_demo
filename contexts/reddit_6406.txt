Any advice would be appreciated.
So as of right now I am working 2 jobs. One I hate and the other I enjoy. Both are only part time, but one pays more than the other.

A little background first. I went to Culinary School and ended up dropping out due to depression and family illness. I have worked as a cook/line cook for 10 years, and have 2 years of management experience. I walked out of my job in early 2013 and spent 8+months searching for work. I finally got a job washing dishes at the local Denny's for minimum wage. 3 days after I got the job, I was contacted by a grocery store that I had put in application in and forgotten about. I went through hiring process and was hired making $8.50 an hour. I was thrilled. Fast Forward 2 months and I am regretting having 2 jobs. I work til 11pm at denny's then have to go to work at the grocery store at 6am sometimes 5am. I am working about 45 hours a week now and maybe get 1 day off a week.

  I absolutely dread going to work at Denny's. I work 4 days (now that they cut my hours) usually only 5-6 hours shifts. The only thing I dread about working at the grocery store is the lack of sleep I have between the 2 jobs. 

  I really want to quit Denny's but I feel obligated to them because they gave me a job after 8 months of searching. I just don't see a future with them, because I realize I can make more money elsewhere. They want me to become a cook for them, but they want me to do the online training on my time. (Which I don't have much of.)

Sorry for the wall of text just need some kind of advice. TL;DR I have 2 jobs and hate 1, but feel obligated to quit the job I hate.
