JACK: I'm afraid it may storm.
LILI: Let it. Haven't you a cozy bower we might hide in?
JACK: Tis not fit for a princess.
LILI: Be it fit for your wife, Green Jack?
JACK: I have no wife.
LILI: Then, perchance you'll me.
JACK: If wishes were horses even beggars would ride.
LILI: Do you wish it, Jack? Wish you this our wedding band?
JACK: What if I answer yes? Will my wish come true?
