How to keep my cash drawer in balance? HELP!! (Bank teller)
So I’ve been working at a bank for about 2 1/2 months. Been handling transactions for about 2 months. For some reason I can’t seem to balance. My bank has a rule where anything $3.00 and under doesn’t count against you. 

Anytime I’m receiving cash or giving cash, I always count it to myself out of the drawer, count it out loud, run it through our counting machine and count it out loud to the customers. I also track everything I receive/give to the customers onto the computer. 

For the past couple of weeks I’ve been at least short/over 3.00 and it’s super frustrating!!! I do everything I’m supposed and I somehow still end up with my cash drawer being out of balance :( 

Any advice on what I could do to preventing this from happening?
