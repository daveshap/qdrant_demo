Academic anxiety impacting performance
So I struggle with clinical anxiety and a few other fun diagnoses, but have been very well managed the last couple years with medications and therapy. I’ve worked through a lot of the things that caused me great distress in undergrad, but it all seems to be resurfacing.

This mostly manifests and getting worried about things not being good enough and then the intensity of the feelings making it difficult to focus. This leads to hours of crying and procrastination when the assignments themselves (once I’m calm) don’t take very long or were far less difficult than I had made them out to be.

If anyone has any tips for working through similar feelings, I’d love to hear them. I am actively working on these things with my therapist, but would like some peer recommendations as well.
