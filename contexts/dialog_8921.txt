SUSIE: Oh, sorry. With the light always on, it's hard to tell.
JACK: It's okay. Last one.
SUSIE: Can't sleep?
JACK: In and out.
SUSIE: It's the waves. God's music, my mother used to say. She was crazy for the ocean.
JACK: Yeah, well, I wish God would go a little easy on the trumpets.
SUSIE: How's egghead?
JACK: Like a baby. You?
SUSIE: In and out.
SUSIE: If you want, I got a pack in the room.
JACK: No thanks. I never touch French cigarettes.
JACK: What the hell are you doing?
FRANK: What's it look like I'm doing? I'm tuning a goddamn piano.
JACK: Really.
FRANK: Yes, really. I don't want you to be unhappy, Jack. If you say it's out of tune, it's out of tune.
JACK: How's it coming?
FRANK: Fine.
JACK: How long you been at it?
FRANK: Half-hour. Once I finish this octave I'm gonna get breakfast. You see what's on the buffet?
JACK: They stopped serving two hours ago.
FRANK: Two hours ago!
JACK: Time flies, huh?
