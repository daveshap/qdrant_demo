I just got a $4,500 performance bonus and a $1,700 raise and it couldn’t have come at a better time.
I’m out of cards today so balance transfers. I have 11k in credit cards and one card with $4,400 on it. I’m going to use that bonus money to pay that card off.

October backtracked because over $2,000 of unexpected things came up. Slowly I’m digging myself out of this hole..
