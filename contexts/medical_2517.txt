Ultrasound - Transvaginal, EXAM:, Transvaginal ultrasound.,HISTORY:, Pelvic pain.,FINDINGS:, The right ovary measures 1.6 x 3.4 x 2.0 cm. There are several simple-appearing probable follicular cysts. There is no abnormal flow to suggest torsion on the right. Left ovary is enlarged, demonstrating a 6.0 x 3.5 x 3.7 cm complex cystic mass of uncertain etiology. This could represent a large hemorrhagic cyst versus abscess. There is no evidence for left ovarian torsion. There is a small amount of fluid in the cul-de-sac likely physiologic.,The uterus measures 7.7 x 5.0 cm. The endometrial echo is normal at 6 mm.,IMPRESSION:,1. No evidence for torsion.,2. Large, complex cystic left ovarian mass as described. This could represent a large hemorrhagic cyst; however, an abscess/neoplasm cannot be excluded. Recommend either short interval followup versus laparoscopic evaluation given the large size and complex nature.obstetrics / gynecology, ultrasound, pelvic pain, transvaginal, cul-de-sac, cystic mass, echo, endometrial, flow, follicular cysts, hemorrhagic cyst, laparoscopic, neoplasm, ovarian, ovary, uterus, transvaginal ultrasound, complex cystic, torsion,
