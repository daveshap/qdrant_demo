I did something!
For the past year I have been wanting to make a youtube video! And guess what?!?! I did it! TODAY! It's a shitty video, not edited, and all over the place. But I did it and I'm proud of myself. I have had depression and anxiety for so long but today I'm tired of letting them hold me back. I'm holding myself accountable for all the shit I haven't done and I'm getting to it.
