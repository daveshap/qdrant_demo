You guys make me feel less alone
I know it may seem pathetic and there are so many other people like me on here but reading your guys posts I see that everyone else’s life is just as struggling as mine. I suffer from social anxiety and I’m bipolar. I’m quite young and I haven’t experienced much but all my life I’ve felt different. I’ve been picked on, looked at differently, and talked about. I have a couple of close friends but even then they make me feel bad about myself. I’m so used to it by now since it’s been happening all my life so it’s easy to just brush off. I just take everything in and ignore it and it works but sometimes it catches up to me. Looking here I realize that I’m not alone in my struggle so thank you guys for making me feel connected.
