I hate when you drink caffeine to get energized, but instead just get a panic attack and consequently wiped out...
This happened to me today

Needed the energy to get some work done. Instead, got a panic attack mid lunch with coworkers...

Played it off really well, but I feel like trash now.

Oh well
