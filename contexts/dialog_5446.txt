SELINA: You know, now that I hear myself tell it, I'm thinking maybe both of you are messing with me. What, you get the Helmet Monday through Thursday, then Brock takes it for the weekend...
LANE: Okay. Let's get serious. Of course I know the Cult of Good is not good. Ever since I saw what they did in Atlanta, it has been my mission to expose them. I've followed them to Oasisburg and soon will have enough hard evidence to bring them to real justice. That computer disc could be the final piece to the puzzle. This isn't just a story, Selina--another damn Pulitzer--this is my life.
LANE: We're waiting.
BROCK: Quiet, Blender Boy. I told you from the beginning, Selina, I'm not a very good liar. I am not Captain God, or whatever else he may be calling himself this month, but when I find out who is--The Man will pay. My sister died in that Museum attack. You can check the Atlanta obituaries. I've tracked these monsters from city to city, waiting for a time to exact my revenge. Why else would I come to Oasisburg and create the most obnoxious casino in the world?
LANE: Did you ever think that maybe neither of us is Captain God?
SELINA: No-o. You know, questions like that don't help your cause--
BROCK: I still can't get over it. I still can't believe you're Catwoman..
LANE: I can. That's not an admission of guilt, It's just..I knew you had it in you...
BROCK: It may be time to get the police involved...
SELINA: Have you seen the Oasisburg Police? They drive golf carts with little red sirens.
LANE: We have to do something. What can we do to help, Selina?
SELINA: I'll let you know.
