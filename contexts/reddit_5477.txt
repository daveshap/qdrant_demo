Trying to find Job after running Small Business
Hello all,

  
I am currently in a grey area when it comes to looking for a job, as of right now I have my masters in public administration and B.S. in health care administration. For the past 4 years I've been working under a relative running (Vice President of Operations) a small shipping business here in New York. I'm having a little trouble trying to translate on my resume my experience and how I can work in a team setting. One job I applied to last year mentioned that I was overqualified for a position that I thought I'd be perfect for. I have logistics, HR , operations management, contract procurement and a lot of administrative experience . How should I go about articulating my experience and what level of management should I apply for going forward?
