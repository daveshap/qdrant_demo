AITA for having shitty stats and still applying to Harvard
So my friend called me an showoff today for applying to Harvard even though I don't have great stats. So what I only have a 4.76 out of the maximum 4.8 GPA possible to get at our school, and I only got a 1590 on the SAT. Sure I only founded 3 nonprofits, and have only ever had a meeting with Obama once. I mean, I get it's not that impressive to be the varsity captain of the tennis and cross country team as a freshman, and to be the drum major for the band as a sophmore, but I still feel like I might as well shoot my shot and hope. Other ECs/stats(as if it matters, none of them are that impressive): president of local NHS chapter, DECA state president, NSHS, NMHS, 14 AP classes(5s in all of them), class rank: 1/3000, built a water supply line in the middle east, fluent in 4 living languages and 2 dead ones. Also important to note: Native American first generation college student in a household with an income of -$12000. So, AITA?
