BEN: I made you some cocoa. See?
RACHEL: Thank you Ben. That was so sweet of you. Goodnight Annabelle. Sweet dreams.
RACHEL: &quot;In the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon...&quot;
BEN: Aren't you going to drink your cocoa? It's the good kind.
RACHEL: Mmmm! Tasty. You're a master chef Ben. Just like your dad.
RACHEL: &quot;Goodnight moon, goodnight hush, goodnight mush, goodnight goodnight goodnight Gracie -- Goodnight Ben!
BEN: No! You're cheating -- you have to start from the beginning and you have to read the whole thing I can't sleep otherwise.
RACHEL: &quot;In the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon...&quot;
BEN: &quot;And a picture of the cow jumping over the moon...&quot;
RACHEL: That's nice Ben.
