PAUL: Hello.
JENNIE: Hello Paul. Is Telly inside?
PAUL: Is Telly there? This is Paul. Who is this?
JENNIE: It's Jennie. Just tell me if Telly is there.
PAUL: Oh hi Jennie. Do you want to come make out with me?
JENNIE: I'm fucking serious. Where's Telly?
PAUL: Telly's not here right now. I believe he went downtown. Casper too.
