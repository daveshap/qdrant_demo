DENBY: I won't--I'll ask for one right now. Sally tells me she's in love with you.
BRETT: She did?
DENBY: Yes--but don't ask me why--because I could never tell you. I don't know what most guys want out of life--but <U>that</U> would be enough for me--I wouldn't care about-- easy money--or--showing off my smart brains--I'd just like to live <U>my</U> life so nothing I did would bounce back and ruin <U>hers</U>--Do I make myself clear?
BRETT: Very clear. That's one favor I'll be glad to do you.
DENBY: O.K., kid-- I'm only sorry for one thing.
BRETT: What's that?
DENBY: If you hadn't agreed--I was going to throw you overboard--
SHORTIE: Hello, Jimmy. What's up?
BRETT: Listen, Runt--Quick! Where's the ice?
SHORTIE: Why--I--er thought with all this heat turned on I'd hide it.
BRETT: Where did you hide it?
SHORTIE: On the drunk.
BRETT: Get it!
