STEPHEN: Y'know, you got an awful short memory for direct orders. I told you to stay beside me.
BRIAN: -- C'mon, Stephen.
STEPHEN: -- You split the team, man. And what was that crap with the standpipe? You'd think you and a hose were never introduced before.
BRIAN: Goddamn it Stephen!
STEPHEN: -- I told you to stay next to me!
BRIAN: -- I was doin' it! I was up there fucking doin' it. You don't know, man, you don't know what I did!
STEPHEN: What you did was drop the ball, Probie. Get that right.
