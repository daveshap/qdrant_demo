Remote workers: How to give notice over the phone?
I’ve been with my current company for a year and seven months. It’s been a great place to work, a very supportive manager and excellent team. It was my first job after college, and I’m so thankful for all I’ve learned and the way I’ve grown. I had an opportunity to apply for a job that would get me much closer to my long term career goals sort of fall into my lap. I applied, had multiple interviews, even flew out to have a day of interviews with the executive staff. It feels like a perfect fit. 

I received an offer from the company on Friday, and need to give notice with my current employer. It’s not a great week to be doing so, as my manager told me in passing on Friday that she has almost no time on her calendar to talk to people next week. We all work remotely, so it’s not as simple as setting up an in-person meeting to discuss. What’s the best way to give my notice while being respectful of her and showing my appreciation for the opportunity to have worked here? I’m really struggling with guilt over quitting, as our team is chronically understaffed and I know it will be a major workload for others to pick up. Thank you in advance! 

TL;DR How to give notice the most respectful way possible when working remotely and a face-to-face meeting isn’t feasible?
