The environment of a payroll company
Someone I know works for a payroll company providing services for small to med size businesses. He currently has a role as an payroll specialist for implementation. Any time I talk to him about what is going on with work, he is always stressed to the limit. He enjoys the challenge of trying to make various agendas work and has no problem grinding long hours to get it done, but in my opinion, something must be wrong with the company or its just the nature of the business. 

Firstly, the “team” that he is on is more or less a joke. It’s him and 2 others. Any time anyone takes a day off (which happens every week due to family needs) the team is over worked trying not to drown in the amount of work to do. When he takes a day off, he returns to around 200 email, 15 voicemails, 5-10 issues that are on fire, and 3-4 issues that have blown up with his name on it and has to figure out what department didn’t follow protocol. Other departments seem to dump their agendas on them as well to figure out. I have heard so many stories that their team has to figure out a new process to support another team (who has about 15 dedicated employees) because there manager literally doesn’t want to deal with it because they have seniority. This chaos has been going on nonstop for about 8 months and doesn’t look like it will get better considering 4th quarter is the busiest time of the year.

This is just a simple summary of this environment. Is this typical for this type of job or is the company just spread too thin and doesn’t optimize efficient operations?
