BERNSTEIN: Who's a busy man? Me? I'm Chairman of the Board. I got nothing but time ... What do you want to know?
THOMPSON: Well, Mr. Bernstein, you were with Mr. Kane from the very beginning -
BERNSTEIN: From before the beginning, young fellow. And now it's after the end. Anything you want to know about him - about the paper -
THOMPSON: - We thought maybe, if we can find out what he meant by that last word - as he was dying -
BERNSTEIN: That Rosebud? Maybe some girl? There were a lot of them back in the early days, and -
THOMPSON: Not some girl he knew casually and then remembered after fifty years, on his death bed -
BERNSTEIN: You're pretty young, Mr. - Mr. Thompson. A fellow will remember things you wouldn't think he'd remember. You take me. One day, back in 1896, I was crossing over to Jersey on a ferry and as we pulled out, there was another ferry pulling in - - and on it, there was a girl waiting to get off. A white dress she had on - and she was carrying a white pastrol - and I only saw her for one second and she didn't see me at all - but I'll bet a month hasn't gone by since that I haven't thought of that girl. See what I mean? Well, so what are you doing about this Rosebud
THOMPSON: I'm calling on people who knew Mr. Kane. I'm calling on you.
BERNSTEIN: Who else you been to see?
THOMPSON: Well, I went down to Atlantic City -
BERNSTEIN: Susie? I called her myself the day after he died. I thought maybe somebody ought to... She couldn't even come to the 'phone.
THOMPSON: You know why? She was so -
BERNSTEIN: Sure, sure.
THOMPSON: I'm going back there.
BERNSTEIN: Who else did you see?
THOMPSON: Nobody else, but I've been through that stuff of Walter Thatcher's. That journal of his -
BERNSTEIN: Thatcher! That man was the biggest darn fool I ever met -
THOMPSON: He made an awful lot of money.
BERNSTEIN: It's not trick to make an awful lot of money if all you want is to make a lot of money. Thatcher!
