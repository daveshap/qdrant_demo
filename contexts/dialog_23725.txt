ROLLO: Yeah, well, I'm flattered, but you won't find any real meat in them.
ST. LUC: No? How come?
ROLLO: Listen, Rog. I knew Hobbes was funny, you know? I told you that. But I didn't really know just how funny he was. See... when he kicked off, they sent all the personal secret stuff they found to his mother -- she's still alive but just barely -- and she sent everything she thought was medical to me here at the lab. I'm Hobbes's partner, right? Anyway, I've been going through his papers, and what they add up to is this: Hobbes was shafting us all, me, the university, the foundations and the councils, the private labs, everybody. We never really knew what it was we were working on. Hobbes gave us each a few crumbs, but he was the only one who knew what the whole loaf would look like.
ST. LUC: OK, I bite. What does it look like?
ROLLO: It looks like -- and I quote -- 'a disease to save man from his mind.'
ST. LUC: I don't get it.
ROLLO: Lemme clarify for you.
