These fake "I beat cancer" posts are pissing me off because I haven't beat my real cancer
There aren't a lot of then that I've seen but they just make me mad. I got diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma in September and it's been a real shitty time. I can't go to school but still have to do most of the work at home. I rarely get to see my friends. I get so nauseous from my medicine every other week that I literally cant get out of bed for days straight without puking. And technically I don't even have it that bad when it comes to types of cancer so I can't imagine what it's like for people with harsher types than mine.

Maybe I just need to learn to take a joke or something but it really annoys me.

Edit: realized I should be more clear. I'm not mad about people seriously claiming they have cancer because I don't know if they do or not, but the ones that lead with "I beat cancer" and then you click to see that they're saying that because they deleted instagram or something make me mad

Edit again: just to clear things up, my "proof" is [this](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/Aj3UGiD) picture of my Picc line. It's how I get my chemo so I think it's pretty solid proof
