TREVES: The cathedral is coming along nicely.
MERRICK: Yes, soon I will start the main spire, but I must finish these columns first, How kind of her!
TREVES: How blind of me. Is there anything else, John, anything at all that I could get for you?
MERRICK: Oh no! There is nothing! I have everything, you have given me everything I could possibly want. I am happy every hour of the day. I only wish there was something I could give to you.
TREVES: Please John, it would give me so much pleasure to give you something. Something just for yourself. Isn't there something you would like to have?
TREVES: You want a dressing bag, John?
MERRICK: You don't think it's too gaudy, do you?
MOTHERSHEAD: Mr. Treves, some more books arrived for Mr. Merrick.
TREVES: Thank you, Mothershead. Have a porter put them in my office.
MOTHERSHEAD: Yes sir. What's that?
TREVES: A dressing bag.
MOTHERSHEAD: Very smart indeed.
TREVES: Yes. John wants it.
MOTHERSHEAD: A dressing bag?
TREVES: You don't think it's too gaudy, do you.
MOTHERSHEAD: Well...
TREVES: John thinks it's very dashing. Something no gentleman should be without. I'm inclined to agree.
