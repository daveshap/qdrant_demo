Has there been a 'smoking gun' linking Russia with efforts in trying to help Trump win the Presidency?
With the most recent buzz around the [Washington Post story](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/obama-orders-review-of-russian-hacking-during-presidential-campaign/2016/12/09/31d6b300-be2a-11e6-94ac-3d324840106c_story.html) I was wondering if there were any conclusive ties between the Russian government and the hacking of our political parties in the explicit interest in helping Donald Trump win.

By 'Smoking Gun' I mean 'an object or fact that serves as conclusive evidence of a crime or similar act' preferably without a source that is not Anonymous, a vested Private Companies, or Partisan. 

I'm not sure if any source like I describe exists so feel free to compile a neutral comment using the sources above if necessary. 

[This is an incredible timeline of events,](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/52uj5c/do_we_have_any_evidence_that_the_recent_political/d7nrnkm/) but has been since outdated with the election having come and gone.
