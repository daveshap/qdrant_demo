Adding ubuntu server to our Windows AD I have a Windows Server 2016 controlling a domain of 3 PCs which run Windows 10 and share a laser printer.  All seems to be working well.  I have an Ubuntu server with plenty of spare capacity on its HDD.  Can anyone tell me if I can bind this Ubuntu server (17.04) to my Windows domain so that the Windows 10 PC clients can share the Ubuntu Servers's resources (mainly its HDD and print services)?If it is possible, can you advise me on where to find a a good guide to follow to allow me to get this working?  I am new to this level of Ubuntu networking although I have a little experience in basic Ubuntu scripts and use of CLI commands of the Ubuntu Server Many thanks Neal T
