I feel like I'm seting myself up for failure
I just got out of the shower and I kind of broke down and I actually want genuine advice from people. I've tried to talk about this to friends but they all do the kind of push away ignore it. Anyways I just graduated high school and High school was everything to me. And not generally in like I loved it so much, I was a quiet back of the room kid a lot of the time. But I relied on high school cause it's all I had, My only social interaction but also I hated High school, I hated the feeling of doing everything everyday and I got really depressed. I just felt like school was the only thing I had and now I'm just living. I have no job because I haven't been able to get my liscenes. I can't get my liscenses because My mom struggles with migraines a lot and you need someone over 25 to drive with and I don't really have anyone else. So i'm trying to get my licenses and also for the summer I plan on visiting my dad in long beach. I just don't know what to do anymore, I have had such a hard time even getting out of bed, I passed school perfectly fine but if im not doing that I'm just on discord, watching movies, lying in bed. I just need help with how to learn to be happy and how to not feel like i'm failiing at everything. Cause it's so hard to get out of bed just to do nothing with my life. I want to know how to make me not feel like this. It's okay if you read this and don't what to say you mattter and ILY stay safe!
