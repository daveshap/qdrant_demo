MILLER: Everybody okay?
STARCK: We're all here.
MILLER: Okay. Let's find out how much time we just bought.
DJ: We haven't tested the air yet. It could be contaminated...
MILLER: No time. We need whatever's left in our suits to repair the Clark. Like it or not, this is the only oxygen for three billion kilometers.
STARCK: It tastes bad.
MILLER: But you can breathe it.
STARCK: The antennae array's completely fried, we've got no radio, no laser, no highgain... No one's going to be coming to help us.
MILLER: How much oh-two do we have?
STARCK: Oxygen is not the problem.
MILLER: Carbon dioxide?
STARCK: It's building up with every breath we take. And the CO2 filters on the Event Horizon are shot.
MILLER: We can take the filters from the Clark...
STARCK: I thought of that, with the filters from the Clark, we've got enough breathable air for twenty hours. After that, we'd better be on our way home.
MILLER: What about the life readings you picked up?
STARCK: The Event Horizon sensors show the same thing: Bio-readings of indeterminate origin." Right before that wave hit the Clark
MILLER: What's causing the readings?
STARCK: I don't know, but whatever it is, it's not the crew.
MILLER: So where is the rest of the crew? We've been over every inch of this ship and all we've found is blood. Dr. Weir? Any suggestions?
