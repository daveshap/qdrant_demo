5 grand gone in ten minutes.
Yesterday I got the rest of my disability back pay. I paid off my entire renters and car insurance for 6 months, 6 months of my rent and 3 months of my fiancee's rent (we share finances and live together but the way our town does it is each person has their own lease and rent is just split between the leases). That left us enough to pay off the rest of this month's bills, go out to a chinese buffet, and have 300 in savings. I'm proud but it's hard to do the right thing sometimes.  This is the first time I've been this 'paid off' and just wanted to share my small victory.
