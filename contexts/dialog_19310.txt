ANITA: So, you were a geek. Big deal.
JOSIE: Anita, remember espadrilles?
ANITA: Please. That doesn't make you a nerd. Everyone wore those shoes.
JOSIE: The girls threw them at me in the locker room.
ANITA: Okay. That's bad.
JOSIE: At the end of the yeat the person who got the most direct his to my head got to toss me into the pool.
ANITA: Mama mia. Just because you were a nerd once doesn't mean it's going to happen again. That's why you have me for fashion consultation.
ANITA: Now this is cute.
JOSIE: That is lingerie.
ANITA: So I was thinking about what you were saying - y'know, about really being kissed? I think Roger could be the one.
JOSIE: What'd you feel when you kissed him?
ANITA: Bridgework?
JOSIE: Very romantic.
JOSIE: How about this?
ANITA: I am not letting you out of the house in that, young lady.
ANITA: Cuuuute!
JOSIE: 'Nita, this is about reporting, not accessorizing.
ANITA: And we're going to have to do something about your hair.
JOSIE: Anita!
ANITA: Jos, please try and have some fun here, okay? How many of us get to go back to high school? You're gonna have a blast!
