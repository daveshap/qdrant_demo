ROMIREZ: When I was a boy a cart driven by a drunken fool crushed me. All thought I would die or be maimed for life. But I healed quickly. And like you I paid the price for being different.
CONOR: You are the same?
ROMIREZ: Do you ever feel a flow, as if some- thing were pushing against you?
CONOR: Yes. Always.
ROMIREZ: Does it change with me in the room?
CONOR: It is less.
ROMIREZ: You feel you know me.
CONOR: I don't know why.
ROMIREZ: We are brothers.
CONOR: He told me there could be only one.
ROMIREZ: Some cling to sanity through time with the one continuity and trad0 ition their lives have known: The Game. You and I Conor, we are different from all others around us. You know this, you can feel it. We are flesh and bone like any man, but unlike our neighbors we are rather difficult to injure, permanently.
CONOR: I don't understand.
ROMIREZ: You are still so very young.
CONOR: I'm twenty-two.
ROMIREZ: Not even a single lifetime.
ROMIREZ: Conor, you and I, we cannot be killed.
CONOR: What?
ROMIREZ: We are immortal.
