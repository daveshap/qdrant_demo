I don't ever feel wanted.
It seems stupid sometimes, but I don't ever feel like anyone I interact with actually wants to give me attention or make any effort to spend time with me.

I try not to give myself a lot of time to think about it normally, because it seems like a pretty selfish way of approaching relationships, but I can't help but envy what I perceive other people's relationships being like.

I've actually been with someone for about 7 years. We're very close about our inner selves, we live together, share food, share expenses, share income, fuck, and have a good time. But I still have overwhelming feelings that they don't actually want me. Even the way we got together all seems like it was based on my effort and not really their idea or intent, as in, they just went with it because it seemed nice.

I feel like I try to be very open and friendly, but it always seems like the people I try to make friends with are already too invested in other relationships or hobbies to add me into their time. Any time I try to send texts or call people to spend time together, they hardly respond or they say positive things but never actually plan anything. Then my partner does the same and they get responses and get time to hang out with people. I feel like the only friends I have are friends that my partner made and therefore, vicariously, are my friends.

I don't know maybe I'm rambling too much. Does this make sense? Am I crazy? Did I explain enough?
