DEAN: Next time we do a job like this we gonna want more money, or we are going back to post offices and cars.
BARRY: Where're the others?
DEAN: There are no others.
BARRY: Now, stop fucking around. The others, the old ones?
DEAN: I don't know what you mean.
BARRY: There were two old guns there; where are they?
DEAN: Not in the cabinet there wasn't. There was a couple of old hammer-lock muskets the butler was carrying; they were ours, and we sold 'em!
BARRY: Well you just better un-sell 'em, sharpish.
DEAN: They were . . .
BARRY: I am not fucking interested.
TOM: Jesus, if I pick them up, will they stay in one piece? Where did you get them from?
NICK: I got contacts. Listen Tom, if you pointed them at me I'd shit myself or do whatever you said to do. Either way you still get the desired effect.
TOM: They look nice, I agree . . . but lacking in criminal credibility, aren't they? I might get laughed at. How much do you want for these muskets?
NICK: Seven hundred each.
