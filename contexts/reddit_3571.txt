Please for the love of God. Dont waste peoples time like she did mine
I met a girl online. Everything was great. She seemed perfect. We gamed together, she was beautiful, our personalities clicked. We text and called each other everyday and night. Like I'm saying I'd stay up to 2am on the phone with this girl when I gotta be for work at 6am. I was super into her but she lived 10 hours away. Well eventually i was like screw it and asked what she would say if i came and saw her and spent the week with her? She said yes that would be amazing. So I took a week off from work, book a hotel and drove 10 hours in the middle of the night to see her. Got there and soon as I saw her, everything just seemed right. We hugged and kissed and *cough cough* other things *cough* everything just seemed so natural. No shyness, no awkwardness. Just everything just seemed to fall into place. Yea till the little tidbit comes out about her having a fiancee and her being threated by another guy to drop me completely from her life otherwise he would tell her fiancee. So that's what she did. Told me about the fiancee and told me to leave and stay outta her life forever. "I never loved you I only loved the things you did that he couldn't". Kick in the balls eh? I gave so much effort, money and mostly I gave my time, like a lot of fucking time to this girl. Wasted just like that. For nothing. Like dont waste someone's time like that, cause not only did you waste my time while we were together, now you are wasting my time while I try to get over you. I thought she was perfect. She thought I was just something to fuck over. Dont waste peoples time like that.
