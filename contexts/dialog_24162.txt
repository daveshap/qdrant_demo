SUZIE: Looks like the alternator.
CARL: Yeah. It's the alternator all right.
SUZIE: How would you know? You're looking at my tits. Jesus, Carl. Your job is to keep us on the road!
CARL: I didn't do anything --
KEITH: Yeah. That's just the problem.
MAC: Tell me you checked the bus before we left, Carl.
BILLY BOB: Just talked to Orwell down at the garage. Says getting a new alternator for your bus is no problem.
KEITH: Alright!
BILLY BOB: Could take a little while, though.
KEITH: What's a little while?""
BILLY BOB: Two.. maybe three days.
