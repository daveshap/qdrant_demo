FRIDA: He hasn't said one word to me.
JENNIFER: Maybe he's just shy.
FRIDA: My date always pays more attention to you than to me.
JENNIFER: Frida, I don't mean this as a criticism, but you might not want to talk about PMS around men.
FRIDA: Sorry. It's just so bad lately. You're so lucky you never get PMS.
JENNIFER: I get a little bloated sometimes.
FRIDA: I'd kill for just a little bloated.
GEORGE: It all starts with them going to the bathroom together.
CARLTON: That many women in one place -- nothing good can come from that.
GEORGE: Sorry about Frida. She's been friends with Jen forever.
CARLTON: What's with her? If they're not bleeding they're PMSing. If they're not PMSing, they're warning you about the impending doom. If you're lucky, you get a sane person one week a month. Then you gotta date three or four women just to get some normalcy in your life.
GEORGE: I'm lucky Jen's not like that.
CARLTON: I don't believe in PMS. Women made it up just so they can be bitchy.
GEORGE: My brother has an answer to PMS. A-S-S: Abundant Sperm Syndrome. A man gets sperm build-up, and if his woman isn't givin' it to 'em, he's gotta get it elsewhere.
CARLTON: Yeah and when your woman says you're an ass, say yes, I have Abundant Sperm Syndrome.
