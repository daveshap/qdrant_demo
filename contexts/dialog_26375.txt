SIMPSON: 85,000 dollars.
ROSS: Missing????
SIMPSON: Embezzled, Mr. Webster. Stolen from the firm.
VERA: That's what I want to know! By whom? Whom????
ROSS: Get a hold of yourself, Vera. Nobody else ever will.
SIMPSON: I don't know who. Whom. I can't trace it. In the old days it was simple. We kept books, we had ledgers, we could see what was going in and what was paid out. If somebody wanted to rob you, he'd come in with a gun and say 'stick 'em up. Now they get theses blasted computers to do their dirty work!"
ROSS: My friend, you are yesterday. Whoever pulled this caper is tomorrow.
LORELEI: Ross, honey, it's time for your massage...
VERA: Bubba, does this woman have the right to burst in without knocking...!
ROSS: Now, Vera...uh, Simpson, you know my Staff Dietician?
SIMPSON: Hello.
VERA: If you don't mind, we are trying to hold a meeting here!
LORELEI: Why don't you hold your breath, instead? Maybe you'll turn blue. On you that'd be an improvement.
