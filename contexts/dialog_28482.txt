NORA: Pretty girl.
NICK: If you like 'em like that.
NORA: You got types?
NICK: Only you, darling... lanky brunettes with wicked jaws.
NORA: Who is she?
NICK: I was hoping I wouldn't have to tell you. Dorothy is really my daughter. You see, it was Spring in Venice, and I was so young. I didn't know what I was doing. We were all like that on my father's side.
NORA: By the way, how is your father's side?
NICK: Much better, thanks.
NORA: How many drinks have you had?
NICK: Six Martinis.
NORA: Six Martinis. You're not going to have anything on me.
NORA: What hit me?
NICK: That last Martini.
NORA: I can't lie here. I've got to get up and trim that darned Christmas tree.
NICK: Take it easy.
NORA: Who's that?
NICK: Santa Claus.
MACAULAY: How are you?
NICK: Hello, Macaulay. Come in.
MACAULAY: Dorothy told me you were here. I was going to telephone but....
NICK: That's all right. What are you drinking?
MACAULAY: Nothing, thank you. Nothing. I wanted to see you... What's Mimi up to, Charles?
NICK: Mimi? ... Oh, Dorothy's mother. Does she have to be up to something?
MACAULAY: She usually is. Trying one way or another to get money out of Wynant. I wanted to find out if you were er - er - --sleuthing for her.
NICK: I haven't been a detective for four years.
MACAULAY: You don't say --
NICK: My wife's father died and left her a lumber mill and a narrow guage railroad and a couple of other things. And I'm looking after them.
MACAULAY: I see. I see.
NICK: What's all the fuss about? Is he in hiding?
MACAULAY: You know as much about it as I do. I haven't seen him in three months.
NICK: No word at all?
MACAULAY: He sends word through Julia Wolf when he wants money... I give it to her and she gives it to him.
