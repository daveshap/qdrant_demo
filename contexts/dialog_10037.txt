FRANK: What do you mean?
SATCH: Do you know where I found this?
SATCH: 415 Greenwich St. #302. Under the body of a murdered woman.
FRANK: No. This isn't what you think.
SATCH: I wanna be wrong here. But we need to go to the precinct and talk about it.
FRANK: Okay, okay. I need to go say something to Julia and finish up with the guy on the radio.
SATCH: You can talk to Julia. Forget the radio.
