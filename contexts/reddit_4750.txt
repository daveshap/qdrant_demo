My parents are a major source of my desperation/ thoughts of s**f h**m and i have no idea what to doTW: Speaking on s*****e
Hello.  I’d like to start by saying I’m not 100% sure if this is the right subreddit for this and will happily remove if incorrect. So I’m M 23 and ever since I was a kid my parents (mainly father more recently my mother. Well touch on that) have been a large source of my mental health issues. I’ve discussed this with them multiple times and was constantly told “other people have it worse” or when I break down in tears from everyday life being told “ he’s a grown man crying what a cry baby”

2 months ago I attempted to take my life and was put on short term disability until I was approved to longer be at risk to the company I work for and myself. It’s the only time I’ve felt they’ve taken the matter seriously until I found out that my mother has been talking about it to her coworkers and other family members without asking me first. 

So until I manage to find an apartment to move into I’m stuck with in a house where I don’t even feel welcome in anymore, and have begun to distant myself to the point where all I say is “okay” to any sentence and avoid conversations. I do see a therapist and things are going smoothly. I’m just at a lose on how to tell them they’ve been a large cause my problems. Not to have them take fault. But for them to understand they’ve done this and to at least attempt(?) to be “better” in the future 

Thank you
