Looking for first job at 22 during the covid19
Hello all I'm 22 I finished high school and got my hs diploma in 2016.

 I applied to community college finished two semesters and then dropped out and due to mental health reasons and 2018 ever since then Ive basically been at home, from last September to December I moved to Arizona for 5 months and I did volunteer work at a local food bank. 

I have massive volunteer work under my belt because every summer for about five or six years I worked with kids from Pre-K all the way up to eighth grade. 

I applied for Amazon virtual customer service and I got the job just recently after waiting for a little bit more than a month but sadly one of their NDA forms was stuck in my spam folder and I got withdrew due to me not finding that until after the due date. 

I've been looking for virtual work as I know Walmart Target and most of the local stores are still only working at 25% capacity so I was wondering if anybody knows any resources that I could find virtual work in Florida specifically the Tampa Bay Pinellas area.


I've looked online and most of them require extensive previous work or therefore management positions which obviously since I haven't worked I'm not able to get those particular jobs.

The Amazon virtual customer service definitely would help my mom out as it was $15 an hour so I feel extremely bummed about that.
