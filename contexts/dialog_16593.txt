CONWAY: You can't take her away from here!
GEORGE: Why not?
CONWAY: Because you can't. Do you know what will happen to her if she leaves Shangri-La? She's a fragile thing that can only live where fragile things are loved. Take her out of this valley and she'll fade away like an echo.
GEORGE: What do you mean - fade away like an echo"?"
CONWAY: She came here in 1888!
GEORGE: This would be funny - if it wasn't so pathetic. Why, she isn't a day over twenty!
CONWAY: You're wrong, George.
GEORGE: I'm not wrong. She told me so. Besides, she wouldn't have to tell me. I'd know anyway. I found out a lot of things last night. I'm not ashamed of it either. It's probably one of the few decent things that's ever happened in this hellish place.
GEORGE: So everyone is serenely happy in Shangri-La? Nobody would ever think of leaving? It's all just so much rot! She's pleaded with me ever since I came here to take her away from this awful place. She's cried in my arms for hours, for fear I'd leave her behind. And what's more, she's made two trips to the plateau to bribe the porters - for me!
CONWAY: I don't believe it! I don't believe a word of it!
GEORGE: All right. I'll prove it to you! You believe everything they've told you - without proof! I'll prove my story!
