LILI: Oh! Green Jack! What a dream I've had... proper nightmare.
JACK: Whilst you were sleeping, I fetched your ring.
LILI: Sweet Jack. I'm so sorry you found me asleep. Don't know what came over me.
JACK: I can't have been under much more than a minute.
LILI: Seemed like weeks and weeks. Such a terrible dream... I could never tell you...
JACK: Is what you said about the ring but another dream?
LILI: Oh no, dearest Jack... I meant every word.
JACK: You're teasing still.
LILI: Nay, dearest Jack... you are to be my husband. I want none other.
JACK: But... I am a Green Man. I have no title, nor lands... scarce even a few vines and threads to keep the cold from my body.
LILI: You wear your weeds as well as golden armor, Jack. Like a true Prince... a champion!
JACK: Lili... I love you!
LILI: And I love you, my husband.
