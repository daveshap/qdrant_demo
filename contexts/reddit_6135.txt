How do I request work from home from a political company / manager that doesn’t support it?
Long story short, I work at a huge company (multiple offices globally), in the IT department so we already have laptops with VPN. Every single other partner company has closed down their offices and had their employees work remotely. Also, every single department in the building except for ours is now working from home. 

Finally, today our CEO emailed us and told us that we can work from home, as long as we get a thumbs up from our manager. 

My coworker asked her manager if she can work from home, and her manager said no. But the reason was that her manager doesn’t believe in the coronavirus and says that unless she is sick, she still has to come to work.

Basically, only a handful of us (the only people who work under this manager) are still coming to work because of this reason. Everyone else in the entire building is working from home.

I want to ask my manager to work from home tomorrow, but I am also afraid he will say no. 

I’m terribly afraid ill get infected (Im in my 20s but have underlying health conditions and no health insurance). How can I maneuver this political situation and ask to work from home?
