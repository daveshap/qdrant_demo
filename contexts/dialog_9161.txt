SEXY NURSE: You're hot!
JOHNNY: So are you!
SEXY NURSE: I mean, you feel a little feverish.
JOHNNY: I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
SEXY NURSE: My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
JOHNNY: Meet me at 4:01, top of the run. That'll give you a minute to freshen up.
BEN: How long was I out?
REED: Three days. I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
BEN: Solid.
