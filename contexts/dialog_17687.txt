CROCKETT: Hello?
FUJIMA: This is Agent James Fujima.
CROCKETT: Detective Crockett.
FUJIMA: What's your Miami PD badge number?
CROCKETT: 4-4-7 Charlie 12-92.
FUJIMA: Okay. What's up?
CROCKETT: A C.I. we cut loose to your Joint Interagency Task Force. Name of Alonzo Stevens. Now, he's YOUR informant. Stevens, called us. I haven't spoken to him for six months. I do not know what case you have him on. I do not know what he is talking about. But whatever he is doing for you, it sounds like it is going bad. Right now...
FUJIMA: How do I discuss operations over an open line?
CROCKETT: How do I know? I got the call from Alonzo on an open line. That is the hand we have been dealt at this moment, at eleven-forty-seven o'clock Friday night. Okay? I am trying to alert you, here. <u>You</u> know whether or not...you have a thing goin' down. I do not. But we know this guy. I think you know this guy. Normally, he is cool. Tonight he is distraught. That is atypical. That engenders foreboding. Do you understand the meaning of the word foreboding"? As in badness is happening to <u>your</u> deal right fucking now?"
FUJIMA: Guy's involved in a meet"..."
CROCKETT: Buy and walk"? "Buy and bust"? "Reverse undercover"? What?"
FUJIMA: Meet and greet. I flash you some of mine
CROCKETT: And the deal goes down at another place at another time.
FUJIMA: That's right.
CROCKETT: ...so there's <u>no</u> industrial- strength HRT weapons team out there tonight?
FUJIMA: Correct. Flash samples. Flash cash.
TUBBS: Haitian, Dominican, Russian, Israeli?
FUJIMA: White supremacist types.
CROCKETT: OMGs, Mongols, Nazi Low-Riders, prison gangs?
FUJIMA: NLR, we think. I wanna know...
TUBBS: Oh, good...
FUJIMA: ...what else, what else did he indicate to you? I need to know everything he said.
