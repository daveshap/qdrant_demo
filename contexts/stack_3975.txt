Should I adjust for family-wise error when doing many logistic regressions and t tests In my biomarker analysis, there are 100 biomarkers. Each biomarker is measured at 4 different time points. I'm looking for any biomarker that is associated with outcome variable at any timepoints. Here the outcome variable is 'Yes' and 'No'. I'm also trying to find  any biomarker is expressed differentially at any timepoint at the two outcome levels. I'm doing the following analysis:Run 100X4 univariate logistic regressions for all biomarkers for all time pointsRun 100x4 t test for all biomarkers for all time pointsMy question is: In both cases, should I control family-wise error rate? should I adjust p values? I really appreciate it if anyone can clarify me on this.  Thanks a lot in advance.
