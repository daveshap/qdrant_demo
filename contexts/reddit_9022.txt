Should there be a new US constitutional amendment reinforcing the right to privacy?
A right to privacy is not explicitly protected by the bill of rights but has been amalgamated from several amendments (mostly the fourth) and judicial precedence. Would a new explicit privacy amendment that deals with modern technology and mass surveillance be a good idea or are the existing amendments good enough?

I am not American but I think a strong precedent from America in these matters would affect the whole world.
