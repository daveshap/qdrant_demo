How and how quickly should the US and other developed nations adopt renewable energy?
Adoption of renewable energy has accelerated in the West in the last few years. Last year an estimated 25% of new energy generation [came from wind](https://www.utilitydive.com/news/doe-more-than-a-quarter-of-2016-capacity-additions-were-wind/448946/), while solar capacity [nearly doubled](https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/us-solar-market-grows-95-in-2016-smashes-records). Spain currently gets [nearly half](https://cleantechnica.com/2015/04/09/47-spains-electricity-made-renewables-march/) of its electricity from renewables, and a recent French government report [has claimed that](https://cleantechnica.com/2015/04/14/100-renewable-electricity-2050-possible-france/) France could go 100% non-nuclear renewable by 2050 without significant additional expense. Costs for power from wind and and other renewables have even become [cost-competitive with non-renewables](https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/germanys-first-onshore-wind-auction-brings-low-prices-for-citizen-projects) in some European markets.

However, plenty of concerns remain. Across much of the US, renewables are [nowhere near](https://www.forbes.com/sites/uhenergy/2017/04/04/despite-claims-of-grid-parity-wind-and-solar-are-still-more-expensive-than-fossil-fuels/#7787595440e4) cost-competitive with traditional sources of power, especially with a boon in natural gas generation in recent years. Additionally, a [recent trade case](http://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/359443-if-trump-is-looking-out-for-consumers-hell-reject-solar-tariffs) may significantly damage further solar prospects in the US. Meanwhile, major nuclear projects have [stalled](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/31/climate/nuclear-power-project-canceled-in-south-carolina.html) in the US, questioning the future of nuclear as "green" renewable and natural gas prices fall. It has also been pointed out that a transition to renewables would require a [massive overhaul](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/modernizing-us-energy-grid) of the US grid, at significant short term expense. Additionally, a [range of concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_impact_of_wind_power) have been raised about heretofore unforeseen negative environmental effects of various renewables. Finally, there remain concerns about economic transition away from coal and oil to other energy sectors.
