im jealous of developed countries
sorry for any bad grammar, i didnt feel like fixing any mistakes

im jealous of people living in developed countries, i really am.

i was born in a joke of a country in africa, its just like the usual, crap healthcare, shitty education, corrupt government, locked in neverending wars, blah blah, and im not really sure what i can do about it,

they had somesort of revolution recently but itll probably take years before any real changes happen

everybody is living like shit but theyre all so hopeful about the revolution for some reason, im not really sure why

its amazing thery all so hopeful even though everbody lives like crap, im really jealous, i wish i could feel the same way

and my family has been really helpful so far, giving me a bed to sleep in, food to eat and such even though everything is so expensive for them , i dont feel that im grateful enough, and theres alsso people living worse than me so i dont have any right to feel sad

the country is sudan if that helps

im attending a really crappy uni for medical school that i really dont care about, it doesnt have a professional looking website even

and the lecture halls are really small, it doesnt look anything like i saw in moviees and such

apparently if you can get a medical degree or an engineering one, you can work outside if you get really good grades, even in super advanced countres like australia or canada, but you have to pass some sort of really diffcult exam before you can get accepted and that worries me, because i dont think i can get motivated enough anyway to study for it

im really jealous of westerners, they have everything they could ever want

they have cool things like museums and space obsevatories and such, ive always wanted to go to one of these, or maybe a movie theater, ive never been in one before, while here we have nothing

im sorry for rambling and my really crappy grammar, i just wrote whatever was on my mind and i dont really care about revising

thanks, just writing this down after bottling it up for so long feels really liberating, i feel so much better already, and usually im not in this much of a bad mood, ill probably get over it in the morning

Edit :

Sorry about the delay, I was a bit embarrassed to check this account after rambling for so long, and I was afraid I wouldn't get any replies...

Thank you so much for replying, everyone! I really can't find the words to express how I feel.

All that I can say is thank you, and I hope you get through all your problems as well.

Finding some sort of medium to talk about my problems, especially in a country that doesn't take mental health seriously at all, it honestly feels amazing.

It's just like some of you have said, people in developed countries can definitely suffer too. It's always a good idea to put yourself in other people shoes and see what they're going through. Even if they're much better off than I am, they can still be depressed, and that's okay.

There are also people far worse than I am, even in developed countries, and that's also okay.

Thank you for reminding me about perspective, and once again, thank you for replying. It really means a lot to me.
