Undiagnosed ADHD made me poor for a very long time. Were you called, “smart but lazy” in school and feel like you’ve never met your potential? This might be your case, too.
This is in response to the many criticisms of this sub becoming a circle jerk with no practical advice to get people out of poverty. 

Disclaimer: I’m still not financially stable enough to find r/PersonalFinance helpful. I still have a mountain of student loan debt that doesn’t seem to be doing anywhere. And I still don’t make much above the average American income. But, I’m no longer impoverished. I no longer have to chose between food and gas. I own a house and have a new-ish (10 years old instead of 20 years old) reliable car. 

Getting diagnosed with ADHD in 2017 when I was 27 was the real turning point for me. My entire adult life, I could see the top of the mountain, but not the paths to get there. Medication, cognitive behavior therapy and lifestyle modifications helped me clear away the clouds and see the necessary steps to get me where I am now. Everyone’s case is so different and I can neither diagnose nor give you a ton of career advice, but if you’d like to know more about my personal experience I’m happy to elaborate.

EDIT: I had a hunch that there might be folks out there who would benefit from this conversation. I think there's a lot of ADHD folks represented on reddit compared to the general public. Maybe the format appeals to our brains? A lot of us aren't diagnosed though. Despite what the media says about ADHD, experts believe it is actually grossly underdiagnosed, especially demographics outside of young, white boys. So I had a thought if reddit appeals to ADHDrs and most of us aren't diagnosed, those that aren't diagnosed are probably struggling financially. I thought a little anecdotal PSA here couldn't hurt. Good luck to those of you out there pursuing this.
