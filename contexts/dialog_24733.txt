DAVID LEE: I cut it on some glass and we got lost, Mama.
REBECCA: Did you find your father?
DAVID LEE: Didn't see 'im, Mama. The other men there say they didn't know Daddy.
REBECCA: I guess they musta sent 'im to another camp.
REBECCA: What's that you carryin'?
DAVID LEE: Some books Miss Johnson gave me.
REBECCA: Who's Miss Johnson?
DAVID LEE: Miss Johnson is a teacher, and...
DAVID LEE: So when I left, she gave me these books.
REBECCA: Miss Johnson must be a real kindly lady.
DAVID LEE: She is, Mama... When the fall comes, she wants me to come to her school.
REBECCA: How can you do that? You don't live anywhere near that school.
DAVID LEE: She says I can come live with her while school goin' on, and come back home every time there ain't no school.
REBECCA: But who's gonna help me here with the house and in the field?
