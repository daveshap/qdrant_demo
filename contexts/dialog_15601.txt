DALLY: What would you like us to do?
ADELLE: Put out a P.B.S.... Or whatever it's called.
DALLY: A.P.B.... He isn't breaking any law. He's a grown man... He can crawl on his hands and knees to China if that's what he wants to do.
ADELLE: Sergeant, I'm a psychologist and I know the difference between normal whims people have and actions that clearly display psychological problems... My uncle lost his wife and it devastated him.
DALLY: We're very sorry about that. Some of our men were on the scene of the accident.
ADELLE: I think my uncle is suffering from a condition called Mania which is linked with depression. It is a time when an individual will act over-confident, and will act out impractical, grandiose plans. Sometimes these plans can be dangerous.
DALLY: How long does this... Mania last?
ADELLE: A couple days to a few months if untreated.
DALLY: Look, I'll see if anyone has spotted him recently. If I get any information, I'll call you.
ADELLE: Thank you.
DALLY: Don't wait by the phone. If he's really been walking this whole time, he's out of our jurisdiction...
