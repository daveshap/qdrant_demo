SWANA: He won another blue ribbon and bit the judge. Ha! ha! ha! I bought him the cutest sweater as a reward. You should see him strut down the street in it. He looks like a little boulevardier. You see, Count d'Algout gave me Punchy for my birthday. You must have searched weeks before you found anything as divine as Punchy, didn't you, Leon?
LEON: Months, Swana.
SWANA: Poor Madame Yakushova... here we are talking in mysteries.... I'm sure you wonder what it's all about.
NINOTCHKA: Not at all.... I understand perfectly, Count d'Algout gave you a dog. You made it very clear, madame.
SWANA: Dear me... I must be losing my finesse. If I'm not careful I'll be understood by everybody.
LEON: There's a charming crowd here tonight, isn't there?
SWANA: I'm going, Leon... but before I leave I must compliment you on your gown, Madame Yakushova. Is that what they're wearing in Moscow this year?
