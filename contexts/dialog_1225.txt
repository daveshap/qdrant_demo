JACK: Nice to see you.
DAVID: Get the fuck out of here, Jack.
JACK: Thanks a lot.
DAVID: This is too much. I can't handle this.
JACK: I'm aware that I don't look so great, but I thought you'd be glad to see me.
JACK: David! You're hurting my feelings.
DAVID: Hurting your feelings? Has it occurred to you that it may be unsettling to have you rise from your grave to visit me? Listen to me, I'm talking to a hamburger!
JACK: I'm sorry to be upsetting you, David, but I had to come.
DAVID: Aren't you supposed to be buried in New York someplace?
JACK: Yeah. Your parents came to my funeral. I was surprised at how many people came.
DAVID: Why should you be surprised? You were a very well-liked person.
JACK: Debbie Klein cried a lot.
DAVID: I can't stand it.
JACK: So you know what she does? She's so grief stricken she runs to find solace in Rudy Levine's bed.
DAVID: Rudy Levine the shmuck?
JACK: Life mocks me even in death.
DAVID: I'm going completely crazy.
JACK: David!
DAVID: What?!
JACK: David, now I know this may be hard for you, but I have to warn you.
DAVID: Warn me? Will you get out of here, you meat loaf?
JACK: I'm a grisly sight, it's true; but I love you and that's why I'm here. You've got to know.
DAVID: If you love me so much, Jack, you'll realize how disconcerting it is to share one's breakfast with the living dead!
JACK: We were attacked by a werewolf.
DAVID: I'm not listening!
JACK: On the moors, we were attacked by a lycanthrope, a werewolf.
DAVID: Shut up, you zombie!
JACK: I was murdered, an unnatural death, and now I walk the earth in limbo until the werewolf's curse is lifted.
DAVID: What's wrong with you? Shut up!
JACK: The wolf's bloodline must be severed. The last remaining werewolf must be destroyed.
DAVID: Will you be quiet?!
JACK: It's you, David.
DAVID: What?!
JACK: You survived and now you shall continue the curse.
DAVID: What are you talking about? I won't accept this! Get out! God damit!
JACK: Remember what that guy at The Slaughtered Lamb said? 'Beware the moon.'
DAVID: Stop it, Jack.
JACK: Beware the moon. The full moon, David. You've got two days.
DAVID: Jack, please go away. Please go away.
JACK: You'll stalk the streets of London a creature of the night.
DAVID: You're talking like Boris Karloff! It's movie dialogue!
JACK: David, please believe me. You will kill people, David. You've got to stop the bloodshed before it begins.
DAVID: Nurse!
JACK: Listen to me! Take your own life, David. It's our only chance.
DAVID: Nurse!
JACK: The supernatural! The powers of darkness! It's all true. Take your own life! Suicide, David. Join me.
DAVID: Nurse! Oh God! Alex!
JACK: It's cold, David, and I'm so alone. The undead surround me. Have you ever talked to a corpse? It's boring! I'm lonely! Kill yourself, David, before you kill others.
