LAMAR: If everything goes to plan, this could be the last time I see you for a while. One week to go. Please tell me you're the least bit excited.
JEROME: I'll tell you at the end of the week.
NURSE: What are you doing?
MARIA: I can't do this.
NURSE: I told you, the government pays. It's all taken care of.
MARIA: No, you don't understand. I <i>can't</i>.
NURSE: The doctor will give you something.
MARIA: I'm not doing it.
NURSE: Honey, you've made <i>one</i> mistake--
NURSE: --I've read your profile. I don't know about the father but you carry enough hereditary factors on your own. You can have other children.
MARIA: Not like <i>this</i> one.
NURSE: Honey, look around you. The world doesn't want one like <i>that</i> one.
