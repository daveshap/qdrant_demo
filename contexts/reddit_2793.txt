Poor choices and laziness has led me to severe job dissatisfaction and fear of the future - where do I go from here?
I'm nearly 27, I live in the UK,  and definitely think I'm experiencing a quarter life crisis. Here is my story:

&#x200B;

I always enjoyed being creative, and while I never planned to go I made a last minute decision to go to university to study BA Games Art, and graduated with a 2:2. I consider it to be an essentially useless qualification that isn't particularly useful, and something that I was never good enough at to seriously pursue anyway.

&#x200B;

After university I fell into a customer service call centre environment, then after nearly 3 years I joined a software company working in sales. I wasn't terrible at it, but the constant stress and pressure made me dread it everyday. Still, I stuck it out for nearly 3 years and found myself in a position where I could take a year off and travel, with the idea I'd do some soul searching and "find myself".

&#x200B;

Now I'm back, I've joined another smaller software company as an account manager, although there is no sales element here. As I sit here writing this, I'm kinda terrified that I still don't know what I'm doing. I can't really see much room for progression in this career path, except into more sales type roles, which I know I don't want to do. As I get older money is becoming more important to me as I find I can barely afford to rent let alone think about getting any assets of my own.

&#x200B;

I find myself looking at posts online about retraining, going back to university, starting again a whole new career - but I don't have the first idea about how to do that.

Has anyone here experienced anything like this and could provide some advice on how to get out of this rut?
