Install Ubuntu 18.04 LTS on small SSD and HDD I read some topics concerning the subject but mostly people have bigger SSD than mine. I have samsung 530U with built-in 14,9GB SSD. I would like to use it somehow but last time I installed Ubuntu on that SSD it ended with lack of space for updates and so on very quickly.How should I mount Ubuntu so I could take advantage of this SSD and not get into trouble in couple of months with inceasing size of operating system. I must add I use hibernation very often. Is it possible?Thank you for all suggestions. Edit: My computer has 8GB RAM, Intel\u00ae Core\u2122 i5-2467M CPU @ 1.60GHz \u00d7 4 , Intel\u00ae Sandybridge Mobile GPU, 64 bit, 14.9 GB SSD, 500GB HDDEdit2: I do clean-up very often with BleachBit with root permissions. Nevertheless system is getting bigger with time even I do that so it is not a solution.
