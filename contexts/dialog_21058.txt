STEW: Well, well, well! Gallagher, old pal! There you are. What did you run away for?
GALLAGHER: I didn't run away.
STEW: Sure, you ran away. Aren't you going to congratulate a guy?
GALLAGHER: Sure. I wish you all the luck in the world, pal.
STEW: Thanks, thanks.
GALLAGHER: I hope you'll be very happy.
STEW: Oh sure, we'll be happy. What's the matter with your eyes?
GALLAGHER: It's the smoke.
STEW: Joe! A little snifter. Say, wasn't I a lucky guy to fall into a girl like that, huh? Look at that! I don't know how I rate that, Gallagher. Gosh, there's a swell girl. I want you to meet her.
GALLAGHER: Who me? She wouldn't want to meet me. I'm just an old load of hay.
STEW: Ah! Thank you, Joe. Tell you what - we'll have one of those parties down at your house - one of those spaghetti parties, you know. Gee, we haven't had one of those in a long time, have we Gallagher?
GALLAGHER: Not since you broke into society.
STEW: Remember the time we had a spaghetti party, and while I was serving the spaghetti I dropped it on the floor, and while those mugs weren't looking, I picked it up and served it to them anyway! Remember that? Yes, Anne would love that.
GALLAGHER: Do you think your wife would walk up three flights of stairs just to eat out of paper plates?
STEW: Who - Anne? Sure, Anne would love that.
GALLAGHER: Remember, she's a Schuyler.
STEW: Now get this, Gallagher - Smith. That's the name.
GALLAGHER: My error.
STEW: Well, if she doesn't want to come, I'll come down alone.
GALLAGHER: Oh no, you won't, Mr. Smith. You're a married man now. Mother always warned me never to run around with married men.
STEW: Say, what kind of a pal are you? You're not going to leave me flat?
GALLAGHER: Oh, I'll call you up some time. And if your social duties permit - why -
STEW: Cut that out. Just because I'm married - there's no reason for that.
