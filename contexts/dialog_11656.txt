MARCELLA: This is not good.
MARTIN: I'll do it tomorrow.
MARCELLA: What's it look like?
MARTIN: It's fine.
MARCELLA: You haven't looked at the dossier.
MARTIN: I've looked at it.
MARCELLA: You have.
MARTIN: Yes. It's the same as usual. Nothing remarkable about it at all.
MARCELLA: I have to call the client and give them a reason why you're late.
MARTIN: Tell them my house exploded.
MARCELLA: I'll call them and tell them you're taking your time. Being a professional.
MARTIN: Okay, call them. Fine. Oh-- And if you could find out why they double- booked the job, and who is trying to kill me, and call me back-- that's be great.
MARCELLA: Will do.
DEBI: Are you there?
MARTIN: Yes.
DEBI: Pick me up at my father's house at around seven. And don't be late this time.
DEBI: Hello...?
MARTIN: This night, this reunion will be an important step in our relationship.
DEBI: You're fucking psycho.
MARTIN: Don't rush to judgement until all the facts are in.
MCCULLERS: I wish he'd do his job already so we could do our job.
LARDNER: We can't do our job unless he does his job.
MCCULLERS: Why don't we just do his job then, so we can do our job, and get the fuck out of here.
LARDNER: Do his job? I'm not a cold-blooded killer.
MCCULLERS: Wait a minute--
LARDNER: -Look. You want to kill a Good Guy, but not be a Bad Guy, you wait until a Bad Guy kills the Good Guy, and then you come in and kill the Bad Guy, and then you're the Good Guy.
MCCULLERS: So if we do his job, we're the bad guys. If we do our job, we're the good guys.
LARDNER: Yup.
