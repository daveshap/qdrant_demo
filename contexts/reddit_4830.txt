I need help
I don’t know what to do anymore, I just want to die. I’m in the darkest parts of depression and i have no support system. 
My boyfriend doesn’t understand, he just asks “why can’t you just choose to be happy?” And I have no answer for him. I wish I could “just be happy”  I need him to love me and give me the support, just to feel wanted and loved... but instead I get called names like a Goblin!  he’s just so cold. My eyes are puffy from constantly crying..
My mother says I should move in with her, but that relationship can be even more toxic. 
I also suffer from anxiety and BPD. So not only am I terrified to leave the house, I have an extremely fear of FOMO. which leaves me feeling, I don’t even know.... and I’m stuck in a city I hate. I wanna move back home so badly to Seattle... but I’m stuck in Ohio for another year. And I truly don’t think I’ll survive it. Please help me.
