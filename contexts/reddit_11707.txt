Just a bunch of unwanted feelings and the need to vent.
So I don't want to bother anyone, but I just need to at least let this out, and I can't think of anywhere else to go. So here it goes. I am a horrible person. About a year ago, my best friend broke up with her boyfriend, who of course also happens to be my friend. He took it really badly, so you know I was there for him. So we started talking more and more and of course grew much closer. And that's where the shit begins. He always was kinda my type of guy, but you know, my friend made a move so I backed up. Not that anyone ever knew. But now I think I'm falling for him. And that's really really bad. Even if I know my friend would be completely okay with it I couldn't even bring myself to make a move on him. And now some of our mutual friends are starting to say stuff along the lines of "Oh you would make such a cute couple with Dude. I still on't understand why he went for her and not you." Cause you know, it's obviously what I want to hear. And to make everything worst, even if the fact that he's my best friend's ex didn't bother me I couldn't even make a move on him anyways. Cause of course, I fall in the asexual spectrum of things, but the part where I absolutely love kissing and cuddling, but not anything more. So I can't even think about being in a relationship with someone even if I want to. And it's just so annoying, because not one of my friend knows, and all of my friends know the two ex lovebirds so I can't talk about it to anyone without being judged.
