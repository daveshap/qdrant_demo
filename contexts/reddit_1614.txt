Can we all agree this all sucks ??
Yes, it sucks that seniors are getting their grad nights, admission days, proms, possible graduation, last senior performances, games, events cancelled. Sucks major ass.

Yes, it sucks that juniors are getting their SATS and competitions and AP tests cancelled or interferes with. 

Yes, if sucks for the underclassmen who are gonna be missing out on valuable time to volunteer or participate in activities. 

Yes, it sucks for college students who are possibly having their own senior events cancelled maybe even graduation. 

Yes, it sucks for the adults who won’t be able to work and will get behind on payments.

Yes, it sucks for the people who actually have the disease and their health is in jeapordy. 

So can we stop saying “okay but MY junior year is messed up so stop complaining” or “we’ll my senior events are cancelled so I have it worse”. It all sucks. And if you want to vent about how much it sucks, go for it! This is an open space! But don’t make this into a competition about who has it worse. This all sucks and sometimes we just need to vent. 

Life will go on and this pandemic will pass and we’ll be okay. Let’s not make this ugly guys. We’re better than that.
