NADIA: You are very good in the world history class, yes?
JIM: Me?
JIM: Yes. No. Yes.
NADIA: Perhaps you can help me with my studies?
JIM: Okay...that would be cool sometime. How 'bout tomorrow?
NADIA: Well, I do have ballet practice. Perhaps I can come by your house afterwards. I can change clothes at your place?
JIM: I suppose that would be okay.
OZ: Nice car.
HEATHER: I'm glad you think so.
OZ: You don't like it?
HEATHER: No, I like the car. By the way, though, about prom? That was like a bad idea. Sorry I invited you.
OZ: What?!
HEATHER: Oh, please. I asked you because I thought you might actually be worth going with. But you are just a jock. No wait. You're a jerk.
OZ: What? No I'm not.
HEATHER: I saw you making fun of me with your lacrosse buddies.
OZ: I wasn't making fun of you.
HEATHER: Give me a break, you're so full of it.
