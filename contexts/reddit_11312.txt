Hearing voices/social anxiety
I'm 17 I smoked a lot of weed while going through some traumatic events. I was unhappy before that and since those events I've been hearing voices. It's always the people around me. I'll hear my mother or my sister or people I walk by down the street. It's almost never logical and I try to tell myself that but it keeps happening. I dont know if it's schizophrenia or not. 
Sometimes I think I'm just misidentifying real noises for people and other times it's clear words. When I was still smoking, it was amplified and I thought if I stopped then the voices would stop but they haven't. I havent smoked for 2 weeks and it still happens. I wonder if its schizophrenia or just extreme paranoia I can't tell. It's not happening currently. It happens during or after social confrontations. I've had to turn and look to make sure people's mouths aren't moving because I'm hearing them. I've created insane stories in my head. White noise only worsens it. I also hear ringing in my ears, it doesn't bother me usually. Lately white noise has made the voices it really bad actually. I wish I could run away and live on my own then there would be no reason to hear anybody or get paranoid. But I know that wouldn't help in the long run. I need to get around people more but this problem makes me want to run instead. I wish I had a reset button for my brain.
