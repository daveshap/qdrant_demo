When executives leave
Hi, I am relatively junior in my field (software). Around 4 months ago, CFO of the company (50 people) left. Two days ago, CEO resigned. We have an interim CEO.

I personally was not given an explanation but have a bad feeling about it. I don't see how CEO can just resign without explanation from a cushy position, really hard to get. I use logic and deduce that it must be financial reasons because quitting like that is surely not for personal reasons.

I am bothered by CFO leaving a few months ago.

Am I just paranoid or my logic is correct?
