BOBO: Not skimming a thing, Lilly?
LILLY: Oh, well, you know. I just clip a buck here and a buck there. Not enough to notice.
BOBO: That's right. Take a little, leave a little.
LILLY: A person that don't look out for himself is too dumb to look out for anybody else. He's a liability, right, Bobo?
BOBO: You're a thousand percent right!
LILLY: Or else he's working an angle. If he doesn't steal a little, he's steeling big.
BOBO: You know it, Lilly.
LILLY: You know, I like that suit, Bobo. I don't know what there is about it, but it somehow makes you look taller.
BOBO: Yeah? You really think so? A lot of people been telling me the same thing.
LILLY: Well, you can tell them I said they're right. I better get going. Roy'll wonder where I am.
BOBO: Worries about his mother, eh? Give him a hug for me.
LILLY: I will. So long, Bobo.
