Looking for jobs abroad. Advice needed!
Hi everyone! I am finishing up my third year in Student Life currently and starting to think about a new job. Have any of you had experience getting a job outside of your own country in higher ed? I live in Texas right now and would live to work in a different country for a while. Any advice would help!!!
