Fell in love, lost my chance
Well i don´t really have someone to talk about this so here it goes. Haven´t been with someone for a long time just because im shy when we talk about love and stuff. But there was a girl i meet and we talked a lot and all that stuff, something started. As i was scared to take a step when the perfect situation happened,  i think she ended up losing interest in the relation and all went cold. Now we dont talk as before and i feel sad about it. I´m just sad because i think that all the effort will end up in nothing and i´ll be alone again just because i didn´t take the step when i should.

Probably not as important as other people bigger problems but i just wanted to write this somewhere
