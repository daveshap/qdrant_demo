VITELLI: If you're not out of there soon, I have got to seal the...
VITELLI: ...tunnel!
MASON: God! They're gonna seal it.
ARLO: Well, why don't they talk to the sage of Jerome here?!

MASON: ...there's a colonel...
MASON: ...on the other end of this phone.
MASON: His name's Vitelli. Talk to him. He's right out-...
MASON: ...side!
PAPPAS: What happened to Colonel Brynner?
MASON: 
ARLO: Listen, deputy.
