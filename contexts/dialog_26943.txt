NICHOLAS: Pardon me... Miss... ?
CHRISTINE: Oh, no... you.
NICHOLAS: I'm not sure how this works. Do you have something for me... ? I got this note...
CHRISTINE: What are you babbling about, psycho?
NICHOLAS: I want to know what's going on. Are you part of this?
CHRISTINE: What's going on? I'm going on my second job this month, and now I'm going on unemployment.
NICHOLAS: Excuse me, I need to explain...
CHRISTINE: Don't explain. Fuck off. Goodbye.
