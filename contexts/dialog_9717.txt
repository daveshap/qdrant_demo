CATHERINE: Hello...
BOBBY: I guess you fell in the water.
CATHERINE: Yes, intentionally.
BOBBY: That's dangerous, you know.
CATHERINE: Swimming?
BOBBY: Playing piano all day and then jumping into cold water. You could get a cramp.
CATHERINE: I love to swim, and I don't mind the cold at all. It's invigorating.
BOBBY: Well, I wouldn't want to get too invigorated myself.
CATHERINE: Why?
BOBBY: What would I do with it? Run amok?
BOBBY: Besides piano and swimming, what else do you do?
CATHERINE: Well, there's fishing and boating. There's concerts on the mainland and... but I feel silly telling you. This is really your home. You probably know better than I what there is to do.
BOBBY: Nothing.
CATHERINE: Nothing? Then it must be very boring for you here.
BOBBY: That's right. Have you anything to suggest?
CATHERINE: I don't know. Let me give it some thought.
