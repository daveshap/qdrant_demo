Probably the most exhausting part about anxiety is that the simple tasks are twice as difficult to do when compared to what I imagine non-anxious people deal with.
Gotta get ready for the day? What is the step by step breakdown of every task I need to do before I’m presentable...

Gotta make breakfast? What is the order in which I need to make this smoothie...

Got a list of things due at work? What’s most important, did I order that correctly, alright I’m done...is my work good enough...

Ok I’m gunna send a text to this person. Did I say the perfect thing in that exact moment...

It’s so tiring.
