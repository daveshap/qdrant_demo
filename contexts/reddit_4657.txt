Does anyone else feel to shit to "be human" ?
I was walking with a friend and i was feeling terrible and she was talking abiut things a "human" would smile, laugh, or at least give any kind of facial and or vocal expression, and usually i at least pretend to smile etc.
but today i felt way to bad and i usually responded with "mhm" ,"uhuh", (those without even opening my mouth cuz thats top much work apparently) or the bare and absolute minimum of words to express that im still listening.  
And she asked "you good?" and obviously because i was feeling so very not good and desperatly want help i answered "yea, yea".
