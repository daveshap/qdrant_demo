I’m finally leaving this sub, best of luck to all of you, wish I could hug every single one of you.
After years of battling anxiety and panic attacks, I am finally proud to say I live a life without excessive anxiety, panic and worry. I started Lexapro and it’s changed my life. I feel as if a weight I didn’t know was there has been lifted off my shoulders. I can finally fucking breathe. People who are in these forums are people who need help, which there is nothing wrong with that. Although, I don’t need help anymore! Tons of people have helped me in this sub and given me great comforting advice. Best of luck to all of you and I hope one day soon you too can leave this sub!!! PM if you need help or have any questions. Much love.

EDIT: You guys make it hard to leave. All of you are so supportive. Anxiety is such a bitch and I seriously PRAY one day you all can live anxiety free!!! Please PM for anything ❤️
