LILLIAN: Oh, just leave those things for now.
FRANCES: No, Mama, I'll take care of it. I'll wash them in the morning.
LILLIAN: You know, little sister, I never resented you for refusing to see me in the... the hospital. I knew you had to manage on your own before you could come back.
FRANCES: Thank you for understanding, Mama.
LILLIAN: Little sister, I don't want you to feel any rush to get back to work. I want you to rest... for a while anyway.
FRANCES: I will, I promise.
