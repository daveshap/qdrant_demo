Anyone else interested in everything?
Hey everyone!

Ever since I can remember I've been a super curious, knowledge-seeking person which I think helped me alot in certain aspects of my life but it makes deciding which courses to take in college and what my career path will look like a nightmare...

For some background, I just turned 20 (today's my birthday!) and I'm currently in my second year of a bachelor's in Computer Science. I chose Computer Science mainly because it would allow me to get a job pretty much anywhere in the world but I don't particularly LOVE it. I'm quite interested in Psychology, Neuroscience, History,  Philosophy but also some Politics and some aspects of engineering. I'm not super extroverted but I'm also not an introvert, I like to be around people and sometimes even talk in public to a lot of people but other times I just wanna be alone for a whole weekend.

I feel like people can rely on me and I would do well on a managerial position but I'm unsure since I don't have any job experience.  I love learning about diferent cultures and how they go about their day, including traditions, ideas, how they view the world etc, so having a job that somehow included that would be amazing (although maybe hard to obtain).

Anyone that has gone through a similar situation? I have never really asked for help before because I always ended up deciding and living with the consequences but this time I want to get it right (or as close as possible anyway).

Thank you so much!!
