MILLER: Where?
JACKSON: In the shadow by those two trees.
MILLER: My guess, too.
UPHAM: What is it?
MILLER: A machine gun.
REIBEN: Sir, I've got an idea, let's go around.
MILLER: We can't leave it here.
JACKSON: We left them eighty-eights.
MILLER: They don't send planes to put out machine guns. Two flank runners with surpressing fire. I'm going right, whoever goes left has to be fast.
UPHAM: Sir, I ran the 220 in high school.
REIBEN: He's fast, Captain, I saw him.
WADE: How fast?
UPHAM: Twenty-four-five.
WADE: Shit, that's nothing, I ran twenty- two flat.
