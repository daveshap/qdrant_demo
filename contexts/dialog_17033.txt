DOYLE: Anyhow...	you wake up and she's gone. But-- --this is my favorite part-- she leaves you the keys to a brand new Beemer.
JIM: She stole my car!!
MARVOSA: Bullshit...
DOYLE: Did you report it stolen?
DOYLE: So... to get the car back, you break into her house.
JIM: I didn't break in - the back door was open!
DOYLE: Yeah, it was opened - with a goddamn screwdriver!!!
