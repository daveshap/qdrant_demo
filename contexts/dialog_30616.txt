GEKKO: See this? Can you believe it? Two inch screen...
BUD: ...I can't even see it...
GEKKO: ...for my kid Rudy -- 3 years old, electronics freak, got a liquid crystal display 'stead of an electronic beam. We're going into a new age pal. So how's business today.
BUD: Bluestar was at 21 and an eighth when I left the office. It might spin up to 25 by the bell...
GEKKO: Teldar's shooting up. Buy any for yourself? Bet you were on the phone two minutes after you got out of my office.
BUD: No sir, that would've been illegal...
GEKKO: Sure...relax sport, no one's gonna blow a whistle. Here, is this legal?...you wanna put it in my account?
