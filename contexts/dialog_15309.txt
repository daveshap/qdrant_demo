SPANGLER: -- Usual case history -- this isn't a medical confidence, it's all of them -- broken family, lonely, confused, crummy childhood, early promiscuity, formal prostitution beginning in her teens, income twenty-five to thirty thousand a year. Oh they don't keep the money: they get rid of it, they get pimps. Why? Why do you want to know all this?
KLUTE: I want to know how Tom Grunemann got mixed up in it.
SPANGLER: Not unusual.
KLUTE: Did she talk about him to you?
SPANGLER: About his letters -- that's all she remembered. Quite violent material, I'd say, obsessive, a quite sick man. But that's not unusual either.
KLUTE: Has she talked with you since prison?
SPANGLER: No. She had every good intention of it -- coming to me as a private patient, getting out of the life, devoting herself to an acting career.
KLUTE: I think she's trying that.
SPANGLER: Oh sure they try. The idea of a better life. But they don't really know much about life: They get confused -- or scared or frustrated or bored -- they pop back to the one thing they can handle. The trick. The trick. Men in bed. Not men in general, not life, not love, not even real sex -- it avoids all that. Just the trick, the transaction.
