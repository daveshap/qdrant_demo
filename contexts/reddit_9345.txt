I get the poor now
I am very lucky.

I will never have housing problems because I live with my family ( mom, grandparents, aunt and uncle)
or hospital bill because I live in Italy. 

I thought nobody could get poor because I couldn't

But my shoulders are covered by a sound family without debt.
Now I am in a small financial struggle and I owe my mother € 1k 

My payment will come at the 28th of this month  and it will be €650

What will I do without my family? What about who doesn't have a family? 

From my privileged prospective I couldn't get the prospective of poverty but getting in debt really opened my eyes. 

I really appreciate all your struggles and keep it up with your effort to get a better life

Edit: some comment made me realize that the title is wrong.  I Cannot say that I get all poor people and their strugle just because I am 1k in debt with my mum. 

Since I cannot edit the title pretend that it was:
 
"Now I get how someone can get poor "
