MRS. FEUR: Love.
CLAIRE: What?
MRS. FEUR: Have you ever felt so completely consumed by a feeling for someone that you couldn't breathe? That the time together is so passionate and consuming that you felt physical pain when they would leave?
CLAIRE: Um...sure.
MRS. FEUR: I couldn't catch my breath. That's not a metaphor, that's...And I panicked. I never dreamed anyone would hear me back there... I tried to leave him. Went to my mother's in Boston. He brought my things up and pleaded with me to come home.
MRS. FEUR: You must think I'm pathetic.
CLAIRE: No. No, I don't.
MRS. FEUR: I'm sorry that I frightened you like that. But I was so touched by your concern. I've been lonely here. Perhaps we could be friends.
