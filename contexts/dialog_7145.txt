DAVE: He said he'll pick it up in a couple of days.
ELLEN: Oh... Okay.
DAVE: What?
ELLEN: It's just so strange...
ELLEN: I lock at you and I see Bill... I mean, he's almost dead, but he's right here... I mean, you're right here... alive and...
DAVE: I'm not Bill Mitchell.
DAVE: In fact, I'm not anything like him and... I guess I want you to know that.
ELLEN: He wasn't always like that, anyway.
DAVE: Are you hungry?
ELLEN: What?
DAVE: I'm starving. There's got to be something open around here.
ELLEN: I really don't have much of an appetite.
DAVE: Just wait.
