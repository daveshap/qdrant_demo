The Foo Fighters saved my life
This Sunday night, I was about to end my life. I took a few Painkillers, Sleeping Pills and drank some beers. I was just about to slit my wrist, when the radio played my absolute favorite song, My Hero. 
This song finally gave ma a little bit of a good feeling, a big improvement after days of pure numbness, just enough to get me to call an ambulance.

Iâ€™m now in a hospital and the suicide thoughts are finally slowly fading away. I hope, it stays this way. 

Thank you so much for reading this and please stay strong!
