DRAGLINE: Whatcha got?
KOKO: Pair'a nines.
DRAGLINE: I kin see that, brick head. I mean your hole card.
DRAGLINE: Uh-huh. And he ain't got nothing showing. Raise his head off.
KOKO: He's been betting his head from the gun. Gotta have kings.
DRAGLINE: So then you just call him.
KOKO: I call.

KOKO: Cuter.
LUKE: Kick a buck.
KOKO: Damn.
