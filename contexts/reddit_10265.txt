No one really cares, they're only trying to make themselves feel good.
A while back I removed myself from the contacts of my 'friends,' trying to isolate myself before I stepped in front of a bus. No one spoke to me, ever reached out. I had to initiate every conversation, I was the runt hanging around that no one had the balls to formally tell to fuck off. Of course, the moment I do leave, everyone suddenly cares, everyone is buzzing my phone asking what's up and how I'm doing, they even got a hold of my parents. It escalated at some point to where the only one from that group I had any respect for is on the phone pleading that I don't die, that suicide is irrational and that I should consider meds.

Guess what, I said sure, I won't die, I'll go back business as usual. And you know what, it is business as usual. I am never anyone's first choice, I haven't spoken to another human in over a month. Even when I come back from an attempt it's like I died anyway. Really glad I got talked out of it, it would fucking suck if I missed out on being ignored and forgotten again.
