Is this okay for a girl?
Would it be okay for a girl to approach a guy on the street/college? I feel like nowadays its not normal for people to approach others without it being on a dating app or online.


Also, if it is okay, what could I say? "Hey, I think you are cute, can you give me your number?"? 


I am sorry if this is a dumb question but I have been in a relationship for a long time and am now entering the dating world.
