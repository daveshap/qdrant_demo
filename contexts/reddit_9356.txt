Warning: AT&T (USA) auto upgraded all 2gb data plans to 4gb data plans
Today I was checking my bills and noticed my cell phone had increased. Apparently AT&T decided to upgrade all 2GB data plans to 4GB data plans without authorization from the customer. The representative told me that it was “just $5” for double the data.  

Just a heads up to go check your bills. If you don’t want the upgrade make sure they change it back AND request a credit. In my case it was a $9 credit (partial month, and full month). If you don’t ask for the credit, don’t expect it to automatically show up. You have to ask.
