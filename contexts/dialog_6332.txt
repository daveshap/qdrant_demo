JAKE: Listen, what I'm about to tell you, I'm telling you in confidence, okay? Have you ever heard of a company called Big.Com?
ASHBY: Big.Com. That Internet thing.
JAKE: Right. The guys who started that did what a lot of companies in the Valley do. They get a good idea, shop it around, raise some capital, then sell it off to a bigger company. Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, whatever. The beauty of it is, they've pretty much sold the company before they're even real. The bigger company is already set to buy it, all they want to do is make sure that the idea actually works. So they get some start up capital, make it work, then sell it for like five times the initial loan.
ASHBY: Sort of like a letter of intent.
JAKE: Exactly. But the Catch-22 is that you can't tell anyone about the offer, because if it's public, you could start a bidding war and that's considered a breach of etiquette. It could kill a deal. But, wait too long and you're not considered hot anymore.
ASHBY: And you have this letter of intent?
JAKE: Yes. That's why I wish there were guys willing to take a chance and live a little.
LILY: We're getting down to the wire. Apparently another company has a similar product in R&D right now. If they beat us to it...
JAKE: Off the record, I'm this close to cutting someone in on the action if it'd help.
