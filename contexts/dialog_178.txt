EMIL: Come to 45 Broadway. Don't bring the Police. Come alone or you'll be in my next film.
HAWKINS: Look asshole. I've been threatened by better than you.
EMIL: No. I'm the best that's ever threatened you.
HAWKINS: I'll meet you on one condition - I get exclusivity and you surrender to me.
EMIL: We'll talk about that. Four o'clock gives you time to go to bank. Three hundred thousand dollars.
HAWKINS: What? It doesn't work that way.
EMIL: If you don't want my film - I'll call another show. And they will show it.
HAWKINS: Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
EMIL: Come alone. Bring cash. And we'll talk about surrendering.
KORFIN: How was it?
JORDY: Not good.
DUFFY: Did the D.A. videotape her deposition?
KORFIN: Yeah. He finished awhile ago.
DUFFY: Alright. Swing by her apartment. Let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to Hoover Street. You got that?
KORFIN: Yeah.
JORDY: Chief - mind if I take her?
DUFFY: Okay. But not water sports.
