How do promotion/demotion work in CSGO? I didn't play CSGO for a few months, and now that I came back to it, I'm stuck on the lowest ranking.I must have played 15 games, not all wins, but still there was some, but I'm still with one stripe.So how does the ranking work? Can I see how far I am to ranking up?
