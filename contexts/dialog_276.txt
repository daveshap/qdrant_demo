HADEN: What the bell happened?
CATES: I lost them, that's what happened.
HADEN: How did they get away?
CATES: They ran. As fast as they could. Caught a train.
HADEN: Which one pulled the trigger?
CATES: The Indian. I was about 30 yards away.
HADEN: You couldn't get to him?
HADEN: What a screw-up.
CATES: Right. I screwed up. I fucked up. I messed up. Anybody could have done better, especially you. I bet you're real good at hitting targets through crowds.
HADEN: Don't duck the bullet Cates. Why didn't you call in for backup instead of makin' a grandstand play?
CATES: I didn't have the time.
HADEN: Too bad, it would've covered your ass. Now you're in the shit and so's the department. In case you haven't noticed, this wasn't our finest hour... I told you everyone was watchin' on this one. Maybe you better start thinkin' about writin' tickets off a three wheel bike.
HAMMOND: How you doing, man?
SOSNA: Not bad, not bad.
SOSNA: You want to go outside?
HAMMOND: Naw, right here's okay.
SOSNA: You sure?
HAMMOND: I'm sure. Everybody here's looking at everybody else's ass.
