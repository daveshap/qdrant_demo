So my father busted in my room today
I was doing my homework like the good boy i am while he busted inside while holding a plate with 5 tiny pieces of grilled meat. "EAT EM FAST" he said. I, without a question, put them all in my mouth and proceeded to eat them. He than gestures to his pocket (he had a fabric flap with velcro that covers the pocket opening). I though he had more meat there. He did not. He said "you can wipe your fingers on this". I proceed to wipe my fingers then he leaves, right after he told me "don't tell anyone". Someone would think that's weird but it's pretty normal for my papa to do this, he is indeed a goofball. This is 100% real btw.

Edit: as a clarification, he was in a hurry, the rest of the meat was still on the grill and he also made a joke by asking me to not tell anyone.
