How to fix my attitude about work?
I recall a conversation with a software engineer consultant at my job about feeling ownership of your work. I said to him it must feel different to be an independent contractor than being a full time employee for another company because as an independent contractor you then take true ownership of your work. How well you do is directly applied to your name. I thought at the time that whatever I did as a full time employee was all just under the name of the company I’m employed by. He said to me that that’s actually not how you should think about work and I think he meant to show me that as an employee anywhere you need to feel like you are responsible for your work alone and that it always directly reflects on you and your work ethic whether you are a independent contractor or or a full time employee. 

I realize that he was right and thinking about that has made me realize that I may have been doing things wrong all the time. I don’t get much feedback on my performance right now and I think that may be why I just assume that it doesn’t really matter. I don’t have that burning desire everyday to impress, that’s one of the things I want to change, switching from having to work hard to impress my superiors to working hard for myself. 

I feel like I am essentially “hiding” behind my superiors at this company. Letting them dictate what I do on projects, but they are quite independent workers themselves. So how do I change from this mindset of “oh this company is a little slow, so I’ll just fall in line” to “I am my own damn person and I’m going to go get whatever I want in this world!”?
