After 6 Weeks Unemployed, I Finally Got A Job
Applied to dozens of jobs, had about 5 interviews and felt the job hunt was going no where. Because I was once unemployed for about 3 months before, I fell into slight depression thinking that that was going to happen all over again. Luckily, I got a call in from another job and the hiring manager called me in. I didnt have high hopes for this one but I actually got the job. Its nothing fancy. Its an entry level job but I was literally on my last dime lol. I had $42 left in my bank account! Just glad I finally have a job now.
