What does current evidence and analysis say about the economic effect of a minimum wage increase?
[Pew Research reports](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/01/04/5-facts-about-the-minimum-wage/) that the Federal minimum wage has lost nearly 10% of its purchasing power in the last decade due to inflation, with less than half (45%) of workers in that margin composed of workers that would be considered young, new entrants into the workforce (16-25 years old).

From this, one could infer that more than half of the hourly workforce is past the point that a job paying higher than minimum would be expected, i.e. 'work experience,' with [most salaried workers receiving a three percent raise annually](https://www.shrm.org/hr-today/news/hr-magazine/0516/Pages/0516-fair-compensation.aspx).

One of the many [chief arguments opposing a wage increase](http://www.aei.org/publication/ten-reasons-economists-object-to-the-minimum-wage/) is that increasing such a wage may drive retailers to increase their prices to recoup the costs, defeating the purpose of a wage increase if said increase is to amp up the spending power of the labor class.

However, [as anecdotally reported by CNBC](http://www.cnbc.com/2016/07/21/adjusted-for-inflation-the-federal-minimum-wage-is-worth-less-than-50-years-ago.html) in the case of a Pennsylvania-based restaurant chain's $1.50 wage increase to minimum wage workers, spending power of the restaurant owner's employees was increased while his profits remained relatively unaffected, inferred by him to be because the employees were able to spend more money both at his restaurants as well as in other local chains.
