Drove on the highway for the first time in over a year despite extreme driving anxiety!!
Almost every time I drive I shake really bad, have a really high heart rate, and even sometimes cry. It's hard to ever bring myself to drive even to the local store let alone on the highway. Today I had no choice because I had a dentist appointment in a far city, so I finally drove on a busy highway (and it was raining like mad as well!!) And it actually wasn't that bad. I mean, I'm still not a fan, but it definitely wasn't as terrifying as I thought it'd be. 

I'm happy for this progress because I am an adult and can't keep asking everyone for rides. This also hopefully means I can get a job in a farther city if one becomes available :) Yay!!
