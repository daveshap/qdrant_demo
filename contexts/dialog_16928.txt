CREASY: Did you sleep alright?
PINTA: Yes.
CREASY: How's the ankle? Can you put your weight on it?
PINTA: It's not too bad. Will it take a long time before it's better? Our big swim meet is in three weeks. Interschools. I was going to swim in the one hundred meter freestyle.
CREASY: In a week you should be fine.
PINTA: Doesn't matter. I always finish second.
CREASY: You need to practice.
