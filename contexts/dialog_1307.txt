KEVIN: Vicky...last night...I wasn't lying.
VICKY: I know. Let's go. Don't you have something to tell your friends?
KEVIN: What?
VICKY: Your little pact. Jessica told me all about it. Way to go, Kev!
KEVIN: I guess we'll call you two-ply.
OZ: Yeah. So you want double condiments on that?
JIM: No, no that's fine. So you doing okay?
KEVIN: Yeah.
FINCH: I'll tell you, I've learned one thing: women, like wine, get better with age. Of course, I have no frame of reference for this comparison.
KEVIN: So Oz, you almost made it, huh?
OZ: I'll just say that we had a great night together.
JIM: Hang in there, buddy, you'll get there.
OZ: I know.
KEVIN: Wow. You two really have something going, don't you?
OZ: I think we're falling in love.
