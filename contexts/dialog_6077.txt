SUSAN: How do you want to handle the whole thing - ask questions?
THOMPSON: I'd rather you just talked. Anything that comes into your mind - about yourself and Mr. Kane.
SUSAN: You wouldn't want to hear a lot of what comes into my mind about myself and Mr. Charlie Kane.
THOMPSON: How did you meet him?
SUSAN: I had a toothache.
