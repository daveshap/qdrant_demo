BOYD: After you drop the kids off, take Micheal home. Put a few drinks in him so he'll sleep.
FISHER: I don't think that's such a good idea.
BOYD: Just do it.
FISHER: What are you going to do?
BOYD: Take care of business.
FISHER: What does that mean?
BOYD: And what does that mean? Are you insane?! You think I would hurt Lois?! She's the mother of those kids! What is wrong with you?
FISHER: I don't know...
BOYD: You got a nasty side to your thought process.
