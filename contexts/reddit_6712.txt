Will it rub a recruiter the wrong way if I ask for a speedy start to hiring process?
I'm in final round interviews but some jobs I've applied to are just contacting me for phone screens. An in house recruiter reached out to me and after I said I was interested, sent me a calendly link for a phone screen next week Friday. Is it arrogant to mention "hey I'm in final round interviews?" I mentioned this to a hiring manager at the end of a call 3 days ago, and its the first time I haven't moved past the phone screen so I'm wondering if I shouldn't have said anything. 

I'm not trying to flex that I have interviews, but in that previous circumstance, they mentioned the next step is a few weeks away so I felt I had no choice. Should I wait until the second round to bring it up? Maybe from the initial call they would feel like they are plenty of fish in the sea, but once they get attached they would be receptive to accelerating the process?
