Election day megathread
Hello NeutralPolitics readers!

We will be doing two megathreads today.  This one during the voting period where we'll be collecting news and other information relevant to the ongoing election, and then a second thread starting around 7 PM EST for results as they come in.

And while NeutralPolitics is neutral as to who you should vote for, we do encourage all of our American readers to cast ballots today.
