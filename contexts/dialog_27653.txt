MITCH: I wonder if you could help me.
MELANIE: What?
MITCH: I said I wonder if you could help me.
MELANIE: Yes, what was it you were looking for, sir?
MITCH: Lovebirds.
MELANIE: Lovebirds, sir?
MITCH: Yes. I understand there are different varieties, it that true?
MELANIE: Well... yes, sir, there are.
MITCH: These are for my sister... her birthday you see. As she'll be eleven and... well, frankly, I wouldn't want a pair of birds that were too demonstrative.
MELANIE: I understand completely, sir.
MITCH: As the same time, I wouldn't want birds that were aloof, either.
MELANIE: No, of course not.
MITCH: Do you have a pair that are just friendly?
MELANIE: I think so, sir. Now then, let me see.
MITCH: Aren't these lovebirds?
MELANIE: No, sir, those are... redbirds.
MITCH: The sign says strawberry finches.
MELANIE: Yes, we call them that too. Ahhh, here we are, Lovebirds...
MITCH: Those are canaries, Miss. Doesn't this make you feel awful?
MELANIE: Doesn't what make me...?
MITCH: All these innocent little creatures caged up like this?
MELANIE: Well, we can't just let them fly around the shop, you know.
MITCH: I suppose not. Is there an ornithological reason for keeping them in separate cages?
MELANIE: Oh, certainly. It's to protect the species.
MITCH: I imagine that's very important. Especially during the moulting season.
MELANIE: Yes, that's a particularly dangerous time.
MITCH: Are they moulting now?
MELANIE: Some of them are.
MITCH: How can you tell?
MELANIE: Well... they get a sort of hangdog expression.
MITCH: Yes, I see. About those lovebirds, Miss...
MELANIE: Are you sure you wouldn't like to see a canary instead? We have some very nice canaries this week.
MITCH: All right. She smiles back.
