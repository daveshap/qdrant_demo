After months of searching, I found my dream job. 17 days later I was let go.
I’m so gutted. I was let go because I was “trying to change everything”. I don’t understand, they listed off all these tasks that needed revamping, and my boss told me she wanted me to get her approval every time. So I would write up drafts of new letters to show her, and she told me she heard things from others (wouldn’t tell me what) and that I was changing too much. For the first time in my life I found a job I really loved and somehow I flushed it. Sorry, just need to get it out. Back to the unemployment board.
