Slight random dull aches in testicle with no other signs
I've recently been experiencing random dull aches in my left testicle, that never show up at a certain time of day, with no other warning signs. The pain is not severe, there are no visual lumps or swelling, and I do not have any family history of testicular cancer. I do however have bad medical anxiety and white coat syndrome so i was wondering if anyone could help me out. 

P.S, I am 13 years of age, which is also out of the normal age range for testicular cancer (still tho, I got a panic attack over ear pains, my medical anxiety is bad).

Quick Clarification: I realize now that "dull ache" is an actual medical term that is even worse pain than i am experiencing. Both my mom and dad told me that as my body grows I will experience moments of slight discomfort (a more accurate way of describing how It feels) in that certain area.
