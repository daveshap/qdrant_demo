GLEN: Whenever I get nervous I eat.
NANCY: And if you can't do that, you sleep.
GLEN: Used to. Not anymore.
GLEN: You ever read about the Balinese way of dreaming?
NANCY: No.
GLEN: They got a whole system they call 'dream skills'. So, if you have a nightmare, for instance like falling, right?
NANCY: Yeah.
GLEN: Instead of screaming and getting nuts, you say, okay, I'm gonna make up my mind that I fall into a magic world where I can get something special, like a poem or song. They get all their art literature from dreams. Just wake up and write it down. Dream skills.
NANCY: And what if they meet a monster in their dream? Then what?
GLEN: They turn their back on it. Takes away its energy, and it disappears.
NANCY: What happens if they don't do that?
GLEN: I guess those people don't wake up to tell what happens.
NANCY: Great.
GLEN: 'Booby Traps and Improvised Antipersonnel Devices'!
NANCY: I found it at this neat survivalist bookstore on Ventura.
GLEN: Well what you reading it for?
