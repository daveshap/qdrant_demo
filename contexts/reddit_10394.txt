I cried tonight realizing that suicide was not an option anymore
For most of my life, I have found tremendous comfort in knowing that suicide was a dependable way out when everything was just too much.  Like a safety net... but the opposite.  In my mind I would play out different scenarios -- some quick and practical, others more extravagant and poetic.  I would always get that same feeling of freedom that people do when they imagine winning the lotto.  It was a huge help.

Recently, I have been supporting my wife through a very difficult period of grieving, and tonight I realized that if I was to end my life, it would completely break her.  So now, with great sadness, I have had to say goodbye to my reliable friend and protector.  The future seems so much harder now.  Thanks for listening.
