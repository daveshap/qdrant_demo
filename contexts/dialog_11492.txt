PREYSING: Well now, Miss Flaemm, we can talk.
KRINGELEIN: Some champagne, Miss Flaemm?
PREYSING: You may go, Mr. Kringelein.
KRINGELEIN: Does the world belong to you, Mr. Preysing?
PREYSING: What is this insolence?
KRINGELEIN: Do you think you have free license to be insulting? Believe me you have not. You think you're superior, but you're quite an ordinary man.
PREYSING: Go away -- go away.
FLAEMMCHEN: Please -- please!
KRINGELEIN: You don't like to see me enjoying myself.
PREYSING: Who are you? -- An embezzler most likely.
KRINGELEIN: An embezzler -- you're going to take that back, right here in the presence of this young lady -- who do you think you're talking to? You think I'm dirt, if I'm dirt, you're a lot dirtier, Mr. Industrial Magnate Preysing.
PREYSING: You're discharged.
KRINGELEIN: Me?
PREYSING: Yes you -- shut your mouth -- get out -- you're discharged.
