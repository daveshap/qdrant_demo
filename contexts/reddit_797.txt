Am I really not good enough?
It all started on the 31st of July 2018 when my sister got a job at a really good company. Believe me, I was really happy for her. I always will be, I mean she worked really hard for it and she completely deserves it. But the thing is, my parents were soo happy. My dad even started crying. 
I mean it's okay really, but that got me thinking of how I never gave my parents that sort of happiness. They were constantly talking about how great of a job she has and how it's so prestigious for them. It was sweet at first but after a while it became our every night dinner discussion. And if thing didn't get worse they started bringing me up. How I would have to outshow my sister and get into a good college. After months of hearing these things everyday, I started getting triggered. I would often have panic attacks and even mental breakdowns. I told my parents about this and their reply was that they had every right to have expectations from me.
 This continued till January when I got so depressed that I started cutting myself. I eventually got help from my friend and now I am a lot more stable but I still feel terrified to not be able to live up to their expectations.
