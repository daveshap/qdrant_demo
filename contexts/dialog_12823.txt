BURNS: For Pete's sake, Hildy, they're waiting for the rest of that story!
HILDY: Okay, Walter.
BRUCE: I waited and waited and then I had an idea and wired Albany to send me a hundred dollars so I could get out on bail... I don't know what they'll think -- they sent it to the police station!
HILDY: We'll explain the whole thing to them.
BRUCE: I know I got you into this, Hildy, but it does seem to me that you can't care much for me if you're willing to let me stay locked up for two hours.
HILDY: Bruce, you know I'm mad about you and stop talking like that. Walter!
