ANNIE: The answer's no.
TOM: You haven't heard the question yet. Truth is, you'd be doing me a favor. I got all these eager young colts need riding and poor old Rimrock here is feeling kind of left out...
ANNIE: Poor thing.
TOM: He'd be grateful, he'd take real good care with you.
ANNIE: Is this how you're going to make me pay my phone bill?
TOM: No, ma'am, I'm afraid that's extra.
TOM: Relax our center... It's just sitting in a bucket.
ANNIE: Yeah, it's been a while, but I... I remember the basic ideas...
TOM: OK. I'll stop talking then.
ANNIE: Actually, I never rode Western. I'm sorry. Go ahead.
TOM: Well, he don't know that. Just sit the horse. Good... You have a nice seat.
ANNIE: Thanks.
TOM: Feel good?
ANNIE: Yeah.
TOM: You look all right. You want to pick it up a little?
ANNIE: OK.
