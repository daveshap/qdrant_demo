How do I talk with a recruiter?
Sorry if I sound dumb. Anyway, I have my linkedin set so it shows I am looking for a new job. A recruiter (with many mutual contacts) reached out to me and sent me a kind of vague message saying "Let me know how I can help you!". Is this a usual recruiter approach?

How do I respond that isn't "Please give me new job." Should I let them know what industry/field I am interested in or tell them my experience?
