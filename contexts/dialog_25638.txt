TEENAGER: I'm telling you, you're going to find him at the roadblock, or right after, or not at all.
JENNY: If he didn't want to go through the roadblock, is there any other way to get to Vegas?
TEENAGER: Fly.
TEENAGER: The five-fifty. We already passed it. But it'll take him way out of his way.
JENNY: Pull over. I've got to get back there.
TEENAGER: Why wouldn't he want to go through the roadblock?... What did you guys do?... I won't tell anybody.
JENNY: It's easier not to tell if you don't know.
TEENAGER: Wait. Could I have your autograph?
JENNY: Sure.
TEENAGER: I have nothing to do. I'd like to help you.
JENNY: Don't worry. I'll be all right.
