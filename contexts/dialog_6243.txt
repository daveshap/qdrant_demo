VINCENT: How long you think this'll take?
MAX: Twenty-four minutes.
VINCENT: Twenty-four? Not twenty-five? Or twenty-three?
MAX: Two minutes to get on Broadway. They're doing some roadwork around the bridge. Eleven to get downtown. Four to the Lower East Side. Six to clear the roadwork. One minute margin for error. My math says twenty-four.
VINCENT: Mind if I time you? What do I get if you're wrong? A free ride?
MAX: An apology.
MAX: First time in New York?
VINCENT: Third, but I still can't tell uptown from downtown. Tell the truth, whenever I'm here, I can't wait to leave. Place gets to me. Too loud, too fast...too much. You like it here?
MAX: It's home.
VINCENT: You share it with over three million people every day. You know that's the population of New Zealand? What's Manhattan, thirteen miles long? That's a lot of misery crammed into thirteen miles. Read about this one guy. Gets on the subway and dies. Six hours he's riding around before anybody notices. Think about that. Here's this corpse doing laps around Manhattan courtesy of the New York transit system, people getting on and off, sitting next to him, and still nobody catches on. Three million. That's too damn many people.
MAX: I see your point.
VINCENT: You know, this is the cleanest cab I've ever been in. This your regular ride?
MAX: Yeah. I share it with the dayshift guy.
VINCENT: You prefer nights?
MAX: People are more relaxed. Less stress, less traffic, better tips.
VINCENT: You on some kind of work plan?
MAX: You mean like benefits?
VINCENT: Yeah. Retirement? Paid sick leave?
MAX: It's not that kind of job.
VINCENT: You should start a union.
MAX: Me, specifically?
VINCENT: Why not?
MAX: Last thing I need is a reason to keep hacking. This job's a fill-in.
VINCENT: Oh? How long you been doing this?
MAX: Twelve years. But I'm working on other stuff...
VINCENT: Like what?
MAX: I don't talk about it, you know... No offense.
VINCENT: None taken. There are talkers and doers. I like doers.
VINCENT: Twenty-four minutes! Man, you're hot...
MAX: Yeah. Lucky with the lights.
VINCENT: Bullshit. You probably know the light schedules, too. Listen, I'm in town tonight on a closing. Five stops, one night. I gotta catch a six a.m. flight. I got five stops to make, see some friends, collect some signatures. Why don't you hang with me?
MAX: I'm not a hire car. It's against regs?
VINCENT: Regulations? These guys don't even give you sick leave. How much you pull down on a good night?
MAX: Two, two-fifty.
VINCENT: I'll make it an even five hundred. Plus an extra hundred if you get me to LAX on time.
