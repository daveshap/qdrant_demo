BOBBY: You flirt with me, then you run cold. You lead me on, then slap me down. I don't go for being jerked around.
GRACE: Really? And what game did you want to play? You carry my box for me, and I fall into bed with you?
BOBBY: I think I can find my own way back to into town.
GRACE: Maybe I like to find out about a man first. Maybe I like to know what he's made of.
BOBBY: I'm just flesh and blood, baby. That and a few memories of bad women; just like most guys. But you already know that. You read my mind, remember? Thanks for the lemonade.
GRACE: You never did answer my question.
BOBBY: Still playing?
GRACE: That's not an answer. What is it you want?
BOBBY: You know what I want.
GRACE: Maybe I just want to hear you say it.
