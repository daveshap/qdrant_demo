MILES: Hello?
MARYLIN: Miles?
MILES: Yes? Marylin?
MARYLIN: You're right about me. I am worthless. I am nothing. I don't deserve to live.
MILES: Marylin? When did I say...?
MARYLIN: I don't blame them for betraying me. I don't blame Rex, or Howard or my father. You see, Miles, I'm going to tell you something about me. Something you may or may not know. I suck!
MARYLIN: Screw you, asswipe!
MILES: Marylin? Forgive me but are you -- drunk?
MARYLIN: A little. You get out of the car. That's right, Fuctard. I'm talkin' to you!
MILES: You shouldn't be driving. Where are you?
MARYLIN: I'm on Sunset. Near the Beverly Hills hotel. Wanna meet me for a drink in the Polo...?
MILES: I live right near there. The 800 Block of Maple. Come here. Marylin -- come here right now before -- just come here.
MARYLIN: Okay. Should I stop at Starbucks and pick up a blended for --
MILES: No. Don't stop.
MARYLIN: Okay Miles.
