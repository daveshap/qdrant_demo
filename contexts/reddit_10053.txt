Entering International Student Advising
Hey Reddit,

I am currently in graduate school for a Masters in Teaching English as a Second Language. I have become interested in International Student Advising and International Student Affairs after teaching international students at my university and handling interactions with their advisers as well as just interacting with students from many different and diverse backgrounds. I guess my question is would TESL be considered a related field? Or would I have to go back to school for a Masters in Higher Education or Education? I also lived abroad for four years in a foreign language environment.

A second question is would it be worth it to go to conferences such as NASPA or NAFSA in order to attend workshops on F1 and J1 visa regulations or would the online versions of those workshops through the same organizations be sufficient?

Sorry for all the questions!
