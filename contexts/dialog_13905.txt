LESTAT: Your mama's left you with us. She wants you to be happy.
LOUIS: You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!
LESTAT: Shhhh! Do you want to frighten our little daughter?
CLAUDIA: I'm not your daughter.
LESTAT: Yes you are, my dearest. You are mine and Louis' daughter. You see Louis was going to leave us. He was going to go away. But now he's not. He's going to stay and make you happy.
