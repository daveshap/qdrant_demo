Anyone in a Chicago or suburban Chicago area? Hitting dead ends all over the place and I'm feeling insecure.
Hello all,

I made a post recently on critiquing my resume, which I received wonderful feedback on. I'm posting today because quite frankly, I'm stuck. I posted on being an Academic Advisor but was instructed to start smaller, somewhere like admissions.

Well, the only opening available for admissions that I seem to have good odds with is at DeVry. Needless to say, it's DeVry. You're more of a salesperson and every person I've talked to about DeVry  has instructed me to stay far, far, away.

That's left me in a conundrum. I work at a University in a student position, but I want to do something more. I have my BA and I'm a few months away from my MA, yet I feel as if there's just absolutely no opening available right now.

Could anyone (especially a Chicagoan), give any advice as to how the hell to succeed?

Love ya'll
