How to handle a coworker who thinks he is management?
We got this new employee who was hired as temp to hire. He has been there for about a month, he is a serious ass kisser and within a couple days we realized he is a snitch as well. 

He has gotten in tight with the supervisor and now acts like he is part of management. Many others are really annoyed with him as well but it seems he really has something against me.  If I leave the room, he will question the others about where I went. If I am running an operation in another part of the building, he will question others why I am taking long to do the task. He will show up out of nowhere to i guess "check on me" at my work station and made a point to lay eyes on my laptop to see what I was doing. 

Also, If I am on my phone he will complain to others about why I am on the phone. If I am 10 minutes late to work, he will complain to others about my tardiness. I was out of work for 2 days because my kids school got cancelled due to weather and he was complaining to others that i miss too many days of work when it was literally the only 2 days I missed since he was there lol

I am not sure why he has targeted me but I am going to assume its because I am the defacto group leader (without the title) and he wants to be the man.

I work for a California based tech company and we have a really relaxed and laid back culture and work environment and this dude is killing the vibe.
