What should I do if it's been 2 weeks and my Schengen visa has not been approved I applied for a Netherlands visa at the VFS center in San Francisco and the status says it was forwarded to the Netherlands Embassy for further processing 15 days ago. I am worried whether VFS has misplaced my passport as I have my US visa in my passport. What should I do?
