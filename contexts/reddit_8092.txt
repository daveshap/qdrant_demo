Question about funds for thesis project? (Canadian)
Hello! I'm a current master's student in Canada with a question about research funding for thesis projects. I'm currently holding a national scholarship, so I myself am being funded to complete my MSc, but my thesis project is not funded by any of my supervisor's grants, so I guess the project itself counts as unfunded?

Basically I'm having trouble recruiting participants for my thesis project without any sort of compensation (people have emailed me, stating their interest, but then pull out of participating once they realize they won't be compensated for the 30\-minute interview). **I was wondering whether it would be appropriate for me to ask my supervisor if I could use some of their research funds as compensation for my study participants** (say, maybe a $5 coffee shop gift card for each of them).

I'm just not really sure how the funding of graduate student thesis projects usually works (does it vary by country? or by school?), and was wondering if anybody could give me any clarification regarding this issue. Thanks in advance.
