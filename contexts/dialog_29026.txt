SALLY: That's the truth--every single word!
MCKINNEY: I sincerely hope so--
SALLY: Why should <U>I</U> kill him?
MCKINNEY: For a very excellent reason from your own admission-- --I'm not saying you <U>did</U>--but I think you know more than you're telling. Years of experience have taught me to mistrust circumstantial evidence. Nevertheless, in your case there's plenty of it.
BRETT: Thought you might need me--don't talk, kid, and don't let him scare you--
MCKINNEY: Don't be too smart, Jimmy--you're out in the rough yourself. You had an argument with Lother a couple of hours before he was killed--but I'll deal with that later--
