ERNEST: It always amazes me, Lil, how you can whip up a hot, hearty meal out of thin air.
LILLIAN: I can thank you for that. It was a hard-earned talent.
LILLIAN: Bread?
ERNEST: Thank you.
LILLIAN: When's the last time you saw a hundred dollars, Ernest Farmer?
FRANCES: Mama...
LILLIAN: I'm not hungry. You two just enjoy yourselves. After all, this is a celebration.
ERNEST: I'm... I'm really proud of you, Frances.
FRANCES: Thanks, Dad.
ERNEST: An essay contest... a national contest. That's pretty impressive.
FRANCES: I didn't have much to do with it.
ERNEST: You wrote it, didn't you?
FRANCES: Yeah, I suppose... Dad, who's Harry York?
ERNEST: Well, Harry York is a guy who... well, he does a lot of things. Why do you ask?
FRANCES: He talked to me today. Told me to keep my mouth shut or I'd get everybody in trouble.
ERNEST: Yeah... well... it's possible. Harry York and I both work for Mr. Kaminski right now, and... well... There are lots of folks in this country who never got a square break. That's the way of things, but Mr. Kaminski wants to change it, and when it comes to new ideas, the people in power get nervous.
FRANCES: Is Kaminski a Communist?
ERNEST: No, no, no. All he wants to do is see the common man get a little representation.
FRANCES: He's a socialist, then?
