AMY: Look at my ring.
EDWARD: That's a fine-looking ring.
AMY: A lady threw it to me.
EDWARD: Most surely that was a nice lady to give a ring to a little girl.
AMY: It's a pretty ring.
EDWARD: I wouldn't be surprised if it were a true wishing ring.
AMY: A ring that I can wish on like I wished on the candles?
EDWARD: Maybe, if it's a real mourning ring like we have in Jamaica. All you got to do is turn it on your finger, close your eyes, and make a wish.
AMY: the ring up to him) What's a mourning ring?
EDWARD: They're given to the living in memory of the dead. If this is a real one -- I can't be sure -- you can make a wish, and it will come true in the twinkling of an eye.
AMY: Well, if it's a real mourning ring,. I'm going to think hard for something I want more than anything else in the world before I wish.
EDWARD: That's the clever way to do it.
