I created a survey but got zero credit/recognition...
I’m in a position where there’s practically zero opportunities to grow in my office. I graduated last year and so I’m the freshest face in our office of 5. When I was hired I was told because I have an outside perspective that want me to help improve the program, review and provide improvements for policies and procedures.

One huge recommendation was an annual or bi-annual survey. So they had me take the lead on it. So I created two surveys and told them we can edit whatever, add/delete, change anything. I also asked for feedback. This was also 2 months ago. I followed up with my boss about two weeks later and they said they’ll review it and get back to me.

5 minutes ago I received an email from my boss to the 4 of us. She had sent out my survey, made it live, collecting data, and didn’t say a word to me, not even as a “thanks, this is awesome, we’re gonna go ahead and make it live and send it out.”

I feel bad for feeling upset, but at the same time I spent a lot of time putting it together a long survey and didn’t receive ANY communication that it was going live nor feedback on it.
