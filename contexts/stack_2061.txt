Is \"rescrew\" a word or local dialect? I heard people saying something like this:<blockquote>  We have to \"rescrew\" [e.g.] a tissue box holster to the wall.</blockquote>I'm not sure, is the syllable \"re\" common? It seems this is not too commonly used.What are possible synonyms / more common terms?
