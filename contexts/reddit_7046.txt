Given 2 Equally Awful Options at My Company
**Edit**: I do have equity in this company. Forgot to include that.

To put it in perspective, I've been working with this company before it became an official LLC. I worked for free for almost 3 years to make this happen because I was passionate about the we were doing and I wanted to see this company succeed. I still do, but after what I was informed I'm actually shook right now.

I was originally brought on as remote full-time and eventually I'd have to move to their HQ (where the majority of the workers were.) Fair enough, I didn't get paid even close to what I should be making at the start but we were an early company and I believed in the vision, so I understood that my fiancee (girlfriend at the time) and I would have to move there eventually. My thought process was if I got a salary adjustment, my fiancee and I would discuss it more in depth and finally decide when the time would be right (which would primarily be with the salary adjustment since I live in a very expensive area currently, and saving up has almost been impossible.)

So the months go on and here I am at about 9 months as a full-time employee. I get informed last night that I have two options:

**1.)** Move there with a slight salary increase (a super small percentage of an even lower than entry-level salary given 6 years in my field), 12 months of guaranteed employment, and they'd give me a small amount for travel (less than $1,000.)

**2.)** Become a contractor and lose all my benefits (and eventually be pushed out when they found someone more local to them.)

I am absolutely devastated right now. The incentive for moving is not there, and even made worse that I have to pay an absurd amount for a lease break among other financial commitments coming up (we literally just signed for a wedding venue *yesterday*.) Since I couldn't save up a lot I would clearly be going into the red for this move, and as much as my fiancee is well-off financially and can help afford things, I can't place her into this financial burden with me. On top of this, she would have to find a new job there and disconnect from all of her friends and social activities she does. I feel ashamed

On the other hand, going contractor literally feels like I'm losing my job but in a "nice corporate way." I would have to get on my fiancee's health insurance through eloping early because I have a reoccurring medical condition and I *have* to have decent insurance for, less I pay an absurd out-of-pocket every year. Then finding a job around where I live would be insanely difficult because the market for my career here is abysmal. I worked too hard for this...

I'm at a loss. I talk to my CEO today in a few hours to hear more about it, but after busting my ass for almost 5 years working 60-80 hour weeks... I don't know. 

I have nothing to ask of anyone, so I suppose this is just a warning to people: a company doesn't give a fuck about you if it means saving them money.

Be careful out there.
