Working remotely, can I move without telling my boss?
I am a contingent worker (hired through a staffing company) at a tech company in Silicon Valley. I’ve been there for 1.5 years, with my next 6 month contract extension coming up in August. I was planning on finding a new job and moving to Texas after finishing my master’s degree in May, but with everything going on there aren’t a ton of openings. If my contract is not extended I will move (to be local when applying for new roles) as I have sufficient savings to be comfortable doing so, but in the case I keep my current role, it is appealing to continue making a Silicon Valley salary in Texas (at least until they need me to return to the office). If I am extended (which is my expectation), my boss has made it clear that our team should expect to continue working from home at least through the end of 2020. The way things are going we haven’t had anyone return to the office yet, so I expect longer. Could I move and not tell my manager? How bad of an idea is this?
