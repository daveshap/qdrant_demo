Validity of Certification Courses
A couple years ago, I took a job as a Reading Specialist. One of my goals was to leave formal classroom teaching. This year I’m teaching six classes...

There are new schools opening all the time in my district, and it’s pretty easy to transfer. Testing Coordinator is a job which posts a lot, and I’m fully qualified except for MS Excel experience. I have general experience with Excel both for personal and work use, but I’d say I’m still at novice level.

I’m thinking of taking various Excel certifications. Do employers take this seriously, or do they want hands on experience? I assume they’d want the latter if Excel is the focus of the job, but it’s only part of it.
