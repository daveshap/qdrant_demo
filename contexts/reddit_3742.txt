If you ask someone out and they respond with "Thanks for the invite but...", No matter what the reason that follows (even if it is legitimate) accept that they aren't interested in you.
I have had this response given to me a few times recently but when you read between the lines, although they may mean it when they say thanks for the invite, its just a generous way of saying "you're cool but I'm not feeling the potential for "us" tbh". All you can do is move on from them and find someone who is feeling it ðŸ‘Œ

Okay so, funnily enough, a situation just happened which kinda contradicts a few of the replies to this post (not the post itself). If you are communicating really well with the other person and they write something like "I am working/busy during [insert time] :)" you can push to see if they are free another time. I just did this and even though the girl I am talking to (not the same girl in the original post) works till late, after a little push she suggested that she is fine to go out after her work shift even though it'll be pretty late. So ultimately, even if they don't immediately suggest an alternative time, don't immediately assume they aren't interested but this does depend on the chemistry and comfortablity y'all are showing beforehand.
