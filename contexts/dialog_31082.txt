LULA: Sure is a big deal round here... Alamo Road, Alamo Street, Alamo Square, Alamo Buildin', Alamo Alamo. They ain't forgettin' about it in a hurry. That's the thing 'bout memory? Some things you wish you could forget... What's troublin' you, sugar?
SAILOR: You know, Lula, I never told you what all I was doin' before I met you.
LULA: I just figured you was out bein' Mr. Cool...
SAILOR: Not exactly, sugar... One reason we're in all the trouble we're in right now is cause of what I was doin'... I tried to tell you this before...
LULA: You're scarin' me, baby.
SAILOR: Well, there's a good side as well as a bad side to it... The good side is I knew your daddy, and I thought Clyde was a good ol' guy...
LULA: You knew my daddy?
SAILOR: Yes I did... I sure did... The bad side of it is I did some drivin' for a man named Marcello Santos...
LULA: Oh shit...
SAILOR: I quit workin' for 'im, but just before I did, I ended up one night at a house... I don't know what it is they all think I saw that night, but I was just sittin' out in the car till the whole place went up in flames.
LULA: God, Sailor... That's the night my daddy died.
SAILOR: I know, sugar... But while the place was burnin'... Before Santos came out - I pitched some rocks at the second floor windows case anyone was upstairs sleepin'... Afterwards... When I met you, I always liked to think I mighta saved your life.
LULA: That's some big secret you been carryin', Sailor.
SAILOR: We all got a secret side, baby. Hope you don't think I been lyin' to you 'bout other things, sugar.
LULA: How'd you know my daddy?
SAILOR: Met him through Santos... Clyde - your daddy - had some sorta business deal with Santos.
SAILOR: Lula, you there?
LULA: Yeah, I'm here.
SAILOR: You upset with me?
LULA: No, Sailor darlin'. Just shockin' sometimes when things aren't the way you thought they were... I been carryin' a secret too...
