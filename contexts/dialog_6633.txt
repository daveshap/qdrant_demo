MICHAEL: I sure know what that feels like.
LETTY: And all the plans we have.
MICHAEL: Yeah, the plans.
LETTY: I've been thinking I could try to visit you at night after work, and then there'd be more time on weekends to see...
MICHAEL: Letty, please.
MICHAEL: Like I've told you before I don't want you taking care of me.
LETTY: Someone has to take care of you right now, Michael. You tore up the apartment. You stopped taking your medications.
MICHAEL: But that wasn't me. I didn't mean to do that.
LETTY: Well then why'd it happen?
MICHAEL: I don't know. I don't fucking know.
LETTY: I'm sorry. I didn't come here to blame you.
MICHAEL: I didn't mean for any of this to happen.
LETTY: Oh, God, Michael, I know. Why does everything have to be so hard?
LETTY: What are we going to do?
MICHAEL: What do you want to do?
LETTY: I know I don't want to lose you. I don't think I could stand it.
