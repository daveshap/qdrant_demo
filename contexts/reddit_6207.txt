Asking for time off for doctors appointment in a new job
I got a job that I starts the 5th. But I have started to have grip problems in my dominant hand. The problem I think is a pinched or entrapped nerve. I was to see a doctor for it. I also have an annual checkup at a different doctor that I need to do. But how do I go about this? Do I set up the appointments and then just tell them I cant show up on that day? Do I tell them why?
