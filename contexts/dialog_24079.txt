CHRISTY: Hey -- your prayers have been answered. I'm leaving. In just a couple of days.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Really. Well, that makes two of us.
CHRISTY: What?
MOTHER SUPERIOR: I have submitted my resignation to Bishop O'Hara. Privately. I have asked to be relocated as soon as possible.
CHRISTY: But -- why?
MOTHER SUPERIOR: I must go where I can be of use.
CHRISTY: But -- there's so much more to do right here. And look, if it's about me, I mean, I'm gone.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Indeed. After how long? A few weeks? I have been here thirty years. And yet, it would seem, I know nothing.
CHRISTY: But everything that's happening is good! You can be a part of it!
MOTHER SUPERIOR: A part of what? Mary Clarence, it is one thing to rabble rouse, to sweep into town and declare a holiday. You have raised the Sisters' expectations, you have excited and confused them. They imagine this neighborhood to be some sort of delightful ongoing block party.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: You and I know that life is not so simple. There will be disappointments. Rude shocks. And you will have vanished. How... fortunate.
CHRISTY: Okay, so I just got things started. But you could build on that. You could keep it going.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: I am sorry, Mary Clarence. I seem to have misplaced my tambourine. Good day, Mary Clarence.
CHRISTY: But...
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Good day.
