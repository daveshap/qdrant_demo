WILLIAM: ... can I just say 'no' to your kind request and leave it at that?
ANNA: ... Yes, that's fine. Of course. I... you know... of course... I'll just... be getting along then... nice to see you.
WILLIAM: The truth is...
WILLIAM: ... with you, I'm in real danger. It took like a perfect situation, apart from that foul temper of yours -- but my relatively inexperienced heart would, I fear, not recover if I was once again ... cast aside, which I would absolutely expect to be. There are too many pictures of you everywhere, too many films. You'd go and I'd be... well, buggered, basically.
ANNA: I see. That reality is a real 'no,' isn't it?
WILLIAM: I live in Notting Hill. You live in Beverly Hills. Everyone in the world knows who you are. My mother has trouble remembering my name.
ANNA: Okay. Fine. Fine. Good decision.
