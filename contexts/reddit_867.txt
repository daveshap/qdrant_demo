"Trusting your gut feeling" is a lot more difficult when you have anxiety.
I often hear that when your gut tells you something, it's usually right. But how does this work when you're anxious about every little thing? I never know if it's a true warning or just my anxiety making something out of nothing. It's like my gut is crying wolf all the time.
