ANNIE: I crossed the street--it was the New York Yankees spring training field--tok, tok, tok, was the sound of a ball hitting a bat-- and I sat in the warm bleachers to think about my mother... And I saw him.
CRASH: Who?
ANNIE: Thurman Munson. He was covered with dirt and he was fighting with everybody--it was beautiful ... And he called the ump a cocksucker and got thrown out of the game even though it was an exhibition! So I stayed in the bleachers all spring and gradually came to understand what's so great about baseball.
CRASH: What's so great about baseball?
ANNIE: If you know where home plate is, then you know where 1st base is, and 2nd, and everything else-- 'cause they're always in the same place in relation to home. Don't you see? If you know where home plate is, then you know where everything else in the universe is!
CRASH: I don't know if I'd go that far.
ANNIE: It's true, It's true! Least it used to be true. It ain't possible that baseball's not enough anymore, is it, Crash?
CRASH: It's possible.
ANNIE: No.
CRASH: Are you gonna be waking up next to 20 year old ballplayers when you're 60?
ANNIE: Well...I used to think that wasn't the worst thing in the world to look forward to. Lately I'm not so sure.
CRASH: Why not?
ANNIE: Whatta you mean why not"? Are you gonna play forever?!"
