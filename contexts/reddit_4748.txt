I wish I was the dead twin
I want friends. I want a lover. I want some sort of relationship where I feel comfortable. I’m so tired of being alone. I’m so tired of being me. Im tired of being an asshole, a dick, a bitch, a monster. I’m tired of being like my father. Hearing the hate CONSTANTLY can be overwhelming sometimes. I never saw myself as being mean, but I guess it’s just in my DNA. And for that reason, I don’t think I can ever truly love myself.  I feel like I can’t breathe. Like everything I say or do is immediately going to be shut down and served right back at me. I’m never good enough anymore, I’m not funny anymore, I’m not happy anymore. I think at this point I’ve been told so much that I’m awful, I’ve come to believe it. I now know that I was never good enough to begin with. That I am a disappointment, a loser, a bitch, and the most notable, an empty bottomless pit of regret. I’m sorry that I’ve proven you wrong. I’m sorry that I didn’t turn out right, or even just the way you wanted. I feel like a fraud. Me existing is wrong, I shouldn’t be here. I should’ve been the miscarriage. I should’ve been the one! It’s all fucked somehow. Why am I here if I’m meant to be alone?
