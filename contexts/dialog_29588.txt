DILLINGER: No problem, Master-C. If you've seen one Consumer Electronics Show... What's up?
MCP: It's our friend the boy detective. He's nosing around again.
DILLINGER: Flynn?
MCP: Yes. It felt like Flynn.
DILLINGER: He's still looking for that old file... can't you just appropriate it?
MCP: I would if I could find it. it's stashed somewhere off in the system ... out of my range. Meanwhile...
DILLINGER: Meanwhile, he might find it.
MCP: I'm afraid so. I spotted him this time and kicked him out, but he's getting trickier all the time.
DILLINGER: I think we'd better shut off all access till we can find that file. Just to be safe.
MCP: There's a 68.71 percent chance you're right.
DILLINGER: Cute.
MCP: End of line.
