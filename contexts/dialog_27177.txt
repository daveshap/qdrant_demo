PENDERGAST: What happened?
MARGO: Its eyesight is worse than I thought. It couldn't see us. And it couldn't smell us through the glass.
PENDERGAST: It didn't want the fibers. What does that mean?
MARGO: I think... it means it's full.
PENDERGAST: Then it won't go after the others?
MARGO: No. It's still hunting, but not for the hormones.
PENDERGAST: For what?
MARGO: I think... for the pleasure of the kill.
