Layoff or Severance package?
So a friend of mine is facing a layoff sooner or later. Writing is on the wall. Industry is in decline, layoffs every year, consolidation of departments from multiple sites in to a downsized departments servicing multiple sites, declining sales, upper management now sacrificing some middle management positions. Friend has been pretty safe due to multiple years of experience with the company in key positions. 

So to quote Shakespeare, "To take severance or not to take severance. That is the question."

Maximum severance is 20 weeks which he will cap out at so this is significant. OR should he brush off the old resume and start hitting the bricks? I will say that it is my opinion that this fellow is old school experienced. About nothing phases him about his line of work and he is good at it. However, the job market in this area for these positions is drying up so he will probably get hired but it will not be for what he is worth. Think about the movie "The Intern". He reminds me of DeNiro's character in this movie.

So what should I counsel him in doing? Hold out making more and possibly take a nice fat severance or cut your losses (and the current job frustrations) and just move on?
