If you have a mortgage, interest rates are super low right now.
This is not for the 'help i have $30 to get til payday' crowd, sorry. This is for the 'I don't fit in a r/personalfinance because if I see one more post about some 20-something in a loft in NYC that their parents pay for getting $50k as a gift from a random relative I'm going to come through the computer screen shrieking' crowd.  

If you're broke with a mortgage (like me) now is a good time to call up your mortgage people and ask about refinancing your loan - if you've had it for longer than a year and you have decent credit, the rates are really good right now and most of the (re)closing costs can get rolled into the new mortgage and still save you a pretty substantial amount of money over the long term. 

Doesn't hurt to call and check, and then pick another reputable bank or credit union and call and check there too and leverage them against each other to see if you can wriggle an extra percentage point off of them with some healthy competition.  

Just an FYI if anyone has a crappy mortgage rate they'd like to try and get out from under.
