Problem Claiming miles (Star Alliance) operated by SK I had a roundtrip flight with Lufthansa to US via Frankfurt. This was four flights in total. So far I managed to claim all my miles from the first 3 flights however the final flight from FRA to ARN was impossible to claim, as there are some technical problems with the ticket.1) I am trying to add the miles into my A3 *A account.<br>2) The segment from FRA to ARN was operated by SAS (although the ticket was issued by LH).<br>3) My ticket number is 220 XXXXXXXXX ie typical for LH.It seems to me that A3 system that counts the miles is confused by this situation. Do you know how should I properly claim this segment's miles through A3? Any Ideas? Should I put into A3 system that flight was by SK and ticket number 220 XXXX? This is very confusing!
