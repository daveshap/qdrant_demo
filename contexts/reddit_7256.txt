What's it like working at a thrift store?
Young guy here, I've always worked construction after graduating HS. Never worked retail or any other kind of job. Have 80 hours of community service I need to do starting tomorrow. I assume it's pretty straight forward, unloading donations etc just wanted to know what people's experiences have been like.
