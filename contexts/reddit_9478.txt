If you live near a Petco or other big pet store, a lot of them participate in weekly or monthly affordable vet services for dogs and cats.
I was in a hurry and generally panic about my dog’s health (dog mom problems :p)  and paid $300 last May for my dog’s regular vaccines from my usual vet.... his heart worm test was due this month so I finally decided to check out Petco’s Vetco . It was $39 for a heart worm test and three other tick-borne illnesses. 

For fun I checked the price of vaccinations and I could have saved over $200 last May if I just went to Petco. Their price for the vaccines my dog received last year is $69. They also do microchipping for $20. 

These are HUGE savings for a healthy pet!! ❤️
