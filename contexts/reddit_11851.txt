Maybe I'm a bit depressed.
I'm in high school right now, don't really have friends since I think I look to angry or cold to be approachable. Now I'm on winter break and have nothing too much time so it's bothering me a bit. My sleep schedule is wack now since I'm preparing for a show my friends and I are preparing for school so I fall asleep late, wake up early feel sleepy and fall asleep then can't sleep until later. I've been playing video games and that takes my mind off of it but I still feel uneasy. This usually happens on every winter break but something feels different about this time.
