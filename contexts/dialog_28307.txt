SULLY: Healy you dog!
HEALY: Fucking Sully! Look at you!
SULLY: You hot shit. Ya look fuckin' pisser.
SULLY: Here's the info you asked for.
HEALY: Thanks.
SULLY: You should thank me -- that girl was not easy to find. What'd she scam you out of-some insurance dough?
HEALY: Nah, some guy threw me a few bucks to track down his high school girlfriend.
SULLY: Stalker, huh?
HEALY: Big time.
HEALY: Very nice.
SULLY: I'm doing okay. I gotta get ready for work.
HEALY: Okay? With this pad, the killer wheels? Looks like you really cleaned up your act.
SULLY: What can I tell you? It's a healthier lifestyle down here, and it's easier to succeed when your head's clear. Those guys I worked with back in Boston, they were a bad influence.
HEALY: Fuckin' animals. Hey, what do you say we go grab a couple drinks.
SULLY: Not for me, buddy. I don't drink anymore.
HEALY: Yeah, and you don't drink any less, right?
