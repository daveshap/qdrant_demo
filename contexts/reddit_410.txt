How do I tell my mom to stop asking about times?
whenever i have to do homework or anything time consuming, my mom always asks how long it will take, how much longer, etc. 

it's really grating on my nerves and i keep telling her "i don't know" because i really don't. it could take 30 minutes to 5 hours honestly. whenever i tell her i don't know, she always replies with "that's not good enough, tell me a time. guess." but if i tell her it will take an hour and it takes more than that, she gets really upset. or if i say something like 4 hours (which is way in the realm of possibility with the classes i'm taking) she also gets upset because she says that's too long. 

it's almost become a cat and mouse game like this, and i'm so tired of it. i tried talking to her about it but she dismissed it and keeps doing it. 

what should i do??
