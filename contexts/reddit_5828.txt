Conflicted about choosing a college major that would help me get a job
So I'm a second year in college and i still dont know what to major in (dont judge me) because I really am terrified of choosing the wrong major and struggling to find a job in the future, especially abroad since I really want to live abroad. 

I considered so many majors such as communication, graphic design, psychology, and environmental science (I know my interests are varied). but I swear whenever I read about them, everything I hear is contradictory, someone would say that it has great job prospects, but then another person would say otherwise. 

Honestly, all the advice I see about choosing your major is always contradictory, some people say "choose your passion" and then another person would emphasize how that is a bad decision, some people say that all that matters is getting a "hard" skill like tech, and heck most of reddit would just say "do STEM" or whatever. 

Heck some people even say that your college major doesn't matter, while others say that it absolutely does.

How the heck do I figure out the truth?
