What is the purpose of PovertyFinance?
I joined /r/PovertyFinance hoping to 1) discover things that are useful for people in poverty and 2) enjoy hearing/sharing stories of the struggle and successes of people in poverty for encouragement/wisdom.

Seems the only things that make the front page are images of paid off student loans and images of credit scores. In general, these things aren’t very helpful. Most people can’t even implement the methods in such posts... e.g., get a job paying 80k/year, live with parents, etc... because they are unattainable for most.

I would rather someone post about how to find ways to save money or stay sane... For example, my wife and I saved tons of money buying baby things on the Facebook marketplace. I highly recommend over Craigslist.

Edit: As I keep mentioning in the comments (and pointed out above), people should post their successes. We want to see people escape poverty, but a post of an image of bank account, paid off debt, credit score, etc... is useless without the story. Most often, the story goes untold along with these type of posts.
