UNCLE ELROY: Wet your eyes, boy. Stay in there for about 20 minutes.
DAY-DAY: 20 minutes?
UNCLE ELROY: Yeah, 20 minutes. Trust me. I've been pepper sprayed nine times. 20 minutes.
UNCLE ELROY: Yeah, you gotta have a little money to live out here, Craig. I never thought I'd be the kinda nigga to move to the suburbs. But as soon as I got my check, I was gone. Paid 230 thousand dollars cash on this house.
CRAIG: You paid cash?
UNCLE ELROY: Cash money. They wasn't gonna stick me with no 30-year payment plan. That's for suckas. They got my daddy like that for a Cadillac years ago. I got the only house on the block that's paid for. That's why I'm the king around here.
CRAIG: It's cool, but where's the water?
UNCLE ELROY: Don't need water. We didn't have no pool in the projects...so none of us swim.
CRAIG: Y'all never use it?
UNCLE ELROY: Never... But me and Suga can get real nasty in that Jacuzzi, though.
CRAIG: That's okay, Unc. I can't swim, either.
UNCLE ELROY: Good.
