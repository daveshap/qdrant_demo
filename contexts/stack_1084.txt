Winetricks: Can't locate and install d3dcompiler_43.dll? I have a game running on Lutris and I need to install d3dcompiler_43.dll library. However, when I try installing it trough Winetricks, the package is simply not on the list. The only similar package (with a similar name) I see is d3dcompiler_47.dll, however, the game doesn't run with this one. My Wine version is 3.18. I am pretty sure the package used to be there, but I don't remember what wine version I used. Do you know how to install it without Winetricks? Or if I should I use another wine version instead in order to install it?
