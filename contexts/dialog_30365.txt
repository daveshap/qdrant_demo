LIZ: This is ridiculous.
FISHER: Government cutbacks.
LIZ: Why can't we do it through the mail?
FISHER: We missed the deadline.
LIZ: Can't we do it on the phone?
FISHER: I don't think so.
LIZ: Why is this Kid staring at me?
FISHER: I'm not sure.
LIZ: Did you send in all of the deposit checks?
FISHER: I think so.
LIZ: What do you mean, you think so?
FISHER: I sent a lot of checks, I'm not sure what all of them are.
LIZ: The wedding cake check?
FISHER: Sent it.
LIZ: Photographer?
FISHER: Sent it.
LIZ: Florist?
FISHER: Yup.
LIZ: Caterer?
FISHER: Yes.
LIZ: Hotel for my parents, the tent, the band, the Judge...
FISHER: I think I forgot the tent.
LIZ: You forgot the tent?
FISHER: I think so.
LIZ: Why?
FISHER: Why what?
LIZ: Why did you forget the tent check?
FISHER: I didn't mean to Liz. I'm sorry.
LIZ: You can't play around with these tent people.
FISHER: I'm not playing around. I forgot.
LIZ: What else have you forgot?
FISHER: How could I know what else I forgot?
LIZ: I'm working my ass off here. I've taken care of absolutely everything Keith.
FISHER: Because you wanted to. You wanted this to be your wedding not your parent's.
LIZ: Don't you dare.
FISHER: What?
LIZ: Don't you put this on me. Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it, don't...
FISHER: Stop it. I'm sorry.
LIZ: You know how important this is to my mother. You know that.
FISHER: I'm sorry. I'm sorry I forgot the tent. I don't think I forgot anything else.
LIZ: I bet you didn't forget the bachelor party checks.
FISHER: Are we going to do this again?
LIZ: I'm just saying I bet those checks all found the mailboxes.
FISHER: I wouldn't know.
LIZ: It amazes me how organized you and your little fun bunch can be when it comes time to mobilize to Vegas.
FISHER: They organized this, not me. I have nothing to do with it.
LIZ: Well it's bad timing.
FISHER: How do you figure?
LIZ: Right before the wedding?
FISHER: It's a bachelor party. You sort of have to do it before the wedding.
LIZ: I suppose Boyd is the creative force behind all this.
FISHER: He is.
LIZ: He's a moron.
FISHER: He's my friend. He's not a moron.
LIZ: David Boyd is a big sack of hot gas.
