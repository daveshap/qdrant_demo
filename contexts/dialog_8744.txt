WEIR: That's how the gravity drive works, you see: it focuses the black hole's immense gravitational power to create the gateway. That's how the Event Horizon travels faster than light.
STARCK: I can't believe we built this.
MILLER: It's insane.
WEIR: Insane?" The finest astronauts fought to be posted to this ship. It would take the Lewis and Clark a thousand years to reach our closest star. The Event Horizon could be there in a day..."
MILLER: If it worked.
WEIR: If it worked, yes.
MILLER: I want this room sealed. The Second Containment is off limits.
WEIR: There's no danger. The black hole is contained behind three magnetic fields, it's under control.
MILLER: Your black hole damn near ripped my ship apart. It may have killed one of my men. No one goes near that thing.
