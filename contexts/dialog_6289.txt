BIG AL: Hey, Jake... When am I gonna get to play the Inside?
JAKE: Gordo plays the inside. You're the Shill.
BIG AL: Yeah, but come on... All I get to do is cry and get insulted.
JAKE: What are you talking about? You should get a fucking Academy Award for the Shill work you do. We got it down cold, Al. You don't want to jinx it by changing something up, do you?
BIG AL: I'm gonna go get eggrolls. Anyone want eggrolls?
JAKE: What? I can feel you looking at me.
GORDO: That's a lot of cash. He came up with it pretty quick.
JAKE: Probably some investment banker or convertible-bonds-broker-dickhead. Did you see how fast he ran out of here? It's done. He's not coming back.
GORDO: I guess. I gotta drop a dime. Did anybody mess up the hoop?
