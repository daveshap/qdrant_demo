I finally found one
After over a year of online dating on eHarmony, I finally found a guy who wants a second date. And he is easily the most attractive guy I have met up with. He feels out of my league because I am a little overweight. But he says he loves my smile and we seemed to hit it off pretty good...

Just wish me luck on our second date next weekend. We are going to a museum.
