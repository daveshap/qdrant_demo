Today I managed not to look away when a girl made eye contact.
I'm usually very shy and insecure around girls. If one makes eye contact I look down or away immediately especially if I find her cute.

Today though a group of three attractive girls were walking towards me. My eyes met with one of them, I held her gaze for a second or two and she gave me the biggest most beautiful smile! It really made my day and gave me a huge confidence boost.

It made me reconsider what is it that I'm being insecure about? I'm lacking confidence and I don't even know why. Amazing what a simple smile can do!

EDIT: Thanks for the award stranger. I'm glad it cheered someone else up too!
