KITZ: I'll come right to the point, Doctor. Your sending this message all over the world may well be a breach of National Security.
ELLIE: This isn't a person to person call, Mr. Kitz. I don't really think the civilization sending the message intended it just for Americans.
KITZ: I'm saying you might have consulted us; the contents of this message could be extremely sensitive...
ELLIE: You want to classify prime numbers?
DRUMLIN: Mike, because of the Earth's rotation we're only in line with Vega so many hours a day; the only way to get the whole message is to cooperate with other stations. If Dr. Arroway hadn't moved quickly we could have lost key elements.
KITZ: Okay, fine, they've got the primes -- but if you're right about there being another more significant transmission still to come --
ELLIE: -- which we'll also need the network's help to receive and decode!
KITZ: You don't seem to understand that it's your interests I'm trying to protect -- !
