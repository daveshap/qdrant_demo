Stranding \"of\" in subjects - Possible or impossible? ObservationTake a subject that contains an of-phrase (friend of X, president of X, writer of X etc.). Now try to question the element X after of by fronting the corresponding wh-phrase.Often this seems to be completely impossible, as illustrated in (1).<blockquote>  (1) [The friend of the president] has arrived / was fired / fixed my car.<br>  --> ?* Which president has [the friend of _ ] arrived?<br>  --> ?* Which president was [the friend of _ ] fired?<br>  --> ?* Which president did [the friend of _ ] fix my car?</blockquote>But sometimes such fronting seems to be fine, as shown in (2).<blockquote>  (2) [The impeachment of the president] has occurred / was discussed / caused outrage.<br>  --> Which president has [the impeachment of _ ] occured?<br>  --> Which president was [the impeachment of _ ] discussed?<br>  --> Which president did [the impeachment of _ ] cause outrage?</blockquote>And sometimes, such sentences are more acceptable for unaccusatives (arrive, occur, die) and passives (was fired, was discussed, was arrested), than for transitives (fix my car, cause outrage, composed a speech). This is illustrated in (3).<blockquote>  (3) [The writer of the president] has died / was arrested / composed a speech.<br>  --> Which president has [the writer of _ ] died?<br>  --> Which president was [the writer of _ ] arrested?<br>  --> ?* Which president did [the writer of _ ] compose a speech? </blockquote><br>QuestionWhy can you sometimes leave of stranded in the subject and sometimes not?
