RATSO: Joe -- do me one favor -- this is my place, am I wrong? You know, in my own place my name ain't Ratso. I mean it so happens my name is Enrico Salvatore Rizzo.
JOE: Shee-it, man, I can't say all that.
RATSO: Rico then, at least call me Rico in my own goddam place.
JOE: Rico! Rico! Rico! Is that enough? And keep your meat hooks off my radio.
