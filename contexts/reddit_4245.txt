I don't think we have a hookup culture; We have a "everything has to be perfect" culture
There seems to be two camps:

1. I want everything perfect, but I can't find that, but I'm going to keep having one or two dates with tons of people until I'm really bitter and give up.

2. I want everything perfect, but I can't find that, so I'm just going to sleep with people.

People tend to know this, maybe subconsciously. They assume that if you're not in their camp, you must be in the other.

I had a professor recently make a comment about 'hookup culture' that is hurting relationships, and after some thought, I think it's this generation's narcissism and influence from sources more like Disney and maybe a misinterpretation of old concepts of romance and love.
