LOGAN: Why is everybody up at sunrise?
STORM: The sun is setting, Logan. You've been asleep for nineteen hours.
LOGAN: What did she do to me?
STORM: She borrowed your power to save her life. When she touches someone, she absorbs their strengths -- their gifts. In your case -- your ability to heal. That's why she keeps her body covered.
LOGAN: I felt like she almost killed me.
STORM: If she held on any longer she could have.
LOGAN: And you think it helps calling her Rogue?
