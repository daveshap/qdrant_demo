TECHNICIAN: This gun permit was issued to Clark Brandon?
KILLAINE: The card says so, doesn't it?
TECHNICIAN: Brandon handled the money envelope.
KILLAINE: What's the face for, Driscoll?
DRISCOLL: Magruder's conked out. Adrenaline injections, oxygen tent. He may come out of it and he may not. As a source of quick information, we can't forget him.
KILLAINE: We don't need him.
