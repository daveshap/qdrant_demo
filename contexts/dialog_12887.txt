MOLLY: God, how I hate all this scrimping and squalor.
GRACE: I don't mind it. It was harder before the war. Trying to keep up appearances. Now it's patriotic to be poor.
MOLLY: I don't know how you cope, Grace. Three kids, army pay. On your own.
GRACE: You know something, Molly? I like it on my own. I never got used to sharing a bed, not really.
