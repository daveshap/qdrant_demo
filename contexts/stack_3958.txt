Which statistical method/test? I am new to statistics. I want to put the evaluation plan of my research. The research will be in the form of a RCT with 2 groups (Intervention and control). I will be comparing the change of the mean of oral health knowledge before, immediately after, and 6 weeks after the intervention in each group as well as between both groups?Which statistical test will be appropriate?
