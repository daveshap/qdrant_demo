EVELYN: You told me you found it on a dig down in Thebes!
JONATHAN: I was mistaken.
EVELYN: You lied to me!
JONATHAN: I lie to everybody, what makes you so special?
EVELYN: I'm your sister.
JONATHAN: That just makes you more gullible.
EVELYN: You stole it from a drunk at the local Casbah?!
JONATHAN: Picked his pocket, actually.
EVELYN: And what is he in prison for?
WARDEN: I did not know, so when I heard you were coming, I asked him that myself.
EVELYN: And what did he say?
WARDEN: He said... he was just looking for a good time.
EVELYN: But he's just a filthy criminal?
JONATHAN: Way to go, Evy.
O'CONNELL: So who's the broad?
EVELYN: Broad?!
JONATHAN: She's my sister, actually.
O'CONNELL: Yeah? Well,... I'm sure she's not a total loss.
