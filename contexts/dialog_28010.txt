LOUISE: That J.D. kid is a little shit.
THELMA: What.
LOUISE: How'd they find out we're going to Mexico, Thelma, how they know that?
THELMA: I... I...
LOUISE: You told that thievin' little shit where we were goin'?!
THELMA: I just told him if he ever gets to Mexico to look us up. I asked him not to tell. I didn't think he would tell anybody.
LOUISE: Why not?! What's he got to lose? Other than my life's savings, that is. Shit!
