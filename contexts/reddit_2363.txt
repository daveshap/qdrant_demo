Ranking t20s based on the distance to the closest Chick Fil A
Everyone has their own metrics for judging how good a school is, maybe small class size makes a school more attractive, maybe it's a great grad school, or maybe it's an insane ratio of women to men students (I'm looking at you, American!) In any case, everyone has a different perspective on what makes a college truly great, and everyone ranks colleges differently. It is because of this discontinuity that I am pleased to announce: 

The A2C Ranking list of US News T20s and A Couple of Other Schools I Liked Based on their Proximity relative to Chick Fil A According to Google Maps (Or the A2CRLOUST20AACOOSILBOTPROCFAATGM for short). It is my hope that this life In this list will finally provide us with a stable metric on what ranking colleges really are. I've ranked the us news top 20 undergrad schools, along with some other schools I thought were cool. The results were as follows:

# #2: UVA, with a distance of 0.2 miles to the nearest chick fil a, it will take you approximately 5 minutes to walk there. Definitely worth it, Chick-Fil-As in the south are always incredible. Kind staff, good food, and an all-around great atmosphere, I've never been but I'm going to assume that it is amazing because it is a Chick Fil A.
# #3-5: Duke, Caltech, and William and Mary, with a distance of 0.3 miles to the nearest Chick Fil A. Big shoutouts to these schools for having super close chick fil as that you can easily walk to under the cover of buildings, so if it's raining or something you can get there while staying relatively dry. 
# #6: Georgetown. Georgetown also has a distance of 0.3 miles, but it appears to be an on campus chick fil a, making it worse than normal. No good thing has ever come from an on-campus chick fil a but you gotta give them credit for trying. Nice job georgetown!
Keep in mind the top 6 all take appoximately 6 minutes to get to from the center of campus as described by google maps
# #7: Rice, with a distance of 0.6 miles, taking approximately 15 minutes to get there.
# #8-11: UPenn, American, Notre Dame, and Vanderbilt. Each is approximately 0.7 miles away from Chick Fil a, and it will take an estimated 15 minutes to walk there.
# #12: Washingotn University in St. Louis. Washington is special because you need to cut across a park to get to the Chick Fil A, which is nice and calm. It takes about an hour to walk the 2.6 miles required to get there, but it looks like a nice walk, and I wouldn't mind strolling by on a sunny day on my way to the chick fil a. Yay. Alliteration.
# #13: Johns Hopkins, which takes 1 hour to travel the 3 miles required to get there. Johns Hopkins was a pain to find because searching "chick fil a near to johns hopkins" brought me to some random road like 8 hours outside of the city so I had to find chick fil a myself by searching for chick fil as in baltimore.
# #14 Emory University, which takes 1 hour to travel the 3 miles required.
# #15: Northwestern. 3.7 miles. 1.16 hours. Keep in mind when I type like "1.16 hours" that just means 1hour 16 minutes, im just too lazy to type it all out correctly
# #16 Brown, 4.8 miles, 1.37 hours
# #17 Columbia, 5.8 miles, 2 hours. How are there not more chick fil a in new york city. That's baffling to me. glad i didn't apply
# #18 Yale, 5.9 miles, 2 hours. 
# #19 UMich 6.6 miles, 2.12 hours. However, the chick fil a near UMich is an Express Chick Fil A in another university, so not only is it far away, but it's probably really bad too. 0/10 would not recommend applying to UMich. (EDIT: APPARENTLY this chick fil a is fine. nice.)
# #20 UC Hicago: 7.3 miles. 2.26 hours. I'm not gonna recommend you walk alone through Chicago at night just cuz ur hungry, but for Chick Fil A it might be worth it.

# #21 Stanford: 7.8 miles, 2.44 hours
# #22-23: Harvard and MIT, 8.8 miless, 3 hours
# #24: Princeton: 12.7 miles, 4.4 hours away. Very sad!


And now, our special mentions. You probably noticed that #1 was missing. This is due to just how incredibly small the distance is. You could practically crawl to chick fil a here, and it would still only take you about 5 minutes. With that introduction, I present to you:

# #1 UCLA! UCLA absolutely demolishes the competition with a distance of **EIGHTY FIVE FEET!!1** it would take you approximately **ONE MINUTE** to walk to chick fil a from UCLA, making it our top school in the A2CRLOUST20AACOOSILBOTPROCFAATGM ranking system. 

Now, for sadder news. Coming in at last place, we have Cornell and Dartmouth. 

# #24-25 Cornell: 59.4 miles, and 19 hours. Even worse is Dartmouth, with 91 miles and 34 hours walking speed. I could walk to Baltimore from my home in Virginia before I could walk to a chick fil a from dartmouth or Cornell. honestly quite shameful. very displeased.


In conclusion. UCLA absolutely owns the competition with an incredible performance, but lots of schools located in the Southeast United States give UCLA a run for it's money. Schools up north or on the west coast traditionally performed very poorly, probably because they are more liberal and hate chick fil a for some reason. buncha nerds tbh. if you want my stats here is the link to my epic spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M59TKDfW6cOLsUXsI_LvhMf2MDa51tJdzzQUZStnErg/edit?usp=sharing

if you have any questions or comments or especially corrections feel free to reply below and ill do my best to ignore you because im not editing this it was such a pain to make and im not doin it again



# extra schools (i forgot the word for like runner ups or extra but whtaever)

Arizona State University (i think thats what ASU is idk): Direct quote from carlyc999 below: "The on campus one is amazingly fast to the point where sometimes your order will be ready before you finish paying" like thats hype, u get ur food and u get out, probably really good food too, especially for an on campus location. seems like a cool place

Georgia TEch: theres one like 5 minutes away and it is in the same city that CFA is headquartered in, just drive a little bit and you get to take a tour of the HQ. 

Christian universities: idk how good they are but almost all of them have chick fil as either on campus or like 5 feet away. symbiotic relationship, they feed off of each other
