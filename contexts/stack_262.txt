macOS High Sierra Turkish Keyboard Issue I started to use a Mac mini with Turkish keyboard. However, macOS High Sierra has only Turkish Q and Turkish Q Legacy keyboard options. If I remember correctly almost one year ago I was using a MacBook in a virtual machine and when I chose to Turkish QWERTY PC option, every key was working as I expected. This option was removed now I think. And some keys and combination of keys don't work or represent totally different charters or symbols.I tried to change my location but it didn't help me at all.How can I fix this annoying issue?
