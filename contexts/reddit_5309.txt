How do you deal with a nosy/ weird co-worker?
I sit by a very nosy co-worker who easing dropping in all my conversation and even takes time out his day to stare at my screen. Also, he doesn't seem to remember a lot of things about work and is always asking questions again and again. Instead of agreeing with the process, he wants to argue about the process. He has no manners, he will cough without covering his mouth (worst when you come to work with a terrible flu and refuse to take a sick day), brings fish into work, squeak his mouth because something is stuck in his mouth and chew with his mouth open.  Last but not the least, he has a big staring problem, where he will stand and stare at me or my other co-workers for a long time.

I have some of the problems to mentioned it to my manager nothing has improved.
