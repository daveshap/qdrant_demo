How to install cx_freeze 5.0.2 for python 3.5.2? I am running ubuntu 16. I have both python 2.7 and 3.5 installed. I want to install cx_freeze latest version for python3. I downloaded the package from their website but couldn't run the setup.py file as it always gave me errors. Also i have installed pip3, but it still doesn't work for me. all the answers online are for older version of cx_freeze so a fresh answer for the new version will be helpful.
