The struggles I see on this site confirm that, for the most parts, looks is the most important factor
This is based on what I have observed, not my own "theories" etc.

The "venting" posts most commonly seen on here fall into a few catagories:

&#x200B;

"I'm a guy, but I can't even get  a match, much less a date"

"I'm a girl, and there is this HOT guy, but he is emotionally unavailable"

"I'm a pretty attractive guy, and I went on a date with girl and we hooked up, she invited me back, and dated for a little bit but she ghosted me"

"I'm a girl, why does it feel like every guy just wants sex? when I go on dates with men they always get sexual"

&#x200B;

Can anyone see a common denominator here? it seems as though a lot of women (at least on here) are going after men who are charming and "hot", and confused when they don't want to commit to them. also, there are so many women stating that men "just want sex". Yet, I know that a lot of men on here and in real life actually want a relationship. why aren't women matching with these men? it doesn't add up.  On the flip side, most men seem to struggle with even get matches.

Sure, there is the occasional women who can't get a match. or the story of a guy who won over a girl with his personality, but I feel like this are more the exception than the rule. 

from my personal experience, my success skyrocketed when I decided to improve my looks. and by skyrocked it just means I'm able to go on a date with a women I'm interested in at least once a week - doesn't mean things work out at all, in fact that usually don't. why is this the case? Ive always been the same person/etc.  has dating really become this shallow? from my standpoint, If I'm at least somewhat attracted to you (physically), and you can hold a conversation, I'll give you a shot to see if there is additional chemistry. but it seems like a lot  people will chase "hot" people continously, despite other personality flaws.
