ED: I knew about it. Big Dave told me about it, and the spot he was putting himself in by getting the money.
RIEDENSCHNEIDER: Terrific. Your husband backs you up. That's terrific.
RIEDENSCHNEIDER: ...You've gotta give me something to work with. Freddy Riedenschneider is good, but he's not a magician. He can't just wave his little wand in the air and make a plausible defense materialize. Look. Look at what the other side is gonna run at us. They got the company books, prepared by you--*cooked* by you--that's Motive. They got a murder scene *you* had access to. That's Opportunity. They got that little trimmer thing he was stabbed in the throat with--a *dame's* weapon--
ED: It was Big Dave's.
RIEDENSCHNEIDER: --don't interrupt me--that's Means. They got a fine upstanding pillar of the business community as a victim, and then they got *you*, a disgruntled number-juggling underling who on the day in question was drunk as a skunk and whose alibi for the time in question is being passed out at home, alone.
ED: *I* was with her.
