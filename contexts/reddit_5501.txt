I'm overqualified and I have questions regarding omitting my master's degree from my resume. How should I reframe my work experience?
I am a licensed psychotherapist who is applying for a non-therapy job that only requires a bachelor's degree. I've decided to omit my social work license and master's degree from this resume. However, my past 3 years of work experience only involve doing psychotherapy.

I've managed to reframe my therapy jobs to properly suit the position I want. However, my two internships during grad school were purely psychotherapy, and it would border on dishonest to describe them as anything otherwise. Thus, I'm left with a dilemma:

1. Omit the internships and have a two-year gap on my resume. I could explain this away by saying that I was in grad school. They may ask, however, why then I didn't include my master's on my resume.

2. Include the internships. But then again, they may ask why I didn't include my master's on my resume and it might appear that I failed to graduate.

Both options would likely be perceived as hiding something and being overqualified for the job (which I am, but I desperately need it right now). Any suggestions on what I should do? Thank you.

**Update: After seeing the responses, I'll go ahead and put my master's back in. Thank you all.**
