IGOR: You're sure you know what you're doing?
FREDDY: Yes! It's all written down in the notes. Tie off the kites and come down!
IGOR: Yes, master. Just don't turn on any radios.
FREDDY: Soon, all the electrical secrets of Heaven shall be mine.
INGA: Oh, Frederick... you're not only a great doctor, you're a great... you're almost a...
FREDDY: A god?
INGA: Yes!
FREDDY: I know.
IGOR: You'd better hurry -- I think it's going to rain.
FREDDY: All right... elevate me!
INGA: Right here?
FREDDY: Raise the platform, hurry!
INGA: Oh! Yes, Doctor.
FREDDY: The ancient masters promised impossibilities and performed nothing. We shall penetrate into the recesses of nature. We shall ascend into the Heavens. We shall command the thunders of Heaven, mimic the earthquake and even mock the invisible world with its own shadows.
IGOR: Tonight?
FREDDY: Yes! When I give the word -- throw the first switch!
IGOR: You've got it, master.
