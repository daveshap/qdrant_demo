MARYLIN: Forgery and Fraud?
RUTH: You used his credit card.
MARYLIN: He told me to -- he said he wanted me to --
RUTH: Quite a little shopping spree. How do you spend six figures in less than six hours? Oh, never mind I've seen it before. I've seen everything.
MARYLIN: Do you think he set me up? Do you think that was his intention?
RUTH: Like I know his intention? Or yours for that matter? I should join Sam. I'm too old for this bullshit.
MARYLIN: He never even asked. He just assumed --
RUTH: He was right, wasn't he?
MARYLIN: So. Now what?
RUTH: Now? Well, Marylin, now you cut a deal or find out how Jean Harris made it work for her.
MILES: Well. Well. Well. Look who made bail!
MARYLIN: May I come in?
MILES: I don't know. Maybe I should grab my mace. I'm a civil attorney. I have little experience with the criminal mind.""
MARYLIN: I'd just like to pick up a few of my things
MILES: I don't believe you have things.""
MARYLIN: On the contrary. We're married and we have no pre-nup, so a case could be made that everything in here is mine.
MARYLIN: Comfy!
MILES: What do you want?
MARYLIN: I want to nail you ass.
MILES: Are you threatening me, because I'm sure that's a violation of the terms of your bail.
MARYLIN: I'm reporting you to the IRS.
MILES: The IRS? They owe me. I'm expecting a refund.
MILES: I'm clean with the IRS. I've reported every dollar I've ever made. Try again, girlfriend.
MARYLIN: I'm not talking about dollars, studmuffin. I'm talking about --
MARYLIN: STUFF. Got a light?
MILES: What kind of stuff?""
MARYLIN: Arty Farty stuff. Lithographs and pre Castro Cubans. Watches and mileage on private jets. Stuff, Miles. Stuff you get from grateful clients.
MILES: Those are gifts.
MARYLIN: Salary. Unreported income. By the way, what time IS it on Bellagio Road?
MILES: You can't prove anything.
MARYLIN: I don't have to. That's what the IRS guys do. And they do it with great zeal. See, they work at these tortuous civil service jobs, and when five hundred dollar an hour boys like you take their trade out in luxury goodies, these saps feel.. well, they feel like saps. And they feel bitter and they feel vengeful and they feel WRATH. What is this? A Romeo and Julieta?
MILES: You're out of your league, Marylin. Rexroth was a primate. I'm a professional.
MARYLIN: I know. So am I, right? And so is Agent Wilson of the Internal Revenue Service. He's a dedicated, underpaid graduate of Southwestern University -- very tenacious, and never more so than when he's dealing with an unscrupulous colleague. I think it's only fair to warn you: I'm going to file an action, Miles. And after a decent interval I plan to have Ruth seek an injunction that will forbid your approach within 500 feet of my house.
MILES: Meaning my house.
MARYLIN: I believe the residence will be part of the settlement.
MILES: Did our marriage ever mean anything to you?
MARYLIN: Drop the bogus forgery charge and I'll forget about your generous friends slash clients.
MILES: That's blackmail.
MARYLIN: That's marriage.
