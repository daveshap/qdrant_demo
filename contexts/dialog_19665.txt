LEON: What's new?
KOPALSKI: Leon, Leonitchka, she is not going to negotiate! She is going to fight that injunction. She's going to make a precedent of it!
IRANOFF: She says she won't be intimidated by parasites. She called the Duchess a blood-sucking aristocrat and a blackmailer.
LEON: What did she say about me?
IRANOFF: I think she covered you with the parasites.
BULJANOFF: And Leonitchka! What she said about us...!
IRANOFF: And they might believe her in Moscow.
BULJANOFF: What do you mean they might -- they will!
KOPALSKI: We don't blame you, Leon, but when we came from Russia we believed in simplicity...
IRANOFF: We avoided luxury and extravagance and today... well, if you were to offer us a glass of champagne, we wouldn't say no.
LEON: Well, boys, I'd like to help you but what can I do? Yesterday I waited six hours in the lobby!
KOPALSKI: She doesn't leave her room! She has been locked in for the last two days with lawyers and law books!
LEON: All right, then make an appointment with her so I can see her!
KOPALSKI: We can't... but you are so ingenious, Leon...
IRANOFF: You found your way to us and we weren't easy to reach, were we?
LEON: No, no.
BULJANOFF: Didn't we put up a strong resistance?
LEON: Oh, yes, yes.
KOPALSKI: You must help us, Leon... if you don't win her over we're on our way to Siberia!
BULJANOFF: Or it might be the firing squad!
KOPALSKI: Or we can't go back to Russia!
