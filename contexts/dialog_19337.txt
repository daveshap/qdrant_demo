JOSIE: Maybe because we're not supposed to be having sex with bananas.
TRACY: You know what, though? I feel like I'm really ready to do it. To have sex for the first time.
JOSIE: Wow. That's big. I mean sex is a really big deal. You shouldn't do it until you know you've found the right person.
JOSIE: You know, Adele penguins pick one mate. They spend their whole life looking for that one other penguin and when they find it, they know. That's the penguin they stay with for the rest of their lives.
TRACY: But I'm not a penguin.
