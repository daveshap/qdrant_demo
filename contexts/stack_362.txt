Buying a mac pro (2013) overseas this is probably a very dumb question but I would just like to clarify...I live in New Zealand, and looking to buy a Trashcan/Mac pro from Ebay, as it is a lot cheaper (including duty/tax) than buying one here on a similar second hand website...My only question is can I simply plug in the relevant power supply to the mac pro and use it here? I've tried to google it but I keep getting stuff about macbook pro adaptors, and not much about the mac pro cable. Although I did see some references to Apple having an international power supply or something.Anyway, any clarification would be super helpful. Thanks..
