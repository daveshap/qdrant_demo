BECKER: Who are you?
STARKS: I think you know. Your eyes say you do.
BECKER: [Beat] You're his son?
STARKS: No. I'm not his son. I'm him. [Beat] What? You look like you've seen a ghost. You can come here and touch me, old man. I'm the real thing.
BECKER: How...how are you here?
BECKER: You died, Starks. Years ago, in the hospital.
STARKS: I know. [Beat] You killed me, didn't you?
BECKER: No. I didn't. I swear I didn't. I probably helped push you to kill yourself, but I didn't do it.
STARKS: I didn't kill myself. I died from a blow to the head. How'd it happen? I have to know.
BECKER: I don't know how you died. The last time I put you in the Jacket was just after you told me you remembered killing that police officer...
STARKS: I didn't say I remembered killing him. I just repeated some words to get myself back in there.
BECKER: I know. [Beat] I knew that when you came out.
STARKS: How?
BECKER: Because...because you came out and said something you couldn't have possibly have known. You came back and repeated three names...
BECKER: Of people like you. People I was just trying to help. They couldn't get worse so I thought, with medication, they might get...
STARKS: Medication? What kind of meds do you chase with nights in a cadaver drawer?
BECKER: It was part of the treatment I intended...I didn't know what the effects would be...
STARKS: So, what, you guinea pig sick people to find out?
BECKER: The three of you weren't regular patients. You were criminals that ended up at Alpine Grove.
STARKS: No, we were patients.
