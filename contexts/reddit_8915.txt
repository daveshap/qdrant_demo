What are the benefits and dangers of Nationalism in the US?
[Nationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism) is considered a bad word in many parts of the world due to past events such as the [German Nazi Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Party) and nationalism leading to the [Italian Fascist Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Fascist_Party) and [Japanese Militarism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_militarism) that [contributed to the second world war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causes_of_World_War_II).

Many people consider nationalism to be [xenophobic and hate filled](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/08/the-guardian-view-on-hungarys-election-europe-faces-a-grassroots-fight), in countries such as [Saudi Arabia](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/06/saudi-arabia-nationalism-driving-ban-salman/561845/), nationalism is thought to be a reason behind the silencing of opposing view points, including the most recent [death of a journalist](https://thinkprogress.org/saudi-arabia-media-narratives-khashoggi-killing-absolve-kingdom-7d54297090bc/).

On the flip side, such groups as the [Scottish National Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Party) are advocating for independence from Britain to rejoin the EU in the wake of Brexit.  Others have [claimed things](https://foreignpolicy.com/2009/10/08/is-nationalism-good-for-you/) such as lower corruption, wealthier economies, and fostering a concern for other citizens.

With Donald Trump recently [declaring himself a nationalist](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-declares-himself-a-nationalist-while-stumping-for-ted-cruz-2018-10), what are the potential benefits and dangers of a revitalized nationalist movement in the United States?  Especially given the number of white nationalist groups that support the current administration, such as those at the [Unite the Right rally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unite_the_Right_rally).  Does the form of nationalism that Donald Trump supports capture the benefits of a nationalist society?

And further, how do the ideas of Nationalism compare with the ["traditional" viewpoints of the GOP party](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/2012-republican-party-platform), such as [Federalism](https://reason.com/blog/2017/02/23/do-conservatives-still-care-about-federa) and [Free Trade](https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/reagan-embraced-free-trade-immigration)? And is that shift to the benefit of the Republican Party and/or the United States?
