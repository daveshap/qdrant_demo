ZACH: Look, Miss. I know you're still upset about that incident in Chicago, but understand, this is a cut throat business. We don't have time to play nursemaid to every single Tom Dick and Harry.
SAUNDRA: Maybe we should make the time. Especially considering the sixteen million dollars we have set aside expressly to settle law suits from these very events.
