MITCH: I only know we've got to drive them away from town -- before they drive us away.
SHOLES: How?
MITCH: Mrs. Bundy, you said something about Santa Cruz. About seagulls getting lost in the fog, and heading in for the lights.
DEKE: We don't have any fog this time of year, Mitch.
MITCH: We'll make our own fog.
SHOLES: How do you plan to do that?
MITCH: With smoke.
MALONE: There's an ordinance against burning anything in this town, unless it's...
MITCH: We'll use smoke pots. Like the Army uses.
DEKE: What good'll that do? Smoke's as bad as birds.
MRS. BUNDY: Birds are not bad!
SHOLES: How can we go on living here if we blanket the town with smoke?
MITCH: Can we go on living here otherwise?
