VALENTINE: I mean, Gordon must weigh a good four hundred pounds.
AVERY: Heavier than that now. But are there any drugs in that stomach to back up your story.
VALENTINE: As it happens. I didn't make that part up.
AVERY: And where is this guest? Don't they want to interview him.
VALENTINE: I don't know everyone here. He was so traumatized he split. Maybe he was Gordon's <u>pusher</u>.
VALENTINE: Where do <u>you</u> think he is, Mike.
AVERY: We'll find him.
VALENTINE: No. I mean. Not even your people should be involved. Right? It's too close now.
AVERY: You could use a few of my prime shitkickers up here.
VALENTINE: You think I'm staying?
AVERY: There's already gonna be talk about how people close to you keep falling into canyons.
VALENTINE: Well, can we make it one more. Nowhere the fuck near me.
