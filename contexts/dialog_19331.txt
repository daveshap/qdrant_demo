JOSIE: Are you--scared?
SAM: I'm gonna tell you something here, and I hope it doesn't undermine my position as an authority figure. I'm a little afraid of heights.
JOSIE: You're afraid of the Ferris wheel.
SAM: Actually, it's more the plunging head first into the crowd part that gets me.
JOSIE: Oh right. The Spiderman incident.
SAM: You remember that story?
JOSIE: Of course. I remember everything from your class.
SAM: Yoooooow.
JOSIE: Don't look down!
