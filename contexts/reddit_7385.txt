I am just incapable of finding words at this point. < Rant about grandiloquence in the social sciences >
I don’t know if anyone who studies in social sciences/humanities experiences this but I’m truly getting fed up with my field. Anthropology is really getting to me, my passion for this subject is slowly deteriorating, not that it was necessarily strong to begin with. The overuse of academic jargon is really starting to annoy me. I am completely used to academic jargon at this point so it’s not even that I can’t understand it, but it is so unnecessary half the time and makes it so inaccessible to the average person. My degree is taught in English at a Flemish University and I feel so bad for the Flemish students who have to read this sh* t in their second language. English is my first language and sometimes reading these assignments just confuse the living hell out of me. Why do I need to reference a dictionary for half the words on a page? Why use some of these words in lieu of a simpler one that conveys the exact same meaning? Whenever I try to write any work to be submitted why am I struggling to find words to properly convey my thoughts? Maybe it’s because my mind is filled with all these f***ing niche words that no one outside (or inside) of this field uses or knows what it means. I really feel like my progression is being stunted at this point. This is ridiculous!
