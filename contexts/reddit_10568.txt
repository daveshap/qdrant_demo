Update
I posted here recently about being homeless and sleeping under a bridge in Canada. Due to everyone's help and kind words, I'm in a shelter now hoping to get back on my feet in an actual home asap. Thank you very much to everyone who helped me this far! Bit nervous so pray everything goes smoothly
