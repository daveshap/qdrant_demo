BABE: I've often thought about going back.
LONGFELLOW: You have?
BABE: Oh, yes. I used to have a lot of fun there when I was a little girl. I used to love to go fishing with my father. That's funny. He was a lot like you, my father was. Talked like you, too. Sometimes he'd let me hold the line while he smoked - and we'd just sit there for hours. And after awhile, for no reason, I'd go over and kiss him and sit in his lap. He never said very much but once I remember him saying: No matter what happens
LONGFELLOW: He sounds like a person worth while knowing.
BABE: He played in the town band, too.
LONGFELLOW: He did? I play the tubaâ€”
BABE: Yeah, I know.
LONGFELLOW: What did he play?
BABE: The drums. He taught me to play some.
LONGFELLOW: He did?
BABE: Yes. I can do Swanee River." Would you like to hear me?"
LONGFELLOW: Sure!
BABE: Oh, I suppose you could do better.
LONGFELLOW: Sure. I can sing Humoresque.""
BABE: Humoresque"? I'll bet you don't even know how it goes."
LONGFELLOW: Sure. Look! You sing it over again, and I'll do Humoresque" with you."
BABE: It had better be good.
BOB: I wonder if they'd want to make it a quartet.
FRANK: Shhh!
