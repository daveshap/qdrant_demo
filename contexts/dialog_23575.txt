FELICIA'S VOICE: You're rude. I mean, you're very rude.
GEORGE'S VOICE: Hey, I tried to get her off the phone.
FELICIA'S VOICE: You know what I'm talking about.
GEORGE'S VOICE: No, baby. Now look, that girl that called -- I have to talk to her, she'll do something.
FELICIA'S VOICE: Like what?
GEORGE'S VOICE: I don't know, kill herself. She's O.D.'d four times.
FELICIA'S VOICE: Well, is she your girlfriend?
GEORGE'S VOICE: No.
FELICIA'S VOICE: Are you in love with her?
GEORGE'S VOICE: Her?
FELICIA'S VOICE: Are you?
GEORGE'S VOICE: No.
FELICIA'S VOICE: Then it's not your problem.
GEORGE'S VOICE: It isn't?
FELICIA'S VOICE: No. You know too many sick ladies.
GEORGE'S VOICE: I guess so.
FELICIA'S VOICE: How do you expect to get anything done if you allow yourself to get sidetracked? Particularly in your business... you deal with women every day...
GEORGE'S VOICE: I guess so.
FELICIA'S VOICE: Don't worry, honey, I'll protect you.
GEORGE'S VOICE: Okay.
FELICIA'S VOICE: God, I adore you.

GEORGE'S VOICE: I'll call you back.
JILL'S VOICE: No you won't.
GEORGE'S VOICE: What do you mean?
JILL'S VOICE: I told you I get 'scared up here, so if you're not coming right now... I'm not kidding.
GEORGE'S VOICE: Okay.
JILL'S VOICE: 
GEORGE'S VOICE: Yeah, yeah -- 'bye.
FELICIA: Whoever she is, she doesn't give up, does she?
GEORGE: No.
FELICIA: What're you looking for?
GEORGE: My keys.
FELICIA: I thought you said you weren't going anywhere.
GEORGE: I'm not. I mean I've gotta see this friend of mine for a few minutes.
FELICIA: You mean that girl, don't you?
