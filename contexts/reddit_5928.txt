How can I help prep my friend for a PA Game Warden entrance exam.
I apologize in advance if this isn't the place, but I didn't know where else to go.  


As the title says, my friend would like to become a Deputy Game Warden in Pennsylvania. There is an entrance exam that she would have to take, but we're unsure what's on it. I have committed to helping her study and find a career outside of our current retail environment.  


 Is there anyone who could help guide us in the direction of what specifically she should brush up on? I've ordered some books on land management and ecology and we're going to go over our state's regulations and the like. We are also going to go over firearms safety and the various types of firearms, as I'm trained in that for work. Any additional recommendations would be greatly appreciated. Someone I know was killed on the job, and he'd probably want me to help her in any way I can. Thanks in advance!
