NONA: What is this?
QUINCY: Uh, your earring?
NONA: I look like some hoochie to you? I found it on your floor.
QUINCY: What are you doing in my room?
NONA: Quincy, I told you about these fat-ass girls.
QUINCY: We were just studying.
NONA: I'm not playing with you, these girls are looking to get you caught. They see you, they see dollar signs.
QUINCY: Okay.
NONA: You hearing me?
QUINCY: I've been hearing you.
NONA: How was your game?
QUINCY: Twenty-seven points, eleven assists and still undefeated.
NONA: Still the man.
QUINCY: Yup.
NONA: Where's your dad?
QUINCY: Said he'd be home later.
NONA: Later when?
QUINCY: I don't know, he had a meeting or something.
ZEKE: I had some players to see and hands to shake.
NONA: At one in the morning?
ZEKE: I'm not gonna get anywhere punching a clock just so my wife doesn't get an attitude.
NONA: I came second to the NBA. I'm not about to come second to this bullshit scouting job.
ZEKE: Yeah.
NONA: I'm just saying it'd be nice if you found time for your family. You should see the tramps coming after Quincy. If you don't talk to him...
ZEKE: I have.
NONA: You said you'd think about going back to get your degree.
ZEKE: No, you said I should get my degree. I like my bullshit" job
NONA: Fine, then how many nights home is that?
ZEKE: Keep your voice down.
