JACK: Why... why... why... ?
TYLER: Why what?
JACK: Why can't I get rid of you? Why can't I just wish you away?
TYLER: You need me.
JACK: No, no, I don't. I thank you, I really do. Thank you, but I don't need you anymore.
TYLER: Look, I can be selfish, I know that. I'm not blind to my own failings...
JACK: Noooo, please...
TYLER: From now on, we'll share Marla. We've been spending too much time apart...
JACK: ... no, no, no...
TYLER: No more running off without you. From here on out, we do it together.
JACK: Why are you doing this?!
TYLER: I'm doing this for us.
JACK: Please understand... I've gotten all I can from this, Tyler.
TYLER: If I leave, you will be right back where I found you...
JACK: I swear on my life, I won't...
TYLER: You will. You know you will.
