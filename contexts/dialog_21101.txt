STEW: Hey, Gallagher!
GALLAGHER: Yeah?
STEW: How about my breakfast? How do you expect me to ring a curtain down on an empty stomach?
GALLAGHER: It'll be ready in a minute.
STEW: Never mind that. If you can't get my breakfast ready - and can't get here on time in the morning - then you can go get yourself another job.
GALLAGHER: Sorry, boss—
STEW: Don't be sorry. Just get the breakfast, that's all.
GRAYSON: Hello, Smith.
STEW: Holy jumping swordfish!
GRAYSON: I suppose you know why I came—?
STEW: No, I have no idea - unless some of the silver-ware is missing.
GRAYSON: Now don't be absurd, Smith— May I come in?
STEW: Surely, come right in.
GRAYSON: Thanks. May I sit down?
STEW: Surely, sit down. If I had known you were coming, I would have thrown you up a waffle.
GRAYSON: I don't eat waffles.
STEW: You don't.
GRAYSON: Anne asked me to come and see you about the divorce.
STEW: She did—?
GRAYSON: She wants me to arrange the financial settlement.
STEW: Listen Grayson, I've got 106 bucks and 75 cents in the bank. Now Anne can have any part of that she wants, but she'd better hurry because I'm spending it awfully fast.
GRAYSON: You don't seem to understand. Anne doesn't expect anything from you.
