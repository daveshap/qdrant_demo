I told someone I like them for the first time in my life
Yep I did it. 90% certain they don’t like me back but I did it anyway. I need to move on with my life and having this crush is not helping me whatsoever ahahahahah

I told him I liked him and literally left so now I have to wait for an answer - I know I’ll get one he’s a good guy. 

God I just want him to reject me quickly so I don’t have anything to think about anymore!

Edit 1: idk if you guys who commented get notified when I update a post but here’s what’s happened so far

Saw him Wednesday/Thursday in class and our relationship hasn’t changed at all! I’m a cuddly touchy person so he touches me a lot for instance on Wednesday if I needed help while working on the desktop, he’d come over and basically plop his arms around me to get to the desktop - he even put his head on my head.  Another time we were listening to a lecture and I was falling asleep (I was sitting in front oh him) when I rested my head on the back of my chair he picked my head up with his hand and put his arm under it. Thing is, we haven’t talked at all about this whole me liking him thing, and we don’t text much of at all (he leaves me on seen actually) and last Thursday I asked him if we could chat and he avoided it - but to be fair to him he could’ve been busy like he said idk.

Honestly I’m so confused. I have no idea what to think. I messaged him today to tell him we should chat on Monday at lunch at that lunch was on me. So hopefully all goes well. I’m pretty certain that if he was sure about me he’d have already said something, so either he’s unsure or doesn’t want to let me down.

I have contingency plans for both situations; if he’s unsure I’ll suggest we could try dating - no pressure, or if he’s not interested then I’ll ask him to be more wary when it comes to touching me and teasing me.
