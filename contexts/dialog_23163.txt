ROMAN: Good morning Gale. Pleasure to be here.
GALE: It's a pleasure to finally meet you, Roman.
ROMAN: Well it's a honor to be here amongst so many fans of the genre. And I must say that any of you worried that Jerry Rapp, or Tori or David not returning to complete the STAB trilogy, have no fear, Roman is here. Aided with my excellent cast of newcomers I believe we're going to pull off one of the best Stabs yet.
GALE: Roman, from your enthusiasm it certainly seems that way. Honestly though, tell us, what's	your favorite scary movie?
ROMAN: Honestly, my life.
GALE: Your life?
ROMAN: Well if you were in my shoes, dealing with those big Time Sunrise Studio producers like I do on a daily basis, you'd watch how quick your life goes from a Walt Disney picture to a Tobe Hooper flick.
GALE: Would you excuse me for a moment?
ROMAN: Sure.
GALE: Jesus Christ you scared the shit out of me.
DETECTIVE KINCAID: I'm sorry Miss Weathers. Allow me to introduce myself, MARK KINCAID, L.A.P.D. Are you familiar with the actor Ben Damon, or the actress CHRISTINE PERKINS?
GALE: Well I interviewed Damon once for the show. He was a real obnoxious fuck. Any way, the second one, Christine Perkins, she had a part in Stab 2, didn't she? She was playing CICI.
DETECTIVE KINCAID: Both of them were found brutally murdered this morning under the Hollywood sign. Autopsy reports having come back to me yet but the bodies looked like something out one of the Stab films.
GALE: So is that why you're here? Is that why you're holding me from my show, to tell me about some brutal homicide I'm not even involved in?
DETECTIVE KINCAID: I wish that was all Miss Weathers, but there's more. The killer left a note.
GALE: A note?
GALE: That's Sidney Prescott's mother.
DETECTIVE KINCAID: There's more.
DETECTIVE KINCAID: I've tried to get in touch with Sidney Prescott, but she's keeping herself very well hidden. You're my one and only hope in finding her. Her life may be in grave danger.
GALE: I'd love to help, really I wouldn't mind being sliced at again by a maniacal psychopath, but I honestly don't know where Sidney is. After Windsor she dropped off the face of the Earth. The only other person that might know is, , not going to talk.
DETECTIVE KINCAID: And who would that be?
