The history of State bankruptcy in the United States?
Recently, Senator Mitch McConnell suggested that instead of Federal aid, he would favor ["allowing States to use the bankruptcy route"](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-22/mcconnell-says-he-favors-allowing-states-to-declare-bankruptcy?sref=Ktl4bRS0) to address financial struggles due to high public employee pension costs. However, while [cities have declared bankruptcy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_bankruptcy) there is no historical precedent for States having access to bankruptcy and under current law, States [cannot declare bankruptcy](https://www.politifact.com/article/2020/apr/24/can-states-file-bankruptcy-should-they-what-you-ne/). 


* How have States resolved serious financial crises? 
* What mechanisms of action are available to States as an alternative to bankruptcy?
* Have Federal State bankruptcy laws ever been proposed? How do they differ than municipal bankruptcy laws?
