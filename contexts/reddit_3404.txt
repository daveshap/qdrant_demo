“I’m not looking for a relationship”
Something I need to remind myself is to LISTEN TO SOMEONE WHEN THEY SAY THEY'RE NOT LOOKING FOR A RELATIONSHIP!!
 
What I learned is, if someone says this to you, I need to take it at face value. There is one of two reasons why someone would say that. The first reason is that they are only looking for something physical and they know that if you have repeat “hang outs,” the other party has a higher chance of catching feelings. They want to prevent that conversation in the future about defining the relationship and they don’t want to be the bad guy. They can say “I told you from the start I didn’t want a relationship.”
 
The second reason why someone would say this is because they are not interested in a relationship with you. What this means is, they don’t see you as a match. They would be interested in a relationship but you don’t have the qualities they want. Don’t take it to heart because that just means this wasn’t the right pairing. However, do leave the situation if you are, in fact, looking for a relationship.
 
Even though I know this, it can be hard to remember this!!!
