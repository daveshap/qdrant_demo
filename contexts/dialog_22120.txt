FREDDY: Nice Guy. When we got to the bar...
HOLDAWAY: ...What bar?
FREDDY: The Boots and Socks in Gardena. When we got there, I met Joe and a guy named Mr. White. It's a phony name. My name's Mr. Orange.
HOLDAWAY: You ever seen this motherfucker before?
FREDDY: Who, Mr. White?
HOLDAWAY: Yeah.
FREDDY: No, he ain't familiar. He ain't one of Cabot's soldiers either. He's gotta be from outta town. But Joe knows him real well.
HOLDAWAY: How can you tell?
FREDDY: The way they talk to each other. You can tell they're buddies.
HOLDAWAY: Did the two of you talk?
FREDDY: Me and Mr. White?
HOLDAWAY: Yeah.
FREDDY: A little.
HOLDAWAY: What about?
FREDDY: The Brewers.
HOLDAWAY: The Milwaukee Brewers?
FREDDY: Yeah. They had just won the night before, and he made a killing off 'em.
HOLDAWAY: Well, if this crook's a Brewers fan, his ass has gotta be from Wisconsin. And I'll bet you everything from a diddle-eyed Joe to a damned-if-I- know, that in Milwaukee they got a sheet on this Mr. White motherfucker's ass. I want you to go through the mugs of guys from old Milwaukee with a history of armed robbery, and put a name to that face.
HOLDAWAY: What kinds questions did Cabot ask?
FREDDY: Where I was from, who I knew, how I knew Nice Guy, had I done time, shit like that.
