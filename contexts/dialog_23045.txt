SIDNEY: Have a good trip.
MR. PRESCOTT: Sleep tight, sweetie.
BILLY: Close call.
SIDNEY: What are you doing here?
BILLY: It just occurred to me that I've never snuck through your bedroom window.
SIDNEY: Now that it's out of your system.

SIDNEY: So you thought you could sneak in my window and we would have a little bump-bump.
BILLY: No, no. I wouldn't dream of breaking your underwear rule. I just thought we might do some on top of the clothes stuff.
