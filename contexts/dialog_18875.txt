VADA: Do what?
HARRY: Well the thing is your room is right next door to ours, and so we thought, well, I thought, if you were willing we might move you to Grammoo's room, and use your old room for the nursery. See we're gonna be up half the night with a newborn and there'll be a lot of noise....
VADA: You want me to move?
HARRY: Well not far, just down the hall. Plus Grammoo's room's a lot bigger, and you get a view of the whole neighborhood.
VADA: Okay, no problem.
HARRY: Okay thanks, atta girl.
