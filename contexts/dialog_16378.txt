PETE: Morning, Sheriff.
SAM: Hey, Pete. How's it going?
PETE: Time marches on.
SAM: How much you got left?
PETE: Three months.
SAM: You stop growing that loco weed at your place, you'd see a lot more daylight.
PETE: It was for personal consumption.
SAM: You're going to smoke an acre and a half of marijuana?
PETE: I got a bad stomach. It helps me digest.
PETE: Your father never bothered me about it. Leastways not till the drug people got on his back in the late '60s.
SAM: I thought he busted you a couple times.
PETE: Different charge. I had a still. Made my own mescal.
PETE: That's how I ruined my stomach.
SAM: I'm surprised he bothered with it.
PETE: He was afraid I was going to poison somebody. Your father tried to do good for people--
SAM: So I've heard--
PETE: And your mother was a saint. That summer I built the patio at your house? She made me lunch every day.
SAM: Well, you were working there--
PETE: It could have just been a box lunch from the jail.
SAM: You built our patio while you were on the county?
PETE: Out in the fresh air, nice gringo lady making you pies--who's gonna sit back in a little jail cell all day? Sheriff Buddy, man. Como el no hay dos. And after that cabron Charley Wade--
SAM: I've heard Wade was a bit tough on the Mexicans--
PETE: He murdered Eladio Cruz. That tough enough for you?
SAM: Murdered him?
PETE: Chucho Montoya saw it with his own eyes. Shot him in cold blood.
RAY: You're out early.
SAM: Yeah.
RAY: Haven't seen much of you at the jail lately.
SAM: I been working on a few things.
RAY: Uh-huh.
SAM: I'm going over to the other side.
RAY: The Republicans?
SAM: No--to Mexico. I've got to talk to somebody.
RAY: They got telephones.
SAM: Gotta be in person.
RAY: Oh.
RAY: Sam? I--the Committee--you know Jorge and H.L. and all--they asked me--
SAM: They want you to stand for Sheriff next election.
RAY: Yeah.
SAM: You'd do a good job.
RAY: How 'bout you?
SAM: Don't know if I'll still want it.
RAY: I didn't want to be going around your back.
SAM: I appreciate you telling me.
SAM: You think we need a new jail?
RAY: Well, it's a complicated issue--
