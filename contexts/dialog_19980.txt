CHARLIE: We should go.
WESLEY: We don't have time to look at a hole in the ground. We can make Vegas in four hours. This one's got to be her.
CHARLIE: It's a very moving experience, trust me.
WESLEY: No.
CHARLIE: One of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World.
WESLEY: No... be dark before we get there. You wanna see the Grand Canyon at night?
CHARLIE: What difference does it make? She wasn't in Kansas City, or Houston, or Dallas. We went to every goddamn place Del mentioned and no Betty. So what the hell makes you think she's in Vegas? You think she's waiting for us with tassles on her titties? Vegas is too crass for Betty.
WESLEY: I said, 'No.' N-O.
CHARLIE: When I grow up I'm going to become a nurse or a veterinarian. I always want to help people and value all life
WESLEY: Do you hear yourself right now...? Like a fucking madman...
CHARLIE: Every American should see the Grand Canyon. Are you an American?
WESLEY: Yes, I am and we're not going. Act professional.
