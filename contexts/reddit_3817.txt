Ghosting is just rude and hurtful
So I'm messaging this girl back and forth for a week straight before the date flirting, getting to know each other etc. 

We go and have the best first date Roller Skating.. no times of silence, both having a laugh. After the Roller skating we drove back near hers. Watched the stars whilst chatting some more.. she came to me for a kiss before we parted ways. No indications of the fact she didn't have a good time.

Following days replies slow dramatically with "work is really busy" "might not be able to see you at weekend i suddenly might be busy" then they just stopped. I'm sorry but I've been brought up so if you just don't like someone.. or the chemistry wasnt there you could just tell them. How difficult can it be to say "I'm sorry i didn't feel a connection, good luck dating" instead its radio silence doubting everything you did on the date not knowing if it was something you said or whether she'd simply started talking to someone else. Its emotionally draining to put your heart into dating for it to get so easily rejected. 

TLDR; A week of constant messaging from online dating. 
1st Date went really well (at least i thought so).
Then a couple slow replies then gone.
Ghosting is simply a rude no backbone way of rejecting someone. 
If you're someone that does it please consider the other persons feelings.
