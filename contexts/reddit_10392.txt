Does anyone else have visual thoughts of their suicide?
I have suicidal thoughts daily and visualizations of killing myself for the past 6-7 years (I am 21)
They're not really intentional just a reaction to the deep pain and stress I go through every single day of my life. It's a shitty learned hopelessness coping mechanism I've created to cope everytime something bad happens I can just see it
