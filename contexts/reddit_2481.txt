Corporate life: Just opened up to boss about my complex PTSD and issues with men - she put me on a project with a known pervert with multiple sexual harassment claims against him. What do I do?
I don't want to say too much. I'm in a bad head space and have been having multiple panic attacks and now this. The man was fired from his previous company after making multiple women quit and has years of sexual harassment claims (he was a high level position so the company swept it under the rug for as long as possible). He started his own company which is who we're partnering with and she put me on it. I don't know what to do.
