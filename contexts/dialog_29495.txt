J'ONN: Where did you get this power?
RIDER: The power was within you.
J'ONN: I feel as if a weight has been lifted from my heart. How can I repay you for this miracle?
RIDER: Join my quest.
J'ONN: What is it you seek?
RIDER: What you seek. What all men have sought since time began - ultimate knowledge. But to find it we'll need a starship.
J'ONN: A starship? There are no starships on Nimbus III.
RIDER: Perhaps I have a way to bring one here.
J'ONN: But how?
RIDER: Have faith, my friend. There are more of us than you know.
