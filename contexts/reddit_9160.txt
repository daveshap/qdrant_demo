Some day, I will pay rent without being broke for the rest of the week.
Some day, I’ll pay rent without panicking and scrounging for $30 extra just to make it. And one of these days, I’ll actually have a savings account and won’t have to put my/my family/my pets health on the back burner just make ends meet.

Hopefully some day soon. It seems like literally no one else I know struggles as hard as me. It’s really starting to get to me, and I can’t keep up like this. I know I’m not a failure, but god damn if I don’t feel like one sometimes. I just wanna buy a new fucking outfit to make myself feel good without making it hard to pay bills. It hurts, and I’m constantly embarrassed by my financial situation. Fuck me.

Edit: I was seriously just feeling emotional off a $3 bottle of Aldi wine and venting about being broke and was not expecting so much support and good advice (and a silver lol). ily guys. One day we’ll all look back at our posts on here and be so proud of where we came from. You are not alone in your struggle. Keep grinding and make things better for yourself, everyone. You have tremendous power in your own life. Stay fucking positive.
