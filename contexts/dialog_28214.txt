JEANNE: I won't tell you more about that. I'm more afraid of displeasing Him than not answering you...
BEAUPERE: You're afraid of displeasing God when telling the truth?!
JEANNE: No...
BEAUPERE: Did God forbid you to tell the truth?
JEANNE: No. But my revelations were for the King of France, not for you.
D'ESTIVET: When you saw your king for the first time, was there an angel over his head?
JEANNE: If there was, I didn't see it...
D'ESTIVET: Then why did your king believe in you without any proof?
JEANNE: Go and ask him yourself.
CAUCHON: Jeanne, you are not helping yourself. If you don't answer our questions properly, your refusal will be taken into account.
JEANNE: These questions have nothing to do with your trial.
CAUCHON: I assure you they do. So... answer me... when was the last time you heard this voice?
JEANNE: Not long ago...
CAUCHON: When exactly? A day, a week -- when?
JEANNE: Last night.
CAUCHON: What were you doing when the voice came?
JEANNE: Praying.
CAUCHON: The voice was in your cell?
JEANNE: Yes.
CAUCHON: What did it tell you?
JEANNE: Many things...
CAUCHON: Did it give you advice? Good advice?
JEANNE: Go onto the next question.
BEAUPERE: Good advice for the French, not for the English! Do you think God hates the English?
JEANNE: I don't know, but you're all men of the church... why not ask Him yourself?
