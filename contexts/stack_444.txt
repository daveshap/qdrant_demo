Ubuntu 16.04 with Linux 4.4.0-83, is it outdated? I am a new to Ubuntu with 1 month of experience and I really like it. I am a web developer with Windows environment background. Since my new employer using Linux as their servers (Redhats and Ubuntu), so I take initiative to experience myself with Linux environment and thinking to fully switch from windows environment to Linux environment via Ubuntu. Even my manager using Linux but not sure which distro he is using.My question is, my laptop (Acer Aspire E15) currently set to dual boots with Windows 8.1 and Ubuntu 16.04 with Linux 4.4.0-83. Is it outdated and I need to update to newest version or still relevant just continue to use it?Below is my result when query : uname -mrs<blockquote>  Linux 4.4.0-83-generic x86_64</blockquote>--The story how I get to this version--My 1st set up was Ubuntu with Linux with Linux 4.8.0-58-generic. I found out that this version couldn't let my laptop connect to the wifi. I already forget what I do because there were a lot of try with several method and solution but it is seems to no avail. Until one day I discovered Ubuntu with advance boot. I try the lowest version which is Ubuntu with Linux 4.4.0-83. Thank god that this version can connect to Wifi.Thank you everyone!
