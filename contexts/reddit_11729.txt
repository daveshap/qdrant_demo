Everything is futile.
Despite all the groups and organizations that want to see different things in the world whether they be the various religions, political stances, or environmental care, nothing will ever change. Things will just continue as they always have and nothing drastic will ever happen, either good or bad, things will just progress, but no one will ever wake up and just realize that things need to change and will magically fix everything, all we can hope for is to just shoulder through and make our own bit of "paradise", if you can call it that, for yourself.
