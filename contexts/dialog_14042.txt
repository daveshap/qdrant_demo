DERRICK: Get lost, you scared me.
TITUS: Fish are all over the water...Come on, let us take a boat out.
DERRICK: Titus, you're so stoned, you'd end up in Spain.
TITUS: That's why you'll come with Titus, mon.
DERRICK: There's a storm comin', Titus. No boats are going out.
TITUS: Storm is what makes it interesting. Thass why all the fish are up. Less hook us a couple big ones.
DERRICK: I got work to do. Take the bake elsewhere.
TITUS: Up-tighteous and self-righteous.
