BUDDY: Now that's a really big house.
FOLEY: Jesus, look at that wall. Place almost looks like a prison.
BUDDY: No doubt the man's got some big-ass security system.
FOLEY: Time comes, we knock on the door. See if he wants to talk about old times. Go in the easy way.
BUDDY: Yeah? You think he'll let us in, we got Snoopy and the muscle-bound asshole with us?
FOLEY: Who says anybody's gonna be with us? I say we go to the fights tomorrow, find out what the Snoop's big plan is, then go in ahead of those guys -- <u>alone</u>.
BUDDY: Let Glenn deal with the Snoop, while we're off livin' the good life.
FOLEY: Tell me something, Buddy. You know anyone who's actually done one last big score and gone to live the good life? Cause it occurred to me that everyone <u>talks</u> about doing it, but I don't know anyone who's actually gone and <u>done</u> it. Do you?
BUDDY: What about that D.B. Cooper guy?
BUDDY: I mean, they don't know for sure he's dead. Look, there's always a chance we'll walk out've there with nothing. I say let fate decide.
FOLEY: Let fate decide? What're you, the fuckin' Dali Lama now?
BUDDY: My sister believes in fate, but not hell. That's why she stopped praying for the lost souls since you don't hear that much about purgatory anymore. But every day she asks her boss to pray I don't fuck up. Whatta you think, you think there's a hell, Jack?
FOLEY: Yeah, it's called Glades Correctional Institution and I'm sure as shit not going back there or any place like it.
BUDDY: You might not have a choice.
BUDDY: They put a gun on you, you'll go back.
FOLEY: They put a gun on you, you still have a choice, don't you?
