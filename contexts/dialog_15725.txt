CLARICE: No. He won't come after me.
ARDELIA: Why not?
CLARICE: It would be rude. And he wouldn't get to ask any more questions...
ARDELIA: Clarice - you did the best anybody could have for Catherine Martin. You stuck your neck out for her and you got your butt kicked for her and you tried. It's not your fault it ended this way.
CLARICE: The worst part - the thing that's making me crazy - is that Bill is right in front of me. Only I can't see him... Lecter said, everything I need to catch him is right here, in these pages...
ARDELIA: Lecter said a lot of things.
CLARICE: He's here, Ardelia.
