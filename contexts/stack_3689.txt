A line with a random length, attaching to the origin. What is the chance of a given point along 1D axis belonging to that line? The question is based on an engineering problem and, due to my lack of knowledge in statistics, I found it difficult to express the question clearly in maths language. The problem is formulated like this:1) Imagine there is an origin, and a 1D coordinate system (say, L);2) Along this 1D axis (L), there is a 'rigid' rod attaching to the origin, and its length is a random variable (always positive) and follows a PDF p1.Question 1: for each given point on the axis L, what is the chance of that point belonging to the thread. My solution to Q1: for a given coordinate x, for it to 'fall' into the thread, the thread length (a) has to be equal or greater than x. Therefore, the chance of a point x belonging to that rod is equal to the integration of that PDF, from x to infinity.Can anyone please confirm if my solution above is correct?If so, the question 2 is as follows: if the near end of the rod no longer attaches to the origin, but the location of it is also a random variable, which follows, say, another, PDF p2. Then, for each given point on the axis L, what is the chance of that point belonging to the rod?I am so confused by this question 2, as I have no idea what I should do with the potential interplay between these two random events (i.e. the length of rod and the location of near end of the rod). I wonder if anyone here can help me with this, or at least let me know what kind of 'theory' I should look into for solving this problem?
