Question on what to write to an employer about a job I applied for right before Covid19 hit
Ok so I submitted an animation test for a job as a 2D Animator right before things started shutting down due to covid 19. About a week after that happened I sent a follow up email asking how they were doing in this pandemic and asked if they had seen my animation test. They responded thanking me for checking in and said they sent the test to their CEO for review. That was 3/17, and it’s April now. 

I’m wondering should I send them another email asking about the position? I don’t want to come off as rude obviously but I’m wondering if there’s a way to word it so I’m not putting any pressure on them and to politely ask if the position was still available and not cancelled. Or if I should wait till April 17th so it’s exactly a month after they responded to me?

If anyone could think of a sample thing to send them as an example I’d really appreciate it. Or if they think I shouldn’t send them anything because it’s too soon, I’d really just like to know what’s the right play here.
