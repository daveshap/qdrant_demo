My boss didn’t tell me that my position was being eliminated on the weekdays and only work weekends. What should I do?
Location: Missouri, USA (small town) 

I’m a data entry specialist/on air personality/office specialist, basically a jack of all trades in the station. Typically work overnights but work early mornings quite often to help out. 

My boss has it in his head that the national wage is going up to $15/hour and so it has caused him to make snap decisions. He fired two of the girls in the office (who are single moms), a lot of people quit, and he eliminated my position to where I’m only working on weekends now starting January 9th according to the schedule.

He’s anti confrontational and never told me of any of these changes. We’ve heard rumors, but nothing set in stone. I only just found out because a coworker of mine was accidentally looped in with the manager’s email chain talking about the changes. 

Imo, I think the business is going under. He made a very idiotic decision for our sales team to offer 1 ad for 50% off and get another one free, essentially losing ad revenue with doing this deal. He figured this will draw business in but once that deal ended, we lost over half of the businesses that signed up for the deals. (Shocker right)?

What should I do? Should I hold on to this weekend position until I find another job?
