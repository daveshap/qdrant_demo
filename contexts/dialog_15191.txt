EARLY: Happy birthday Adele.
ADELE: Early, you are so sweet.
ADELE: I feel kind of like the wizard of oz, you know when she gets the red shoes.
EARLY: Well Dorothy, why don't you hand me that chili there.
BRIAN: Tonight turned out to be pretty interesting.
CARRIE: The party?
BRIAN: The warehouse. I'm not that drunk.
CARRIE: It was definitely the high point of the evening.
BRIAN: Just being there where it really happened. It was different... more visceral.
CARRIE: Mmm... I love it when you talk like that.
