MICHAEL: He's going to be our lawyer in Vegas. Nobody goes to him with any other business as of now, this minute. No reflection on Tom; that's the way I want it. Besides, if I ever need any advice, who's a better Consigliere than my father.
CLEMENZA: Then in a six month time we're on our own; is that it?
MICHAEL: Maybe less...
TESSIO: Let us fill up our Regimes.
MICHAEL: No. I want things very calm for another six months.
TESSIO: Forgive me, Godfather, let our years of friendship be my excuse. How can you hope for success there without your strength here to back you up? The two go hand in hand. And with you gone from here the Barzini and the Tattaglias will be too strong for us.
