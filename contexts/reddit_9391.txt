Truly insulting
When you just plain don't make enough money and someone says "just get another job that pays more." Genius!!! Why didn't i think of that? Teach me your ways you money guru.

Edit: thanks for the comments so far but I think the original point of the post has gotten overlooked. Minimum wage in my state (NC) is $7.25 an hour. I currently make a little over $13.00, which is much more than minimum wage. However, we are currently still in the middle of a pandemic and are going through an extremely high unemployment rate. It's not quite easy to find a great paying job right now. I work in healthcare and my hours have been cut. I'm bringing home $600-$700 every 2 weeks. No more than $1400 a month. My full pay wasn't great either.

I don't want to go into how minimum wage should be enough to live off of, like its original intention, or that pretty much everyone in the service industry is underpayed. Just that sometimes a flippant statement like "get a better job" isn't quite as easy as it sounds.
