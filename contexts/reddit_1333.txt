Does anyone else's anxiety peak on sundays?
It's Sunday and every Sunday, I feel more anxious than other days. Woke up with a panicky, nervous feeling this morning and can't shake it off. I worry too much about tomorrow and the next week for no good reason. I can't really enjoy Sundays because of that.
