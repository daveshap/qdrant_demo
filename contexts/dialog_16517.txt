BOB: What about you? Why are you here?
CHARLOTTE: My husband's here for work-he's a photographer- and I just came along...I'm not really doing anything right now, and we have some friends who live here.
BOB: How long have you been married?
CHARLOTTE: Two years.
BOB: Try twenty-five.
CHARLOTTE: You're probably just having a mid- life crisis. Did you buy a Porche?
BOB: I'm thinking about it.
CHARLOTTE: 25 years... that's a long time... Are you still in love with your wife?
BOB: Yes... I don't know, I don't know her anymore. I don't know if you can be in love with one person the whole time. I was... actually I was in love with her sister first, when I was twenty-one. And one day her sister said to me she wanted to move to Paris, so I said okay, and she said no, she wanted to move to Paris with Francois, and she's still married to him. And I moved in with Lydia... but I always really liked Lydia.
CHARLOTTE: Oh.
BOB: What do you do?
CHARLOTTE: I'm not sure, yet... I graduated last spring.
BOB: What did you study?
CHARLOTTE: Philosophy.
BOB: Oh, what do you do with that?
CHARLOTTE: I don't know, but I can think about it, a lot.
BOB: It takes a while to figure it out. I'm sure you will, though.
CHARLOTTE: Thanks. I'm sure your mid-life crisis will work out,too.
BOB: Thanks.
