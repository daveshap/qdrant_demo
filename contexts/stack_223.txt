Fine-tuning \"Open safe files after downloading\" Is it possible to fine-tune the \"Open safe files after downloading\" setting in Safari? For example, to make Safari open files like \".ical\" et. al., but not Zip-files.If macOS has no built-in support for this, could a solution be a UNIX script daemon that instantly detects new files in the Downloads directory and opens files with certain extensions?
