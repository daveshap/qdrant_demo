CASSIDY: You've been back to Dallas?
SCULLY: Yes.
CASSIDY: Are you going to let us in on what exactly you're trying to prove --
SCULLY: That the bombing in Dallas may have been to destroy the bodies of those firemen, so their deaths and the reason for them wouldn't have to be explained --
CASSIDY: -- those are very serious allegations, Agent Scully --
SCULLY: Yes. I know.
CASSIDY: And you have conclusive evidence of this? Something to tie this claim of yours to the crime --
SCULLY: Nothing completely conclusive --
SCULLY: I hope to. We're working to develop this evidence --
CASSIDY: Working with?
SCULLY: Agent Mulder.
KURTZWEIL: You found something?
MULDER: Yes. On the Texas border. Some kind of experiment. Something they excavated was brought there in tanker trucks.
KURTZWEIL: What?
MULDER: I'm not sure. A virus --
KURTZWEIL: -- You saw this experiment?
MULDER: What did it look like?
