JOHNS: Want you to remember this moment, Riddick. The way it coulda gone and didn't.
RIDDICK: Say that again.
JOHNS: Here's the deal. You work without the chains, without the bit -- without the shivs. You help us get off this rock....
RIDDICK: For what? The honor of goin' back to some asshole of a cell?
JOHNS: Truth is, Riddick, I'm tired of this head-up shit. I wanna be free of you as much as you wanna be free of me.
RIDDICK: You'd cut me loose, Boss?
JOHNS: Only if we both get outta this alive. And there may be a way.
RIDDICK: My recommendation: Do me. Don't take the chance that I'll get shiv-happy on your wannabe ass. Ghost me, Riddick. Would if I were you.
JOHNS: If you were me, I'd kill us both. C'mon, you wanna sit at the grown-up table or not?
