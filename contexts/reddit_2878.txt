Worked for 1 company for 22 years, now at 37 I need a job. Based on my experience what can I expect to qualify for?
My grandfather opened a carwash in 1967. My best childhood memeries of him are rising around to his 6 locations on Saturdays. At 12 years old he started working me for a few hours, jokingly "to pay for my lunch". At 15 i was a w2 employee. Now my grandmother has passed, my grandfather suffers from severe dementia, and the trust that controls his interests is making my job a living hell. I am very good at what I do, my grandfather used to joke about how he grew gimself a carwash manager, but its time for me to go. The good news is no matter what is next for me I have been forged in fire within a very tough industry. But I have no idea how to put that on a resume 

My job history follows this track

97-00 laborer, washed windows, dressed tires, cleaned towels, vacuumed

00-06 warehouse/maintenance -  Solely responsible for maintaining an inventory sufficient for the day to day needs of 6 full service carwashes and 4 quick lubes. First contact with vendors/suppliers. Pull orders and deliver them in a timely fashion. Also substitute manager and backup maintenance man for smaller issues.

06-11 (the old man sold off all but a few of the washes, so we closed down the warehouse) lube center manager. Hiring, training, scheduling, and maintaining a team of 4 to 5 lube techs. Inventory control, ordering all supplies, staying within budget, competitive pricing strategies, executing promotions and sales.

11-present general manager of a multimillion dollar grossing full service carwash and quick lube. I do everything here, hr, maintenance, dealing with govt regulatory agencies, it, cs, literally everything. My official duties as laid out to me by the board of the living trust who I now report to are as follows

- responsible for the facility, its overall physical image, proper care amd cleaning of equipment

- providing a safe, clean, carwash environment for customers and staff

- developing a team of people to deliver a quality service to the customer

- planning work schedules, assigning duties, training, employee evaluations, implementing disciplinary procedures and proper documentation

- responding to customer requests, complaints, and damage claims

- maintaining and controlling expenses and inventory, reduce shrinkage, and operate within budget

- developing and enforcing all company policies, programs, and procedures

And honestly that doesn't even really scratch the surface

Sorry for the wall of text, but I don't even know where or how to start organizing my experience in a way that will get a resume looked at. i don't know what type of job that I can reasonably expect to qualify for.  I dont know how to frame my experience not as nepotism, but hard work and dedication to success in an interview. I am really lost, and would appreciate any help
