UHURA: ... No response, sir.
KIRK: Sensors, Captain?
SPOCK: Scanners and sensors still inoperative. There's no way to tell what's inside the station.
KIRK: And no way of knowing if Reliant is still in the area...
SPOCK: Affirmative, Admiral.
KIRK: ... Blind as a Tiberian Bat. What do you make of the plantoid beyond?
SPOCK: Regula is class D'. It consists of various remarkable ores. Essentially
KIRK: Reliant could be hiding behind that rock.
SPOCK: A distinct possibility.
KIRK: Engine room... Scotty, do we have enough power for the transporters?
SCOTTY'S VOICE: Just barely, sir.
KIRK: I'm going down to the station.
BONES: Khan could be down there!
KIRK: He's BEEN there and hasn't found what he wants. Can you spare someone? There may be people hurt.
BONES: I can spare me...
SAAVIK: Begging the Admiral's pardon: General Order 15: 'No flag officer shall beam into a hazardous area without armed escort.'
KIRK: There is no such regulation.
KIRK: All right, join the party. Mr. Spock, the ship is yours.
SPOCK: Aye sir --
KIRK: Establish a parking orbit around the station and send me a complete damage report when you've talked with Mr. Scott.
SPOCK: Be careful, Jim...
