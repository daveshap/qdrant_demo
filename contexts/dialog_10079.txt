ANDY: Dammit Shelly! Why do you always have to be such an asshole!
SHELLY: I beg your pardon, I'm not an asshole. I'm an actor.
ANDY: Same thing.
ANDY: Look Shelly, you're my roommate and I like you... most of the time. But you gotta stop doing these things. Now, I set this date up for you, didn't I? So don't embarrass me. When you meet this woman, just relax and be yourself.
SHELLY: Would you be yourself... ...if you looked this this?
