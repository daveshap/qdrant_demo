PhD in Analytical Chemistry or Biochemistry?
I'm currently in a MSc program in chemistry. After I graduate from this program, I would like to pursue a PhD in chemistry; however, I would like to be employable \(in the non\-academic stream\) after I graduate from a PhD program. Which of the two chemistry PhD programs offers good employment opportunities: analytical chemistry, or biochemistry?
