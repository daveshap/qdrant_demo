She's not texting me back.
So, I am getting to know this girl quite well, and we've been texting almost all the time. I really enjoy talking with her and receiving attention almost all the time. However, lately she hasn't been responding much at all. It makes me nervous, and frustrated because it makes me think I'm the only one who cares. She talks to me at school just the same, but it just bothers me that she's not texting me back. I hate feelings clingy, especially when she's not. Anyway, that's what's bothering me. Should I say anything about it? Thanks for listening.
