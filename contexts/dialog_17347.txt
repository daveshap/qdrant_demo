TERESA: C'mon Charlie...one more day. I'll call in sick for work.
CHARLIE: No...we can come back in a couple of weeks. Besides, if we're both gone for three days it wouldn't look right.
TERESA: Ok.
CHARLIE: Bore.
TERESA: A paper on that one too?
CHARLIE: Yeah...but don't worry about that now. The Hemmingway one is first.
TERESA: It was nothing. I'm almost finished.
CHARLIE: Take your time. I don't care.
TERESA: I know you don't. You've been very preoccupied lately.
CHARLIE: That's the word...preoccupied.
