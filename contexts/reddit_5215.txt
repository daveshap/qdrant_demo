Job Application Appeal Request: Is it too much to go through each qualification one by one?
I applied to a state government position that is a great match for my qualifications, and is a position I have great interest in. Most of the Minimum Qualifications were to the effect of "knowledge of ...," "Communication skills," "Experience with this particular task." I meet all of them. Furthermore, I meet all of the Preferred, except for one (i.e experience with a particular system).

I have the knowledge (from coursework/BA) and the experience for this position. I always make sure I outline relevant coursework and go into detail when needed.

 I received an email from HR today that said I did not meet the min. quals. I have the ability to appeal, and I'm starting to write the letter. My original idea was to go through each qualification one by one and show how I meet each. However, I don't want this to be overkill. I also don't want to come off as hostile by starting each paragraph with "To the # qualification..."

I'm fairly certain that my application got lost in ATS, or my coursework didn't pass as "knowledge" with HR.
