DOROTHY: ...Toto, too?
GLINDA: Toto, too.
DOROTHY: Oh, now?
GLINDA: Whenever you wish.
DOROTHY: Oh, dear -- that's too wonderful to be true! Oh, it's -- it's going to be so hard to say goodbye. I love you all, too. Goodbye, Tin Man. Oh, don't cry. You'll rust so dreadfully. Here -- here's your oil-can. Goodbye.
TIN MAN: Now I know I've got a heart -- 'cause it's breaking.
DOROTHY: Oh -- Goodbye, Lion. You know, I know it isn't right, but I'm going to miss the way you used to holler for help before you found your courage.
LION: Well -- I would never've found it if it hadn't been for you.
DOROTHY: I think I'll miss you most of all.
GLINDA: Are you ready now?
DOROTHY: Yes. Say goodbye, Toto.
DOROTHY: Yes, I'm ready now.
GLINDA: Then close your eyes, and tap your heels together three times.
GLINDA: And think to yourself -- There's no place like home; there's no place like home; there's no place like home.""
DOROTHY: There's no place like home. There's no place like home. There's no place like home. There's no place like home.
