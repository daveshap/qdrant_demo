BUD: Sleep with me and the secrets of the West are yours.
MANNHEIM: Now that's a crap company, sure you'll make money on the takeover rumor, but what's being created. Nothing. No substance behind it.
BUD: Old values. Buy.
MARV: Buddy, buddy, some buddy; why didn't you tell me to buy Bluestar.
BUD: Hey Marv, he demanded confidentiality...
MARV: Gimme a break. You buy Bluestar Airlines yesterday. Today they just happen to get good news and the stock goes bat shit. You must have ESP. A real Nostradamus. Jesus Christ, what are friends for?
BUD: All right, I owe you one Marv.
MARV: That's right, next time a little birdie talks to you, talk to me too E.F. Hutton.
