DONE : New years resolution to saving $5000
Well, like the title says have $5k in the  bank. It's part of my news years resolution  and  by God I did it.  

For the curious, I set up and second  savings account in a different bank and had an automatic amount pulled off my paycheck. I dipped in to it a few times (needs must) but  it worked. 

I don't think I will make it to my other goal of investing  another $5000 by the end of the years but I will see what i can do. 

Wish me luck.

EDIT : Thank you all for your kind words. Yall have been very kind and supportive. 

 As for those asking how i did it mostly I had to come to a realization last year that there is some truth to the saying " if you chase two rabbits, you catch neither " I other words debts vs savings. I was chasing debts harder that saving and so I switched. If something happens lower debt balances will not help me but cash in hand will. It really is just that simple. 

Also I was giving a lot of thought to the concept of the Black Swan, The idea that unpredictable outliers are what will catch you completely off guard.  You can not really plan for a Black Swan but you can bet it will cost you money. 

Thank you all for listen me I really was not expecting this kind of response. I am deeply humbled.
