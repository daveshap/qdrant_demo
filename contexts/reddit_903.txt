After four years of suicidal ideation, depression, and the worst anxiety I’ve ever known, I graduated college today. Progress is possible, for anyone who needs to hear that right now.
College is undoubtedly the hardest thing I’ve done so far in my life, and there were a lot of times I imagined giving in before making it this far. I must admit it was very surreal being able to experience my ceremony after I was so convinced I wouldn’t make it so many times before. Shout out to all my fellow graduates, and to those still in university (or anywhere else in school/life) just know that if I can do it, anyone can. Progress is possible, just make sure you’re around to see it.
