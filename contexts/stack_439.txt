Screen brightness of Dell desktop monitor I am a new user of Ubuntu. It was pre-installed in my new Dell desk top. I am very happy with Ubuntu. But I am having a problem with the brightness of the screen. I am not able to reduce the brightness using the slider in System settings > Brightness and LockMy system specifications are as follows:Ubuntu 14.04 LTSProcessor: Intel pentium (R) CPU j3710 @ 1.60 Ghz x 4Graphics: Intel cherry viewOS type: 64 bitDisk: 972.9 GBMonitor: Dell E1916HVI checked the following folder:Computer > sys > class > backlight > acpi_video0The 'backlight' folder has only one folder inside it: acpi_video0Is it normal to have only one folder in the 'backlight' folder? I think the folder for the graphics card is missing, and it is causing the brightness. Currently I am adjusting the screen using the following command at the terminal:xgamma -gamma .75Please advise me how to solve this problem in the normal way. Thanks
