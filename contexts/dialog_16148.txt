ROBIN: Nothing is going on with us, is it?
GEORGE: Going on?
ROBIN: When I picked you up from the train station...what you said.
GEORGE: What did I say?
ROBIN: That thing about I was the most, you know, beautiful person you had ever known. What was that?
GEORGE: That was the truth.
ROBIN: You've never said that before.
GEORGE: I'll say a lot of things I've never said before. It's habit.
ROBIN: It sounded like a pick-up line.
GEORGE: I can't pick you up.
ROBIN: I'm married.
GEORGE: You bit my finger.
ROBIN: If I weren't married?
GEORGE: Let's not do this, okay?
ROBIN: I need to know.
GEORGE: You need to know what? Do I still love you?
