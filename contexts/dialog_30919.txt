GEORGE: I think you were too hard on Weathers.
SKIPPER: You do?
GEORGE: Yes. I do.
SKIPPER: I need to know what I'm working with; what their boundaries are. Their lives depend on it, and for that matter so does yours. We've got to bring them together. Make them a crew. We're as strong as our weakest link and I don't want to find that out the hard way. So, I will challenge them and they will come together.
GEORGE: Yes sir.
SKIPPER: You know the best thing about being a Skipper is the worst thing. It's all my responsibility. So I'll tell you what George, you stay off of my bridge, and I'll stay out of your galley. We'll get along that way.
