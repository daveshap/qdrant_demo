PSA: References - its NOT illegal for your employer to give one (even a bad one) (USA)
Apologies if you already knew this, but it seems to be one of the most pervasive beliefs in job-hunting that employers can't say anything negative about you in a reference check (or that they are only able to give dates you were there, or confirm if you're eligible for rehire).

This. Is. Wrong.  

So many comments are giving the OPs a false sense of hope/security by assuring them that performance that lead to them getting fired (for example) won't turn up in a reference check.  Far better advice would be to help them frame a response that will help them address the situation with potential employers before it comes up.

Don't just take my word for it; here's some reference articles (by a HR Professional and an Employment lawyer) that will - hopefully - put paid to this idea that it's illegal for past employers to give a bad reference. They also give suggestions for how to try and manage bad references while job hunting. I've added one from a manager on ensuring your references are in order.

For those of you who see this and think "yeah, but most reputable employers have policies against giving references", or think that only small businesses without a cadre of lawyers and HR personnel would give references... I'm a hiring manager with one of the very largest global Fortune 20 employers, and they have no such policy. To the best of my knowledge (based on getting references from them) - neither do our biggest clients/competitors.
