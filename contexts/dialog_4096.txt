GEORGE: This is it for me.
BARBARA: What is?
GEORGE: Just everything. You. California. The beach. This spot right here. I feel like I belong here, you know? It just feels right.
BARBARA: You happy, baby?
GEORGE: Yeah. I am.
TUNA: Look what the cat dragged in.
GEORGE: Holy shit, Dulli. What the hell are you doing here?
KEVIN: Well, I'll tell you. I was walking down the beach, minding my business, when who did I see but this fucking guy. I didn't know you guys were living in California.
GEORGE: Yeah, but what are you doing out here?
KEVIN: I'm on vacation. On my way back to school.
GEORGE: This calls for a joint. You want to do the honors?
KEVIN: No, man. I'm too fucked up.
TUNA: Nice weed, huh?
KEVIN: Fuck yeah. I never seen nothing like it. I'm fucking wasted.
GEORGE: Right on.
KEVIN: G-d, I'm stoned. I'm stoned. I'm really...
GEORGE: Stoned?
KEVIN: I wish there was shit like this back home.
GEORGE: Yeah?
KEVIN: Shit, yeah. Do you know how much money I could make if I had this stuff back east?
TUNA: No shit, Kevin?
KEVIN: That's right.
GEORGE: Yeah?
KEVIN: When there's something to move, it's too easy not to. Do you know how many colleges are in a twenty mile radius? U. Mass, Amherst, B.U....
TUNA: Smith. Hampshire....
KEVIN: Right. And Holyoke. There are a hundred thousand rich kids with their parents' money to spend, but there's never anything available. Nothing good, anyway. I'm paying four hundred dollars for shit.
GEORGE: The way we figure it, Barbara flies to Boston twice a week. Two bags per flight. Twenty-five pounds in each bag.
DEREK: You're kidding, right? That's a hundred pounds a week.
GEORGE: Yeah, I know, it's a lot of weight.
BARBARA: We're gonna call it California sinsemilla. Sounds exotic.
GEORGE: I'm telling you, Derek, it will sell.
DEREK: I don't know...
GEORGE: Here's the best part. We can charge five-hundred a pound.
DEREK: Come on, George, no one is going to pay that.
GEORGE: It's already been negotiated. It's done. The money is there waiting.
DEREK: Goodness.
GEORGE: Goodness is right. If you do the math, that's over thirty grand a week profit. I want you to be my partner on this, Derek. Fifty-fifty. That's fifteen thousand a week for you, my friend. In your pocket, free and clear.
DEREK: And I only deal with you?
GEORGE: Barbara and me. No one else.
