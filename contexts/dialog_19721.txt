NIXON: National security priority restricted and controlled secret.""
HALDEMAN: We'll work on it. I say we cut ourselves loose from these clowns and that's all there is to it.
NIXON: It's more than that. It could be more than that. I want Hunt paid.
EHRLICHMAN: Uh, we've never done this before, sir ... How do we pay? In ... hundreds? Do you fill a black bag full of unmarked bills?
NIXON: This is not a joke, John!
EHRLICHMAN: No, sir.
NIXON: We should set up a Cuban defense fund on this; take care of all of them.
HALDEMAN: Should we talk to Trini about paying these guys? Or maybe Chotiner?
NIXON: No, keep Trini out of this. Chotiner's too old. And for God's sake, keep Colson out. It's time to baptize our young counsel. That means Dean can never talk about it. Attorney-client privilege. Get to it. And Dean -- you stay close on this.
