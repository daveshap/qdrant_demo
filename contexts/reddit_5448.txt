I'm 24, in a construction field, and realize now I know very little about construction (but I'd love to learn)
I work for a very small construction company. The point of taking the job was that the pay (at the time) wasn't bad, the work that was pitched to me was very interesting, and there are a multitude of jobs that I would be qualified for when I left. What I didn't figure into the equation when I was hired was that the workplace was toxic. Supervisors calling you stupid, insisting you're stealing from them any time there's a discrepancy in AP/AR, calling you at home at 9 PM to complain about how the office is running, and constantly telling you you're doing a bad job. This has had a genuine impact on my mental health.

As such, I decided to leave about 4 months into the position. I did not have much time to apply to jobs, due to having to be on call every day from sunrise to sunset (which is no excuse and now I regret not making more time). Now though, I have put my foot down and started applying with vigor. The issue I'm running into is that the work I am doing is not the traditional role for someone of my title. I have received a few inquiries with that same title, and I'm realizing that I don't know near as much as I should because of the way my company is run.

What should I do? Keep applying for the same position and see if I get lucky? Tell the company I apply to that I'm intelligent enough to pick up anything they can throw at me? I'd love to stick to the same position and actually learn what I was promised to learn at my current job.
