EVAN: What time is it?
MR. MILLER: It's time for you to stand where the hell I told you.
EVAN: Wrong answer, fuckbag. This is the very moment of your reckoning. In the next thirty seconds you're going to open one of two doors. The first door will forever traumatize your own flesh and blood.
MR. MILLER: What's happened to -- How are you doing that?
EVAN: It'll change your daughter from a beautiful child into an empty shell whose only concept of trust was betrayed by her own sick pedophile father. Ultimately, it'll lead to her suicide. Nice work, daddy.
MR. MILLER: Who -- who are you?
EVAN: Let's just say you're being closely watched, George. Your other option is to get your porn off the rack and treat Kayleigh like... oh, let's say like how a loving father treats his daughter. Sound okay to you, Papa?
MR. MILLER: ...yes.
EVAN: Listen close then, fuckbag. You screw up again and I swear I'll flat out castrate you.
