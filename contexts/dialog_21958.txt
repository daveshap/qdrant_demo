PLATO: Jim!
JIM: Who's that!
PLATO: It's me!
JIM: How'd you find me? What's happening?
PLATO: They're looking for you!--
JIM: Yeah?
PLATO: Everybody! Crunch and Goon and everybody! I think they're going to kill you.
JIM: We know.
PLATO: They think you told the police on them. They--who's in there?
JIM: Judy.
PLATO: Help me in!
JIM: Hey where'd you go?
PLATO: I'm here. Shut up.
JIM: Come out come out wherever you are!
PLATO: Shut up. Are you nuts?
JIM: No. I'm scared.
PLATO: We're safe here. I hope. What do you think?
JIM: Wow! Well now-there-then!
PLATO: Isn't it crazy?
JIM: Wowee ow wow! Let's take it for the summer.
JUDY: Oh, Jim!
JIM: No--come on. Should we rent or are we in a buying mood, dear?
JUDY: You decide, darling. Remember our budget.
PLATO: Don't give it a thought. Only three million dollars a month!
JUDY: Oh, we can manage that! I'll scrimp and save and work my fingers to the bone...
JIM: Why don't we just rent it for the season?
JUDY: You see, we've just--oh, you tell him, darling. I'm so embarrassed I could die!
JIM: Well--we're newlyweds.
JUDY: There's just one thing. What about--
PLATO: Children? Well, we really don't encourage them. They're so noisy and troublesome, don't you agree?
JUDY: Yes. And so terribly annoying when they cry. I just don't know what to do when they cry, do you dear?
JIM: Of course. Drown them like puppies.
JUDY: See, we're very modern.
PLATO: Shall I show you the nursery? It's far away from the rest of the house. If you have children--Oh I hate the word!--or if you decide to adopt one--they can carry on and you'll never even notice. In fact, if you lock them in you never have to see them again, much less talk to them.
JUDY: Talk to them! Heavens!
JIM: Nobody talks to children! They just tell them one thing and mean another.
PLATO: It's wonderful that you understand so well--and so young too! You know the most wonderful feature about the nursery?
JIM: What?
PLATO: There's only one key.
JIM: We'll take it!
PLATO: Come on!
MOOSE: What time is it?
CRUNCH: Hang loose. We got all night.
MOOSE: That maid saw us. She could identify us too.
CRUNCH: You still want to go home, Moose?
MOOSE: No.
CRUNCH: Then shut your mouth before your guts run out!
