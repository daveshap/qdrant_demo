Applying for UK Visa - what documents can I submit in lieu of marriage certificate? My wife and I got married but have not yet been able to get the marriage certificate made in India (Indian citizens).We are planning to travel to the UK in March 2018. In our individual applications, we mentioned each other as our spouses and included all requested details (name, date of birth, passport number). Now the checklist is requesting for a marriage certificate.Is this going to be a problem? We are both working so neither is dependent on the spouse.What document/s can I submit in lieu of the marriage certificate?I don't think we have enough time to postpone the visa appointment and get the certificate in time - or is this the only way out?I would really appreciate any help and my apologies if this is a duplicate question. I could not find any query similar to this. Many thanks in advance.
