Just found my goal list from two years ago, I can’t believe I did it!
Exactly 2 years ago I decided I wanted to become a teacher. But in order to do that, I had to start really saving, because student teaching doesn’t pay but it takes as much time as a full time job for a total of 8 months. 

Anyways, I had created a “to-do” list of goals in order to get ready for student teaching. 
-get savings up to $300 by September 2016
-pay off credit card of $3300  by March 2017
-pay off car by August 2017

Y’all, I did it. I paid off my car, I have no credit card debt, and I’ve saved 12 thousand (!!!!!!) just in time to start my full time student teaching in August. I’m going to go down to working 1 day a week to focus on school. 

Make realistic goals for yourself. And don’t forget how far you’ve come.
