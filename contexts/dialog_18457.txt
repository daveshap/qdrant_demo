LONGFELLOW: Well, then, we must give the wrong kind of shows.
DOUGLAS: The wrong kind! There isn't any wrong or right kind. Opera is opera!
LONGFELLOW: I guess it is. But I personally wouldn't care to be head of a business that kept losing money. That wouldn't be common sense. Incidentally, where is the $180,000 coming from?
DOUGLAS: Well, we were rather expecting it to come from you.
LONGFELLOW: Me?!
DOUGLAS: Naturally.
LONGFELLOW: Excuse me, gentlemen, there's nothing natural about that .
