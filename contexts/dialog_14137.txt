SHAPELEY: Travelin' like this, you kinda lose track of what's goin' on in the world.
PETER: Thanks.
SHAPELEY: If you wanna get anywhere nowadays, you gotta keep in touch with all the news, is what I always say.
PETER: That's right.
SHAPELEY: Take that story there, for instance. Be kinda sweet if we could collect that ten thousand smackers.
PETER: Yeah—wouldn't it?
SHAPELEY: It's a lotta dough. If I was to run across that dame, you know what I'd do?
PETER: What?
SHAPELEY: I'd go fifty-fifty with you .
PETER: Why?
SHAPELEY: Cause I'm a guy that don't believe in hoggin' it, see? A bird that figures that way winds up behind the eight ball,[10] is what I always say.
PETER: What's on your mind?
SHAPELEY: Five G's—or I crab the works.
PETER: You're a pretty shrewd baby. We better get away from this gang. Talk this thing over privately.
PETER: Lucky thing, my running into you. Just the man I need.
SHAPELEY: You're not making any mistake, believe you me.
PETER: I can use a smart guy like you.
SHAPELEY: Say listen, when you're talkin' to old man Shapeley, you're talking to—
PETER: Do you pack a gat?[11] A CLOSE VIEW of the TWO shows the smile dying on Shapeley's face. He looks up quickly.
SHAPELEY: Huh?
PETER: A gat! A gat! Got any fireworks on you?
SHAPELEY: Why—no—
PETER: That's all right. I got a couple of machine guns in my suitcase. I'll let you have one of them.
