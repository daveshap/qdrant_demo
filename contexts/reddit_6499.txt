I'm at a great place now, but scared.
After years of working a list of jobs in my life, I have nailed a seasonal position that is awesome and a dream I've had to work for the company. It is seasonal, but I am hoping to stay on after the season is over. Here's my problem though. My fears. I have never had a hard time doing customer service. In fact, I have been so good at customer service that I have been a go to person because I am so extroverted and friendly. My customer service comes from my empathy and being able to understand where people come from and never trying to rip them off or do anything untrustworthy. I have had countless people tell me to my face how good I do and how much they appreciate me, some even writing letters and telling previous bosses how I was the only reason they come to the business. But, then there is the other end of the dream, the nightmare. Every place I have ever gone there are bosses or employees who hate me. No matter how hard I work or what I do, they always find ways to get rid of me. And I know it's my personality. I have spent so many times in rooms, just numb as some supervisor tells me I just am not a fit for their company and they have to part ways. I always leave the room just dumbfounded. I am always on time, even early, I always make the customer happy, I sell and make goals, I go beyond and above, yet it never is enough. But, the person who doesn't make an effort and lacks social skills will be always put on the work schedule and given the hours and will never be in trouble. Is being outgoing and friendly a threat to my fellow employees. Am I some sort of target because I must stick out due to my customer service. I want to continue working, but I don't want to keep getting fired over and over again. Has anyone else who is outgoing come across this?

TL;DR-Customers love me, employers hate me. Am I too eager and outgoing?
