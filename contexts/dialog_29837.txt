RAILLY: What have you done? Did you...kill someone?
COLE: No! I...don't think so. I stole a car and they chased me. I hit a tree.
RAILLY: See -- you can drive after all!
COLE: Yeah, sort of, I guess. I...I'm sorry I locked you up. I thought...I thought... I think maybe I am crazy!
RAILLY: What made you think that?
COLE: Jeffrey Mason said it was my idea about the virus. And suddenly, I wasn't sure. We talked when I was in the institution, and it was all...fuzzy. The drugs and stuff. You think maybe I'm the one who wiped out the human race? It was my idea?
RAILLY: Nobody is going to wipe out the human race. Not you or Jeffrey or anybody else. You've created something in your mind, James -- a substitute reality. In order to avoid something you don't want to face.
COLE: I'm...mentally divergent". I would love to believe that."
RAILLY: It can be dealt with, but only if you want to. I can help you.
COLE: I need help all right. They're coming after me.
RAILLY: First, it's important that you surrender to them instead of them catching you running. Okay?
COLE: It would be great if I'm crazy. If I'm wrong about everything...the world will be okay. I'll never have to live underground.
RAILLY: Give me the gun.
COLE: The gun! ... I lost it
RAILLY: You're sure?
COLE: No gun! Stars! Air! I can live here. Breathe!
