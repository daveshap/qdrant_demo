If I get salary continuation as apart of layoffs, am I technically still ‘employed’ when applying to other jobs
Layoffs are coming, and I’m looking into my situation.  Instead of severance, my employer offers a salary continuation plan where I receive a regular paycheck and benefits for a period.  Legally, if I take another job, the salary/benefits cease.

My question is if I’m laid off, can I present myself as employed to potential employers?  Obviously, being employed is more attractive to potential employers and gives me more leverage for salary negotiations.  It feels like salary continuation is basically a long paid vacation to my mind.  And the fact that I can’t collect unemployment under this arrangement also leads me to believe that I’m ‘employed’ in some sense.

Not sure how the background/employment verification process works with these situations...
