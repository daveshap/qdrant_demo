RENEE PELAGIE: How was I to know, my darling?
THE MARQUIS: How was I to tell you? By writing a letter? WITH WHAT, MY ASININE BRIDE?
RENEE PELAGIE: I beg you, Donatien... as your wife... your only ally... you must stop making such a monstrous spectacle of yourself.
THE MARQUIS: You've come to lecture me?
RENEE PELAGIE: To flaunt your deviance in public? Upon a stage?
THE MARQUIS: They've put you up to this, haven't they?
RENEE PELAGIE: You ought to court the Doctor's favor, not his contempt.
