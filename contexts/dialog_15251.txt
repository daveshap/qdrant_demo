TELLY: I don't understand why you do that.
CASPER: Why I do what?
TELLY: That.
CASPER: Why I give pennies?
TELLY: Yeah. Why you give money.
CASPER: Did you look at that guy? What the fuck. He had no legs. He had no half his lower body. He's gotta shit out of his ribcage.
TELLY: That's just it. It's elitist. It's reverse elitism. Because you give money to whoever is the most fucked up. I notice what you do.
CASPER: What are you talking about?
TELLY: Whenever you see someone who's really messed up, especially amputees and retards. You give them money. But if it's just a regular bum, you pass them by.
CASPER: So.
TELLY: So. These people live on the same streets. It's just that you reserve your money for those people who are massively fucked up. The regular bums aren't poor enough for you, you gotta give it to the bottom of the barrel scum fucks.
CASPER: So. You never know when you can end up like that.
TELLY: Right.
CASPER: I'll tell you why. Because when I was little, I had a fat cousin, cousin Luke. And he used to make fun of the handicapped. And one day he had a bad stomachache. So he drank a bottle of Pepto and his ass blew off.
TELLY: Shut up.
CASPER: I'm telling you the truth. And after that, I've always givin' my money to retards. Because that's the reverse of what he did.
CASPER: So really, it's good luck.
TELLY: Good luck?
CASPER: Yeah, good luck. I mean what the fuck. The guy had no legs.
