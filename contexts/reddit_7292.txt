Learning Photoshop/video editing software for jobs
I would love to learn PS, plus other video editing softwares as well but I don’t have a formal education on them. Let’s say I self teach or even buy the udemy course to follow and learn from and eventually get decent at it...how could I start finding projects to work on and adding it to a resume? How does that process work? Let me know on this, thank you!
