BEN: Good morning!
LUKE: What do you mean, 'good morning'? Do you mean that it is a good morning for you, or do you wish me a good morning, although it is obvious I'm not having one, or do you find that mornings in general are good?
BEN: All of them altogether. You seem to have gotten yourself into a fine mess! What happened?
