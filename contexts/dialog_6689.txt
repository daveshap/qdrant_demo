DANIEL: Get that, will you?
RAYMOND: Why do I always have to answer the phone?
DANIEL: Because you're the closest.
RAYMOND: I'm not any closer than you are.
DANIEL: Why is everything an argument with you?
RAYMOND: I'm just setting my boundaries.
DANIEL: Hello?
SAMI: Get out of the room! You've got company coming up. I'll meet you at the Chevy.
DANIEL: Raymond, grab the tapes. We're leaving!
RAYMOND: Why do I have to pick up the tapes.
DANIEL: Jesus!
