ED: You're kiddin' me, right?
WILSON: What do I do, then, look in the bleedin' Yellow Pages?
ED: These are not guys you can just go run a number on, man.
WILSON: Thought perhaps there'd be dispensing machines, you know. Bung in your coins, come out with a .44 Magnum, fully-loaded.
ED: Are you a resident of California? You gonna fill out forms, man? Do the background check? Go through a three-day waiting period?
WILSON: Sod that. Gotta get back before my probation officer wonders where I've skived off to.
ED: Probation? Man, you crazy. They shouldn't've let you outta your country, much less prison.
WILSON: Travelling on a dodgy passport, n' all.
