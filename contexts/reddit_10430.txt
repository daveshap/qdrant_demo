never gonna live to be a teenager
it's fifty past midnight where I am, and I plan on leaving in ten minutes or so.

made a throwaway account so the people who know me on other subreddits don't see this on my account. I don't want to upset anybody. I know there are probably people preparing to comment "why do you have reddit, you are baby, this is why you are Big Sad toxic community is poisoning our children omg BIG PHARMA" but please, dear strangers, do not worry. I won't be going against reddit's terms of service for long, now. :')

I know this post is probably gonna be forgotten in about an hour or so, but I want to make record of something while I have time, even if nobody reads it:

My name is Hannah, I'm twelve years old

I love music and painting things and I was here once, too.

things with my family are messy. they want to love me, I think, but things can get in the way. I wasn't what they were expecting, even less so what they were hoping for. I know they'll be okay if they believe that they tried to fix me, and I hope the best for them.

 I hope everyone on here has a moment of luck for them, too, maybe one that ends up saving them from their own hands. Please just try, as hard as you can, because when you're too far gone you'll wish you had.

You are all worthy of happiness. I'm sorry life has treated you like it has, or if you're just somebody who tunes in on here to try and help, you are wonderful and appreciated. 

Try to look for the good while you can still see. I love you, hope I don't see you too soon.
