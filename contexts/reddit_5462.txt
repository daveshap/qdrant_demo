New job but grossly underemployed
I am lucky enough after 5 months of unemployment to have a new job. The only problem is I am extremely underemployed. My prior position did not have the title linked to it but my experience was that of a Senior Tax Consultant or Tax Manager. During my struggle with un employment and lack of title I decided to go after positions that would have had a similar title, not thinking about the gap in experience. At my prior position I was charged with client relations, account management, value negotiations, analysis, and billing. I unfortunatly had a crash course in my last job into every facet of tax consulting and management. My current position pays well and is at an extremely good company but is unfortunatly only an analyst position, my prior position at this company would be considered a Senior VP. I know I should likely deal with my position and deal with it but after 2 months it is obvious Im very underemployed. Im unsure about how to approach this. Its a great company and would love to keep working here but I fear I won't be able to deal with not being able to put any of my experience to use. I can already see ways to keep the cost of projects down and save 100s of hours of labor. What should I do, how do I tell my boss? I am currently working 9-8 as well and am on call until 9pm
