ELLIOT: Do you want me to tell you what it was like, reading that review at the newstand with trucks rumbling past and street vendors facing Mecca?
NICKY: What was it like?
ELLIOT: I said, `I'm dead'. He killed me.
NICKY: You've worked with Elliot?
PAISLEY: I was in the fish-market play. What happened to him?
NICKY: There was a review.
PAISLEY: I think I remember.
NICKY: So does Elliot.
PAISLEY: Not one of Steven's finer moments.
NICKY: Oh. You know him.
PAISLEY: A little.
NICKY: And he has finer moments now and then.
PAISLEY: He has -- something. A funny little quality I find --
NICKY: Endearing.
PAISLEY: Engaging.
NICKY: Elliot wants to kill him with a railroad spike.
PAISLEY: A little drastic maybe?
NICKY: Say it again.
PAISLEY: What?
NICKY: You know what.
PAISLEY: Alla puttanesca.
NICKY: One more time.
ELLIOT: Is it safe?
NICKY: Do we care?
ELLIOT: I think we Nought to wait.
NICKY: I say we go.
ELLIOT: You say we go?
NICKY: Do not inhale.
ELLIOT: I'm not ready.
NICKY: Here we go.
ELLIOT: The man has taken over my mind. He's not only out there. He's in my head and I can't get rid of him. I can't write a word without imagining his response. I'm paralyzed as an artist.
NICKY: I don't have the problems that artists have.
