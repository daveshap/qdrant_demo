A friend of mine moved back in with his family because his dad was laid off.
His current action plan:

*Get a second job 

*Get his dad a job at his current workplace

I suggested rideshare and/or food delivery as a second job (makes his own hours and I assume almost he can immediately start working).

Any other part-time/gig jobs I can suggest?

His main job may have an extra shift here or there but no guaranteed overtime and fixed salary (promotion is the only way to get a bigger salary).
