The gun jammed
The title says it all. A little over a week ago, I put a shotgun barrel in my mouth and pulled the trigger. It didn't go off. The fucked up part is that I'm just sitting frustrated about why it didn't go off. I saw my therapist last Saturday and told him about it. He asked if I was willing to bring the gun to him for safe keeping. I complied. Later that day I checked myself into an urgent psychiatric center and they almost kept me. They prescribed Zyprexa instead and after telling my story, the psychologist started crying. That didn't help. The Zyprexa has made me feel numb. I'm not sad, and I'm not happy. I don't want to be alive anymore, or rather, I simply wished I didn't exist. Just needed to get that out. To anyone that reads this, thank you.
