I don't know myself
I'm not sure why I chose this subreddit, except for the fact that I'm a teen but I dont think this is a teen problem. A little background. A while ago I hated myself and doubted I could ever create a decent future for myself. I guess I sort of got depressed. I just either slept a lot or binge watched Bojack Horseman, Daria, and Bob's Burgers. I didn't feel a need to do work outside of school because, what's the point. And afterwards I was sad because I felt as if I had no purpose. I'm kind of better now. I've decided that I don't have to be shitty. And that I can control my future. And I have been trying to avoid self loathing. (This is very recent). I've been trying to get in touch with my hobbies again. Reading, drinking tea, taking pictures, drawing, and possibly writing. But I feel as if I might not like these things anymore. I feel like a completely different person, and I don't like it. I wish I was back to my usual self. But I don't know how to go back. Any advice, preferably from people who have experienced this before? Thanks in advance.
