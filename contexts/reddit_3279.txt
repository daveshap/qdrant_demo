Working a job and going to college full time a good idea?
I work 32 hours a week and go to four classes. I can feel my stress levels going through the roof. I have bills to pay because my mother doesn’t make enough to support me anymore and she doesn’t get child support. 

I can’t not pay bills, but when I talk about working less she flips and tells me I’d have to leave the house and completely separate from her. Then I’d need to work more. School is very important to me and having ADHD makes it that much worse. 

Work is just draining me. I’m constantly exhausted and stressed trying to get school work done. 

Anyone have any advice?
