I thought I was getting a 2k raise today. Instead I got 13k!!!
Y’all I have never made this much money in my life. I don’t know what it’s like to be able to put money in savings only to not have to pull it out almost immediately. This is life changing. I am so excited.

EDIT: Wow I wasn’t expecting this to blow up- THANK YOU for all the upvotes, the awards and the excellent advice I’ve received!! 

To answer some of your questions, I took this position back in March, as an assistant in an administrative/ accounting type capacity. I’d had about five years of related experience. My immediate supervisor abruptly resigned in June, and I stepped in to fill the role. In the process I discovered hundreds of thousands of dollars in discrepancies (which I have managed to mostly correct.). My initial salary offer (the 2k raise) was made before these problems came to light and it was supposed to take place at the beginning of the year. 

I am not rich by any means not even after the increase- I went from making low five figures to mid range five figures, but the increase is probably all the more significant because it boosts me and my kids from “low income” into “living wage” territory. It’s thrilling for me to see some light at the end of the paycheck-to-paycheck tunnel after years of being dead broke and unable to even afford normal basics. 

Yes I am paying this forward already (see my comment history for details). 

And yes- I am meeting with the company’s financial advisor (they provide one free to employees) to determine my best course of action moving forward as I don’t have much experience with saving successfully. I am determined to build a nest egg and buy a house as soon as I can.
