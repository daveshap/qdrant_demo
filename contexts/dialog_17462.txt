PARRISH: Joe, that's the kitchen.
JOE: Thank you.
DREW: That was 'Joe'.
ALLISON: He's cute.
DREW: Very.
PARRISH: ...I'm sorry, I'm a little discon- certed, that stuff between you and Susan -- uh -- threw me.
JOE: 'Threw' you? Where?
PARRISH: Shook me up. I mean that you knew her and everything --
JOE: I didn't know her. The body I took knew her. The man she met in the coffee shop this morning. I - uh - took him.
PARRISH: So there's nothing between you and Susan?
JOE: No.
PARRISH: I wish you had said something to me about staying here --
JOE: It hadn't occurred to me until then. I was just having such a wonderful time -- Besides, isn't this what I'm here for?
