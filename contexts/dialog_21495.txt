MIRACLE MAX: -- get back, witch --
VALERIE: I'm not a witch, I'm your wife. But after what you just said, I'm not even sure I want to be that anymore.
MIRACLE MAX: You never had it so good. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 95.
VALERIE: True love." He said
MIRACLE MAX: Don't say another word, Valerie.
VALERIE: He's afraid. Ever since Prince Humperdinck fired him, his confidence is shattered.
MIRACLE MAX: Why'd you say that name -- you promised me that you would never say that name --
VALERIE: What, Humperdinck? Humperdinck. Humperdinck. Ooo-ooo, Humperdinck
MIRACLE MAX: I'm not listening.
VALERIE: A life expiring and you don't have the decency to say why you won't help --
MIRACLE MAX: Nobody's hearing nothing!
VALERIE: Humperdinck. Humperdinck! Humperdinck!
