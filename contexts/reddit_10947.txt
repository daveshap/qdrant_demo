Why do others get to decide if we have to live or not? Let me die.
Why are we forced to stay alive? Why do others go out of their way sooo much to pretend they care by setting up acts like the unusable hotlines and expensive therapists... If I want to die and literally end it all, that should be my choice. I am a burden and I am reminded of that every single day. Just let me go. Why does it have to be about you and your potential grief? I am obviously lacking resources and suffering from a life long illness that will never get better. So why should I continue to suffer? So you dont have to pay for a funeral? That shouldn't even be a thing anyway. 

I also wish overdosing was easier.
