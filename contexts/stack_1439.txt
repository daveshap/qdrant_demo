Parallel RLC Resonance bandwidth Good day ,I need help in understanding a practice problem that my professor gave us.<blockquote>  A parallel resonant circuit has Q = 20 and is resonant at \u03c9O = 10,000 rad/s. If Zin = 5k\u2126 at \u03c9 = \u03c9O  what is the width of the frequency band about resonance for which |Zin| \u2265 3k\u2126?</blockquote>I know that in a parallel RLC circuit , the quality factor Q is given by the equation Q=\u03c9/BW and that the question seems to ask about the bandwidth .What I don't understand is the relevance of Zin and |Zin| in the question. I know that in resonance,the impedance is purely resistive but I can't  understand what |Zin|\u2265 3k\u2126 means.Any help would be appreciated.
