DOROTHY: You heard about Julia Wolf?
NICK: Yes.
DOROTHY: There.
NICK: What are you trying to tell me? That you did it?
DOROTHY: Yes. I hated her for coming between my mother and father. She kept me from seeing my father. I went down there to ask her where he was. She wouldn't tell me, and I shot her.
NICK: Where did you hit her?
DOROTHY: Why... in the heart.
NICK: Pretty good shot you are. What did she do?
DOROTHY: She fell down.
NICK: Did she make any sound? Didn't scream?
DOROTHY: I don't know.
NICK: Which way did she fall?
DOROTHY: She... she fell over backwards.
NICK: Oh, yeah? People fall toward a shot, you know... not back from it. I knew you were lying.
NICK: Where did you get this gun?
DOROTHY: I bought it in a pawn shop.
NICK: Don't lie to me.
DOROTHY: That's the truth.
