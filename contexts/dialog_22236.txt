SCHAEFER: What do you want me to do, Orson? Radio City won't premiere the picture. Louella threatened them with some bullshit about
WELLES: Then find another theater
SCHAEFER: You don't think I've tried? No one is willing to open the picture
WELLES: Then we'll open it in Detroit or Dallas or Kalamazoo for God's sake! We'll show it in goddamn circus tents and--!
SCHAEFER: Listen to me. The press ban is killing us and the distributors won't book it. And meantime I'm dealing with the stockholders in New York who are scared shitless -- and I'm this far from getting fired myself -- and you don't have a friend in the world but me right now. So you have got to trust that I'll do what I can to--
WELLES: Do what you can"?! That's not good enough I"
SCHAEFER: Well it' s all you've got !
WELLES: You're with them, aren't you? You're going to bury my movie. They bought you!
SCHAEFER: For Christ's sake, shut up--
WELLES: Why don't you just have the guts to admit it
SCHAEFER: How dare you talk to me like that! Do you think I'm like all the rest of those pirates?! Like Mayer and Warner? Is that what you think--?!
WELLES: It's just that my movie is so-
SCHAEFER: Your movie" -- I am so sick of that! It's your movie -- but it's his life! Did you ever think about that?! Did you ever think about that old man and Marion having to watch as you tore them apart?!"
SCHAEFER: Do you every think for one second that you might have some responsibility for what you're doing?! For cutting and slashing everything in your way so you can have your goddamn movie?!
WELLES: That soulless monster gets no tears from me.
SCHAEFER: Who the fuck are you trying to kid? You are that soulless monster.
