After accepting the job offer, the company seems to ignore me. Should I be worried?
I accepted the job offer after negotiation, and just completed the background check process with the company. However, the recruiter and hiring manager recently seemed to ignore/unenthusiastic to my emails and phone calls (when I followed up, asked questions), compared to the time they extended me the offer (they responded very quick).

After I accepted the offer, I sent to the hiring manager and other interviewers thank-you emails to express my appreciation but they didn't reply.

I understand that they were busy but I'm also worried about the situation that they might lose interest in hiring me because of some unknown reasons and might be considering other candidates. I don't feel that they are as excited about hiring me as before. Since it's at-will employment, they can rescind the offer anytime they want.

What should I do in this situation? Should I be worried? How could I confirm their interest in hiring me? Based on the offer, I would be starting to work with them in a week.
