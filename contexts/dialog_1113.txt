WOODWARD: --That cash fund that financed the sabotaging of the Democrats--five guys had control--
BERNSTEIN: --Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, Kalmbach--
WOODWARD: --we're working on the last guy now and we're going all the way--that fifth man was Haldeman.
SLOAN: --I'm not your source on that--
BERNSTEIN: --it's gotta be Haldeman--someone from the White House had to be involved--
WOODWARD: --and it wasn't Ehrlichman or Colson or the President.
SLOAN: No, none of those.
BERNSTEIN: --that leaves Haldeman, period.
SLOAN: I'm not your source on that.
WOODWARD: --look, when the Watergate grand jury questioned you, did you name names?
SLOAN: Of course--everything they asked--
BERNSTEIN: --if we wrote a story that said Haldeman controlled the fund?--
SLOAN: --let me put it this way: I'd have no problem if you did.
