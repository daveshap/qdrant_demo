I know I’m being laid off. I don’t know when.
This is a little complicated, but I’m very new to the workforce and run the development department for a mid-size nonprofit. I have 9 months of experience in this space with the rest of my resume filled with internships. I also don’t have a bachelors degree. 

Last week it was decided that our organization would merge with a larger nonprofit in the city for financial reasons. This nonprofit is backed by a bank, so they have no need for a fundraising arm. My job is the only one being eliminated and I’ve been ordered to stop working entirely. 

It’s going to take me a while to find something. I have less than a year of experience, but it’s all leadership so I keep getting bounced from entry level and also bounced from mid-level leadership roles.

I am supposedly going to get two months severance, but I don’t know when it will start. Which means i can’t apply for jobs and I know I won’t find something quickly. I only know my last day will be sometime between next week and February. 

Any advice for how I can proceed in this situation? They’ve got me twisting in the wind and I don’t know how to move forward.
