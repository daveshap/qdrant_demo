BIG PINK: How can I ever thank you?
BASQUIAT: I'd like to squeeze your titties.
BIG PINK: Come on.
BASQUIAT: Wanna Mac?
BIG PINK: No, I'd like the scarf.
BASQUIAT: Have a Mac.
BIG PINK: I don't eat junk food.
BASQUIAT: Oh. I didn't know. I'll take you to the best restaurant in town. You'll miss a great meal and I'll keep the scarf, anyway. What's your name?
BIG PINK: You're a fast mover.
BASQUIAT: No name? That's ok. I'll just call you Big Pink.
GINA: Hi.
BASQUIAT: Hi.
GINA: What's that?
BASQUIAT: A present I picked up for you.
