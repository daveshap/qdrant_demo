My 13 yo daughter overdosed on about 6 grams of Wellbutrin and 1500mg of Zoloft.
I am trying so hard to make this right. She was airlifted to children’s hospital and now she’s laying in her hospital bed unresponsive and her muscles are jerking. 
This has been the scariest day of my life. That child is my entire world. She’s all I have. I have out my heart and soul into raising her. I never want to lose this little girl. 
But here I am. She’s about to be 14. She’s a little on the eccentric side, but she has a heart of gold. She’s never met a stranger. But ever since 8th grade has started, she has been getting bullied. And the teachers don’t really do anything about it. This was her way of coping. 
I went to wake her for school this morning and found her covered in vomit and she had been hallucinating and having seizures for hours probably. What if I hadn’t found her?
Why does she feel like this is the only way? I want to make all the bad go away. How do I do this? How do I help her cope? 
I didn’t know who to turn to, so I’m turning to reddit. Please help me understand how to help her. 

**UPDATE

My daughter is still in recovery but she’s come so far! We are no longer in ICU. We were moved to the special care unit which is a step down. 
She doesn’t remember anything. She doesn’t even remember school that day. She’s so upset that this happened. She said she doesn’t understand why and how she did it. 
She was hallucinating pretty bad over the last couple of days but that has subsided tremendously, if not completely. 
She’s still unable to determine if she’s in reality or if this is a dream.  And it’s heartbreaking to tell her this is reality, but this reality is way better than the one I thought I would have. 
I am the luckiest woman on earth.
