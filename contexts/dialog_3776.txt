KAREN: Curtis, it's three in the morning. I'm really not in the mood for one of your practical jokes.
CURTIS: It's not a joke. I've got the stiff sitting in the morgue right now -- look, just come up and see him, okay? Five minutes, that's all I ask.
KAREN: I thought you promised to give me some distance?
CURTIS: This is purely professional curiosity, Karen, I swear.
KAREN: Five minutes, not a second more. And I don't want to hear a word about us"."
CURTIS: No problem.
KAREN: You haven't started in on the internal organs?
CURTIS: Just the blood sample from the pericardial sac.
CURTIS: That's weird --
KAREN: What?
CURTIS: He looks different now, burns are less extreme, some of these wounds have closed up --
CURTIS: Tell me something, honestly, you ever have second thoughts about us?
KAREN: Sometimes --
KAREN: -- but then I remember what an ass-hole you were and I'm snapped back to reality.
CURTIS: Jesus, Karen, you're breaking my heart here --
