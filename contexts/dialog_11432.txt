BEN: Oh -- hello, Mr. McCleery.
MR. MCCLEERY: Who screamed?
BEN: It's all right, Mr. McCleery.
MR. MCCLEERY: Screaming isn't all right. Not in my house it isn't.
BEN: It was just a visitor. But it's all right now.
MR. MCCLEERY: What did you do to her?
BEN: Look -- she's all right. She's upset and she screamed. But she's okay now.
