What do I say to employers
Graduated as a registered nurse in 2017. 

2018 I worked as a registered nurse. 

Start of 2019, i resigned because I was suicidal. Have had multiple car accidents and overdoses. So I was in psychiatry and psychology all throughout 2019. 

It's now 2020 and i want to get back into practice but employers will ask me where I have been and why I have to be monitored/supervised for medication administration.
 
Should the gap be mentioned in my resume? What do I say without going into all this detail? And will I be able to find work again due to what has happened in 2019?
