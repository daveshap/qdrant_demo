WADE: What's this?
GALLAGHER: Fill it out. Standard issue mal- practice insurance. All Cops carry it.
GALLAGHER: Mug sheets.
WADE: I remember what he looks like. I can't forget.
GALLAGHER: Edicon system made these. Ages, photographs. We use it to find missing children.
WADE: He's not that old yet. You've lost confidence in me.
GALLAGHER: No, but he's going to be by tomorrow. He's aging. 'Bout the entire twenty years lost while being frozen in forty-eight hours. In that time he'll be an old man. Could be a year, an hour, or all at once. Called NPA Syndrome. Natural Pro- gression of Aging. It affects each individual differently. I'm sure it's painful.
WADE: You son-of-a-bitch. How do you stop it?
GALLAGHER: We have an antidote that'll retard the aging process.
WADE: Give it to me.
GALLAGHER: When you bring in Doucet.
