Uphill battles are getting so old.
In December I was having martial issues and moved home with my parents. I have a five year old, my job transferred and promoted me and at the time it seemed like a good decision. 

My husband and I reconciled and he moved here and found a job right away. We've been working for 90 days and my father is being unreasonable to live with (we've had issues in the past, he's verbally and physically abusive and I thought he had sought help but apparently he's worse than ever) and I need to move out to keep my family safe. 

Well the apartment we lived in never sent us our certified letter and itemize bill so we haven't paid them anything. We went to get an apartment today and we're denied because of our rental history (this other apartment is the only place we've ever rented). I'm so furious and broke and cannot pay the outrageous amount they are asking and I have no help. I have nowhere to go. I need to get out. I'm so stressed out. Ugh.
