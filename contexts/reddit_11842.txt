I think my mom hates me.
We've never gotten along, but I'm the middle daughter of an otherwise all-male family. We never have had a close relationship, but I had felt like I could talk to her. 

Some back-story; both her and my dad have extensive educations. It has been ground into us that education is the only thing that will prevent us from having miserable lives. (Their words, not mine.)

I flunked out of college this year. I moved back home, and have been without a plan all summer. Every day she would drop hints about me failing at one thing or another, or getting career brochures. I'm signed up for classes at my community college, but that isn't enough for her.

Over the family vacation we didn't have enough room for all of us in the camper, so I slept in the car. I lived out of an adidas bag that I kept in the camper. She went through my clothes and decided which ones I was allowed to keep for the trip. She left mainly summer clothes, and we were heading up to Maine and Canada. She sent them home through the post office when we hit Boston, while I was asleep. 

Today, she started yelling at me because she thinks I'm useless. All because I asked her to warn me when she was vacuuming behind me. She never asked for help, or I would have. Instead, she goes on a rant about how I am a useless lazy piece of shit who has zero respect for her. I left the room because I was so shocked. A couple hours later I decided I wanted to take my dog to the dog park and I couldn't find my keys. I looked for them for half an hour before I went and asked her. She hid them in our mixing bowls in their liquor cabinet. My wallet and the keys to the car I paid for myself. She had no right. 

She also told me I was getting fat in front of my friends. 

I just don't get why she doesn't love me, or what I did to be the one she picks on.
