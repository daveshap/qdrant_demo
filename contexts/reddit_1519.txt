I went on a date today!
I’m so proud of myself. I met a guy online and actually took the initiative to get out of bed, face my anxiety and meet a new person. (it paid off so well and i had a great time!) 

A year ago or even a few months ago there’s NO WAY I would’ve been able to do it but I’m slowly improving and i’m so proud of myself! 

Sorry if this isn’t appropriate to post, mods remove it if it doesn’t fit here :)
