BACON: What's that?
SAMOAN JO: A cocktail, you asked for a cocktail.
BACON: No, I asked you to give me a refreshing drink. I wasn't expecting a fucking rainforest; you could fall in love with an orang-utan in that.
SAMOAN JO: You want a pint, go to the pub.
BACON: I thought this was a pub.
SAMOAN JO: It's a Samoan pub.
BACON: Well whatever it is, could you get your man to turn the TV down?
SAMOAN JO: You ask him if you like, but I would leave him to it if I was you.
