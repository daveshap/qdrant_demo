Fired from corporate job after 3 months without warning or reason. Was unemployed for 6mo prior. Where to go from here?
I left the restaurant industry in late 2018 due to the effect it was having on my body and the long hours. Was able to collect unemployment and found work for a corporate restaurant chain after about 6 months. I worked there for 3 months with great performance reviews from my trainers through out. 

Then this week I get an urgent call from my senior asking if I can rearrange my schedule ( work in the field and make our own schedule) to come in to the office for a meeting. 

At the meeting my senior isn't there but the 2 heads of operations there and just say "it's not working out, here's your final check" etc

I ask why and they cannot give me a solid reason out side of not a good fit. 

My exit interview form says "discharged" not "laid off" but does not list a reason. As this was my introductory period and an at-will non contract position I understand they have this right. 

Now I do not wish put this short 3mo job on my resume, especially since it ended in getting "discharged."

I'm thinking of enrolling in a certificate course at my local university so it at least seems like I'm doing something with my life currently. 

I also have a 1099 gig on the side that can help fill my employment gap but it's still well over 6mo with nothing listed. 

What should I do from here with my resume and applications? How would you handle yourself in this situation?

I have about 5k saved up from this job. Luckily didn't touch my paychecks outside of bills. Maybe a 3month emergency fund.
