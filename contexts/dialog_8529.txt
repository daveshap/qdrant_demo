THREEPIO: So much has happened during the period of your indisposition, sir.
LEIA: I'll be back later.
LUKE: Leia ... What would you think if I went away for a while?
LEIA: What did you say?!
LEIA: Where are you going?
LUKE: I have this ... feeling. I'm not sure, really ...
LEIA: That's just great. Why doesn't everyone just take off?

LEIA: First Han, now you. When am I going to learn not to count on anyone but myself? ...
LUKE: Han's leaving?
LUKE: Calm down, will ya? Tell me about Han.
LEIA: He wants to pay off that criminal he's in hock to.
LUKE: Jabba the Hutt?
LEIA: I could get more loyalty if I went down the hall and recruited some of those snow creatures.
LUKE: Snow creatures ... they're here?!
