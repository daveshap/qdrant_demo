JENNIFER: Symptoms include loss of emotional control, compulsive behavior, cravings, crying spells...
FRIDA: Peter keeps asking me out.
JENNIFER: Maybe you should go out with him. If you keep avoiding him he'll get suspicious. Besides, what better way to not get busted than to date the cop who's investigating you.
FRIDA: The thing is, I really like him. I finally meet a guy I really like and I'm a fuckin' werewolf.
JENNIFER: We don't know you're a werewolf. It might never happen again. You have to get on with your life.
