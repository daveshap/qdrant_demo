17 yo daughter lost father to heroine OD. Left with one angry kid who hates me and one who doesn’t even understand what’s going on. I can’t even mourn bc I lost my job trying to tend to my oldest’s mental needs and I just can’t see past the bills. So mad at him for doing this to us, to the kids
Was told I should post here too. Sorry if not appropriate forum.  Throwaway account: It’s long.  Im so sorry... A month ago, I lost a lucrative job in nursing. Lucrative For nursing yes - but we still lived paycheck to paycheck and I rent a expensive home that looks dilapidated with an unresponsive landlord and a city that allows it. I’m a nurse by trade. Most hear that and think, oh she’s well to do. I’m a single mom of two kids and student loans out the wazoo. And I only recently began making decent money. Prior to that we barely got by. Prior to losing my job, my biggest issue began with my 17 yo daughter and the passing of her dad. Our son is too young to care, he’s only 4. And dad was minimally involved with him anyhow. He wasn’t much more involved with my daughter either. But that doesn’t matter. He was their father. And he was on a pedestal. No matter how little he did for her or how many times he lied, stood her up, or broke her heart. He had been an opioid addict on and off the last 12 years. We were married but very quickly estranged bc of the drug use. I would not enable him. His family and my own daughter blames me for that now bc “if you had stuck with him love would have gotten him through and he wouldn’t be dead now”, etc. That’s one of the nicer things that’s been said. He went through multiple rehab attempts (20+). The night he passed, he had left rehab after for the first time ever completing the program. He was clean. But we didn’t know this. She didn’t know this. She knew his past behavior. And I never ever spoke an ill word against him. She was old enough to see him for herself. I never had to. I would simply say things like well, he is your father and he does deserve a certain degree of respect and would leave it at that. He reached out to her the night of completing rehab (for his annual bs story in her eyes) by FB messenger saying “hey baby girl, I’m clean again, and I love you. I want to see you.”  She responded (like I believe any child would) angry and not believing what she’s heard and not seen her whole life. She told him exactly this “I don’t believe you one bit. I hate you for what you’ve done to me. A child is supposed to have their father especially a daughter. I needed you and you weren’t there and you never will be. It’s only a matter of time before that needle’s back in your arm and I don’t matter anymore. Like usual. My whole life Shawn. [she never called him dad] You don’t love me. You don’t even love yourself.”  And that was their last exchange. And I tell her time and time again she was and still is entitled to her anger and to feel the way she feels. But it only encourages the guilt. He was found the next morning with a needle in his arm. She blames herself wholeheartedly for his death. She literally feels as though she injected him herself. She’s had MULTIPLE stays at a psychiatric hospital as she’s cutting and using drugs, marijuana, pills, hallucinogens, and I’m sure more that’s just what she’s confessed to or have found. Using in my home. Ruining her future. Smoking cigarettes. Failing her courses. (A previous honor student obtaining college credits with plans to graduate early but that is no longer the case). No longer participating in extracurricular activities she previously adored. Volunteering. Lying. Hanging with the wrong crowd. Cutting school. You name it. Following the loss of her dad, her Grandparents have given her two old first time cars (not at the same time and not same grandparents, were all poor lol) thinking that would help improve her spirits. The first car given her, she totaled on ice and had to be cut out with the jaws of life after hitting a steel pylon. The second, an SUV that she also wrecked but this wasn’t her fault. She was T boned. She feels like she has nothing and everything she gets, people and material things, don’t last. Breaks my heart. I know she’s mad. We’ve seen multiple counselors, therapists, psychiatrists, and psychologists. Weve medicated her with things I’ve never even heard or as a nurse for over a decade. And I will be the first to be against meditating a marrying brain. She’s attempted studies three times now. We’ve gone to teen group loss sessions, but no one understands what she’s going through. We can’t even talk without her screaming at me. 😢 And we still have no diagnosis. I feel this is deeper than the loss of her dad and maybe the stimulus that has exacerbated the mental illness? But without a job and income I can’t afford her meds or multiple appointments. I applied for medical card and was DENIED. I’m at a loss and have fourteen more days of medications (not that they’re helping they much lol) left before all hell breaks loose. 

I’m 34 years old. I’m a nurse. I’ve been a nurse for 12 years. I should have it together better than I do but I don’t. I don’t even own my home. My kids aren’t spoiled. We shop at yard sales and Goodwill or Salvation Army. My lucrative job paid additional toward my $60k student loans. While employed I carried minimal essential coverage which covers none of what she’s going through or needs. The cars had liability only and were complete losses. Her hospital bills, appts, and meds I can’t even fathom into my budget. Even to make payments! Her insurance bills I can’t even come close to paying. I can barely afford our rent and it’s more than that. My credit sucks yet I pay my bills. My student loans are equivalent to my rent. I’m a good nurse, I don’t even play cards!! (Sorry has to break the tension a little lol) I love my patients genuinely and I take care of them as tho they’re my own favorite relative and I expect nothing less from my staff. I had been employed for 12 years at the same facility and upon an ownership change I was let go. Out of the blue. We didn’t even know we were for sale and I was director of nursing. No severance. Nothing. My heart breaks for my kids but I feel so selfish for worrying so much about finances and can’t see past the bulls to mourn the loss with my kids. I literally don’t know what to do. I’ve had several interviews but remain “overqualified” for a nursing position I can obtain quickly. But time is of the essence. My late husband worked under the table when he worked. Otherwise he was a drug dealer. So social security isn’t even an option. I’ve never felt so lost and hopeless before. Any advice that can be give would be much appreciated. Thanks for sticking with my rant. Feels better just to have put it all down and gotten it out. Just need some advice and an ear to bend. Thanks again, Reddit friends.
PS: And why do I feel so jealous that I’ve done it all for them both and she puts him on a pedestal and treats me like crap all the time?!? Am I really that selfish? The way she tells me she hates me I can’t imagine her missing me like she misses him and it makes me mad, sad, jealous, and hurt all at the same time. How can I get over this and get back on top? Or at least week to week?
