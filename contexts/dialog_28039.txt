MAX: You've got a generous nature. I like that in a person. My name is Max.
LUCY: Lucy.
MAX: So what can I help you find tonight, Lucy? We've got it all. Best selection in Santa Carla.
LUCY: I'm not looking for a tape. What I need is --
MAX: -- a job.
LUCY: Do I look that needy?
SAM: Where are we going?
MICHAEL: Nowhere.
SAM: Then what's the rush? You're chasing that girl, why don't you just admit it? I'm at the mercy of your sex glands!
MICHAEL: Don't you have something better to do than follow me around all night?
