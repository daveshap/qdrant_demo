Just a rant
There’s this guy I work with, he earns £45000+ which is way above the average UK salary, works four on four off , gets 35 working days holiday per year (Americans don’t know this feel) (which means he works about 4.5 months of the year). 

He is in his early 40’s, is a supervisor, lives 3 miles from work and ASKS ME, a part time early 20’s making next to nothing for motivation to start work everyday.

Some people really have no perspective on life.

One day I’m going to snap and say how about you lose your job, can’t pay your mortgage, can’t feed your family, become homeless. HOWS THAT FOR MOTIVATION you imbecile.
