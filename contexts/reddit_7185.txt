First office job, is training normally this poor?
The people mentoring me blazed through the processes, it was like they were talking to themselves. They told me to write down everything they said. Their mouths struggled to keep up with how fast they were thinking so I was writing furiously for several hours, phrases they nonchalantly mentioned turned out to be critical to understanding what I was supposed to be doing, I only found this out by making them stop and asking what 'SDAQ' meant, i had to stop them every minute for stuff like this, it was ridiculous.

Im left with dozens of pages of disorganized notes, because each time they went through it again I picked up on more and more stuff to add. This made it complicated to organise the steps of each process, and theres a LOT of them.

A few days later I was left to my devices to do what they trained me on, these excel processes take a few hours (there was only 2 run throughs for my training, and that was watching someone), and ask for help if needed. I ended up making a few costly errors.

Im coming to the end of my second week, the assistant manager spoke to me and said she has clearly piled way too much on to me and that im not where i should be.
