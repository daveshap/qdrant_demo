What are the pros and cons of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the way it's been managed by Director Richard Cordray
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was created in 2011 by Dodd-Frank, and was the brainchild of Elizabeth Warren. Ever since, it's apparently been a lightning rod for criticism, with that intensifying recently. I've found an editorial from the [Wall Street Journal opposing it](https://www.wsj.com/articles/consumer-financial-protection-racket-1461530729) and another one published days ago talking about [the fastest way to fire its director, Richard Cordray](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-fastest-way-to-fire-richard-cordray-1486511893). The New York Times, meanwhile, [published an editorial in support](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/28/opinion/sunday/hands-off-the-consumer-finance-bureau.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FConsumer%20Financial%20Protection%20Bureau&action=click&contentCollection=timestopics&region=stream&module=stream_unit&version=latest&contentPlacement=3&pgtype=collection&_r=0), while Texas Republican Jeb Hensarling has [urged Trump to fire Cordray as soon as possible](http://www.mpamag.com/news/hensarling-trump-needs-to-fire-cordray-as-soon-as-possible-59656.aspx). 

From [it's Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_Financial_Protection_Bureau): 

>According to the United States Treasury Department, the bureau is tasked with the responsibility to "promote fairness and transparency for mortgages, credit cards, and other consumer financial products and services". According to its web site, the CFPB's "central mission...is to make markets for consumer financial products and services work for Americansâ€”whether they are applying for a mortgage, choosing among credit cards, or using any number of other consumer financial products".

My questions are:

1. What, more specifically, does this mean the CFPB actually does?

2. What is the opposition to the CFPB based on?

3. What evidence is there that the CFPB has been succeeding or failing in its mission so far?

4. How has Richard Cordray managed the agency?

Thank you all! Edit: I just realized I forgot a question mark in the title so just pretend that's there.
