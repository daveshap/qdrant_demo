MATTHEW: What happens if somebody comes in here right now and shoots you?
NICKY: This place becomes famous. Tour buses. Blind people feeling around for bullet holes in the wall.
TOYOTA: You see what you're doing, don't you?
NICKY: What am I doing?
TOYOTA: You're charming the boy.
NICKY: Hey, Toyota. He asked me a question.
TOYOTA: Frankie Lazzaro. Coming down the courthouse steps every day in the media. Children see this. They think you're the Secretary of the Treasury.
NICKY: That's my cousin, Angelo.
JACK: This could be it.
PETER: This could be it.
JACK: This could be it.
PETER: This could be it.
JACK: Does it feel comfortable?
PETER: Does what feel comfortable?
JACK: This could be it.
PETER: This could be it.
MATTHEW: What's it like to shoot somebody?
NICKY: I respect a kid who does his homework in a taxi. But let's put a lid on the questions.
TOYOTA: Go on, tell him. Tell the truth. Tell him how you feel, shooting a piece of hot metal in somebody's flesh who was once a child, who was once the same age as this boy. Somebody's flesh who was innocent once.
NICKY: It's complicated. It's a whole life. A person doesn't commit an act of violence out of nowhere. There are strong forces at work.
