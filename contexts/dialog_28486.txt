MIMI: Don't mind what she says, Chris.
JORGENSEN: How can I help but mind? I'm constantly humiliated... just because I haven't money.
MIMI: I'll get some.
JORGENSEN: You've said that for weeks.
MIMI: I know.
JORGENSEN: Why don't you go to see Julia? She handles his money.
MIMI: Chris!
JORGENSEN: All right. All right.
MIMI: I couldn't go near that woman.
JORGENSEN: I said all right!
MIMI: What are you going to do?
JORGENSEN: Just what I said I'd do.
MIMI: You wouldn't do that... you wouldn't!
JORGENSEN: Wouldn't I. Just watch me.
MIMI: Chris -- Chris -- !
