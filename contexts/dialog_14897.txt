LOU: Dave, I always play square. No bugs. I'd love you to go on the record, but Im in no hurry. Whenever you're ready."
FERRIE: I don't have much time. They don't even need bugs anymore. They got these fuckin' satellite waves. They put a bug in a friend of mine when he was born, right up his nostrils, subcutaneous, between his eyes. He was one of those products of a crossbreading experiment. A Nazi rocket scientist father and a Commie spy mother. You'd never believe half the shit the Agency does. I'm so fuckin' tired. Haven't slept since that shit article came out. Why'd you guys have to go and get me involved with this?
LOU: Did we involve you, Dave, or did Clay Shaw?
FERRIE: That cocksuckin' faggot! He's got me by the balls.
LOU: What do you mean?
FERRIE: Photographs - compromising stuff. And he'll use 'em. The Agency plays for keeps... I knew Oswald. He was in my Civil Air Patrol unit. I taught him everything. A wanna be
JIM: Let me get this straight, now. Clay Shaw is blackmailing you?
FERRIE: Fuckin' A. How do you think the Agency gets people to do their bullshit? Fuck knows what they got on Oswald!
