Anyone have recommendations for programs/websites to track sources with APA 7th ed. citation style?
Hey folks - sorry if this question has already come up but I am looking for the *latest* suggestions since the program I *was* using to keep track of my cited sources in my papers does not yet have the updated APA edition (7th edition) that came out just this past October. I'm specifically looking for a program that includes APA 7th edition style and is Windows/Microsoft Office compatible. I would prefer something free but I'll consider putting money into something to keep track of my sources because doing it by hand is simply too time consuming!  


Side note: I was just using the Microsoft Word to manage my sources! (I found this to be the most convenient method since I use Microsoft Word to write my papers as well). However, it appears my Microsoft Word still only supports APA 6th edition. I don't know if there was an update to address this, but as it stands I'm looking for alternatives!
