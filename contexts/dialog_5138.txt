HUNTER: Evan, you're hysterical. You study for this?
EVAN: We'll find out soon enough.
HUNTER: Me neither.
EVAN: You're kidding. Are these the answers?!
HUNTER: Damn, Evan, on the D.L.
EVAN: Thanks. Wow. Hey, I want to do something really special for Kayleigh tomorrow. If I said I needed some help from you and the brothers...
HUNTER: I'd say blow me. Get the pledges to do it.
KAYLEIGH: Oh my God, that was good. Where'd you learn all those new tricks?
EVAN: So it didn't feel... weird?
KAYLEIGH: Yeah, if you call multiple orgasms weird.
