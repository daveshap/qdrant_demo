What is the worth of a Business Administration degree in the job market? Is it worth it or should I choose a more specialized degree like marketing or finance?
Especially with everything thats been going on I’m not sure if it’s worth it committing to loans that might screw me over later if I can’t find a job. Anyone with any personal experience or advice would be greatly appreciated.
