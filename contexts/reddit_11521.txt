I'm really really lonely
I just feel very very alone. I have a friend who I am very close to. I love her like a sister. She claims to love me too. She also claims that I'm her best friend. But she never talks to me in person. Whenever we have an opportunity, she always prefers to talk to someone else.
She talks to me regularly through the phone though.
Despite having brought this up several times with her, and her saying that she will change, she never does.
I trust her a lot. But I feel so... Alone. I don't have anybody else in my life to talk to.

Thank you, whoever spent their valuable time reading this.
