MRS. ROBINSON: Is there an ashtray in here?
BEN: No.
MRS. ROBINSON: Oh -- I forgot. The track star doesn't smoke.
MRS. ROBINSON: Is it a girl?
BEN: Is what a girl?
MRS. ROBINSON: Whatever it is you're upset about.
BEN: Oh -- no. I'm just sort of disturbed about things.
MRS. ROBINSON: In general.
BEN: That's right.
MRS. ROBINSON: Benjamin, I want to ask you something.
BEN: What?
MRS. ROBINSON: Will you take me home?
BEN: What?
MRS. ROBINSON: My husband took the car. Will you drive me home?
