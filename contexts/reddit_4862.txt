Thick thighs and heavy sighs
My first post. 
I am incredibly depressed and have been for almost six months now. I recently moved and every time something goes wrong I can only feel like I've f*cked up my life completely and want to disappear. I can't go home, but being in this new place feels like death. I never seem to be able to make the right decision. My SO and my family love me, but I can feel my pain only making it more difficult for them. I love them so much and dont want to keep burdening the people who I care about most with my crippling depression. 
I have been to counseling, but because of a traumatic experience in my youth, placing myself in the dynamic of trusting someone when then proved to be not the safe place they were supposed to be, this is not really an option. 
So hello internet. I exist. I love my family. I just hate myself.
