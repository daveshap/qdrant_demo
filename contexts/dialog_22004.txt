KITTLE: You're Zimmermann's calculator, Archie. All the blood money you had to move around to make this deal, you got to know something. Maybe they told you, maybe you overheard things you weren't supposed to hear...
ARCHIE: I'm telling you, you're barking up the wrong tree.
KITTLE: Well, I'm running out of trees, so look me in the eye like a man and tell me you don't know! Convince me!
ARCHIE: I don't know. Fuck off!
NENA: You suck at lying, Archie.
KITTLE: See... now that we know you know, the hard part's done for us.
NENA: It's just a question of how long do we have to slap you silly till you spill the beans.
