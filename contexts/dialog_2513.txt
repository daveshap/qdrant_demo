BRIAN: I'm close... but I can't get who it is...
RONALD: So you came to me... Well, this is going to be an interesting afternoon after all...
RONALD: Okay, here's the deal. I'll tell you a story, you tell me one. Fair?
BRIAN: Who's doing this?
RONALD: Your first question should be who isn't. It isn't a spark, Brian. Not enough damage. And an insurance pro? Where's the profit margin?
BRIAN: Then who --
RONALD: -- No no, your turn. Tell me a story.
BRIAN: I don't have a story.
RONALD: Sure you do.
RONALD: Famous story even. Straight burn. Just an engine and truck first on scene. What did you feel, Brian, when you first got there?
BRIAN: What?
RONALD: You gotta tell a story too, Brian. It's fair. C'mon, don't think too hard --
BRIAN: I... I thought it was great. I loved it. It was nothing to these guys... medium deal.
RONALD: Right. Light smoke, low roll. Couple'a civilians hollering -- medium deal. So young fireman Adcox and Captain McCaffrey, they head up stairs, get out on the fire escape -- McCaffrey does the ballsy jump across... what were you feeling, Brian? C'mon, you promised. Be honest. Okay... Guard!
BRIAN: -- I wanted to be him. Right then I wanted to be him more than anything...
RONALD: Very good, Brian. -- About your report here. The way to a torch's heart is through his tools. That's how you know him. It's the way he talks to the fire. And to you if you listen.
BRIAN: The outlets.
RONALD: That's a probie answer. You're smarter than that, Brian.
BRIAN: Trychticholorate.
RONALD: Good. -- So our two heroes, Adcox and McCaffrey, they go back inside. Only there's another fire in there nobody sees. And it took your dad, didn't it Brian? Did you see him burn?
BRIAN: Who the fuck is doing this?
RONALD: After it took your dad... the fire... did it look at you Brian? Did it talk to you?...
