funny when they say "suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem"
when all your existing is the problem in the first place 
when  life is just one big pain in the ass

to me personally i feel like everything is just a big waste of time ...this life is just not good enough not fullfilling enough
its so cold and boring and so so tiring
it's really dreadful 


some people do have temporary problems ...but the others have problems that wont be fixed 
like loss of a loved one or someone you love cheat on you or leave you alone

(( some people can't really get over these tramatic events happend to them not everyone can "heal" magically))
and like depression too...(some people tried EVERTHING to overcome depression but they failed)

so please stop saying that Really stupid thing to others who is at the edge of their lives
it will only make them feel more gulit and shame then they already do

(no hate in the comments thats only my opinion) 

EDIT : HOLY SHIT OMG thanks for all of you commenting on this post...it got attention really fast lol i gusse im not the only one feeling this way huh...
