MARGO: No! Don't kill him! Pendergast, you were right. It's John!
PENDERGAST: What?
MARGO: That thing is John Whittlesley. I should have seen it before! The fibers are infected with a virus. You eat them, and the virus alters your DNA! He became addicted to them in South America, followed the plants back to the states. He probably entered the country as a man. It would have taken several months for the change to take place. That's how he got from the boat to the museum!
PENDERGAST: I don't believe it.
MARGO: You have to! Listen! All viruses pass on their own DNA. Instruct the cells of the host to make more viruses! This one was different. It inserted a whole array of genes into John. Reptile genes, sixty five million years old. Those genes remade him! It's not his fault!
PENDERGAST: Whatever that thing is, we have to kill it!
