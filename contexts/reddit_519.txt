My parents might get divorced
So my parents have been fighting for probably three or four years. Before it was because my mom thought he was flirting with other people and for a time, he left the house at night and didn’t come home till one or two in the morning. He also drinks every night. I don’t think he’s an alcoholic or anything but he drinks a little beer or wine every single day. Then my dad got sick. Life threateningly sick. And through that my mom stayed by him. During his recovery, they were on good terms and I thought things were getting better. But then my brother, who is in middle school right now, started being so rude. Every day my parents would be so stressed out because of him. He was talking back and wasn’t helping around the house. He was so incredibly rude. They told me hey were getting divorced three times already over the past four years. And now my brother is stressing them out. Recently, my brother was being really messy and my parents were yelling at him to clean up. But he didn’t. After thirty minutes he still didn’t. That’s when my dad got mad. But my mom is always on my brothers side. She said that’s he’s going through a stage. But my dad didn’t agree. So he left. He went to my relative’s house. And he said he’s not coming back to our house unless my mom goes. It’s either him or her. I think this time they’re actually getting divorced. And I really don’t want that to happen. I’m in high school so I’m going to be applying to college soon. I know financially we are going to be strained. And I don’t want to move between houses. We’ve been living in our house for half of my life. I love my neighborhood so much it’s beautiful and safe. We’re not rich, but we’re well off. I don’t know what to do. I hate crying when I hear them fighting, but I love having a family that isn’t broken apart.
