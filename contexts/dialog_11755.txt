ROBERT: I thought you guys were going to call me.
ANNIE: Oh, Robert, I'm sorry. We were so tired from the branding. Grace barely made it to her bed and I didn't have the energy to take my clothes off.
ROBERT: Oh well... branding will do that to you.
ANNIE: Everything all right.
ROBERT: Huh-huh. You?
ANNIE: Fine. Actually, today was a good day. You should have seen her.
ROBERT: I wish I did.
ROBERT: Well, uh the real reason I called, actually, was to tell you I saw Lucy at Jo-Jo's tonight and she seems very worried.
ANNIE: About what?
ROBERT: Apparently, Gottschalk's been seen around town lunching with some very prominent magazine editors. Lucy said she tried to call you, but no one answered so she faxed you the list of names. She said one of them have contracts up fairly soon.
ANNIE: Oh. I didn't look at my faxes today. We left before sunrise.
ROBERT: Honey, I hope you're not endangering your position. Listen, if you need to come back and you want me to come take over, for a while, I'll work it out. I mean, the firm's got other lawyers, but the magazine's got only one of you.
ANNIE: I've decided it's impossible to properly say hello in this place without a hat.
TOM: A jogger, huh?
ANNIE: I don't jog, Mr. Booker. I run.
TOM: Lucky for you. The grizzlies around here only go for joggers.
ANNIE: If I can survive rush hour, I figure I can handle grizzlies...
TOM: You sleeping all right in that house?
ANNIE: I don't sleep all right anywhere. But the house is fine.
