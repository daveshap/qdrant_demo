INTERVIEWER: We should remind viewers that Truman, especially as a child, presented a challenge for the production.
CHRISTOF: Let me demonstrate some examples.
CHRISTOF: He was curious from birth - premature by two weeks, as if he couldn't wait to get started.
INTERVIEWER: Of course, his eagerness to leave his mother's womb also meant he was the one selected.
CHRISTOF: In competition with five other unwanted pregnancies - the casting of a show determined by an air date - he was the one who arrived on cue.
INTERVIEWER: Who knew that a show originally meant to last one year - Bringing Up Baby" - would turn into a "cradle to grave" concept. He is in fact the first child in the world to be legally adopted by a corporation."
CHRISTOF: That's correct.
INTERVIEWER: And the show now generates a yearly income equivalent to the gross national product of a small country.
CHRISTOF: People forget it takes the <i>population</i> of an entire country to keep the show running.
INTERVIEWER: No, of course not. And since the show runs 24 hours a day with no commercial breaks the staggering profits are all generated from product placement.
CHRISTOF: Yes, everything you see on the show is for sale - from the actors' wardrobe, food products, to the very homes they live in--
INTERVIEWER: All products carefully chosen and tested by you for quality and aesthetic value.
CHRISTOF: There's nothing on the show I don't use myself.
INTERVIEWER: And it's all available in the Truman" Show" catalogue. Operators are standing by."
INTERVIEWER: Why do you feel that Truman's never come close to discovering the true nature of his world?
CHRISTOF: We accept the reality of the world with which we're presented. As the show expanded, naturally we were forced to manufacture ways to keep Truman in Seahaven - demonstrating that every venture is accompanied by a risk.
