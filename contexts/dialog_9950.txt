JUSTINE: Yes. I took refuge in the barn. Wouldn't you? Lost in the storm? Freezing and wet? I was exhausted and could search no longer.
PROSECUTOR: And is it true, Miss Moritz, that you love Victor Frankenstein? That your heart was broken? Answer the question. Do you love Victor Frankenstein?
JUSTINE: I have always loved him.
PROSECUTOR: Is it also not true that you murdered his brother William in a misdirected crime of passion?
JUSTINE: Murder Willie? In my heart, he was our child. Victor's and mine. Such a thing could never have entered my mind.
PROSECUTOR: So you have claimed. Yet you have no explanation for this. The locket last seen in the hands of the poor murdered child was found hidden in your dress the morning following the murder. The locket you so coveted. How did it come to be in your possession?
JUSTINE: I have no knowledge of that.
