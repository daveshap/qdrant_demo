CHASE: Why do you do that?
BRUCE: What?
CHASE: Throw up that ridiculous superficial mask. If you're jealous...
BRUCE: I'm not-
CHASE: You want me close but you won't let me near. What's the terrible, dark secret you're protecting everyone from?
CHASE: In a sense we are all two people. The side we show in daylight. And that side we keep in shadow.
BRUCE: Rage. Anger. Passion. Pain.
ALFRED: Sorry to bother you, sir. I have some rather distressing news about Master Dick.
BRUCE: Is he all right?
ALFRED: I'm afraid Master Dick has... gone traveling.
BRUCE: He ran away?
ALFRED: Actually, he took the car.
BRUCE: He boosted the Jag? Is that all?
ALFRED: Not the Jaguar. The _other_ car.
BRUCE: The _Rolls_?
ALFRED: _No_, sir. _The_ _other_ _car_!
