I need urgent help just got fired from my first job out of college.
I graduated in mechanical engineering. I got hired for an entry level position as a project engineer at a company. I worked there for 4 weeks and I was never assigned one task besides a research project from a different department manager (design engineer manager). My project engineering manager from the first day only had me learn the company and that’s exactly what I did. I read all their books about their field of work and I gained a tremendous amount of information learning their business (plastics). However out of the blue today I got fired. I asked what for and HR and my manager simply said it was a business decision that we felt like you weren’t qualified enough or had a technical understanding that we would expect from an engineer. My manager only ever once mocked my engineering education because I didn’t know what a Socket shoulder cap screw, when he was showing me machine parts. 

The department I was working under sales department were all filled with boomers. All the employees including my manager with 50+ and most of them did not have degree’s just apprenticeships and got into the trade. I worked with 2 other young coworkers who had mechanical engineering degrees. One of Em was there since he interned and the other just decided a few days ago to quit to move onto another job. So the department I was working at is now 5/7 people in their office.

I’m so confused. What do I do? How will I find another job? Won’t other companies see that I got fired when doing a background check? I’m at a complete lost of words. I need to support myself and my parents and payback my student loans. I had other offers lined up and decided to take this one because it was close to home and the best decision for me.

Please help me any and all advice is very much appreciated I am only 21 years old and located at an At-Will State.
