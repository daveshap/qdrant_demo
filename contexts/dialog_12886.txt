CLIVE: What kind of war is this Mac? Up there in Cumberland, we never see an air-raid. The worst problem I have is getting a new typewriter ribbon. When I rode in against the Turks, I knew what it was about.
MAC: Did you? You thought you did. We've been gypsed, all our lives. Look at your street.
CLIVE: What about it?
MAC: Rosehill Avenue. No roses. No hill. And it's certainly not an avenue.
CLIVE: Why not?
MAC: You need trees for an avenue.
CLIVE: There was talk of planting some when we first came.
MAC: Propaganda. We've been had.
CLIVE: How's your war, Mac?
MAC: Never done better. On the fiddle. Like everyone else.
CLIVE: Except the servicemen.
MAC: Naturally.
CLIVE: I don't understand. Is there any point to it?
MAC: There is all right. This Hitter fellow. We've got to winkle him out. And get shot of some of our lot at the same time.
