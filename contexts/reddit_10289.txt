killing myself on jan 1st 2020
my parents found out i have depression, now my mom is treating me differently while my dad takes on a more gentler and understanding approach. My mom is guilt tripping me and telling me to kill myself, she wouldn't care she said. So I was deeply hurt, I recently purchased a rope 2 hours ago online. I'm planning to write goodbye letters next to my ex-boyfriend who I always loved, my friend who I drifted apart with but our memories together haunts me, my best friends who stuck around me and helped me get better, which vainly failed. And of course, my dad, I love my dad very much. I already wrote a will 2 months ago. I told my classmates about my plan, and they all tried their best to make me feel better. I love them so much, but if I have to endure the pain everyday at home being discriminated and bullied by my mom... I just can't...

Honestly, fuck 2019.

thank you for the people who showed concern, it made me rethink if i want to go through it or not. I just feel this way because everyday feels like hell and why even bother going on if everyone around you, including your old friends are happy.
