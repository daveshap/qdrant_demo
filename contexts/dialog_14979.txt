JUNO: Whoah. I don't want to see pictures. I don't need to be notified of anything. Can't we just kick it old school? I could just put the baby in a basket and send it your way. You know, like Moses in the reeds.
MARK: Technically, that would be kickin' it Old Testament.
JUNO: Yeah. Yeah! The way people used to do it. Quick and dirty, like ripping off a Band-Aid.
GERTA: Well, then we agree a traditional closed adoption would be best for all involved, then?
JUNO: Shit, yeah. Close it up.
MARK: Obviously, we'll compensate you for your medical expenses.
VANESSA: Are you looking for any other compensation?
MAC: Excuse me?
JUNO: Well, no... I'm not going to sell the baby. I just want it to grow up with people who are ready to love it and be parents. I'm in high school, dude. I'm ill-equipped.
VANESSA: You're doing an amazing and selfless thing for us.
MARK: Vanessa has wanted a baby since we got married.
VANESSA: I want to be a mommy so badly!
MAC: You don't say.
VANESSA: Well, haven't you ever felt like you were born to do something?
MAC: Yes. Heating and air conditioning.
VANESSA: Well, I was born to be a mother. Some of us are.
