Please take things slow.
No matter how much you like this person, no matter how much you feel they might be the one, take things slow - including sex - truth is you’re so in love it blurs your mental clarity and you make dumb decisions. And you dont see it until after it all crashes and burns. Maybe things wouldnt have worked out anyways but I would rather feel like I did all the right things than feel like I rushed into it and ruined a potentially good relationship. It will be worth it. Either you realize you’re not right for each other before you make any commitments and get more attached or it works out and you’re even more sure its the right person. I know there’s people who get married 2 months after meeting and they’re together for ever but more likely than not that is not going to happen.
