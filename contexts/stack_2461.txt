Creating new field with values from different fields QGIS I have combined different layers (vector) in a merged layer. All layers had one specific land-use type, so now the new layer has fields called 'tree', 'paved', 'building', 'water' and 'plants'. All these fields either have value 1 or 0. (1 for when this feature has the specific land use and 0 if it doesn't). This means that all features only have one '1' (either in tree, paved, building, water or plants). The other of those fields will then just have 0. Now I want to add those fields to a new field, so that this field has the type of land cover for each feature, (combine type of land cover into one field basically).How do I do this?
