What should I look for in footwear for walking long distances in mostly urban areas while carrying a heavy backpack? I want to start looking for the footwear for my next world hitchhiking trip.On my last two trips I got name brand hiking shoes (Kathmandu and Merrell) but the soles wore out before each trip was up.I'm not asking for specific brands or models, just what kinds of materials, specs, or characteristics to look for. (Though \"durable soles\" is not an easy trait to Google for.)I will only take one pair of shoes. As a hitchhiker I can cover up to 30 km in a day carrying 15kg or more. Hiking shoes are designed for use mostly on natural surfaces and use on asphalt and concrete causes them to wear more quickly.I used to wear normal sneakers/trainers but moved up to hiking shoes for the extra support for the times I was on rougher terrain with a backpack where I'd injured tendons before.Is there even a class of footwear suitable for my needs?
