How can I start my own business doing osha training?
I have 10 yrs combined construction and safety experience in comercial, residential, power plants, refineries. I’m bilingual English/Spanish working as a safety Manager currently, have my osha 30/510/ working on my 500  but I’m wanting to start my own business as a safety trainer. Anybody have any ideas how to or where to start or what path to take.
