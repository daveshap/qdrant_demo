short on my till
today, for the first time in the whole year and a half that i’ve been working there, i was short 54 dollars on my till. i think that was because a lady wanted 50 dollars change in toonies & loonies but i only had a large amount of 5 dollar bills. i offered the 50 in 5’s and i think she must have taken it without giving me the 50 dollar bill because that is the only possible way i could have been short. i don’t understand how careless i was to not make sure i had that 50 dollars back but this is the second time in two weeks i’ve gotten in trouble and now i’m scared that this was the last straw.
