PRESIDENT MUFFLEY: Yes?
AMBASSADOR DE SADE: Allow me to assure you that my government will not be satisfied with a polite note of regret for this shocking example of aggression against our peace-loving people.
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY: Damn you, de Sade! You know as well as I do that this was the act of a mentally sick man - a single individual, whose crack-up can probably be traced to the strains and tensions caused by your country.
AMBASSADOR DE SADE: It is very convenient to place all the blame on a dead man.
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY: How dare you talk to me in this manner?
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY: This dreadful accident could never have happened if your government hadn't cynically and hypocritic- ally blocked every proposal we made for disarmament or arms control!!
AMBASSADOR DE SADE: Bah! All you wanted to do was spy in our country!
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY: That's nonsense, and you know it!
AMBASSADOR DE SADE: I know nothing of the sort!
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY: Surely, you don't expect us to destroy our weapons without being able to verify that you are doing the same?
AMBASSADOR DE SADE: And surely you don't expect us to let you spy in our country before you destroy your weapons.
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY: Don't you realize that despite your incredible distrust and suspicion, that in fact, you place a far greater trust in us than inspection would require? You trust us not to cause a war accidentally - and, of course, we are obliged to place the same trust in you.
