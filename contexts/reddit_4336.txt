If you don’t have the energy to do something, try taking a micro-step
Many people with depression obviously lack energy, ambition and motivation. Thinking about accomplishing large tasks can trigger anxiety, which causes depression, which causes anxiety, and so on. It’s counter productive to think about the large task you have to do.

A solution I found helpful for this problem is to take micro steps. Just do the tiniest step you can towards that goal you have, and don’t be embarrassed by how small it is.

For instance, if you want to lose weight, exercising is an obvious goal, but it can sound so painful and atrocious that you simply refuse to do it. On the other hand, you could effortlessly do a single push-up (or whatever exercise is effortless for you) at this moment. *boop.* It is done. You did it. It took 3 seconds. It didn’t hurt. 

You may be thinking, “oh wonderful, now I’ve done a push up, I’m still nowhere near my goal of losing 50 pounds!” Yet, what I’ve found with micro-steps is they build momentum: 

- Even if I only do one push-up, I’m better off than where I just was. 

- Then, upon realizing one push-up was so easy yesterday, I can do another push-up tomorrow. It is still extremely easy. 

- Then I do one push-up every day for a week. It’s still extremely easy. 

- Then I do TWO pushups every day for a week. Still extremely easy. And hey 14 pushups a week ain’t too shabby. 

- Then I decide I’m going to add one more push-up every day of the week (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7). It’s still easy. It’s just *one more* than I *yesterday*, which was easy. 

- then I do this for two weeks (14 push-ups at the end). I reach day 14 and while it’s no longer as easy as one push-up, it’s something I’m proud of now and I don’t want to break my streak. I’m doing hundreds of pushups a month now.. I hadn’t done a single push-up in years before this started. It’s still nowhere near as hard as I originally imagined. It hurts for a minute, then I get a body high. It’s enjoyable overall. Wow, I see why people like this! Unbelievable. People are complimenting me for looking healthier. Unbelievable. I feel healthier. Cant stop this now, it’s working!

- then, a few months later I do this for 3 weeks

- then 4 weeks..

- and so on... 

I repeated this pattern and I’m currently up to doing 150 pushups 3x per week. I put on a podcast and take my time and don’t even think twice about it. It’s mildly annoying and then it feels great when I’m down. 

I have the strength to do 150 pushups a day now because I wasn’t ashamed to do that one pushup 5 years ago. If I hadn’t done that one push-up, I probably would have never done *anything*. Taking the tiny micro step of manifesting your goals can build momentum that you desperately need when you’re in a depression funk. Without any momentum you feel like there is no purpose. You are like a flower blocked from the sun. But even a small amount of sunlight can change everything, causing you to grow into places where you can effortlessly reach more sunlight. 

This also works for tasks you have to get done in the short term. Have a paper due tomorrow? First thing in the morning, just open up Microsoft word. You’ll think “well that was easy, I took the first step.” Then you will consider how hard the second step is: a title. Not hard. Now you’ve done something. And it’s only 7am. I’ll take an hour break and then write some outlines... then I’ll write a sentence. ..Then a paragraph... this is actually not so bad... 

once you take that first step of that opening Microsoft word, things stop seeming so daunting. Everything gets put into better perspective when you manifest your thoughts into actions, even in the most microscopically small way.
