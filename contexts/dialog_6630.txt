LETTY: What is it? Are you OK?
MICHAEL: Always the drugs.
LETTY: What?
MICHAEL: I saw you talking to my Mom.
LETTY: We both talked to her, Michael. And your dad.
LETTY: What do you mean not taking your meds?
MICHAEL: Why'd you tell?
LETTY: I didn't talk to her about medications, Michael. Don't be silly.
MICHAEL: Silly? Silly am I?
LETTY: Michael, take it easy.
MICHAEL: Silly, silly, silly.
LETTY: I think I should call someone.
MICHAEL: Don't upset my Mom. Don't you upset my Mom.
LETTY: Michael, calm down. Please. It's OK.
