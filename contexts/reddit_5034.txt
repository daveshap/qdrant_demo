Got rejected after being led on, encouraged me to apply again in the future and that they would even reach out with opportunities. How likely is this?
About a month after my second interview (with a small state office within a larger division) I got rejected. Before they rejected me they send me 3 emails telling me to wait a little longer hr was taking long (this was unprompted). They called me personally to tell me they loved me but they went with another candidate. The hiring manager said if her spot opens up (she’s going for a promotion) she would love if I applied and that she would send me opportunities. 

I may be just be feeling defeated with what’s going on. I was told something similar at my current job when interviewing for a different division. Then I rode in the elevator with the man who interviewed me, pressed the button for his floor and he asked how I knew....and I said “I interviewed in your office a week and a half ago....” I work for a big federal agency and have been told by employees that changing divisions is practically impossible (management has told me the opposite). So I’m interested to hear if positive rejections ever amount to anything, obviously am still looking but sick of hearing this.
