JOHN: I went to your place. We talked, just like you told me. We drove out into the desert . . .
JAKE: Is the job done?
JOHN: No.
JAKE: You didn't kill her?
JOHN: The time wasn't right.
JAKE: You're out in the desert, the middle of nowhere with no one around for miles, and you say the time wasn't right? What's the matter? You were hoping to get it on home video? A keepsake for the grandkids. Thank God I waited, or I never would have gotten it on tape.
JOHN: You know what I mean.
JAKE: I know all right. I know you're just enough of a shit to have a go at bedding a man's wife. You've probably bagged a few at that. You'd probably lie, cheat and steal without thinking twice. From that you'd just turn and walk away. But to kill; to get that blood on your hands. You can't wash that off. You'd be a marked man for life. Just like Cain. And you're a sinner who wants to walk with the saints. Ain't that right, boy?
JOHN: You know so much about killing why don't you do it yourself?
JAKE: I guess I have what you'd call a love-hate relationship with Grace.
JOHN: You love her, but you hate her?
JAKE: I hate loving her. I hate the kind of her person she is. I hate having to tolerate the little games she plays. I hate letting her use me. But I love her too much to do otherwise. And I certainly love her too much to kill her. I couldn't stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath, or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull. But you? You got the killing in you, boy.
JOHN: Shut up.
JAKE: Came close this time and it scares you.
JOHN: Drop it, Jake.
JAKE: And next time, next time somebody is going to get dead.
JOHN: SHUT UP!
