I spend a lot of money on “treat yourself” days and I am so glad.
I’m single and not earning a lot of money. I’m not fortunate to have a partner or spouse where I live in a household with dual incomes. But I spend about 70-80 dollars a month getting manicures and another 72 dollars for monthly massages. I’ve been doing this for almost two years now and sure that may be a “waste” of money, but I’m so much better at managing my stress and anxiety, which I owe partly to these choices I think.  I feel so relaxed with the massages and getting my nails done just makes me feel pretty. I have shit skin so my nails always look nice to make up for it (in my eyes).  I probably should better learn to budget and cut back in some other areas so that I can save more and eventually buy a house (that’s my goal now) but for now I’m so happy I splurge on this stuff. 

Also I’ve learned to not feel guilty about spending so much on these luxuries.  No good guilting myself for feeling good (ah the struggle of an anxious mind)
