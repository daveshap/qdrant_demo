DIANE: I don't see why not.
RENTON: Because it's illegal.
DIANE: Holding hands?
RENTON: No, not holding hands.
DIANE: In that case you can do it. You were quite happy to do a lot more last night.
RENTON: And that's what's illegal. Do you know what they do to people like me inside? They'd cut my balls off and flush them down the fucking toilet.
DIANE: Calm down. You're not going to jail.
RENTON: Easy for you to say.
DIANE: Can I see you again?
RENTON: Certainly not.
