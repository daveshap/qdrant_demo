EVAN: Third floor, spare bedroom, den, what have you. Mr. Pearlstine used it as an office.
LYDIA: He's talking about Bernard Pearlstine.
EVAN: Master bath.
LYDIA: The hotel guy? It's been in the papers lately. His kids are all suing each other over his estate. He was a total recluse, paranoid, rich as hell, he was worth thirty million or something, now it turns out they can't find half of it. Somebody took something didn't belong to them!
EVAN: I hardly see how family gossip is germane to showing the property.
LYDIA: Stop calling it the property, you sound ridiculous.
EVAN: Master closet.
EVAN: Could the child please stop that?
LYDIA: KID! NO ELEVATOR!
