APOLLO: I do -- Maybe what this fight needs is something new -- a novelty.
TRAINER: You's the novelty, Champ!
APOLLO: Give my main man a raise!!
APOLLO: Now here's what's goin' down. Listen, 'cause I'm gonna say this but one time. On January first, the first day of the Bicentennial I'm gonna fight me a local poor underdog, dig? A snow-white underdog. An' I'm gonna put his face on this poster with me, hear? An' I'll tell you why, 'cause I'm sentimental -- An' all the people in the country all sentimental, man, an' they'd like nothin' better than me, Apollo Creed, to let some unknown get a shot at the greatest title in the world on this country's biggest birthday. Now that's the way I see it an' that's the way I want it!!
JERGENS: ...It's very American.
APOLLO: No, man, it's very smart.
ROCKY: Next Wednesday I grab a grand from Snyder. An' Thursday two yards from Cappoli, okay?
GAZZO: No, two yards from Snyder, an' a grand from Cappoli.
ROCKY: Ya sure?
GAZZO: Hey, screw ya brain on right. Now, who's this girl you're going out with tonight?
ROCKY: How'd you know?
GAZZO: You think I don't hear things?
ROCKY: Paulie's sister.
BODYGUARD: Hear she's retarded.
ROCKY: She ain't retarded, she's shy.
BODYGUARD: Take 'er to the zoo -- Retards like the zoo.
ROCKY: Does that bum have to say that?
GAZZO: Buddy's in a bad mood -- prostate problems.
ROCKY: He's always in a bad mood. Count ya blessin's. Ya a healthy person -- ya legs work -- ya hands work --
BODYGUARD: I don't like ya face.
ROCKY: Don't like yours neither.
BODYGUARD: Kiss my ass.
ROCKY: Move your shoulders down.
GAZZO: Buddy's got a thing against ya, Rock. Some people just hate for no reason, y'know.
ROCKY: Yeah.
GAZZO: Here's fifty bucks -- You an' the girl have a nice time.
ROCKY: Thanks, Mr. Gazzo.
APOLLO: How 'bout this Billy Snow?
JERGENS: Fouls.
APOLLO: How 'bout this Big Chuck Smith?
TRAINER: Too old, dull fighter. Bobby Judge is a good boy.
APOLLO: ...I don't feel heat from the name.
JERGENS: Joe Zack is a good prospect -- Exciting boy.
APOLLO: ...Still don't feel no heat.
JERGENS: Exactly what are you looking for, Apollo?
APOLLO: ...This man.
APOLLO: 'The Italian Stallion' -- He's my man.
JERGENS: Rocky Balboa -- His record's poor --
APOLLO: Don't matter -- That name. 'The Italian Stallion,' it's right on. Who discovered America? An Italian, right? So, man, what could be better than to get it on with one of his ancestors --
TRAINER: He won't last one round.
APOLLO: Listen, I gonna carry this boy three rounds, then drop 'im like a bad habit.
TRAINER: I don't like you messin' with southpaws -- They do everything wrong.
APOLLO: Southpaw, nuthin' -- I'll drop 'im in three -- 'Apollo Creed meets the Italian Stallion.' Shhiii -- Sounds like a damn monster movie!!
ROCKY: I usta be deadly at half-ball.
PAULIE: I hate the friggin' game... I'd like to talk some business.
ROCKY: What kinda business?
PAULIE: Look at my hands -- See how the joints are swollen.
PAULIE: Inflamed joints -- Walkin' in an' out of a freezer carryin' meat plays hell on the joints.
ROCKY: Maybe ya should see a doctor.
PAULIE: I don't need a doctor, I need a different job.
ROCKY: Maybe another job is the best thing.
PAULIE: Do me a favor -- Talk to Gazzo. Tell him I'm a friend an' would do a good job... Tell him I ain't bothered by nothin' an' would be a great collector... Bustin' bones don't bother me -- Tell him I'm a good worker.
ROCKY: Gazzo's gotta come to you.
PAULIE: I'm askin' ya to go to him -- As a favor.
ROCKY: Gazzo's gotta come to you -- Hey, Paulie, it's a bad job -- Do what you do now.
