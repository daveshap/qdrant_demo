DREIBERG: Damn straight! We were heroes.
LAURIE: Of course, we looked like idiots in those bondage outfits.
DREIBERG: Well, that was Adrian's idea. I know he's the smartest man in the world and all that, but -- talk about publicity hounds . . .
LAURIE: Hey. You remember that nut in the hockey mask? With the asthma? What was his name . . .
DREIBERG: Oh yeah. The one that used to confess to everything? Hoping we'd beat him up?
LAURIE: That's the one. Whatever happened to him?
DREIBERG: He pulled it on Rorschach . . . and Rorschach dropped him down an elevator shaft.
