ANGELA: You're back.
NICK: Yeah.
ANGELA: I'm glad. Seriously... I'm very glad.
NICK: Angela, I just heard Sal was alive.
ANGELA: Sure. Why not.
NICK: Where? Where is he?
ANGELA: Nick, he's fine. He's in a hospital and they're fixing him up.
NICK: You talk to him?
ANGELA: Oh, sure... Twice a day.
NICK: What hospital is he in? Where?
ANGELA: Nick... Sal is very weak. He suffered a severe wound... and right now he doesn't want a whole lot of people to get involved in a whole thing.
NICK: Hey, Angela, Sal and I go back a long way.
ANGELA: He doesn't want people bugging him, Nick!
