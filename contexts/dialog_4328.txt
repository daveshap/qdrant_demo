FRANCESCA: I guess. Except I'm one of the people it frightens.
ROBERT: I doubt that.
FRANCESCA: Why?
ROBERT: Italy to Iowa? I'd call that a change.
FRANCESCA: Richard was in the army. I met him while I was living in Naples. I didn't know where Iowa was. I only cared that it was America. And of course, being with Richard.
ROBERT: What's he like?
