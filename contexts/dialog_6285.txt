MAX: Annie...it's Max.
ANNIE: Max...
MAX: Max, the cab driver!
ANNIE: Max? Oh... ...it's kind of a strange time to be calling...
MAX: Listen to me! Just listen, okay? There's a man, Vincent, he's coming to kill you!
ANNIE: He's...what? Say again? We're in cell hell...
MAX: <u>Kill</u> you! He's coming to kill you!
ANNIE: If this is a joke, it's not funny.
MAX: Dmitri hired him! He's already killed all your witnesses, now he's coming after you! He was stalking you when I dropped you off. I don't know what happened, but he diverted and got into my cab, instead.
ANNIE: Did you say <u>Dmitri?</u> How do you know about my case? I don't understand...
MAX: It doesn't matter! Just get out of the goddamn building...
ANNIE: ...okay, Max, I believe you...I'll get out of the building...
MAX: No, no, <u>wait</u>...
MAX: ...he's two floors below you.
ANNIE: In my office?
MAX: Where are you, what floor?
ANNIE: Seventh, files section. What should I do?
MAX: He doesn't know you're up there! Just stay right where you are! Call the police!
ANNIE: Max, I'm scared. Are you sure?
MAX: Yes! Stay put, goddamn it! Don't move from that spot...
