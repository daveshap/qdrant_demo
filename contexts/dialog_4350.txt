FRANCESCA: I don't know. I woke up a little dizzy. I didn't sleep well. I think I need to lay down.
MADGE: You want me to call the doctor?
FRANCESCA: No, no. I just didn't sleep well. I'm not used to sleeping alone. And this heat. Would you mind?
MADGE: No, of course not. I'll just clean up.
FRANCESCA: No, leave it. I'll do it later. Listen, maybe you and Floyd can come for dinner on Saturday. I'm sure Richard'll have so many stories to tell you both about the fair and all.
MADGE: Oh, that'll be nice.
