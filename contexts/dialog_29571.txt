VAL: Burt! This is Val! Get out of your basement!! Take your radio! You and Heather get up on your roof! Then we'll talk, okay?!
BURT: Val? What the hell you doing back already?
VAL: Burt, get out! Get up on your roof or someplace! We found out what's been killing people! They're under the ground!
BURT: What's under the ground? We're not getting up on the roof. Earth shelter's the best. Known that since I was a kid.
VAL: Listen! Listen! We know what they are! They're big things under the ground! Much bigger than we thought! They're coming after you! They're coming right now!
