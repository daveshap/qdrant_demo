JACK: Take my hand. I'll pull you back in.
ROSE: No! Stay where you are. I mean it. I'll let go.
JACK: No you won't.
ROSE: What do you mean no I won't? Don't presume to tell me what I will and will not do. You don't know me.
JACK: You would have done it already. Now come on, take my hand.
ROSE: You're distracting me. Go away.
JACK: I can't. I'm involved now. If you let go I have to jump in after you.
ROSE: Don't be absurd. You'll be killed.
