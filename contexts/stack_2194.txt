Can the enemy destroy their own distress beacon in a downed UFO mission? Playing a downed UFO mission (surprisingly I've only gotten one and I'm basically at the end of the game) and I was rushing to get to the distress beacon with four turns left - we're right outside the UFO doors and I end my turn, then Bradford comes on next turn saying \"looks like the beacon was destroyed\" etc. but we haven't even gotten IN the UFO yet?So I'm guessing a pod or something destroyed it, but I've never seen that happen before - I noticed that a Chryssalid popped up on the enemy turn and disappeared, is it possible they burrowed INTO the UFO and destroyed the beacon? I honestly can't figure out what just happened (though I'm not complaining)
