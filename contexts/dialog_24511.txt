RHEYA: What does Snow think you should do?
KELVIN: Snow thinks we shouldn't leave until we figure out a way to document it, to prove its existence to the planet Earth. This is hilarious: He thinks it's God, but he wants it to sit still for a photograph so he can show the folks back home.
RHEYA: Sartorius wants to destroy it.
KELVIN: Well. He doesn't think it's God, but for different reasons than me. He's thinking: If I can figure out how to make it stop, than I am smarter than it is, and therefore it cannot be God.
RHEYA: He has a point.
KELVIN: He does have a point. That's just not the way I'd like to see it proven.
RHEYA: You feel sorry for Solaris, or for me?
KELVIN: It's a violent response to something we haven't figured out. Don't let the cowardly demeanor fool you: He is ruthless. Unblinking in his prejudice.
RHEYA: It was obvious from the way he first looked at me.
RHEYA: Do I really feel like... I am...?
KELVIN: Yes. Yes.
RHEYA: I'm glad.
