I feel like im terrible at my job
I started my current position with a new company about 4months ago and ive been constantly feeling like i actually suck at what i do here. 

I seem to be making messes for my colleagues to clean up regularly and even though none of them or any of my managers have said a thing about it. Some of my colleagues also appear to be extra helpful and always checking on me, i cant tell whether they are simply worried about the quality of my work.

Before this position i was working for another company within the same industry (it being very unique and small in nature) only much more stressful and demanding in terms of skills and knowledge and i nailed it perfectly, however since i started here i couldnt feel a single sense of achievement and have been missing my old work constantly. Literally the only time i was happy was when something went wrong (out of my control) and i was able to spot the issue, intervened and fixed it properly using all my experience and knowledge built up from my previous job.

So guys, any idead what i should do? I cant quit just yet because of both personal and financial reasons and i really would like to stay here for at least 1year. How can i be better at it?
