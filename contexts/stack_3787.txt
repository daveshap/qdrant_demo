How to calculate which percentile a number is in given the mean and standard deviation? I'm aware that this is a very elementary problem but I can't seem to find an answer to this exact question and I'm pretty inexperienced with statistics in general.I have a value which represents my \"score\" on a test and I want to figure out which percentile I'm in (IE: top 1.4%). I have the mean score for the test and the standard deviation from that score, assuming standard deviation how can I find my percentile?Example:I scored 181 on a test where the average score is 40 and the standard deviation is 16.7. Is it possible to find from these numbers that, for example, my score is in the top .005%? Or do I need more data points than just the mean?Thanks!
