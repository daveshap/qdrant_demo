PERRY: 53.
MISS HENDERSON: 53!
PERRY: Okay? Goodbye.
MISS HENDERSON: You've got to pick three more numbers.
CLARK: Mr. White, please, I promised those people I'd get back to them by this morning. What do you think?
PERRY: Look, I don't know, Kent. . . CLARK Personally, I think it could be a terrific story!
LOIS: What terrific story?
PERRY: Kent's been invited to his high-school class reunion.
LOIS: Whoopee.
CLARK: It's practically an American ritual, Mr. White! Isn't that so, Jimmy?
JIMMY: I wouldn't know Mr. Kent. Most of the people I went to high school with are still in high school.
