A complete set of driving rules in Norway I am going to spend an extended period of time in Norway and will have to do quite a lot of driving. I wonder where could I find a complete set of driving rules in Norway (preferably in the form of a book or some sort of tutorial with a natural order that I could follow from A to Z)? The information could be either in English or in Norwegian.I know in some countries there are specialized books that serve as tutorials for to-be drivers and include all the relevant information you need to know as a driver. I have tried searching a bit but only found some legal material regarding traffic (written in a legal language and thus hard to read) and some books which I was not quite sure about (I did not want to spend 30 to 50 bucks on a book just to find out it is not what I need).
