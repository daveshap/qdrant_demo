Seeking advice and ideas for creating a networking event for sober students and students in recovery during new student orientation
Hello, I work at a very small, private, academically-competitive institution. For our new student orientation this year the whole division has been invited to pitch sessions on whatever topics they choose for a conference-style, pick-your-own-adventure day of orientation.

I'm interested in hosting a very casual 'networking' event for sober students and students in recovery. I was wondering if anybody has experience hosting this type of event for these student populations and can offer any advice and/or ideas to help me with my goals: (1) connect students with one another, (2) give opportunity to discuss party and substance use culture at the institution and supports (hopefully I can have returning students lead this conversation), and (3) provide a fun break in the often information-dense orientation experience.

I recognize that sober students and students in recovery can be two distinct student populations with different needs, but the school I work at is very small and I believe the event would be enhanced by combining them. I'm also open to the idea of pitching separate sessions, though.
