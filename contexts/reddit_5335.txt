Do you get this unhappy, annoyed, tense or dread feeling waking up to go to work?
I was unemployed for 8 weeks and I am now on my 3rd day of my new (and better) job. 

But, just like my old job, I wake up feeling annoyed that I have to force myself to go somewhere and the fact that I have to do that for the rest of the week.

I think I just need to get used to this routine after having 8 weeks of freedom. It does make me feel unhappy sometimes, but I know it is something we all have to do (I am 22, btw).

I get a pissed-off feeling, stomach tension and get thoughts like "I can't do this for the next few years" (but I then combat that with "tough, I have to save money").

I am 22, by the way.

Does anyone else feel like this when the alarm goes off on a working day?

UPDATE: So many insightful comments here and it has made me realise that I do have it somewhat better than others. Ultimately, I do like my new job, but I hate going to it every day for 7.5 hours, making money for someone else and working on their schedule. It is my goal to pursue business whilst working. So hopefully I can make something that will allow me to work for myself.
