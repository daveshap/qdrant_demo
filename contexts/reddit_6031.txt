Got laid off. Should I stay in a smaller role?
I was the assistant manager at an espresso bar inside of a high end clothing/department store. My position just got eliminated and I was laid off by corporate. But I have the option to transfer to a barista position. 

Cons: it’s less pay. Id be going from salaried to hourly. I’d be at the same level as people I was managing a few days ago. I would make more money on unemployment and have at least two months to find a new job before that runs out. General concerns about covid and being around people in a public area. 

Pros: job security. Having to find a new job is stressful and especially on covid times. I really like everyone I work with

If it was you, would you stay or would you go?
