KATE: We need your help.
DADE: Do my ears deceive me?
CEREAL: Nonononono. Truce, you guys. Listen, we got a higher purpose here, alright? A wake up call for the Nintendo Generation. We demand free access to data, well, it comes with some responsibility. When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child, but when I became a man I put away childish things. What... It's Corinthians I, Chapter 13, verse 11, no duh. Come on.
KATE: Phreak and Joey are being framed. We need your help to figure out what's on this disc.
DADE: I can't. Everybody who touches that thing gets busted, I can't afford to get arrested, I'm sorry.
CEREAL: Maybe I should just go to the bathroom or something.
KATE: What is it with you? I know we've been playing games, but, we're supposed to be on the same side and we really need your help. I really need your help.
DADE: I'm sorry, I can't.
KATE: Well, could you just make a copy of the disc? And just hide it in case we get busted, so we have something to give our lawyers, something that hasn't been tampered with? Can you do that?
