So I listen to music to calm myself and to numb down my suicidal thoughts for a bit, is this weird or do other people do it too and btw I usually listen to iamJakehill’s suicidal thoughts song look it up on YouTube/Spotify if you’re curious and this sub honestly makes me feel at home thank you
Have a nice day:)
