TAYLOR: A little dab'll do ya. Now you know how to get there, right?
DAWN: Why? Where are you going?
TAYLOR: I'm not going with you.
DAWN: What? What are you talking about?
TAYLOR: There's only room on that pod for seven. That's you and the others. I'm counting on you to get them out of there.
DAWN: And what are you going to do?!
TAYLOR: I'm going to try and buy you some time. I can get to the bridge from here.
DAWN: But how are you going to escape?
TAYLOR: Don't worry about me. There's still a chance I can issue a distress signal.
DAWN: But you can't be sure! It's suicide. You have to come with us!
TAYLOR: I can't!
