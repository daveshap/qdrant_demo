Asteroid material that can cause signal distortion I'm making a hard-ish sci-fi universe where humans colonized nearby star systems and found not one but two civilizations in Alpha Centauri, each at home on a planet orbiting one of the two main stars. These aliens are slightly less advanced than humans. Both species have fusion powered spaceships that can cross distances between planets in a fairly short time (think Epstein drive from The Expanse) and communicate using radio. Year is 3620.Meeting these aliens caught humans completely by surprise and my question is - is there a material that can distort signals so they don't get recognized by SETI but is also transparent (as we can see the Alpha Centauri system)?Idea is that there is a gas/rock/ice/debris/whatever field between us and Alpha Centauri that could distort any signals that would give away the civilization, like radio, but letting visible, IR ... pass through. How could this be?
