RICK: Been up with Alice.
DAN: How she doing? I ran into her last night.
RICK: She's blaming herself for Sheila. I know how it feels. I've been thinking about Kristen. Maybe I could've stopped it, if I'd listened.
DAN: About Freddy?
RICK: What else? You ever look over this town's history? Not a safe place to be a teenager. Anyway, if I'm next, watch your back.
