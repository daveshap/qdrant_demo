DEL: I sprint the last quarter mile. You gentlemen don't have to keep up if you don't care to.
MIKEY: Appreciate it, sir.
MIKEY: Guy cracks walnuts with his asshole.
CLIFF: You get the feeling he doesn't want to be here?
BEN: Sam the Man.
SAM: Hey, Ben. Thanks for coming down.
BEN: How's business?
SAM: Business is booming. Got your drugs, got your illegals--had a shooting the other night at Big O's--Soldier got ventilated.
BEN: I hear they're closing that post down.
SAM: September '97, that's all she wrote.
BEN: Gonna pull a lot of jobs out of this county.
SAM: Yeah, we'll have folks swimming over to Mexico to work in the sweatshops.
SAM: That the word on our boy?
BEN: Yeah, this is Skinny.
SAM: Skinny?
BEN: We find a body, it's either Skinny or Stinky, depending on how much meat there is on the bones.
SAM: Nice job.
BEN: Male, 40 to 50 years old, five-foot- eleven, chewed tobacco--then we get into the dental records--
SAM: Charley Wade.
BEN: That badge--
SAM: --it didn't come out of a cereal box.
BEN: Yeah.
SAM: You know the popular version of how he left town.
BEN: Everybody on the border knows that story.
SAM: You got a cause of death?
BEN: Skull was intact, no soft tissue left--not much to go on.
SAM: So he could have gone out to the base, hopped the fence, dug down into the dirt on the old rifle range and had a heart attack.
BEN: You uhm--you remember what old Buddy carried for a side arm?
SAM: Colt Peacemaker.
BEN: A .45--
SAM: He swore by it. What?
BEN: Just wondering.
SAM: So is Buddy on your short list?
BEN: If it was some poor mojado, swam across at night, got lost in the scrub and starved out there, we wouldn't go any further. But this is a formerly prominent citizen.
SAM: You got to investigate. No question about it.
BEN: What I will do is keep names out of it till we got some answers or hit a dead end. You know how the press is with a murder story--even if it's forty years old.
SAM: Yeah, it's a pretty cold trail.
