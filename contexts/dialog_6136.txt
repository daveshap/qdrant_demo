CUSTOMER: Pack of cigarettes. Cute cat. What's its name?
RANDAL: Annoying Customer.
DANTE: Can you imagine being halfway decent to the customers at least some of the time?
RANDAL: Let me borrow your car.
DANTE: May I be blunt with you?
RANDAL: If you must.
DANTE: We are employees of Quick Stop Convenience and RST video, respectively. As such, we have certain responsibilities which-though it may seem cruel and unusual-does include manning our posts until closing.
RANDAL: I see. So playing hockey and attending wakes-these practices are standard operating procedure.
DANTE: There's a difference. Those were obligations. Obligations that could not have been met at any later date. Now renting videos-that's just gratuitous, not to mention illogical, considering you work in a video store.
CUSTOMER: Are you open?
DANTE: Yes.
RANDAL: You know what? I don't think I care for your rationale.
DANTE: It's going to have to do for now, considering that it's my car that's up for request. Can I help you?
CUSTOMER: Pack of cigarettes.
RANDAL: What's your point?
DANTE: My point is that you're a clerk, paid to do a job. You can't just do anything you want while you're working.
CUSTOMER: Space Alien Revealed as Head of Time Warner; Reports Stock Increase." They print any kind of shit in these papers."
DANTE: They certainly do. Two fifty-five.
RANDAL: So your argument is that title dictates behavior?
DANTE: What?
RANDAL: The reasons you won't let me borrow your car is because I have a title and a job description, and I'm supposed to follow it, right?
DANTE: Exactly.
CUSTOMER: I saw one, one time, that said the world was ending the next week. Then in the next week's paper, they said we were miraculously saved at the zero hour by a Koala-fish mutant bird. Crazy shit.
RANDAL: So I'm no more responsible for my own decisions while I'm here at work than, say, the Death Squad soldiers in Bosnia?
DANTE: That's stretching it. You're not being asked to slay children or anything.
RANDAL: Not yet.
