Specific question concerning being a Seasonal Amazon Delivery Driver
Hi, very specific question, but on Indeed Amazon has tons of job listings for a Seasonal Driver. These jobs claim to occur in many different nearby towns however (including mine). But if you click 'Apply' to any of them they all redirect you the exact same corporate website link stating this job occurs in a city 70 minutes away from me. So my question is this-is this just Amazon BS trying to tell me this job *has the potential to* go through my town but in any case I'll have to drive 70 mins to pick up the van? Because if so I'm not going to bother signing up. Thanks!
