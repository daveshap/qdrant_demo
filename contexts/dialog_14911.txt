JIM: Who do you think changed the parade route?
LOU: Beats me. City officials. Secret Service. Dallas police. They did a dry run with Chief Curry a few days before. But they didn't bother running through Dealey. They stopped right there, said something like, and afterwards there's only the freeway
JIM: You know who the mayor was?
LOU: No.
JIM: Earle Cabell. And guess who his brother is?
LOU: Who?
JIM: General Charles Cabell. Deputy Director of the CIA. Fired by Kennedy in '61 because of the Bay of Pigs fiasco, he moved back to the Pentagon, called Kennedy a traitor". When he came to New Orleans to address the Foreign Policy Association
LOU: The Warren Commission call him?
JIM: His boss was the one on the Warren Commission who handled all the leads to the intelligence community.
LOU: Allen Dulles?
JIM: Head of the CIA since '53. Kennedy fired them both. Cabell was his deputy for nine years. Talk about the fox investigating the chicken coop. Now we'll have to subpoena them, Lou.
LOU: They're gonna love you, chief.
JIM: Maybe we should just call it a day, Lou. Go home. While we're still a little behind. We got two people killed, maybe more we never thought about.
LOU: You never got anyone killed, boss. Their actions killed them years before. If we stopped now, it'd be even more wrong.
