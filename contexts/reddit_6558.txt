Why is hiring old people so bad?
Iâ€™m interested to find out what makes older employees (like me) so bad.

I can imagine there are 10,000 reasons why people donâ€™t hire olds, but are any of them actually true, and to why extent, and how does that compare to any benefits, etc.?

When I used to interview, Iâ€™d pretty much give an automatic thumbs down or lukewarm reception at best to anyone who was â€˜oldâ€™ â€” which was prob 30+ at the time. The reason? I didnâ€™t want any pikers â€” I wanted someone who was going to sell their soul/sanity/health to the company for 80+ hours per week, and olds had families and just myriad other things in their lives.  

OK that was my personal experience as a hiring person. Now Iâ€™m on the other side of 40. Justice! ðŸ˜‚

But take for instance IBM â€” they fire everyone over say 35. Kind of Nazi-style â€” hey, they have the experience! ðŸ˜‚

But why is it so important for them to do this?

I imagine itâ€™s straight economics for them â€” fire the 40yo making $80k hire the fresher making $40k, done.

Thatâ€™s no small difference.

But what about new hiring? Are young kid always better than olds? Or is just a combination of things you get with young people?
* compliance/desperation
* cheaper labor 
* pliability 
* less expensive health care 
* prettier
* willing to work longer hours 
* smarter/sharper
* better versed in newer tech
* better attitude
Etc

Yeah wow thatâ€™s a lot.

I would generally agree with all that, but I wonder if there is an actual argument for keeping at least some old people on staff.

Like, older people with relatively inexpensive salaries in key positions could actually help a company more than a bunch of freshens?

I figure I might have one more job in me before I have to do my own company because nobody is going to hire me anymore.

Thanks for any thoughts. Interested in studies that might help us older folks get hired.
