CHARLIE: Hurry.
TED: What is it now?
CHARLIE: Check it out!
TED: Don't tell me. Another vision of incomparable beauty?
CHARLIE: Beauty? No. We're talking GODDESS.
TED: I get it now. You and me. We're dead.
CHARLIE: Dead?
TED: Our plane crashed. In the Grand Canyon. A big fiery explosion. We never made it to L.A. They needed dental records to identify us. And this place. This. Actually. Is. Heaven.
CHARLIE: Then there must be a whole room, made completely of chocolate.
TED: And some really fast cars.
CHARLIE: Don't be such a pansy. All of this is YOURS.
TED: It's a lot to digest. Imagine how you'd feel.
CHARLIE: I'd feel like staying up all night! Forever! Or at least till I got the LAY of the land, SO TO SPEAK.
TED: I feel like I'm entering a forbidden tomb...
CHARLIE: ...where they get all the really good porno channels on cable.
