Trying to be friends with my ex after dating for 8 months?
I'm not sure if this is a good idea or not. Every time we talk or hang out, she apologizes for breaking up with me, or I ask what I did wrong to prompt it. I've been trying recently to avoid this but...it just hurts. I don't want to just stop communicating with her though, you know?
