What made you finally quit your job?
Every single morning I wake up and hit the snooze button three times. I get to work early but walk in late. I have to take the city bus and it's awful. I hate being in the city because of the filth and stench. I hate feeling like a lab rat in a cage with others doing literally the same thing every day. I come home crying. I have no energy to do anything after work. It might sound obvious that it's time to quit, but I need the paycheck. I've been applying to other jobs since January with no luck. There's been several days I've cried in the bathroom and almost quit on the spot. I know I probably need therapy but I don't feel right about it for the fact I don't want to have to get help to live a certain way of life I don't want. I'm sorry for this rant. 
What made you finally quit a job you hated? What was that final last straw?
