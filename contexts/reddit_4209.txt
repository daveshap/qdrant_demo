I hate being alone, but the thought of dating makes me sick to my stomach.
Ugh, it's such a terrible conundrum. I feel so completely and utterly lonely, and it's made worse by all my family and friends having someone. Fuck, though, dude, dating just sounds like a miserable experience. Especially since online is pretty much my only option. 

I still remember the last time I tried. It was shortly after me and my ex broke up. We had been dating for a month so I had been spared the bullshit for a bit. Jumping right back into that bullshit for 2 days had me all like, "Man, fuck this." You've always gotta come up with some clever opener ðŸ™„, and then you feel like some dancing monkey who has to walk on eggshells while juggling chainsaws. 1 wrong word, 1 wrong use of punctuation, 1 mistake whatsoever, and she's gone. You finally get to where she says 'yes' when you ask her if she wants to go do something, but 9/10 times she just ghosts you when the time draws near. You're always having to compete with a million other guys, and they have the advantage of not being mentally handicapped. 

The kicker is that that is the easy part. When you meet her in person is when your dancing monkey act had better be spot-on. Unfortunately, my act definitely needs some work (on my first date of my life I asked a girl if she had any neighbors while I was holding a knife). I'm always super fuckin nervous. That's too bad, because it's all about first impressions, and I'm someone you've got to get to know first. If you suck at job interviews you will suck at dating as well.

Anyone else feel the same way? I'd really love to have someone I could spend some time with. Shit, but dating? No, way, dude. Fuck that shit.
