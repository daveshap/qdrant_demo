Do I need/Will it be helpful to obtain disability documentation from my school?
Suppose I requested special accommodations from my school for example extra time. Then I go to another school for further studies.

Is it common practice to obtain documentation of one's disability from one's previous school for example from the office of disability services?

So that in the future if I were to request for accommodations I would have to/it would be helpful to present documentation of me having been granted accommodations before?
