GRAHAM: He changes them into beings that accept him... And he needs to see the acceptance, In the mirrors. I didn't understand the mirrors before. It's very important.
CRAWFORD: 'Changes?'
GRAHAM: It's a word. Killing them... His delusion is: if he sees himself accepted enough times, he will become as one who has the power to be accepted all the time. And he would record it somehow. So he can see himself received over and over again...
CRAWFORD: VTR, film, Polaroid, stills, what?
GRAHAM: How do I know?!
GRAHAM: He's very careful, very... designed when he chooses. If we find out how he finds them, then we'll find him.
CRAWFORD: There's no connection between the families.
GRAHAM: There has to be.
CRAWFORD: There is none! We've run it through the computer a dozen times.
GRAHAM: He's a very shy boy...
CRAWFORD: What?
GRAHAM: Something Lecktor said.
CRAWFORD: Let's admit we struck out this month. The Gulf Stream's standing by. The basic lab stuff is on it. You, Zeller, Jimmie Price, a photographer. Anywhere he hits, we can be there in an hour and fifteen minutes. We get the call, we roll. The scene'll be very fresh...
GRAHAM: It's not over yet.
CRAWFORD: It's a foregone conclusion. For Christ's sake, it's eleven PM. The full moon is tonight.
CRAWFORD: Will?
GRAHAM: You wanna watch this or what?!
GRAHAM: That's why the boltcutter.
CRAWFORD: What's that?
GRAHAM: He used a boltcutter to trim the branch out of his way. When he was watching from the woods. Why didn't he use it to go through the basement door?
CRAWFORD: Because a steel door and deadbolt were there when they were killed.
GRAHAM: You mean Jacobi put it in between when this film was made and when he was murdered?
CRAWFORD: He had to.
