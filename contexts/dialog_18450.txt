CEDAR: It's merely a suggestion. I don't wish to press the point, Mr. Deeds, but if you'll give me your Power of Attorney we'll take care of everything. It'll save you a lot of petty annoyances. Every shark in town will be trying to sell you something.
LONGFELLOW: Oh, yes, there've been a lot of them around here already. Strangest kind of people. Salesmen - politicians - moochers - all want something. I haven't had a minute to myself. Haven't seen Grant's Tomb yet.
CEDAR: Well, you see, your uncle didn't bother with that sort of thing. He left everything to us. He traveled most of the time, and enjoyed himself. You should do the same thing, Mr. Deeds.
LONGFELLOW: Besides wanting to be my lawyer, you also want to handle my investments too?
CEDAR: Yes. That is to sayâ€”
LONGFELLOW: Well, outside of your regular fee, how much extra will it cost?
CEDAR: Oh - nothing. No extra charge.
LONGFELLOW: That involves a lot of extra work, doesn't it?
CEDAR: Yes, but that's an added service a firm like Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington usually donates.
LONGFELLOW: Budington. Funny, I can't think of a rhyme for Budington yet.
BUTLER: The gentlemen from the opera are still waiting in the board room, sir. They're getting a trifle impatient, sir.
LONGFELLOW: They are? I forgot all about them. What do you think they want?
CEDAR: Well, your uncle was Chairman of the Board of Directors. They probably expect you to carry on.
COBB: I'll tell those mugs to keep their shirts on, that you'll be right down.
LONGFELLOW: Thanks Oh, did you send that telegram to Jim Mason?
COBB: Jim Mason? Oh, yeah. Yeah. No, I didn't send it. I've got it written out, though. Here it is. Arthur's been with the Tallow Works too long. STOP. Don't think we should fire him. Longfellow.""
LONGFELLOW: Fine. Send it right away. I don't want him to fire Arthur.
COBB: Oh, sure. Sure. We don't want to fire Arthur.
LONGFELLOW: He was the last baby my father delivered, Arthur was.
CEDAR: I think you ought to give this matter some thought, Mr. Deeds.
LONGFELLOW: Huh?
CEDAR: I mean, about the Power of Attorney.
LONGFELLOW: Oh, yes. Yes, I will.
