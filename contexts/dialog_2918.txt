NICK: It doesn't make sense. She didn't know me three months ago.
GUS: Maybe it wasn't her that paid him. Maybe the money was for somethin' else. How the fuck do I know? I'm just an old city cowboy tryin' not to fall outta his saddle.
NICK: You all right, pop? You want me to drive you?
GUS: In that little pissant car of yours? Hell, no. I ain't gettin' no back pain disability retirement -- I'm gettin' me a full pension and a real gold-plate Seiko watch.
NICK: Come on, I'll drive you in this thing.
GUS: You think I'd let you drive my Cadillac car? I ain't lettin' no hear-up-his-ass person drive my Cadillac car.
LT. WALKER: Tell me again. I want to hear you say it again.
NICK: It was an accident.
LT. WALKER: You're driving around North Beach for no particular reason and this car won't get out of the way --
NICK: I don't think she meant to go off the hill, do you?
LT. WALKER: Don't fuck with me, Nick. I don't need a reason to put your ass in a sling.
