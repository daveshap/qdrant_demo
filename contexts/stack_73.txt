Why are hanged windows deminimizable but not minimizable? I see that whenever an app like Mac Chrome hangs, the app will show a spinner and stop responding. So that's the same behavior as for Windows, butI've realized an oddity for Mac:Why is it that the hanged Mac windows can still be moved around and deminimized, yet can't be minimized or closed?Is there a technical reason/rationale/explanation for this odd behavior?
