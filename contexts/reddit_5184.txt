How do you deal with job application fatigue?
I’m currently employed and have been trying to look for work out of state. My fiancé was relocated out of state and I have been trying to find work in his current city. I feel unemployed, despite still having a full-time job and a decent paycheck.

I’ve been looking on and off since April of this year. I have a feeling I’m gonna have a hard time even when I move to his city.

Job seekers, how do you deal with job app fatigue? I’m not even unemployed! Ugh.
