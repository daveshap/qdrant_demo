How should r/NeutralPolitics deal with the flood of submissions about the unfolding Ukraine story and impeachment?
As readers will no doubt be aware, there is a major political event engulfing American politics related to President Trump and his conduct in respect to Ukraine.  

With the House of Representatives moving in the direction of impeachment, the subreddit has been inundated with submissions on the details of the scandal, as well as the legal and political processes around it.

The mods are posting this thread to seek advice and feedback from users on how to handle this, as the volume of posts has become difficult, and we have unfortunately had some threads go off the rails.

A few options we have are:

1. **Using "green" questions to ask about major new developments.**  That is where the mods will write up a rules-compliant thread on a subject of major interest.  We have done this in the past with similar subjects.  [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/6a9j3d/is_there_evidence_to_suggest_the_firing_of_james/) for example.

2. **Just keep having normal question threads.**

3.  **Create megathreads when major new events happen.** A couple past examples of that [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/6989bb/ahca_megathread/) and [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/9iv4mt/megathread_un_general_assembly/)

4. **Have the mods write and post explainer threads on major issues.**  We did that [once](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/d8vz0o/mod_post_an_overview_of_the_impeachment_process/) in respect to this instance after Speaker Pelosi made an announcement of an impeachment inquiry.  

5.  **Something else.** I am just posting stuff here we've done in the past, but if people have ideas for different things to try, we'd love to hear them.
