FRANKI: -- so they get there and they ask the guy real nice for some kind of i.d., and he gets agitated, starts screaming about viruses. Totally irrational, totally disoriented, doesn't know where he is, what day it is, alla that stuff. All they got was his name. They figure he's stoned out of his mind, it's some kinda psychotic episode, so they're gonna bring him...
RAILLY: He's been tested for drugs?
FRANKI: Negative for drugs. But he took on five cops like he was dusted to the eyeballs. No drugs. You believe that?
RAILLY: You have him in restraints.
FRANKI: Were you listening? We got two officers in the hospital. Yeah, he's in restraints, plus the medic gave him enough stellazine to kill a horse. Look at him! Still on his feet.
RAILLY: That would explain the bruises, I guess. The struggle.
FRANKI: You want to go in? Examine him?
RAILLY: Yes, please. You said he gave a name...
FRANKI: James Cole. That's everything we got. None of the James Coles on the computer match him. No license, no prints, no warrants. Nothing. You want me to go in with you?
RAILLY: No, thank you.
FRANKI: I'll be right here...just in case.
RAILLY: Mr. Cole? My name is Doctor Railly. I'm a psychiatrist. I work for the County -- I don't work for the police. My only concern is your well being -- do you understand that?
COLE: I need to go now.
RAILLY: I'm going to be completely honest. I'm not going to lie to you. I can't make the police let you go...but I do want to help you. And I want you to trust me. Can you do that, James? May I call you James"?"
COLE: James"! Nobody ever calls me that."
RAILLY: Have you been a patient at County? Have I seen you someplace?
COLE: No, not possible. Listen, I have to get out of here. I'm supposed to be getting information.
RAILLY: What kind of information?
COLE: It won't help you. You can't do anything about it. You can't change anything.
RAILLY: Change what?
COLE: I need to go.
RAILLY: Do you know why you're here, James.
COLE: Because I'm a good observer. Because I have a tough mind.
RAILLY: I see. You don't remember assaulting a police officer...several officers?
COLE: They wanted identification. I don't have any identification. I wasn't trying to hurt them.
RAILLY: You don't have a driver's license, James? Or a Social Security card?
COLE: No.
RAILLY: Why not? Most people have some ID.
COLE: You wouldn't understand.
RAILLY: You've been in an institution, haven't you, James? A hospital?
COLE: I have to go.
RAILLY: A jail? Prison?
COLE: Underground.
RAILLY: Hiding?
COLE: I love this air. This is wonderful air.
RAILLY: What's wonderful about the air, James?
COLE: It's so clean. No germs.
RAILLY: You're afraid of germs?
COLE: I have to go.
RAILLY: Why do you think there aren't any germs in the air, James?
COLE: This is April, right?
RAILLY: July.
COLE: July?!
RAILLY: Do you know what year it is?
COLE: What year is it?
RAILLY: What year do you think it is?
COLE: 1995?
RAILLY: You think it's July of 1995? That's the future, James. Do you think you're living in the future?
COLE: No, 1995 is the past.
RAILLY: 1995 is the future, James. This is 1989.
