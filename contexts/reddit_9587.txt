Moving on from student affairs.. how? Looking for advice.
Hi! I’m a first year professional who was a non traditional student. I loved what my mentors did for me which is why I went into the field. In my current position, I feel stuck for many different reasons mainly being fit into the office culture. I’m a young mom of a toddler who works with women around my age but just act like mean girls. I just feel depressed every other week and want to find a new job. 

I work crazy hours - last month I had accumulated ~40 overtime that I can “use” as comp time (only when it is convenient for them). My leadership changed a month or two after I had started, the entire office dynamic had changed. I felt no support for the programs I have been running. It’s exhausting and emotionally taxing.

I had moved my entire family to a different state for this job and I have really not enjoyed my time in this position. Im searching for a new position but it seems like everything is out of my expertise. 

So I’m looking for advice, what can I do outside of higher ed with a masters degree in higher education? If you left higher ed, where did you go? Anyone have positive success stories?
