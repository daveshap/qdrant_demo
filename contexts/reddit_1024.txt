Honestly not wanting quarantine to be over
I haven’t done anything social since covid started and I’m loving it. I hate parties, I hate social events so the fact that I like almost legally can’t go to any is great. Our state just okayed social gatherings of <10 people though so immediately my boyfriend’s friends decided to have a fire and invited us. 

I’m having an absolutely awful anxiety day - I’m guessing the fact that it’s tonight is primarily causing it, and I don’t want to go at all.

Is it normal to want to be by yourself this much? It’s been almost 3 months of quarantine and I’m still not socially rejuvenated.
