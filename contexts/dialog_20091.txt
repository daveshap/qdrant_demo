PAULA: You know, sometimes I wish I was one of those girls they're letting in the flight program these days. God, I'd love to fly.
ZACK: What's stopping you?
PAULA: I don't care what the magazines say... it's just not as easy being a girl, especially from a Catholic family. You don't know the junk I grew up listening to, 'bout the way women are supposed to think and act.
ZACK: That's no excuse for not going after what you want.
PAULA: Who says I'm not going after what I want? My mother's thirty-nine years old and she still works in that factory. Every time I see her, I know exactly what I don't want.
ZACK: My old lady swallowed a bottle of pills one day while I was at school.
PAULA: God.
ZACK: The thing that really got to me... she didn't leave a note. Nothing. I've always hated her for that.
PAULA: Does it still hurt?
ZACK: Naw. You're alone in this world no matter what kinda folks or background you had. Nothing hurts, pard, once you got that one down.
