How lucky in life you have to be to find someone crazy about you and vice versa.
I’ve been putting myself out in the dating world since last year. I haven’t had trouble finding dates. But I just find it amazing how people can find a long term significant other. I am mind boggled people can somehow find a person they can connect and have chemistry with and the feelings are reciprocated. Also, the timing. The timing is right (ie. I found this connection but he is really focusing on his career right now). I’m not losing hope. But I am now understanding that luck is a factor in dating as well.
