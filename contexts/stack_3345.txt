What were the slaves doing on the spaceship? From the intro to the 1989 Alien Nation TV show:<blockquote>  That was the scene in California's Mohabi desert five years ago. Our historic first view of the newcomer ship. Theirs was a slave ship, carrying a quarter of a million beings, bred to adapt and labour in any environment. But they've washed ashore on Earth, with no way to get back to where they came from. And in the last five years the Newcomers have become the latest addition to the population of Los Angeles.</blockquote>I've watched the whole series but didn't manage to catch an explanation of what the slaves were actually doing aboard the spaceship before it crashed. The Overseers were obviously controlling the Newcomers to extract some sort of forced labour from them (they're slaves, after all). However, what specifically were the Newcomers doing during their enslavement?
