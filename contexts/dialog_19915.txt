WILLIAM: Was it you?
SPIKE: I suppose I might have told one or two people down the pub.
WILLIAM: Right.
HONEY: Have we got something for you. Something which will make you love me so much you'll want to hug me every single day for the rest of my life.
WILLIAM: Blimey. What's that?
HONEY: The phone number of Anna Scott's agent in London and her agent in New York. You can ring her. You think about her all the time -- now you can ring her!
WILLIAM: Well, thanks, that's great.
HONEY: It is great, isn't it. See you tonight. Hey, Marty-- sexy cardy.
