EEG, DIAGNOSIS:, Possible cerebrovascular accident.,DESCRIPTION:, The EEG was obtained using 21 electrodes placed in scalp-to-scalp and scalp-to-vertex montages. The background activity appears to consist of fairly organized somewhat pleomorphic low to occasional medium amplitude of 7-8 cycle per second activity and was seen mostly posteriorly bilaterally symmetrically. A large amount of movement artifacts and electromyographic effects were noted intermixed throughout the recording session. Transient periods of drowsiness occurred naturally producing irregular 5-7 cycle per second activity mostly over the anterior regions. Hyperventilation was not performed. No epileptiform activity or any definite lateralizing findings were seen.,IMPRESSION:, Mildly abnormal study. The findings are suggestive of a generalized cerebral disorder. Due to the abundant amount of movement artifacts, any lateralizing findings, if any cannot be well appreciated. Clinical correlation is recommended.neurology, scalp-to-scalp, scalp-to-vertex, montages, electrodes, amplitude, epileptiform activity, cerebrovascular accident, eegNOTE
