Considering Grad School in a Different Field
I am considering getting my Masters in either Psychology or Human Resources so that I can go a bit further in my career. I gained my Bachelors of Business Administration with a concentration in Management in Spring 2017, and have since been working within sales/recruiting. 

I have always had an interest in psychology, and was wondering if i would a.) be able to begin a masters program in psychology with a bachelors degree in business, and b.) what those steps would ultimately look like. I understand that I would most likely need to take the GRE regardless due to my mid 2.5 or so GPA (I actually forget exactly what it was, but I know it was not indicative of what it should have been) so I am considering a Spring/Fall 2021 start. 

Any thoughts/opinions/advice are greatly appreciated!!
