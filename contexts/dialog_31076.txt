JOHNNIE: I got some news, Marietta. Lula and Sailor been here. They checked out of the Hotel Brazil on Frechman Street yesterday.
MARIETTA: Listen, Johnnie, Lula just called me. She knew you were in N.O., so they left the city.
JOHNNIE: Did she tell you where she was callin' from?
MARIETTA: No, but my guess is they're headed west, so prob'ly Texas. Their money must be runnin' low. I don't think Sailor had much to begin with, if any, and Lula took the six hundred she had saved in the Cherokee Thrift.
JOHNNIE: How'd she sound? Was she doin' okay?
MARIETTA: Could she be doin' okay, Johnnie? She's tryin' to prove somethin' to me, that's all. Lula ain't doin' no more'n showin' off, defyin' me... Johnnie, I've done somethin' bad...
JOHNNIE: What?
MARIETTA: I won't tell you over the phone. I'm comin' to N.O. and I'll tell you then.
JOHNNIE: Marietta, I was just gonna leave and see if I could pick up their trail.
MARIETTA: No, you wait right there for me... I'll be on the Piedmont flight tomorrow at seven. Meet me at the airport.
JOHNNIE: I'll meet you, Marietta, if that's what you want, but I'm against it.
MARIETTA: Seven tomorrow evenin'. We can eat at Galatoire's. Fix it.
LULA: How much we got left, honey?
SAILOR: Under a hundred.
LULA: You want to stick around here, Sailor? See if we can get some work?
SAILOR: Not in Houston. We'd be better off in some place more out of the way.
LULA: You want me to drive for a stretch? Give you a chance to rest.
SAILOR: That'd be good, Lula.
ARTIE: Come in, Montgomery, Alabama.
CALLER #1: Artie? That you, Artie?
ARTIE: Yes, ma'am. What's on your almost- perfect mind this evening?
CALLER #1: How ya feelin', Artie? I heard you wasn't doin' too well recent.
ARTIE: I'm fine, thank you. I had a cardiac infarction but I'm on a new diet and exercising regularly. I've never felt better.
CALLER #1: Well, that's so good to hear, Artie. You know some of us depend on you down this way. You're so entertainin' and you get so many interestin' guests.
ARTIE: Thank you. It's listeners such as yourself who made me want to get up out of that hospital bed and back into the studio as fast as I could.
