About the use of \"that\" I have a very quick question that makes me stuck when I read magazines in particular.The issue is the usage of that. I am totally aware of its usage in some examples but in some cases, it makes me totally confuse and cannot figure out what it refers to it.Some examples;<blockquote>  The problem that now arises seems to be quite serious. [relative]    The problem arises now.<br>  The problem seems to be quite serious.<br>  The problem that economics is getting worse seems to be quite serious.      The problem is economics is getting worse<br>  The problem seems quite serious.</blockquote>All good so far.However, some examples making me confuse is as follows.<blockquote>  Dislike of Mr Erdogan is one of the few things that unites all Germany\u2019s political families. (Excerpt from The Economist Magazine)</blockquote>Here, as far as I know before that there is a noun called things, but after that it says unites not unite. (Things are plural and In my opinion, it should have been written unite given that it refers to things)All I know is that \"that\" refers to something mentioned right before itself.Am I mistaken? Can \"that\" refer to something I cannot figure? ( In this case, maybe it refers to \"one of the things\")Could anyone shed some light on that issue making me bothered?
