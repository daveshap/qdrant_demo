Wtf do people do for a living where they can buy houses and range rovers?
I’m 26, and I don’t know what I want to do for a career. I’ve had over 25 jobs (mostly pertaining to event staffing and restaurants). Ive also moved a dozen times to different cities. As you can see I have a really hard time “sticking” to things, mostly fueled by the curiosity of “what else is out there” 
I’ve been back and forth school, changed majors like 6 times. I usually do something math/science oriented but find a reason to stop going like “i can’t get a job in that field” or “it’s boring.” I get straight A’s and I’m a hard worker and I’ve made some decent tips but I’m just ready to make a real salary. I don’t understand what it takes, where to start, how to find something I can do. I live in an area where houses are $1 million dollars and I just don’t get how so many people can afford it and it frustrates me. I’m afraid of shifting around BS jobs for years to come and having nothing to show for it. Please help me figure out what to do. I’m currently in trade school for electrical but I’m not sure if the field is right for me either.

Edit: THANK YOU everyone who responded. Your advice is indispensable and I definitely gained a better understanding of how to succeed. I’ll stick with trade school and root myself in that field. Thanks again :-)
