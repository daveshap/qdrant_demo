Trump considering firing Mueller, to which Adam Schiff replies: "If President fired Bob Mueller, Congress would immediately re-establish independent counsel and appoint Bob Mueller. Don't waste our time." Is that possible?
[This article from The Hill](http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/337509-trump-considering-firing-special-counsel-mueller) states there may be a possibility Trump is thinking of firing Mueller. 

Schiff in the [above tweet](https://twitter.com/RepAdamSchiff/status/874406787293773824) suggests congress would establish an independent counsel and appoint Mueller again. My question is according to this [Twitter reply thread to Schiff's comment](https://twitter.com/drawandstrike/status/874440840718028800) by a very conservative user it's not possible for congress to establish an independent counsel, and that the Attorney General has to do so.

Not knowing enough about this myself I am inclined to believe Schiff knows what he is talking about, but would anyone be able to share some insight on where the argument (or semantics) are coming from here, and if this scenario is a possibility either way.
