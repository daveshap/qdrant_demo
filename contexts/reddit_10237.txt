Anyone else feels like a burden to their friends?
I feel like my only friend is tired of me. Honestly? I don't blame her. Dealing with a miserable fuck like me must be pretty tiring. Whenever I bring up the fact that I don't feel good or try to share something personal it almost feels as if she wants to tell me to fuck off lol I feel bad saying all this, she means a lot to me and I'm sure she means well but.. damn I feel really lonely and alone with my problems. Maybe I'm just whiny and selfish but sometimes I want more than "Don't think about it, others have it worse". Sometimes I feel like I'm the problem and just pretend that everything is okay so she won't get uncomfortable around me. Is it selfish to feel this way? I feel really alone.
