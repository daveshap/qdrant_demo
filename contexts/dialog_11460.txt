SUZETTE: Mon Dieu -- the pearls -- if they were to break --
GRUSINSKAYA: The pearls won't break -- they hold together and bring me bad luck ---- I hate them!
SUZETTE: Orchids come again, Madam -- no card -- I think perhaps they are from the same young man -- he is at the end of the corridor -- tall -- he walks like a soldier -- Madam must have noticed how often he is in the elevator with us. Last night for instance --
GRUSINSKAYA: Oh, Suzette -- Suzette -- Sshh -- quiet.
SUZETTE: Ah, oui -- the car is here for Madam.
GRUSINSKAYA: Send it away -- I shan't need it.
