TANNER: And believe me, word will get out that you're a pro rat.
GARCETTI: That's not good in prison. It's just not good.
GARCETTI: What's that smell?
DANNY: That would be me.
GARCETTI: What'd you do, piss your pants?
DANNY: Hell, yes! What the hell do you expect zapping Mr. Johnson with that crackler?
GARCETTI: Who'd have thought it? Danny Chickenshit" Flynne trying to go large right under our noses."
DANNY: Lay off, Garcetti. I'm not in the mood.
GARCETTI: No. You've got me all wrong. I mean, in you own pussified way, you actually got some nuts in your little sack.
TANNER: Bullshit. He's a liar.
DANNY: News-flash, Tanner. I'm a fucking rat.
TANNER: You think you're so god damned smart, don't you?
LIZ: Why didn't you just ask for directions back there?
DANNY/TOM: Come on, where's your pioneer spirit?
LIZ: You mean like the Donner Party?
DANNY/TOM: Hey, do you think you could eat me if you had to? And if so, which part do you think you would find the most delicious?
LIZ: Tom, quit fucking around.
DANNY/TOM: Okay, okay. There's a house up there. I'll go ask for directions.
LIZ: You think that's a good idea?
DANNY/TOM: What do you mean?
LIZ: Look at that place. It's creepy.
DANNY/TOM: First you want me to ask for directions, then you don't. Which is it?
LIZ: I wanted you to ask back there. You know, before you got us lost.
DANNY/TOM: Just no pleasing you, is there?
LIZ: Just admit you're wrong.
DANNY/TOM: We all know how much you like hearing that. Okay, Liz, I was wrong. There. You happy?
LIZ: Quit feeling sorry for yourself, Tom. It gets old.
DANNY/TOM: No. You know what gets old? Being reminded what a loser you are every time you screw up.
LIZ: Here it comes, poor Tom.
DANNY/TOM: But that's okay, Liz, you're the one with the steady job, you pay all the bills. I'm just an unemployed musician. You have every right.
LIZ: That is so unfair.
DANNY/TOM: My sentiments exactly.
LIZ: Why are you doing this?
