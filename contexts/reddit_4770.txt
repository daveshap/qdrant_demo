I wish life had a reset button
I feel lost and aimless. I have goals and things I want to do, but my decisions over the last years have pushed me away from the career I now realised I want. Making a change now feels nearly impossible, especially since I'd like to migrate. (Increasing xenophobia across nations, pending drastic resource shortage, yaaaaay)

I am struggling and finding opportunities that get me closer step by step but I can't help but dream of how things could have been had I made better decisions. Even the decisions I'm making now, though they feel right, I'm terrified I'll regret the also. And I'm making a commitment on this, a step that is interdisciplinary between what I've been doing and what I want to do, that I'd hate to break. 

I am losing faith in hard work and efforts. I feel like I'm stuck dealing with the consequences of my mistakes, in choosing the wrong field, forever. Which is probably true.
