Randomly selected to NOT drug test??
Hi there,

I recently accepted an offer for a Senior-level tech role at JPMorgan Chase (think development/design/engineer). 

As I’m completing the online scheduling for different onboarding steps, I notice they state on the portal that I’ve been randomly selected to NOT drug test. 

...

I’ve never seen that before, as every non-contract role I’ve had has required a drug test. 

I consume cannabis fairly regularly, for several years (I’m a disabled vet and use it to treat PTSD symptoms and pain), but I obviously stopped consuming for a while in anticipation of this offer. 

Does anybody have any knowledge of JPMorgan testing after onboarding, or even of this practice? 

Thanks in advance!
