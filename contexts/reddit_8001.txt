How to pay for grad school?
Well, it happened! I got accepted into my dream school (osu) for my dream program (epidemiology)! Now, a new type of anxiousness has set in. How does financial aid work in grad school? For undergrad, I got a lot of government assistance because I come from a fairly poor family (I got the Ohio Pell grant, specifically), but moving ahead, I know a lot of my scholarships and government grants were only for an undergraduate degree. I'm starting to think I can't just close my eyes and accept the loans and be done with it lol. I am currently out of money and grad school is coming quick. 

How do you all afford it (besides just applying for scholarships)? Is there government assistance? Is it different than undergrad? Do I have to bank on getting into an assistantship?
