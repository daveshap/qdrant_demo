LIEUTENANT: Anderson, Arthurs, Boulier. What is this?
PAUL: The guest list. It hasn't been updated since the murder of the president.
LIEUTENANT: Are you trying to make a fool of me? There are no Europeans left in that hotel. Get me the names of all the cockroaches in there.
PAUL: That will take time.
LIEUTENANT: You don't have time. If I do not have the names, so that I can pick out the traitors, then I will kill everyone here in this car park. Get in there now.
