LEN: Delbert seems to enter #21 twice. Without leaving the first time.
SHROT: Let's get him in here.
MILO: Great. I knocked off the aglet, as soon as I get a passable version of Skywire we're there.
LISA: The dishes are juiced up, too.
MILO: Thank God.
LISA: Milo? Shrot suspects somebody broke into #21. I was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts.
MILO: They know I broke in. Alice helped me. Shrot's not one of them. He's blundering into this on his own.
LISA: He doesn't know about the Day Care.
MILO: Hardly anybody does, that's the beauty part. No cameras, the DOJ doesn't bother with it, it's accessed by a tunnel they boast about. You know the best place to hide a leaf?
LISA: Yeah, that's old, in a tree.
MILO: Oh.
LISA: Milo? What if Shrot notices somebody entered the Day Care at four A.M.? And tells them about it?
