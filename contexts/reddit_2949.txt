Unpaid interships after graduating college and having done previous internships.., Are you Fucking kidding me?
I've been suggested by people to look into unpaid interships to get my foot in the door. Additionally, google seems to affirm this as a possible route, especially for jobs in communications which have lower salaries then most career paths anyways. 

So, are people really paying to live in expensive cities to work for free for a company that may or may not be exploiting their labor and never hire them? And do companies offering full time positions expect you to have 4 internships by the time you have graduated from top companies in order to get an entry level position?

Is this really what it comes to with communications careers?
