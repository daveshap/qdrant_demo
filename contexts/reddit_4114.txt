How do you deal with knowing about a partners history?
Some people care about their partners history some dont. I wish I was the kind that didnt, but I cant.  As soon as I start to like someone, the thought of them being with someone else makes me feel physically sick. I've dealt with this before too, and it makes me want to ask questions and pry, even though I have no business knowing and the answer might hurt me. The stupid thing is I have a history too, obviously, and it doesn't seem to bother anyone I've seen. I've been trying to not think about it, and for the most part it works, but when it comes to things like discussing that we should both get STD tested, it forces me to think about it and it hurts.

Edit: I have to say that I was originally hesitant to post this, because I was worried about being called all sorts of negative things.  Well, the responses have been overwhelmingly supportive and non judgemental, so thank you guys for that. I think this is a symptom of a deeper issue, one that I will be looking into getting help for, thanks.

Edit 2: this thread has really opened my eyes to the fact that this isnt about the actual sex as much as it is about insecurity and mental health in general. I think I'm going to focus on getting that under control, regardless of how things turn out with the person I'm seeing now. Thanks everyone that contributed!
