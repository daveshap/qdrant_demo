Fastest Route to Special Agent?
Hey Redditors, 

I've wanted to be a federal special agent for a while.
Luckily, my parents are finally gonna chip in and help pay for a portion of my undergrad. 

I have 2 years left, as I  finished my AA in High school. (M23)

Would it be fastest to finish the bachelors, get an MPA and then apply? Something like Postal Inspector or ATF Agent really appeals to me.

Or enlist into say, the Navy as a Master at Arms Navy Police? Problem I see there is that im stuck for 8 years vs commissioning in.  The experience would certainly get me noticed.

The main 3 careers I want over my lifetime is being a Special Agent, working in architectural historic preservation, and leading/running a housing or urban development state or federal agency.  (Really, just managing any mid size agency would be dream come true.)

In all honesty I would rather not work for 4 years at minimum wages to earn an investigators license mainly because I have a hatred for the private sector.


Also, would my undergrad need to be strictly CJ or could I double major?

Whatcha got? :)
