In Kingdom Hearts, what counts as \"Items Used\"? When I finish Kingdom Hearts (PS2 Greatest Hits release) on Expert mode, after the credits and epilogue cutscenes, there's a screen that shows various statistics, such as Heartless Defeated, number of times Sora took damage, etc.  One of these is \"Items Used\".But what exactly counts toward this \"Items Used\" statistic?  Does it include:Sora uses a consumable (Potion, Ether, up to Megalixir) from inventory, in or out of combat?An ally uses a consumable in combat?A consumable (which could be in inventory) is used directly from stock out of combat?The party uses a stock-only HP/MP restoration object (Tent, Cottage, etc.)?Sora uses a stat booster (Power Up, Defense Up, AP Up)?An ally uses a stat booster?Sora gives an item to a flower in Wonderland's forest?An item is consumed by the \"recipe\" or \"experiment\" in Deep Jungle's Camp area?Anything involving unique plot-related or puzzle-related items?
