My grandma called asking which prestigious colleges I got into...
And when I told her I didn't get into much except my safeties and a few waitlists, She told me I don't need a fancy degree from a prestigious school and that with my work ethic I'm bound to be successful. Ngl, I cried and a big burden fell from my shoulders. Love your grandmas, ya'll.
