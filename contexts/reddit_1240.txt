Anyone ever had anxiety that makes you not want to eat?
For a little over a month, I have been having some pretty bad bloating, loose stool, inability to eat a large meal because of that bloating feeling, lots of gas and belching.  My doctor seems to be certain that its my anxiety; given I am healthy, no family history of any serious illness, and relatively young.  However, as we do, I cannot shake the feeling something serious is wrong with me and its affecting my every day life quite a bit.  I feel hungry and my stomach growling, but when I eat its hard to finish a meal.  I am actually SCARED of meal time because I am worried I cant finish the entire meal.  Plus, I have lost a few pounds over the past month which is only making me more nervous.
