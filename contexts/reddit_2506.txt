What do people do to make over 200k a year?
So i’m in school now (in Finland) and my grades are pretty good and i have motivation. My problem is that i don’t know what job i’d want to pursue in the future.

 I just looked at some sub where everyone is complaining about having to have a ton of experience just to make 30k a year. That is the opposite of where i want to end up and i got me thinking. I have always been told just to go to school and get good grades but I’ve seen that it doesn’t always get you rich or happy. Law school and medical school would be ways there i guess, but they don’t interest me too much.

What are some jobs where you can make 200k+a year? 

I don’t need a motivational speech about “do what you love” because my dreams and interests can’t be achieved with 30k a year. I would like to know what people do to end up in those numbers (the 200k+). Sorry if the post is kind of a train wreck tho, I’m not used making posts like these.
