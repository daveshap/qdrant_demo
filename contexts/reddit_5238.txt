Is it ok to call off/go home sick for anxiety or mentally not feeling well?
So I have mild anxiety and I work as a cashier as a store that sells groceries in a small town, and with this pandemic my job is going so roughly that I’ve been nervous, anxious, jittery and the other day I felt like I’d pass out after only 2 hours of work. 

I only work 12 hours a week on average and I wanted to know that if this feeling gets any worse, if I can call off or go home sick due to it? 

Or is it heavily frowned upon or get me fired immediately? 

Prior to this pandemic, I was fine and doing well, but everything has been so hectic.
