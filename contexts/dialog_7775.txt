LLOYD: Whoa. What was that?
HARRY: What?
LLOYD: Your mom made a move on me.
HARRY: She did not.
LLOYD: Who knows? Maybe someday I'll be your new daddy.
HARRY: LLOYD, she's my mom.
LLOYD: I can't help my heart. And when I'm your dad, you'll have to do as I say.
HARRY: Will not.
LLOYD: Don't use that tone with me, young man.
HARRY: Shut up!
LLOYD: I will stop this car right now.
HARRY: You're not my real dad.
LLOYD: You take that back!
HARRY: Shut Up! Buttlick!
LLOYD: Where did you learn that word?
HARRY: I learned it from listening to you! I hate you!
LLOYD: Kids.
