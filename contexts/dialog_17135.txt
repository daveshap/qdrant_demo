GEORGE: When you play the Midwest and South, you DON'T MINDFUCK THESE PEOPLE! It's not postmodern -- it's rude. If you wanna perform in Texas, you give 'em Mighty Mouse! You give 'em Elvis!!
ANDY: But George, I like to push the boundaries...
GEORGE: And that's great. But do it in LA and New York! There you experiment! Show up with a sleeping bag and take a nap on stage! I don't care!
ANDY: How long would they let me sleep?
GEORGE: I don't know! Andy... you need to look inside: Who are you trying to entertain? The audience... or yourself?
GEORGE: I'm worried about Andy. His stress level is affecting his work.
ZMUDA: Isn't Tony Clifton going on Taxi soon? Maybe that'll chill him out.
GEORGE: Bob, Andy needs to RELAX. See if you can get him away from all this. Take him to Hawaii, or Bali... Find something special. Something nice...
ANDY: I dunno about this... What will my mother think?
ZMUDA: She'll say, Now my son is a man.""
ANDY: It's so dirty.
ZMUDA: Nah. The girls sponge off between johns.
