How much do I owe him? (I'm 28F, he's 34M)
I have been chatting with this guy since the beginning of October, for our fourth date I went to his condo to watch Netflix (with the idea being that I would sleep over) but his place was SO DIRTY and so stinky - which made me so uncomfortable that I left ... I managed to contract a horrible flu from him, have been dead to the world for two weeks ... and now he's asking for clarity.  


I left late at night, telling him that I was uncomfortable. I texted him on the way home apologizing for the drama. The next day I explained that it was the lack of hygiene and cleanliness in his place that made me uncomfortable - and he was shocked. He said that he cleaned for hours before I came over. I want to just leave it as is, but he has asked for specific examples for why I was uncomfortable...   


The place was so stinky that it was as if the air was thick?? If it was my job to clean the place up I honestly would have no idea where to start, just burn it down and start fresh? As soon as I stepped foot in the door I felt like I should get out ASAP. He was a really nice guy, a bit socially awkward. I keep thinking that this nasty condo of his will end every relationship that he tries to get into for the rest of his life? Do I owe him a slap in the face wake-up call of an answer?? Or can I leave it as is?
