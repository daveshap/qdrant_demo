LULA: ...are followin' him around.
SAILOR: Prob'ly the rain boys from Outer Space.
LULA: It ain't so funny now, though. December before Christmas? Dell disappeared again and Aunt Rootie hired a private eye to find him. He was missin' for almost a month before he wandered back in the house on mornin' dressed in some filthy Santa Claus suit.
LULA: The private eye cost Aunt Rootie over a thousand dollars? Then a little while later Dell ran off a third time to some place he said would give him peace of mind." Nobody's seen him since."
SAILOR: Sound like ol' Dell's more'n just a little confused, peanut... Too bad he couldn't visit that ol' Wizard of Oz and get some good advice.
LULA: Too bad we all can't, baby... One thing about Dell?
SAILOR: What's that?
LULA: When he was about seventeen, he startin' losin' his hair.
SAILOR: So?
LULA: He's twenty-four now? A year older than you? And must be 'bout bald.
SAILOR: There's worse things that can happen to a man, honey.
LULA: Yeah, I suppose. But you know somethin' baby, hair does make a difference.
