Globalism, Brexit and the rise of populism — Is there another path?
Analysis and opinion pieces for background:

I take away a few things from the articles above:

* There's a growing sense among voters in the west that the winners from globalization are foreigners and the elites, while the losers are the hardworking local populations. 
* The result is that populism is on the rise.
* Left-wing and right-wing populism have the same origins. Considering them separate entities is to misunderstand the root causes.
* The power of these movements has been consistently underestimated by the political classes and the media entities who respond to them. Brexit and the nomination of Donald Trump are the clearest examples, but Spain, Greece, France and Denmark also have had recent cases of the ruling classes scrambling to maintain their hold on power in the face of populist revolts at the ballot box.
* The people, by and large, aren't buying the scary rhetoric of the ruling class about the negative consequences of setting out a populist and/or nationalist agenda.

I'd first like to know if any of those are incorrect conclusions and why.

But my main question is whether populism is the inevitable result of globalization or if there is a path that lowers trade and immigration barriers, but doesn't necessarily lead to the sense of citizen disenfranchisement that encourages populist uprisings?

Let me be clear that I'm not passing judgment on populism here. If that is a necessary and expedient path to fair and equitable treatment of the citizenry, so be it. But [the history doesn't consistently favor that view,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populism) so I'm wondering if there are proven alternatives.
