If you get a snarky pro-suicide PM after posting here, IT'S NOT ABOUT YOU! Somebody's doing this randomly and indiscriminately.
This sticky post is here to take away the element of surprise, which we hope will make it a bit less upsetting for anyone who gets one of these messages.  We also hope it will make it less fun for the twisted <expletive> who's doing this.  The PMs are coming from a variety of different reddit accounts.  

If you get one, please click "report" as this brings the message to the attention of the reddit admins.  As moderators we don't have any ability to see or regulate PMs, but we have also used the channels available to us to make the admins aware of what's been happening.
