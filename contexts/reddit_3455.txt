This sub is nonstop complaining with little advice on actual dating.
I thought r/dating would be a place where people talk about how to find people, how to date, date ideas, what to do or what not to do, etc. it seems that most of everything on this sub is just complaining about apps, not being attractive and giving up, or wishing things would go back to the “good old days” without phones. Correct me if I’m wrong, but I would hope there could be change. Are there other subs more similar to what I’m looking for? Thanks.
