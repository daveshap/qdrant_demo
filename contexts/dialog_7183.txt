SARAH: Let me go! I'm the one he wants. This is all happening because of me. If I turn myself in...
JOHN: He's just finding another reason for bumpin' us off. Don't ya see. He needs us ta die. He needs our bodies.
TOBY: It's alright. I'm a friend. I need help and so do you. What's a safe place to talk?
JOHN: Ain't no place safe.
TOBY: Look...I know you have no reason to trust me. I've got friends in the Cave. I got some stuff comin' out this mornin'. I'm gonna try to get off the island.
TOBY: I'm gonna have this stuff sent over to the hospital...
JOHN: The hospital?
TOBY: Yeah. My stuff's all marked with red crosses so nobody gets too nosey. Meet me at the hospital after the supplies come in. Maybe we can find a place there to talk.
JOHN: Maybe.
TOBY: Hey, Tricks. Some detail they got you on.
TRICKS: Not as bad as yours, pal.
TOBY: What'dya get?
TRICKS: Rafts. Two 38s. A little ammo.
TOBY: We need fuel, and a couple automatics.
