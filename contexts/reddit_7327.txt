Non-IT certifications that will help me get a job?
I'm currently considering a career change out of IT and into something else. There are plenty of IT certifications that I could pursue, but I just don't have the interest. So I'm wondering if there are any other certs I could study for that will actually help me start a new career.

I'm not interested in sales, and I have a bad back and bad feet/ankles, so anything that requires me to stand all day or lift heavy loads is out. Aside from those restrictions, I'm interested in hearing about any certs I can pursue on my own, in my free time, that could actually facilitate a career change.

Thank you.
