MAX: That's odd...
ORIGINAL CINDY: What?
MAX: Tell me the truth. Am I a female fog bank?
ORIGINAL CINDY: You're not seriously buying into Darren's nonsense.
MAX: No.
ORIGINAL CINDY: He was just trying to blame you 'cause he's a slut.
MAX: Yeah.
ORIGINAL CINDY: Hell yeah. There's not the slightest grain of truth in anything that idiot was saying. You are a totally down-ass female and a straight-up friend who happens to be a little...
MAX: A little what?
ORIGINAL CINDY: You know what I'm saying.
MAX: If I knew what you were saying, I wouldn't be asking.
ORIGINAL CINDY: How long you and me known each other?
MAX: A long time.
ORIGINAL CINDY: Long enough for you to pretty much read me like a book, right?
MAX: Because you're probably my closest friend in the whole world.
ORIGINAL CINDY: And back at ya. Only there's a part of you that's... I don't know--
MAX: A fog bank.
ORIGINAL CINDY: More like a mystery... Which isn't bad. It's just kinduv...mysterious...
MAX: Gotta go.
ORIGINAL CINDY: Where?
MAX: It's a secret.
VOGELSANG: I asked you to keep that thing outside.
MAX: You did.
VOGELSANG: You drive away business roarin' in like that.
MAX: Yeah, does kinda break the elegant atmosphere you got goin' on here.
VOGELSANG: You got a punk-ass mouth on you, kid.
MAX: My name's not kid. It's client. As in the person who pays for your opulent lifestyle. Now, you got something for me or not?
VOGELSANG: Right here someplace.
VOGELSANG: I got a hit on the car. An oh-five Tahoe, blue, with Wyoming tags... AGT349... It wasn't easy 'cause you were off in one of the numbers.
MAX: Sorry, I was seven at the time.
MAX: Who's this guy? This isn't who we're looking for...her name was Hannah.
VOGELSANG: He got the car in a trade for his old pick-up and some food...no bill of sale or nothing. It was right after the pulse so all the DMV records were wiped. So we don't get anything on the seller. Except I actually managed to find this guy, six hours on the phone... Say thank you.
MAX: Thank you.
VOGELSANG: He says he got it from a woman. Doesn't remember her name but she fits the description you gave like a glove.
