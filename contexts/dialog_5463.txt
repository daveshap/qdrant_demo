CAITLIN: I'm sorry for whatever's happened to you but we're definitely not the right people to do you any good.
LENORE: Don't you have children?
CAITLIN: Matter of fact I did have a kid once. But he's a lot better off with his father in Milwaukee.
KLINGER: Have you got to tell her your life story?
CAITLIN: This is my conversation. I'll say what I fucking please.
KLINGER: Wake up. Make a right at Ocean Avenue. The hotel's a few blocks up on the left.
THEO: I know where it is. Give me that phone back.
CAITLIN: I'm not finished. Under other circumstances I'd gladly go out of my way. I don't understand why you just don't phone some other person.
THEO: She can't! It's busted. Now hand that on back!
CAITLIN: Theo wants to talk again.
THEO: Did you have to tell her my name?
LENORE: Theo?""
THEO: Forget who I am. Where's this school located?
LENORE: 26th off Wilshire.
THEO: Even if I got there first she wouldn't go with me.
LENORE: She would if she heard my voice on the phone.
