JACQUES: What's wrong?
JOHANA: It's nothing. Just the long trip. I'm a little jet-lagged.
JACQUES: You want to lie down for a while?
JOHANA: No, I'll be fine. Can you just hand me a glass of water?
ENZO: Is he here?
ROBERTO: He's training.
ENZO: Okay, now we have a good five minutes to have a nice peaceful talk.
JOHANA: What are you doing here?
ENZO: Checking out the competition.
JOHANA: Enzo, why do you guys do this?
ENZO: What else is there?
JOHANA: You know what I'm talking about.
ENZO: You risk your life when you cross the street.
JOHANA: Damn it! Why won't you give me a straight answer, for once?!
ENZO: Because you'd laugh.
JOHANA: I won't, I swear.
ENZO: I dive in search of God. If I go deep enough I'm going to find him.
JOHANA: A little... You think it's the same for Jacques?
ENZO: No. Jacques is a creature of the sea. He isn't meant to live on earth, among us... You should know this, Johana.
JOHANA: He can learn. He is learning.
ENZO: You really think so? Did you tell him you were pregnant?
JOHANA: How do you know that?
ENZO: You told Bonita, but you didn't tell him, right?
JOHANA: ... Not yet.
ENZO: Don't.
JOHANA: Why?
ENZO: Because he won't understand and it will just hurt you... Jacques has been put on earth by complete mistake. And he's only waiting for one thing: that some God up there will turn him into a fish! How long has that moron been down there?
JOHANA: Five minutes and fifty seconds.
ENZO: That idiot!
JOHANA: Is he alright? What happened?
ENZO: The fool was asleep! If I weren't around, he'd already be dead!!! Is that who you want to live with?
JACQUES: ... How long was I asleep?
ENZO: Long enough to die. Listen, if you really want to die, that's your problem, but don't do it under my nose, okay?
