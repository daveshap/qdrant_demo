HOFFY: Three's a crowd, especially if you've got to cut your way through barbed wire. Here's the wire cutters. Are the civilian clothes ready?
BLONDIE: Coming up.
HOFFY: Get going on the trap door.
PRICE: What do you say, Hoffy. We'll hit the air raid trenches and cut out in back of Barracks nine.
HOFFY: You'd better cut out in back of the south latrine.
PRICE: Why the south latrine?
HOFFY: Because that's where he is. In the water tank.
