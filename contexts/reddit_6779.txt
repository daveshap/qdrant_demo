Should I follow up with a temp job recruiter after he submitted me for four different positions?
This past week I was accepted as an applicant for the temp department that fills vacancies at a local college. The recruiter there had four different openings he submitted me for. I only heard back from one of them (and got an interview). 

I'm not sure if I haven't heard back from the others because they weren't interested or because they were already out for the holidays since the semester had ended. 

I don't want to appear desperate or become a nuisance, but I'm curious about where I might stand with those other three positions. I also wonder if I won't be able to get in touch until the beginning of January.
