LAURIE: Now, I want you to walk to the door, down the stairs and right out the front door.
LINDSEY: You're coming with us...
LAURIE: Listen to me. I want you to walk down the street to the MacKensie's and knock on their door. You tell them to call the police and send them over here. Do you understand?
TOMMY: Laurie, you come with us...
LAURIE: No! Do as I say.
