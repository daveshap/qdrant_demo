Why am I so tired and unmotivated!?
Aye what’s up so I’m 17 and I’m actually doing pretty good mentally, like I feel pretty happy where as I normally don’t but it’s weird because even though I feel happy I’m extremely tired no matter how much I sleep I’m tired and I just wanna sleep all day and all night I’m that tired, I have zero energy and I’m unmotivated. I wouldn’t say I’m depressed by any means because I do feel happy! I’m really confused. I’m taking vitamins and vitamin d supplements because I went to my doctor and they said it’s bevause my vitamin d is low but I’ve been on these supplements for two weeks now and if anything I feel more tired.
