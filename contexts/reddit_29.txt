I had sex with someone older than me
Sorry if formatting is bad, on mobile 

So me and this guy met on Twitter, we had a shared interest in the same band so we started talking and it was going well. We talked about our favourite songs and general stuff about the band and other interests. We got onto the topic of where we lived and we realised we were somewhat close to each other, so we decided to meet up. 

So we met up and all was well, we talked about a bunch of things, walked around etc, eventually we got to this secluded place and just had a deep conversation and then things got pretty intimate pretty fast and the next thing you know we were having sex. 

Afterwards i walked him back to the bus stop and as we where going through where i lived he commented about how it looked like a military base, he then talked about how he was going to Uni and then going to join the military or something. I was kind of internally freaking out at that point because i thought he was around my age (15-16) and not 18+. I think he thought i was around 17-18 and not fucking 15, cause he made a remark about me “STILL” living with my parents. 

I have no fucking clue what to do, i feel as though i should just ghost him and pretend like this never happened.
