BASIL EXPOSITION: Hello, Austin. This is Basil Exposition, Chief of British Intelligence. You're Austin Powers, International Man of Mystery, and you're with Agent Mrs. Kensington. The year is 1967, and you're talking on a picture phone.
AUSTIN: We know all that, Exposition.
BASIL EXPOSITION: I just wanted to be extremely clear so that everyone knows what's going on at any given time. We've just received word that Dr. Evil, the ultimate square, is planning to take over the world.
AUSTIN: Dr. Evil? I thought I put him in jail for good.
BASIL EXPOSITION: I'm afraid not. Earlier this week, Dr. Evil escaped from Zedel Edel Prison in Baaden Baaden and now he's planning a trap for you tonight at the Electric Psychedelic Pussycat Swinger's Club in Picadilly Circus here in swinging London.
AUSTIN: Just where you'd never think to look for him. We'll be there.
BASIL EXPOSITION: Good luck, Austin.
AUSTIN: Thank you.
BASIL EXPOSITION: Oh, and Austin...
AUSTIN: Yes?
BASIL EXPOSITION: Be careful.
AUSTIN: Thank you. Let's go, baby!
