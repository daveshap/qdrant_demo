JAKE: Alright! Hold up. You win. You got the job.
LILY: Gee thanks. Now I don't have to find that bridge to jump off.
JAKE: We had to see what your deal was. I'm just a little superstitious.
LILY: Here's my deal -- Don't waste my time. What do you want me for anyway? You don't even know me.
JAKE: I just have a good feeling about you. Haven't you ever had someone say they had a good feeling about you before?
LILY: No. What's my cut?
JAKE: You get an equal cut.
LILY: What do I have to do?
JAKE: Just play a part. A little acting.
