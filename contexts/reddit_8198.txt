[META] To Those Joining Us From TrendingSubbreddits
First of all, welcome! 

We're glad that you have decided to explore our little home. Please remember, however, that the rules for discussion on /r/NeutralPolitics are much stricter than elsewhere on reddit in order to protect the standard of discourse that we Neutrons value. 

The [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/pteu5/meta_rneutralpolitics_frequently_asked_questions/) and [guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines) are required reading before you start posting and will give you a better understanding of who we are and what we are about. 

And if you are interested in submitting a question please note our submission rules (also covered in guidelines):

#Submission Rules

We [require the following for submitting new posts:](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_submission_rules)

A) **Ask a specific political question as the basis for discussion.** We do not permit overly broad questions, solicitations of pure opinion, posts about other subreddits, or meta posts.

B) **Frame it in a neutral way.**  The post must not be  leading towards a particular answer, nor be inflammatory, editorialized, a statement of your own personal views, or a request to critique your theory.

C) **Outline the issue well.**  Give more than just a headline, there must be some background on the question.

D) **Provide sources.**  Just like for comments, new submissions need to source the facts which underlie their question.

E) **Propose a good starting point for discussion.** The purpose of this forum is to promote quality discussion.

F) **Title your post accurately.**  The title of the post and its contents must match.

G) **No requests for speculation.** If the question can't be answered with facts, then it's not appropriate for NeutralPolitics.

The [voting guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/ptgxf/meta_rneutralpolitics_guide_to_downvoting_and/) is also very useful since we have a different attitude about what is worthy of upvotes or downvotes than most subreddits (Namely, *don't downvote someone just because you disagree with them!*).

If you have any questions, feel free to ask away. Otherwise, enjoy the subreddit and don't forget your [facts](https://theinfosphere.org/images/3/39/Title_Caption_Episode_0621.png)!
