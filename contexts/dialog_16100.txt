GEORGE: I'm good, thanks.
BRYAN: What are you on?
GEORGE: Pardon me?
BRYAN: how much weight have you lost?
GEORGE: Oh...nothing. Thirty pounds. I just haven't been very hungry.
BRYAN: How's your wife?
GEORGE: When we divorce a decade ago, she was very, very angry. Now she's just hostile.
BRYAN: Right...she married...what was he?
GEORGE: He buys and sells the world.
BRYAN: Peter Webber! Right. Quite the spotlight on that guy.
GEORGE: I did tell you, didn't I? That I'd be ready to start the Berlin model today?
BRYAN: Well, that's sort of...you're sure you're not hungry?
BRYAN: This isn't me. We can show clients endless options, change anything in a matter of hours on the computer. But you won't change.
GEORGE: Typing and clicking myself to renderings isn't why I started building models.
BRYAN: All of us are typing and clicking, George. Whether we want to, or not.
GEORGE: I'm not.
BRYAN: Which is why we bid out a quarter of our projects. It doesn't make a lot of sense anymore to want what we don't have and don't want what we do.
GEORGE: I've been here twenty years.
BRYAN: Maybe that's too long.
GEORGE: Maybe...?
BRYAN: That's too long.
