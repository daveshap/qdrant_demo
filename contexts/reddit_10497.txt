I crochet a blanket for my boyfriend to say goodbye
I have been planning my suicide for a while now and today is finally the day I will be happy. A couple of months ago I asked my boyfriend to choose a colour palette but I didn't tell him that it was for the colours of yarn I will use to make a blanket for him as a goodbye gift. I've been working really hard on this blanket and trying to make it perfect. Before I wrap it I will spray it with my perfume that I always wear and tuck the bottle in the blanket so he can spray it on whenever it loses the smell. With it I will also write a letter to explain why I'm giving him this gift.
