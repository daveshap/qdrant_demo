Why do Funded PhD Students "Pay" for Tuition?
I understand paying for tuition if you have to take some classes before you do your phd research, but when you're in your upper years, why do the schools still consider themselves "paying" for tuition?  

Likewise, what monetary gain do universities get for teaching grad students beyond teaching assistantships? 

Edit: I'm getting the impression that it's not well known and differs greatly by institution, yet it's weird because it's an industry-wide practice.
