BANDIT: The bus'll pick you up over there. Uh... you got enough bread for a ticket?
KATE: Enough to get to Jersey. I'll walk the rest of the way. I've been sitting a long time. Nice meeting you. It's been a trip.
BANDIT: Hey...
KATE: Enjoy your Kenworth.
WAITRESS: What's your pleasure?
BANDIT: Couple of cheeseburgers, no condiments...
WAITRESS: No what?
BANDIT: Nothing on 'em and two cups of mud; one while I'm waiting.
