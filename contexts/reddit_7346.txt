Don't know how to approach getting schooling, training or maybe even a mentor?
 I'm 32 year old male from Michigan. I have been working in produce for  about 9 months. Took a test just recently I passed the reading. Just  need to be brushed up on the math. If I want them to pay for schooling.  Don't even know where to get started? My testing said I was  enterprising. Just seems like everything I want to do. Takes four years  and do not want to be in debt. With apprenticeships seem like there  physically demanding. I'm type 1 diabetic and do not. Want to bottom out  while working. I mean I like the idea of trading. Which would be cool  if I had a mentor. Analysts perhaps I feel like if I'm the best I should be making. The money to show for it. I mean wondering where the future is going. And how to tap in on it. Skys the limit any ideas?
