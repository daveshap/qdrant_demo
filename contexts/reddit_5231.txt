How can I learn or become more assertive?
Hi friends! A little background about me.. I am a 20F that works at a daycare as the administrative assistant. I handle all of the calls, scheduling, paperwork etc.. I am an extremely nice person and hate to give people a hard time. Long story short, I have this one lady that likes to test me being admin. I feel as though she doesn’t take me serious because of my age. Because of this, things have been slipping &I need to handle it. How can I become more assertive? I am a naturally shy person but with my career field (Business with a focus in healthcare) I NEED to know how to speak up🤦🏽‍♀️ please help. I am willing to look at YouTube videos, trainings, anything.
