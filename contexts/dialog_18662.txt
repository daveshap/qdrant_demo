MUMFORD: Where's your wife, Henry?
FOLLETT: Go to hell.
MUMFORD: I didn't hear you.
FOLLETT: We got divorced. I had to get rid of her. She couldn't satisfy me.
MUMFORD: What?!
FOLLETT: I was... never satisfied.
MUMFORD: Now we're back on track.
MUMFORD: What's that?
FOLLETT: You are so mean.
MUMFORD: Hey, Skip.
SKIP: Doc. I know we're not supposed to get together till Wednesday...
MUMFORD: That's all right. What's on your mind?
SKIP: How many sessions have we had now, Doc? Six. And it's been good... like we were two buddies hanging out. Just shootin' the shit.
MUMFORD: Yep.
