KIMBALL: So...there's nothing you can tell me about Paul Owen?
BATEMAN: He led what I suppose was an orderly life. He... ate a balanced diet.
KIMBALL: What kind of man was he? Besides... the information you've just given.
BATEMAN: I hope I'm not being cross-examined here.
KIMBALL: Do you feel that way?
BATEMAN: No. Not really.
KIMBALL: Where did Paul hang out?
BATEMAN: Hang...out?
KIMBALL: Yeah. You know...hang out.
BATEMAN: Let me think. The Newport. Harry's. Fluties. Endochine. Nell's. Comell Club. The New York Yacht Club. The regular places.
KIMBALL: He had a yacht?
BATEMAN: No, he just hung out there.
KIMBALL: And where did he go to school?
BATEMAN: Don't you know this?
KIMBALL: I just wanted to know if you know. BATEMAN Before Yale? If I remember correctly, Saint Paul's... Listen, I just...I just want to help.
