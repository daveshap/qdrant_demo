STELLA: You really are a gambler.
PADEN: Give me some of the good stuff.
MAL: Hello, Rae.
RAE: What are you doing here? I thought you were done with our family.
MAL: Daddy's dead.
MAL: He was murdered.
RAE: Who did it?
MAL: I'm not sure, but I got an idea. And when I am sure, they're going to pay.
RAE: Oh that's just fine. Where were you when Ma and Daddy needed you? It's too late, Mal. Now you finally show up and all you can think of is to get yourself killed.
