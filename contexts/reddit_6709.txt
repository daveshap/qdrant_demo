How to find recruiters to work with?
I’m on the job hunt.  I never really utilized my college’s resources well for career counseling in school, so I feel at a loss with any kind of strategy. I worked with a wonderful woman who helped me put together a stellar resume, and I know I need to tailor my cover letter to each company I apply to. But I just feel at a loss of what to do. I studied mathematics in college (B.A. degree) because I was absolutely in love with the subject. I didn’t take very many applied courses and I am regretting that so much now. I have no idea what direction to go in. I’m willing to try just about anything. But a big caveat is that I have a compromised immune system so with everything happening globally and locally I would like to be able to work from home for the time being, or within a non-public space (was previously working retail). I don’t know anything about working with recruiters, but this keeps popping up in different conversations and online. Could this be helpful? What does this entail? I just don’t know what to do right now. Any and all advice helps. Thank you in advance!
