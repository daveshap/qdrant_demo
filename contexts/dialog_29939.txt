JENNY: Hey, Mister. You gotta quarter?
JOHN: What?
JENNY: I wanna play a song on the juke. You got a quarter?
JENNY: What happened to your hand?
JOHN: Accident, and yeah, I got to be more careful.
JENNY: Got any requests?
JOHN: That country shit all sounds the same to me.
JENNY: How about I pick one out for you?
JENNY: You like Patsy Cline? I just love her. How come, I wonder, she don't put out no more new records.
JOHN: She's dead.
JENNY: Gee, that's sad. Don't that make you sad?
JOHN: I've had time to get over it.
JENNY: You're not from around here, are you? Where you from?
JOHN: Oz.
JENNY: You ain't from Oz. Oz is in that one movie.
JOHN: You're too quick for me.
