Started my new job today and I am an imposter!
Today I started a brand new job across the country. A win! It’s in a city I’ve always wanted to live, decent pay (for my field), in the field I studied in college, and has a strong work/life balance (they tout...it was my first day after all). And I came to the realization that I definitely skipped a few steps in my career.

I work in politics. I worked a few internships and did a single campaign on the lowest level, and in college I flipped burgers and rolled burritos. But talking to the other new hires and my coworkers, and they have so many years of experience as field directors and campaign managers. I am starting a little later than the other new hires (they started last Wednesday), so the last few days of their training coincides with the first days of my training (we’re literally in the same trainings, advanced versions of what they covered last week). I feel totally unprepared, dumb, and unqualified.

What should I do?
