To move out or to move out (ADVICE PLS)
I’ve been wanting to move out for a few years now, I just feel like I’m meant for so much bigger- that I can’t achieve living with my parents and little sister who depend solely on me (I feel like I’m exaggerating writing this but it is what it is) I love my parents to bits, honestly. But they took it really hard when I told them tonight

A bit of how it went in the past:
My mother was stuck overseas for a bit right around the time I started Uni and I wanted to move out so I didn’t have to take buses (that varied from 1-1.5 hours to get from A to B) and my dad said it was fine (after a bit of maybes and NEVERRRR) and told me to stay til mum could come back so I could support my little sister who was in grade 5 . 

Long story short, it’s been a year now and they hate it when I bring up moving out.

Present: I told them I wanted to move out tonight, and they totally lost their balls... bringing up how I don’t want to raise my parents now that I’m working now, and how their kids aren’t turning out like the “good” kids they raised and I felt it tug at my heart strings. 

They said all sorts of things from blaming how I hang out with my friends once and want to move out, to how I want to go out (clubbing, be free)  that’s why Iwant to leave and it hurt.

Like whaddafuckkkk

I don’t usually care about this shit, but after my brother knocked up his mrs and moved out, my parents haven’t been the same and my dads in his late sixties so idk if me leaving will trigger his death.. ijdfk yknow?

And I feel super guilty about wanting to move out with a mate before the weekend comes. Because 1) they’re old 2) were poor 3) I’m kinda their breadwinner 4) it’s tradition as an islander 5) fck my life lol

I feel like I’d rather jump off a bridge rn

This feeling is so uncomfortable. Honestly

Help?
