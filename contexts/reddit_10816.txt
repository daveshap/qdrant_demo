They found him
My ex boyfriend of 5 years and best friend of 6 killed himself about a week ago and they just found his body in the woods. I feel like everything I touch dies, this is my third friend who has killed themselves. I can’t even begin to figure out how to process this. I’d used to call him on my bad nights and he’d talk me down and he promised he’d be here and alive as long as I was. I feel like it’s my fault, I feel such an immense amount of guilt for neglecting him in his final week, almost taunting him. I can’t stop crying unless I turn back to substances but I know he wouldn’t want it like this. I can’t help. Those five fucking words destroyed me.
