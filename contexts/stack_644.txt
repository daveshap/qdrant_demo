Network Connection Icon not shown I am unable to install purevpn on Ubuntu MATE 16.04 because I cannot find the Network Connection Icon. I have fumbled around with no positive results. My goal is to install Purevpn. I need a very clear set of instructions as I am not really good at this. Please help. Thank you.The closest thing to the network connection icon is a bar graph icon that lists the wifi and ethernet
