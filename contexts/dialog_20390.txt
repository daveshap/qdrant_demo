MAURICE: Watch the road, boy. I like this Town Car. We can cruise the man's neighbourhood without getting the police or private security people on our ass.
GLENN: Sure, right, they see Bigfoot driving around a black guy wearing shades and a lavender fucking bandanna, no, they won't think anything of it.
MAURICE: It's lilac, man, the color, and the style's made known by Deion and other defensive backs in the pros. I could be one of them living out here with doctors of my race and basketball players. Okay, here comes Mr. Ripley's house up on the left. Yeah. The brick wall. There's his drive, right there.
MAURICE: You sure Foley and his pal aren't coming up here, do this themself?
GLENN: If they're not busted now, they're gonna be. It's wide open.
GLENN: So you still haven't said, how you wanna do it?
MAURICE: I'll show you, soon as I get one more guy I'm gonna need, Moselle's brother, Kenneth. Along with White Boy there.
GLENN: What?
