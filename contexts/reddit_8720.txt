What independent evidence corroborates or refutes the allegations made via the recent James O'Keefe video?
Conservative activist James O'Keefe [recently released a pair of videos](http://time.com/4536212/james-okeefe-project-veritas-video-democrats/) depicting conversations with a number of people depicted to hold various positions with the DNC and Democratic-affiliated SuperPacs.

The videos are used to indicate that the people recorded have organized and paid others to violently disrupt Donald Trump rallies, and to engage in voter fraud.

O'Keefe has a history of producing sensational videos, often sparking investigations which find that the videos [have been heavily and deceptively edited.](http://www.snopes.com/2016/10/18/project-veritas-election-videos/)

[At least two people depicted in the videos, Robert Creamer and Scott Foval have resigned or been fired.](http://www.snopes.com/2016/10/19/scott-foval-reportedly-fired-from-political-organization-over-sting-videos/)

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IuJGHuIkzY) is the first video.  [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDc8PVCvfKs) is the second.

So my question is, as the title states: what independent evidence is there to corroborate or refute the allegations made, both specifically as to the persons involved, and more generally as to the tactics described in the videos being tactics that are in fact used in recent elections?

I am submitting this in my capacity as a NeutralPolitics mod because we have had a number of people submit questions about the videos but they have not been sufficiently compliant with the rules to go live.
