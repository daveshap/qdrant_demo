I've been hopelessly infatuated with a girl for 3 years. I know what I need to do, but I don't know how.
I know I need to tell her how I feel,  no hope for anything if I don't, but how? And what then? If she says no should I distance myself from her? I have spent every hour for 3 years thinking about this girl. I asked her out 2 years ago and she rejected me then, I doubt things have changed, but I'll never find out unless I ask. We're very good friends and I value our friendship very much. 

I don't know any way to express my feelings to her though. I'm better at text communication, but that seems insincere.

Sorry for this not being very well constructed, I'm trying to figure it out myself.
