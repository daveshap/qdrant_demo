Complicated scary af situation
Im 14, male. So I've been friends with this guy since grade 5 and yeah i sleep over at his house every now and then but the problem is cringey but im not sure if its ok... my heart says yes but my mind says fuck it. Ive been through one or two relationships and I've learnt enough to know that im not very outgoing. But I've kinda fallen for his sister. But she's 16 and i live around 40 km away (over a mountain) and i dont know what do do. And my friend is going to boarding school for highschool from this year on so i don't know when i could see her (if it even happens) and im like family to their family and i dont even think that her dad approves of dating, much less of dating a child younger than her. But she gave me hugs and stuff when i help her out when im at my friends house
In my eyes she's almost perfect. 
She watches GoT, and TWD.
She's beautiful.
Sweet.
Kind. 
Loves videogames.
Has my sense of humor.
She isnt shallow or rude. 
And she stays up till 3 am with me playing games and watching movies when my friend goes to bed.
What do i do. Ive never really been scared in a relationship (or just a crush) but damn. Im scared. I don't want to ruin things between my friend or his sister. my friend leaves for school this sunday. Please help me :(

Edit: i didnt even use my throwaway :/
