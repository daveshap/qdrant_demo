MARLA: Where have you been the last few weeks?
JACK: Marla?
JACK: How did you find me?
MARLA: The forwarding number. I haven't seen you at any support groups.
JACK: That's the idea -- we split them.
MARLA: You haven't been going to yours.
JACK: I found a new one.
MARLA: Really?
JACK: It's for men.
MARLA: Like testicular cancer?
JACK: Look, this is a bad time...
MARLA: I've been going to debtor's anonymous. You want to see some truly fucked up people?
JACK: I'm just on my way out...
MARLA: Me too. I got a stomach full of Xanax. I took what was left of a bottle. Might've been too much.
JACK: Picture yourself watching Marla Singer throw herself around her crummy apartment.
MARLA: This isn't a for-real suicide thing. This is probably one of those cry-for- help things.
JACK: This could go on for hours.
JACK: So you're staying in tonight?
MARLA: Do you want to wait to hear me describe death?
