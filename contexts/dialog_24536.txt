JERRY: Well, that solves one problem. We don't have to worry about who to pay first.
JOE: Quiet - I'm thinking.
JERRY: Of course, the landlady is going to lock us out - Moe said no more knackwurst on credit - and we can't borrow any more from the girls, because they're on their way to jail -
JOE: Shut up, will you? I wonder how much Sam the Bookie will give up for our overcoats?
JERRY: Sam the Bookie? Nothing doing! You're not putting my overcoat on that dog!
JOE: I told you - it's a sure thing.
JERRY: But we'll freeze - it's below zero - we'll catch pneumonia.
JOE: Look, stupid, he's ten to one. Tomorrow, we'll have twenty overcoats!
JERRY: Greased Lightning! Why do I listen to you? I ought to have my head examined!
JOE: I thought you weren't talking to me.
JERRY: Look at the bull fiddle - it's dressed warmer than I am.
