I'm feel like I'm underpaid and the only one who cares about working.
Hi, this is my first post here, I hope I don't break any rules! 

My name is Phil and I have been a retail worker for a big company for the last 6 months. I am paid the minimum amount and working full time. I never really asked any questions because I am not very experienced with working yet (I am 19). People tell me I am good at my job, one of the best where I work and I'm glad. 

However, my new colleague told me that I am severly underpaid for the amount of work I do in the store. Basically I do most of the stuff myself and my other coworkers don't take the job seriously, using their phones while supposed to be working. My manager is always looking for new people to replace them, but very few people want to work there and my coworkers are using this at their advantage. I think am someone who is very loyal, which is why I didn't look for something else all that time. 

I am starting to slowly hate my job here because I do a lot alone. I hate the fact that other coworkers are paid way more than I am while doing almost nothing. I work 40 hours a week at 12$ an hour. 

With Black Friday and the Holidays coming up, I would feel bad quitting and I don't think it would be good for any future job, but showing up every morning and doing the job that wasn't done while I was gone is excruciating.

Do you guys have any advice?
