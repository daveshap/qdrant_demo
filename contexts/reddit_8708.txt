A couple of key excerpts:

>The recording, made by Cohen, was seized by federal agents now investigating Trump’s longtime confidant for potential bank and campaign finance crimes, according to multiple familiar with the probe.  
>  
>  
>  
>Trump and Cohen discussed the possible payment after AMI, the parent company of the National Enquirer, bought the rights to McDougal’s story for $150,000 in August 2016, then sat on it.  
>  
>  
>  
>But the recording shows that Trump — whose spokeswoman denied he had any knowledge of the AMI deal with McDougal when it became public days before the election — in fact knew of her claims and efforts to keep her quiet at least two months earlier.

The recording was seized by the FBI when they raided Cohen’s office [a few months back](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/federal-probe-into-trumps-lawyer-seeks-records-about-two-women-who-alleged-affairs-with-the-president/2018/04/10/624104a2-3cda-11e8-a7d1-e4efec6389f0_story.html?utm_term=.1b33bcc0c65d).

>In the United States. **Attorney**–**client** **privilege** is a legal concept that protects communications between a **client** and his or her **attorney** and keeps those communications confidential, in both civil and criminal cases. This **privilege** encourages open and honest communication between **clients** and **attorneys**.
