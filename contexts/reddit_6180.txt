New job, business professional dress code?
Just got a new job with a consulting firm in Dallas. I start in two weeks. The onboarding documents state that the dress code is business professional, ie suit and tie. Although everyone I saw while interviewing left the jackets off.

Does anyone have some wardrobe suggestions that will get me through the first few weeks until my first paycheck at least? I just graduated in December so Iâ€™m still on a tight student budget.

Also I have fairly long hair, which I kept tied back in the interviews. I never really pressed the issue but should I just go ahead and cut it to something more clean cut and professional?
