MARTINS: Tactful too, aren't we, Callaghan?
CALLOWAY: Calloway.
ANNA: Must you take those letters? CALLOWAY Yes, I'm afraid so.
ANNA: They're Harry's.
CALLOWAY: That's the reason.
ANNA: You won't learn anything from them. They are only love letters. There are not many of them.
CALLOWAY: They'll be returned to you, Miss Schmidt, as soon as they've been examined.
ANNA: There's nothing in them.
