I want to die but don't want to kill myself
Therapist says I'm being too extreme but honestly, I'm just too average at everything to be happy with myself. I'm too dumb to get any of the jobs I want to actually have and I'm too smart to be able to settle for something menial and be fufilled. I'm not depressed enough to need serious intervention but I'm not stable enough to be truly without it. I'm average at everything or worse. I can never achieve what I want to because i am simply not intelligent enough. I don't even have the will power to end everything. I'm just pathetic and weak.
