SETH: Sight seein'.
RICHARD: What'd ya see?
SETH: Cops.
RICHARD: Didya look at the border?
SETH: Yeah, I saw the border. Through binoculars from on top of a high building. That's about as close as I risked getting. What's the TV say?
RICHARD: They're going to apprehend us in forty-eight hours.
SETH: I gotta figure a way to get across that goddamn border. Longer we fuck around El Paso our lives ain't worth a shit.
RICHARD: Look, fuck the border. Let's just dig in and wait for things to cool down.
SETH: Richie, it's gonna get a lot fuckin' worse before it gets any fuckin' better. We showed our ass in Texas. We killed Texas fuckin' Rangers. They ain't gonna stop lookin' till they find us, and when they find us, they're gonna kill us. Texans take it very personal when ya kill their law enforcement officers. The El Paso police have already started a motel and hotel search for us.
RICHARD: How do you know?
SETH: I heard it on the radio. We gotta get our asses into Mexico tonight. Carlos is gonna meet us tomorrow morning at a rendezvous on the other side, then Carlos and his boys will escort us to El Ray and --

RICHARD: She's in the other room.
SETH: What the fuck is she doin' there?!
