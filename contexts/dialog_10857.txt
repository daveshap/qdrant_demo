VENKMAN: Damn!
DANA: Are you all right?
VENKMAN: Yeah, yeah.
VENKMAN: There's nothing there now and I don't get any significant readings.
DANA: This is terrible. Either there's a monster in my kitchen or I'm completely crazy.
VENKMAN: If it's any comfort to you, I don't think you're crazy.
DANA: Thanks. Coming from you that really means a lot to me.
VENKMAN: I'm a qualified psychologist. I've got a degree and everything. I believe that something happened here and I want to do something about it.
DANA: All right. What do you want to do?
VENKMAN: I think I should spend the night here.
DANA: That's it. Get out.
VENKMAN: On a purely scientific basis.
DANA: Out!
VENKMAN: I want to help you.
DANA: I'll scream.
VENKMAN: Don't scream.
DANA: Then leave.
VENKMAN: Okay, okay. But if anything else happens, you have to promise you'll call me.
DANA: All right.
VENKMAN: Okay. Then I'll go.
DANA: Goodbye.
VENKMAN: No kiss?
STANTZ: How was your date?
VENKMAN: It wasn't a date. It was an investigation.
SPENGLER: Did you see anything?
VENKMAN: Didn't see anything, Didn't get anything. Nice girl - no ghost. I'm starting to worry. You said your graph was pointing to something big. You told me things were going to start popping.
STANTZ: They will.
VENKMAN: Do you know when that might be? We're on the brink of a very serious cash-flow problem.
BRIDE: Aren't you glad we waited?
GROOM: I don't know. It probably would've been the same.
BRIDE: Well, thanks a lot.
