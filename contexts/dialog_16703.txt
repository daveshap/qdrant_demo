QUINCY: What will this prove?
MONICA: You once said the reason I beat you was because you wanted me to.
QUINCY: So?
MONICA: So, if I win it's because deep down you know you're about to make the biggest mistake of your life, and deep down your want me to stop you.
QUINCY: And what happens when you lose?
MONICA: If I lose, I'll buy you a wedding present.
