Prospective students point of contact
Hi, all. I'm an admin assistant in Undergrad student affairs. I'm noticing that some prospective students email me themselves, while others let a parent or guardian be the main point of contact. I would love to encourage these students to contact me themselves, as it will definitely help their chances of admission.

Any experience with this? How might I do this in a gentle and positive way?
