What are the pros and cons of raising the income tax on the highest earners?
I was doing some research for an unrelated topic and I came upon the following statistics for the [2016 federal income tax revenue](https://taxfoundation.org/summary-latest-federal-income-tax-data-2016-update/). The main figures I wanted to discuss are those showing that the rich pay an extraordinarily higher share of income tax compared to the amount of income they receive. The ratios for the various taxpaying percentiles are here:

* The top 1% pays 27.16%, or 13% more than the average taxpayer, as well as 39.48% of the total federal income tax.

* The top 5% pays 23.61%, or 9.45% more than the average taxpayer, as well as 59.97% of the federal income tax,

* The top 50% pays 15.52%, or 1.36% more than the average taxpayer, as well as *97.25%* of the federal income tax.

What are the pros and cons of raising income tax on the rich, and is there a moral dilemma with the minority of Americans paying the large majority of Income Tax?

Thanks in advance for the response.
