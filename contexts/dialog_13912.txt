CLAUDIA: You... fed on me?
LOUIS: And he found me with you. I ran, sickened at what I'd done. Then he cut his wrist and fed you from him. I tried to stop him, but you were a vampire then. And have been every night hereafter.
CLAUDIA: You both did it?
LOUIS: I took your life. He gave you another one.
