DAVID LEE: Can you say what camp they gon' send you to, Daddy?
NATHAN LEE: I don't know, son -- they won't tell us things like that -- but I don't want y'all to come here no more.
DAVID LEE: Why, Daddy; you won't be here?
NATHAN LEE: Just do like I tell you -- I'll get word to you through the visitin' preacher.
