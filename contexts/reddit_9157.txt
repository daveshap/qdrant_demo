Reached a goal today! Got $1000.00 in savings account!
Sat down and paid the rest of the bills for the month, transferred some money to the savings account and I still have over $1000.00 balance in my checking account.

Things aren't perfect, I have several thousand in medical bills that have been sent to collections to work through, but I decided to get a cushion built up because shit happens.

I've come a long way from eating peanut crackers for lunch just to get through the week. So if you are wondering if the struggle and saving are worth it.....yes it is.

Thanks to everyone who posted their success because that is what kept me going.
