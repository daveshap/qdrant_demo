HEATHER DUKE: Hi everyone, door was open. Veronica, you missed it! Pauline and Whitney James were up there doing there suicide rap when the cops come in and announce that Martha Dumptruck tried to buy the farm. She gave the ticket girl at the Colfax theatre a suicide note then bellyflopped in front of a car.
VERONICA: Is she dead?
HEATHER DUKE: That's the punchline. She's still alive, in stable condition. Another case of a geek trying to imitate the popular people of the school and failing miserably. Is that pate?
VERONICA: I said I was sorry.
HEATHER DUKE: You are out of control. Heather and Kurt were a shock, but Martha Dumptruck, get crucial! She dialed suicide hotlines in her diapers.
VERONICA: You're not funny. Ouch!
HEATHER DUKE: What. A. Martyr. Understand; Martha couldn't take the heat so she got out of the kitchen. Just think what a better place the world would be if every nimrod followed her cue.
VERONICA: Just shut up and turn on the radio. Hot Probs is on.
HEATHER DUKE: Oh shit, yeah.
