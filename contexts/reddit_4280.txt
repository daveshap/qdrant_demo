How are some people always able to bounce from relationship and never be single?
I’m fed up of always being alone. I honestly don’t know what’s wrong with me. Maybe I sound conceited for saying this but I don’t think I’m ugly and am jealous of those women I’ve known that always have men flock to them and I’m alone/invisible. I’m told I’m attractive and have lost all this weight to STILL END UP UNNOTICED. I don’t have any close friends and use dating apps because that’s the only connection I can make with the lack of people I know. I get messages but generally from guys I don’t want to pursue. And if the guy I do like messages me, THEY TYPICALLY STOP MESSAGING ME. I settled with the last guy I saw and refuse to make an exception for my standards oncemore. I’m fat and I’m alone. I’m skinnier and I’m alone. Short hair or long hair and still alone. What will it take to attract a guy that I like?
