I don't want to go to work tonight. I feel like I can't say no and do whatever I want.
I just don't want to go. But I feel like I can't tell them "no" I don't want to come in. I feel like my life belongs to that job and I can't do whatever I want anymore. I hate my work life. I wish I found a stable career by now that fits me but it's just too hard.
