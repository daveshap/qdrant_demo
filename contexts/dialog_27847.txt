SONNY: Tom, you're the Consigliere, what do we do if the old man dies?
HAGEN: Without your father's political contacts and personal influence, the Corleone family loses half its strength. Without your father, the other New York families might wind up supporting Sollozzo, and the Tattaglias just to make sure there isn't a long destructive war. The old days are over, this is 1946; nobody wants bloodshed anymore. If your father dies...make the deal, Sonny.
SONNY: That's easy to say; it's not your father.
HAGEN: I was as good a son to him as you or Mike.
SONNY: Oh Christ Tom, I didn't mean it that way.
HAGEN: We're all tired...
SONNY: OK, we sit tight until the old man can give us the lead. But Tom, I want you to stay inside the Mall. You too, Mike, no chances. Tessio, you hold your people in reserve, but have them nosing around the city. The hospital is yours; I want it tight, fool-proof, 24 hours a day.
