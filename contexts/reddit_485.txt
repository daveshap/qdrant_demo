Someone please help me
Okay so I’m a 18 year old male. And I’m very confident around females and will talk to one all day long and be very charming and I am not scared to tell some one I want to have sex. I’m very confident around girls who I have little interest in. If I actually have real feelings for a girl I begin to act very insecure and shy. Why is this?
