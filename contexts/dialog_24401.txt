MESSNER: Anything on the Swede?
CARRUTHERS: Only the mention made in that phone call. There's no Swedish hitman of any renown, much less one with a million dollar day rate.
MESSNER: Maybe he's that good. Never been caught, no criminal record.
CARRUTHERS: Maybe.
MESSNER: I tell you, engineering this kind of play against Sparazza, going to the lengths these guys are going to... they're playing some long odds.
CARRUTHERS: And a very bad gamble.
MESSNER: Well... This is as good a place for it as any I guess.
