My UK visit visa has been refused twice. Can I re-apply as the refusal was unsatisfactory? The first refusal (green) was my mistake, as I thought I could show my credit card as well and the employment leave of absence was missing.The second refusal (black), they think that I have unknown credit in my account, whereas the truth is that it was my annual leave payout and I have shown and given the payslip as well. Also, my friend deposited approximately 5,000 AUD, as she wants to sponsor me. I have already repaid her, as it was an issue in the second refusal. Can I re-apply or am I out of options? I wanted to visit my friend. I live  in Australia as a temporary graduate, and I have my sister, brother in law and our home and property.
