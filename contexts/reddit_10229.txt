I told my abusive narcissistic sadist of a mother to “Fuck off, eat the shit that comes out of your mouth & die painfully you sadistic cunt!” Right before cutting contact with her.
My mother has been cruel, verbally, emotionally, psychologically & physically abusive ever since I can remember. For example when I was diagnosed with schizophrenia & severe depression when I was 7, she took a tarantula from outside, threw me in a closet, threw the spider in & locked me in there while screaming like a banshee. That 8 legged monstrosity bit me 5 times before I passed out from fear. When I woke up, there were 4 more bites. She always made me her scapegoat. The first out of my 9 suicide attempts took place when I was 9 years old. When she found out that I started cutting myself, she severely beat me & called me a mistake. Years have passed & after starting to see a psychiatrist, I was diagnosed with severe PTSD & a severe anxiety disorder. I tend to drink to cope with my problems. If anyone were to personally ask me how I would describe myself, I’d say, “Damaged beyond recovery & broken beyond repair.” I barely sleep in fear of yet again reliving my past in my nightmares. I’m 24 now & I’ll be 25 this year. Damn, to those who read this post, I need to know. Was I wrong to tell her off like that?
