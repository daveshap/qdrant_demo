SVEN: Look, I bagged it last week.
ERIK: It doesn't matter WHERE you sit!
SVEN: Yes it does! We could be at sea for months.
ERIK: Well, what difference does it make where you're SITTING?
SVEN: I don't want to have to sit next to Snorri all that time.
SNORRI: Thank you VERY much indeed.
ERIK: Now stop it!
SNORRI: It's SO nice to feel wanted.
ERIK: Leif, you sit there. Even, you sit there. Harald, you'd better sit over there...
SNORRI: Trust me to get the missionary.
ERIK: What are YOU doing here?
SVEN'S DAD: You may need a real Berserk.
SVEN: I AM one, Dad!
ERIK: We haven't got a spare place.
IVAR: He can have my place. I don't want to go anyway.
ERIK: Well, you ARE!
KEITEL: Bjorn's not. He could have Bjorn's place.
ERIK: What's the matter with Bjorn?
THORFINN: Nothing... Halfdan the Black chopped his hand off last night.
ERIK: He was lucky... Sit there.
SNORRI: You can't have Sven's father sitting next to Sven. They'll argue the whole time.
ERIK: That's true. You'd better sit there. You there, and Ornulf there.
SNORRI: Now you've got all the big ones on one side.
