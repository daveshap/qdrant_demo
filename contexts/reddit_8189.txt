What checks exist to prevent a supporter from illegally funding or supporting a candidate, then having the candidate pardon the supporter after a victory?
This question arises from [Trump's recent pardon of Dinesh D'Souza](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-offers-pardon-to-conservative-pundit-dinesh-dsouza-for-campaign-finance-violations/2018/05/31/b4939a08-64d5-11e8-a768-ed043e33f1dc_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.1e83bb4540fc), [who was convicted of having two people illegally donate $10,000 each to a campaign on his behalf.](https://web.archive.org/web/20160517223423/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/24/us/dsouza-is-spared-prison-time-for-campaign-finance-violations.html) In this case, the campaign to which D'Souza donated was a Senate campaign. I'm not sure if each state's gubernatorial elections are entirely state law so as to be pardonable in states where the [ability is granted to the governor, as is granted to the president for federal crimes](https://www.justice.gov/pardon/pardon-information-and-instructions), but what's to stop a newly (re)elected governor or president from pardoning someone who illegally contributed to the campaign, e.g. in the same way D'Souza did?

I believe that when an illegal contribution comes to light during a campaign, [candidates usually return the money](https://www.fec.gov/help-candidates-and-committees/candidate-taking-receipts/questionable-contributions/) or donate to charity, but if a candidate's already been elected--and even returned the money--can they just pardon that supporter?
