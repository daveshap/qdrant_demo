JOE: No.
SALLY: Okay.
JOE: Pretty much a disaster, tonight, wasn't it?
SALLY: I guess.
JOE: Life gets messy. Ugly messy. But I don't understand you. And I don't think I ever understood Lucy. I don't understand throwing it away. How do you throw all that away? Any of it. I want it all. You guys want guarantees? I want the possibilities. And all kinds of crap comes with that. A lot of bad shit. And I think that's okay with me because, because of the rest of the stuff. All the good shit. All the surprises. It's a fucking miracle when you come down to it. We'd have had amazing children, you and me. We'd have had a ride. You'd have surprised yourself. I'll never love anybody else, you know.
SALLY: Me too.
JOE: That's under lock and key.
SALLY: Me too.
JOE: Happy anniversary.
SALLY: It's a Calder.
JOE: I know.
SALLY: He's my favorite.
JOE: I know. It's for the baby's crib.
SALLY: Ah...
SALLY: They're the keys to your grandad's flat. Happy anniversary, baby.
JOE: Oh, Sally Mae...
SALLY: I know.
JOE: Will you make love with me?
SALLY: Sure.
