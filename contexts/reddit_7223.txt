[Serious] Has anyone here ever been hired because of a free online certification?
Hey everyone,

&#x200B;

Currently I am on the hunt for a job that pays better and is a better work environment. What I am looking for is a job in the trades, for instance an electrician, a plumber, an auto mechanic, medical technician, a HVAC, etc. What I am curious to know is if it's actually worth it to study online courses to land a better job. Pretty much any job nowadays, even entry level, will require you to have some form of certification or experience just to get in. How do you break the ice to get into a decent job? I am looking for a higher paying, better quality professional job.

Have any of you tried computer coding and has that worked out for you? Or do you think that there's other careers to consider.

The three fields I'm looking into is:

1. The trades
2. Government
3. Computer technology (very broadly "coding" , other forms of computer level work)

Any thoughts or experiences are welcomed in regards to any success taking free online courses to land into jobs.
