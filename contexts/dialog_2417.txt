LARRY: I hate her. I hate her guts, the bitch.
O'NEILL: Larry, you and your wife got problems?
LARRY: I don't want to talk about it. I love you guys. I love my friends.
LARRY: You want to share it?
RICK: Naw, two on a Quaalude... bad luck.
LARRY: Right.
LARRY: My marriage is the worst. All crap. A big pile of shit.
RICK: Maybe your marriage should lay off grains for a while.
LARRY: She hates me. It's over. You'll see, as soon as you get married, everything changes. You sure you want to go through with it, man?
RICK: What do you mean, it changes?
