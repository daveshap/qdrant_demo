PICARD: Guinan, what's going on? Where am I?
GUINAN: You're in the Nexus.
PICARD: This is the Nexus?
GUINAN: For you. This is where you wanted to be.
PICARD: But I never had a wife, children, a home like this.
GUINAN: Enjoy them, Jean-Luc.
PICARD: Guinan, what are you doing here? I thought you were on the Enterprise.
GUINAN: I am on the Enterprise. I am also here. Think of me as an echo" of the person you know. A part she left behind."
PICARD: Left behind?
GUINAN: When the Enterprise-B beamed us off the Lakul, we were partially in the Nexus. The transporters locked on to us, but somehow everyone left a part of themselves behind.
PICARD: Soran?
GUINAN: All of us.
PICARD: Where is he now?
GUINAN: Wherever he wanted to be.
