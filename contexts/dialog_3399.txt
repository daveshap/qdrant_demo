MAXINE: And the funny thing is. Mr. Malkovich, my voice is probably the least intriguing thing about me.
LOTTE: I've never been looked at like this by a woman.
MALKOVICH: Can I get you a drink?
MAXINE: Whatever you're having.
CRAIG: So how was it? What was he doing?
LOTTE: Oh, you know, not a lot. Just hanging around his apartment. I think he must be a lonely man.
CRAIG: You see, men can feel unfulfilled, too. I'm glad you're realizing that. You shouldn't be so quick to assume that switching bodies would be the answer to all your problems.
LOTTE: You're right. You know I was thinking that we should have Maxine over for dinner. Since you two are partners and all. It might be a nice gesture.
CRAIG: I don't know. There's some tension between us. I'd hate to expose you to that.
LOTTE: It'll be okay. I'll fix my lasagna. Weâ€™ll smoke a joint. Tensions will melt away.
LOTTE: Did you know that Eskimos have not one, but fifty words for snow. It's because they have so much of it.
CRAIG: After dinner I'll show you my puppets.
MAXINE: Ah.
LOTTE: After that I'll introduce you to my favorite monkey, Elijah. He's got an ulcer, due to a suppressed childhood trauma. But we're getting to the bottom of it. Psychotherapy.
