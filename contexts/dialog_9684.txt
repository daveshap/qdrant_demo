ANNE: You can't even give me that?! What were you gonna do, Jack?... Just gonna organize your life... ... walk out that door, move in by yourself and what -- drop the news when you find somebody else? What were you planning to do, Jack?
JACK: I didn't know. I just said all I want is some time.
ANNE: Bullshit! If you're going to hurt me, you hurt me now -- not some long... drawn out hurt that takes weeks of my life because you don't have the balls!
JACK: All right... I'll pack my stuff tonight.
ANNE: What have you been doing here! <u>Huh</u>! <u>I wanna know</u>! <u>What have you been</u> <u>doing here</u>?!
JACK: <u>Listen</u>! We both got something out of it, all right!
ANNE: Oh yeah? What did I get? What did I get I couldn't've gotten from somebody with no name any night of the week? You think your company is such a treat? Your moods, your... pain"
JACK: Then what do you want to stay with me for?
