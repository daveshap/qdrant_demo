RAJA: He doesn't miss a trick, does he?
FURIOUS: What a jerk -- and like nobody knows who he really is!
SHOVELER: Oh don't start that again --
FURIOUS: LOOK!
FURIOUS: He's Lance Hunt! Just take off the glasses -- and it's him!
RAJA: There's a vague similarity.
FURIOUS: A vague similarity? IT'S THE SAME GUY!
SHOVELER: Oh, who gives a damn who he is? I can't take this anymore. Night after night we're on the streets, busting our humps -- and for what?
RAJA: We take the licks and he gets the chicks.
SHOVELER: How long do you have to chase a dream before you realize it's not gonna happen?
FURIOUS: We need a break, that's all! Nobody'd ever heard of him until he busted Casanova Frankenstein!
RAJA: But look at him... and look at us.
