MRS. ROBINSON: Thank you.
BEN: Right.
MRS. ROBINSON: What are you so scared of?
BEN: I'm not scared, Mrs. Robinson.
MRS. ROBINSON: Then why do you keep running away?
BEN: Because you're going to bed. I don't think I should be up here.
MRS. ROBINSON: Haven't you ever seen anybody in a slip before?
BEN: Yes, I have --
BEN: But I just -- Look -- what if Mr. Robinson walked in right now?
MRS. ROBINSON: What if he did?
BEN: Well, it would look pretty funny, wouldn't it?
MRS. ROBINSON: Don't you think he trusts us together?
BEN: Of course he does. But he might get the wrong idea. Anyone might.
MRS. ROBINSON: I don't see why. I'm twice as old as you are. How could anyone think --
BEN: But they would! Don't you see?
MRS. ROBINSON: Benjamin -- I'm not trying to seduce you. I wish you'd --
BEN: I know that. But please, Mrs. Robinson. This is difficult for me.
MRS. ROBINSON: Why is it?
BEN: Because I am confused about things. I can't tell what I'm imagining. I can't tell what's real. I can't --
MRS. ROBINSON: Would you like me to seduce you?
BEN: What?
MRS. ROBINSON: Is that what you're trying to tell me?
BEN: I'm going home now. I apologize for what I said. I hope you can forget it. But I'm going home right now.
MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE: BENJAMIN?
BEN: Yes.
MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE: Will you bring up my purse before you go?
BEN: I have to go now. I'm sorry.
MRS. ROBINSON: I really don't want to put this on again. Won't you bring it up?
BEN: Where is it?
MRS. ROBINSON: On that chair in the hall.
BEN: Mrs. Robinson?
MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE: I'm in the bathroom.
BEN: Well here's the purse.
MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE: Could you bring it up?
BEN: Well I'll hand it to you.
BEN: Come to the railing and I'll hand it up.
MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE: Benjamin -- I am getting pretty tired of all this suspicion. Now if you won't do me a simple favor I don't know what.
BEN: I'm putting it on the top step.
MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE: For God's sake, Benjamin, will you stop acting that way and bring me the purse?
BEN: I'm putting it here by the door.
MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE: Will you bring it in to me?
BEN: I'd rather not.
MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE: All right. Put it in the room where we were.
BEN: Right.
