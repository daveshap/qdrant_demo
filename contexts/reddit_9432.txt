I'd like to thank you guys.
Within a year I went from making 30k to 70k then losing that new job. I was pretty distraught, I have nothing besides a highschool degree and only got that job by putting nearly a decade into that company. I was panicking and came to you guys asking if I should cash in my 401k, borrow money to cover debts ect. Through advice and lurking I was convinced to stay the course and not do anything drastic. I worked as a temp at a factory and cut cost for 3 months until I was able to get my job back through arbitration. 

Things are better but now I save literally half of my income and I'm actively looking for something else. (I anticipate that HR wont take this lying down.) it was a rude awakening to realize I'm one bad break away from having to start all over again. My goal now is to never feel this sense of helplessness or dependence again. 

Anyway, you guys are a great resource and much more pragmatic than others subs Ive seen. Thanks for being here.
