FRANK: It's been bad lately, but it's always bad.
MARY: How long you been doing this?
FRANK: Five years.
MARY: Wow, you musta seen some things, huh? What's the worst thing you ever seen?
FRANK: You learn to sort of block it out, you know, like cops fence off a crime scene. But then something good will happen and everything will just glow.
MARY: You must get a lot of overdoses. I bet you picked me up a couple of times.
FRANK: I think I'd remember that.
MARY: Maybe not. I was a different person then. Does everybody you meet spill their problems on you like this?
FRANK: Mostly. It must be my face. My mother always said I looked like a priest.
MARY: I better go check on my father. Thanks for the pizza. I owe you one. Maybe when he gets better, you know, when we're done with all this.
FRANK: Sure.
