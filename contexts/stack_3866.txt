Why are effect size estimates difficult in mixed-effects models? I have been reading a lot online about estimating standardised effect sizes in mixed effects models and it seems like there are formidable challenges even for something relatively broad like an R^2, let alone for contrasts. What is a simple explanation (that I could supply to a reviewer) for why effects sizes are so challenging to perform in these more complex models?
