Chi-square or binomial logistic regression? I am unsure about which statistical test suits my needs, in particular I wonder whether chi-square should be used or not. The responses I get from my experiments are not continuous, but discrete, specifically taking the values of 0 or 1. I need to compare 3 groups. Here the details:I performed 3 experiments, each experiment tested a different system, and each experiment involved a distinct group of subjects. In total there where 25 participants (7 for the first system, 7 for the second, 11 for the third). Subjects were asked to identify a stimulus (i.e. a vibration provided by a haptic device).Recognition was measured as 1 = correct identification, 0 = incorrect identification. Stimuli where repeated, each stimulus receive 0 or 1 as measurement of participants' responses to it.The stimuli where different for each system. Still I want to test whether participants using one system performed better than the participants using other systems.My goal is only to assess the statistical differences between the 3 groups.Based on my understanding, an alternative to chi-square could also be a binomial logistic regression, but I am unsure. If chi-square is the right way to go, can I compare 3 groups using 3 separate tests (A vs B, B vs C, A vs C) without affecting the alpha? If I have to correct it, what is the right value for 3 groups?Can anyone please suggest the right function to be used in R?
