How to assess the effect of an intervention when having a control sample is unethical? I'd like to assess the effect of a medication X on some scalar, nominal and ordinal parameters of disease Y.Problem is, this medication X has proven to greatly reduce mortality in patients with disease Y, so depriving patients from this drug is a no-go. There is no other drug for this disease.The way our data collection system is set up, I have data on those parameters at baseline, that is when patients are diagnosed with disease Y and start taking drug X. I can also measure these parameters at any point while they take this medication. I'm currently thinking of running a paired t-test for the scalar and ordinal variables and chi-squared tests for the nominal variables. So, I'd like to ask; are there more powerful statistical tests for these hypotheses? is there a better way to set up such an experiment?I'm really grateful for your insights in advance!
