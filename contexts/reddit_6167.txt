I completed on-boarding, but cannot get in contact with anyone about a start date?
Hi everyone. I accepted a healthcare position at a temporary site for the pandemic. I have completed and passed all CORIs, completed all onboarding modules through the overarching company/hospital, been given login information for their systems, and even have access to view and add myself to the schedule. However, I have attempted to contact two different individuals in HR who have been sending emails throughout the hiring process, and no one has answered.   

I replied to person 1's email last thursday looking for clarifications and with questions. No answer. 

I replied to person 2's email on Monday immediately after they sent it as it mentioned information about other people having already completed orientation, looking for clarifications and information about starting. No answer.    

I called person 2 on Tuesday and left a voicemail explaining I have completed hiring paperwork and was looking to speak to someone about next steps. No answer.   

On Wednesday I sent a direct email to person 1 as opposed to replying to a thread. No answer.   

I understand it might look like I am being a pain in the rear end, but if this was for a regular job and not a pandemic position that Ive already been clearly hired for and have access to everything, Id patiently wait. But the fact I have access to the schedule (which says do not put yourself on until you've oriented), I have no idea what to do.   

Im going to just wait it out now, but does that seem like the right move? Do I try calling again?
