How does DNS over TLS prevent your ISP from seeing the websites you visit? For example, I'm using DNS over TLS in Android Pie. This happens:I visit a website (google.com).I send a DNS query to the DNS server, and the response is the IP address of google.com. The ISP knows I contacted the DNS server, but doesn't know the query or the response.Next, I connect to the IP of google.com. The ISP knows I contacted google.com's IP now.And yet, news articles (and some questions in this site) says that the ISP won't see the websites you visit if you use DNS over TLS. Am I missing something here?
