What do you call this concern?  \"Scholarly accuracy?\"Example sentence for an email to Collaborator A:<blockquote>  Well, when putting together quotes from published material, there will be quotation marks and attributions to sources.  If an error is detected in the original material, clarifying text can be inserted in brackets.  (Example 1, Example 2.)  Thus, it is possible to make corrections and still avoid lapses in scholarly accuracy.</blockquote>Is the part in bold a correct description of the concern, and if not, what is this called?
