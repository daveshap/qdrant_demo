HANNA: You must leave. You were not here this morning.
CLAY: But I didn't do this!
HANNA: The police will not know that. They will want to investigate.
CLAY: We have his note.
HANNA: Do you want to be questioned about you and Mr. Jimmy? Please, Clayton. It will be better if I find the body alone.
CLAY: But how're you going to explain this? How did you get him out of the pool?
HANNA: You are right. Yes. We must put him back.
