FOX: You're home late... or should I say early?
JEN: Why are you still here? You killed a policeman. You should leave! You'll bring ruin on my whole family.
FOX: They wouldn't have found me if you hadn't stolen the sword. Like a little girl, you thought stealing would be fun? You, too, are responsible for that death. Come with me. You don't want to waste your life as the wife of some bureaucrat. Denied your talent... As a master and disciple we will rule.
JEN: I'll never live as a thief!
FOX: You're already a thief.
JEN: That was just for fun. How can I leave? Where would I go?
FOX: Wherever we want. We'll get rid of anyone in our way. Even your father.
JEN: Shut up!
FOX: It's the Giang Hu fighter lifestyle... kill or be killed. Exciting, isn't it?
JEN: I owe you nothing.
FOX: Yes, you do! You are still my disciple.
JEN: You think you've been teaching me all these years from the manual? You couldn't even decipher the symbols!
FOX: I studied the diagrams. But you hid the details!
JEN: You wouldn't have understood, even if I had tried to explain. You know... you've gone as far as you can go. I hid my skills so as not to hurt you.
FOX: If I hadn't seen you fight with Li Mu Bai, I'd still be ignorant of all you've hidden from me.
JEN: Master... I started learning from you in secret when I was 10. You enchanted me with the world of Giang Hu. But once I realized I could surpass you, I became so frightened! Everything fell apart. I had no one to guide me, no one to learn from.
FOX: Believe me, I've a lesson or two left to teach you!
