Trouble running program after successful install New overwhelmed ubuntu user here, but so happy to be finally doing this. I have learned so much so far. I just installed a package for a program called virtual moon atlas 6.0. It consists of three .tgz files; One for 386 processor, one for x86, and one for the data, and a .sh file. I ran the .sh file. It installed, and the script ended with a output line saying that said in order to run the program run this following command. export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/virtual_moon/lib &amp;&amp; ~/virtual_moon/bin/atlunWhen I run this it says /home/josh/virtual_moon/bin/atlun: No such file or directoryThinking I was some sort of genius and I decided to the run the following line of code with two vertical bars instead of two ampersands for basically no good reason.export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/virtual_moon/lib || ~/virtual_moon/bin/atlunIt ran without an error code, but I don't think it matters because I can't figure out how to launch the program or even find the program name to launch it from the command line by using the find command.What should I do? Thanks for any help you offer. I am so happy to join this community finally.
