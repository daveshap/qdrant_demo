LAMBEAU: What do you mean he didn't talk?" You sat there for an hour?"
SEAN: No, he just sat there and counted the seconds until the session was over. It was pretty impressive, actually.
LAMBEAU: Why would he do that?
SEAN: To show me he doesn't have to talk to me if he doesn't want to.
LAMBEAU: Oh, what is this? Some kind of staring contest between two kids from the old neighborhood?""
SEAN: I won't talk first.
