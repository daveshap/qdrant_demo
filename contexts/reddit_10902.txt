My dog stopped me
I changed all my emergency contact info from my parents to someone else months ago. This way my school and local police department would never know who my guardians were. Today has been the hardest day in the past few months. A situation that happened to me when I was 15 happened to me again today. I already have really bad ptsd. So today made it worse. 

I cut myself for the first time in a long time. But I did it vertically this time. I tried to kill myself but my dog came up next to me and tried to lick my hands. I love him more than anything. I want him to never experience pain or sadness. I want my dog to have the best life fucking possible. He’s the only reason I didn’t kill myself tonight.
