What do you do when no where will hire you?
I have zero experience as I just graduated high school and the only places near me hiring are fast food joints and my attempts have failed. What do you do when even the most basic place won’t hire you? I’m looking after my sick parents and grandparents as well as pets/housework so I don’t have much time to be volunteering for experience. Plus they’re starting to pressure me to bring in money for them. Any advice?
