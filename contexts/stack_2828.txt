Can someone please explain the concept 'B' regarding magnetic fields? I can't seem to understand the concept 'B'.I have done a great deal of research regarding magnetism and magnetic fields but I seem to have just complicated the matter further.What I understand so far is that magnetic fields are produced by moving charges &amp; that the magnetic field is a vector field. I understand that a compass can give us the direction of a magnetic field at any point.Now my problem arises. I know that B is called the magnetic field and, from the Lorentz force law, B is the force applied to a moving unit charge in the unit Tesla. However, isn't B also regarded as the magnetic flux density (the amount of flux per unit area)? If this is so, then how can B represent both the magnetic field and the magnetic flux density? Is the magnitude of the magnetic field and magnetic flux density the same thing?Sorry for the length of this, thanks in advance.
