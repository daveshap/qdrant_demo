I am writing some short stories and can't wrap my head around a time travel paradox I put an object in a time-travel device (say something that looks like a microwave ). I am now going to transport the object in time, but leave it in the same position relative to the Earth.If it was into the future, that's fine. It could simply disappear and re-appear in 5 mins, BUT, if I transport it into the past, then of course it would have already been in the device when I attempted to put it in... How the heck can I get around this?
