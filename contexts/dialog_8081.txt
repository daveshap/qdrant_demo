CARR: Treves. Well done.
TREVES: Not me, sir. Mr. Merrick. He succeeded in spite of my shortsightedness.
TREVES: Why did you let me go on like that, teaching you what you already knew? Why didn't you tell me you could read?
MERRICK: You did not ask me.
TREVES: I never thought to ask. How can you ever forgive me?
MERRICK: Oh, no do not say that. You have been so kind to me. I was afraid to say too much. People always want me to be quiet. You wanted me to speak, but I was afraid. Forgive me.
TREVES: We do have a lot to talk about, don't we?
CARR: Can you imagine what his life has been like?
TREVES: Yes, I think I can.
CARR: No you can't. You can't begin to know, no one can.
CARR: You are quite right, Treves, this is an exceptional case. And I quite agree that the committee should see Mr. Merrick.
TREVES: I could easily arrange...
CARR: No, not that way. Broadneck and the others don't like to deal with patients directly. It makes them queasy... Do you have any photographs of Mr. Merrick?
TREVES: Well, yes.
CARR: Excellent. We shall present them, along with the other particulars of the case to the committee. I want them to see, exactly, how horribly his body has been affected. You and I shall vouch for his inner qualities.
TREVES: Do you think they'll go along with us?
CARR: Of course they will. They're reasonable men.
