Got a second paycheck after being fired
So I got fired from Papa Murphy's over 2 weeks ago now. I won't get into the details but the following day I got what I believed to be my final paycheck and everyone who I talked to about it said it would be my final. Now we got paid every other Tuesday. I decided to check my balance just now because I am waiting on a refund and I see 96$ when I only had 10$ last night. Is this a mistake? And if it is should I take it out before they take it back?
