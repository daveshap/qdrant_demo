My Twin Sister Wants To Take My Life Away From Me Including My Dream
I have a dream that one day i'll get married with a man that will appreciate me for who I am and what I'll be thinking; and accept me for who I am. 

Anyways, My twin sister thinks I'm lesbian, gay would do bad, etc. 

She wants to put me away because she thinks I'm not fit for my own well-being for acting like a child. When I don't know how to handle pain, and don't like it when people are controlling towards me. I'm afraid of my sister trying to control my life and how I should act. She wants to get rid of me. Because She thinks I'm a weird crazy person. Yet I have Autism and I have depression and bipolar.

I'm depressed because of my twin sister always wanting to get rid of me because she don't like how calm and normal I am for being a person. 

I want to be accepted for who I am.

I dream about love and my family thinks its not normal for me to come out clean and say, ''I want my fairytale dream to come true'' But my sister wants to take away my dream, my life, my stuff, and put me away, before I know it I could be thrown to hell. x.x
