CLARENCE: And here we are.

CLARENCE: You goin' out?
DICK: Well, for the past couple of years I've been goin' out with girls from my acting class.
CLARENCE: Good for you.
DICK: What's so fuckin' good about it? Actresses are the most fucked-in-the-head bunch of women in the world. It's like they gotta pass a test of emotional instability before they can get their SAG card. Oh, guess what? I had a really good reading for T.J. Hooker" the other day."

CLARENCE: Every word of it.
DICK: You're really in love, aren't you?
CLARENCE: For the very first time in my life. Do you know what that's like?
