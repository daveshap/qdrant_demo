ELIZABETH: So I hear you have a girlfriend.
DONNIE: Yeah.
ELIZABETH: What's her name?
DONNIE: You're not gonna tell Mom, are you?
ELIZABETH: Why would I tell Mom?
DONNIE: Because you tell Mom everything.
ELIZABETH: No I don't. She worries about you.
DONNIE: Well, don't worry... I'm taking my medication.
ELIZABETH: It's not that. I mean mouthing off to your teachers. I'll admit... when Dad told me what you said to Ms. Farmer, I laughed my ass off.
DONNIE: I was just being honest.
ELIZABETH: Yeah... well, that's not the way the world works. If you keep being too honest, the world will eventually find a way to destroy you.
DONNIE: Her name is Gretchen.
ELIZABETH: That's a nice name. OK, let me see it.
ROSE: Thank you for seeing us... We... just felt that it was time to discuss...
DR. THURMAN: What I think is going on with your son.
ROSE: Well, you know about his past. And when you said to look for signs of aggression... He was recently suspended from school for insulting his gym teacher.
