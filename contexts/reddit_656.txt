How do I uninvite my friend from something she’s already invited to?
So I (19F) have a friend (19F) who I’ve been friend with for over 7 years. We used to be best friends but recently things are gone SUPER downhill. At this point, she is just intolerable to be around. She’s an alcoholic, a compulsive liar, manipulative, depressed and more. I’m not saying this to be mean, it’s 100% true. I have tried getting her help NUMEROUS times, but she refuses every time. 
We have made a bunch of plans for the future, I still want to go to all the plans with my friends, just not with her. Her coming literally makes doing anything unenjoyable. 
She is friends with all my friends (all 19F) ... but my friends are done with her too. We feel bad basically. We don’t want to really be her friend anymore but we feel like we can’t completely ditch her because of her problems. 

Things I need her uninvited from:
- concerts 
- a vacation 
- clubs

Please help!! Any idea is a good idea at this point.
