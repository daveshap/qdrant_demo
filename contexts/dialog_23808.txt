JACK: A bad girl, Miles. She might need to be spanked.
MILES: Do you know how often these pourers get hit on?
JACK: Get the trunk.
MILES: You have the keys.
JACK: We're on.
MILES: What?
JACK: She called Maya, who's not working tonight, so we're all going out.
MILES: With Maya?
JACK: Been divorced for a year now, bud.
JACK: Stephanie, holy shit. Chick had it all going on.
MILES: Well, she is cute.
JACK: Cute? She's a fucking hottie. And you almost tell her I'm getting married. What's the matter with you? Gotta love it. Gotta love it.
JACK: You know how often these pourers get hit on? I'm going for a swim. Get the blood flowing. Want to come?
MILES: Nah. I want to watch this.
