MISS WOLLSTEN: I wish I didn't have such bitter knowledge of you, Cathy.
CATHY: Whet do you mean?
MISS WOLLSTEN: They were talking about the Vrykolakas this morning. Cathy, that's what you are —— a weak, pale, half-dead thing that drains all the life and joy from those who want to live.
CATHY: Miss Wollsten!
MISS WOLLSTEN: You and your mysterious illness. A new attack everytime you are crossed — everytime you can't get your own way.
MISS WOLLSTEN: Your father knew it too. But he was never sure how much was pretense.
CATHY: How do you know what my father thought - -
MISS WOLLSTEN: Your father loved me. He wanted to marry me. But he was afraid of hurting the gentle, delicate Cathy. You spoiled his life ——you've ruined mine ——
CATHY: You were father's secretary -— I never thought - -
MISS WOLLSTEN: Didn't you? But now -- what are you thinking now?
CATHY: What would I be thinking?
MISS WOLLSTEN: Mr. Davis seems a good prospect ——young handsome, sympathetic -- ready to listen to you and feel sorry for you - -
CATHY: What if he is?
MISS WOLLSTEN: ) But Thea -- She stands in your way. I know you. I know your little hints —— the way you can turn the truth into a lie --
CATHY: Why, I'm fond of Thea.
MISS WOLLSTEN: You're planing something, Cathy.. But I won't let you —- I'll warn them against you.
CATHY: You will not say one single word. I know your secret.
MISS WOLLSTEN: That your father and I ——
CATHY: No. I mean your other secret -—	the one you kept bidden even from my father. That old doctor in London -- he told me.
