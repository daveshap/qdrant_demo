What happens to the chlorine in epichlorohydrin when a two-part epoxy is air-cured? Where does the chlorine go? Does it evaporate as a by-product or does it remain in the epoxy? I'm using a two-part resin and hardener and curing them at room temp. The resin is bisphenol-A-epichlorohydrin, and I believe the final cured epoxy does not have chlorine as a part of its main structure. I need to know the whereabouts of Cl because I'm trying to study neutron interaction with materials in my detector, and I suspect there's some chlorine in there but not sure entirely.
