How to trigger spinning wheel diagnostics report I'm working on application that consume significant CPU time and memory under heavy load. my setup configuration is fusion VM that runs macOS Sierra 10.12.6. At some stage I get spinning wheel and the entire VM hangs. Unfortunately I couldn't find any valuable log after rebooting the machine. perhaps there's a way to enforce taking performance diagnostics report so that I could properly analyze what cause the hanging ? thanks
