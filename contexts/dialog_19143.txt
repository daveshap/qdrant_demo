TRIPLETTE: Well, that's not entirely true, Barnett. At least not according to Haven.
BARNETT: Haven? Hell,' we've been playing poker together since we were fourteen.
TRIPLETTE: I guess that's why he thought you right want to help out.
BARNETT: He knows better.
TRIPLETTE: Well, it's probably because it would help him.
BARNETT: How is that?
TRIPLETTE: Everybody likes to be as good as their word.
BARNETT: Whose word?
TRIPLETTE: His Word.
BARNETT: His word? Are you telling me Haven promised you something?
TRIPLETTE: That's pretty close. He's going to be on the bill. Why not put Barbara Jean on with him?
