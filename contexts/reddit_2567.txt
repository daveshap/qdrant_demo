How did you guys find your career?
I'm almost 30 years old and I still don't have a career. Sure I have a lot of work experience but ive never really truly been able to find my career. I only stayed at jobs for 1-2 year's before moving on. I've got a BA in Public administration and criminal justice and been out of school for 3 years. The current job I'm at now has a lot of room for growth but it's not something I want to make a career out of. I'm just not sure how I'd be able to find my career. How do you know what you're doing now is what you want to do for the rest of your life?
