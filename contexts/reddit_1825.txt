@rising seniors, I CANNOT BELIEVE WE'RE STARTING THE COLLEGE APPLICATION PROCESS!!
My school has just asked us to get our recommendation letters together and every time I try to start writing the emails my brain just explodes. I can't lie I've had like 8 existential crises since the morning.

How are you guys feeling right now?
