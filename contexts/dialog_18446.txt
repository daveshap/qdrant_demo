COBB: Have a drink?
LONGFELLOW: No, thanks.
CEDAR: Will you have a cigar?
LONGFELLOW: No, thank you.
CEDAR: I wouldn't worry if I were you. Of course, a large fortune like this entails a great responsibility - but you'll have a good deal of help. So don't worry. Leave everything to me.
LONGFELLOW: Oh, I wasn't worried about that.
CEDAR: No?
LONGFELLOW: I was wondering where they're going to get another tuba player for the band.
