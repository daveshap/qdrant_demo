Am I crazy to quit a job with a good title to go to something 'lesser' because of stress?
I've been working as a pension fund administrator for the last 15 months now. Without too many details, ah this has been a very painful experience for me.I've been on contract this entire time, meaning I've had no vacation time sick days health insurance and my pay is very low I'm living paycheck-to-paycheck

However, my job title is quite impressive in the context of my career development over the last decade.

But I simply can't take this anymore. The stress is taking over my life, I've been having nightmares recently about my work. I'm not able to save any money at all... This job is good for my career but bad for my life.

I know I need to find new employment, but to find something that would take advantage of this experience would probably take a while. And I don't have a while, I can't wait anymore I feel like I'm on the edge of something bad if I keep trying to put up with my current situation.

My question is, would I be crazy to quit and take a job that doesn't take advantage of this recent experience? 

To be specific, I know I can get a job working as a front desk attendant at a hotel. It would be much less stressful, I would be full-time so I would have a decent pay, health insurance, vacation time, etc.

But would this derail my career? If I did want to come back to the pensions industry with this sort of be a black mark for me? should I just suck it up and try to deal with my current situation for the next few months until I can find a role that would be in a related industry and that at least would be a lateral move??

Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated, thanks everyone
