TRINITY: Hello, Neo.
NEO: How do you know that name?
TRINITY: I know a lot about you. I've been wanting to meet you for some time.
NEO: Who are you?
TRINITY: My name is Trinity.
NEO: Trinity? The Trinity? The Trinity that cracked the I.R.S. Kansas City D-Base?
TRINITY: That was a long time ago.
NEO: Gee-zus.
TRINITY: What?
NEO: I just thought... you were a guy.
TRINITY: Most guys do.
NEO: Do you want to go somewhere and talk?
TRINITY: No. It's safe here and I don't have much time.
