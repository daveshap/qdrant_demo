JILL: What are you doing in Information Retrieval?
SAM: Looking for you.
JILL: No, really.
SAM: Really.
JILL: I mean, it doesn't suit you.
SAM: Suit me?
JILL: Don't you know the sort of thing that Information Retrieval does?
SAM: What do you mean? Would you rather have terrorists?
JILL: We've got both.
SAM: Things would be worse without Information Retrieval.
JILL: They couldn't be worse for the Buttles.
JILL: Why don't you say, no system is perfect.
SAM: Well, no system is.
JILL: Say, all wars have innocent victims.
SAM: Well, all wars do -
JILL: Who is this war against, Sam?
SAM: Well, terrorists of course.
JILL: How many terrorists have you met? Actual terrorists?
SAM: Actual. terrorists? Well ... it's only my first day.
JILL: Look at that - right on time.
SAM: What? I thought you were free to come and go as you please.
JILL: Well, almost ... unfortunately I do have to punch in by 5.00 every day.
SAM: Every day?
SAM: Turn around!
JILL: What?
SAM: They'll be there waiting.
JILL: Who will?
SAM: Security.
JILL: You're joking.
SAM: No. Please. They're going to arrest you.
JILL: I thought you arrested me.
SAM: Yes ... but, this is real. Now, stop!
JILL: Cut it out, Sam.
SAM: Will you please turn back.
JILL: Get away!
SAM: Turn!
JILL: Stop it ... damn you!
