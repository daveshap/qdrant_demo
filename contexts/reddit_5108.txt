Rejected from dream job -_- My rejection rate is in the triple digits. How am I suppose to keep going when I am falling further into a depression? How did you find the motivation to keep going?
Feeling exhausted and emotionally depleted. I am trying everything I can to get an offer and have made it to 3 final rounds with rejections. Applied to 300+ jobs. My bills are adding up and I've never felt like a bigger loser. I'm tired of hoping that someday some job will magically want me. This process is so freaking demoralizing. How the heck do you not give up?

Even worse my dream job replied with this: 

"Unfortunately, we have hired another candidate for the position that had more applicable experience to the role.  That being said, I do think you have a lot of awesome strengths and qualities.  I plan to keep you in mind for future opportunities and would like to reach out to you when something else comes open.  I think you would be a great fit with the \*\*\* culture and hope that we can bring you on board at some point in the future."
