What Does the Typical Day in The Life of a Business Analyst Look Like?
I'm just curious as to what a typical day looks like for a business analyst. I've had four years lower level management experience and one year upper level as an operations manager. I will be completing my degree in Business Analytics in 3 months. 

I already know what they do generally (according to college which isn't always reality), but I'm looking for more meat and potatoes type stuff and a typical day on the job. 

Thanks!
