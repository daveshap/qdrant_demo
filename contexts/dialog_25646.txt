STAR MAN: The cowboys were right. You can make money fast gambling.
JENNY: You don't make money gambling. You lose it.
JENNY: Do you have a good map of Death Valley?
CLERK: We should have. Let me see.
STAR MAN: May I have twenty-five cents, please?
JENNY: What for?
STAR MAN: I want to gamble.
JENNY: Here are two quarters. When you lose these, you're not going to get anymore.
STAR MAN: I understand. Thank you.
JENNY: This is crazy. We don't have time for this.
STAR MAN: I know how to gamble now.
JENNY: You won ten dollars. Big deal. If we don't get a good ride before dark we could miss your ship.
STAR MAN: I want to get money for you and the baby.
JENNY: I don't need any money for the baby. I'll be fine.
STAR MAN: Inflation, tuition, college. Children are damned expensive. I know.
JENNY: The cook again?
STAR MAN: Yes.
JENNY: If I ever run into that guy, I'm going to kick his ass.
JENNY: It'll tell you pretty much everything about us...
STAR MAN: This is very interesting. We are born knowing our history. We have other books. But not a book like this.
JENNY: Any words you don't know you can find in the dictionary.
STAR MAN: I understand.
JENNY: It'll give you the different countries, how they came to be, what they are now, how America came to be, the governments, the languages... everything.
STAR MAN: Many of my people will not believe those things are possible. On my planet there is only one government, one people, one language. I will be asked a lot of questions.
JENNY: What will you say about us?
STAR MAN: I will say that we can be friends.
JENNY: We can.
JENNY: This is yours...
STAR MAN: If you want to keep it, you can.
JENNY: I'd like to...
JENNY: Would you put some of your singing in this for the baby?
STAR MAN: You want the baby to laugh at me.
JENNY: Yes.
JENNY: How long will it take you to get home?
STAR MAN: Many, many days and nights...
