LEE: What's going on?
ISABELLA: I need your help.
LEE: Last time you needed my help I ended up in the back of a truck.
ISABELLA: I'm undercover. I had no choice. You have to trust me.
ISABELLA: You move well.
LEE: Just trying to make it look real.
ISABELLA: Look over there. That's the eye in the sky room.
ISABELLA: Behind me is the soft count room. We're pretty sure the plates are back there.
LEE: Why don't you go get them?
ISABELLA: If I'm wrong then my cover is blown.
CARTER: Stevie, how's it going my man? Somebody get a picture, we can use it for a mug shot.
STEVEN REIGN: Detective Carter, you always seem to show up where you don't belong.
CARTER: Lemme ask you something, Steven. And I want the truth. Is there any way I can date your daughter? Just dinner and a movie, maybe go listen to some jazz...
STEVEN REIGN: Vegas has been my town for 30 years. I crawled out from under the first rock. Do you really think you can intimidate me here?
CARTER: You're right, you're a smart guy. Most counterfeiters only get ten cents on the dollar. But this is an even swap. Pure genius.
STEVEN REIGN: You play games with me, Detective, and you'll lose every time. Don't forget. The odds are always in favor of the house.
ISABELLA: The Secret Service almost busted Reign at his casino in Macao, but the place burned down before we could move in.
LEE: How do I know I can trust you?
ISABELLA: Dip me!
ISABELLA: I'm asking for real now -- will you help the Secret Service?
LEE: No. But I'll help you.
CARTER: Lee, what the hell are you doing?
LEE: Dancing?
CARTER: Dancing? I'm out here trying to strong arm Steven Reign, putting my life on the line, and you're up here dancing with some bimbo. Did she have a friend?
LEE: It was Isabella. She says the plates are in the soft count room.
CARTER: Isabella? Are you crazy, man? She almost got us killed. She's setting you up again!
LEE: No. I'm going to find out.
CARTER: Wait a second. There's guards all over the place. You'll need a distraction.
CARTER: I'll go to the craps table, make a big scene. When security comes over, you make your move.
LEE: Try to keep them busy for five minutes.
CARTER: I'll give it my best shot.
