JANINE: And someone from the EPA is here to see you.
VENKMAN: The EPA? What's he want?
JANINE: I didn't ask him. All I know is that I haven't had a break in two weeks and you promised you'd hire more help.
VENKMAN: Janine, I'm sure a woman with your qualifications would have no trouble finding a top flight job in the housekeeping or food service industry.
JANINE: Oh, really? Well, I've quit better jobs than this one, believe me.
STANTZ: Very impressive resume. Electronic countermeasures, Strategic Air Command ... Black belt in Karate ... Small arms expert ... Mr. Zeddemore, as you may have heard, we locate ghosts and spirits, trap them with streams of concentrated quantum energy and remove them from people's homes, offices and places of worship.
WINSTON: Yeah, I heard that. Now tell me what you really do.
VENKMAN: Can I help you?
PECK: I'm Walter Peck. I represent the Environmental Protection Agency, Third District.
VENKMAN: Great! How's it going?
PECK: Are you Peter Venkman?
VENKMAN: Yes, I'm Doctor Venkman.
PECK: Exactly what are you a doctor of, Mr. Venkman?
VENKMAN: I have Ph.D's in psychology and parapsychology.
PECK: I see. And now you catch ghosts?
VENKMAN: You could say that.
PECK: And how many ghosts have you caught, Mr. Venkman?
VENKMAN: I'm not at liberty to say.
PECK: And where do you put these ghosts once you catch them?
VENKMAN: In a storage facility.
PECK: And would this storage facility be located on these premises?
VENKMAN: Yes, it would.
PECK: And may I see this storage facility?
VENKMAN: No, you may not.
PECK: And why not, Mr. Venkman?
VENKMAN: Because you didn't say the magic word.
PECK: And what is the magic word, Mr. Venkman?
VENKMAN: The magic word is please.""
PECK: May I please see the storage facility?
VENKMAN: Why do you want to see it?
PECK: Well, because I'm curious. I want to know more about what you do here. Frankly, there have been a lot of wild stories in the media and we want to assess any possible environmental impact from your operation. For instance, the storage of noxious, possibly hazardous waste materials in your basement. Now either you show me what's down there or I come back with a court order.
VENKMAN: Go ahead! Get a court order. Then I'm gonna sue your ass off for wrongful prosecution.
PECK: Have it your way, Mr. Venkman.
VENKMAN: Hey! Make yourself useful! Go save a tree!
STANTZ: Set entry grid.
SPENGLER: Neutronize. System shut.
SPENGLER: I've got to sleep.
STANTZ: I need two new purge valves. How's the grid around the storage facility holding up?
SPENGLER: I'm worried, Ray. It's getting crowded in there. And all my recent data points to something big on the bottom.
