At what point will being older affect chances of getting a job?
Hi everyone,

I got off to a late start in my schooling. I have a 2-year diploma in Social Service work and will likely be 31 years old when I obtain my Bachelors degree. I may also go for a Masters, which would make me even older.

I have heard that it can be harder to find jobs when you are older and I worry about job prospects when I do start applying for jobs in the field. 

I'd like to work with marginalized populations in some capacity. I'm especially passionate about mental health and poverty. Would being in my early-mid 30's be off-putting for employers?
