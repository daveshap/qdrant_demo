PETER: It's a good play, but risky.
JEREMY: You don't win by playing it safe, Peter.
PETER: What are you doing up?
ERICA: I can't sleep. My beds lumpy.
PETER: I see. You forgot to bring you're night-light, didn't you?
ERICA: That has nothing to do with it.
PETER: You want to sleep in my bed tonight?
ERICA: Okay.
