Driver install fails on Epson Xp-620 I recently installed Ubuntu 16.04 LTS on both of my laptops - a 6 yr old Acer and an 18 mo old Dell Inspiron 15 5000 series. I did the Acer first and the 'add printer' handily found and configured my Epson XP-620 printer. Test page looked good!After the Dell machine was configured with the same Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (both derived from the same bootable stick) I tried to add the same Epson printer. During the 'espcr' driver install the progress bar permanently froze after some 20 seconds. I've tried it several times trying both the DNS and pass thru options. Neither does the trick. I also notice that in the list of printer makes and models the Epson XP-620 is missing. That didn't seem to matter with the success on the Acer. There seems to be no communication problem, evidenced by the fact that if I choose another Epson model the printer simply shoots blanks.What can I do?
