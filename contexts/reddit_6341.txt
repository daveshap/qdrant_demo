Hi Reddit, I am the owner of Executive Drafts, a career services center that helps people get hired. AMA about interviews, job-hunting, resumes, etc!
We started out writing great resumes and cover letters, but have quickly evolved into interview coaching, salary negotiation, and job-hunting skills.  Our goal is to open a career center here in Austin, TX where applicants can work 1x1 with us to practice interviewing, approaching recruiters, building networks on LinkedIn, and more.  

I'll be answering any and all questions this weekend about job hunting, interviews, or anything else relevant to taking that next step in your career.  And if you want to learn more about us, please visit us at www.ExecutiveDrafts.com!

Edit: I'm also giving all redditors 15% off any of my services (Code: REDDIT15), so if you want someone to work with you to build the resume and cover letter from the ground up, or if you need help getting through interviews and salary negotiation, we've got you covered!
