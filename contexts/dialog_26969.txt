CHRISTINE: Want anything to drink?
NICHOLAS: You?
CHRISTINE: Yeah. First Communion. Aren't I a little angel?
NICHOLAS: Take the picture out.

NICHOLAS: Take the picture out of the frame and show it to me.
CHRISTINE: I don't...
CHRISTINE: They're watching.
NICHOLAS: Wha... ?
CHRISTINE: Not here! They can see.
