JAEGER: Where is it? Where'd it go?
EPPS: Stay low.
JAEGER: Where the hell is it!?
EPPS: Just stay down.
JAEGER: What are we going to do? What the hell are we going to do?
EPPS: We're not going to do anything.
JAEGER: They're going to kill us!
EPPS: They can't shoot us in here.
WES: And they can't fly around out there forever.
EPPS: So we wait.
JAEGER: If they land--
EPPS: If they land, we can take them. If they don't land, then we've got nothing to worry about.
WES: Missile!
EPPS: Move!
