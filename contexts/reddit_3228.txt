Hairstylists of Reddit, do you enjoy your career?
I’ve always had a passion for beauty but have been scared to pursue it because it’s scary not knowing if I would actually be good at it and not make decent money. I’m almost 29 and so sick of the type of jobs I’ve had. I have a cleaning business that makes decent money but I don’t like the work. I’ve also worked as a leasing agent and done other office work which is soul crushing! I’m thinking it’s time to just bite the bullet and enroll into school or else I’ll always look back and think “what if”. And no, I don’t think of it as the easy way out. I know it’s hard to build etc. I’m just scared of the unknown :/

So my questions are:

1. How long did it take you to build a solid clientele?
2. Is reaching at least $50k profit possible? I’m in Roseville California. Lots of nice high end salons in my area. 
3. Did you start renting right away or assist?
4. Are most clients talkative? 
5. I have some social anxiety, will this career eat me alive because of this?
6. Are other stylist friendly and helpful or are they catty? 
7. What are your hours like? Like do you have to work from 9am - 9pm? Is having Sunday and Monday possible? 
8. Are you happy with your career choice?

Thanks for any advice! I appreciate it :3
