BETSY: She is alive, Mr. Holland -- that's all.
HOLLAND: Don't take it to heart, Betsy.
BETSY: I imagined this so differently...
HOLLAND: I've been waiting here for hours, trying to imagine Jessica well again -- wondering what I'd feel. I could see Jessica as she used to be, I could hear her say in that sweet mocking voice, Paul
BETSY: And instead, I came -- bringing you nothing.
HOLLAND: Instead -- you come, with sympathy, Betsy, and a generous heart. Don't forget that. Don't call it nothing.
