Do you guys fantasize about your suicide?
I think about it a lot. Like I imagine how it'll play out.

 Who would find me, the mess it would make, how my apartment would likely smell of my decomposing corpse and how that would likely give away what actually happened. The process of distributing my stuff and the pain my father and boyfriend would be going through. My co workers finding out, how they would all act surprised and pretend they never saw this coming. 

Do you guys go through the same thing?
