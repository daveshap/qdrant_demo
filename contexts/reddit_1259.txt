A week with no panic attacks!!
This time in January I was having debilitating panic attacks literally every day/all day and lost so much weight and became almost underweight because of it...6 months later, I am in therapy and on medication and just reached my first week without a single panic attack in 6 months, in addition to getting back to a healthy weight!! Wooooo!
