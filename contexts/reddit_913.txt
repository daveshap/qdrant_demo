I take my hat off to people who experience anxiety as a daily thing. You guys are true warriors
I get anxiety. I get a full on attack every 4/5 months that debilitates me for a couple of days. 
I feel for those of you dealing with this fucked up condition in a daily basis. 
I honestly don’t know how you do it. Feeling like this day in day out. 
I take my hat off to you guys ❤️
