The Biggest Problem With Anxiety is that It's Hard to Tell When Problems You're Having is ACTUALLY Caused by Anxiety
Case in point:

&#x200B;

I've had a tension-like headache for two fucking weeks and none of the doctors I've seen know what's causing it. 

&#x200B;

Anxiety? Could be.

&#x200B;

Not anxiety? Could be.

&#x200B;

Brain tumor? Probably. (This is a joke, but you guys probably get it.)

&#x200B;

That's just making the anxiety worse.
