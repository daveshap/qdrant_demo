HAGEN: Sir, the gentleman does not understand English. He would not in any case, take the stand. He came, at his own expense, to aid his brother in his trouble. He is not under any jurisdiction of our government and his reputation in his own country is impeccable.
SENATOR KANE: The witness is excused; take him out.
HAGEN: Senator Kane.
SENATOR KANE: This meeting is adjourned.
HAGEN: This committee owes an apology!
SENATOR KANE: The committee is adjourned until further notice.
