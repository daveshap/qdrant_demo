NICHOLAS: Tell me where we're going.
CONRAD: Just drive, man. It's fucking nuts!
NICHOLAS: What's this all about, Connie?
CONRAD: Shhhhhhh. Wait... wait...
NICHOLAS: What are you doing?
CONRAD: They're methodical. They're nothing if they're not that.
NICHOLAS: Who?
CONRAD: C.R.S. Who do you think? Jesus H., thank your lucky charms. To think what I almost got you into.
NICHOLAS: Yeah, almost...
CONRAD: You dodged a bullet.
NICHOLAS: How do you mean, exactly?
CONRAD: They fuck you and they fuck you and they fuck you. And then, just when you think it's done, that's when the <u>real</u> fucking begins.
NICHOLAS: Slow down, take a breath...
CONRAD: It doesn't stop, Nick. I paid the bill, I gave 'em their money, but it all started again. They won't leave me alone...
NICHOLAS: What have they been doing to you?
CONRAD: Everything. I'm a goddamn human-pinata...
NICHOLAS: Calm down. Why would they keep playing after you paid?
CONRAD: You think I know? I paid them <u>more</u> to make it stop.
