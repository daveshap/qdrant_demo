TOMMY: They're gone.
GUY: Where'd they go? Back inside?
GWEN: I don't know.
ALEXANDER: Nobody was WATCHING?
JASON: All right, Gwen, Alex, Fred, follow me. Guy, set up the perimeter. Tommy, you keep a lookout, make a signal if they come back.
TOMMY: What kind of signal?
JASON: Anything.
TOMMY: Okay, I'll do this... Caw Caw!""
JASON: Tommy, we have these...
TOMMY: Oh, right, sorry.
JASON: Okay, let's go.
TOMMY: You have no idea what a perimeter is, do you?
GUY: Not a clue. You?
TOMMY: I think he just likes pointing at things.
GWEN: How does the rolling help, actually?
JASON: It helps.
