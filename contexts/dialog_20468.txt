JUNIOR: Suit yourself.
RAOUL: Nobody leaves.
JUNIOR: Observe.
BURNHAM: We're not leaving. I'm getting in that room, and I'm opening that safe.
JUNIOR: Lookin' doubtful there, Big Guy, but ten out of ten for attitude.
SARAH: What if I spazz out?
MEG: No biggie, we've been through it a dozen times, I just jab you with the Glucogen.
SARAH: Where is the Glucogen?
MEG: Oh, you know, it's uh... it's in the little fridge in your room.
SARAH: I'm sorry, Mom.
MEG: Hey, quit apologizing, you're starting to sound like Grandma. You're not gonna have an attack. Okay?
SARAH: Okay.
