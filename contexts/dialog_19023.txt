FURIOUS: Let's go.
RAJA: Wait!... Look!
RAJA: This is bad.
SHOVELER: Who are they?
RAJA: The Disco Boys.
FURIOUS: The who?
RAJA: The most vicious gang of thugs this city ever produced. Twenty years ago they were Casanova's personal bodyguard. But after he was busted they crawled into the woodwork.
FURIOUS: Well they've crawled back out.
SHOVELER: We may be getting in over our heads here.
RAJA: This looks like a job for Superman --
SHOVELER: Or Batman --
RAJA: Or both.
