Thank you, Reddit, for keeping me alive
There's a lot of pain and sadness here, but there's also a lot of hope and a lot of people who genuinely care. More than most of the therapists I've ever had, to be honest. No one here is going to commit you to a hospital, or rat you out to your boss, or tell you to just cheer up and take a Zumba class \(seriously, I wish I were making that last one up\).

I came here a year ago because I wanted to kill myself. I spent a year here thinking about it. I've spent the past two months deciding that I \-don't\- want to kill myself. Someday in the future maybe I'll swing back to wanting it. You know what? No matter what, I'll always have this place to write my thoughts down, and I'll always have people here who will listen to my stupid problems. All that money spent on therapy and meds and the place that made me not want to kill myself was right here for free. Go figure.

I wish that the guy who killed himself two months ago \(would post his user name but I assume rules won't allow for that\) was here to read this. That his posts got me on this path in the first place. I hope he's at peace now, anyway. 

To everyone else, please keep on posting and replying to things. You're all fucking amazing.
