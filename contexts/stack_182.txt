iMac with a dead internal drive being used as a second monitor - booting and power efficiency I have an old 2012 iMac12,2 which had a fatal hard drive crash in early 2018 and has been running via booting from an external hard drive.I have connected the 2012 Model to a new 2017 iMac18,3 via a Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) to Thunderbolt 2 Adapter and a Thunderbolt 2 2M cable.Using \"Target Display Mode\" (Pressing CommandF2 ) I am using the 2012 iMac as a second monitor for the 2018 iMac.My question is 3-part: What is the best way to ensure that the 2012 iMac is running at lowest power usage and optimal efficiency while in Target Display Mode? I feel like the processor is working in the background, even though it is just being used as a monitor.When it turns on, it automatically tries to boot off the dead internal hard drive, which makes the computer crash. To avoid this, I have to hold \"Alt\" when it boots to be able to select the External USB drive (Which I already have loaded and set up with OSX). Is there any way to get it to automatically select the external hard drive to boot from?Once it is booted, is there a way to get it to automatically enter target display mode when it is booted?
