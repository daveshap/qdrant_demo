Short story about humans landing on a planet met with human-like aliens I'm looking for the title/author of a short story in which humans are living on a ship on another planet and they let in a human-looking male alien. The alien is (possibly) red-headed and very good-looking. The men on the ship all get sick, go through some sort of metamorphosis, and end up looking like the alien. They can then live outside the ship. Then a female alien comes up to the ship and the women on the ship have to decide whether to let her on or not.
