"In 3 hours it'll only be 1 hour until I have to go to work... In 2 hours it'll only be 1 hour... In 1 hour..."
Why am I like this? I don't go in until 4 for my part time job, yet it's like work controls my entire day even when I'm not there. I want to be productive on my own time here at home, but I can't seem to relax enough to get out of bed and stop looking at my phone.
