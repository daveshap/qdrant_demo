How do you cope with the death of a loved one?
I’m a 20 year old (not a teen but still young) who has never had to deal with the death of a loved one before, but a family members cancer has recently spread and the prognosis isn’t great. I have exams and finals around the corner. I honestly don’t know how to cope. I feel numb inside and don’t want to talk to anyone or do anything.
