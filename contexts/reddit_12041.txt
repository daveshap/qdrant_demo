This fucking cankersore.
I used to get then more when I was younger. They crop up when my immune system is low, I'm stressed and/or I'm not getting enough sleep. This week has been a combination of all three. I can't seem to keep up with my shitty life. It sucks when I feel like I am just trying to tread water and the pond is full of sewage. I am applying Orajel every hour or so in hopes that this will go away soon because no sleep and yes stress are both here for the foreseeable future.
