How can a former US President be indicted, arrested, and prosecuted?
Yesterday in the Congressional testimony of Robert Mueller, the former Special Counsel repeatedly said that the his office was not empowered to determine whether the president obstructed justice because of Department of Justice policy that the Department cannot indict the current president. However, [Mueller said that the president can be indicted after leaving office](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/07/24/robert-mueller-donald-trump-can-charged-after-leaving-office/1814190001/). And in detailed questioning, [Mueller agreed that all of the three requirements for obstruction charges were met](https://news.yahoo.com/mueller-edges-closer-to-saying-trump-committed-obstruction-160919062.html). Beyond the Mueller case, the president's  former personal lawyer [is currently in prison for crimes that he says the president directed him to commit](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/12/14/michael-cohen-gma-interview-trump/2309268002/), and [new evidence supports the president's involvement in those crimes](https://news.yahoo.com/michael-cohen-says-trump-directed-142437206.html). So it seems very likely that a prosecutor could pursue an indictment of the president if not for the DOJ policy, and that policy is valid only as long as the president remains in office. What procedures take effect after that?

In particular,

* How soon can it happen? Even if the prosecutors begin preparing a case in November, as soon as the election result shows that the sitting president is about to leave office, do they have to wait until he formally leaves office in January before they can convene a grand jury to consider an indictment? Or could they be ready to serve an indictment the moment the next president takes the oath of office? Or is every US Attorney obligated by ethics or policy to leave that matter to his or her successor if the incoming president chooses to appoint a new one?
* [Former presidents are guaranteed Secret Service protection for life](https://www.usatoday.com/story/theoval/2013/01/10/obama-secret-service-lifetime-protection-bush/1823961/); can the former president direct the Secret Service to block authorities who are trying to execute a lawful arrest warrant? Can anyone else direct the Secret Service to stand down?
* If the former president relocates to a country with no extradition treaty, can he or she keep Secret Service protection there? Or is anyone involved in the relocation potentially guilty of aiding a fugitive?
* [The statute of limitations for some crimes in question requires charges to be filed within five years.](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/trump-2020-win-could-run-out-clock-on-obstruction) If the president is re-elected and that clock therefore runs out in his or her second term, can prosecutors still argue that the statute of limitations is suspended ("tolled") while the president is in office and immune to prosecution? Are there other likely charges with longer statutes of limitations? Might the tolling question be decided differently for state charges instead of federal charges?
* Before he was [pardoned by his successor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pardon_of_Richard_Nixon), did prosecutors make these kinds of plans to indict former president Richard Nixon?
* What influence does the new president have over the possible prosecution of his or her predecessor? As we enter a new election cycle, have any candidates expressed a position on this?
