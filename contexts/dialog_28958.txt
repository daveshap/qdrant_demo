MARY: With your dry wit and humor--
DENBY: Oh yeah?--My personality put this thing over--
MARY: Maurice Chevalier! There's a fellow with personality.
DENBY: What's he got that I haven't got?
MARY: Well, he has a straw hat--
DENBY: So have I--I can get it right out of my trunk.
MARY: --And he has sex appeal.
DENBY: So what?
MARY: Get that out of your trunk.
DENBY: All right--don't spoil the trip with any of those jokes-- there's a nice bunch of people on this trip--nothing but class--I looked over the passenger list and they're all members of the Who's Who!
MARY: Never mind the Who's Who--Before I get on this boat I want to know What's What! How about my raise? All I get out of these ocean trips is dizzy.
DENBY: Don't blame it on the ocean!--All right, you'll get the raise!
MARY: Is that one of the Who's Who?
DENBY: No--He's probably one of the Here's How." Take it easy--the ocean's pretty rough today--"
DAN: I'll say--how fast is this boat going?
DENBY: Oh,--we're doing about thirty--
DAN: Pretty good--thirty <U>miles</U> an hour--
DENBY: No. <U>Knots</U>!
DAN: What?
DENBY: Knots!
DAN: I can see you're no gentleman--
MARY: He's funny--maybe you can use him in the show, Mr. Denby.
DAN: <U>Denby!</U>--Are you Chad Denby?
DENBY: That's me!
DAN: Not the <U>real</U> Chad Denby?--
DENBY: Yes--Me--in person!
DAN: So what?
