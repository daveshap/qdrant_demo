ACE: You better watch yourself. There's a lot of heat on you already.
NICKY: Why, somebody's complaining?
ACE: I'm - I'm hearin' things from security. They're all ex-cops. The Sheriff's lookin' to bust your balls. They want to put you in the Black Book.

ACE: Bullshit or no bullshit, they put you in that book, you're gonna be in a lot of trouble. You will not be able to walk into the casino. I'm tellin' you.
NICKY: What am I doin' out here? I'm tryin' to make a livin', that's all.
ACE: I'm just tellin' you. Don't say I didn't warn you.
NICKY: All right.
