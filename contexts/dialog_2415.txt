RICK: Huh? Wha...
DEBBIE: I can't sleep.
RICK: Oh... I got something for that.
DEBBIE: Stop fooling around... I need to talk.
RICK: What's the matter?
DEBBIE: I don't know... I just feel scared.
RICK: About what?
DEBBIE: The wedding, my parents, your family, our friends, my job, the future, our relationship, the caterers, my gown, your tuxedo, our honeymoon, the apartment, my shower, your bachelor party...
RICK: I think the only think you've left out are our relations with the Soviet Union. Sweetheart, everything's gonna be all right.
DEBBIE: Before or After I have my nervous breakfown?
RICK: C'mere.
DEBBIE: That feels so great.
RICK: Good...
DEBBIE: Um... that's very relaxing.
RICK: Now, I want you to lie down and drift off to slumberland.
