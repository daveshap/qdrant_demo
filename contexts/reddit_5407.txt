Fired because of 'no call/no show'.
I tried calling my manager in advance because I felt extremely ill that day. I even left her a message, but she never responded back. My question is: Would this affect me in the future when searching for a new job? I know I made a mistake and I deeply regret it, especially since it was my first job.
