I’m a college graduate with 6 years of experience. Why can’t I get hired anywhere?
I graduated back in May and I’ve been looking for a job ever since. I’ve only worked retail so naturally that was the first place for me to look. I’m under immense pressure from the people around me to get a job and I want a job but I’ve only caught a series of bad breaks since I graduated back in May. One of the companies I thought would hire me, baited and switched me. I saw a manager position I badly wanted and I’ve applied for  all of the similar positions that have popped up and the minimum requirements to become a manager is 2 or more years of college and I have a degree but every single time I apply, I’m sent the generic rejection email. I’m in full out desperation mode. I’ve been applying at so many different places including Walmart but haven’t gotten a call back or I’ve been rejected.  2 weeks ago I went to an interview at the electric company and found out that I’m competing against 6 other applicants and the electric company ghosted me as well. So now I’m in a situation where I’m wanting to be employed and every week seems like I’ll get a break but nothing ends up happening and I don’t get hired. And it doesn’t help that I’m under immense pressure to get a job.  I feel trapped and I’m not sure what to do.
