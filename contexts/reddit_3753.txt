Is anybody else not worried about the first date anymore, because you'll know you'll be ghosted right after?
I've been on a few dates and all of them end the same. They never talk to me again. I was going to have a date today, going out for breakfast, and I was thinking about why I wasn't nervous or anything. And then came to the realization, I probably won't to talk to her ever again. But who knows, there could be hope, considering she cancelled our date because she doesn't feel good... unfortunately like a dingus, I didn't check my phone and showed up to the place and waited for 5 minutes until I turn on my phone to tell her I was there.... Then I got the cancellation message.... ðŸ˜‘
