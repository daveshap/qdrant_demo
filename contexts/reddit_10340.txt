Depression has killed my brain
Literally.

I can't learn or understand new things. I dont even understand basic and simple shit. It's so fucking frustrating, especially when people call me out for the retarded shit that I do and I can't even understand that. I can't do anything anymore. My life is completely devoid of meaning.

I'm thinking about dying, but I just dont know yet.
