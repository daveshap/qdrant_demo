I got bullied about 10 years ago and I still want to beat my bully up if I get to see him.
When I was in middle school there was this kid that first posed as my friend and then all of the sudden started being super shitty to me and my little sister who was like 10 at the time. This kid was 13 just like me.

He was a real piece of shit to me and my sister. There are a lot of things he did but this would get longer if I say them. One is that my sister told my mom about it, my mom called his mom and they just showed up to my house. When they showed up, there was no apology, he knew what he did. The mom did all the talking protecting him and saying he was a nice kid, while he just sat there doing nothing. Couple of weeks after we had a semi fist fight. Nothing really happened because the bell rang and had to go to class.

He got saved and lucky, because if that happened right now with my 24 years old, I would probably have left him in the hospital. 

It just fills me with anger the fact that I did nothing about it, I never stood up to him. I found out a couple of years back that he lives in my city and I just wish I could find him and beat his sorry ass just to see his mommy cry about it.

It bothers me to be like this after 10 years, I guess the best thing is to not think about it and let it pass.
