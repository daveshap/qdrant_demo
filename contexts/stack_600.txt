Problem in connecting to Atmel Corp. AVR ISP mkII and FT232 USB-Serial (UART) IC I am using ubuntu 16.04 for programming purposes. When  I am trying to connect to my \"Atmel Corp. AVR ISP mkII microcontroller\" &amp; \"FT232 USB-Serial (UART) IC\" through my controller software application it doesn't get connected and gives out an error that \"inappropriate permissions on device!\". When I plug in the device, it is seen as /dev/ttyUSB0 being an FTDI chip.Any Idea on how to make the device get connected?
