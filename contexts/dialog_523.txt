CLAUDIA: Sandro, I don't want you to come with me, I don't want to see you... How can I make it clear to you?...Why did you come?
SANDRO: I don't know why. I just couldn't help it.
CLAUDIA: But sooner or later we've got to end this relationship. And it's better to do it right now.
SANDRO: I have no desire to sacrifice myself... It's idiotic to sacrifice oneself... Why?... For whom? If Anna were here I might understand your scruples. But she's not...
CLAUDIA: Oh, Sandro...
SANDRO: I'm sorry. I didn't want to sound cynical. But isn't it better to look things squarely in the eye?
CLAUDIA: For me they are exactly as they were when we met three days ago -- just three days ago... don't you realize? And you and Anna... No, I guess they aren't like that any more. My God, is it possible to forget in such a short time, for things to change so quickly?
SANDRO: It takes even less.
CLAUDIA: But it's so sad. So terribly sad. I'm not used to it, I'm not ready for it... You know... I have never been so upset in my life. Sandro, why don't you help me?
SANDRO: I think the only way to help ourselves, Claudia, is for us to be together.
CLAUDIA: No, I'm sure it won't. Move over there. Let's make believe nothing happened. And when we get to the next station, get off.
SANDRO: And what about you?
CLAUDIA: Me... I... I... Please leave me alone.
WOMAN'S VOICE: I work there but I'm really a stranger.
MAN'S VOICE: I tell you this acquaintance of mine knows you and she has often spoken to me about you.
WOMAN'S VOICE: And who is she? Does she work in Catania?
MAN'S VOICE: Yes, she takes care of the garden.
WOMAN'S VOICE: Then it's impossible for her to know me. In the villa where I'm at, we have a male gardener.
MAN'S VOICE: So? That's logical. You see, both being gardeners, they spoke about you to one another.
WOMAN'S VOICE: And what did they say about me?
MAN'S VOICE: They told me that you were a very nice girl, that you always mind your business... In other words, things of that sort.
WOMAN'S VOICE: We have a radio like this, too.
MAN'S VOICE: No, not like this one.
WOMAN'S VOICE: And why wouldn't we have one like this?
MAN'S VOICE: Because this is a Chinese radio.
WOMAN'S VOICE: Certainly a radio this small is very practical. It's especially useful for... I don't know... for traveling.
MAN'S VOICE: But for you, what comes first: music or love?
WOMAN'S VOICE: Music, of course. To get a sweetheart, one has to look around, but to get a radio, all you have to do is buy one.
MAN'S VOICE: Ah, no... For me, love comes first. I'm a man, and I know what's what: first love, and then music.
SANDRO: Claudia, listen to me...
CLAUDIA: No, Sandro, please... I ask you as a favor...
CLAUDIA: Promise that you won't try to look for me... you shouldn't try to look for me any more...
SANDRO: But why, Claudia?... Why?
