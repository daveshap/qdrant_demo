Does the proposed 'Unmasking Antifa Act of 2018' bill violate the first amendment?
There is a bill that was introduced in the House last month called the 'Unmasking Antifa Act of 2018'.

Here is the bill in question: [https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/6054/text](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/6054/text) and a summary:

>Under the act, anyone “wearing a mask” or in disguise who “injures, oppresses, threatens, or intimidates any person … in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege” would be subject to a fine or up to 15 years in prison.

And a link to The Hill ([http://thehill.com/homenews/house/396404-unmasking-antifa-act-includes-15-year-prison-term-proposal](http://thehill.com/homenews/house/396404-unmasking-antifa-act-includes-15-year-prison-term-proposal)) has more information.

My question is this, what are the arguments for and against this in the context of the Constitution? What sorts of precedent would such arguments reference?
