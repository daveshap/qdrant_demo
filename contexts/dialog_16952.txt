JORGE: [I don't know! We work in parts. A voice calls in a kidnapping. We deliver the target to the guardians. We don't even know them. They might transfer to other guardians. The negotiators and the bosses don't even see the target. They just make the deal!]
CREASY: [Who ordered it?]
JORGE: [The cops call him 'The Dreamer'.]
CREASY: [Where do I find him?]
JORGE: [I don't know. No one knows.]
JORGE: [I don't know, I swear.]
CREASY: [I believe you.]
JORGE: [I'm professional. I just do my job.]
CREASY: [Me, too. Tell me about the guardians.]
JORGE: [He called me on the cell phone to set a time and location for the switch.]
CREASY: [Who's he?]
JORGE: [The one who transferred Pinta to their car.]
CREASY: Who's he?
JORGE: I don't know, but I know his face.
JORGE: [I see him sometimes at the handball court in Chapultepec on a Saturday afternoon.]
CREASY: [How do I recognize him.]
JORGE: [He has a tattoo covering two-thirds of his back. He is part of the Brotherhood.]
CREASY: [In the next hour, where do I find your partner?]
JORGE: [One-one-three Arco Iris. Third floor.]
