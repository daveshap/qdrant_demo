School is hard, man.
I'm an English major, currently a junior. You see, I've always been very good at school. I kinda just costed through and got A's. Well, this year has kicked my butt. I used to think getting anything less than an A was the end of the world, but lately I've been of the mind set that C's get degrees lol. I'm just worried that the papers I'm working on now are not even C worthy, but I really am trying my best. At this point it feels like I'm kinda winging it and my connections between my research and my own thoughts are a bit of a stretch. I'm slightly worried about failing because I don't want to have to do another semester or two of school to make up for classes, you know? I'm trying my best and I just don't know if its good enough anymore.

Just wanted to express my woes and maybe someone will relate. Thanks for reading.
