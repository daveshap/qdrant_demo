JIM: What was his voice like?
ANDREWS: You knew you weren't talking to some low life fag, you know. He had command of the king's English.
JIM: Did he pay?
ANDREWS: Always - like tits on a pig. I wish I had a million of those bimbettes.
JIM: And Oswald?
ANDREWS: Like I told to the Washington boys, Bertrand called that summer and asked me to help the kid upgrade his Marine discharge...
JIM: So you saw Oswald how many times?
ANDREWS: Three, four. He came in with a few Cubano swishes one time I remember...
JIM: Recall any names?
ANDREWS: Mario, Jose - they wear names like you and I wear clothes. Today the name is Candy, tomorrow it's Butsie. I wish I could help you, Jim.
JIM: Did you speak to Oswald in Dallas?
ANDREWS: Hell, no! I told this Bertrand cat right off, this isn't my scene, man. I deal with muni court, I'm a hack in nigger town, that kid needs a hot dog.
JIM: Then how the hell did you get in the Warren Commission, Dean? Except through the phone records in the Dallas jail?
ANDREWS: There were no phone records.
JIM: Of course there weren't. 'Cause they disappeared. And yet the Commission found you, Dean.
ANDREWS: I don't know how they got to me. Maybe cause I repped him here. The Feebees run background checks. On my mama's breasts, man, that's all I got. There wasn't no conspiracy, Jim. If there were, why the hell didn't Bobby Kennedy prosecute it as Attorney General, he was his brother for Chrissake. How the fuck three people could keep a secret like that, I don't know. It was Oswald. He was a nut job. Faggot, y'know, hated this country.
