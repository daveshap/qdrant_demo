BUDDY: Whoa, check this out. She looks like you.
CINDY: Wow, she's beautiful. You really think she looks like me?
BUDDY: Her hair doesn't have as many split ends at yours. Her skin isn't as oily as yours, either. Also, sometimes your eyes get kinda squinty and they look like you might have Down's Syndrome or something. Otherwise the resemblance is uncanny.
BUDDY: Oh yeah... another difference is she looks more sophisticated and classy. More feminine. And her tits are perfect. Not pointy and funny looking, or spaced too far apart...
CINDY: Alright!
