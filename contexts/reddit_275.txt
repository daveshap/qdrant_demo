I can't decide..
Ive been dating someone for nearly 3 years now with occasional breakups. During one of them I dated a girl named Rose and she was amazing but... after a while my old gf came back and was crying wanting me back so I left Rose. I recently started talking to her again and I can feel that she still likes me and I want to go for it but... she lives across the country and my current gf threatens suicide so I just cant decide anymore. Rose is the most amazing girl ive ever met and I can talk to her for hours but my current gf Ive just lost interest but I cant leave because everyone in my school would hate me, i would risk causing suicide... im just stuck okay? Sorry for the rantyness I just really need advice. Thanks in advance.

Edit: i understand I should break up with my gf but i dont know how because theyre one of my best friends. I cant hurt them.

Edit #2: I know that it might not have been a good decision to go to Rose immediately but it felt.. right. I couldnt be more glad I did what I did because Rose is just the best person ive ever met. I guess ive just learned from this that you need to just let go sometimes. Something you all should know is well, wait for that someone special. Dont use dating apps, dont look for a partner; make friends and if one of them makes you feel special then ask them, just go for it.
