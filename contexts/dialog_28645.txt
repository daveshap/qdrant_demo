JAEGER: This is stupid. It's going on a month now. How long are they going to let the Air Force piss on those bastards? They can bomb them all they want, Saddam ain't going anywhere without a ground assault. What the hell is the army waiting for?
EPPS: Why you in such a hurry to get to shooting?
JAEGER: I've got to have something to tell people when I get home besides I protected a stretch of dirt that nobody wanted for nothing in the first place.
WES: The longer the air force hits the Iraqis, the safer it'II be for us when we have to engage.
JAEGER: You know what, Wes? If you get a note from your mommy they might excuse you from the war.
EPPS: You all want to lay off? God. I hope the Iraqis shoot me; put me out of my misery.
JAEGER: OH MY GOD!
EPPS: What!? What!?
JAEGER: I did it! I got the box open.
