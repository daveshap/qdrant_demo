WHALE: Good morning.
CLAY: Mornin'.
WHALE: My name is Whale. This is my house.
CLAY: Nice place.
WHALE: And your name is --?
CLAY: Boone. Clayton Boone.
WHALE: I couldn't help but notice your tattoo. That phrase? Death Before Dishonor. What does it mean?

WHALE: The Marines. Good for you. You must have served in Korea.
WHALE: Getting to be a warm day. A scorcher, as you Yanks call it.
CLAY: Yeah. I better get on with my work.
