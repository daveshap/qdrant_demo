JERRY: Oh - Sugar!
SUGAR: I wanted to thank you for covering for me. You're a real pal.
JERRY: It's nothing. I just think us girls should stick together.
SUGAR: If it hadn't been for you, they would have kicked me off the train. I'd be out there in the middle of nowhere, sitting on my ukulele.
JERRY: It must be freezing outside. When I think of you - and your poor ukulele -
SUGAR: If there's anything I can do for you -
JERRY: Oh, I can think of a million things -
JERRY: And that's one of them.
SUGAR: Sssh. Sweet Sue.
SUGAR: I don't want her to know we're in cahoots.
JERRY: We won't tell anybody - not even Josephine.
SUGAR: I'd better stay here till she goes back to sleep.
JERRY: Stay as long as you'd like.
SUGAR: I'm not crowding you, am I?
JERRY: No. It's nice and cozy.
SUGAR: When I was a little girl, on cold nights like this, I used to crawl into bed with my sister. We'd cuddle up under the covers, and pretend we were lost in a dark cave, and were trying to find out way out.
JERRY: Interesting.
SUGAR: Anything wrong?
JERRY: No, no.
SUGAR: Why you poor thing - you're trembling all over.
JERRY: That's ridiculous.
SUGAR: And your head is hot.
JERRY: That's ridiculous.
SUGAR: And you've got cold feet.
JERRY: Isn't that ridiculous?
SUGAR: Let me warm them a little. There - isn't that better?
JERRY: I'm a girl, I'm a girl, I'm a girl -
SUGAR: What did you say?
JERRY: I'm a very sick girl.
SUGAR: Maybe I'd better go before I catch something.
JERRY: I'm not that sick.
SUGAR: I have a very low resistance.
JERRY: Look, Sugar, if you feel you're coming down with something, the best thing is a shot of whiskey.
SUGAR: You got some?
JERRY: I know where to get some. Don't move.
SUGAR: You all right?
JERRY: I'm fine.
SUGAR: How's the bottle?
JERRY: Half-full.
