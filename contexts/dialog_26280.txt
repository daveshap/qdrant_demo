NORMA: Did you see them? Did you see how they came?
DE MILLE: You know, crazy things happen in this business. I hope you haven't lost your sense of humor ...
DEMILLE: What's the matter, Norma?
NORMA: Nothing. I just didn't realize what it would be like to come back to the old studio. I had no idea how I'd missed it.
DEMILLE: We've missed you too, dear.
NORMA: We'll be working again, won't we, Chief? We'll make our greatest picture.
DEMILLE: That's what I want to talk to you about.
NORMA: It's a good script, isn't it?
DEMILLE: It's got a lot of good things. Of course, it would be an expensive picture...
NORMA: I don't care about the money. I just want to work again. You don't know what it means to know that you want me.
DEMILLE: Nothing would thrill me more -- if it were possible.
NORMA: But remember, darling -- I don't work before ten in the morning, and never after 4:30 in the afternoon.
1ST ASSISTANT: We're ready with the shot, Mr. deMille.
DEMILLE: You'll pardon me, Norma? Why don't you just sit and watch? O.K. Here we go.
1ST ASSISTANT: Roll 'em.
DEMILLE: Action! The scene starts.
MAX: You see those offices there, Mr. Gillis? They used to be her dressing room, The whole row.
GILLIS: That didn't leave much for Wallace Reid.
MAX: He had a great big bungalow on wheels. I had the upstairs. See where it says 'Readers' Department'? I remember my walls were covered with black patent leather...
