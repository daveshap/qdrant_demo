If you tend to feel fatigued, depressed or in pain, try boosting your Vitamin D levels
According to a [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21310306) from several years ago, 41.6% of adults in the United States are Vitamin D **deficient**, which means high likelihood of feeling fatigued, in pain, and depressed. Especially if you live in areas with low levels of sunlight, or work in a corporate environment, your Vitamin D deficiency could be contributing to depression. 

If you're unable to find time to go outside and get natural Vitamin D, try taking 1000 IU of Vitamin D supplements each day. I noticed a radical change in my mood when I did. Hope this helps.
