WELLES: It's my birthday this week. I'll be 26.
SCHAEFER: Happy birthday.
MANK: Monstro! Ran into Walter Winchell outside He wants to play Herod in the picture. Hiya, George.
SCHAEFER: Herman.
MANK: So ain't this just the bee's knees? The high muckey-mucks dolled up all Aztec-like for the human sacrifice.
WELLES: You gonna watch?
MANK: Hell, I know how it ends. Hey, Rosebud's the sled!
WELLES: Mank!
MANK: Face it, Orson, they're gonna hate it. I told you, not enough closeups and too many scenes with a bunch of New York actors.
SCHAEFER: Oh God. . .
WELLES: Relax, George. It's gonna go great. Trust me. Have I ever lied to you?
SCHAEFER: You know something, Orson, you haven't done anything but lie to me from the moment we met. But, ya know, I'd do it again in a second.
WELLES: It was fun, wasn't it?
SCHAEFER: It was the best, kid
WELLES: So, on to the Life Of Christ!
SCHAEFER: Without me. I'm afraid. I got the axe this morning.
MANK: Shit
WELLES: George...
