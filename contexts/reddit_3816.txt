Biggest dating mistakes Iâ€™ve made
22f here, Let this help you guys out, coming from a screw up like me. Learn from this, and avoid doing what I did. 

1. Seeing every guy/girl you meet as a potential love life. 

The truth is a big pill thatâ€™s hard to swallow, but that mindset is a sign youâ€™re desperate to fall inlove. Donâ€™t be. Falling in love with you is a privelege reserve to only one person. Stop looking at a person and thinking this could be the one. Thatâ€™s just adding pressure to yourself and unwanted expectations along the way. 

2. Opening up to people too much. 

I used to think that people will open up to you if you open up to them. No, not really. Well,at least not immediately. 

Let them earn the real you. It takes time. 

3. Rushing 

There was this boy I met, Philip, It was going good for the first part. But I think I scared him away because I wanted to be with him as soon as possible. 

You see everybody is afraid of the idea of committing, thats why dating is hard. Weâ€™re afraid of the risks.

4. Focusing too much on a person 

Enjoy your life. If he doesnt reply, so what? Then go do something you enjoy. WatchTV, go jogging, talking to him isnt the only thing you can do. 

If he cancels, then go make other plans. 

The only person you should focus on is you. 

To whoever reads this, Love is hard. But how do you know you can love someone else, if you cant love yourself ?
