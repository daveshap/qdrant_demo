Stuck in grad school for another month, how to approach job search?
I'm studying data visualization / web development / design in grad school. I need to complete a thesis by April and have been super busy. My goal of going to grad school is to get a full-time job. I've been applying to them since January with limited results: most don't get back to me. I've had a couple of successful referrals, but they both needed me to start right away, which I could not do, so they told me to reach back out after I was done.

Because I've been so busy, I really haven't been able to give the job search my due diligence. I'm interested in moving to another city and exploring a variety of opportunities, but school has just been too much, and I can't commit right now. Recently, another job referral popped up, but I'm afraid it will be like other two, in that they'd want me to start right away (as soon as I graduate) and I wouldn't have time to interview other places.

Should I just wait until I graduate and then commit to giving the job search my best effort for a few months? I don't have to worry about rent until September. I just kick myself every time a cool job pops up, and feel guilty about not applying, like it could be a missed opportunity. However, I know that I want to look around before accepting the first thing that pops up. I've been in school for two years and the job search is so important to me, but it's not something I've been able to invest in fully.
