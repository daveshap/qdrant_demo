Technology related jobs/internship for a 17 year old?
To keep it short, I'm a senior in a prestigious high school that focuses on technology. Namely Cyber Security. Started with computers in the 4th grade.

I know lots (or so i feel/am told i do) about computer hardware, smart phones, computer networking.

I'm working at a retail job which I hate right now and would really like to think there are jobs out there related to what I've listed. I've also thought about getting an internship, but where do I find one?

but I also realize that most jobs like so are full time and require other things like certificates/higher education. even something like best buy which is barely related to technology sounds nice (although also retail)

just need some ideas of what I can do with the background of going to such a high school and having those skills
