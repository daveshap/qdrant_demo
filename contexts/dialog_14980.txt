VANESSA: Well, shall we start looking over the paperwork? Gerta has already drafted some preliminary documents.
JUNO: Can I use the facilities first? Being pregnant makes you pee like Seabiscuit.
VANESSA: Sure. The powder room down here is being re-tiled, but you can use the master bath upstairs. Go up, then turn left and on your right...
JUNO: Room with a toilet, got it.
JUNO: Whoops! Yikes, I didn't expect to see you up here.
MARK: Sorry. I was just getting something.
JUNO: Did your wife send you up here to spy on me?
MARK: What? No! Do we come off like paranoid yuppies or something?
JUNO: Well, you don't just invite a random pregnant teenager into your house and leave her unsupervised. I could be a total klepto, for all you know.
MARK: I don't get a klepto vibe from you. Evil genius? Maybe. Arsonist? Wouldn't rule it out.
JUNO: I did steal a squirt of perfume. What do you think? It's Clinique Happy.
