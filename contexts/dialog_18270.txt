RAYMOND: I feel great I got no sleep but I feel like Orlando Furioso!
RITA: You were a tiger last night.
RAYMOND: And you were a lamb. As soft as milk.
RITA: Shut up. They'll hear you in the back.
RAYMOND: So what? The pleasure of marriage is you sleep with the woman and then you don't worry about nothing. Hey, how about a date tonight, Rita. Let's eat pasta and roll around.
RITA: Raymond, Raymond, lower your voice! What's got into you?
RAYMOND: I don't know! That moon! That crazy moon Cosmo sent over!
LORETTA: Hi.
RAYMOND: Hey there ...YOU WITH THE STARS IN YOUR EYES...
LORETTA: What's the matter with him?
RITA: You got me.
RAYMOND: You see that moon last night?
LORETTA: What about the moon?
RAYMOND: Did you see it?
LORETTA: No.
RAYMOND: Oh.
LORETTA: Listen, I gotta go. I'll take the deposit to the bank but I'll do the books tomorrow. I gotta go.
RAYMOND: You gotta date?
RITA: What are you talking about, you fool? Her fianc√©'s in Palermo.
RAYMOND: Oh. Right.
LORETTA: I got things to do.
RITA: Sure you do. You got all that wedding stuff.
LORETTA: Right.
