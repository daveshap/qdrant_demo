Maximum realistic salinity level with thriving aquatic environment? I'm trying to create a planet which environment is not immediately lethal to humans, (reasonable oxygen level) however after closer inspection turns out not to be specially Earth-like.One issues is its hydrosphere. Over 90% of planet surface is water (or ice). It's rather cold tidally locked planet, so to have a reasonable excuse why the water is still liquid, I'd prefer to beef up salinity.Which is acceptable salinity level in which carbon based life as we know it could realistically thrive? By thrive I don't mean local equivalent of toughest archaea and tiny brine shrimps, but existence of bigger organisms, which weight exceeds at least kilogram)
