SIMON: For the best little computer officer on the Mercury mission.
ELAINE: Simon.
SIMON: Who would believe that Elaine Thompson was once a stewardess on the Denver-Chicago run.
ELAINE: And I can hardly believe that I'm engaged to someone like you, Simon. I'm a very lucky woman.
SIMON: Women <u>and</u> the space program have come a long way, sweetheart. But after the wedding, no more complicated computers for my little girl.
ELAINE: But, darling, they've offered me a chance to head up the computer analysis division for the Jupiter probe.
SIMON: You're heading up the division in charge of babies for Mr. and Mrs. Simon Kurtz.
