I need of help/advice to save a friendship
Alright I posted this on my last one, about me and my best friend’s(perhaps ex) relationship. What should I do, when should I tell them that I love them. I gave them space but I said something that I shouldn’t have on Thursday. Should I keep giving them space or tell them immediately?
