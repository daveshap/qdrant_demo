comparing the means of multiple distributions I wish to compare the means of three independent data sets.  These are exam scores that are from class A and class B and class C.  Class A and B are normal and tested ok for homogeneity.  A T-Test between class A and B revealed that the sets are significantly different and looking at the mean and median, and I determined class A performed better than B (examining the means).  When comparing the means between A and C and then B and C using the Mann Whitney U test, the both scenarios didn't show significance.  I thought that the comparison between A and C would test significant being b/c of the results of the T-Test.I recently learned that when doing a multiple amount of comparisons, I have to apply the Bonferroni correction to my p value (p => .05/3 => .0167).  When comparing the means of A/B, B/C and A/C using p = .0167 all of the result comparison showed no significance.  My question is,..when I write my results, should I determine there was no significant relationship found between the settings.  That is to say, it wasn't found class A, B and C performed alike?I don't think I should ignore the T Test result b/c a parametric test is always better.  What do you think?Thanks for your help in advance.
