FRY: He can pilot?
JOHNS: Hijacked a prison transport, made a helluva good run 'fore I tracked him down.
FRY: Okay, maybe that's a <u>good</u> thing. Maybe I can use him to help with --
JOHNS: He also figured out how to kill the pilot, Fry.
FRY: You said we were going to trust him now. You said there was a deal.
JOHNS: That's what I said.
FRY: Oh, this is a dangerous game you're playing, Johns.
JOHNS: May've noticed chains don't work on this guy. Only way we're truly safe is if he believes he's goin' free. But if he <u>stops</u> believin' --
FRY: You mean, if he learns that you're gonna royally fuck him over.
JOHNS: -- we need a fail-safe. Bring the cells over at the last possible minute -- when the wings are ready, when we <u>know</u> we're ready to launch.
FRY: You know, he hasn't harmed any of us. Far as I can tell, he hasn't even lied to us. Just stick to the deal, Johns. Let him go if that's what it --
JOHNS: He's a murderer. The law says he's gotta do his bid.
FRY: Dancin' on razor blades here...
JOHNS: I won't give him a chance to grab another ship -- or to slash another pilot's throat.
