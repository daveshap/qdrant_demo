SUPERGIRL: Zaltar, please help me.
ZALTAR: Of course, my dear. What can I do?
SUPERGIRL: Help me to get back to Earth. Where my friends are. They need me.
ZALTAR: There's no way out of the Zone. No one's ever escaped. That's why they send the criminals here.
SUPERGIRL: If there's a way in, there must be a way out.
ZALTAR: No, that's not true---there's well...no--
ZALTAR: There is a way.
SUPERGIRL: I knew it!
ZALTAR: But it's impossible.
SUPERGIRL: Why?
ZALTAR: No, it wouldn't work, you couldn't, it's too--- if it didn't work you'd be swept into a singularity--- no, you'd never make it. Forget I mentioned it.
