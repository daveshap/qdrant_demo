Given Negative Reivew at New Job Worried About my Future
I started a new job with a government contractor about three months ago.   

The other week I had my 60-day review with the company, and the feedback was extremely negative. They said I was "unprofessional', 'profane',  a 'slow learner" among others according to the client's review.  

They assigned me some extra HR training online, and the HR point of contact sent me a followup with the review in writing while chastising me again.

They also said they are extending the orientation period in my review and want to "follow up" with me again in about 15 or so days.

Am I about to be fired?

In the meantime, I've generally been quiet around the office, and things have been going smoothly (knock on wood), my immediate supervisor thinks I'm progressing with my learning, etc.

Should I continue to worry outside of focusing on doing a better job?
