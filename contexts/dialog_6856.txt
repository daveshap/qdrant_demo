KATHRYN: What's wrong with you?
SEBASTIAN: You ready for this? I've recently discovered that our good friend Mrs. Caldwell is the one who sent the letter to Annette urging her to stay away from me.
KATHRYN: Interesting.
SEBASTIAN: I now plan to devote all my energies to destroying the douche bag. Any luck corrupting her daughter?
KATHRYN: No.
SEBASTIAN: Call Cecile up and get her to come over. I'll bust that cherry in a heartbeat.
KATHRYN: The plot thickens. It appears that Cecile has fallen for her music teacher.
SEBASTIAN: Ooo, I'm sure Mrs. Caldwell will love that.
KATHRYN: Not to mention Court Reynolds. Unfortunately, Ronald's moving with the speed of a Special Olympic Bobsledder.
SEBASTIAN: What's your plan of attack?
KATHRYN: I rat Cecile out to mommy. Mommy goes ballistic and ends their relationship. Boo hoo.
SEBASTIAN: But who will they turn to for help?
