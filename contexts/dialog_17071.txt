SPRINGFIELD: The Commissioner was saying you were the one that caught Dr. Lecktor three years ago. He killed nine people, didn't he?
GRAHAM: Nine that we know of. Two didn't die.
SPRINGFIELD: What happened to them?
GRAHAM: One's on the respirator at a hospital in Baltimore. The other is in a private mental hospital in Denver.
SPRINGFIELD: What did the psychologists say was wrong with Lecktor?
GRAHAM: Psychologists call him a sociopath. They don't know what else to call him.
SPRINGFIELD: What would you call him?
SPRINGFIELD: To yourself...
GRAHAM: I call him a monster.
SPRINGFIELD: I understand he cut you pretty good...
GRAHAM: What about the dog?
SPRINGFIELD: It's at the vet's. The kids brought it in with a puncture wound in the abdomen. icepick or an awl.
GRAHAM: Was the dog wearing a collar with the Leeds' name on it?
SPRINGFIELD: No.
GRAHAM: Did the Jacobis in Birmingham have a dog?
CRAWFORD: A cat. We found a litter box downstairs but not the cat. Neighbors are watching for it.
GRAHAM: Why don't you get Birmingham P.D. a methane probe out of D.C. and have them cover the backyard... maybe the cat's dead and the kids buried it.
