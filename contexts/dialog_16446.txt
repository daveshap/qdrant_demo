HARRY: You know, it's such a fucking waste. You can do shit most of us can only dream about, and you go around pretending it's some trick.
SWANN: Illusionists get. Las Vegas contracts, D'Amour. Magicians get burned.
HARRY: Or murdered, like Nix.
SWANN: He deserved it.
HARRY: Maybe he doesn't see it that way. Maybe he's digging his way out of the hole you put him right now. That's what you're hiding away from, isn't it?
SWANN: I did it for Dorothea.
HARRY: Oh yeah?
SWANN: Now that I'm dead, the spotlight's off her.
HARRY: So Nix won't come looking for her?
SWANN: It's me betrayed him.
HARRY: And she shot him I I think that'd piss me off if I were Nix.
SWANN: I don't know what else to do.
HARRY: Help me.
