All together vs altogether for results In editing science papers, I routinely come across the phrase \"Altogether, these results suggest that...\" I have changed it to \"All together\" because it seems to me that the phrase is referring to considering all of the results together. But I have seen \"Altogether\" so many times that I decided to look it up again, and now I am unsure. Perhaps the meaning is \"All in all, these results suggest that...\"The examples I have seen in Garner's and Grammar Girl don't really match this situation. For example, \"Altogether, I have too many socks\" vs \"My socks are all together in my dresser.\" I am still leaning toward \"All together\" because it is modifying \"these results\" whereas in the example of \"altogether\" above, it is modifying \"I have\".Or perhaps because it is ambiguous, I should leave it as is?
