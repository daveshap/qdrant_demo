MARTIN: Well, according to Maritime law, you, as commander of the Shack have the authority to dispose of the body. However, the company doesn't want you to do that.
BECK: What you don't understand is that my crew is in jeopardy.
MARTIN: But you don't have any proof at this point to assume that this disease is contagious, do you?
BECK: I'm not anxious to find out, either.
MARTIN: Beck, trust me. If the company felt that you or your crew were in any danger we would authorize an immediate emergency pickup. We could be there in a few hours.
BECK: Do it.
MARTIN: Unfortunately. We can't.
BECK: What're you saying? That we're not even going to be picked up tomorrow?
MARTIN: It shouldn't be a long delay.
BECK: But it's a delay! How long? A day? Two days?!
MARTIN: Twelve hours, no big deal. We should know something first thing in the morning. Don't worry.
