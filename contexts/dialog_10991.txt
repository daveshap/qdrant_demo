MOSS: Oh, yes, George.
AARONOW: What does that mean?
MOSS: Listen to this. I have an alibi, I'm going to the Como Inn, why? Why? The place gets robbed, they're going to come looking for me. Why? Because I probably did it. Are you going to turn me in? George? Are you going to turn me in?
AARONOW: What if you don't get caught?
MOSS: They come to you, you going to turn me in?
AARONOW: Why would they come to me?
MOSS: They're going to come to everyone.
AARONOW: Why would I do it?
MOSS: You wouldn't, George, that's why I'm talking to you. Answer me. They come to you. You going to turn me in?
AARONOW: No.
MOSS: Are you sure?
AARONOW: Yes. I'm sure.
MOSS: Then listen to this: I have to get those leads tonight. That's something I have to do. If I'm not at the movies...if I'm not eating over at the inn...If you don't do this, then I have to come in here...
AARONOW: ...you don't have to come in...
MOSS: ...and rob the place...
AARONOW: ...I thought that we were only talking...
MOSS: ...they take me, then. They're going to ask me who were my accomplices.
AARONOW: Me?
MOSS: Absolutely.
AARONOW: That's ridiculous.
MOSS: Well, to the law, you're an accessory. Before the fact.
AARONOW: I didn't ask to be.
MOSS: Then tough luck, George, because you are.
AARONOW: Why? Why, because you only told me about it?
MOSS: That's right.
AARONOW: Why are you doing this to me, Dave. Why are you talking this way to me? I don't understand. Why are you doing this at all...?
MOSS: That's none of your fucking business...
AARONOW: Well, well, well, talk to me, we sat down to eat dinner, and here I'm a criminal...
MOSS: You went for it.
AARONOW: In the abstract...
MOSS: So I'm making it concrete.
AARONOW: Why?
MOSS: Why? Why you going to give me five grand?
AARONOW: Do you need five grand?
MOSS: Is that what I just said?
AARONOW: You need money? Is that the...
MOSS: Hey, hey, let's just keep it simple, what I need is not the...what do you need...?
AARONOW: What is the five grand? What is the, you said that we were going to split five...
MOSS: I lied. Alright? My end is my business. Your end's twenty-five. In or out. You tell me, you're out you take the consequences.
AARONOW: I do?
MOSS: Yes.
AARONOW: And why is that?
MOSS: Because you listened.
ROMA: ...all train compartments smell vaguely of shit. It gets so you don't mind it. That's the worst thing that I can confess. You know how long it took me to get there? A long time. When you die you're going to regret the things you don't do. You think you're queer...? I'm going to tell you something: we're all queer. You think that you're a thief? So what? You get befuddled by a middle-class morality...? Get shut of it. Shut it out. You cheated on your wife...? You did it, live with it. You fuck little girls, so be it. There's an absolute morality? May be. And then what? If you think there is, then be that thing. Bad people go to hell? I don't think so. If you think that, act that way. A hell exists on earth? Yes. I won't live in it. That's me. You ever take a dump made you feel you'd just slept for twelve hours...?
LINGK: Did I...?
ROMA: Yes.
LINGK: I don't know.
ROMA: Or a piss...? A great meal fades in reflection. Everything else gains. You know why? 'Cause it's only food. This shit we eat, it keeps us going. But it's only food. The great fucks that you may have had. What do you remember about them?
LINGK: What do I...?
ROMA: Yes.
LINGK: Mmmm...
ROMA: I don't know. For me, I'm saying, what is is, it's probably not the orgasm. Some broads, forearms on your neck, something her eyes did. There was a sound she made...or, me, lying, in the, I'll tell you: me lying in bed; the next day she brought me caf√© au lait. She gives me a cigarette, my balls feel like concrete. Eh? What I'm saying, what is our life? It's looking forward or it's looking back. And that's our life. That's it. Where is the moment? And what is it that we're afraid of? Loss. What else? The bank closes. We get sick, my wife died on a plane, the stock market collapsed...the house burnt down...what of these happen...? None on 'em. We worry anyway. What does this mean? I'm not secure. How can I be secure? Through amassing wealth beyond all measure? No. And what's beyond all measure? That's a sickness. That's a trap. There is no measure. Only greed. How can we act?
