ANTHONY: She's really kind of hot.
DIGNAN: She's an attractive older woman.
BOB: Well, what do you think?
DIGNAN: I don't know, Bob. What about one of those?
BOB: I'm not allowed to drive those.
DIGNAN: Not even for emergencies?
BOB: No.
DIGNAN: I thought your parents were in Italy.
BOB: They are.
DIGNAN: So who's going to know?
BOB: My brother.
ANTHONY: Future Man.
BOB: Who?
ANTHONY: Future Man. You know. Cause he looks like he's from the future.
DIGNAN: He looks like he was designed by scientists. For desert warfare.
BOB: That never would of --
DIGNAN: Let's cut the bullshit.
ANTHONY: It's got a V-8, Dignan.
DIGNAN: What do you think the cops have?
BOB: If you're that worried, maybe we should just steal one.
DIGNAN: What are you talking about, Bob?
BOB: Can you use a coaster.
ANTHONY: Did you ever steal a car before?
BOB: Yeah. I've stolen two cars before. One Jaguar. And one Trans-Am. With T- Tops. That Trans-Am was fun to drive.
DIGNAN: You stole a Trans-Am.
BOB: Yes. I did.
DIGNAN: OK, Bob.
BOB: It's true, Dignan.
DIGNAN: Well. What do you want to do? You want to steal one or just drive your car?
BOB: I'll just drive my car.
DIGNAN: Anthony, we'll get two hundred for the coin collection alone. That's less than what it's appraised at.
ANTHONY: But Dignan, do you really know that much about rare coins?
DIGNAN: I know about money, Anthony. I know the value of money. Plus the earrings are worth three times that.
