DR. LECTER: Plum Island Animal Disease Research Center." Sounds charming."
CLARICE: That's just part of the island. It has a very nice beach. Terns nest there.
DR. LECTER: Terns... If I help you, Clarice, it will be turns" with us
CLARICE: Go, Doctor.
DR. LECTER: What's your worst memory of childhood? Quicker than that. I'm not interested in your worst invention.
CLARICE: The death of my father.
DR. LECTER: Tell me. Don't lie, or I'll know.
CLARICE: He was a town marshal... one night he surprised two burglars, coming out the back of a drugstore... They shot him.
DR. LECTER: Killed outright?
CLARICE: No. He was strong, he lasted almost a month. My mother - died when I was very young, so my father had become - the whole world to me... After he left me, I had nobody. I was ten years old.
DR. LECTER: You're very frank, Clarice. I think - it would be quite something to know you in private life.
CLARICE: Quid pro quo, Doctor.
DR. LECTER: The significance of the moth is change. Caterpillar into cocoon into beauty... Billy wants to change, too, Clarice. But there's the problem of his size, you see. Even if he were a woman, he'd have to be a big one...
CLARICE: Dr. Lecter, there's no correlation in the literature between transsexualism and violence. Transsexuals are very passive.
DR. LECTER: Clever girl. You're so close to the way you're going to catch him - do you realize that?
CLARICE: No. Tell me why.
DR. LECTER: After your father's death, you were orphaned. What happened next? I don't imagine the answer's on those second-rate shoes, Clarice.
CLARICE: I went to live with my mother's cousin and her husband in Montana. They had a ranch.
DR. LECTER: A cattle ranch?
CLARICE: Horses - and sheep...
DR. LECTER: How long did you live there?
CLARICE: Two months.
DR. LECTER: Why so briefly?
CLARICE: I - ran away...
DR. LECTER: Why, Clarice? Did the rancher fuck you?
CLARICE: No.
DR. LECTER: Did he try to?
CLARICE: No...! Quid pro quo, Doctor.
DR. LECTER: Billy's not a real transsexual, but he thinks he is. He tries to be. He's tried to be a lot of things, I expect.
CLARICE: You said - I was very close to the way we'd catch him.
DR. LECTER: There are three major centers for transsexual surgery: Johns Hopkins, the University of Minnesota, and Columbus Medical center. I wouldn't be surprised if Billy has applied for sex reassignment at one or all of them, and been rejected.
CLARICE: On what basis would they reject him?
DR. LECTER: The personality inventories would trip him up. Rorschach, Wechsler, House-Tree-Person... He wouldn't test like a real transsexual.
CLARICE: How would he test?
DR. LECTER: That's enough, I think. Happy hunting. Oh, and Clarice - next time you will tell me why you ran away. Shall I summarize?
CLARICE: Yes, Doctor. Please.
