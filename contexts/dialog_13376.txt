SARAH: You know, I've been living here for almost three years. Now in three days it seems as if I know everybody. When I pass people on the street I want to stop and say, Listen
EDDIE: Thanks.
SARAH: Eddie, where do you go when you go out?
EDDIE: Museums... art galleries... concerts.
EDDIE: Well, I believe you when you say you go to school.
SARAH: You want to go with me?
EDDIE: What, are you kidding? See that book? I've been trying to get through that book ever since I first got here. I haven't finished the first chapter. Did you read all them books?
SARAH: Mm hmm.
EDDIE: You got it all in your head?
SARAH: When I'm sober. They get a little mixed up when I'm drunk. Most of the time they're mixed up.
EDDIE: Oh, stop talking about yourself like you're a lush or something. I don't like it. Maybe you ought to go to a clinic, get some treatments.
SARAH: I'm getting treatments right here.
EDDIE: I'm hungry.
SARAH: Take your choice. I've got enough so we won't have to go out of the house till Tuesday.
EDDIE: What did all this stuff cost you?
SARAH: When you've got money, you'll pay.
EDDIE: No, c'mon, I wanna know. I wanna keep score.
SARAH: The bills are right here. You didn't say what you wanted.
EDDIE: Don't you ever cook anything?
SARAH: Eggs. How do you like them?
EDDIE: Raw.
SARAH: Oh, cut my finger.
EDDIE: I've got something in my bag.
SARAH: Oh, it's not bad.
SARAH: Eddie, what's in that case?
EDDIE: Haven't you opened it?
SARAH: No, why should I? It's yours.
EDDIE: It's a machine gun. This guy told me when I came to the big city I'd have to have a machine gun, so I bought one. Where do you get the money? To pay for all this? I mean the liquor, and the groceries, and the rent?
SARAH: From a rich old man who used to be my lover.
