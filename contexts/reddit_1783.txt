Lehigh rejected me, then sent an apology letter and accepted me
I WAS SENT A REJECTION LETTER YESTERDAY. LEHIGH WAS MY EARLY DECISION AND OH BOY DID I BAWL MY EYES OUT. 

A FEW HOURS AGO THEY SENT AN APOLOGY LETTER THAT IT WAS A MISTAKE AND ACCEPTED ME. 

NOW I AM CRYING WITH TEARS OF JOYYYYY. 

STEVE HARVEY 2.0 

LEHIGH YOU SUNNUVABICH I LOVE YOU!!

Edit: I am thinking of deleting this post cuz I speculate the apology email was actually for the new acceptance letter. 
I have emailed Lehigh. 
Such an unprofessional behavior. I mean shame on you guys. Thank God I didn't withdraw my applications. 

Depauw and Drexel came thru with 40K worth of aid SO FUCK LEHIGH.
