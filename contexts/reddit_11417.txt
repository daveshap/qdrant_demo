My brother is always doing stuff to me that will make me upset and then keeps asking me why I get defensive!
I’m tired of him doing stuff to me and then will act like I’m not supposed to be upset about it. The moment I say something he’ll raise his voice and tell me that I’m being defensive and that I need to stop. He’s always constantly playing in my face and whenever I get upset about something he’ll try to make me seem like I’m the crazy one and will trip it to where he thinks I don’t make any sense and then he’ll act like he doesn’t understand what I’m saying. Even if I say something to him about being rude he’ll try to make it as if he wasn’t trying to be wrong and will make me look crazy for being upset. I’m also tired of him taking my emotions for a joke and using them to find reasons to mock me. Even if I get upset over that he says I’m being defensive. It’s like I’m not allow to express how I feel whenever somebody treats me badly. I don’t know why I feel like is target most of the time. I don’t know if he is doing it to try to gaslight me or not.
