BRIAN: Do you have to do that?
TIM: Could you believe that fire? Man! First day! There I was, Adcox and me, pullin' that lady right out of the fire's fuckin' throat! I love it here -- No surround and drown for this company. Fighting 17th! Goddamn Stephen's amazing. You see how he took that fire by the balls? I'm gonna be that good some day, you watch.
TIM: Y'know what Stephen said to me, right when all the shit was coming hard? You never know till the moment the fire stares you down if you're just gonna do this job or be great at it"."
BRIAN: Ah man, is he usin' that line now on you? What, you think he made that little gem up? Jesus Christ, I used to have to listen to my old man use that every morning.
