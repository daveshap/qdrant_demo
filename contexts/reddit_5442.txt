Is it okay to try applying to places even though I (20m) have no degree and still in college? Internship or some such?
My parents have been pushing me "to try doing more, instead of constantly doing jobs that don't have room for growth" for a long time. I always told them its just a job while i'm in college and saying "plus, its impossible to get a that type of job with no degree." Until I did more research and found that its not true.

I have many things that I might want to pursue in life. My parents are Asian but support any choice I make. I just want to know if it would be wrong to have the audacity to bother businesses with applying. Here are some things I was thinking (Fluff):

*-Vlogging because I want to travel the world. They like this idea the most because they've seen how much travelling is my passion. (This doesn't count... you don't apply to do this)*

*-Photography firm/studio. I love scenery and photography. I don't know much about Photoshop but I have taken a class in high school. I also love exploring places people don't really go and taking photos.*

*- Journalism firm - Definitely up there with vlogging. I can meet people, I can travel, I can go to where interesting things are happening (I know international journalist is dangerous but that entices me more), and I have a significant part in changing the world. I'm also pretty gifted in English, Communications, and Persuasion compared to math. I also love learning new languages.*

Anyways... back to the topic. Would it be out of line?

Thank you for your time and reading.
