MARY: That boy you brought in, he was shot, wasn't he?
FRANK: Yes.
MARY: He's dead, huh?
FRANK: Yes.
MARY: I think this place stinks.
FRANK: Our Lady of Misery.
MARY: Did you see my father?
FRANK: No.
MARY: It's crazy in there. What's wrong with that doctor? He keeps mumbling, poking himself in the eye when he talks to me.
FRANK: He's working a double shift.
MARY: Thing is, I'm supposed to be the fuckup. The one on the stretcher in there--that's supposed to be me. With my parents crying out here. I got a lot of guilt, you know what I mean?
MARY: My father's in a coma, now my mother's going crazy. It's like she's in a trance.
FRANK: She should go home.
MARY: I'd take her, but then who would stay here?
