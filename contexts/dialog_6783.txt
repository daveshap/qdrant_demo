JANI: They mean it.
JACK: Who's they?
JANI: My creditors. One night, around three in the morning, they'll come into the casino -
JACK: Forget it, Jani. It'll never work.
JANI: The point is, they want a man inside.
JACK: And I thought you were a bright woman.
JANI: Just listen. You don't have to do anything criminal.
JACK: Robbery's not criminal?
JANI: You don't have to be criminal. A man will come up to your table and deliberately cheat. You'll see him, stop him, and the guy will make a big scene. There'll be chaos. And that's when it'll happen.
JACK: You're serious.
JANI: You won't be committing a crime. The man will cheat, you'll just be doing your job, that's all.
JACK: And I thought you were only after my body.
JANI: I've come to know you. You're honest. I trust you.
JACK: What'll you do when it all goes wrong?
JANI: It won't.
JACK: But if it does.
JANI: You keep the ten thousand pounds.
JACK: What ten thousand pounds?
JANI: These people will pay you ten thousand before and ten thousand after. They want someone they can be sure of, an honest dealer. That's the point. Not all dealers are honest. Mr Reynolds will never suspect you.
JACK: Reynolds? You've done your research.
