KAY: ... He said he had shot his Grandfather with a gun, and then he died in the garden. And he asked me... he asked me, Tom, if that meant now his father would shoot him out of... revenge. How does a four year old boy learn the word... 'revenge'?
HAGEN: Kay... Kay...
KAY: What kind of a family is this... are we human beings? He knows his Father killed his Uncle Carlo. He heard Connie.
HAGEN: You don't know that's true. But Kay, just for the sake of an argument, let's assume it is, I'm not saying it is, remember, but... What if I gave you what might be some justification for what he did... or rather some possible justification for what he possibly did.
KAY: That's the first time I've seen the lawyer side of you, Tom. It's not your best side.
HAGEN: Okay, just hear me out. What if Carlo had been paid to help get Sonny killed? What if his beating of Connie that time was a deliberate plot to get Sonny out into the open? Then what? And what if the Don, a great man, couldn't bring himself to do what he had to do, avenge his son's death by killing his daughter's husband? What if that, finally, was too much for him, and he made Michael his successor, knowing that Michael would take that load off his shoulders, would take that guilt?
KAY: He's not the same as when I met him.
HAGEN: If he were, he'd be dead by now. You'd be a widow. You'd have no problem.
KAY: What the hell does that mean? Come on, Tom, speak out straight once in your life. I know Michael can't, but you're not Sicilian, you can tell a woman the truth; you can treat her like an equal, a fellow human being.
HAGEN: If you told Michael what I've told you today, I'm a dead man.
KAY: When is it finally over? I want it to be over before my baby is born.
HAGEN: I don't know. I hope soon; but it's not over yet, and that's why you and the kids have to come back to me.
