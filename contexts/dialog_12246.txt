UNCLE VICTOR: Good idea of yours to come out here, Harold. It's a lovely spot.
HAROLD: Thank you, Uncle.
UNCLE VICTOR: Call me sir
HAROLD: Yes, sir.
UNCLE VICTOR: Perfectly lovely. You know, this is what we're defending. Everything that's good and beautiful in the American way of life. Oh, there's some nut peace petitioner over there. Let's go off this way. Those crazy Commie bastards. I don't know why we tolerate 'em. Parasites.
