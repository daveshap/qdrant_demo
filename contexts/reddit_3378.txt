Anyone else find it insulting that lack of dating/sexual experience is seen as a "red flag" ?
What exactly makes dating or sexual inexperience a "red flag"? It says nothing about what kind of person you are and what kind of partner you would make. Calling inexperience a "red flag" just sounds like another way to say "if you don't abide by society's standards of what your dating life should look like then you're unattractive/weird/abnormal." I just dont get it lol.

Edit: Just to clarify this post for all the experienced people commenting. My post isn't about experienced people not wanting to date inexperienced people. It's about the stigma that comes with being inexperienced (ie. a "red flag").
