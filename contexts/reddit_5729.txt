My coworker got terminated today I feel awful for her
My coworker got let go today in the worst way possible. My boss left for the day as he personal things to attend to. He handed my other coworker  an envelope and said to give it to our part time coworker. At my lunch hour I wrote him with my concerns over her work product as I was her supervisor. I get an email about a half hour before the part time coworker was supposed to leave that today was her last day. My coworker was all giddy saying see you guys next week. Took the envelope from My other coworker than walked out the door. She opened the envelope in her car came back crying said she has been let go. It was heartbreaking but not a total surprise as she would only complete one task a day. She was balling when she came back to get her things. I just can’t stop thinking of my boss not even meeting with her and just giving her an envelope. What if she wouldn’t have opened it? I have a feeling that due to my boss not liking conflict he chose this way.  I have been on the receiving end of firing. It’s not pretty. Is it wrong of me to feel like I should start looking as the way with this is handled was not great?
