HOLDEN: I'm great. I mean, I know I'm not really great, but I feel just great. How you like my new suit?
DECKARD: Well, you don't have to worry about getting it wrinkled.
HOLDEN: Don't make me laugh. It makes me pee.
DECKARD: Sorry.
HOLDEN: Hey, it's okay. I like to pee. So how are you doing?
DECKARD: I'm doing okay.
HOLDEN: From what I hear you're doing great. Bryant tells me you're going like a god damn one-man army. Making a lot of money, huh?
DECKARD: Yeah. But that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
HOLDEN: Money?
DECKARD: No. I got a problem.
HOLDEN: Let's hear it.
DECKARD: I think I'm starting to empathize with these Nexus-sixes.
DECKARD: What's that?
HOLDEN: I'm taking a piss.
