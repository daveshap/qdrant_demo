Authoritative DNS server resolve also any other domain - Is that a risk? In my organization (huge financial institute) there are 4 ns servers that are defined by NS DNS record to be the authoritative DNS servers of all of our public websites.However, I found that those DNS server send responses also if they are queried about any other domain. I wonder whether there are security risks in this behaviour. References will be appreciated as well.
