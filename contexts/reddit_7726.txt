Post MA help?
I have my MA in English. I’ve been looking at schools for my doctorate. My first two choices didn’t really work out... but they both offered my PhD in English.....

My third choice accepted me, however, they don’t offer a PhD in English. I would be getting my doctorate in psychology with focus on cognition and instruction in secondary and post secondary settings... IE how to teach, as opposed to... what I’m teaching? 

My question, or rather dilemma, is that I  want to eventually teach at a university. (I’m a high school teacher now). 

If I get my doctorate in psychology with a focus on cognition and instruction, is that going to help or hinder me? 

Should I hold out for a PhD in English? Or will a PhD in English hinder me because I’m not “well-rounded”. 

Any help or insight will be greatly appreciated. 

I cross posted this into another subreddit.
