BRANDON: They'll know whether he killed himself.
BETTY: I don't.
BRANDON: How did you meet him?
BETTY: On a train. He said he lived here, and he offered to make a reservation for me.
BRANDON: Nice of him.
BETTY: He knew the immigration officer. He eased himself in.
BRANDON: He was a great boy for that. What else?
BETTY: That's all there is.
