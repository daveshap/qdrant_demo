Had a message from my boss that I should 'keep my options open'!
My boss messaged me earlier and I am worried that I am going to be without a job soon! I've only joined the company since the beginning of the year and I really like working there.

This is the message he sent.

"Morning - Sorry that HR haven't been in contact with you since the shutdown. You can appreciate that business has and is suffering as a result of the restrictions brought about by COVID virus. I understand from the owners of the business that cuts will he made and between you and me I would keep my options open. We are not back at work yet so by all means keep me posted of any further news. All the best."

What do you lot make of this? Should I be worried?
