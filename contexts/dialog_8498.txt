THERESA: Okay, look -- I think we got off on the wrong foot here --
ERIN: That's all you got, lady. Two wrong feet. In fucking ugly shoes.
ERIN: She insulted me!
ED: Bullshit. It was a misunderstanding. But instead of handling it politely, instead of treating her with respect --
ERIN: Why the fuck should I respect her?
ED: Because <u>that's how people treat each other</u>!
ERIN: Not in my world.
ED: Gee, I wonder why.
