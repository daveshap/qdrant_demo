JEANNE: I would like some fresh straw.
AULON: Louis... water and fresh straw!
JEANNE: And I would like to see a priest.
AULON: Now?
JEANNE: Yes. I didn't confess today.
AULON: Right. Raymond... a priest.
JEANNE: I shall also be needing a war horse -- mine is too slow -- and armor -- and a good sword -- and an artist to make me a banner.
AULON: Now?
JEANNE: Better today than tomorrow.
AULON: Well... uh -- this might take a little time -- but let me see what I can do.
JEANNE: I also need someone who can read and write.
AULON: This I can do. I was studying at the University of Paris -- till the English invaded it.
JEANNE: I thought you were an archer?
AULON: Yes, I am. I'm an archer who can read and write. Who do you want to write to?
JEANNE: The King of England. I want to give them the chance to leave Orleans in peace before I get there.
