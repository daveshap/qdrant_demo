The “Slow Fade”
This a vent- just want to put my feelings into words. Me and this women met on bumble back around Christmas time. Hit it off right off the bat and talked on the phone for 6 hours the day we met. At the time I thought this was to good to be true. We met 3 days later and the first date was amazing, never had a women look at me the way she did. Kept on telling me that she was so happy we met and the potential she saw in me, I felt the same. Not that I was in love, but if I ever had a “love at first site” moment in my life it was her. For the past 2 months we were seeing each other twice a week at it was great, it just felt right. Asked her if she wanted to date exclusively 5 days ago and since then I’ve been getting the slow fade. This shit sucks, I can’t stop thinking about the time we first met and the excitement and it makes me so sad. I’ll get over it, it will be old news soon but this one really hurt me bad. Thanks for whoever read. Just had to get it off my chest.
