Preemployment drug test for nicotine
Hello, I don't know if this is the correct page to ask this question but here goes.

After completing my interview on Friday I got a call today to fill out all the paperwork since I got the job. They then sent me an order for a drug test that needs to be completed in 24 hours, easy pass since I dont do drugs, but then I saw that they test for nicotine I guess because it's a hospital. I haven't smoked a cigarette in a month and have a prescription from my doctor for nicotine patches which I used as prescribed. 

If nicotine shows on my drug test will they not hire me even if I have a prescription for the patches?

Thank you for any advice.
