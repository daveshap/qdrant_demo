Can't find a part time job that doesn't require Saturdays...am a mother with no daycare that day. Any suggestions?
Does anyone know of any career path or something that wouldn't be retail that doesn't require Saturday hours? I literally have applied to so many jobs and most turn me down because of Saturdays. Any ideas anyone? I have 0 help, live in a state far away from my family, and have a sitter every day except tuesdays and saturdays. So frustraing lol
