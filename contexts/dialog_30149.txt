RABIN: Even if I was to let you talk to him, he won't talk to you. He's paranoid about being recorded and he knows the interrogation rooms are wired
KUJAN: This won't be an' interrogation, just a... friendly chat to kill time.
RAB IN: He won't go into the interrogation room.
KUJAN: Someplace else, then.
RAB IN: Where?
RABIN: No, no, no, no, no.
KUJAN: If it was a dope deal, where's the dope, if it was a hit, who called it in?
RABIN: And I am sure you have a host of wild + theories to answer these questions.
KUJAN: You know damn well what I think.
RABIN: That's crazy, Dave and it doesn't matter. He has total immunity and his story checks out. He doesn't know what you want to know.
KUJAN: I don't think he does. Not exactly, but there's a lot more to his story. I want to know why twenty-seven men died on that pier for what looks to be ninety-one million dollars worth of dope that wasn't there. Above all, I want to be sure that Dean Keaton is dead.
