TED: Elaine.
ELAINE: Ted. I don't know why you got on this flight. I don't know what you're trying to prove.
TED: Elaine, we have to go back.
ELAINE: We can't go back. We had something very special, but it's all over.
TED: Elaine, I mean the mission has to be aborted. This ship should never have passed FSA inspection. This thing is held together by string and chewing gum.
ELAINE: Ted, get a grip on yourself. You should never have left the hospital.
TED: Then you <u>do</u> think I'm insane.
ELAINE: I've never used the word insane, Ted.
TED: What word would you use, Elaine?
ELAINE: The word is sick. Ted -- very, very, very sick.
TED: What would you say if I told you the toilet just blew up in my face.
ELAINE: I'd use the word insane.
TED: There's something dangerously wrong with this ship, Elaine. I know its the wiring. That toilet's just the tip of the iceberg.
ELAINE: Ted, a toilet's not going to kill anyone.
STELLA: You've been hurt.
TED: I'm getting over it. If a relationship isn't working, you can't force it.
STELLA: No, I mean your head. Sit down. I'll take a look at it. I'm a nurse.
STELLA: Do you want to talk about it.
TED: I opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me.
STELLA: No. I mean your relationship.
TED: We were in love but I'm not sure I know what love is anymore.
STELLA: Love's the same as it always was. It's people who change.
TED: People change in relation to each other. Love changes on its own.
STELLA: Not if the people change together in relation to that love.
TED: Sure. But that's only when the love itself goes unchanged.
STELLA: Then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there's change in the two people who share that love.
TED: I just wish it was that simple. We really were in love. You know how it is when you laugh all the time.
STELLA: No. It's hard to L-A-U-G-H when your father's dying.
TED: Well, we laughed. We laughed all the time.
