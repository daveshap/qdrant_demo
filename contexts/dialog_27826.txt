NAZORINE: ...a fine boy from Sicily, captured by the American Army, and sent to New Jersey as a prisoner of war...
DON CORLEONE: Nazorine, my friend, tell me what I can do.
NAZORINE: Now that the war is over, Enzo, this boy is being repatriated to Italy. And you see, Godfather... He...my daughter...they...
DON CORLEONE: You want him to stay in this country.
NAZORINE: Godfather, you understand everything.
DON CORLEONE: Tom, what we need is an Act of Congress to allow Enzo to become a citizen.
NAZORINE: An Act of Congress!
