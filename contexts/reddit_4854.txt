Need advice for holding a job while depressed.
I'm looking for some advice from folks suffering through depression who are able to hold down a job. I seem to no longer be able to do so any more. The only work I can get in my area is call center work, which is such a terrible soul crushing job to do that once I add my depression on top of it, it never lasts long. I have been doing it on and off for the last 12 years and was able to hold on for around a year or two to six months at a time, but the last time I tried I made it one day before quitting. I just can't muster the fake sympathy and pretending to care about the callers issues anymore. But I need to work to live. I have tried shorter shifts, and even part time, but I always end up sitting outside before my shift starts unable to walk through the doors knowing what the next 8 hours are going to require of me.
