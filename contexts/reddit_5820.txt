Somewhat unrelated, but those of you who took a gap year before college to work and save up money, how did it go?
I just graduated high school and am trying to decide what step I want to take next. I'm currently enrolled in a university, but recently have been considering taking a gap year to work and save up some money. 

Those who have done this, what are your experiences? Do you regret your decision, or did it work out? Any advice is greatly appreciated.
