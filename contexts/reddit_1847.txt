Opinion: People are stupid to not apply to any schools between their safeties and the top schools in the nation
I see so many people here doing stuff like applying to only the absolute best schools and one safety (i.e. Oregon State) and then crying when they get rejected everywhere and have to go to "a school I didn't even have to try to get into"

Or they shotgun to only Ivies with no safeties at all and start crying when they have to go to community college.

I don't get it, there are so many schools between these options that are still very very good schools but apparently some people don't even bother. Is it because other schools don't offer financial support or something?
