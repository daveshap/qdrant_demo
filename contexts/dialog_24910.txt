SHEILA: Why did you come back?
THEO: When I'm with you Sheila, I don't even think about bowling. Theo takes Sheila in his arms and kisses her passionately. She stops him and looks around nervously.
SHEILA: If Junior finds us, he'll kill us both.
THEO: I killed him once, I'll just have to kill him again.
SHEILA: You don't get two chances with Junior.
THEO: At least I'll die smiling.
