Why are people acting like it's always irrational when somebody wants to die?
I have no friends, no social (or any) skills, no job or any normal basic experiences. I don't fit in anywhere and I can't function in society. It makes sense in my situation that I want to die. I believe almost everyone would feel the same if they eyperienced the same things. I don't feel human anymore. Objectively it would be better if I didn't exist. I just keep suffering and it's exhausting and tiring.
