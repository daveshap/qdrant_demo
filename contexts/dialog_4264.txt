DULANEY: You lied to me!
REBECCA: What?
DULANEY: I just left Joanne Braslow. She told me she saw you doing cocaine at Marsh's house!
REBECCA: She's mistaken.
DULANEY: That's not good enough, Goddamit!
REBECCA: It isn't true. You have to believe me.
DULANEY: No, I don't have to believe you. The jury has to believe you and answers like he's lying or she's mistaken aren't going to convince them.
REBECCA: I don't use cocaine anymore. If she says she saw me doing it she's lying.
DULANEY: Why would she lie?
REBECCA: I don't know, Frank -- but don't you think that's something we should find out?
DULANEY: Michael -- get off the phone.
MICHAEL: Why?
DULANEY: Because I'm expecting a call.
MICHAEL: -- But it's Sunday.
DULANEY: I know what day it is! Get off the phone.
MICHAEL: I gotta go. I'll call you later.
