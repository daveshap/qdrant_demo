Reminder: don't ask "what are we?" Instead, say, "this is what we are. This is what I want us to be. How do you feel about it?" Open and honest communication is key.
The title says it all. This applies to those who want to be in a relationship. 

I hope you take the power into your own hands instead of giving it away to people who may not deserve your time, energy, and effort. 

Cheers.
