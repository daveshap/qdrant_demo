I Looked
I wanted to send a twitter reply to a food trailer today to say thank you and their suggested item was delicious.  Low and behold your name pops up in my feed.  But I'm not following you and you're feed is protected.  You must have unprotected it and it shows up in my list still, which is weird.  (Good job Tweetdeck, lists of people you don't follow and don't follow you?)

So, no big deal.  I've been okay lately.  I miss some of the links you post about news and the cartoons you drew so I start poking around.

And that's when I see the Tumblr post to him saying you could just spend hours staring at his face.

3 months ago you were saying the same things to me.  Why did I have to look?  I feel like Pipen.  Why do I always have to look?

So, that's the closure I needed.  It sucks, my day is shot now, but I think it'll be easier for me.  I'd been holding onto something and now I know I was holding onto the past and it's time to look forward to what else is waiting for me.

Still doesn't take the hurt away, but it's something.
