SARTORIUS: You have to give me your word you won't come in. Then I'll come out.
KELVIN: All right.
KELVIN: What happened to Gibarian?
SARTORIUS: Didn't you talk to Snow?
KELVIN: I want to hear your version.
SARTORIUS: Who, here, could possibly care what you want? At best, you're Employee of the Month for the highest bidder in the Solaris auction. They have no idea what's going on up here. They've never even been in space. And I'm supposed to listen to you?
KELVIN: I am here to recover this mission, report my findings, and make a recommendation. Now: What happened to him?
SARTORIUS: The same thing that could happen to any of us.
KELVIN: Where's his body?
SARTORIUS: In the lab. With her, probably.
KELVIN: Her? Who are you talking about?
