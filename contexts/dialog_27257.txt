MULDER: Why are you whispering?
SCULLY: I can't really talk right now.
MULDER: What did you find?
SCULLY: Evidence of a massive infection.
MULDER: What kind of infection?
SCULLY: I don't know.
MULDER: Scully -- listen to me. I'm going home, then I'm booking a flight to Dallas. I'm getting you a ticket, too.
SCULLY: Mulder --
MULDER: I need you there with me. I need your expertise on this. The bomb we found was meant to destroy those bodies and whatever they were infected by.
SCULLY: I've got a hearing tomorrow --
MULDER: -- I'll have you back for it, Scully. Maybe with evidence that could blow that meeting away.
SCULLY: Mulder -- I can't -- I'm already way past the point of common sense here --
