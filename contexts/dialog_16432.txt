JENNIFER: Have we met before?
HARRY: No.
JENNIFER: Only I forget. They give me pills, you know, to keep me... even... and... I forget things,
HARRY: Well, you didn't forget me. I just came because I wanted to know if you knew a man called Butterfield.
JENNIFER: Maybe... I... don't...
HARRY: What about Philip Swann?
JENNIFER: I knew Swann. He's a fucking liar.
HARRY: Why's that?
JENNIFER: He said he knew how to protect us. But he didn't know anything. He made us think it was over and done with.
HARRY: What is?
JENNIFER: I don't want to think about it. If I think about it he'll hear me. He'll find me.
HARRY: Swann?
