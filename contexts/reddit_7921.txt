Computer-based transcriptions: too good to be true?
I am looking into options for transcribing and hopefully translating audio-recorded interviews. I was initially considering hiring someone but then learned about an alleged industry of computer-based transcription services.

I am wondering if this is too good to be true because the quoted costs are significantly lower than hiring a person.

Do any social scientists or other scholars have any experience with companies like Happy Scribe or their competitors? 

There are 2 languages in my interviews. Some are exclusively English, some are exclusively Tagalog and some are a mix of the 2 languages.

But I am still interested in English only services because maybe 40% of my interviews are exclusively English. If the service is real and still affordable with an option of English only, that means I could find an individual to help me with the remaining 60% that are in Tagalog. 

I had a translator for some of the interviews but their English is shaky. I got to the point where I was conducting interviews in Tagalog myself but that is after I memorized the questions and also groped my way through asking definitions of specific words as the interview unfolded. The point is, I will eventually need someone or some service to translate from Tagalog to English.

Any thoughts would be appreciated.
