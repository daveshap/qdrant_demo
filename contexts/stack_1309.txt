How many subpanel breakers can a single piece of main breaker/bus support? This is my main panel cabinet.My original plan was to put the subpanel in front of main panel inside the cabinet by just letting it stand naturally (because it would be distracting or not good to the look to connect it to the wall outside the cabinet). For those who have tried this. What problems have you encountered? This is why I need to limit the Siemens sub load center to 12 space 18\" height so I can still access the main panel.Rest is original message:This is my main panel with 16 2-pole breakers US style. All use GE (General Electric) plug-in breakers.The breaker on top is a 125A 2-pole. Are all 125A breakers really that big?I'm replacing six of the original GE 2-pole breakers with six Siemens GFCI 2-pole breakers. Since I can't directly plug the 6 pcs due to bus nub mismatch. I need to use a subpanel. Now my question:My 6 pcs of Siemens 2-pole GFCI breakers are rated at 60A 2 pcs, 30A, 4 pcs.Can I connect them or the 6 branch subpanel to just one of the main breaker output say rated at 70A or even 100A? In a panel, How many ampere can a breaker bus support provided the whole panel is rated at 100A.. is a single breaker bus also 100A? If not, what is the rule of the connections generally?I can't replace the entire panel because it's difficult to get it out of the concrete wall and put another one fit right for it.What's the usual way to add subpanel? What did you do?
