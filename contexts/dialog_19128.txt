KENNY: Mom?
MOTHER: I've been so worried, dear. where are you?
KENNY: Nashville.
MOTHER: Oh... Well.
KENNY: The car broke down.
MOTHER: Oh, well, I knew that before you- even left. I told you, 'Kenny, that old Nash won't make it down the road.' But you had to go.
KENNY: Well, I got to Nashville. That's pretty far.
MOTHER: Next you'll be sick.
KENNY: I feel really good.
MOTHER: How are you going to pay when you get sick?
KENNY: I'm in a rooming house with Mr. Green.
MOTHER: Green? Not Owen Green. Owen Green embezzled money from your grandfather
KENNY: I don't know his first name.
MOTHER: Bet the sheets are grey.
KENNY: No. No, they're white. He's got a nice dog.
MOTHER: Worst time at year for dogs is when they get fungus.
KENNY: Fungus?
MOTHER: He doesn1t have fungus, does he?
KENNY: I don't think so.
MOTHER: Well, you'll get it, skin as sensitive as yours.
KENNY: How do you know if they do?
MOTHER: Weather's been awful. All those bombs dropping. It changes our weather. Sure not like the good old days.
KENNY: Does their hair fall out?
MOTHER: Your hair fell out? Just like your father. Weak hair.
KENNY: Listen. Maybe I should go...
MOTHER: I've been a Little dyspeptic.
KENNY: I want to get the dog off my bed.
MOTHER: But, I'll take some of that Nyquil... you know it puts you right to sleep no matter what's wrong, you go right off...
KENNY: Okay. I'll be talking to you.
MOTHER: Keep warm, dear. Let me hear from you.
KENNY: Bye.
MOTHER: Bye.
