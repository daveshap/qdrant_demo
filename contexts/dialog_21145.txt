KILLAINE: That's what I like about cocktail parties. Everyone is so perfectly natural.
BRANDON: How's life treating you?
KILLAINE: The usual grind.
BRANDON: Round of golf Saturday?
KILLAINE: If I can get off.
MITCHELL: Betty, this is Margo West. She wants to meet you. Miss Mayfield.
BETTY: How do you do?
MARGO: You're very attractive, my dear. And you look very unsophisticated.
MITCHELL: Unsophisticated? If I knew about this babe...
BETTY: I think I'd like to dance.
MITCHELL: Why certainly, baby.
BETTY: Please be a little more careful how you talk, Mr. Mitchell.
MITCHELL: How careful should I be?
BETTY: I don't like being referred to as babe, or addressed as baby. I don't like your possessive attitude, nor your hints of secret knowledge. In fact, to be very frank, Mr. Mitchell, I don't think I like you.
MITCHELL: Maybe you're going to have to like me.
