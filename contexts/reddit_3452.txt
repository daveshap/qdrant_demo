Mortified. But, he handled it like a sport.
So, I’ve been looking forward to a date that happened a few hours ago and I’m typing this wide awake because I’m embarrassed and mortified. I really like this guy and wanted tonight to go over smoothly. But the catch... after we had slept together, as I was getting dressed, there was a towel on the bed that wasn’t there and saw a smudge of red on my pants I was about to put on. I put two and two together and realized I had my period and had ruined his sheets. He was sweet enough to try to conceal the spot under the towel. I had quietly remarked “I think I ruined your sheets” and he said “oh, are there other spots on the bed?” casually and continued to say “don’t worry about it, it’ll wash right out”. I offered to buy him a set of new sheets and he again told me not to worry and jokingly “it adds color to the room”... I mean, I’m still pretty mortified it happened and will probably buy him sheets anyway but he handled it so well. Thankful there are guys out there that know what to do in these situations.

EDIT: Detail

UPDATE: 3rd date on Sunday! Invited to treat him out to my favourite Korean Chicken place in town. Plus, just enough time to let this period make its way out the door lol
