I was laid off by a company actively committing fraud. Should I pull the trigger?
A little background: I worked for a company who’s marketing department consisted of just me and a marketing director. In the short time I was there the marketing director proudly showed me that she was able to bring in extra funds by forging documents to send to vendors. You see, various vendors would work with us to create marketing campaigns and would reimburse us in full at the end. She discovered that if she created fake invoices (from REAL companies!) that she could get reimbursed, plus reel in a couple extra thousand. I immediately questioned the ethics of this approach to which she assured me “everyone does it. It’s implied.”

The marketing director soured on me seemingly overnight and picked apart my work until it was enough to make a case to have the owners fire me.

I’m in a position where I could report them to the vendors and sink that ship. I’m imagining a scenario where I could then tell recruiters I was let go because of my ethical stance, instead of “performance issues.” On the other hand, whistleblowers are never viewed in a positive light and the company would absolutely know it was me that narc’d, including some good friends and strong references still at the company.
