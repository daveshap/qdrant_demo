JESSICA: What's happened?... Why did it leave?
PAUL: Someone started another thumper.... We're not alone.
JESSICA: Man-carved steps.
PAUL: Yes...
STILGAR: Perhaps these are the ones Mapes told us of.
STILGAR: Are you trained in the ways of the desert?
JESSICA: No, but many consider my training valuable.
STILGAR: I will take the boy-man... he shall have sanctuary in my tribe... -- A LOW NOTE on a dip stick is blown by one of the Fremen tribe. Jessica shifts, Paul sees it, and just as Stilgar begins a reach for his weapon, Jessica turns, slashes out, utters a SOUND, whirls again and with rock behind her holds Stilgar helpless in front of her -- her hand at his throat. Paul moves on her first move. He races up a rocky incline.
STILGAR: Stop! Get back!! She has the weirding way. Why didn't you tell us! Great gods... if you can do this to the strongest of us you're worth ten times your weight of water. As a leader of my people I give you my bond: teach us this weirding way and you both shall have sanctuary. Your water shall mingle with our water.
JESSICA: Then I will teach you our way of battle.... you have the word bond of a Bene Gesserit.
