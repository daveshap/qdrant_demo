Stop ghosting people and have OPEN COMMUNICATION
Let’s stop ghosting people and try normalizing better and open communication!

1. If you lose interest in someone, tell them.
2. If you’re not looking for a relationship and you know the other person is, tell the person you’re seeing.
3. If you’ve gone on a date with someone and you didn’t feel the connection, tell them.
4. If you’ve gone on several dates with someone and don’t see a future with them, tell the person you’re seeing!
5. If you changed your mind on going on a date, tell them AS SOON AS YOU CHANGED YOUR MIND. 
6. If you’re not good at texting/ DMs, tell the person you’re talking to. They’re going to think you don’t like them. 
7. If you have a different communication style, tell the person you’re talking to. 
8. If you’re seeing several people at the same time and the other person has told you they want to be exclusive, tell them if you don’t want to be exclusive. Don’t string them along. 
9. If you’re looking for hookups, make that clear to the person you’re talking to. 

Some conversations may be difficult to hve but it’s better to be open and honest than to ghost someone or string them along. Please respect everyone you’re talking and interacting with instead of leading them on. It would be much appreciated!
