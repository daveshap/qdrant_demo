SORAN: Oh, I forgot to tell you. While you were unconscious, I injected a nano-probe into your bloodstream. It's been navigating your cardiovascular system, and right now I've attached it to your left ventricle. A little trick I picked up from the Borg.
LA FORGE: Yeah, they're full of great ideas.
SORAN: I just stopped your heart for five seconds. It felt like an eternity, didn't it? Did you know that you can stop the human heart for up to ten minutes before the onset of brain damage?
LA FORGE: No, I didn't know that.
SORAN: We learn something new about ourselves every day. Now. Maybe I didn't make myself clear. It is very important that you tell me exactly what Captain Picard knows.
LA FORGE: I told you everything. You might as well just kill me right now.
