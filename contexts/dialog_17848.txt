MAX: And what do you do when you in the catacombs?
BELL: The catacoombs? Whaddya want, a door? There's miles of em like a sewer system but they got to come up someplace in Istanbul.
MAX: You gotta be fucking crazy! You got stabbed in the ass once too much, sweetheart, cause you're gonna end up in Section 13, that's what - not the 'catacombs.
BILLY: Section 13?
MAX: Yeah, for the criminally insane. I was there once for two weeks and it ain't an illusion. It's awful. Namidou runs it like a death camp, that's where he spends most of his time...
BILLY: Where is it?
MAX: I don' t know. It's someplace down in there.... ..deep.. A big door...a wheel....
BELL: Hey, you know what's gonna get us out of here? It's not a map, Max. It's our balls. You know what I mean... ...I gotta get laid man, I don't know 'bout you guys, but if I don't get it on soon, I'm... I'm not gonna make it.
MAX: Shit.
BELL: Billy?
