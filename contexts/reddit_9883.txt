Job search with no SA experience
Hello all.

I'm graduating in may with an interdisciplinary MS in Counseling (3/4) and student affairs (1/4). I have the ultimate goal of Dean of Students at a mid-to-large university. The only pathways I've heard for DoS would be through ResLife, Student activities, Multicultural affairs, or conduct. I'm fine with, and am interested in, all of these FAs, but I have ZERO direct experience in all of these (except for conduct, where I've had a practicum this semester with limited hands on experience).

How am I going to break into the field? What sort of jobs should I be looking for? I hate the idea that I will have to work as an admin assistant for a year or longer just to get the experience I supposedly need to get a job that would make use of (and pay appropriately for) my MS.

Anyway, thanks for any and all advice.
