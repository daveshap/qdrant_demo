HOOKER: I, ah...thought you might wanna come out for a while. Maybe have a drink or somethin'.
LORETTA: You move right along, don't ya.
HOOKER: I don't mean nothin' by it. I just don't know many regular girls, that's all.
LORETTA: And you expect me to come over, just like that.
HOOKER: If I expected somethin', I wouldn't be still standin' out here in the hall.
LORETTA: I don't even know you.
HOOKER: You know me. I'm just like you... It's two in the morning and I don't know nobody.
