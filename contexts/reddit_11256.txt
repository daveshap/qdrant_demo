I don't know what happened
Lately, I have been thinking about something that when down in my early childhood. I was maybe 4 or 5.  One of my father's friends got close to me.  I mean we were close.  He treated me very kindly according to all the memories I have of him. But, thinking about the situation as an adult, it seems very questionable.  He was in his mid-20's.  He gave me a wedding ring and a puppy, then lift my life forever. 

The ring wasn't just some cheap trash.  It was his wedding ring.  After giving it to me,  my mother took it and combined it with two of hers to make a third.  If it weren't for this, I would have completely blocked him out of my memory. 

The night he gave me the ring, we were sitting in his truck in the woods.  At night! A four year old and a twenty something divorced man. I remember it being so dark that I couldn't see his face.  

This is the memory that came back to me.  I then thought, "Who was that man?" The first person I asked out laud was my mother.  She had NO memory of him.  She had never meet him. It took hours for the sister that is just a few years older than me to pop the name out.  

I also remember playing around with him in his home with no one else there.  

This memories just seem very questionable.  Looking back at my life, he had an impact on my development either positively or negatively. 

As a child, I was always very unhappy.   At a very early age, I started thinking about suicide.  This was about the age of 8-ish. I became overly hard on myself.  It felted as though I would not be able to improve my situation.  The world around me seemed as though it were a game I wasn't meant to play. I retreated for social situations whenever possible. My farther had a very absent method of parenting.
