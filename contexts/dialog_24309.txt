BILL: Was always curious why you... married Grant in the first place... Just never seemed outta love.
STARLA: I know what people say, Bill. I... Remember, back in high school I worked at my father's gas station?
STARLA: Grant used to get filled up every day. I knew it was just to see me. He was too old -- But he was handsome. And he had that big ol' Lincoln then. I flirted with him.
BILL: Well, big ol' Lincoln, sure. Guess I would have flirted with him too.
STARLA: My father, he was -- he was real close to evil. People didn't know. Still don't. From the time I was a toddler he'd beat the hell out of me. I don't mean just like a smack for smart--mouthing... he took a real enjoyment in it. And when I turned eleven or twelve, things... well, they got worse. Starla looks at Bill, who seems struck.
BILL: When you wanted to run away, I called your dad.
STARLA: That wasn't a good night, no.
BILL: I'm sorry.
