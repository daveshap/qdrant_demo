BUTCH: Not that I recall. What do you want us to do about it?
GILLETTE: Let's see... Let's suppose he gets to Customs and he gets caught. We get our money back, but then we have to deal with a criminal investigation. I don't much like that idea. Then again, let's suppose he actually gets through Customs. Now, that'll be something. We recover the money in cash and let the insurance cover the corporate fraud. We double our money.
BUTCH: So we go to the bar.
GILLETTE: I think so. The airport's going to be crawling with police. Traffic will be a nightmare. Go down to the bar. If they pull it off, great. Have someone deal with Ashby.
BUTCH: We'll take care of it.
GILLETTE: And how much did you say you wanted for this... What did you call it? A finder's fee?
