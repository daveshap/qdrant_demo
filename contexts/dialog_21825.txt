MOTHER: Why shouldn't she go out and have boyfriends?
DADDY: No reason at all, darlin'.
MOTHER: Well, I wish you'd stop criticizing and picking on her.
DADDY: Forgive my crudity, darlin'. All I'm saying is that a girl who would wear clothes like that is going to get in trouble sooner or later.
MOTHER: Well, time will tell, won't it?
DADDY: Yes, darlin', time will tell.
MOTHER: Rose, that scruffy-looking man is out in the yard again.
ROSE: Mrs. Hillyer, I don't know who he is, I really don't.
MOTHER: I had better call Daddy.
