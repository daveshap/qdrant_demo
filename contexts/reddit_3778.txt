I held hands with someone for the first time in my life today!
I know this isn’t a big deal to most people, but at age 18 it felt like it was a long time coming. I feel like most people my age that I know held hands with someone back in middle school or early on in high school, so I definitely feel like a major late bloomer. 100% worth the wait; it just has a special feeling that a lot of the things considered more “romantic” don’t have. 

Didn’t have anyone to tell without sounding like a hormone-filled 13 year old so I’m here now :)
