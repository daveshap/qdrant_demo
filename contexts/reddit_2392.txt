How do I get over my deep-seated dislike of working?
I’m in my early 20’s. I’ve just gotten a new job that I really want to do well at, but this disdain for work is deeply affecting my work and my enthusiasm for the role. I’ve worked part-time jobs and they weren’t so bad, but something about every 9-5 office job just feels like signing up for your own death. Like this desk, or another one, will be where I sit till I die. 

I resent it so much. I resent that our society is built this way, I resent that I have to spend my days doing this when I don’t enjoy it, I resent that lucky people like Kylie Jenner can sit at their gorgeous pools in the sun and play on their phones all day. 

I know I sound childish. I know this is just how it is. I’ve literally paid for school with the intent of having an office job. What do I do? How do I stop thinking this way and just accept that this is life? How do I start feeling enthusiasm and excitement for this role, especially now that I’ve just started at a new office? (I’m working remotely for now, but still). 

I would sincerely appreciate any advice. I’m scared this feeling could ruin my life. It’s been consistent with every office job I’ve ever worked. 

If this is the wrong subreddit, I’ll move the post. But I’ve always liked the advice given here. Thank you.
