BRANDON: Nice friendly approach you've got. Goble. I could hardly walk when I got out of bed this morning.
GOBLE: You asked for it.
BRANDON: I'm still asking. What do you want?
GOBLE: I'm not sure I want anything from you. You might want something from me.
BRANDON: Name it.
GOBLE: Information--protection--you might even want to hire me to go home and listen to the radio. That's the funny part of my business-- once in a while, I get hired not to work. Nice girl you were with last night. Known her long?
BRANDON: Private eye?
GOBLE: You guessed it. The card's phony. I got plenty of 'em. Different names, different jobs. I work out of San Francisco. Go anywhere, do anything. All it takes is the folding.
BRANDON: What are your rates?
GOBLE: $40 a day and expenses. Expenses run pretty high on a case like this. I'm a long way from home. I don't have a B.C. Licence. I'd need about $500 for a retainer.
BRANDON: What have you got on Miss Mayfield?
GOBLE: Mayfield? Oh, that girl you were with last night. You haven't hired me yet. Mr. Brandon.
BRANDON: That's a nice hard knee you've got, Goble. How'd you like to trade it for a broken neck?
GOBLE: Quit trying to scare me, Mr. Brandon, I'm neurotic.
BRANDON: I don't know whether to knock your teeth down your throat--or call the police--or just give you twenty bucks to go out and buy yourself a clean nose.
GOBLE: You hurt my feelings. I ought to raise the price to be a thousand.
BRANDON: If I call the police, your price will go down to a minus sign.
GOBLE: Bluff. You've waited too long.
BRANDON: For five hundred, what do I get?
GOBLE: I go home and paint the kitchen.
BRANDON: For two hundred?
GOBLE: I stick around and wait for the five hundred.
BRANDON: You mentioned information.
GOBLE: Sorry. Another client paid for that. You can hire me not to use it.
BRANDON: A thousand.
GOBLE: Got it on you?
BRANDON: Got the information on you?
GOBLE: Get it in half an hour.
BRANDON: There's two hundred. I'll meet you in an hour--where we met last night
GOBLE: Why not here?
BRANDON: I don't like your perfume in my office. Make it somewhere else if you don't like Charlie's.
GOBLE: Charlie's suits me fine. I don't scare.
