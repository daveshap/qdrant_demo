How to approach a recruiter with a proposal for a role I could fill?
Hello all - I'm considering a job change. I know of a company where I could bring my skills to do something new for them that they aren't currently doing. I'm not applying for an existing job posting or anything, I'm bringing a proposal for a way I could help them expand their business.

Would it be appropriate to reach out to their recruiter for something like this?
