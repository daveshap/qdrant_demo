It honestly feels like people hate me on first sight
Doesn’t matter if it’s in person or online where I’m nothing but a username. I’m actually feeling like I’m insane and that I’ve done some heinous cat against society that I’ve just forgotten and that’s why people don’t like me. Even if it’s a first impression, before I’ve said literally anything, I am instantly disliked.

To be honest though, I would fucking hate myself too for no reason. If they got to know me they would only hate me 100x more
