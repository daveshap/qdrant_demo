Only staying alive for others at this point
My mother is everything to me, if I was to kill myself it would destroy her. She lost her husband last year and I'm basically the only thing she lives for now. 

I'm basically a failure at life, I'm 24 years old, only ever had 2 temporary jobs. Never had a girlfriend. I have some friends but none of them would consider me as their best friend, even though I consider them as mine. 

In society, my family are seen as outcasts and people act as if we are beneath them. I feel like a failure to my mother when she's speaking to somebody in public as I've achieved nothing in my lifetime. 

These thoughts enter my head daily, I want a way out but I couldn't do it to my family. If there's ever a purpose for my death or a situation where I may need to die in place of someone else, I'm taking it.
