I made $11k last year.
That is about $2k more than 2017. It was ***rough*** to say the very least, but I still accomplished a lot. I carried a 4.0 GPA in school all year, and I managed to move across the country to a place that is much sunnier. Not experiencing seasonal depression has completely changed my life. I ate a lot of canned fish, plain rice, and oh so many bananas, but most importantly, I managed to survive. I'm happy I made it through. This sub has always been a place that made me feel less alone, and I am grateful for this community.

Cheers to a new year, friends!

edit: my first silver! y'all are a wild bunch. thanks again for being one of the best communities on reddit.
