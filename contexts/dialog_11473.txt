GRUSINSKAYA: The stage frays one's nerves... the discipline -- it's so exacting. Discipline means doing what you don't want to do and take no pleasure in doing. Do you know what I mean? Have you ever experienced the weariness that comes from discipline?
BARON: I? -- Oh, no. I do only what I take pleasure in doing.
GRUSINSKAYA: I see -- you do only what you take pleasure in doing. You take pleasure in coming into a woman's bedroom and you come. You take pleasure in a dangerous climb onto a balcony, so you do it... And what is your pleasure now?
BARON: I should like to smoke.
GRUSINSKAYA: Why do you smile?
BARON: Because I can see something in the mirror that you cannot. My dear --
GRUSINSKAYA: What can you see?
BARON: You are beautiful!
GRUSINSKAYA: No.
BARON: Beautiful but so sad. I did not know it was so dangerous to look into a woman's bedroom.
