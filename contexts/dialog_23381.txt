GREGORY: I'm sorry. I didn't intend to treat you like a child.
MARY: But you have treated me that way.
GREGORY: I won't do it again. We're friends. I'll never order you about again.
GREGORY: However, I won't say that I'll not take charge occasionally, and I'm going to take charge new. I've a job for you.
MARY: A job?
GREGORY: You told me you were pretty good with youngsters. Today I bumped into an old friend of mine, Mrs. Wheeler She runs a settlement house down in the Village and is looking for a kindergarten teacher.
MARY: I'd like that.
GREGORY: It's not much money, but it's enough to live on. You'd have to move out of that hotel and into a furnished room.
MARY: Maybe the Romaris might have a room. They seem nice.
GREGORY: The people at the restaurant?
MARY: Yes.
