KIRK: Lieutenant, are you wearing your hair differently?
SAAVIK: It is still regulation, Admiral.
SAAVIK: May I speak, sir?
KIRK: Lieutenant, self-expression does not seem to be one of your problems.
SAAVIK: I wish to thank you for the high efficiency rating.
KIRK: You earned it.
SAAVIK: I did not think so.
KIRK: You're bothered by your performance on the <u>Kobayashi Maru</u>.
SAAVIK: I failed to resolve the situation.
KIRK: There is no correct resolution. It is a test of character.
SAAVIK: May I ask how <u>you</u> dealt with the test?
KIRK: You may ask, Lieutenant.
KIRK: That was a little joke.
SAAVIK: Humor... that is a difficult concept ... it is not logical...
KIRK: We learn by doing, Lieutenant.
