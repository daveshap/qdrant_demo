ALLISON: -- But he does seem very nice.
SUSAN: You think so?
QUINCE: ...I read you all the way on the Bontecou thing, and I know where you're coming from. And I'm with you a hundred and one percent.
PARRISH: Thank you, Quince.
QUINCE: But I've got to tell you, if mergers are in the wild, I've got some great prospects I've developed. I want to talk to you about them next week.
PARRISH: Next week?
QUINCE: Yeah. Or the week after.
PARRISH: No, anything is possible. It's up to Joe.
QUINCE: Joe, you don't know how glad I am you're aboard. Anybody who can take some of the weight off the old man, I'm in his corner.
JOE: That's very gracious of you, Quince.
QUINCE: No problem. I'll leave you two alone. I can tell you guys have something on the fire --
ALLISON: Did you know twenty-six members of your rifle company are coming?
PARRISH: Who?
ALLISON: From the Korean War.
PARRISH: Conflict, honey. Korean Conflict.
ALLISON: Whatever it was, they'll be here. We sent out invitations to everyone, plane tickets included -- the RSVP's are amazing. A few of them we didn't hear from, and some of them are dead, of course --
PARRISH: Of course.
ALLISON: You know, we're going to give this party for you whether you like it or not.
PARRISH: I like it. I like it. I'm sorry I don't seem more appreciative.
ALLISON: That's okay, Daddy.
QUINCE: ...I know you're down, but you know when you're down, Drew, there's no place to go but up.
DREW: Thanks, Quince.
QUINCE: Never mind Bontecou. I've got some other merger possibilities up my sleeve, and I'm putting them to see old man.
DREW: Are you?
QUINCE: We'll do it together. I'll clue you in. Timing's got to be right. The old man says it's up to Joe.
DREW: 'It's up to Joe'? Those were his words?
QUINCE: Yeah.
DREW: 'It's up to Joe', huh?
QUINCE: Yeah, that's what he said.
DREW: Well, that's very interesting.
QUINCE: I thought so, too. Joe's a neat guy.
DREW: Yeah. Neat.
JOE: I wanted to apologize, Susan --
SUSAN: I thought you said 'Be sorry for nothing'.
JOE: Well, now I am sorry. For intruding on you this afternoon.
SUSAN: It wasn't an intrusion. And if it was, it turned out to be welcome.
JOE: I appreciate you --
SUSAN: Excuse me?
JOE: I mean I appreciate that.
SUSAN: And I appreciate you, too.
