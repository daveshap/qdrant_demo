By popular demand, we have relaunched /r/NeutralNews!
[Recent events](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4ny59k/lets_talk_about_orlando/) have generated considerable demand for alternatives to /r/news.

A couple years ago, the mod team here at /r/NeutralPolitics attempted to start such a subreddit, but it didn't take hold, so we shut it down. Today, we're trying again.

The goal of /r/NeutralNews is to provide a space to discuss events of the day in a respectful and evidence-based way. All points of view are welcome, but assuming good faith and being decent to one another is a must.

The key to any news subreddit is a constant flow of submissions. Without a critical mass of contributors, we'll run into the same problem as before, so if you're reading this, please go subscribe to /r/NeutralNews and start submitting links.
