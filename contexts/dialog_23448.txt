CYNTHIA: He just asked me questions.
ANN: What kinds of questions?
CYNTHIA: Questions about sex.
ANN: Well, like what did he ask, exactly?
CYNTHIA: Well, like, I don't want to tell you, exactly.
ANN: Oh, so you'll let a total stranger record your sexual life on tape, but you won't tell your own sister?
CYNTHIA: Apparently.
ANN: Did he ask you to take your clothes off?
CYTNHIA: Did he ask me to take my clothes off? No, he didn't.
ANN: Did you take your clothes off?
CYNTHIA: Yes, I did.
ANN: Cynthia!
CYNTHIA: What!?
ANN: Why did you do that?
CYNTHIA: Because I wanted to.
ANN: But why did you want to?
CYNTHIA: I wanted him to see me.
ANN: Cynthia, who knows where that tape may end up? He could be... bouncing it off some satellite or something. Some horny old men in South America or something could be watching it.
CYNTHIA: He wouldn't do that.
ANN: You don't know that for sure.
CYNTHIA: Well, it's too late now, isn't it?
ANN: Did he touch you?
CYNTHIA: No, but I did.
ANN: You touched him?
CYTNHIA: No, I touched me.
ANN: Wait a minute. Do you mean... don't tell me you... in front of him.
CYNTHIA: In front of him, Ann, yes.
ANN: You are in trouble.
CYNTHIA: Listen to you!! You sound like Mom. What are you talking about?
ANN: I can't believe you did that!!
CYNTHIA: Why?
ANN: I mean, I couldn't do that in front of John, even.
CYNTHIA: You couldn't do it, period.
ANN: You know what I mean, you don't even know him!
CYNTHIA: I feel like I do.
ANN: That doesn't mean you do. You can't possibly trust him, he's... perverted.
CYNTHIA: He's harmless. He just sits around and looks at these tapes. What's the big deal?
ANN: So he's got this catalogue of women touching themselves? That doesn't make you feel weird?
CYNTHIA: No. I don't think they all did what I did.
ANN: You are in serious trouble.
CYNTHIA: Ann, I don't understand why this freaks you out so much. You didn't do it, I did, and if it doesn't bother me, why should it bother you?
ANN: I don't want to discuss it.
CYNTHIA: Then why do you keep asking about it?
