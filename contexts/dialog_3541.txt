DUDE: I mean we totally fucked it up, man. We fucked up his pay-off. And got the kidnappers all pissed off, and the big Lebowski yelled at me a lot, but he didn't do anything. Huh?
WALTER: Well it's, sometimes the cathartic, uh.
DUDE: I'm saying if he knows I'm a fuck- up, then why does he still leave me in charge of getting back his wife? Because he fucking doesn't want her back, man! He's had enough! He no longer digs her! It's all a show! But then, why didn't he give a shit about his million bucks? I mean, he knew we didn't hand off his briefcase, but he never asked for it back.
WALTER: What's your point, Dude?
DUDE: His million bucks was never in it, man! There was no money in that briefcase! He was hoping they'd kill her! You throw out a ringer for a ringer!
WALTER: Yeah?
DUDE: Shit yeah!
WALTER: Okay, but how does all this add up to an emergency?
DUDE: Huh?
WALTER: I'm saying, I see what you're getting at, Dude, he kept the money, but my point is, here we are, it's shabbas, the sabbath, which I'm allowed to break only if it's a matter of life and death--
DUDE: Walter, come off it. You're not even fucking Jewish, you're--
WALTER: What the fuck are you talking about?
DUDE: You're fucking Polish Catholic--
WALTER: What the fuck are you talking about? I converted when I married Cynthia! Come on, Dude!
DUDE: Yeah, and you were--
WALTER: You know this!
DUDE: And you were divorced five fucking years ago.
WALTER: Yeah? What do you think happens when you get divorced? You turn in your library card? Get a new driver's license? Stop being Jewish?
DUDE: This driveway.
WALTER: I'm as Jewish as fucking Tevye
DUDE: It's just part of your whole sick Cynthia thing. Taking care of her fucking dog. Going to her fucking synagogue. You're living in the fucking past.
WALTER: Three thousand years of beautiful tradition, from Moses to Sandy Koufax-- YOU'RE GODDAMN RIGHT I LIVE IN THE PAST! I--Jesus. What the hell happened?
