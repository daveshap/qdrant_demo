What I've been through the last year or so and what I've done to get over these issues.
Hello /r/whatsbothering you,

I'm making this post because this subreddit has done a lot for me during a difficult time in my life. I wanted to give a little perspective of myself, what I've been through, how I've overcome the obstacle I've faced, in hope that this may help someone out there. This'll probably be pretty long, so buckle up haha.

I'm going into my third year of undergrad as a biochem premed student and I've always done very well in school, until last semester. Something happened; I wasn't myself, I was stressed, and unmotivated. What I realize now is that it was intense burnout and depression. It was crippling to my relationships with people and my academic career. I was anxious, exhausted, and very depressed. If I could go back, I would tell myself that it was ok to admit that I needed help. This was the biggest barrier for me: fear of my own humanity.

To overcome this horrible empty feeling I tried everything. I tried exercising, learning new talents, trying a new sleep schedule, just working harder, etc. But there was no solution, I felt lost and I felt like I was spiraling into mediocraty, and the worst of it all was my inability to change anything.

So earlier this year I made a change. I've journaled for a long time trying to process my feelings, but when that stopped working I reached out to the counseling service at my school. This was what jump started my road to getting back to my newer, refreshed self, but it took a long time, and that wasn't the only thing that did it for me. The benefit from counseling came from having a person who could sit and talk through your emotions and get passed irrational thinking. Also it gave me insight to the issues in my life aside from academics (i.e. non-ideal family situations).

Along with counseling for a few months I:

* ran as much as I could

* learned guitar

* began reading

* focused on unhealthy habits like staying up too late, not having a consistent sleep schedule, working on stuff in bed, watching netflix in bed (I switched to [radiolab](http://www.radiolab.org/) and it helped soooooo much with my sleep).

But it wasn't until recently that I felt like I was back on top and improving myself and from what I can tell it was a combination of these things that got me through a tough time as well as:

* being around and socializing with people

* **Nutrition**, it helped more than you can imagine. Having a balanced diet made me feel so much better and gave me more energy. This really came from cooking for myself and being aware of what I put into my body.

* Choosing something you are passionate about and learning about it (for me it is learning languages, music, and scientific material).

* Making sure to get out of the house.

* Separating my work, rest, and leisure areas and being very strict about it.

* The realization that I have the ability to choose how I feel and I have an active role in making sure I am happy.

* And finally, this is a big/hard one: **not procrastinating**. This is difficult because no one likes to do work, but the farther ahead you work the better education you will get and the more actual free time you have greatly increases.

That's pretty much it. A few other things that have given me inspiration is reading: [Think or Sink](http://www.amazon.com/Think-Sink-Choice-Changes-Everything-ebook/dp/B0036FTN3Q/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1405607716&sr=1-1&keywords=think+or+sink%3A+the+one), which explains how to actively choose how to think as well as the radio lab segment called [Secrets of Success](http://www.radiolab.org/story/91971-secrets-of-success/), which describes ways to come about success (it's long but worth it!).

Anyways, I've rambled on long enough. Hopefully someone out there finds this helpful, and if not I still want to say thank you to this subreddit. This community has helped me and I will continue to support it when I can.
