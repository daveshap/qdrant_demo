What can I do to start a meaningful career?
I'm 29 years old, and I still work a shitty minimum wage job that just doesn't pay the bills.

I went to college, I took Business Administration, and graduated in 2013. I had a few part time book keeping jobs over the years, but overall I never really benefited from this degree. I've had a number of jobs paying minimum wage or barely higher since then, most of them customer service, and a couple manual labor. I currently work with a retail inventory service as an inventory counter; I scan and count, there's nothing demanding or rewarding about it.

I want to do something with my life, I have a very low standard of living at the moment, and I'm really sick of living like this.

My issue is that I just have no idea what I should be doing to improve my life. Simply applying for jobs has been unfruitful, I'm unqualified for pretty much any well paying job, my education is dated, and business diplomas seem to be a dime a dozen. I could possibly take out another student loan and give college another shot, but I fear that I will have the same issue of not finding meaningful employment afterwards. I've thought about developing some computer skills through online courses (Code Academy, Udemy, Skillshare), and I've done a bit of that, but I'm still not sure how employable I can become being entirely self taught, and I'm not entirely sure a programming job would be right for me.

I'm pretty clueless when it comes to job hunting to be honest, it's kind of embarassing; being stuck in life like this feels awful. I could really use the wisdom of a kind stranger.
