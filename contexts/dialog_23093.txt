STU: Guess, I won't be needing this anymore.
SIDNEY: Why are you doing this?
STU: It's all part of the game.
BILLY: It's called GUESS HOW I'M GOING TO DIE!
SIDNEY: Fuck you.
BILLY: We already played that game. You lost, remember?
STU: You have to play, Sid. Don't want to disappoint your dad. He's been waiting around all night.
BILLY: It's an easy game. We ask you a question. If you get it wrong -- you die.
STU: And if you get it right -- you die.
SIDNEY: You're crazy -- both of you.
STU: The official term is psychotic"."
SIDNEY: You'll never get away with this.
BILLY: Tell that to Cotton Weary. You wouldn't believe how easy it was to frame him.
STU: Yeah, we just watched a few movies. Took a few notes. It was fun.
SIDNEY: Why did you kill my mother?
BILLY: Why? WHY? Did you hear that, Stu? I think she wants a motive. Hmmm... I don't really believe in motives, Sid. I mean, did Norman Bates have a motive?
STU: Nope.
BILLY: And did they really ever explain why Hannibal Lecter liked to eat people? Don't think so. You see, it's scarier when there's no motive, Sid.
SIDNEY: I don't understand...
BILLY: We did your mom a favor, Sid. The woman was a slut bag whore who flashed her shit all over town like she was Sharon Stone or something.
