SYBOK: Spock?
SPOCK: I cannot go with you.
SYBOK: Why not?
SPOCK: I belong here.
SYBOK: I don't understand...
SPOCK: Sybok, you are my brother, but you do not know me. I am not the outcast boy you left behind those many years ago. Since that time I have found myself and my place. I know who I am. And I cannot go with you.
