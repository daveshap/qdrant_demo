STAN: Okay. We'll get the money together. Don't worry about it, Jerry. Now, d'you want anyone at home, with you, until they call?
JERRY: No, I - they don't want - they're just s'posed to be dealin' with me, they were real clear.
STAN: Yah.
JERRY: Ya know, they said no one listenin' in, they'll be watchin', ya know. Maybe it's all bull, but like you said, Stan, they're callin' the shots.
STAN: Okay. And Scotty, is he gonna be all right?
JERRY: Yah, geez, Scotty. I'll go talk to him.
