BETTY: Hello, Mr. Sheldrake. On that Bases Loaded. I covered it with a 2-page synopsis. But I wouldn't bother.
SHELDRAKE: What's wrong with it?
BETTY: It's from hunger.
SHELDRAKE: Nothing for Ladd?
BETTY: Just a rehash of something that wasn't very good to begin with.
SHELDRAKE: I'm sure you'll be glad to meet Mr. Gillis. He wrote it.
SHELDRAKE: This is Miss Kramer.
BETTY: Schaefer. Betty Schaefer. And right now I wish I could crawl into a hole and pull it in after me.
GILLIS: If I could be of any help...
BETTY: I'm sorry, Mr. Gillis, but I just don't think it's any good. I found it flat and banal.
GILLIS: Exactly what kind of material do you recommend? James Joyce? Dostoosvsky?
SHELDRAKE: Name dropper.
BETTY: I just think pictures should say a little something.
GILLIS: Oh, you're one of the message kids. Just a story won't do. You'd have turned down Gone With the Wind.
SHELDRAKE: No, that was me. I said, Who wants to see a Civil War picture?
BETTY: Perhaps the reason I hated Bases Loaded is that I knew your name. I'd always heard you had some talent.
GILLIS: That was last year. This year I'm trying to earn a living.
BETTY: So you take Plot 27-A, make it glossy, make it slick --
SHELDRAKE: Carefull Those are dirty words! You sound like a bunch of New York critics. Thank you, Miss Schaefer.
BETTY: Goodbye, Mr. Gillis.
