VICKY: Vanderbilt's not that far from U of M.
JESSICA: Yeah right.
VICKY: What? We both have cars.
JESSICA: Yeah but, no offense, you're talking about a post-high school, long- distance relationship, and you and Kevin haven't even done it yet.
VICKY: That's not why we're going out.
JESSICA: What the hell are you expecting him to drive to Vanderbilt for? Milk and cookies?
VICKY: Jessica! He'll drive there for me, and I'll drive to Ann Arbor for him. We're going to have sex when he's ready and I'm ready. It's got to be completely perfect. I want the right place, the right time, the right moment.
JESSICA: Vicky, it's not a space shuttle launch, it's sex. So did you do the physics write-up?
VICKY: Please.
JIM: There's our man.
KEVIN: Finch, you got the Latin homework?
