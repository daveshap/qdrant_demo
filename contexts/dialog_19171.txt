ROGER: Ah...fine. Let me make an adjustment here, and we'll be ready to rock 'n roll. Oh...uh, the dumbass at the donut place put a chocolate cream filled I asked for in your box.
MICKEY: There's a chocolate cream filled in there?
ROGER: Yeah. Ya see, I ordered that special.
MICKEY: Tough titty, it's mine now.
ROGER: Look, I'll trade you.
WAYNE: Roger, enough with the fucking donuts! What did I tell you. Stop bothering Mickey, and get behind your nagra.
ROGER: Fine. Roger, what the hell are you doing? You're bothering the serial killer.
WAYNE: Sorry about that.
MICKEY: Don't worry about it.
WAYNE: We're about ready to go here. Are you ready?
MICKEY: Let's do it.
