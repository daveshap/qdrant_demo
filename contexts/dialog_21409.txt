EDWARD: Mr. Kross, I'm not here to sell you my stock. On the contrary, I'm here to buy yours.
KROSS: You've got a lot of nerve.
EDWARD: No. What I have is a lot of money.
KROSS: I know all about you, Mr. Harris. When you buy companies, they have a way of disappearing. Even the pension funds are stripped clean. The last three companies you took over were cut up in so many pieces, widows were left without their retirement checks.
EDWARD: What I did with those companies was perfectly legal.
KROSS: I don't question the legality of what you do. It's your morality that makes me sick. I will not allow my company to be raped by a man like you.
EDWARD: It is <u>not</u> your company. It's a public company. And I <u>am</u> going to acquire it. Either I buy from the other stock holders, or I buy from you.
