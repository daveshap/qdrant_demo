DWIGHT: I finished all the interviews.
PROFESSOR: Let me see the files.
DWIGHT: They're on top of the bookshelf. I'll get them.
PROFESSOR: Let me help you.
DWIGHT: I don't need your help. I'm perfectly capable.
DWIGHT: Here you go, Professor.
PROFESSOR: Are these all the subjects?
DWIGHT: Yes. The scored all over the Kiersey Temperament Sorter just like you asked for.
PROFESSOR: Any of them hot?
DWIGHT: I also took the liberty of putting those with near-death experiences on top.
PROFESSOR: Good thinking, Dwight. Traumatized co-eds are a sure thing.
DWIGHT: As I am sure you are aware, Professor, subjects who are close to death are statistically more likely to have the suggestibility required for paranormal investigation, which is, of course, why I've given them special consideration.
PROFESSOR: Look, whatever you say, kid, but the more they're hurtin', the more they need a squirtin', if you know what I mean. Ooh, I like her.
DWIGHT: Cindy Campbell. Classic abandoned personality disorder. She seems guarded, but willing to do this.
PROFESSOR: Willing? I like that. And, this one?
DWIGHT: That's Ray Williams. I couldn't quite figure him out, but he seemed very eager and excited when we met.
PROFESSOR: What's this?
