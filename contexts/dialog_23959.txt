UNCLE AL: Holy-jumped-up-baldheaded-Jesus-CHRIST!
JANE: Uncle Al-
MARTY: It came for me! I shot it in the eye! Now he's wearing an eye-patch!
UNCLE AL: I called Peltzer on my way over here, Marty! Father Lowe came into the drugstore two days ago for a bottle of otic solution. That's a fancy way of saying eyewash. He's got a corneal inflammation.
MARTY: Was it a prescription?
UNCLE AL: What the hell does that matter?
MARTY: It wasn't- I'll bet you it wasn't. Because to get a prescription he'd have to see a doctor.
UNCLE AL: Marty, Marty, you should hear yourself!
MARTY: Well... was it a prescription?
UNCLE AL: I don't know. But I know you didn't see any werewolf the other night, Marty. You had a dream, that's all. An extremely realistic nightmare brought on by what's been happening in this town.
MARTY: What about the baseball bat Jane saw in his shed? You know who used to have a baseball bat like that? Mr. Knopfler! He was so proud of it he used to carry it in the Fourth of July parade! Jane said it looked like the Green Giant used it for a toothpick!
UNCLE AL: You want to know what I think?
MARTY: No- we just got you out here so we could admire your pretty face.
UNCLE AL: Watch it, dear boy. I think it was a hallucination. Probably a broomstick, or something.
