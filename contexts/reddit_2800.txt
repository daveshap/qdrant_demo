It feels like everyone has a "calling". How do I figure out my calling?
So, I was going to be a doctor. Then I found the love of my life and realized I didn't want to wait ten years before I'm working as a doctor. Now I'm thinking of going to grad school for I/O psychology, but I keep hearing that maybe there are no jobs in this field.

I keep bouncing around and I don't know where I'm heading. I have the opportunity to be whatever I want to be, I'm just so terrified of making the wrong choice. I almost have my bachelors in psychology and am trying to figure out if I should put in some extra time to get my pre-PA or pre-med classes done with just in case, or if I should just move into grad school.

I always wanted to help people. But I also have this sense that I need to prove that I'm smart and can achieve a distinguished position like a doctor or lawyer. I need to be proud of myself. I want to change the world and be able to afford to send my kids to college. Sorry for this rant, I just want to know if anyone can relate to this early life crisis and if any real people have real advice.
