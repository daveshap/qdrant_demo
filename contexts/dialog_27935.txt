CHARLIE: Now I know I didn't hurt nobody when I was drunk - -
GALBRAITH: Of course, not, Charlie. I never thought you did.
CHARLIE: And my leopard - - maybe he hurt the first girl -- but no more.
JERRY: You must admit it's possible that it might have been a man.
GALBRAITH: Just barely possible - - yes.
JERRY: You know a lot. You've taken a lot of fancy courses in colleges and that kind of stuff - - what kind of a man would kill like that?
GALBRAITH: But all those fancy courses were about the dead, Jerry, not the living.
JERRY: All right -- the dead, then. In history there must have been men like that -- men with kinks in their brains --
GALBRAITH: Yes. There have been men who kill for pleasure -- strange pleasure. There was Blue Beard in France -- Jack The Ripper in London. It's not uncommon.
JERRY: If there were a man like that, with a kink in his brain around here loose, what would he be like.
GALBRAITH: To the eye? Like other men.
JERRY: I don't mean that. How would he act? What would he do?
GALBRAITH: He'd act normally when he was with other people. It would be a man who suffered remorse and even pity when it was all over.
JERRY: Couldn't you tell a man like that when you saw him?
GALBRAITH: No. He would be a hard man to find, Jerry. Particularly if he were a clever men. He would go about his ordinary business calmly and coolly except when the fit to kill was on him.
JERRY: You've thought of all this before. You know it isn't the leopard —— Don't you?
