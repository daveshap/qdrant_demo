Help...
I'm turning 15, my entire life has been with my parents due to me being the youngest by 7 years in my family. So it has always been just me and my parents because my siblings are always off somewhere else. I was just informed 2 days ago there getting a divorce. I have never considered them getting a divorce. So I'm wondering if anyone has been in a similar position. If so how did you walk through it. Or what helped to get through.
