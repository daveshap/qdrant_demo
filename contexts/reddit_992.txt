Does anyone else get stomach pains and diarrhea with their anxiety?
My anxiety is partly linked to my extreme emetophobia (fear of vomiting) and for those of you who don't know about it, it ruins every aspect of my life, to the point where if I get the slightest stomach pain or uncomfortable feeling ill panic, which results in me having stomach pains all the time, and sometimes, maybe once a month or so I'll come across feeling awful, with crippling stomach pains and end up on the toilet for half an hour with poop coming out like a faucet, does anyone else experience diarrhea along with their anxiety? It really sucks
