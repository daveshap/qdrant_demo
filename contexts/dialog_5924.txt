BUSTER: He *sniffs* that ether! I've seen him do it!
HOMER: It's because he's too tired to sleep. He has to.
BUSTER: He *smells* like he could put you to sleep!
HOMER: He's a doctor, Buster--doctors smell like ether.
BUSTER: *You're* a doctor, Homer--you don't smell like ether.
HOMER: I'm *not* a doctor. I haven't been to medical school--I haven't even been to high school!
BUSTER: But you've studied with the old man for *years*!
HOMER: I'm *not* a doctor!
BUSTER: I'm sorry, Homer.
LARCH: Fuzzy is not uncommon. I tell you, there's something about the premature babies of alcoholic mothers. They seem susceptible to every damn thing that comes along.
HOMER: I haven't read that.
LARCH: I haven't, either. But you *will*. The morons who write the books should do a little research *here*.
HOMER: But isn't Fuzzy just... well, underdeveloped?
LARCH: When *doesn't* he have bronchitis? I wouldn't call his bronchial infections underdeveloped." Would you?"
