Convert 'beep' to 'click' sound I'm currently using a metronome with a 'beep' sound that I find quite annoying. I prefer the standalone metronome to a phone app but there's no way to change the sound it makes.Is there some way I could maybe use an op-amp or 555 timer to convert the beep to a click using a small low powered simple device that a newb like me could build?I've spent ages here and on google searching but not found anything like what I'm looking for. I'd rather use my current metronome as the timing source because it's accurate and easy to set to an exact beat.Many thanks in advance.
