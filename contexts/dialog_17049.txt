TUBBS: And?...
JIM: I killed them.
TUBBS: Oh, shit, shit, shit - I don't know about all this! You sure?!
JIM: Yeah I'm sure! I did it with my own hands!
TUBBS: Jimmy, do you realize what you did? Man that's like death penalty shit -
JIM: It was self-defense, Tubbs! They're dirty! I walked in on something, I don't know what -
TUBBS: You gotta turn yourself in. Before it's too late -
JIM: They're inside the department, they're everywhere - it's not safe.
TUBBS: Shit, you know what happens to me if I'm harboring a fugitive? I already think they're on to me! I thought you were the phone police for Chrissake!
JIM: I have nowhere else to go, Tubbs, I need your help!
TUBBS: Oh man...what happened?
JIM: I don't know. But I'm in trouble. I'm all over the papers. I have to figure out what's going on.
TUBBS: Alright...alright...you've saved my ass enough times. What do you want to do?
JIM: I hope you haven't lost your touch with this stuff.
TUBBS: Shit, what I have now made our setup in Angola look like Tinker Toys. I've been skipping through Internal Revenue records all day. I even have video strip poker. You want to check it out?
JIM: I've got a better idea...
TUBBS: OK...where do you want to start?
