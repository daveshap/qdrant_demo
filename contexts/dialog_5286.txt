AL: When I left here with the money...
NICKY: Mm.
AL: ...I got muscled on the street.
NICKY: Mm.
AL: A couple of guys, I owe them. So, that's what I did. I gave 'em the money. That's what I did.
NICKY: Yeah?
AL: Yeah.
NICKY: You call yourself a man? You know you're a lyin', low-life, motherfuckin' gambling degenerate prick? You know that's what you are? Two small kids at home. I gave you money to pay the fuckin' rent and buy groceries, put the heat on. You know your wife called Frankie and told him the fuckin' heat's off?
