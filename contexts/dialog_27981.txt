THELMA: Jimmy! Hello, stranger. What in the world are you doin' here?
JIMMY: Ask me no questions, I'll tell you no lies.
THELMA: Good answer. Same goes double for me.
JIMMY: Who's your friend?
THELMA: This is J.D. He's a student. We're just givin' him a ride to... to here. Louise said we could bring him here and then he'd have to go. And that's what he's doin'. He's goin'. Aren't you, J.D.?
J.D.: Yup. Thanks for the ride. You all take care.
THELMA: Yup. That's him goin'. I love to watch him go.
LOUISE: Thelma kinda took to him.
JIMMY: Well, come on, gal, I got you a room. You can go on in and take a nice cold shower.
THELMA: Don't mind me, Jimmy, I'm just a wild woman.
JIMMY: I always knew that.
THELMA: A regular outlaw.
