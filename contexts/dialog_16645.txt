MONICA: Ah, Mom.
CAMILLE: I'm lucky I found it. Someone put your box of dresses under a pile of rags in the garbage.
MONICA: I hate it.
CAMILLE: Fine, you don't like this one, which one would you rather wear?
MONICA: Pants.
CAMILLE: When you're done can you make sure she brushes her teeth?
LENA: Are you okay?
CAMILLE: I just need to lay down. I've been running around all day.
NATHAN: Which one for tomorrow?
CAMILLE: The blue.
NATHAN: You sure?
CAMILLE: Okay.
NATHAN: Thanks, sweetheart.
