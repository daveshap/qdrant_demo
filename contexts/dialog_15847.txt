EMMETT: What the hell is that for?
ELLE: The bags under your eyes. You're an attractive man, but you need to take better care of yourself.
EMMETT: I don't -- Do that stuff.
ELLE: Well, you should -- If you look good, you feel good and if you feel good, you project joy into the world.
EMMETT: Projecting joy is not my job.
ELLE: Fine. Sorry I brought it up.
EMMETT: You really think I'm attractive?
ELLE: For a butt-head? Yes.
