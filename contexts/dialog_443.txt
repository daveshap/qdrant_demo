ALICE: I don't understand what's happening. Krueger has to use my dreams, but he got to Dan and Greta while I was awake. How's he doing it?
YVONNE: Why don't you two stick to reality.
MARK: Why don't you shut up and let her talk! Two of us died in the last two days, does that strike you as particularly normal?!
YVONNE: Mark...
MARK: I'm not finished - I loved Greta. A lot. And if maybe, just maybe, someone or some thing killed her, I'd like to hear about it!
YVONNE: I can't listen to this.
MARK: Then get out!
ALICE: Mark!
