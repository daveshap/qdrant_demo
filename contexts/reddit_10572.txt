I wish I could trade places with kids that are actually abused.
Because, then, I’d actually have a real excuse as to why I’m like this. I wish my family didn’t love me. I wish they’d beat me. I wish I was raped. I wish I could take the place of every actually abused kid, because they don’t deserve to be hurt. 

My mom is so loving it makes me feel terrible. When she gets me donuts in the morning. When she brings me breakfast and I don’t do shit for her. My grandfather, whom I live with, is working his ass off most nights, and yet I can’t even be bothered to pick up the trash I leave around the house, or go outside to help him with groceries. 

Maybe it’s my mental illness talking, but I genuinely hate how I am. How everything I do is selfish and how uncaring and unhelpful I am. 

A few months ago, I was practically begging my mom to take her anger out on me, to beat me, because I wanted an excuse to be depressed. I wanted to be traumatized, like she was from her own past. 

They buy me so many electronics I shouldn’t even have. I’ve dropped out of school, and when I was in school I’d missed so many days a school councelor visited my home. I’d ran away so many times, worrying them until their worry turned to anger. 

They’ve given me everything, and yet I’m so ungrateful.
