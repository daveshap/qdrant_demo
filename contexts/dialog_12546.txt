BUBBER: Same with me, pretending I was you. An impulse. Why not? I had this shoe.
BERNIE: There was this kid there saying, Go in there and save my father

BERNIE: So now you gotta wear it, you poor bastard. Everyday you gotta be everybody's hero. People watching you all the time. Waiting for you to make... a slip. Slip up.
