10 Credit Hours vs 13 Credit Hours
Hello,

I am starting my masters degree in the fall, and I’ve found myself with a weird (to me) problem. 

As of now, I am taking 10 credit hours in the fall. My PI wants me to take an additional class that is very relevant to the research I will be doing, but may not be greatly relevant to my actual degree. If I were to take this class, I would be at 13 credit hours. 

My questions are:
1. should I take this extra class, even if doesn’t apply to my degree?
2. What is a reasonable class load to have for a first year grad student? 

Lemme know what you think!
