My self care plan, and I'd appreciate some further advice.
Hello everyone,

I'm a 26 year old woman and I suffer from depression. I'm in therapy and on antidepressants. I attempted suicide in April 2018 but, since then, I've made a lot of progress and I'm quite happy with myself. But loneliness is still a major trigger for my depression. Tomorrow I'll leave for another city because I have to participate in a public competition for a workplace (I'm in Italy so, in order to work for the Government, you have to participate to public selections). 

Problem: I don't know anyone in this city so I'll be alone for seven days. Yes, I'll meet other people who apply for the same selection, but at the end of the day I'll return to my hotel room and I'll be alone. And I'm very scared. 

This is my self care plan, that I organized with my therapist:

\- focusing on the public selection;

\- bringing my favourite books;

\- Netflix for the nights;

\- going to fine restaurants and enjoying good food

\- visiting the city in my spare time 

\- calling my SO and/or friends if I really feel overwhelmed 

Do you have any other advice? I'm a bit anxious. 

Thank you!
