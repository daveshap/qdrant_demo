Can malware be installed on a mobile phone when the user opens an sms? Is it possible for an adversary send malware over messages? I mean, when the victim clicks on the message sent by the attacker, a malware should be installed into his phone (in background). The hacker should then be able to steal all the data in the victim's phone. Is it really possible? How to perform this attack? What are the possible ways to mitigate risk?
