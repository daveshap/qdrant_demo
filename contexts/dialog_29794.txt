CLARENCE: Ya know, I used to fuckin' hate airports.
ALABAMA: Really?
CLARENCE: With a vengeance, I hated them.
ALABAMA: How come?
CLARENCE: I used to live by one back in Dearborn. It's real frustratin' to be surrounded by airplanes when you ain't got shit. I hated where I was, but I couldn't do anythin' about it. I didn't have enough money. It was tough enough just tryin' to pay my rent every month, an' here I was livin' next to an airport. Whenever I went outside, I saw fuckin' planes take off drownin' out my show. All day long I'm seein', hearin' people doin' what I wanted to do most, but couldn't.
ALABAMA: What?
CLARENCE: Leavin' Detroit. Goin' off on vacations, startin' new lives, business trips. Fun, fun, fun, fun.
CLARENCE: But knowin' me and you gonna be nigger-rich gives me a whole new outlook. I love airports now. Me 'n' you can get on any one of those planes out there, and go anywhere we ant.
ALABAMA: You ain't kiddin', we got lives to start over, we should go somewhere where we can really start from scatch.
CLARENCE: I been in America all my life. I'm due for a change. I wanna see what TV in other countries is like. Besides, it's more dramatic. Where should we fly off to, my little turtledove?
ALABAMA: Cancoon.
CLARENCE: Why Cancoon?
ALABAMA: It's got a nice ring to it. It sounds like a movie. Clarence and Alabama Go to Cancoon". Don't 'cha think?"
CLARENCE: But in my movie, baby, you get the top billing.
