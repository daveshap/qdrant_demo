MULDER: Is this Dr. Kurtzweil's residence?
DETECTIVE: You got some kind of business with him?
MULDER: I'm looking for him.
DETECTIVE: Looking for him for what?
DETECTIVE: Feds are looking for him, too. Real nice business he's got, huh?
MULDER: What's that?
DETECTIVE: Selling naked pictures of little kids over his computer.
DETECTIVE: You looking for him for some other reason?
MULDER: Yeah, I had an appointment for a pelvic examination.
DETECTIVE: You want a call if we turn up Kurtzweil?
MULDER: No. Don't bother.
KURTZWEIL: See this bullshit...? Somebody knows I'm talking to you.
MULDER: Not according to the men in blue.
KURTZWEIL: What is it? Kiddie porn again? Sexual battery of a patient? I've had my license taken away in three states.
MULDER: They want to discredit you -- for what?
KURTZWEIL: For what? Because I'm a dangerous man. Because I know too much about the truth.
MULDER: You mean that apocalyptic trash you write? I knew your name was familiar. I just didn't know why.
KURTZWEIL: You know my work?
MULDER: Dr. Kurtzweil, I'm not interested in bigoted ideas about race or genocide. I don't believe in the Elders of Zion, the Knights Templar, the Bilderburg Group or in a oneworld Jew run government --
KURTZWEIL: I don't either, but it sure sells books.
KURTZWEIL: I was right about Dallas. Wasn't I, Agent Mulder?
MULDER: How?
KURTZWEIL: I picked up the historical document of the venality and hypocrisy of the American government. The daily newspaper.
MULDER: You said the firemen and the boy were found in the temporary offices of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Why?
KURTZWEIL: According to the newspaper, FEMA had been called out to manage an outbreak of the Hanta virus. Are you familiar with the Hanta virus, Agent Mulder?
MULDER: It was a deadly virus spread by field mice in the Southwest U.S. several years ago.
KURTZWEIL: And are you familiar with FEMA? What the Federal Emergency Management Agency's real power is? FEMA allows the White House to suspend constitutional government upon declaration of a national emergency. To create a non-elected government. Think about that. What is an agency with such broad sweeping power doing managing a small viral outbreak in suburban Texas?
MULDER: Are you saying it wasn't such a small outbreak?
