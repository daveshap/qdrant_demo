What achievements changed with the release of 3.0? The release of the 3.0 Fall of Oriath expansion removed difficulty levels and achievements previously related to beating the game in higher difficulties got changed into different achievements.Which achievements turned into which new achievements?I know I now have Deicide (kill a god and obtain their power), and apparently achieved it in december 2016, but I most certainly did not do that yet, and most certainly not back in December, half a year before the expansion was even released... Other achievements that I got that were most certainly changed: Deadly SinsOmnipotentLoyal to the EndThere might be others I have, but it's been a long time so I don't remember exactly what happened where in the story.
