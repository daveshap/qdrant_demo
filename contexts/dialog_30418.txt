BOYD: This is a situation that defies judgement. We have acted and showed courage that is not of a kind known by most.
FISHER: I'm getting really tired of your bullshit.
BOYD: My what?
FISHER: You've got a warped thought process. Your brain doesn't function properly.
BOYD: You care to add a little specification to that slanderous accusation?
FISHER: I'm talking about some bad, bad, very bad things. Bad things! Those are bad fucking things!
BOYD: Okay fine.
FISHER: Fine? Fine what?
BOYD: Whatever you say Kojak.
FISHER: I'm serious.
BOYD: I'm serious. I'm the serious one here. I'm the one making the play. I'm the Indian Runner. And I want my money.
LIZ: I told Boyd two fucking minutes!
FISHER: What money?
BOYD: Blood money. Insurance dollars that you have thus fucking far decided not to tell me about at all. In no way have you mentioned that money. And I find that to be very very offensive.
FISHER: You're sick.
BOYD: And if you think you can fuck me, don't. Cause I'm fucking insulated Fisher. Protected. Backed up on floppy. Do you get me? I want my fucking money!
FISHER: Not a prayer.
BOYD: I'm a lifesaver. A lighthouse. Up all night in the rain, in stormy gale force wind, tornado and fucking earthquakes. I stay lit for you. I stay lit. I don't go dark. I never go dark!
FISHER: You need help.
