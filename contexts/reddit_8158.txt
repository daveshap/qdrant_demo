Today, Paul Manafort was sentenced to 47 months with 9 months served for his financial crimes. With an emphasis on precedent of similar crimes, is this sentence appropriate?
Today [Judge T.S. Ellis III sentenced](https://www.apnews.com/949df95ef74348baa809bbf031c37fc7) Paul Manafort to 47 months in Federal prison, with 9 months served for the time he has already been jailed.

The sentencing guidelines had called for 19-24 years but Judge Ellis gave [reasoning on why](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/07/us/politics/paul-manafort-sentencing.html) it should be shorter in this case:

> Judge Ellis said that Mr. Manafort “has lived an otherwise blameless life,” and he cited other tax cases that had resulted in minimal prison time. “The government cannot sweep away the history of all these other sentences,” he said.

In addition to prison:

> The judge ordered Mr. Manafort to pay $25 million in restitution and a $50,000 fine.

Some Democrats have expressed [outrage at the sentence](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/manafort-s-light-sentence-criticized-disrespectful-lenient-outrage-n980821):

> Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York said, "In our current broken system, 'justice' isn't blind, it's bought."

> "Crimes committed in an office building should be treated as seriously as crimes committed on a street corner," Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota said on Twitter.
