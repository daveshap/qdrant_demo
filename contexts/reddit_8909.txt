What are the pros and cons of continuing austerity programs (e.g. Greece)?
This summer has seen extreme weather, in particular extended heat waves and wildfires, across the globe- including Europe, South Asia, Japan, and the United States. Leading experts believe such concetrations of extreme weather are 'the face of climate change' as [Prof. Michael Mann of Penn State University says](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/27/extreme-global-weather-climate-change-michael-mann).

This week saw deadly wildfires near Athens, with close to a hundred dead and widespread damage. The government has [received criticism for its response](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/28/greece-wildfires-firefighters-attack-government-response), including from Greece's Federation of Firefighters. Within that story is an argument that the loss of life was influenced by Greek's austerity programs:

>Echoing Varoufakis’s argument that austerity inflicted on Greece had also played a role in the inability of authorities to respond effectively to the disaster, Stathopoulos admitted that budget cuts had rendered at least 30% of the service’s fire engines useless. The debt-stricken country has applied the tough measures in return for bailout loans to keep bankruptcy at bay.

>“About 15% of our fleet of 1,750 trucks are off the roads because they have chronic problems and are old,” he said. “Another 15% are in need of spare parts which we can’t afford. As firefighters we take an oath to protect people and their properties. We know when to recommend that areas be evacuated, but for some reason our recommendation was not heard. This is a huge tragedy for our country and apologies are owed.”

**Austerity, the process of reducing the deficit (and perhaps the debt) of a state through tax increases and budget cuts,** has been a common theme of post-Great Recession Europe. Greece has had an unusually long, severe austerity regime running, approaching a decade and length ([see the latter part of the BBC's timeline of Greek history](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-17373216)). The European Union, in its negotiations with Greece, have demanded cuts to the fire service that led to its budget being [reduced almost a quarter from 2009 levels](https://phys.org/news/2018-07-greek-tragedy-suprise.html).

Austerity has been promoted by many establishment officials and economists. A famous academic study by Reinhart and Rogoff of Harvard found that high national debt inhibited growth. While some of their underlying math has since been challenged, [there is a substantial community that believes their findings are still true](https://www.ft.com/content/2df58ce0-a8ba-11e2-bcfb-00144feabdc0) and support austerity programs.

The evidence of austerity being an effective strategy for debt is contentious. Two economists for the International Monetary Fund (IMF), an organization known for advocating austerity through 'structural adjustment', [released an article saying that neoliberalism](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2016/06/ostry.htm), the ideology under which austerity is advocated as a solution, is 'oversold'. In part:

>However, there are aspects of the neoliberal agenda that have not delivered as expected. Our assessment of the agenda is confined to the effects of two policies: removing restrictions on the movement of capital across a country’s borders (so-called capital account liberalization); and fiscal consolidation, sometimes called “austerity,” which is shorthand for policies to reduce fiscal deficits and debt levels. An assessment of these specific policies (rather than the broad neoliberal agenda) reaches three disquieting conclusions:

>•The benefits in terms of increased growth seem fairly difficult to establish when looking at a broad group of countries.­

>•The costs in terms of increased inequality are prominent. Such costs epitomize the trade-off between the growth and equity effects of some aspects of the neoliberal agenda.­

>•Increased inequality in turn hurts the level and sustainability of growth. Even if growth is the sole or main purpose of the neoliberal agenda, advocates of that agenda still need to pay attention to the distributional effects.­

There are numerous proposed alternatives to austerity as currently practiced (though [some commentators have insisted that there is in fact, no alternative](https://www.ft.com/content/7864786c-92aa-11e1-b6e2-00144feab49a)). The Guardian [compiled ten proposals from across the spectrum](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/19/alternatives-austerity-ideas-across-spectrum) in regards to the United Kingdom's austerity program, which began around the 2010 election.
