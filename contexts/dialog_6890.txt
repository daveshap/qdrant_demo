KATHRYN: Get off me!
SEBASTIAN: Will you calm down?
KATHRYN: Fine! Get off me!
SEBASTIAN: I'm very sorry about that. I apologize.
KATHRYN: I accept. Now get out.
SEBASTIAN: Get out? We had an arrangement.
KATHRYN: Didn't you hear what I said?
SEBASTIAN: I don't care what you said, we had an agreement. You've slept with half of the borough so don't tell me you're being choosy.
KATHRYN: Get out!
SEBASTIAN: I'm giving you to the count of three to plop your ass down on the bed.
KATHRYN: And if I don't?
SEBASTIAN: Then I will consider it a declaration of war. One. Two... three.
KATHRYN: I think you have your answer.
SEBASTIAN: War it is.
SEBASTIAN: It's desperate that I talk to her.
MRS. O'SHEA: I've already told you, she's not home.
SEBASTIAN: Well please leave a message that I called.
MRS. O'SHEA: I'll do that.
