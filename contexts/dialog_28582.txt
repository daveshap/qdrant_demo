VOX: When was his mother taken?
ALEXANDER: Last night.
VOX: Send him away.
ALEXANDER: What?
VOX: Send him home. You don't want him to see it.
ALEXANDER: Kalen... hold on a minute.
ALEXANDER: I think we should go on by ourselves.
KALEN: No...
ALEXANDER: Please, just listen to me... Your mother would be very cross with me if you got hurt. I'll find her.
KALEN: But you're only a mud carrier.
ALEXANDER: I'll be all right... You go back to the village and light the fire. So we can find our way home.
