What is the exact definition of "election interference" and what US Law makes this illegal?
There have been widespread allegations of Russian government interference in the 2016 presidential election. The Director of National Intelligence, in January 2017, produced a report which alleged that:

Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election. Russiaâ€™s goals were to undermine public faith in the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency. We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump.

In addition, "contemporaneous evidence of Russia's election interference" is alleged to have been one of the bases for a FISA warrant against former Trump campaign official Carter Page.

What are the specific acts of "election interference" which are known or alleged? Do they differ from ordinary electoral techniques and tactics? Which, if any, of those acts are crimes under current US Law? Are there comparable acts in the past which have been successfully prosecuted?
