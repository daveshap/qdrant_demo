How can I show past work without breaking confidentiality agreements?
I'm a graphic designer who specializes in advertising for rewards/loyalty. Mostly branding stuff, like "this is our style guide, please make us ads for x, y, z products for a, b, c events". I'd love to update my portfolio with the work I've done, but it's not kosher to my contract. 

Are there any other artists in this sub? Should I make a secret portfolio page that's unlisted? Maybe "re-do" some past work?
