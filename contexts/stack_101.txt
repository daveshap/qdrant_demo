Best version of DOSBox for macOS (Homebrew version seems abandoned) I've been using DOSBox through Homebrew for years, and now it won't update because of a SHA256 mismatch error. I tried all possible updates and cleanups in Homebrew to no avail. According to Homebrew, this means the brew is abandoned. DOSBox was last updated in 2010. What is the best version of DOSBox for macOS, preferably available through Homebrew?
