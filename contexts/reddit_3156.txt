How can I find entry level employment out of state?
I have been applying to entry level HR positions out of state. I'm a 22M, 6 months into an employment services specialist position (I graduated with my bachelor's in Business Admin in August).

I don't know what to do if I hear back from any because I am not living close, I don't have money saved to travel, and I don't currently in the cities in applying to. I would be looking to relocate asap based upon vocation opportunity. 

I feel like bigger companies might help with some expenses if I were to get an interview; however, with these companies I'm competing with so many applicants. 

I feel like smaller companies, where I'm competing with less applicants, might be preferential to locals because they probably can't afford to help with any travel expenses for interviews. 

Am I wrong, right, how should I tackle this challenge? Should I just not worry about it and hope the right opportunity comes along? 

I cannot just move woth a job because i have little money saved and I'm still in a job in my current location.
