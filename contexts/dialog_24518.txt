RHEYA: What's happening to us?
KELVIN: It's all right.
RHEYA: Please don't lie. I told you before, I don't know how I came to be here. Whatever you think you can't say to me, I need to hear you say it.
KELVIN: I love you.
RHEYA: Don't. I'm the one at risk here. If we're playing out what happened before, I won't survive.
KELVIN: That won't happen again. We're different.
RHEYA: How can I tell? You've seen both of me. I only know what you're like here. You're all I know. There is no You" from before."
RHEYA: How could it be so cruel? How could it torture us like this?
KELVIN: I don't think it knows it's torturing us. It's just watching.
SNOW: What happened?
KELVIN: She drank liquid oxygen.
