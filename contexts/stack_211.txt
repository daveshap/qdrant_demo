Find EXACT app in App Store I just got an AT&amp;T SIM and was looking for an app to manage the account.A search came up with myAT&amp;T but when I try to search the App Store on the phone I get dozens of irrelevant apps, but NOT what I was looking for.How can I find EXACT app in App StoreEDIT I searched in Safari (on the phone with the AT&amp;T SIM), and clicked the link in the answer, but the result says \"This app is only available on the App Store for iOS devices\"I am in the US - connected to AT&amp;T, running iOS 10.3.3 (the latest for the iPhone5C)I can launch the App Store app, but there is no download link, and it states \"This app is only available on the App Store for iOS devices\".On my iPad I get an error \"The item you've requested is not currently available in the Australian Store\" - so I guess my problem then becomes how to use the US Store.
