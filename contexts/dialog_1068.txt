WOODWARD: Who's Charles Colson?
ROSENFELD: I would liken your query to being in Russia half a century ago and asking someone, I understand who Lenin is and Trotsky I got too
WOODWARD: Who's Colson, Harry?
ROSENFELD: The most powerful man in America is President Nixon, probably you've heard his name.
ROSENFELD: The second most powerful man is Robert Haldeman. Just below him are a trio: Mr. Erlichman is Haldeman's friend, and they protect the President from everybody which is why they are referred to as either The German Shepherds or the Berlin Wall. Mr. Mitchell we've already discussed. Mr. Colson is the President's special counsel.
WOODWARD: Thanks, Harry. Know anything about Colson?
ROSENFELD: Just that on his office wall there's a cartoon with a caption reading, When you've got them by the balls
WOODWARD: Hello, I'm Bob Woodward of the Washing Post and... Mullen and Company Public Relations? Could you tell me when you expect Mr. Hunt? He is?
HUNT: Howard Hunt here.
WOODWARD: Hi, I'm Bob Woodward of the Post and--
HUNT: --yes, yes, what is it?
WOODWARD: I was just kind of wondering why your name and phone number were in the address books of two of the men arrested at Watergate?
HUNT: Good God!
