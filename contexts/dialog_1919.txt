WILLARD: What about ducking into one of those tributaries till this river slows down?
CHIEF: Who knows what's up there?
WILLARD: Can't be any worse than this. What do you think?
CHIEF: I think this river wants to take us home fast. I'm practically goin' in reverse.
WILLARD: Well, get in there.
CHIEF: This whole area is lousy with V.C. -- We don't stand a chance. Lemme turn around and we'll be in Hau Fat in six minutes.
WILLARD: Get in there !
CHIEF: This is my crew and my fucking boat, and I'm the responsible party.
WILLARD: Get in there now or I'll bury you in this river.
