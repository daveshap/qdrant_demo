GRILLO: Lady, don't let him do it!
THEO: You got it wrong. I'm the one that's on your side.
GRILLO: You almost brain me and lock me in a fucking trunk and you're on my side? You stupid fuck!
LENORE: He's seen both of us now.
GRILLO: Look, I've got a wife. I don't care if either of you ever get caught.
LENORE: What else did you expect him to say? Do it, Theo -- or give me the gun.
THEO: I'm going to cuff you and leave you in that house. It may take awhile but you'll be found after we're long gone.
LENORE: That's not good enough.
THEO: That's how it's going to be.
THEO: Nels reporting in. Sit down where you are. Arms folded.
GRILLO: Yes sir.
THEO: Yeah?
NELSON: I just strolled out of the emergency room while they were admitting Rodriego.
THEO: You couldn't be calling at a worse time, Nels.
