MARYLIN: You don't like me?
MILES: I love you. I want to have your baby.
MARYLIN: What's wrong Miles? Did I spend too much?
MARYLIN: Miles. I have a very good relationship with all the salesmen. I can return everything.
MILES: Can you Marylin? Can you return the trust? Can you return the hopes? The dreams? Can you just... SEND IT ALL BACK FOR STORE CREDIT?
MARYLIN: Miles? You're scaring me.
MILES: I'm sorry, Darling. I love it. It's chic and timeless and elegant and eclectic and. It's you, Marylin. It is YOU.
