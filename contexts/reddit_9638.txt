I’ve lost hope in getting a job in Student Affair
So a few months back I posted about how I was losing hope in my Student Affairs job hunt. I got a lot of great advice that I took and I really want to thank you all for the assistance. However, after another four months of searching, I’m still back at square one, and I’ve been denied jobs that I thought I would finally get. I got a rejection letter yesterday from a place I had done my very best interviewing at, and honestly it broke me. I can’t see myself finding a job in this field anymore, and no other place outside Higher Ed has even seemed to consider me for any positions. I don’t know what else to do, and all I can think of is that I will never get into the field I’ve worked hard for. Anyway, thank you for listening, and sorry to bother you.
