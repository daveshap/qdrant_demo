ED: A coin's got two sides. When you flip it there's a fifty-fifty chance it'll be heads or tails. Boyd thinks if you flip a coin ten times half the time it'll come up each side.
BOYD: It will.
ED: No it won't. You just don't know shit about statistics.
BOYD: And what are you? A rocket scientist?
ED: I got more brains than you've got teeth.
BOYD: Put your money where your chicken- lipped mouth is. I'll bet this mornings pay I'm right.
