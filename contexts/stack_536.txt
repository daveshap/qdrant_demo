How to downgrade from Ubuntu 16.04.3 to 16.04? How can I downgrade from 16.04.3 to 16.04? I want to install Oracle Database 12c (12.1.0.2) on Ubuntu 16.04. The installation guide I refer to exactly Ubuntu 16.04. I'm having trouble running Oracle install scripts and there is an error message that these scripts must run at 16.4 and not 16.04.3 version (as I currently have). That's why I want to downgrade my Ubuntu. I am a new user of Ubuntu and hope you can help me with a light and hassle free proposal and instruction.I tried to downgrade my Ubuntu 16.04.3 to 16.04, but I would like to know if it is possible and how?
