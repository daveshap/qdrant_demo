ROBERT: I appreciate you coming in so early.
A.D.A. KELLY: Judge Wakefield, it's an honor to handle it for you. Consider it gone away. She's a minor; it probably would've expunged on her 18th birthday anyway.
ROBERT: Still, this was a sensitive issue for me and I wanted to thank you personally.
A.D.A. KELLY: Like I said, open container, P.I., Misdemeanor possession. Easy to make it disappear. For you, poof, it's gone.
A.D.A. KELLY: One thing bothers me... That kid they dropped off had coke and heroin in him. Serious amounts. He's lucky he lived. So I gotta ask: what's your daughter on?
ROBERT: I don't know what you mean.
A.D.A. KELLY: I mean, did you ask her? What kind of drugs has she tried?
ROBERT: I... I don't really know.
A.D.A. KELLY: Is she in any kind of therapy... professional help?
ROBERT: No, of course not. She's one of the top students at her school.
A.D.A. KELLY: Well, I hope it stays that way.
