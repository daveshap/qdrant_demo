MANK: I don't know what you expected with Joseph- fucking-Conrad for Chrissake. I mean this is Hollywood, pal.
WELLES: All right! Enough! I've heard this from Schaefer and RKO. I've heard it from everyone--
MANK: But you keep coming up with the same elitist crap - - HEART OF DARKNESS with a million dollar budget?! - - no one wants to see that.
WELLES: Nonsense
MANK: What are movies about, Orson?
WELLES: Forget it-
MANK: What are movies about?
WELLES: Telling stories.
MANK: Nope.
WELLES: Showing life
MANK: Who the hell wants to see life?! People are sick to death of life! They want make-believe, pal. Fantasy. They want Tarzan and Jane, not Tristan and Isolde.
WELLES: Magic
MANK: Butts on seats. That's what movies are about. You got one job in Hollywood -- everyone has the same job, in fact -- putting the butts on the seats. You gotta sell 'em popcorn and Pepsi- cola. It's all about popcorn and Pepsi-cola.
WELLES: Not for me.
MANK: Then you better get ready to be the youngest never- was in Hollywood history.
WELLES: That's better than being the oldest has-been in Hollywood history.
MANK: You're a laugh-riot, kid.
