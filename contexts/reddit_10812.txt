I just tried to call a couple of suicide prevention hotlines
And they were so busy that I was placed on hold, or asked to leave a message for a call back.

I have been seriously planning to kill myself today - I have enough sedatives for a lethal dose, and I’ve had a bottle of wine to myself genuinely planning to eat the lot, but I’ve been fighting the urge all day and I finally tried to call someone.

The fact that the lines were so busy made me realise I’m not alone - there must be countless people trying to call my country’s helplines and somehow it’s oddly comforting to know that the reason I can’t get through to someone is because so many other people are right on the edge.

I’ll keep trying to get through because I need someone to tell me I have a reason to keep living, but I just wanted to say that it was eye opening to realise so many people are in the same situation. 

It’s not like resenting people being in front of the queue at the supermarket. There may be someone out there with their wrists open and bleeding out, whilst I am just very close to acting. Who am I to take their place in the queue?

I guess it’s just strangely helpful to know that there are so many people feeling the same way I do.

Love and well wishes to anyone reading this.
