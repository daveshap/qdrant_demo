What would be the safest method to power a laptop (IdeaPad 510 15isk) from a 14.8v battery pack? Looking at my existing power jack and measuring it crudely with a cm ruler it looks like 3mm diameter x 1 cm length.  The laptop bottom and charging adapter both say 20v @ 3.25 A max. What would be the best way to deliver that power and have it remain smooth as the battery pack voltage drops from 16.8v to 11v (fully charged to dead) It looks like a chinesium boost/buck module would be my best bet once I set the voltage via a multimeter and epoxy the adjustment knob so their is no way it could possibly get turned or rotate its self slowly due to thermal expansion or something.  I do not favor this idea though mostly because of the fact that most of those crappy boards look poorly put together and I highly doubt that the output is very well regulated and I fear that if one of those does break it may send to much or to little voltage to the laptop.  Are their any other options? If the boost/buck is my only option are their any safeguards I could use (besides a fuse ofc)?
