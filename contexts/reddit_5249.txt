How to manage anger and frustration in the workplace?
I work at a tech company that seems to value a friendly workplace and a culture above everything. I don't have a problem with that, but this includes sugar coating a lot of issues at the workplace to avoid hurting anybody's feelings. And that I sometimes have a problem with.

I am a quite straightforward person who can sometimes come off as very blunt (I know it is a weakness on my part). My bluntness is not due to me being mean or rude, but just me wanting to say my piece and resolve issues as fast as possible.

For example, a few days ago, a support person who was working with one of my customers seemed to be repeatedly emailing the customer asking for the information that they have already provided regarding their issue. I took a problem with this because first, the customer was a prospect evaluating us before making a buying decision. Second, the customer was a large enterprise company with a name logo. So my opinion was that the support not making sure that they have all the information before reaching out to the customer is making us look unorganized and lazy. I wrote an internal note to this person stating this and note verbatim was "pardon me; I don't think repeatedly asking the customer to send the same information is very productive." The note was visible to his manager, as well as my manager.

I was trying to be as cordial as possible, but one of my colleagues pointed out that I might be coming off as hostile and accusatory. My thought process here is that I don't care. What needs to be said should be said. We are all adults here intending to bring revenue into the company, and I don't have time to care about feelings.

I know I am going wrong somewhere here, and I'd like to know how I can change my way of thinking, and what is the best way to approach situations like this?
