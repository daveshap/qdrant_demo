Graduating in a couple semesters with a degree in Business. What are my options.
I've been a pseudo- Assistant Manager in retail for the past 13 years.  Basically a glorified sticker with a set of keys.  It has convinced me that I don't want to have anything to do with retail or management though.  In a couple semesters, I should hopefully have a Bachelors Degree in Business with a slight concentration in I.T.  Lost as to what I should do now though.  I don't feel I have enough education to find a decent job in I.T. and I don't want to find another retail management job.  What are some options i'm not seeing right now?
