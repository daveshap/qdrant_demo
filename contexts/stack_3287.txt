Short story anthology, one story was about a leathery alien thing that had a fight with a bear I'm trying to find a sci-fi anthology I owned as a child from the early 80s/late 70s.  I think it was published in the UK by St Michael (Marks &amp; Spencer), but possibly not as I can't find it under that publisher.There is a St Michael sci-fi anthology called Beyond the Stars: Tales of Adventure in Time and Space, but that's not it as I think the book I remember contained the Ray Bradbury story \"A Sound of Thunder\though memory does play tricks...As I recall, one of the other stories was about a leathery alien thing that sort of rolled along and at one point had a fight with a bear (I think).  I recall that the alien thing in the story was sort of oval and leathery and that it used a knife blade to kill the bear.  I think the story or possibly the alien thing's name began with an \"O\". Some of the stories had illustrations.  Unfortunately I can't remember anything about the other stories in the collection.  Does anyone know what the anthology might be?
