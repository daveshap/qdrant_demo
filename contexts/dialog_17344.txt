TERESA: I'd like to eat something before I go back to work.
CHARLIE: Ok, we'll go for lunch.
TERESA: Do you have enough?
CHARLIE: Well...with the hotel that's ten... fifteen...
TERESA: Here.
TERESA: Please take it.
CHARLIE: Well...
TERESA: I don't mind.
CHARLIE: Sure...it's not that...I mean...
TERESA: It's all right.
CHARLIE: Well, if things go the way I hope they'll go, this money business will take care of itself. God willing.
TERESA: An apartment uptown? Downtown?
CHARLIE: Maybe, who knows.
TERESA: Charlie...?
CHARLIE: Nobody knows anything, believe me.
CHARLIE: See if you can get your hands on some pamphlets on laws or by laws...or proprietorship...you know...at your place.
TERESA: Anything specific?
CHARLIE: You know...like restaurants, night clubs...
TERESA: What is it now?
CHARLIE: Don't ask.
TERESA: Alright... Hey, did you hear any more about what happened last night?
CHARLIE: Did you?
TERESA: No.
CHARLIE: CHRIST, you should have seen it. Unbelievable. The kid would turn around and fire and he would just keep coming at him like Rasputin. That kid was scared. Not half as much as we were though.
TERESA: It doesn't make any sense. He wouldn't shoot him just because he insulted a racket guy...not unless it was personal.
CHARLIE: You missed the point. The kid's a climber...not very bright...but if you get down to his level to look at it his way; he kills a guy who insulted a big man - he gets a reputation. He thinks he's in good standing.
TERESA: It's still sick.
CHARLIE: Not sick...just stupid. Speaking of stupid, your cousin last night was feeling so good he decided to break into your mother's house...to get some food.
