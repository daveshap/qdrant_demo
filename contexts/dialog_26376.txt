CLARK: Hey, he'll be all right. Believe me Lana, I know. I was a late bloomer myself.
LANA: It isn't only that he's small for his age. how would you like to be the only kid in town without a father? Look at him, he's stewed to the gills in the middle of the afternoon.

LANA: I mean him.
BRAD: Hiya, sweet thing. Little guy's getting' hassled, huh? Kent, you still here?
CLARK: I seem to be.
BRAD: All the kid needs is a couple of pointers from the ol' champ here. Kent, I bet you didn't know I won the all-country bowling trophy two years in a row.
CLARK: Uh, no, I didn't know that, Brad.
BRAD: A natural athlete can play any sport. Any sport.
