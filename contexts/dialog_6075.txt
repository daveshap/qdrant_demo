LELAND: Almost two to one -
EMILY: I'm surprised he got the votes he did.
LELAND: Emily!
EMILY: Why should anyone vote for him? He's made it quite clear to the people what he thinks of them. Children - to be told one thing one day, something else the next, as the whim seizes him. And they're supposed to be grateful and love and adore him - because he sees to it that they get cheap ice and only pay a nickel in the street cars.
LELAND: Emily, you're being - a little unfair - You know what I think of Charles' behavior - about your personal lives -
EMILY: There aren't any personal lives for people like us. He made that very clear to me nine years ago - If I'd thought of my life with Charles as a personal life, I'd have left him then -
LELAND: I know that, Emily -
EMILY: Maybe I should have - the first time he showed me what a mad dog he really was.
LELAND: Emily, you -
EMILY: Brad, I'm - I'm not an old woman yet -
LELAND: It's - all over -
EMILY: I know it is, Brad -
LELAND: He's paying for it, Emily. Those returns tonight - he's finished. Politically - - socially, everywhere, I guess. I don't know about the papers, but -
EMILY: If you're asking me to sympathize with him, Brad, you're wasting your time. There's only one person I'm sorry for, as a matter of fact. That - that shabby little girl. I'm really sorry for her, Brad.
BERNSTEIN: Hello, Mr. Leland.
LELAND: Hello, Bernstein.
LELAND: Where is it - where's my notice? I've got to finish it!
BERNSTEIN: Mr. Kane is finishing it.
LELAND: Kane? Charlie? Where is he?
LELAND: I suppose he's fixing it up - I know I'd never get that through.
BERNSTEIN: Mr. Kane is finishing your piece the way you started it.
