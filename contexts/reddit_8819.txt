Is there evidence to suggest the attempted Turkey coup was or wasn't staged?
Fethullah Gülen, who Erdoğan has blamed for the coup, said "There is a possibility that it could be a staged coup". His media advisor elaborated:

> The coup appears to be poorly planned, very poorly executed and everything seems to be playing into Erdoğan’s hands. There are many big question marks of how [this attempted coup] was executed.

While a lot of people in comment sections on the internet are liking the idea that it was staged, Dani Rodrik, a Turkish economist and international development expert at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government, writes:

> The coup attempt is very puzzling. For one thing, it seems to have been very poorly planned. For example, most TV channels were left operating and there does not seem to have been an attempt to take Erdogan in. And as I write this, it seemed to be collapsing. Second, it is not clear who would benefit from a coup. The military is no longer the secularist stronghold with a strong esprit de corps and sense of mission it once was. (Hence the widespread theory in Turkey that this was a coup staged by Erdogan himself, designed to pave the way for an Erdogan dictatorship. But this doesn’t quite ring true either, in light of Erdogan’s recent attempts to mend fences with Russia and Israel to strengthen the economy. He must know that even a failed coup would wreak havoc with the economy.)
