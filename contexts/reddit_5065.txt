Accepted offer letter and got hired, but just received email they’re looking for other candidates?
I’m quite stressed at the moment because I received an email from a recent job I was hired at that they’re looking for different candidates. I’ve already did the face to face interview (not to toot my own horn, but I think I did fabulous), passed the drug test, accepted the job offer and filled out an I-9 form.

 I don’t understand why they would email me that I don’t have the job anymore after they LITERALLY hired me and had me fill out all of the paperwork. Has anybody had this experience before? 

I’m so worried that I’m sweating and can’t think straight. This is the best paying job/ career I’ve ever been offered and now it’s been ripped right out of my hands.
