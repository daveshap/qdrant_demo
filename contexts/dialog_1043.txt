BILL: Maybe just a little around the edges.
LLOYD: - it's Addison, from start to finish, it drips with his brand of venom... taking advantage of a kid like that, twisting her words, making her say what he wanted her to say-
KAREN: Where'd you get all that information?
LLOYD: Eve.
KAREN: Eve?
LLOYD: She's been to see me, as a matter of fact she left just before you came in - you just missed her...
KAREN: That was a pity...
LLOYD: She wanted to explain about her interview, wanted to apologize to someone - and didn't dare face Margo...
KAREN: I wonder why.
