NICHOLAS: I need your car, Elizabeth.
ELIZABETH: What happened to you, Nick? I mean, look at yourself...
NICHOLAS: I know, look at me, well... What happened? I don't know. I don't even really know. I have some things to try to take care of... I need the car a little while.
ELIZABETH: Of course you can have it if you need it. Can I get you something to eat?
