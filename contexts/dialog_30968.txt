CHRISTY: Ted, have you lost your mind?
TED: You like me. I like you. I guess it's pretty obvious to everyone.
CHRISTY: I don't LIKE you. We're JUST FRIENDS.
TED: But that smile.
CHRISTY: Oh, Ted, DUH. I smile at everyone since I got my braces off.
TED: So you'll think about it?
CHRISTY: You really don't get it, do you? I am genetically programmed to desire a big, buff, manly man who can defend and provide for me and my yet to be conceived offspring! It's, like, a caveman thing!
TED: So that's a maybe?
CHRISTY: The answer is NEVER, Ted, NEVER. Except maybe in your dreams.
