WADE: I'm sorry for the screw-up. But I couldn't help it it's too late to go trick-or-treating now. I couldn't help it I had to stop at Penny's for the costume. And you were hungry, remember.
JILL: Who's fault is it then if it's not yours? You're the one in charge, Daddy.
WADE: Yeah.
JILL: Look. Those kids are still trick-or- treating. They're still out.
WADE: Those are the Hoyts.
JILL: I don't care. They're out.
WADE: Can't you see... look out there. Nobody's got their porch lights on anymore. It's too late. Those Hoyt kids are just out to get in trouble. See, they put shaving cream all over that mailbox there. They chopped down Herb Crane's new bushes. Little bastards. Jesus H. Christ.
JILL: Why do they do that?
WADE: Do what?
JILL: You know.
WADE: Break stuff?
JILL: Yeah. It's stupid.
WADE: I guess they're stupid.
JILL: Did you do that when you were a kid?
WADE: Well, yeah. Sort of. Nothing really mean. Me and my pals, me and my brothers. It was kind of funny then. Stealing pumpkins, soaping windows. Stuff like that.
JILL: Was it funny?
WADE: To us it was.
JILL: But it's not funny now.
WADE: It's not funny now. I'm a cop and I gotta listen to all the complaints people make. I'm not a kid anymore. You change.
JILL: I bet you did lots of bad things.
WADE: What are you talking about?
JILL: I just think you used to be bad.
WADE: No. I didn't used to be bad. No sir. Where do you get this stuff? From your mother?
JILL: No. She doesn't talk about you anymore.
LARIVIERE: We're looking for the funniest costume! And the scariest! And the most imaginative! And the best costume of all!
WADE: Got here just in time. Go ahead. Jump in line. Maybe you'll win a prize.
WADE: Go on, Jill. Some of those kids you still know.
JILL: I don't want to.
WADE: Why? Why not? You know these kids from when you went to school here. It hasn't been that long.
JILL: It's not that.
WADE: What then?
JILL: It's stupid.
WADE: It's fun.
JILL: I want to go home. I don't like it here.
WADE: Oh, Jesus, come on, will you? Don't mess this up anymore than it's already been messed up. Join the other kids. Do that and before you know it you'll be as happy as a goddamned clam.
