JABEZ: Mary -- what would you do with a pot o' gold?
MARY: Jabez!
JABEZ: Mary -- what would you do?
MARY: Well -- I -- I don't know -- I would pay our debts and well -- maybe get a new bonnet, but -- really -- I think I would live the same.
JABEZ: Mary -- look! Hessian gold. I found it in the barn.
MA STONE: You found it in the barn, hey?
JABEZ: Yes -- I was getting the seed -- I stumbled -- I saw one of the boards warped up a bit -- and -- there it was.
MA STONE: Most outlandish thing I ever heard tell. Don't seem right, somehow!
JABEZ: But it's true. Take 'em up in your hands, Mary -- feel 'em -- they're real all right. Aren't you glad?
MARY: I'll try hard -- I just can't take it all in.
MA STONE: H'm. Hessian gold. Well -- hope it'll do us more good than it did the Hessians.
