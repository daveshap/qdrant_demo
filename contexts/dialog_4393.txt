PATRICK: Did you do it?
JEREMIAH: Sure, son. I went down there and torched the place myself.
PATRICK: You could have had it done. You didn't want us there.
JEREMIAH: I wouldn't have risked killing you to get you out. I was trying to protect you.
PATRICK: From what?
PATRICK: Why? Why did you give a shit about the building? Why did you care that we were there of all places?
JEREMIAH: It's...it's a bad neighborhood. As you can see now.
PATRICK: Bullshit, Dad. Don't front me. For once. Just tell me the truth. I came from there, too.
JEREMIAH: You were just a kid.
PATRICK: I saw your face. You knew that place. You knew those people.
JEREMIAH: That's the past. It's dead.
PATRICK: Dead? I don't think your past is dead. It's alive. And it bites.
STANK: Looking to score?
BONES: Unh-unh, little brother. I got a natural high. A supernatural high.
STANK: Hey, Eddie Mack don't like no wackos on his street. Go be Rain Man on some other bitch's block.
BONES: Big Bad Eddie Mack? Got shit for brains and that's a fack. Hey-heh...
