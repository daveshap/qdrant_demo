ALICE: They think I'm nuts.
MARK: That's their problem.
ALICE: No, it's our problem, Mark. If I don't deal with this, they really might try to take Jacob. You said she committed suicide?
MARK: That's what the newspapers thought. She spent the rest of her life in the asylum. After Krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought.
ALICE: Meaning?
MARK: They couldn't prove it. No body! Nuns bumping themselves off is bad for business.
ALICE: But I've seen her grave.
MARK: Empty plot. Memorial stone. Vacant. They never did put her under. Cool, huh?
ALICE: Poor woman...
MARK: No shit.
ALICE: I don't understand.
MARK: She killed herself. Her soul's gonna be in torment.
