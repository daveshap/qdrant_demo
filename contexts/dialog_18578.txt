NICK: What do you mean by weird"?"
ALEX: Greg never came home. A few hours is one thing, Nick, but this is different. Something's happened to him.
ALEX: Can you turn off the game?
NICK: I'm in the middle of it...
ALEX: Turn if off!
NICK: Happy?
ALEX: No. Look, I know you're not going to believe me, but listen anyway... I think the game's alive somehow.
ALEX: No, wait. Just listen. I hooked it up earlier tonight, and it said my name. As soon as I turned it on, Nick. It said my name. How could it know? And then, I asked it where Greg was, and it said, In here"."
NICK: Alex, I think you're freaking out. Greg's gone, I'll give you that. And maybe he's in trouble. But it's not ARCADE that's doing it...
ALEX: It is.
NICK: How?! It's a machine, Alex. Machine's don't think. They're not alive. It's a good program, a brilliant program, it was designed so it would act as if it were alive, but it's not alive.
ALEX: So how did it know my name, then?
NICK: You imagined it.
ALEX: See, men always do this. Quiet down
NICK: Quiet. I do have parents, you know.
