What would be the best way for a teenager to start his own business without money in beginning?
I know a teenager who had a few Play store translating jobs, and I am not sure, but he got about hundred bucks for doing it.

However, today he asked me how could he make himself proud, educated and successful without startup money?

Any advices? I am interested in this.
