No call no show
I accidentally didn't go to work today it's been four hours since my schedule and my manager called me two hours after my start time yet I didn't pick the phone up because I honestly thought they wanted me to cover someone else's shift, thinking it was my day off but I got suspicious and checked my schedule and it turns out I'm off tomorrow not today. Should I call him now? I'm a little buzzed ATM hence why I never called and I am asking you guys. FUCK I fucked up. It's only a min wage job but still I never do this. And I just started working for this company 6 months ago
