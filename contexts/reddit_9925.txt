Bystander Intervention resources?
I run the bystander intervention program at my university and I'm having trouble finding new and updated resources that aren't geared towards children and teens. Any suggestions?

EDIT: Our program is based off of the Step Up! program, so we have a lot of that information already.

Thanks!
