BARBARA: Oh, doesn't that prove something to you? Doesn't it?
MRS. FARREN: Anybody could know that song.
BARBARA: Look at me. Look at me, mother darling. Look into my eyes. What color eyes did Barbara have?
MRS. FARREN: Gray. They were a lovely, lovely gray.
BARBARA: And my eyes...my eyes are gray. Look! You see!
MRS. FARREN: Yes...yes, that's true.
BARBARA: And my hair...what color hair did Barbara have?
MRS. FARREN: It was pale...a shadowed gold.
