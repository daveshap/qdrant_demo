NINOTCHKA: She is very attractive. She has great elegance. She's what you call a woman of the world, isn't she?
LEON: Ninotchka, I love you.
NINOTCHKA: I suppose she is very entertaining... It must be lots of fun to be with her, so witty, so glamorous...
LEON: Ninotchka, you're jealous.
NINOTCHKA: Leon, don't ever ask me for a picture of myself... I couldn't bear the thought of being shut up in a drawer... I couldn't breathe, I couldn't stand it.
LEON: My darling.
HEADWAITER: Good evening, Your Highness.
SWANA: Good evening, Louis. You seem to be very crowded tonight. Can you manage a table near the floor?
HEADWAITER: Certainly, Your Highness, this way please... Count d'Algout made the reservation this afternoon.
SWANA: Count d'Algout...
HEADWAITER: It is only a small table but it will be no trouble to put in some extra chairs.
