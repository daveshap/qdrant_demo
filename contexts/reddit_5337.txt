Telemarketing - How to deal with being cursed out on a daily basis
So, I landed a new job and it's comparable to telemarketing. I'm not the greatest salesperson (i'm working on my aggressiveness), but I can land a few sales per day which averages to about $17-20 per hour.

Does anyone here do this or have done this in the past? 

If so, do you have any advice for confidence/angry customers?
