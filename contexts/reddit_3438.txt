I hate dating because it's one aspect of my life I have no control over
At least from a guys perspective, men in society are told early in their life that accomplishments make them desirable.

When you're young, it's easy to understand life trajectory that makes you desirable through accomplishments:

For me it was:

1. Do well in High School, so that you can...
2. Go to College, do well in college so that you can...
3. Get a job (or get a Masters--my path), so that you can
4. Get a better job in the city
5. ??????????????   \[This step is where I am right now\]

Now that I actually have an office job that I enjoy, now what? 

I know I want to meet someone, but it's not a straightforward path. There isn't like a list of steps for me to complete to guarantee that I will find someone. As someone that's driven by accomplishments that's the hardest thing about dating. You truly have no control over making someone like you--as we all know, being nice doesn't guarantee attraction.
