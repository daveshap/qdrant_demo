Does this guy really like me or is he just friendly?
So there’s this guy at my school, he can literally go up to a random person and talk to them with no problem at all and that’s how we became friends. He has a lot of friends and a lot of the girls like him, he’s not a fboy or anything he’s usually nice to me and friendly. We are in a sport together (practice is usually when we see each other in school) and he would ask to be my partner for the warmups and stuff. He also stays around me more than his other female friends. He knows alot of people liked him and can be a little self absorbed sometimes. A few days ago he asked if i liked him, i pretty sure he asked just so he can boost his ego and stuff so idk if i should tell him or not :/// i feel like he’s just gonna laugh it off and continue being friends
