MARIAN: I just can't seem to focus on anything these days.
PAULA: That's why it's good you came to visit me.
MARIAN: How are you doing sweetheart?
PAULA: I'm good.
MARIAN: Dating anyone?
PAULA: No, I'm working too much, I don't have time.
MARIAN: What about the fellow in those pictures?
PAULA: What pictures?
MARIAN: You know ... ... whoops!
PAULA: Mother!
MARIAN: Well, they were right out in plain view.
PAULA: Behind the books.
MARIAN: But I was dusting.
PAULA: I was seeing Aaron and there were some ... complications.
MARIAN: He seemed quite taken with you.
PAULA: I don't want to talk about it.
MARIAN: You know, you never tell me anything.
PAULA: That's not true. Besides, I don't want you dusting. I want you to see New York.
