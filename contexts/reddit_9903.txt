Graduating my HESA program early & the job market
Hi all. I'm trying to decide whether to graduate early from my Higher Education/Student Affairs masters program. I have 3 classes left and work full-time in the field. I could either cram all 3 classes into the fall semester and graduate early, or I could save one class for the spring semester and graduate in May. I'm wondering if it could be advantageous in the job market to graduate off-cycle (in December, when there are theoretically fewer new grads looking for work). 

I am currently working in the subfield of student affairs that I want to stay in, but I want to move to another institution. I'm in a pretty competitive region and an area of the field that it seems like lots of people want to work in. The last time my department had an open position, we had over 200 applicants and only interviewed 4 of them. So, basically I'm worried about my chances of even getting an interview if I look for another position.

Am I wrong in thinking I might have a better chance in the job market if I graduate early? Enough so to make it worth going through a brutal semester? Compared to what my colleagues say about the HESA programs they graduated from, mine seems a lot more rigorous, but I think I could handle the extra-heavy workload for one semester. I would really appreciate any opinions. Thanks!
