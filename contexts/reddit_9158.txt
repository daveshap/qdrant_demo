Just an observation at a job with part time and full time hourly employees.
I know for a lot of people this is a given but I work an hourly job and I am still surprised by some of the snap judgements that I hear. There are always a handful of people who are trying to get work as much as they can, they will make themselves as available as possible and try and cover shifts for other people as much as possible. They often aren’t shy about how they need money and might not be in the best place at the time. 

What shocks me is when they aren’t able to take a shift I’ll hear chatter about how “they must not actually need money that much” or “they have their nails done/are drinking Starbucks/etc. so obviously their financial situation isn’t that bad.”

What people don’t always realize is maybe this person hasn’t had a weekend day off in months. Maybe this person has a significant milestone that day. Maybe this person was given a Starbucks gift card and couldn’t sell it. Maybe their nails are always done because that’s the once a month get together they have with their mom and she pays for it. 

I get where the skepticism comes from but it’s always important to remember things aren’t what they seem, and people deserve to have days reserved to be off no matter what their financial situation is. You never know the backstory to everything so be kind. Assuming the worst doesn’t help anyone in these situations. 

I’m sorry if this is redundant to you. I just needed to get this off my chest and I hope that it may help somebody out there.
