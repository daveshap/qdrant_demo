MARY: Who is it?
FRANK: Frank.
MARY: Come on up.
FRANK: He's dead, Rose. Your father passed.
ROSE/MARY: How can that be? He was getting better.
FRANK: He coded. They shocked him one too many times. I'm sorry.
ROSE/MARY: He was tough. You did all you could.
FRANK: I'm sorry.
ROSE/MARY: You have to keep the body going until the brain and heart recover enough to go on their own.
ROSE/MARY: Would you like to come in?
FRANK: Yes.
GERALD: I don't know a recent Saturday I've sold more. You didn't think I'd sell that health restaurant, did you?
TOM: No. Not even you.
GERALD: Why so glum?
TOM: I don't know.
GERALD: Go ahead.
TOM: No, nothing. I've got a problem, I guess.
GERALD: Were you bothering by those waitresses making a fuss?
TOM: No. But, honest. What are you supposed to say when they keep talking about your looks? I don't even know what they mean -- Beat them off with a stick.""
GERALD: You know, Tom, I feel a little proud when people comment on your looks. Maybe you should feel that way.
TOM: Proud? I'm just embarrassed that I like when they say those things.
GERALD: As long as that's your only problem you're...
TOM: It's not.
TOM: I got my report card. Three Cs, two Ds and an incomplete.
GERALD: Oh my. I see you studying so hard, Tom. What do you think the problem is?
TOM: I'll just have to try harder. I don't know. I will. I will. I will. I will.
TOM: Thanks, Dad, this talk helped. Will you sign it, please?
GERALD: Would it help if I got you a tutor?
TOM: That would be great. It better help. What can you do with yourself if all you do is look good?
