Is it me or getting a job is really hard getting a job
Graduated last year in Computer Science and GIS from a good college. Applying heaps of jobs from January till today and all I got is a "Thank you for applying, unfortunately.." response of rejection letter.

Even in January it is already difficult to even get a job, now with the coronavirus and recession I felt like this is like playing life on hard mode. Sorry If you gotta read this, I just gotta rent on my thoughts for being unemployed for way too long. For anyone who is on the same boat as me, let's hope the best will come.

Edit: thank you for so many kind words and tips, also I should've mention that I live in a small city in New Zealand and job itself is already quite limited. So now in the meantime, I'm improving my portfolio and thinking of doing some sort of freelancing.
