Looks absolutely matter, more than you think
I'm tired of the men/women that think they're high and mighty when they say "yeah looks arent that important, I want a guy that can make me laugh and make me smile"

Its bullshit. Lifting weights for just under a year has made life so fucking better for me.

Not just casual dating, but life in general. People glow around me. They open up and they treat me better. I get invited to events and I have much better conversations with the people around me. 

I have had girls actually approach me. The whole "girls dont approach men" thing is bullshit I've come to find. 

You want to improve your dating life? Hit the gym and lift. Lift and dont stop until you've got a damn good body.
