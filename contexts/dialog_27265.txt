SCULLY: He didn't mention a park.
MULDER: This is where he marked on the map, Scully. Where he says those fossils were unearthed.
SCULLY: I don't see any evidence of an archeological or any other kind of digsite. Not even a sewer or a storm drain.
MULDER: You're sure the fossils you looked at showed the same signs of deterioration you saw in the fireman's body in the morgue?
SCULLY: The bone was porous, as if the virus of the causative microbe were digesting it.
MULDER: And you've never seen anything like that?
SCULLY: No. It didn't show up on any of the immunohistochemical tests --
MULDER: This looks like new grass to you?
SCULLY: It looks pretty green for this climate.
MULDER: Ground's dry about an inch down. Somebody just laid this down. Very recently, I'd say.
SCULLY: All the equipment is brand new.
MULDER: No irrigation system. Somebody's covering their tracks.
