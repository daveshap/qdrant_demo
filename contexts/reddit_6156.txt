Accepted job - drug test?
Hello! I’ve recently accepted a job and I start (remotely) tomorrow and they haven’t said anything about drug testing yet. Does this mean I’m most likely in the clear or should I continue to abstain as they might spring it on me once we all go back to work in office? 

Dont they have to tell you that they drug test before you accept the job? This is in New York State (but not city). Only worried about THC, but I’ve been abstaining so far just in case.
