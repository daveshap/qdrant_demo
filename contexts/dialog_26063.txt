LENNY: He's been cooked-off
MAX: Is he dead?
LENNY: No. But his frontal lobes are like two runny eggs. They put an amplifier in-line to boost the signal till it french-fried his brain.
LENNY: He's totally cut off from the outer world.
MACE: How long does it last? Oh.
MAX: Those two psycho cops are on a slash-and-burn to find the tape and cover their tracks.
MACE: This seems a little sophisticated for them. These are not subtle guys.
MAX: There's more to this whole thing than you think.
LENNY: Whattya mean?
MAX: All I'm saying... you don't know how high up the food chain this thing goes. I've heard stuff.
LENNY: What stuff?
MAX: Smoke. Rumors. I've heard stuff about a death squad. A group a guys loyal to the hardline school. Guys that've had too many years of city hall and the review boards and the goddamn media pissing down their necks, suspending cops right and left, tying their hands... while outa the other side a their mouths these same people're squealing save us, save us, do something you fucking morons, crime is totally out of control.
LENNY: Jesus.
MAX: Yeah. So don't walk near me in public, alright.
LENNY: Thanks, buddy. See... things weren't bad enough. They weren't fucking bad enough!
MACE: The only card we have to play is the tape. You know, we get it to the media somehow...
LENNY: Yeah, right, blow it open.
MAX: Mace... no disrespect... but you run this on the 11 o'clock news, by midnight you got the biggest riot in history. They'll see the fucking smoke from Canada.
LENNY: Okay... what about Strickland?
MAX: No. Bad idea.
MACE: Who's Strickland?
LENNY: Deputy Commissioner Palmer Strickland. The sanctimonious prick who busted me out. His ass is so tight when he farts only dogs can hear it. I know this guy. If there's one cop who's not dirty it's him.
