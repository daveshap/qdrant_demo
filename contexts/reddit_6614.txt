Has anyone worked for a small family corporation?
I had a second interview for a position as an Operations Coordinator at a small brokerage company. Things are looking very hopeful, as they've mentioned that I am the strongest candidate so far. I actually prefer smaller companies because in my experience it's more of a "human" work environment. That being said, there is something interesting about this company that I'm not sure will be a positive or a negative down the road.

The CEO is an older lady with no husband / kids. There are three other employees, all of whom are related to the CEO (I believe they are her nephews). She plans on retiring in 5 ~ 6 years, leaving the company in her nephews' hands while she oversees from retirement every now and then. I interviewed with all the employees present and they seemed decent enough.

That being said, I've never worked for a company that was run by family members. It's definitely interesting, as I don't really know what to expect in terms of workplace dynamics at such an environment. Because there are so few employees though, there are some nice perks like catered lunch everyday and a company lunch outing once a week. They also seem fairly lax about PTO and personal appointments. With all that in mind, I would love to hear first-hand experiences and guidance!
