As someone tasked with setting up interviews, I have some resume advice.
ALWAYS keep it to one page. I feel like this should go without saying, but you would be shocked by what some people submit. Make sure everything is aligned, put only relevant and/or recent experience. We have people putting down positions they had for a few weeks in the 90's!

From a hiring standpoint, keep it brief. If anyone is not confident, I'd be happy to post a sample (fictional of course) or look over resume's PM'd to me.

EDIT: I'm gonna step up and apologize here. In my experience multiple pages is too much. I personally am hiring entry level, intern level, and general administrative positions. I personally don't have enough experience or knowledge to comment on upper management and science based positions.
