EMIL: So...who's Nicky?
EDDIE: What do you want?
EMIL: Your opinion. You see, they going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie. And write books.
EDDIE: What's your accomplishment.
EMIL: I kill someone famous.
EDDIE: Then do it, asshole.
EMIL: Good - be tough to the end. Actor who plays you will want to die like hero.
EMIL: So tabloids don't have to do re enactments. They going to have real movie this time.
EDDIE: If you kill me and film it you're putting a noose around your neck.
