Why aren't military generals/leaders serious presidential candidates anymore?
The last general we had in office was Eisenhower. LBJ and Nixon were both commanders in the second world war. Every president since Eisenhower has served except for Clinton and Obama, yet none of them were higher ranking than commander, with several being [low ranking officers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_Presidents_by_military_rank). What caused the shift away from military leaders being the commander in chief and how favorably would a general or other high ranking officer be viewed?
