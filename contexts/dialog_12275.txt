J.D.: You going to pull a Big Gulp with that?
VERONICA: No, but if you're nice I'll let you buy me a Slurpee. You know your 7-11speak pretty well.
J.D.: I've been moved around all my life; Dallas, Baton Rouge, Vegas, Sherwood Ohio, there's always a 7-11. Any town, any time, I can pop a Ham and Cheese in the microwave and feast on a Big Wheel. Keeps me sane.
VERONICA: Really? That thing in the caf today was pretty severe.
J.D.: The extreme always makes an impression, but you're right, it was severe. Did you say a Cherry or Coke Slurpee?
VERONICA: I didn't. Cherry.
