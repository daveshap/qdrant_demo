SYLVIA: They're coming. Any minute.
TRUMAN: Who?
SYLVIA: They're going to stop me talking to you.
TRUMAN: There's no one here.
SYLVIA: Just listen. You remember when you were a little boy, you stood up in class and said you wanted to be an explorer like Magellan--
TRUMAN: --How do you know about that?
SYLVIA: --And your teacher said, You're too late
TRUMAN: Were you there--how do you know?
SYLVIA: --It doesn't matter. Everybody knows about it. They know everything you do. The point is, you got scared.
TRUMAN: I don't understand.
SYLVIA: You must listen. Everybody's pretending, Truman.
