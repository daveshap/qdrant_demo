Leaving underemployed job with benefits for graduate school.
I’m currently enrolled as a full-time student at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism for Fall 2020. I currently have excellent Empire Blue Cross/Blue Shield coverage through my job as a teaching assistant. Once I leave, I will not have health insurance unless I pay the astronomical amount for KOBRA. Newmark J-School doesn’t currently offer its student’s health insurance. 

I’ve gotten a lot of advice that I would qualify for Medicaid. However, I only made $23, 707 last year according to my 1040 and will have made roughly half of that once I resign this year. This would put me above the bracket for Medicaid. After doing research through NYS Marketplace, I learned about the NYS Essential Plan that I feel like I’d qualify for. When I reached out to healthcare.gov and the NYS Health site to talk about options, they said that they would only be able to see what I qualify for once I lose coverage.

Does anybody have any suggestions or know about qualifications for the NYS Essential Plan?
