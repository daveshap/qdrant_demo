The apps are wearing me down
So I matched with a guy on Tinder last night and we talked for like 3, 4 hours. It was a good conversation IMO, and toward the end of it I asked if he wanted to meet this week and he said he could do Friday. We continued talking on and off today, just general chatting because I was working but I wasn't unresponsive. I just went to message him and see how his night's going and saw that he unmatched me.

I'm not looking for an explanation as to why; I know I won't get one and it could be a million things. I know it was just a few hours but it seemed like we have a lot in common and have similar senses of humor, and I was excited about the date. 

The carelessness people treat each other with on dating apps is just so frustrating and these tiny rejections are starting to wear me down. I took a 5-month break from OLD at the beginning of this year and think I might need another one.

Edit: Probably should have mentioned this to begin with but want to add that this feeling is the culmination of 10 years of being on apps on-and-off and watching people get less and less considerate as time goes by. This particular incident isn't an isolated one; it's something similar happens more often than not when I match with someone. This isn't me trying to say anyone owes me anything if we haven't even gone out yet, but it's hard not to get bogged down by it.

Also I've asked guys out after just a few messages and then had them turn out to be racist/sexist/homophobic/etc. I'd rather waste a few hours chatting online and getting to know them a bit than actually spend the time getting ready for a date and the money on drinks only to find out they're a piece of shit ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
