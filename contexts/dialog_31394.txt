CRABTREE: He has a book.
GRADY: I know. He started it Fall semester.
CRABTREE: He finished it Winter Break.
CRABTREE: So. Is he any good?
GRADY: No. Not yet he isn't.
CRABTREE: Well, I'm going to read it anyway.
GRADY: Come on. Crabs. Don't do this. He's one of my students, for Christ sake. I'm not even sure if he's --
CRABTREE: He is. Take my word for it.
GRADY: I think it's more complicated than that. Besides, he's a little... scattered. He almost... did something stupid tonight. At least, I think so. Anyway, he doesn't need sexual confusion thrown into the stew right now.
CRABTREE: On the contrary, it could be just the ticket.
