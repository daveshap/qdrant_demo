Can Brett Kavanaugh be charged with perjury?
In testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee yesterday, Brett Kavanaugh was asked about terms in his yearbook like “Devil’s Triangle” and “boofed”. He [explained](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/boofed-devils-triangle-ffffffourth-of-july-how-brett-kavanaugh-explained-yearbook-jokes/) that the former was a drinking game, and the latter a term for flatulence. 

The linked article from CBS News as well as the [definitions](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=boofed) on [Urban Dictionary](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Devils%20Triangle) seem to suggest otherwise. 

Additionally, according to [this article](https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_5ba020f6e4b013b0977defff) by former Senator Russ Feingold, this would not be the first time he has lied under oath. Feingold states that Kavanaugh lied during his 2006 confirmation hearing to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. circuit. So my question is, can a judicial nominee be charged with perjury based on statements made during their confirmation hearing?
