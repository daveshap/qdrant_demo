BUZZ: I got suspended when I was young, too. I was pretty cocky in my day.
THEO: They suspended me for 100 years.
BUZZ: 100 years!
THEO: I can appeal in five. I was hoping you could help me Mr. Fazeli.
BUZZ: What do you think I can do?
THEO: I need a sponsor to get my sanction card back. Where I come from, you're the king.
BUZZ: Sure, around here, any fat old bald guy could be king. I'm nothing. It wouldn't do any good for me to talk to the Congress. Hey, you thirsty? You like orange whips?
THEO: I've never had orange whips, I'm from Akron.
MILLIE: He's the guy Buzz.
BUZZ: He's not the guy, Millie. Just whip the whips.
MILLIE: I looked in his car. He's got pictures of you, clippings, maps.
BUZZ: Bowlers don't go around killing other bowlers. He's only a fan, Millie. I'll give him some tips and an autograph and he's outta here.
MILLIE: You're in trouble, aren't you Buzz? You're doing something dangerous in that alley.
BUZZ: Millie, I know what I'm doing.
MILLIE: We should leave this town. I can't take this anymore. I'm not gonna let him kill you in my house.
THEO: Remember the finals in Akron in '59? You had a seven-ten split in the final frame.
BUZZ: Yeah, against that prick VanDeMark.
THEO: Ten thousand to one, but you pegged it. The toughest shot on the last frame.
BUZZ: That game was before you was born.
THEO: My mom was there. She told me about it. The 'Fazeli Split.'
