SONNY: Hello. Hello, Leon.
LEON: Hello, Sonny.
SONNY: How are you doing?
LEON: Well... I'm out of the hospital.
SONNY: Yeah. You said... I thought you were never getting out?
LEON: I never thought I'd get out this way. I'll tell you.
SONNY: Well.... huh ...
LEON: Ooohh....
SONNY: Oh... huh ... how you feeling?
LEON: I'm really shakey.
SONNY: Well, you know ... Moretti told me before that you were drugged up.
LEON: Yeah. It was terrible.
SONNY: That... huh... they just shoot you with drugs.
LEON: You come in and they say, right away, that you are crazy. And they start putting things in your arm... you know. How do they expect you to get uncrazy if you're asleep all the time?
SONNY: Yeah...
LEON: You can't talk or do anything. You really feel... you know... I'm just sort of coming out of it now.
SONNY: So... that sure is something.
LEON: Yeah. So how are you?
SONNY: Fine, thank you. I'm in trouble. That is... now I am!
LEON: Yeah... I know.
SONNY: I don't know what I'm gonna do... you know. Boy... I'm dying.
LEON: What? What are you talking about? You are dying? Did you ever listen to yourself when you say that?
SONNY: What are you talking about?
LEON: What do you mean... what am I talking about? Do you realize that you say that to me every day of your life? I am dying. Do you know... do you realize the death that you are spreading around to the people who are around you?
SONNY: Now don't give me that deep shit now. Don't start with that shit.
LEON: No really... I don't think that you realize what it means. The things that you do, Sonny. You put a gun to somebody's head...
SONNY: I don't know what I'm doing.
LEON: Yeah... obviously you don't... when you put a gun to somebody's head... and you say go to sleep so that it won't hurt when I pull the trigger. Death? Don't talk about death to me. I have been living with death for the last six months. Why do you think I'm in the hospital? I take a handful of pills to get away from you. And then here I am out of the hospital talking to you on the phone... again. I have no friends left. No job. I can't live. I have to live with people. This death business... I'm sorry!
SONNY: I'm not on the phone to talk to you about that. Well, I don't know what to say, Leon. When you gimme that... when you hit me with that shit. I mean, what am I supposed to say?
LEON: I'm sorry...
SONNY: I told you. That I got a lot of pressures. You said to me that you needed money, and I knew that you needed money! I saw you there lying in the hospital like that... and I said... shit, man, I got to get this guy some money.
LEON: But I didn't ask you to go rob a bank.
SONNY: All right. I know you didn't ask me. You didn't ask me but I did it.
LEON: Well...
SONNY: I did it on my own. I did this all on my own. I ain't laying it on anybody. Nothing on anybody. I'll tell you something, though, it's about time that I squared away my accounts... you know. I am squaring away my accounts with life. Maye this whole thing is gonna end, somehow. Maybe it'll just end! Maybe I'll just close my eyes and the whole fucken thing will be over. That would be all right too! I said... I thought I would square it away with you... you know? That I would get you down here and that I would say so long to you... or, if you wanted... you know, to take a trip...
LEON: What trip?
SONNY: I'm getting out of here, man. I'm not going to stay here and I'm not giving up. I mean, huh, they're going to kill me, anyway. So fuck it! But, if I can get out of this... I am going to get out. And, how I'm going to do it is to get a jet out of here and I'm flying the fuck out... That's all, Leon. If you want to come with me, then you're entitled... you can come. You're free to do what you want.
LEON: I'm free to do what I want? And you think I would want to go with you some place on a plane? Where? Where ya going?
SONNY: I gotta jet coming here and we're gonna try to get the fuck outta this thing. And we're gonna go, man!
LEON: You're crazy.
SONNY: That's it.
LEON: You're really crazy.
SONNY: I know!
LEON: Where you gonna go?
SONNY: Who the fuck knows? I think we're gonna go ... we worked it out to Algeria. So, I don't know. So I'll go to Algeria.
LEON: Why you going to Algeria?
SONNY: Huh ... I don't know. They got Howard Johnson's there. I don't know why the fuck I'm going there for.
LEON: Howard Johnson's... you're warped. You know that? You're really warped!
SONNY: I know that. I'm warped... I'm warped!
LEON: God, Algeria! Do you know there's a bunch of... they walk around there... God! People walk around with masks and things on their heads. They're a bunch of crazy people there.
SONNY: What am I supposed to do?
LEON: I don't know... you could have picked a better place.
SONNY: Denmark? Sweden?
LEON: I like that... yeah!
SONNY: Sal wanted to go to Wyoming. I told him it wasn't a country. We gotta get outta the country! To hell with a guy who doesn't know where Wyoming is. Okay. Can you imagine what kind of a shape I'm in?
LEON: So! Sal is with you?
SONNY: Sal? Yeah... Sal is with me.
LEON: Oh... wow! Sonny, you're really into one mess now.
SONNY: I know I am. I know!
LEON: Sal... Sal... Naturale, oh boy!
SONNY: He ain't going out. And if I go out he's just gonna kill the people. There's a lot of lives that I'm responsible for... that's all. So, I can't do anything. I got myself into this mess and I'll get myself out of it... the best way I know how! One of the ways is not giving up. I'm telling ya!
LEON: Would you do something for me? Please?
SONNY: What?
LEON: These guys that got me down here, you know, huh... they think that I'm part of this whole thing. They think I'm part of the plot to rob the bank!
SONNY: How did they think that? What are they... crazy? What do you mean. That's bullshit, Leon. They're giving you a fucken story.
LEON: Well... they told me that I was an accomplice...
SONNY: Oh... they're fucken crazy. That's a snow job. Don't listen to that shit!
LEON: I gotta listen to it if they think...
SONNY: Shit...
LEON: I can't survive in prison, Sonny...
SONNY: All right. Then what do you want me to say?
LEON: Sonny, would you please just tell them... please...
SONNY: Where are they now? Just tell me... are they on the phone now?
LEON: Yeah.
SONNY: That's great. Just terrific. You talk to me with them on the phone, right? That is really smart. And, you don't tell me?
LEON: I don't have a choice.
SONNY: You don't have a choice?
LEON: No! They're standing all around me. Seven thousand fucken cops... all around me.
SONNY: Look... who's on the phone?
LEON: Look... don't throw that on me.
SONNY: Who's on the phone, now? What do you mean... throw it on you? You knew it, right?
LEON: Yeah... I knew it. But, what choice do I have? I'm in the hospital; they drag me out of the hospital... bring me down here...
SONNY: All right, enough! Who the fuck is on the phone... anyway? Is that you Moretti? You on the phone? Will somebody talk to me?
LEON: They won't talk to you.
SONNY: Are they on the phone still?
LEON: Yeah... yeah!
SONNY: All right! He didn't do it. All right? Now... would you get the fuck off the phone? I'll bet that really changed them, huh? Anyway, Leon... did I do it for you?
LEON: Yeah... huh, thank you. I'm going to go back, Sonny, to the hospital. They're really nice people. They're really trying to help me.
SONNY: That's good then. You've found something.
LEON: Well... I don't know if I have or not.
SONNY: Do you still want the operation?
LEON: Yeah... yeah.
SONNY: Well, then...
LEON: It's my only chance!
SONNY: I don't know what to say to ya! I guess I just wanted to say I'll see ya... or whatever.
LEON: Thank you much... and huh, bon voyage.
SONNY: Right. See you sometime.
LEON: Yeah... see ya in my dreams, huh?
SONNY: Yeah... I'll write a song. Ha, ha. I don't know. Life is funny!
LEON: You said a mouthful... sweetheart!
