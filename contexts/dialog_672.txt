ROSE: May I speak to you for a moment?
MARSHALL: Can't it wait?
ROSE: No, Mr. President. It can't.
ROSE: Don't. I know spin control when I feel it.
MARSHALL: Rose, I don't have time for this.
ROSE: For godsakes, Jim, slow down and stop acting like the little dutch boy. Not even you can plug all the world's leaks. Don't you think it's a sign you're pushing too hard when your daughter sees more of you on MTV news than in person.
MARSHALL: She's a big girl. She understands.
ROSE: How do you know she understands? You haven't spent more than five minutes with her, or me, in weeks.
MARSHALL: And when have I had five minutes? When I wake up in the morning and I'm already three hours behind Schedule. What do you want me to do, Rose, tell the G7 to fuck off because I'm a family man?
