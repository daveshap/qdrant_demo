I keep finding job ads that call the position "entry level", yet when you look at the description the job duties are clearly not.
For example one ad:

"We are looking for a full-time entry levelÂ Internal Audit Supervisor"

Since when is a supervisory role considered entry level? 

I suspect that some companies are slapping "entry level" on the job in order to justify paying less.

 Is this becoming a trend? Is anyone else coming across this?
