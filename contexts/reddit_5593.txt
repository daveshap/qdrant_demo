How do you deal with having a vastly lower skill level than your coworkers?
Mods if this is not allowed, feel free to delete.

Bit of background about me: 
Did my undergrad in Industrial Engineering in a 3rd world country. I worked for a couple months in manufacturing then moved to data analysis and then business analyst (3 different jobs) in 3 years.
I then decided to pursue a Masters in business analytics and big in europe.

I am now doing an internship in a big ecommerce company as an Analyst (includes business and data).

They have offered me a job as soon as the internship ends but I've been seriously considering not taking it, mostly because I feel so underskilled compared to my peers.

I linkedin stalked them and they're ALL cum laudes with CS backgrounds and consultants from very prestigious consultancy firms. Tableau, oracle and everything certified. Even before the stalking I could tell these guys were in another level.

I was very sincere since the initial interviews about my background and skills. I barely know SQL (which I learned in one of my previous jobs), and I've been struggling with stuff they do so easily. It's making me think I might not meet their expectations in the long run. It doesn't help we're the same age or they're younger than me.

I've dealt with Impostor Syndrome before and managed to convince myself that they hired me for a reason. But this time I'm really doubting myself if I belong here.

I don't want to go back to my country as the situation is not great and I'll probably feel as a failure if I do. I'm not getting any other offers anywhere and I'm having all these doubts about staying in this company.

So I guess I want advice on what might be the right move here, just stick with it? Try to swallow all my doubts and endure? 
If anyone has been in the same situation how did you manage it?

Any advice is very welcome.
