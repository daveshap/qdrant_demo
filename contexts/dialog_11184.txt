LT. ANDERSON: When we learned he could burrow his way through the tunnels we realized he could be out of the quarantined zone.
MAJOR HICKS: Christ. How many tunnels lead off the island?
LT. ANDERSON: Only five, Sir. We've checked them all. He hasn't used any of them.
MAJOR HICKS: Have them sealed off.
LT. ANDERSON: And how should we do that, Sir?
MAJOR HICKS: Fill them with cement, brick them up, put land mines in them, bombs, I don't know, just make sure that goddamned thing doesn't leave the island!
NICK: You know, he's not an enemy trying to evade you. He's just an animal.
MAJOR HICKS: What are you suggesting?
NICK: When I needed to catch earthworms, I knew the best way to catch them was not to chase them. I had to draw them out.
