Opinion: We're facing a generation of singles
Presenting my points as to why in the next decades, I believe that more and more people in the current young generation born 1990-2000+ will be single and unmarried in their 40s and 30s:

1. **Overchoice:** Scratching the 8 billion humans mark, you can just pull out tinder and get a pool of choices, compare and pick from any of them. There's just so many! Overchoice tricks us into not compromising. There's so much of 'the good stuff', *surely* you don't need to sacrifice your requirements, and there's always more fish in the sea, no bother fighting for a relationship!
2. **Social Media and Porn:** I've put these two in the same category. They both distort our view of potential partners, and over-sexualise our ideas of relationships. Important as well, they higher our standards. Your girl next door is neither an instagram model, or just your sweet sexual release. And a relationship is much more than something sexual, sexual attraction or infatuation, but we don't seem to think so these days.
3. **Mental Health:** This comes in with less force than the first two, but it also holds some weight to it. We are all notoriously depressed, it's a XXI century thing at this point. Instant gratification, addictions (to food, to social media, to youtube), porn, technology... they can be no good. But for whatever reasons you want, our declining mental health as a society is complicating relationships, turning them unhealthy and painful.

And for the above reasons, I believe our generation is doing quite a crappy job at dating, and many will enter their 30s quite single as a  â–³ . Please feel free to point out where you think I'm mistaken! happy to be wrong and change my mind(or try to be open minded, at least)!
