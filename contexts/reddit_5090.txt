55 year-old translator looking for a job
Hello,

My mother is a 55 year-old English/French translator working in France. I am coming here for help, because even though she has 20 years of experience in the field of translation, she also just went through her second bankruptcy - mostly because she couldn't manage the French tax system very well both times - and can't seem to find a new job to get back on her feet. 

Indeed, even though we worked together on making her a brand new CV showing her project coordination an translation skills, she has been struggling to find a job for a year now. So I have two questions about her situation:

1. What kind of job could she get as a translator with her age and experience (especially in France, but elsewhere in Europe or in any English speaking country is fine as well)?
2. How do you help someone who has lived through two bankruptcies become confident again about their professional skills?
