I don't know how to stop
I hate that I like making fun of people. 
I hate that I can't stop myself from mocking people. And I just don't know if I'm just going through a really bad rough spot or I'm just really fucking mentally broken. I really can't feel like I can live without making fun of people. Like I don't know what else to say. I really wanna stop and start living life without feeling the need to mock someone. Is there something wrong with me? Or am in just a bad person.
