Sudden change in noise levels This is real life issue I am having currently and I am puzzled as to why it happened. I posted the question in the engineering section but it was put on hold as too broad. I have no other way to narrow it down as it is a real life ongoing situation. I have lived over the subway lines (two actually each going in the opposite direction, two sets of tracks) for two years. The noise has always been a soft background hum, with an occasional louder train (that usually needs wheel maintenance), hardly noticeable. One early morning near the end of January I was jolted out of bed by a loud noise. Turns out it is the subway. It is as if someone turned the volume up from 3 to 8 overnight. Noise much louder (both tracks), last longer and there is shaking in the house too. Some small variances in the loudness of each train, but all much louder. The quietest train now is much loudest then the loudest one was before. I know that no changes were made to the tracks, trains, schedules or my building. What else could have caused it - noise from subway became much louder overnight? What could have changed the way sound travels between the tracks and my house?
