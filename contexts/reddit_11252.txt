I'm going deaf.
I have been diagnosed with a "retracted eardrum", which could mean Patulous Eustachian tube or Costen's syndrome, according to various doctors. I have an appointment to get a referral to a specialist next week.

It's a very frustrating experience. It feels like there's water in my ears, permanently, I constantly feel air whistling through my ears. I can't hear myself talk and I can barely carry a conversation. Sometimes it goes away for a few days at a time, and I feel normal. Then it comes back.
