CLAUDE: Did you go see my cousin Maynard like I asked you in my letter?
DAISY: Of course I did. He said he'd file an appeal right away. You didn't tell me he was so good looking.
CLAUDE: Yeah, that side of the family has all the looks and none of the brains. I hope he don't mess things up.
DAISY: He seemed like a pretty good lawyer to me. His offices take up an entire floor of that big, new building on 125th Street, and he was using all these words I never heard before. He even offered me a job.
CLAUDE: A job, huh? Well, that's nice, real nice. You won't have to work long. I'll be back soon enough. After I start work at First Federal Bank of Manhattan, I'll be keeping you in style. Everything will get back to normal again. That's a promise.
DAISY: Listen, Claude, Maynard wanted to know if he should file the appeal on behalf of your friend, too.
CLAUDE: Ray Gibson? No, no. He's the reason I'm in here, Daisy. For all I know, he's got a record a mile long. I got a better shot of getting out of here on my own. You tell Maynard to think about me, concentrate on me. Understand?
DAISY: Sure, Claude, whatever you say.
DILLARD: We lost yesterday on accounta the rain. That means we gotta make up for it today, so put your backs to it.
HOPPIN' BOB: You heard the boss! Let's move!
