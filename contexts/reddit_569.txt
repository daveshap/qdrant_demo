My art teacher gives me constant anxiety and makes me feel panicked. The years almost over but its becoming super hard to deal with
This was a year long class and its my last needed art credit but i seriously cant keep going. Ive had multiple breakdowns because of this class and im constantly anxious. Today was the worst when she took my sketchbook (the one i got myself like its actually mine) cuz she needs to grade it. She told me she told us this before but she didnt cuz nobody else knew.
Now im not gonna get it back and it just threw me over the edge and i had a breakdown in the bathroom. I know the yearâ€™s almost over but could i use mental health issues to drop this class? Coming to art throws off my whole day and i just cant cope with it anymore.
