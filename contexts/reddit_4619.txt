Dealing with parents who refuse to understand your depression?
I'm honestly so tired. I feel like a shitty child. They've been stressed out because of me. It makes me feel worse and I feel like there is no hope left. I can't snap out of it... I've tried to explain them but they refuse to understand.
This is an edit after A week: Guys... I told my dad about the severity after pursuing them... :') He will come to meet my doctor
