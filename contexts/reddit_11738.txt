I don't know what I want.
I'm typically a well-composed, well put together individual. I'm rarely sad or upset and even when I am, it's never very serious and has never lasted more than a few days in the worst cases. 

Lately, though, I've come to realize that a lot of what I'm doing is just treading water. Going through actions because they feel like what I should do, not because I actually want to or have a real reason to. I want to find some purpose in my life, but I feel like I have none right now. I have everything I want, which is much more than I need. I just don't have any goals left, it feels.

There are goals I SHOULD have, like getting through college, making it  to nationals in debate, etc. I just don't feel like they are worth the amount of effort I would give them if I focused on them. They feel too easy. 

Any suggestions?
