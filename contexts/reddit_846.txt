I went to groceries, i cleaned my appartment and I cooked myself a burger with potatoes for the first time in 3 months.
I just needed to tell anyone, I feel like I finally got my shit together for the first time in a long time.

Edit: holy sh, this thread blew up ! Didn't expect that. I can't respond to everyone but thanks a lot for your support guys ! I had a cool day at work today and some of your comments were really awesome, thanks a lot ! I'll keep on doing me-stuff and having me-time as much as I can, starting today. And thanks for the 2 medals lol
