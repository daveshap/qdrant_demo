Job off letter says I need to "acknowledge the company's drug test policy", does that mean pre-employment DT is imminent?
Yes we are concerned, and yes this is a learning experience.

Firstly, i've had numerous job offer letters from big companies where no where on the letter mentioned anything about drug tests or drug policy or even the 4-letter word "D-R-U-G".  In these cases i was not drug tested.

Last week, my friend received a offer letter and within the letter she was asked (amongst other things) that as condition of employment to "acknowledge" the companies' drug-free workplace and drug & alcohol testing policies.  Now we discussed that because the word DRUG is mentioned, she will get tested prior to starting.  But then she asked friends of hers who work at the company and they were never drug tested prior to employment (or after).

Our question is, how do companies that state drug-free language in their offer letters decide who to drug test?  Do they flip a coin? Or hey you're African American- drug test!

(A quick search shows some ppl were tested, some were not.  There were posts stating any major USA company will drug test you)
