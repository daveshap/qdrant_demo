I need help please
So I’m 16 and I met this girl through my friend. We haven’t met before, she lives 6 hours from me. We started talking and FaceTiming every night and basically falling in love. I just assumed she was 16 also but today I found out she’s 14. I don’t know what to do because it’s just awkward because we were planning to meet up some time but now it just seems weird.
