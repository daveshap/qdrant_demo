JACKIE: What's the lighthouse?
MIKE: It's an island, near here, with a lighthouse. We sometimes hang out there, you know....
JACKIE: Great. I got some wine.
BROOKE: The lighthouse is a make-out spot.
JACKIE: Now I really want to see it.
BROOKE: You going to fool around with Mike? Well, I'm not doing anything with him.
