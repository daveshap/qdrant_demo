ROLAND: Where's the power and radio setup?
LUDLOW: Operations building. Far end of the street.
NICK: Lava?
MALCOLM: No.
NICK: What are they?
MALCOLM: I don't know.
LUDLOW: The radio rig is inside. It runs directly from the geothermal generator, so power shouldn't be a problem.
ROLAND: Good.
MALCOLM: What's he got in there?
LUDLOW: Piss.
SARAH: What?
LUDLOW: Don't ask me. The guy's completely out to lunch.
