It's my 26th birthday today. I have severe BPD, I am alone, and my mom used my birthday card as a way to argue how BPD isn't caused by abuse and that she is a perfect angel who has never done anything wrong.
I got in a car crash a few weeks ago, I live in a small town, so I lost both my Job's, and I am unable to work now. Every day I take less and less care of myself, no one really calls me, or even cares, and I don't blame them I am pretty fucked up because of The Borderline personality disorder. I hate how alone I am all the time, I hate how little support I have. My life for being a American has been pretty fucking shitty. 26 years of some pretty sever social isolation has taken its toll on me, I have been in and out of hospitals the past year. What is the point of life when you have no love, or support? I can't can't change my circumstances, but I'm just done. I don't see a point to even trying anymore. I have just been laying in bed the past week binge watching porn since I cant afford anything to get high off of. Social media makes things worse, it's all just a bunch of assholes flaunting how they have friends and get to do shit. I even had a severely developmentally disabled girl tell me how she is going to get a date tonight, I know that sounds shitty, I don't hold anything against her that's actually awesome that she can do that. I'm looking at things from my shitty perspective, and I honestly don't want to be alive. People just tell me things will get better, blah blah blah. I am on the verge of being homeless, and I have to live everyday knowing that because both my parents are POS's that my life is fucked, my mental state is fucked, and I am going to suffer till the fay I die. I wish I didn't live in a small hell hole, full of ignored conservatives. Seriously the ignorance in my town is astonishing.
