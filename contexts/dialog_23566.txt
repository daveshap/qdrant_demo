ALEX: Is this being recorded?
MCCALL: This is just an informal discussion.
ALEX: Are you recording it?
MCCALL: What does it look like?
ALEX: It looks like he's writing everything down.
MCCALL: That's because he is. Does that upset you?
ALEX: No. Why should it?
MCCALL: Well, then?
ALEX: I've never seen any of these men before.
MCCALL: Take another look at these two.
ALEX: I don't know them.
MCCALL: And if I told you their car was parked outside, would that surprise you?
ALEX: Yes, I suppose so.
ALEX: Well, is it?
MCCALL: What?
ALEX: Parked outside?
MCCALL: No, not any more. I just wondered if it would surprise you.
MCCALL: That's it, then.
ALEX: That's all?
MCCALL: Sorry to waste your time.
ALEX: Oh, no problems. Don't worry.
MCCALL: Just one thing.
ALEX: Yes.
