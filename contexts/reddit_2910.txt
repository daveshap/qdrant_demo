Is 29 too old to go back to school to change careers?
I'm currently employed as a personal care home administrator and as bad as it might sound I just don't find the work fulfilling on a personal level. 

My plan is to go back to college to get an associate's degree in engineering technology. My biggest concern though with going back while working a relatively demanding job is that I'll only be able to mentally and financial manage 1-2 classes per semester. To get my degree I'll need to complete 15 classes so I would be looking at minimum 8  semesters. 

This would mean I'm not going to be able to even start applying for jobs before I'm 33. Do you think it's worth the time, money and effort or should I look to just pivot from my current position to a different job where my developed skills would be found useful?

Any advice is greatly appreciated,
Thank you.

EDIT: Thank you all so much for your great advice and encouragement! I'm going to take all your advice to heart and go to my local college tomorrow evening (placement office only open until 7pm Wed and Thurs) to apply for the spring!
