CLEMENTINE: Says you were closed off, non communicative, never told me what you were feeling.
JOEL: Says you were a bully...
CLEMENTINE: A bully? Moi?
JOEL: That's what it says. You drank too much, you picked on me for being passive and timid.
CLEMENTINE: Well, sounds like me. Sorry, man. Says you were jealous and suspicious.
JOEL: Says you would sometimes disappear all night, then brag to me about your sexual conquests.
CLEMENTINE: Did I use the term sexual conquests" or is that your way of putting it."
JOEL: I don't know.
CLEMENTINE: Doesn't sound like me.
JOEL: Says you were a slob, leaving trails of panties and dirty socks in your wake.
CLEMENTINE: Says you were constantly calling me a slob. It's sexy that we were like a married couple, griping and overly-familiar and bored. Don't you think?
JOEL: I sort of do. But I only see it as a fantasy version of reality. Cleaned up enough to be erotic.
CLEMENTINE: We should have sex. It's old hat for us.
