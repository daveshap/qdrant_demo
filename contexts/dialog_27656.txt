MELANIE: Good morning.
CLERK: Morning.
MELANIE: I wonder if you could help me.
CLERK: Try my best.
MELANIE: I'm looking for a man named Mitchell Brenner.
CLERK: Yep.
MELANIE: Do you know him?
CLERK: Yep.
MELANIE: Where does he live?
CLERK: Right here. Bodega Bay.
MELANIE: Yes, but where?
CLERK: Right across the bay there.
MELANIE: Where?
CLERK: See where I'm pointing?
MELANIE: Yes?
CLERK: See them two big trees across there?
MELANIE: Yes?
CLERK: And the white house?
MELANIE: That's where the Brenners live.
MELANIE: The Brenners? Mr. and Mrs. Brenner?
CLERK: Nope, just Lydia and the two kids.
MELANIE: The two kids?
CLERK: Yep. Mitch and the little girl.
MELANIE: I see. How do I get down there?
CLERK: Follow the road straight through town 'til it curves off on the left. That'll take you right around the bay to their front door.
MELANIE: The front door. Isn't there a back road I can take?
CLERK: Nope. That's the road. Straight through town, stay on your left, right around the bay to the front door.
MELANIE: You see, I wanted to surprise them.
CLERK: Mmmm.
MELANIE: I didn't want to come right down the road, where they could see me.
CLERK: Mmmm.
MELANIE: It's a surprise, you see.
CLERK: Mmmmmm. 'Course, you could get yourself a boat, cut right across the bay with it. The Brenners got a little dock there you could tie up at. If that's what you wanted to do.
MELANIE: Where would I get a boat?
CLERK: Down at the dock by the Tides Restaurant. Ever handled an outboard boat?
MELANIE: Of course.
CLERK: D'you want me to order one for you?
MELANIE: Thank you.
CLERK: What name?
MELANIE: Daniels.
CLERK: Okay.
MELANIE: I wonder if you could tell me...
CLERK: Yep?
MELANIE: The little girl's name.
CLERK: The little Brenner girl?
MELANIE: Yes.
CLERK: Alice, I think. Harry, what's the little Brenner girl's name?
HARRY'S VOICE: What?
CLERK: The little Brenner girl.
HARRY'S VOICE: Lois!
CLERK: It's Alice, ain't it?
HARRY'S VOICE: No, it's Lois!
CLERK: It's Alice.
MELANIE: Are you sure?
CLERK: Well, I ain't positive, if that's what you mean.
MELANIE: I need her exact name, you see.
CLERK: That case, I tell you what you do. You go straight through town 'til you see a little hotel on your left there. Not the motel, that's the other end of town. This is the hotel. Now you take a right turn there, you got that?
MELANIE: Yes?
CLERK: Near the top of the hill, you'll see the school and right behind it, the church. You head for the school. Now just past the school, you'll see a little house with a red mail box. That's where Annie Hayworth lives, she's the school teacher. You ask her about the little Brenner girl.
MELANIE: Thank you.
CLERK: Yep. Could save yourself a lot of trouble. Her name's Alice for sure.
MELANIE: Can I have the boat in about twenty minutes?
MELANIE: How much for the phone calls?
CLERK: It's nothing.
