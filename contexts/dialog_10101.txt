DEREK: You know, I'm not sure I could live anywhere else. The nights are always so peaceful and quiet.
CHRIS: It's deceiving.
DEREK: What do you mean?
CHRIS: The quiet can fool you. It fooled me. You can never be sure of what's out there.
DEREK: Why did you come back here?
CHRIS: ... To prove something to myself... to prove I'm stronger than I think I am.
DEREK: And, what about us?
CHRIS: I'm here with you. Can't that be enough for now?
DEREK: I don't know. I don't see you for months on end, and when I do, you put this wall between us. How do I break through?
CHRIS: I'm trying. I'm really trying.
DEREK: What happened that night?
CHRIS: You promised you'd never ask me.
DEREK: After you left me that night, I didn't see you or talk to you again for a year. No one would tell me anything. All I know is what the police told me. We have nowhere to go unless you let me in. What happened?
ANDY: ... One thousand twelve... one thousand thirteen... one thousand fourteen... What's the World's Record for this?
SHELLY: According to the Guinness Book, you passed the World's Record several whacks ago.
ANDY: I did?! I broke the world's record.
