VIKTOR: Hey, Lainey. How's your love life?
LAINEY: I do okay. How about you?
VIKTOR: You know me -- married to my work.
LAINEY: I noticed.
LAINEY: Dad, you know I don't like to get between you and mom but she's feeling down right now. She broke up with Kent.
VIKTOR: Really? Too bad.
LAINEY: She thinks you're with Simone.
VIKTOR: Lainey, you know Simone and I don't have a real relationship.
LAINEY: I know but Mom doesn't. Maybe if it came from Simone, if Simone spoke to Mom -- she could straighten things out. Dinner, maybe.
VIKTOR: Dinner? Dinner's difficult. A phone call?
LAINEY: Too impersonal. They have to meet face-to-face.
VIKTOR: I'll see what I can do. You know, Lainey. I don't believe you've ever once asked to meet Simone. Don't you like her?
LAINEY: I love her but that doesn't mean I need to meet her.
