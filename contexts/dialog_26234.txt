KANSAS: Screw Lucy!
GRANDMOTHER: Kansas?
GRANDMOTHER: Is that you down there?
KANSAS: Shit! Yeah, Grandma. Me and the squad.
GRANDMOTHER: Are you girls talking about boys? Practicing kissing your hands?
KANSAS: Oh yeah, you caught us...
GRANDMOTHER: Oh well, then I'll put some cookies at the top of the stairs for you gals.
KANSAS: Thanks! That'd be great.
GRANDMOTHER: You got that big retarded girl down there?
KANSAS: Uh...Yeah, Grandma. She doesn't mean that. Kinda lost the old filter with her last stroke.
GRANDMOTHER: Then I'll throw a few more treats on the plate. Where's my smokes?
KANSAS: I'll get them before Touched by an Angel
GRANDMOTHER: You damn well better...
