I seriously considered driving 6 hours to see a guy who communicates with me via Snapchat
Who
- never asked for my number 
- only hits me up at night 
- joked that I come get a hotel room near him and I SERIOUSLY CONSIDERED CUZ I AM THAT RIDICULOUS 

advice on how to gain self respect back after that act of stupidity 

Oh and when I told him I was gonna come he goes “don’t force it if you can’t” 

It took his passive rejection for me to realize how stupid I was being

*this is someone I in fact know, not a catfish lol
