Which specific law of physics is broken by the \"double jump\"? So, there's a cliche in computer gaming known as a \"double jump\". This can be described as:<blockquote>  A character jumps from a solid surface, and then is able to extend their jump by carrying out the jump action again in mid-air, starting their ballistic arc again from that position.</blockquote>I appreciate that, barring some rocket propulsion, this is not physically possible, but which specific law would have to be suspended in game dynamics in order to allow this to happen?
