Seniors: You need to watch this documentary, especially if you’re a woman
TW: Sexual assault

I go to an all girls school and every year since 2016, we have shortened day where senior classes are suspended so we can watch The Hunting Ground and have a discussion on it. The Hunting Ground is basically about college’s and official’s responses on sexual assault on college campuses. It focuses on institutions such as UNC Chapel Hill, Harvard, Notre Dame, FSU, and more and, for the luck of a better term, their shrugging off of sexual assault claims. I believe every senior who’s about to start college in the fall watch this documentary and statistics saying between 1 in 4-5 undergraduate women being sexually assaulted on campuses, it’s especially vital for young women to watch it. It’ll break your heart, piss you off, and give you hope at the same time.

EDIT: According to RAINN, the national assault telephone hotline, [“Among undergraduate students, 23.1% of females and 5.4% of males experience rape or sexual assault through physical force, violence, or incapacitation.”](https://www.rainn.org/statistics/campus-sexual-violence). However, if RAINN isn’t enough for you, the National Sexual Violence Resource Center also cites [1 in 5](https://www.nsvrc.org/sites/default/files/publications_nsvrc_factsheet_media-packet_statistics-about-sexual-violence_0.pdf) , citing the National Criminal Justice Reference Service


And so what if the stats are lower than one in four or one in five? Hell, we had a panel of speakers after the documentary and one who works for our states largest public university said its predicated at their particular college it’s one in three. Anyway, it’s still vital to raise awareness on sexual assault, especially the cover up by colleges across the country.


EDIT 2: Also, I’ve heard the argument that you can’t look at surveys you have to look at reported rapes. However, assuming the statistic reported in the documentary is correct, 88% of rapes that happen on college campuses are NOT reported. Finally, I’ll leave you with one of the most reliable and recent sources out there. The Association of American Universities released their 2019 sexual conduct and misconduct report in October. 181,000 college students were surveyed. [They found that 26.4% of women reported nonconsensual sexual contact by physical force or inability to consent. ](https://www.aau.edu/sites/default/files/AAU-Files/Key-Issues/Campus-Safety/Revised%20Aggregate%20report%20%20and%20appendices%201-7_(01-16-2020_FINAL).pdf)
