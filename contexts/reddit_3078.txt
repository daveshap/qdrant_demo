Why is employer branding so fake?
I have 10+ years of work experience and was asked more than 3 times to be put on camera or have a picture of me posted on the company website and a text how awesome the company is. Deep down I knew that it was so much fake, but the request came from the senior management and who wants to sabotages his/her career?
They (big pharmaceutical company) claimed that they are family friendly or promote work-life balance, while I was not even allowed to do home office regularly with my office job.

In summary: I donâ€™t know if any of these online advertisements are true and was wondering if you had the same experience?
