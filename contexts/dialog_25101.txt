SEFTON: Or how about a game of pinochle? No, you're not a pinochle man. You're a chess player. I haven't played since I was a kid. Let's see -- -- a pawn moves this way, doesn't it? And a bishop this way? And the queen -- every which way, doesn't it?
PRICE: Suppose you just sit down and keep your mouth shut.
SEFTON: I went to school with a guy named Price. But that was in Boston. You're from Cleveland, aren't you.
PRICE: Yes, I'm from Cleveland.
SEFTON: I thought that's what you said. You're from Cleveland. And you were with the Thirty-sixth Bomb Group?
PRICE: Thirty-fifth.
SEFTON: Three hundred and sixty-fifth Bomb Squadron? Out of Chelveston?
PRICE: Are you questioning me?
SEFTON: Just getting acquainted. Trying to make one friend in this barracks.
PRICE: Don't bother, Sefton. I don't like you. I never did and I never will.
SEFTON: A lot of people say that and the first thing you know is they get married and live happily ever after. I wonder what they're trying to pull out there?
SEFTON: Ach so!
PRICE: What did you say?
SEFTON: Amazing, what you can do with five thousand ping-pong balls, isn't it?
PRICE: Stop that, will you! Those idiots! So they sprang Dunbar! So what good is it? He's still in the compound, isn't he? How long can he last? Where can they hide him?
SEFTON: Where. Up Joey's ocarina. Didn't you know?
