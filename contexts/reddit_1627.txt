Today, I’m going to pull a HUGE April fool’s day prank. On Friday, I told everyone that I got rejected from my dream school since birth, Stanford. It was very touching to see all my friends reaching out to console me. I can’t wait to see their faces when I tell them I actually got in.
Jk I got rejected, real salty boi hours. Get prank’d
