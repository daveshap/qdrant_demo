Stepping down
When I became a mod of /r/ApplyingToCollege on August 1, 2016, there were 6,220 subscribers and it looked like [this](https://web.archive.org/web/20160801210734/https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege). 

Within 2 weeks, I transitioned the sub to the [burnt orange colors](https://web.archive.org/web/20160815205121/https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege) some of you may remember. I kinda miss it: who knows, maybe someday we'll go back to that.

By January of 2017, we looked into the future and set the mission statement for A2C that we still stand by to this day: that is, to be the premier forum for college admissions questions, advice, and discussions, from college essays and scholarships to SAT/ACT test prep, career guidance, and more. Since then, we've come a long way and I think we've more than delivered on that vision: by some estimates, A2C has been getting more pageviews per day than CC.

After nearly 4 years, it's time for me to step back and focus on my life goals. To that end, I need to reduce my internet consumption and for me that means quitting reddit.

Your new top moderator will be the wonderful /u/admissionsmom: it goes without saying that the sub is in great hands. The rest of the mod team is doing an amazing job and they have my full confidence. We've had some great retired mods over the years as well: shoutout especially to /u/ivsamhth5, /u/ask_admissions, /u/GammaHuman, and /u/BlueLightSpcl. 

As for advice, I'll say that you are the only thing standing between you and your dreams. No matter how difficult it may seem, no matter what everyone else is doing, no matter what obstacles you face, you always have the power to make your own destiny. Remember this and you will go far.

Best of luck to all of you, and thanks for the memories: I hope you all get into the college of your dreams. Without further ado, here are some of my favorite posts from over the years:
