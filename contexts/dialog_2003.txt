MELVIN: No touch. No touch. No touch.
FRANK: You may think you can intimidate the whole world with your attitude, but I grew up in Hell. My grandmother had more attitude. You don't intimidate me.
MELVIN: Police! Police! Fucking crooked police... doughnut-munching morons help me! Assault and battery and you're black.
FRANK: Shhhh now. I like Simon. I like him enough to batter you unrecognizable if you verbally abuse him or so much as touch his dog again. Meanwhile, I'll try and think how you can make this up to him. I hate doing this. I'm an art dealer. Have a nice day. Party!
