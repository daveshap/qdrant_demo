Currently a content writer wanting to advance by position, should I get a diploma on digital marketing or web development?
Hi, 23F here. Right now I'm working as a content writer on paper but really, my company makes me do copywriting (ad copies and landing pages) and basically all forms of writing (from web pages to video content etc).

I feel stuck as is and I dont think I'll go very far as *just* a writer. I want to be able to be a manager of sorts and be more involved in marketing (I already kinda handle our company social media and do basic edits on WordPress).

My plan is to enroll in a 1 yr diploma program abroad (half for skills advancement and half to get out of my country) and rn I can't decide if I should get a diploma in web development or digital marketing. I'm kind of really interested in web dev because I find fixing the minor changes in the website a bit fun. My coding knowledge is pretty basic (like HTML stuff from HS) so maybe my opinion is biased. But I feel like if I pick web development, I'd get stuck at some point cus I dont have marketing knowledge. So I'm considering just going straight to learning digital marketing so I have more useful skills in advancing myself in the future.

My background is just a bachelor's degree on International Studies and 2-3 ish years working as a content writer/copywriter but both companies I've worked it involved me handling their social media and website too.

What do you guys think is the best choice to study: Web Dev or Digital Marketing? Or are there other diploma courses I should consider that can help me advance?
