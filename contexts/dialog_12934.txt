DENNIS: Talley?
TALLEY: I'm here.
DENNIS: I want a helicopter to take us to Mexico.
TALLEY: That's not going to happen, Dennis. They won't give you a helicopter.
DENNIS: I'll give you these people.
TALLEY: The Mexican police would arrest you as soon as it landed. There's only one way out and you're doing it right now--just keep talking to us. I think we could make the transition now. Maddox, you good to go?
TALLEY: Hey, Dennis? Can I let you in on a personal secret?
DENNIS: What?
TALLEY: I gotta piss real bad.
DENNIS: You're a funny guy, Talley.
TALLEY: I'm going to put on an officer named Will Maddox. You talk to him for a while.
TALLEY: He says he has gasoline set to burn the place.
MARTIN: Jesus. He must've siphoned it from the cars.
TALLEY: If you go in, you can't use tear gas or flashbangs. The whole place would go up.
MARTIN: Looks like you're bailing out at the right time.
TALLEY: That's why you get the big bucks, Captain.
LOUISE'S VOICE: Chief, base.
TALLEY: Go.
LOUISE'S VOICE: I couldn't find Jane. She wasn't at the restaurant.
TALLEY: You have her cell number?
LOUISE'S VOICE: She didn't answer.
TALLEY: They might be at the house. Keep trying and let me know. I'm going to be here a little while longer.
