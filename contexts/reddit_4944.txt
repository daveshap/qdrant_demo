Proud of myself still keeping my shit together
The fall this year is brutal. One moment it is nice and sunny, and the next one it’s a gloomy Gothic hell. It’s gonna be like that for the next 7 months where I live (think Eastern Europe). My therapist says she has an influx of new clients. I’m mostly okay, but sometimes I just get an urge to step into traffic. It’s been generally a shitty year. I thought I’d recovered from depression. I’ve been healthy for 4 years before that, but it’s been too much lately. I moved from my dorms to live alone, broke up with my best friend of 10 years, faced the worst creative block in my life in my first year of art school, was assaulted by a stalker, went through bureaucratic hell trying to file a police report, fucked some nasty stranger because he said I had nice butt, and, finally, experienced a bad acid trip. There were, of course, a lot of good things. I feel like I’m finally getting out of an artistic stasis and ditching drugs for good, therapy and meditation are helping lots, I kinda made up with the friend and had many great moments with other friends, and had a blast at a summer music festival. Although, you know how it is - depression makes you focused on negative stuff specifically. Every day I do my best to get just a little peace of mind, but it feels like a Sisyphus’ task. There is always a scary tiny voice that’s telling me I don’t really deserve all of that self-care, showering and stuff, not jumping under buses, things like that. Turns out, it’s possible to be ungrateful and distrustful towards your own self.
The best thing that’s happening right now is that I’m finally getting the courage to tell my story (mainly, writing shitty poetry and showing it to friends. Or anonymous Reddit posts). I’m also going to book an appointment with a psychiatrist as soon as I have money. So we’ll see. Maybe I’m not a Sisyphus but the proverbial frog after all.
