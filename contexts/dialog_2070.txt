BAIN: Why? What happened?
RATH: Didn't you here all them sirens? It's been all over the radio. Some guy shot Leevio Valli, and a bunch of bystanders, in the Trattoria Roma.
BAIN: No shit.
RATH: Yeah, it's terrible. I mean Valli, and I don't care what office he's running for, the guy's a crook. He probably had it coming, but all the other people. Real sad.
BAIN: Yeah.
RATH: But they caught the guy. I heard it all. Sounded like he just went berserk, fucking loco. Shooting anybody. Drugs, probably.
BAIN: Probably.
RATH: I'd love to sit in that jury. Send that S.O.B. right to the chair.
