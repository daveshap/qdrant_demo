I’m seventeen, grew up in poverty and likely gonna be homeless in a couple months. After saving for six years, I opened my first independent bank account with a balance of $700!
Super stoked. I’m dual enrolled in high school and community college, so I was able to open a college account without a parent co-signing. I’ve been stressing about money my whole life. It feels really good to have it all safe and in one place - six years of birthday money, selling old clothes, tutoring, and lots of odd jobs and miscellaneous bets. I know it’s not enough to subsist on my own, but I feel much better with something to lean on.

Edit: thanks for the kind words, everyone!
