Today is my cake day AND my actual birthday.
And for several years I’ve down played my birthday because of anxiety. Anxious about the attention. Anxious about organising a party and no one coming, anxious about everyone forgetting. So I’ve just not told people it’s my birthday and I’ve not organised anything. 

But this year I did tell people at my work. I told people who I’ve made friends with online, I went out for a meal. 

It has been a great day and I think it’s the first time in a long time I’ve really enjoyed my birthday. It also feel great to have let down a wall.


Edit: thanks for all the birthday messages :) love you all.
